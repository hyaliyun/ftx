He was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 2000, having previously held the role of Minister for Economic Affairs between 1988 and 1990. He was a Member of Parliament (Folketinget) for the Danish Social Liberal Party from 1966 to 1974, 1977 to 1993, and again from 1994 to 2011.  Early life  Niels Helveg Petersen was born in Odense in 1939. His parents were former cabinet minister Kristen Helveg Petersen and former Mayor of Copenhagen Lilly Helveg Petersen. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1965, earning a cand.jur. degree. From 1961 to 1962, he spent a year as an exchange student at Stanford University studying Government. During his years in Copenhagen he was an active member of the youth branch of the Danish Social Liberal Party, editing their paper 'Libert√©'. Political career =Member of Parliament 1966‚Äì2011= Niels Helveg Petersen ran for election to the Danish Parliament for the first time in 1964. In 1966, he was elected a Member of Parliament for the first time in the Frederiksborg County. In 1974, he left Denmark to become a civil servant in the European Commission. He returned to Danish politics in 1977, this time being elected to parliament standing in the Funen constituency. He became leader of the Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: Radikale Venstre) in 1978 and kept this role until 1990. During the 1980s, he supported the economic policies of the Conservative-Liberal government. At the same time, he supported the opposition on other questions such as security policies. In doing so, his party created majorities without the parties in government, a practice that became known as 'footnote politics'.Fodnotepolitikken og det alternative politiske flertal In supporting different sides of parliament, he was sometimes referred to by the Danish media as a 'king maker', deciding which policies would pass and which would not.Kongemageren Niels Helveg Petersen The Social Liberal's footnote politics ended in 1988 when the party entered the government coalition. In April 2008, Niels Helveg Petersen announced that he was not standing at the next election that took place in September 2011.Niels Helveg Petersen stopper i politik - Politiken.dk =Minister for Economic Affairs 1988‚Äì90= He was Minister for Economic Affairs in the Cabinet of Poul Schl√ºter III from 3 June 1988 to 18 December 1990, when his party left the government coalition after poor election results in 1990. He consequently also stepped down as party leader. =Minister of Foreign Affairs 1993‚Äì2000= He was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs from 25 January 1993 to 21 December 2000 in the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I, II, III, and IV (except for the last part of the IV cabinet). When the European Union's Maastricht Treaty was rejected by the Danish people in 1992, it was accepted after a referendum in 1993 adding certain opt-out concessions for Denmark. As the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Niels Helveg Petersen had to work to implement those concessions, although he had been a long supporter of greater internationalisation of Danish foreign policy. When he left the position of Foreign Minister in 2000, the official reason given was that he could no longer accept the opt-outs. He joined the newly created Council of the Baltic Sea States, which in 1993 successfully established the EuroFaculty in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius, of which he became an active supporter.Kristensen, Gustav N. 2010. Born into a Dream. EuroFaculty and the Council of the Baltic Sea States. Berliner Wissentshafts-Verlag. . Personal life Niels Helveg Petersen was married to Kirsten Lee, who is also a former member of the Danish Parliament for the Social Liberal Party. His son Morten Helveg Petersen was member of the parliament from 11 March 1998 and until August 2009. His son Rasmus Helveg Petersen was member of parliament 2011-2015 and again from 2019, and a cabinet minister 2013‚Äì2015.

Genomes or cDNA sequences from two samples (i.e. cancer sample and a normal sample) are PCR amplified and differences analyzed using subtractive DNA hybridization. This technology has been further enhanced through the development of representation oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA), which uses array technology to perform such analyses. This method may also be adapted to detect DNA methylation differences, as seen in methylation- sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA). Theory This method relies on PCR to differentially amplify non-homologous DNA regions between digested fragments of two nearly identical DNA species, that are called 'driver' and 'tester' DNA. Typically, tester DNA contains a sequence of interest that is non-homologous to driver DNA. When the two species are mixed, the driver sequence is added in excess to tester. During PCR, double stranded fragments first denature at ~95¬∞C and then re-anneal when subjected to the annealing temperature. Since driver and tester sequences are nearly identical, the excess of driver DNA fragments will anneal to homologous DNA fragments from the tester species. This blocks PCR amplification and there is no increase in homologous fragments. However, fragments that are different between the two species will not anneal to a complementary counterpart and will be amplified by PCR. As more cycles of RDA are performed, the pool of unique sequence fragment copies will grow faster than fragments found in both species. References *Lisitsyn N, Lisitsyn N, Wigler M.

Hollandic or Hollandish ( ) is the most widely spoken dialect of the Dutch language. Other important Low Franconian language varieties spoken are together with Brabantian, Flemish (East Flemish, West Flemish), Zeelandic and Limburgish. History Hollandic (in red) within the Low Franconian-speaking area. Originally in the later County of Holland, Old Frisian was spoken. Low Franconian settlers did not come until the 12th and 13th centuries , when Flemish settlers, speaking Frankish, played an important part in draining the swamplands between the coast of Holland and the city of Utrecht. They mixed with the original inhabitants, and a Hollandic dialect was created that was partly Franconian and partly Frisian . In the 16th century, Dutch was standardised, with the Brabantian dialect of Antwerp being the most influential one, according to many linguists. The written language of the County of Holland, which was the most urbanised area in Europe, began to imitate the Brabantian standard. During the Eighty Years' War, especially after 1585, the Sack of Antwerp and the 1580s successes of the Duke of Parma made between 100,000 and 200,000 of Brabantish and Flemish, many Calvinist, settle in the cities of Holland proper. The refugees caused a mixture of their dialects with those of the people who were already there. The new language replaced most of the original Hollandic dialects with Brabantian influences and further diluted the Frisian influences on Dutch. That certainly slowed linguistic change by the influence on spoken language of the very conservative written standard. As a result, Standard Dutch has kept many features of late-16th-century Brabantian. Distance from standard language The colloquial Dutch in Holland proper (the area of the old County of Holland), particularly the Hollandic now spoken in some urban areas, is closer to Standard Dutch than anywhere else. Shades of other dialects In Friesland, there are areas and cities in which Hollandic is spoken but strongly influenced by West Frisian. In the north of North Holland, especially in the region of West Friesland, Scheveningen, Katwijk and other coastal places, the original West Frisian substratum of the Hollandic dialect is still an important part of the local West Frisian dialect group. In Zaanstreek (central North Holland), a traditional region, the old Hollandic dialect, Zaans, is still found but with little West Frisian influence. Some words are similar because of the influence of migrating West Frisian farmers in the 13th to the 15th centuries. Zaans can be seen as one of the few (together with Westfries) and oldest original Hollandic dialects and is still spoken today, like the old Waterlands dialect, which exists as well in Volendam. Both Zaans and Waterlands are unintelligible for someone who does not come from that region in North Holland. However, people who speak Zaans, West Frisian or Waterlands are able to understand one another better than outsiders because all three dialects use similar words. On the South Holland island of Goeree-Overflakkee, West Flemish is spoken. In the east and south, the Hollandic dialects gradually become Brabantian forms like the South Guelderish. Utrechts- Alblasserwaards, spoken in the area immediately east of the coastal districts, is considered to be a subdialect of Hollandic or a separate dialect.

VAERS is a postmarketing surveillance program, collecting information about adverse events (possible harmful side effects) that occur after administration of vaccines to ascertain whether the risk‚Äìbenefit ratio is high enough to justify continued use of any particular vaccine. VAERS, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network are tools by which the CDC and FDA monitor vaccine safety to fulfill their duty as regulatory agencies charged with protecting the public. VAERS has limitations, including unverified reports, misattribution, underreporting, and inconsistent data quality. CDC cautions that it is generally not possible to find out from VAERS data if a vaccine caused the adverse event, or how common the event might be. Origins The program is an outgrowth of the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which requires health care providers to report: *Any event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccine. *Any event listed in the Reportable Events Table that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. The data are stored electronically by the CDC in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VAERS was established in 1990 and is managed jointly by the FDA and the CDC. It is meant to act as a sort of \\"early warning system\\"‚Äîa way for physicians and researchers to identify possible unforeseen reactions or side effects of vaccination for further study. Operation Each year the VAERS receives at least 50,000 reports of adverse events following immunization by more than 10 million vaccines. Higher-priority uses of the data include reports of death and other serious adverse events, recognizing and detecting adverse effects, and finding unexpected adverse events involving new vaccines. The VAERS data are also used to monitor known reactions to vaccines and for vaccine lot surveillance. Data mining techniques such as empirical Bayes methods can be used to improve the quality of data analysis. Limitations Like other spontaneous reporting systems, VAERS has several limitations, including underreporting, unverified reports, inconsistent data quality, and inadequate data about the number of people vaccinated. Indeed, an autism activist named Jim Laidler once reported to VAERS that a vaccine had turned him into The Incredible Hulk. The report was accepted and entered into the database, but the dubious nature thereof prompted a VAERS representative to contact Mr. Laidler, who then gave his consent to delete the report. Use in research and litigation Many medical researchers make use of VAERS to study the effects of vaccination. VAERS warns researchers using its database that the data should not be used in isolation to draw conclusions about cause and effect. Nonetheless, data from VAERS has been used in vaccine litigation to support the claim that vaccines cause autism. Litigation related to vaccines and autism has led to an increase in VAERS reports filed by plaintiff's attorneys. A 2006 article in Pediatrics found that most VAERS reports related to thimerosal, and many related to autism, were filed in connection with litigation, leading the authors to caution that inappropriate reliance on VAERS data may be a source of bias. The study's lead author stated: \\"Lawyers are manipulating this system to show increases [in vaccine-related adverse events] that are based on litigation, not health research.\\" Paul Offit, chief of infectious disease at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, wrote: > Public health officials were disappointed to learn that reports of autism to > VAERS weren't coming from parents, doctors, nurses, or nurse practitioners; > they were coming from personal-injury lawyers ...

Lady Eaton and her husband, Sir John Craig Eaton acquired the land in 1920 and 1922 on recommendation from their friend Sir Henry Pellatt, who owned the nearby Mary Lake property. Lady Eaton moved into Eaton Hall three years after selling her city mansion, Ardwold. The house is adjacent to a body of water named Lake Jonda (a combination of the first three letters of her son John David Eaton's first and middle names), and nestled within the temperate forests of King Township. Upon completion, it contained 72 rooms. It became a beloved gathering place for the Eaton Family, owners of the Eaton's department stores based in Toronto. History Site plans and surveys for the property dating from 1921 to the 1930s all refer to its location being in Eversley. Design was started in 1932 by architects Peter L. Allward and George Roper Gouinlock, son of architect George Wallace Gouinlock (later by firm Allward and Gouinlock). Construction was completed in 1939 and was supervised by John W. Bowser of the Aurora Building Company. Its construction incorporated stones sourced from the nearby Humber River. A history of the estate, Eaton Hall: Pride of King Township, was written by local author and historian Kelly Mathews, published by The History Press, an imprint of Dundurn Press in June 2015. Further uses Flora Eaton was a member of the Toronto Hunt Club. In 1929, it split into the Eglinton Hunt Club and the Toronto and North York Hunt Club. Hunters of the latter held regular outings, meeting for breakfast at Eaton Hall, riding in the adjacent Pellatt Estate, then ending the day with an afternoon tea at Eaton Hall. During WWII, the property was used as a convalescent hospital and rehabilitation centre for the Royal Canadian Navy from 1944 to 1946. After Lady Eaton's death in 1970, the land was sold to Seneca College, which was then a provincially funded college of applied arts and technology. It established its King Campus operations on that land in 1971, using Eaton Hall as its administrative facility. In 1977, a new facility was built for the expanding college, and Eaton Hall became a Management Development Centre until 1991, at which time it was converted to a public hotel and conference centre. Filming location Many movies and television programs have been filmed at Eaton Hall, including Death Weekend, Mrs. Winterbourne, and the final scene of the award-winning film A History of Violence.

Each member of the JCP belongs to a local group, in his or her school, town, or work place. These groups belong to a regional organization, usually at district level. The regional organization holds regional activities, and is managed by a regional committee. In a different level, the JCP divides its work and structure in three main sector level organizations: the organization of the intermediate and high school students, the organization of the university and college students, and a last one to the young working people. Each of these co-ordinates the work and the activities related to each corresponding sector.

It is considered an anti-pattern. The original definition is by Michael Akroyd 1996 - Object World West Conference: :\\"As a gypsy wagon or a poltergeist appears and disappears mysteriously, so does this short lived object. As a consequence the code is more difficult to maintain and there is unnecessary resource waste. The typical cause for this antipattern is poor object design.\\" A poltergeist can often be identified by its name; they are often called \\"manager_\\", \\"controller_\\", \\"supervisor\\", \\"start_process\\", etc. Sometimes, poltergeist classes are created because the programmer anticipated the need for a more complex architecture. For example, a poltergeist arises if the same method acts as both the client and invoker in a command pattern, and the programmer anticipates separating the two phases. However, this more complex architecture may actually never materialize. Poltergeists should not be confused with long-lived, state-bearing objects of a pattern such as model-view-controller, or tier-separating patterns such as business-delegate. To remove a poltergeist, delete the class and insert its functionality in the invoked class, possibly by inheritance or as a mixin.

Taylor and produced by the Playwrights' Company. It ran on Broadway for a total of 318 performances, opening at the National Theatre on November 11, 1953. Directed by H. C. Potter, with sets and lights designed by Donald Oenslager, it starred Margaret Sullavan and Joseph Cotten, with Cathleen Nesbitt, John Cromwell, and Russell Collins in major supporting roles. The critic for The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson, praised both the script and the production for its droll wit, writing that \\"One of the most attractive qualities of Sabrina Fair is the opportunity it provides for enjoying the foibles and crises of some fairly scrupulous human beings.\\" For Atkinson, the play's clever dialogue placed it beyond a Cinderella romance and into the more exalted realm of high comedy, in the tradition of S. N. Behrman, Philip Barry, and W. Somerset Maugham. Plot Sabrina Fairchild is the daughter of a chauffeur to the wealthy Larrabee family, who live in a mansion on the North Shore of Long Island. Returning from a stay in Paris after working as the private secretary to the \\"Assistant Economic Commissioner Office of Special Representative for Europe Economic Cooperation Administration\\", she presents herself as a young woman of beauty, charm, incredible sophistication and zest for living, so different from the domestic's daughter the family had largely ignored. She proclaims her desire \\"to do everything and see everything, sense everything; to know that life is an enormous experience and must be used. To be in the world, and of the world, and never stand aside and watch.\\" Although she once had a crush on David Larrabee, the young playboy of the family, and returns to America with a wealthy French suitor in tow, she finds herself drawn to Linus Larrabee, whose intelligence, lack of sentimentality, and knowledge of the world stimulates her. She, out of all the Larabees, sees something about Linus. When it's revealed that Sabrina's father has amassed a fortune on the stock market over the past decades, she wants to return to Paris that she feels is her home. Linus as her financial, as well as intellectual, equal causes her to fall in love permanently with Linus. The title cites John Milton's song from his masque Comus (1634), which is quoted in the play: With its patrician setting, witty dialogue, and development of a romantic plot between two clever and committed idealists across class lines, Sabrina Fair has much in common with Philip Barry's comedy Holiday. Films The play is the basis for the 1954 film Sabrina, directed by Billy Wilder, and its 1995 remake of the same name directed by Sydney Pollack. Wilder's extensive revision of the plot led to Taylor's quitting the project and his replacement by Ernest Lehman. References =Sources= * Further reading * External links * Plays by Samuel A.

Music career Born in Phoenix, Arizona, as the great-grandson of Prussian immigrants, Welnick started playing keyboards as a teenager. He joined a band, the Beans, which eventually morphed into the Tubes, a San Francisco-based theater rock band popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s and noted for early live performances that combined lewd quasi-pornography with wild satires of media, consumerism and politics. The Tubes in the 1980s were a major commercial rock act with substantial MTV success. Videos for \\"Talk to Ya Later\\" and \\"She's a Beauty\\" played in heavy rotation on MTV in the mid-1980s. While playing in the Tubes, Welnick also played and recorded with Todd Rundgren. When Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland died of a drug overdose on July 26, 1990, the band began auditioning players to replace him, including Ian McLagan, Pete Sears and T Lavitz. Welnick was selected, not least for his high vocal range for backup harmonies. Welnick's first show with the Grateful Dead was on September 7, 1990 at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio. His Associated Press obituary mentioned he was so nervous at his first gig with the band that he could barely play, until the fans put him at ease. They held up banners reading, \\"Yo Vinnie,\\" which Welnick later decided to use as the name of his BMI-affiliated publishing company, Yo Vinnie Music, once obtaining his writer and publisher rights back from Ice Nine Publishing, which had copyrighted his works without an agreement in place to do so shortly after Welnick joined the Grateful Dead. Bruce Hornsby also supplemented Welnick on grand piano for over 100 shows in Welnick's first years in the Dead. Welnick remained as a member of the Grateful Dead and the band's keyboard player until Jerry Garcia's death in August 1995, when the group disbanded. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead. Welnick became depressed following a diagnosis of cancer and emphysema shortly before the final Grateful Dead tour. He decided to do the summer 1995 Grateful Dead tour and wait to have surgery after it ended. Shortly after the tour was over, Jerry Garcia died. Welnick joined Bob Weir's new group, Ratdog, as the keyboard player, touring with them around the U.S. About six months after Garcia's death, Welnick attempted suicide on the tour bus to Monterey, California. He received therapy, successful cancer treatment, and management of the early stages of lung disease. He worked with the band Second Sight, with Bob Bralove, and with Missing Man Formation, which released an album that included the song \\"Golden Days\\", a tribute to Garcia. He participated in the second Phil Lesh and Friends show in March 1998, and he toured the U.S. with the Mickey Hart Band later that year. In 2002, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, and Phil Lesh regrouped under the name \\"The Other Ones\\". According to musician and publisher Mike Lawson, Welnick was troubled when the Grateful Dead reunited without him under the name the \\"Surviving Members of Grateful Dead\\". He toured with jam bands, recorded music in his home studio, and worked with friends on their albums. With the band Mood Food he finished a reggae version of \\"To Love Somebody\\" by the Bee Gees. He left behind hundreds of hours of unreleased materials, both personal and professional recordings. During his final years, he worked closely with Gent Treadly. Greenhaus, Mike https://jambands.com/features/2003/11/28/not-just-the-missing-man-vince- welnick-jams-with-gent-treadly/ Jambands.com Film Welnick played a small part in the 1981 film Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains. Fee Waybill of the Tubes played Lou Corpse, the washed-up front man of a band called The Metal Corpses. Welnick played Jerry Jervey, the guitar player (though the reporter calls him the bass player) with the Corpses, who dies of an overdose in a backstage bathroom. Welnick also appeared in Xanadu, along with the rest of the Tubes. Death On June 2, 2006, Vince Welnick died by suicide by slitting his throat, after battling depression for 10 years.

Since the closure of its original brewery in Henley-on-Thames in 2002, most of its beers have been brewed by Wychwood Brewery in West Oxfordshire. In 1993, beer writer Michael Jackson described its \\"ordinary\\" bitter as the best in England. History In 1711, W.H. Brakspear bought a brewery on Bell Street, Henley-on-Thames. The Brakspear family was distantly related to Nicholas Breakspear, who became Pope Adrian IV in 1154 ‚Äî the only Englishman to become Pope. In 1812, the brewery moved to a Thames-side location on New Street. The brewery was used in 1990 episode of Inspector Morse \\"Sins of the Fathers\\". In 2002, W.H. Brakspear & Sons licensed the brewing of its beers to Refresh UK, owner of Wychwood Brewery, and the brewery ceased production and closed. The site was sold and part of it converted to a Hotel du Vin boutique hotel. The now non-brewing Brakspear Pub Company and its estate of 104 pubs was bought in 2006 by pub chain JT Davies for ¬£106 million; the 51 Davies pubs were rebranded as Brakspear. After being brewed at Burtonwood, Cheshire, production of Brakspear beers was moved, along with some of the historic Henley brewing vessels, to Refresh's Wychwood Brewery in Witney, Oxfordshire. Refresh UK was subsequently bought out by Marston's. In spring 2013 Brakspear Pub Company made a limited return to brewing with the commissioning of the Bell Street Brewery in its Bull public house in Bell Street, Henley-on-Thames. Brewing Brakspear's beer is brewed using the traditional double drop fermentation method. This involves allowing fermentation to start in vessels on an upper floor, before 'dropping' into a second vessel below. This leaves tired or dead yeast and unwanted solids ('trub') behind and encourages a healthier fermentation. Refresh UK claims that Brakspear beers possess a butterscotch flavour due to diacetyl produced through this method and their particular long-lived, multi-strain yeast. The yeast has \\"distant origins\\" at Mann, Crossman & Paulin in Mile End, London. When beer writer Michael Jackson visited in 1993, the barley was Maris Otter and water came from their own well, described as \\"chalk-hard\\". Hops were Goldings from Kent, Hereford Fuggles and \\"Styrians\\". Jackson thought the ordinary bitter the best in England, writing \\"In its delicate, malty sweetness, teasing, yeasty fruitiness, and hoppy bitterness, Brakspear's 'ordinary' is lightly refreshing, gently sociable, more-ish and appetite- arousing; the perfect combination in a bitter. The hoppiness is its salient feature\\". John Mortimer in 1986 claimed \\"Brakspear's draft bitter is undoubtedly the best to be had in England\\". With the opening of the Bell Street Brewery in Henley-on-Thames in spring 2013 a number of beers are brewed including some sold using the Brakspear's beer brand name albeit with point of sale material also showing the brewing provenance as the Bell Street Brewery. Previous Brakspear's beer names Mild, Old Ale and Special have featured at various times, with Special being a regular product.

SPI-4 is an interface for packet and cell transfer between a physical layer (PHY) device and a link layer device, for aggregate bandwidths of OC-192 Asynchronous Transfer Mode and Packet over SONET/SDH (POS), as well as 10 Gigabit Ethernet applications. SPI-4 has two types of transfers‚ÄîData when the RCTL signal is deasserted; Control when the RCTL signal is asserted. The transmit and receive data paths include, respectively, (TDCLK, TDAT[15:0],TCTL) and (RDCLK, RDAT[15:0], RCTL). The transmit and receive FIFO status channels include (TSCLK, TSTAT[1:0]) and (RSCLK, RSTAT[1:0]) respectively. A typical application of SPI-4.2 is to connect a framer device to a network processor. It has been widely adopted by the high speed networking marketplace. The interface consists of (per direction): * sixteen LVDS pairs for the data path * one LVDS pair for control * one LVDS pair for clock at half of the data rate * two FIFO status lines running at 1/8 of the data rate * one status clock The clocking is source-synchronous and operates around 700 MHz. Implementations of SPI-4.2 have been produced which allow somewhat higher clock rates. This is important when overhead bytes are added to incoming packets.

It covers a distance of 740 km and last flooded in 1989. The river also lends its name to Nossob camp in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Course The Nossob has its origin in two main tributaries, the Swart-Nossob and Wit-Nossob, meaning black and white respectively. Both tributaries have their origins in the eastern slopes of the Otjihavera mountain range, east of Windhoek. Their sources are at 1,800m and over 2,000m above sea level respectively. The two river beds have their confluence some 80 km south of Gobabis, which is situated on the bank of the Swart-Nossob. From this confluence the river course passes the settlements of Leonardville and Aranos to arrive at Union's End, South Africa. From Union's End the river bed, forming the Botswana border, meanders through the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park for a distance of over 200 km. It reaches the southern boundary of the game reserve just north of Twee Rivieren Camp, near its confluence with the Auob river. In the Kalahari, the Nossob is said to flow about once a century. However, water does flow underground to provide life for grass and camelthorn trees growing in the river bed. The Nossob may flow briefly after large thunderstorms, causing wildlife to flock to the river. The Nossob ends at a confluence with the Molopo River some 50 km south of Twee Rivieren.

On 1 January 2018 Pithart received the Order of the White Double Cross state award (second class) from Slovak President Andrej Kiska. Political career Pithart was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1960, was active in the Prague Spring, and left the party after the Soviet invasion. He was later one of the most prominent dissidents against the communist regime, and was imprisoned for his activities, including being one of the first signatories of Charter 77. In 1989 he was one of the prominent leaders of the Civic Forum, founded at the start of the Velvet Revolution. Having participated in the negotiations leading to changes to the federal, Czech and Slovak governments, he was appointed Prime Minister of the Czech Socialist Republic. Pithart is often characterised as a philosopher and thinker, rather than a tactical or charismatic leader. His 1990-92 Czech government was unable to deal with the growing power of federal Finance Minister V√°clav Klaus and his increasingly popular Civic Democratic Party, nor growing Slovak nationalism, which culminated in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and defeat for Pithart's Civic Movement party.

The name (\\"Vulture's Cohort\\") was derived from Emilio Butrague√±o's nickname ', the most charismatic and prominent player of the group. The other four members were Sanch√≠s, Rafael Mart√≠n V√°zquez, M√≠chel and Miguel Pardeza. All five players were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy, La F√°brica. Origin The name originated from an El Pa√≠s article written by journalist Julio C√©sar Iglesias entitled \\"Amancio y la quinta del Buitre\\". Originally, the article's title was intended to be simply \\"La Quinta del Buitre\\", however Iglesias remembers that he decided to add Amancio's name after being advised by the paper's editors that writing a 90-line article about a group of kids, \\"'\\", would be excessive. However, that group of young players brought new stamina to the team and they were representatives of the new dynamic that the entire Spanish society was experiencing in those late 1970s and early 1980s. By the time the article was published, all five players were part of Real Madrid's reserves team, Castilla, and the article had a major impact in order to attract the attention towards these young players. At the end of the season, Castilla finished as champions of the 1983‚Äì84 Segunda Divisi√≥n, but by then only M√≠chel was still not incorporated into Real Madrid first team, with the other four having been transferred immediately after the article was published. Sanch√≠s and Mart√≠n V√°zquez were the first to play for Real Madrid's first team, making their debut away at Murcia on 4 December 1983. Coach Alfredo Di St√©fano brought the youngsters in from the start. Both played surprisingly well and Sanch√≠s even scored the winning goal. A few months later, on 5 February 1984, Emilio Butrague√±o made his debut in an away game at C√°diz. El Buitre was an instant sensation and scored twice. Pardeza was added to the first team that same season and M√≠chel followed at the start of the next. Achievements With La Quinta del Buitre at its core (reduced to four members when Pardeza left the club for Zaragoza in 1986) Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning amongst others two UEFA Cups and five Spanish championships in a row. Their record was only blemished by their failure to win the European Cup. All the five players were part of Spain's squad during 1990 FIFA World Cup. In the last minutes of the game against Belgium, la \\"Quinta\\" was reunited on the pitch after the entry of Miguel Pardeza for Julio Salinas. It was the only time during World Cup Finals. Mart√≠n V√°zquez went to play for Torino in 1990. He made a return to Real Madrid in 1992, leaving the club again for good in 1995 (to Deportivo de La Coru√±a). Butrague√±o left the club in 1995 and M√≠chel in 1996. Both went to play for Club Celaya in Mexico. Sanch√≠s was the only member of La Quinta to never play for a club other than Real Madrid. By winning the Champions League twice (in 1998 and 2000), he also managed to accomplish what La Quinta had failed to achieve in its glory days. He retired in 2001 as the last active member of the famous cohort. In 1998, Sanchis was even awarded the Champions League Trophy first, because he was by then the captain of Real Madrid and had played the whole final against Juventus. With the years, \\"Quinta Del Buitre\\" has earned a more generic meaning, being also associated with a brand of football played by Real Madrid in the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the stewardship of coaches Luis Molowny, Leo Beenhakker and John Toshack. During those years, the Madrid club became synonymous with a high-tempo and very skilled, aggressive, style of play. The heated atmosphere then prevailing at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium sometimes pushed the players to go beyond the limits of acceptable behaviour. Real Madrid was during this period a reckless attacking machine, playing without a holding midfielder very often. Comparisons to Gal√°cticos La Quinta del Buitre has been contrasted with the era of the early-to-mid 2000s. This latter period saw Real Madrid adopt a fluid and attacking approach to its football under coach Vicente del Bosque. Unlike the Quinta del Buitre years, which favoured homegrown talent, Del Bosque's side was based mainly on expensive foreign imports such as Lu√≠s Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo. In the meantime, the profile of the supporters attending games at the Santiago Bernab√©u had also changed, an embourgeoisement process meant that the support was no longer as vocal and passionate as in the 1980s. A notorious banner deployed in the stands during that period read \\"'\\", indicating some kind of nostalgia for the fighting spirit and aggressiveness displayed by the Quinta del Buitre. However, most supporters were happy to sit and watch as their heroes dismantled many visiting sides in impressive fashion, for example Manchester United in April 2003. The Gal√°cticos were less dominant domestically than their predecessors, winning only two Ligas titles, in 2000‚Äì01 and 2002‚Äì03. Nevertheless, unlike the Quinta del Buitre, they managed to extend their dominance to Europe, winning three Champions League trophies between 1997 and 2002. It is worth noting that two of these continental titles were won prior to the marquee arrival of Figo, and are therefore not a part of the per se Gal√°cticos period. In a country where football has the dimension of a national passion, the Quinta del Buitre was the engine behind the transformation of Spanish football into a more technically developed attacking style of play and, along with Cruyff's Dream Team, the two dominated a decade of Spanish football.

The group is sometimes referred to as the Air Combat Support Group, as it controls the aircraft used to support the Royal Navy and RAF's front line combat force. Assets under command includes the Strategic and Tactical Air Transport aircraft (including VIP/Communication), the RAF Police, field squadrons of the RAF Regiment, and Air-to-Air Refuelling aircraft. The group headquarters is located alongside Headquarters Air Command at RAF High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire.

Squadrons and Flights at various stations. History No. 2 Group was originally formed as No. 2 (Training) Group on 1 April 1918 at Oxford. The unit was disbanded at RAF Uxbridge on 31 March 1920 as the need for training had lessened following the armistice.Delve 1994, p. 126. The Group was reformed as No. 2 (Bombing) Group on 20 March 1936, with its headquarters base at Abingdon in Oxfordshire. By the outbreak of war Group Headquarters were at RAF Wyton, Cambridgeshire and composed of the following squadrons and Wings; Nos. 18 and 57 Squadrons (composing 70 Wing at RAF Upper Heyford Oxfordshire) ; Nos. 21 and 82 Squadrons (79 Wing, RAF Watton, Norfolk) Nos. 90 and 101 Squadrons (81 Wing, RAF West Raynham Norfolk), Nos. 114 and 139 Squadrons (82 Wing, Wyton) and Nos. 107 and 110 Squadrons (83 Wing, RAF Wattisham Suffolk) 79, 81, 82 and 83 Wings formed part of the Advanced Air Striking Force, and 70 Wing was earmarked for service with the Field Force in France. The force consisted of Bristol Blenheim Mk. IVs and the Blenheim Mk. I. On 3 September 1939, the day war broke out, a Blenheim from 2 Group made the first British operational sortie to cross the German frontier in the Second World War. The following day saw the Group's Blenheims make the first British bombing attack of the war. In April 1940, Norway was invaded by the Germans. In response to a request for air support two Blenheim squadrons, Nos. 110 and 107, were placed on temporary detachment to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, from where they could attack shipping and the German held airfield at Stavanger in southern Norway. The Group carried out intensive operations against the advancing Germans in the Battle of France following their breakthrough of 10 May 1940, suffering heavy losses. On 17 May, twelve crews of No. 82 Squadron left Watton to attack enemy columns near Gembloux. A severe flak barrage split the formation up, allowing Messerschmitt Bf 109s to attack. Only one Blenheim, managed to return to Watton, the rest shot down. No.82 Squadron was again operational just three days later. During June, Blenheims began a new phase by bombing Luftwaffe airfields in France. In July the twelve Blenheim squadrons of 2 Group lost 31 aircraft, along with three Wing Commanders. During the summer the light bomber force also supported defensive operations during the Battle of Britain, bombing German invasion barges concentrated in the Channel ports. As Bomber Command commenced on its nighttime bomber offensive against Germany 2 Group was set aside to engage in daylight raids on shipping, coastal ports and other heavily defended targets across the channel in Occupied Europe. At that stage of the war the Group‚Äôs Blenheims were near obsolete and sustaining heavy operational casualties. Nevertheless, operations continued unabated under Air Vice-Marshal D F Stevenson, a man who was infamous throughout the RAF at the time for his ruthless aggressiveness, his ambition and his lack of concern for the high loss rates suffered by his crews. Even Churchill was greatly disturbed by the loss rates on the attacks Stevenson was ordering his crews to fly. Upon his removal as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) in December 1941 his crews were greatly relieved.Hastings 2013, pp. 84‚Äì85. No. 2 Group carried out a low-level attack on Bremen on 2 July 1941 in which the leader, Wing Commander Hughie Edwards of No. 105 Squadron, won the Victoria Cross. 2 Group supported the ill-fated Dieppe Raid in August 1942. Mosquito Mk IV's also made the first daylight attack on Berlin. On 6 December 1942 James Pelly-Fry led 2 Group's Operation Oyster daylight raid on the Philips] electrical works at Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Eight of 2 Group's squadrons were committed to the raid, which was complicated by the need to use three different types of bomber aircraft to get an adequate bomb load to the target. The raid involved the use of de Havilland Mosquitos, Douglas Bostons and Lockheed Venturas. Losses to 2 Group were heavy, with 14 aircraft brought down by flak and enemy fighters, a 20% loss rate. Three more aircraft crash-landed on returning to England. Fifty-seven aircraft had been damaged and needed repairs. The raid was successful in devastating the Philips works, which did not return to production of radio tubes and other electronic equipment for six months. Casualties suffered by the Dutch workers and civilian population, though substantial, were significantly less than what would have occurred if the mission had been attempted by the heavy bombers in a massive night raid. At the end of May 1943 the Group left RAF Bomber Command to join the new Second Tactical Air Force, and came under Fighter Command control until the formation of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force five months later. 2 Group Mosquitos also made the famous wall-breaching operation against Amiens gaol in early 1944 which cost Group Captain Charles Pickard (of Target for Tonight film fame) his life. By the Normandy landings on D-day, No. 2 Group consisted of four wings of Douglas Bostons, North American B-25 Mitchells, and Mosquito light and medium bombers. During Operation Market Garden in September 1944 the Group included 136, 138, and 140 Wings, flying Mosquitos. and 137 & 139 Wings, flying the Mitchell. No. 2 Group flew just over 57,000 operational sorties at a cost of 2,671 men killed or missing and 396 wounded. It was disbanded on 1 May 1947 and reformed on 1 December 1948 within the British Air Force of Occupation. It was transferred again to Second Tactical Air Force on 1 September 1951. On 1 July 1956, No. 2 Group appeared to encompass wings at RAF Ahlhorn (No. 125 Wing RAF), RAF Fassberg (No. 121 Wing RAF), RAF Gutersloh (No. 551 Wing RAF, under the control of Bomber Command), Jever (No. 122 Wing RAF), RAF Laarbruch (No. 34 Wing RAF), RAF Oldenburg (No. 124 Wing RAF), and RAF Wunstorf (No. 123 Wing RAF). No. 2 Group was disbanded on 15 November 1958. It was reformed 1 April 1993 by renaming RAF Germany and was then disbanded on 1 April 1996 with absorption into No. 1 Group RAF. It was reformed on 7 January 2000 to take control of air transport, air-to-air refuelling and airborne early warning within the RAF. The AOC's two principal subordinates were Air Commodore AT/AAR & C3I (directing air transport, AAR, and C3I) and Air Commodore Royal Air Force Regiment & Survive to Operate. On 1 April 2006 it took over the responsibilities of No. 3 Group RAF, which was disbanded.

A talented keyboardist, he moved to the US West Coast where in the mid 1970s he joined Angel. After the band broke up in 1981 Giuffria put together his own band, Giuffria, with vocalist David Glen Eisley, guitarist Craig Goldy, bassist Chuck Wright, and drummer Alan Krigger, and achieved some success with their first eponymous album and first single \\"Call to the Heart,\\" which made the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band broke up after the commercial failure of their next album \\"Silk and Steel\\" in 1986. Giuffria then put together the House of Lords with the help of Kiss' Gene Simmons and signed to Simmons' label. The first album House of Lords, was released in 1988 and experienced a modest amount of commercial success with the single \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\". However, this success was not consolidated as the band were unwilling to tour.

WCVX is owned by the Christian Broadcasting System and it carries a Christian radio format. Its studios and offices are on West Seventh Street in Cincinnati and its transmitter is off Fowler Creek Road in Florence. WCVX broadcasts with a directional antenna with 5,000 watts in the daytime but at night it reduces power to 990 watts to protect KSL in Salt Lake City, the Class A Clear-channel station on 1160 kHz. WYLL in Chicago, Illinois is the only other full-time 50,000-watt station on 1160 AM, although it is a Class B station. Hosts heard on WCVX include Dr. Charles Stanley, Joyce Meyer and Jim Daly. History =Early years= At 1180 AM WCVX originally signed on in 1984 as WFKB 1180 AM, a 1,000-watt daytime-only station licensed to Florence, Kentucky. WFKB was required to sign off at sunset to protect WHAM in Rochester, New York which is the clear channel station on that frequency. WFKB was a full service station which served northern Kentucky, and offered news every hour along with Middle of the Road or MOR music. WFKB changed to a country music format by 1986, and was simulcast with WIOK-FM in Falmouth, Kentucky as an AM-FM combo. In 1987, WFKB was acquired by Amber Broadcasting. The format was changed to Adult standards or Nostalgia, and the call letters were changed to WMLX to reflect a former station in the media market that had done the same format. In 1989, WMLX was acquired by Hoker Broadcasting, which also owned then-WOFX-FM at 94.9 MHz. The two stations were affiliated until 1992, when WOFX-FM was sold to Heritage Media. WMLX was then a stand-alone station, and was purchased in 1993 by KLM Communications, which was headed by Dr. Kenneth L. McDowell. Move to 1160 In February 1993, WMLX was granted Special Temporary Authority by the FCC to move to 1160 AM and broadcast 24 hours per day at 1,000 watts daytime power and 500 watts at night. Call letters were changed in March 1993 to WBND, to reflect the station's new identity as \\"The Blend.\\" This format was an attempt to merge the very popular Nostalgia/Standards format with an Urban adult contemporary format, which had been KLM's original plan for the station. An early attempt at a Saturday sports talk show was hosted by Cincinnati basketball legend Oscar Robertson. A Sunday jazz show was hosted by local musician Wilbert Longmire. By 1995, WBND had been sold to the owners of WNKR- FM in Dry Ridge, Kentucky and the call letters changed to WKYN to reflect an emphasis towards northern Kentucky news and sports. The station's signal was eventually upgraded to 5000 watts daytime and 990 watts nighttime, with different directional patterns for day and night. From the station's new transmitter site near Union, Kentucky, WKYN was now directing more than 10,000 watts towards downtown Cincinnati during the day. At night, the power directed at Cincinnati was only 1,629 watts. The lower power, coupled with typical nighttime AM skywave interference, caused the post-sunset signal to be listenable in limited areas of the market, mainly northern Kentucky and the western side of Cincinnati. (WCVX still uses this transmitter site with the same signal parameters.) New owner, new format Despite the nighttime limitations, the station's new, more powerful signal caught the attention of Chancellor Media, which owned 1230 WUBE, 105.1 WUBE-FM and 96.5 WYGY in Cincinnati. In 1995, WUBE had begun running a sports-talk format known as \\"1230 The Score.\\" Programming consisted of nationally syndicated \\"Imus in the Morning\\" and \\"The Fabulous Sports Babe\\" as well as a local afternoon show, and network programming from One-On-One Sports in the evening and on weekends. Chancellor purchased WKYN in 1996 and moved \\"The Score\\" to the more powerful WKYN signal. While the new \\"Score\\" was much more powerful during the day, WKYN's nighttime signal was lacking (as noted above) in areas north of the Ohio River and east of downtown Cincinnati where WUBE had provided a strong signal. =WBOB= The home of the Bengals At the conclusion of the 1996 NFL season, WKYN stunned the local radio and sports communities by winning the rights to be the official home of the Cincinnati Bengals football team for three seasons. The games would also be simulcast on powerhouse sister station WUBE-FM, the city's dominant Country station. On Cincinnati Reds opening day in 1997, the station changed call letters to WBOB and became known as \\"1160 BOB.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-05-09.pdf The station eventually dropped syndicated programming during the day, and ran a live and local sports talk format from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM each weekday. There were also various live weekend shows. During this time, WUBE and WBOB became a sports combo, simulcasting some programs to make up for individual signal deficiencies. The stronger 1160 AM was known as \\"BOB\\", while 1230 AM was known as \\"BOB 2.\\" In 1999, WBOB's parent company - by then known as AMFM, Inc. - merged with Clear Channel Communications. Because Clear Channel already owned the maximum number of stations allowed in the Cincinnati market, WBOB was spun off to Salem Communications, along with sister station WYGY-FM (now WFTK and owned by Cumulus Media). WUBE (now WDBZ) was sold to Blue Chip Broadcasting, while WUBE-FM was sold to Infinity Broadcasting. Bengals play-by-play then shifted to competing all-sports station \\"1360 Homer\\" WCKY and \\"92.5 The Fox\\" WOFX-FM, both of which were owned by Clear Channel. In addition, WLW would also carry the games once the Reds season ended, giving the network three flagship stations. Most of the WBOB hosts also made the transition to WCKY at this time, which is still the arrangement, even though WCKY now broadcasts at 1530 AM. As of September 2008, the FM simulcast for Bengals games was moved to WEBN-FM 102.7. (WOFX-FM has since been sold to Cumulus Media.) The Salem years In August 2000, WBOB was officially acquired by Salem Communications. Salem kept WBOB's sports talk format, but changed the emphasis from local sports to an ESPN Radio format. There was a local show in the afternoon featuring WBOB Program Director Doug Kidd and reporter Gregg Waddell. This show would eventually be cancelled in favor of ESPN programming. A local midday program was introduced featuring WLWT-TV sportscaster Ken Broo and Waddell, but that show would also be short-lived. Another local program featured Cincinnati Business Courier columnist Andy Hemmer talking about the business of sports during his show, \\"The SportsTicker with Andy Hemmer.\\" In late 2003, Salem dropped ESPN from WBOB and flipped it to a talk radio format. It was programmed like most other Salem-owned talk stations, using the Salem Radio Network of talent such as Dennis Prager, Michael Medved, Hugh Hewitt, Bill Bennett and Mike Gallagher. In addition, other syndicated hosts aired on WBOB including Laura Ingraham and Bill O'Reilly. In February 2006, Salem sold WBOB to Christian Broadcasting System and exited the market altogether in exchange for a station in Detroit. At that time, Alchemy Broadcasting became the lease holder of WBOB and changed the format to Oldies and the call letters to WDJO. WDJO Flips to Oldies =WDJO= History of the WDJO call sign The WDJO call sign was previously used by another oldies station on 1230 AM from 1985 to 1990 in the Cincinnati area which is now urban talker WDBZ. The WDJO call sign was also used by 106.5 FM in Greenville, Ohio (Dayton market) when it aired a Jammin' Oldies format. That station is now WRZX. 1160 and 1230 connections The WMLX call letters and nostalgia format were originally on 1230 AM between 1981 and 1985. Those call letters and format would later appear in 1987 on 1180 AM, the predecessor to 1160 AM. The \\"Score\\" sports talk format was launched on 1230 AM in 1995, then moved to 1160 in 1996. The WDJO call letters and Oldies format originally appeared on 1230 AM between 1985 and 1990. Those call letters and format are currently on 1480 AM. John Nolan owns and operates WDJO 1480 AM. WDJO moves to AM 1480 On May 18, 2009, WDJO announced a move to 1480 AM, the former WCIN which previously aired a smooth jazz format. As part of the move, both 1160 and 1480 began simulcasting the transition asking listeners by way of on-air promotional announcements by Charlie Van Dyke and the station's website to switch to 1480. On May 23, 2009, WDJO began its new branding \\"Oldies 1480.\\" Until May 28, messages interrupted oldies music on the 1160 frequency, directing people to the 1480 frequency. Throughout May 28, a 30-minute infomercial for a dietary supplement was run over and over. On May 29, Christian programming and music began. On May 26, 2009, Christian Broadcasting System, LTD filed a request for the WQRT call letters for their Florence, Kentucky station on 1160 AM. On June 3, 2009, The Cincinnati Enquirer's John Kiesewetter reported that a conservative talk format featuring Laura Ingraham, Neil Boortz, Dave Ramsey and Dr. Laura Schlessinger would debut on 1160 AM on June 15, 2009. Coincidentally, 1160 AM was the original Cincinnati home of Laura Ingraham and Dave Ramsey when it was News/Talk WBOB in 2003.http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&U;=5c49394b12564ab6832411d82ad3a991&plckController;=PersonaBlog&plckScript;=personaScript&plckElementId;=personaDest&plckPersonaPage;=BlogViewPost&plckPostId;=Blog%3a5c49394b12564ab6832411d82ad3a991Post%3a9567badd- bcfa-4dd6-bed2-31e7f0aa9d34&sid;=sitelife.cincinnati.com WQRT Real Talk 1160 On June 15, 2009 the station's call letters changed to WQRT and a conservative talk format debuted. The station was briefly known as \\"Q-1160\\" and even registered a web address at www.q1160.com. After several hours on the air, the station's management realized that any use of the letter Q in the Cincinnati radio market was service marked by WKRQ 101.9 FM, which has been known as \\"Q102\\" for over 30 years. By the afternoon on June 15, the station had edited out the \\"Q-1160\\" reference in all imaging and had registered the new web domain www.realtalk1160.com. The station's primary image line was \\"Cincinnati's Real Talk 1160.\\" The station's lineup was primarily from the 24-hour satellite feed of Talk Radio Network, as part of TRN's initiative to distribute its programming in bulk. It was also the home of former WLW host Andy Furman, who was on in the morning and in late afternoon. As of December 13, 2010, WQRT cleared Dennis Miller, which replaced Dr. Laura, with the latter's move to Sirius XM Satellite Radio in 2011. WQRT is one of several stations that dropped the show early, before it ended terrestrial radio distribution. On Wednesday January 2, 2013, WQRT let go its local on-air staff, after Dean Miuccio finished his \\"Cincinnality\\" morning show. Syndicated programming replaced the local content, and the station went dark after the Notre Dame football game on Monday January 7. On February 1, the station began its Christian radio format and WCVX call letters from 1050 AM, which is now known as Urban Gospel WGRI.

A veteran of the U.S. Civil War, where he fought for the 12th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment against the Confederates in Louisiana. After the war, he was hired by the Japanese government as a foreign adviser to assist in the modernization of the Japanese education system after the Meiji Restoration. He served as a professor of English at Kaisei Gakko, the forerunner of Tokyo Imperial University. In either 1872 or 1873, Wilson decided that his students needed more physical exercise, and introduced them to the sport of baseball. Several weeks or months later, enough interest had developed for the school to sponsor a seven-inning game between the Japanese students and foreign instructors. The first formal baseball team was established in 1878. Wilson returned to the United States in 1877 and lived in San Francisco. He died in 1927 at age 84.

McCourt Jr. (born August 14, 1953) is an American businessman, chairman of McCourt LP, chairman and CEO of McCourt Global, and current owner of the Los Angeles Marathon and football club Olympique de Marseille. He was the owner and chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Dodger Stadium from 2004 to 2012. In 2004, he purchased a controlling interest of the Dodgers from Fox Entertainment Group, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Prior to purchasing the Dodgers and moving to Los Angeles, McCourt was a Boston real estate developer, whose family resided in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 2013, he donated $100 million to establish the McCourt School of Public Policy, the ninth school of Georgetown University. On August 29, 2016, Margarita Louis- Dreyfus, who was the owner of the French Ligue 1 club, Olympique de Marseille and the Marseille mayor, Jean-Claude Gaudin, stated during a press conference with McCourt that McCourt had agreed to purchase Olympique de Marseille. The deal was completed in Paris on October 17, 2016. Early years and business background McCourt was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised as a Catholic and attended Georgetown University, where he earned an economics degree in 1975. He met his future wife, Jamie Luskin, when they were both freshmen at Georgetown. They married in 1979. The McCourt family has a long association with real estate and construction in the Boston area. In 1977, McCourt founded The McCourt Company, which specializes in the development of major commercial real estate projects, particularly parking lots. In the late 1970s McCourt acquired in South Boston from the bankrupt Penn Central railroad and developed the L-shaped property into parking lots. The McCourt company headquarters moved to Los Angeles in 2004 in connection with the family relocating to Los Angeles. The McCourts owned a $16 million, home in Brookline, Massachusetts, that was acquired by John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox. Failed Red Sox bid Before buying the Los Angeles Dodgers, McCourt made a bid to buy his hometown Boston Red Sox. If he had won the bid, he had planned to build a new stadium on the land he owned and used for parking lots on the South Boston waterfront. Instead, the Red Sox were sold in 2002 to John W. Henry, Tom Werner and Red Sox President Larry Lucchino. McCourt is not the first member of this family to own part or whole of a sports franchise. His grandfather was part-owner of the Boston Braves. Los Angeles Dodgers =Purchase of the L.A. Dodgers= After his failed bid to buy the Red Sox, he turned his attention to the Dodgers. In 2004, McCourt bought the Los Angeles Dodgers for US$430 million from NewsCorp, Rupert Murdoch's flagship enterprise. McCourt's purchase of the Dodgers was financed mostly by debt. In 2004 McCourt's South Boston parking lot property was used as collateral for some of the financing to acquire the Dodgers from NewsCorp. Later the South Boston property was turned over to NewsCorp in exchange for canceling acquisition debt. NewsCorp received approximately $200 million when they re-sold the property to Morgan Stanley and Boston real estate investor John B. Hynes III in 2006. The Dodgers assets acquired by McCourt included significant real estate assets related to the stadium in Chavez Ravine, including stadium parking lot land. Plans have been announced for new real estate developments at Dodger Stadium. To offset the purchase, McCourt raised ticket and concession prices every year. By April 2009 the team and its related assets, in which McCourt had invested heavily in improvements, had increased in value to $722 million according to Forbes. In 2010 the value of the team was estimated at $727 million according to Forbes. =Hiring and firing of Paul DePodesta= In 2003 (under NewsCorp ownership) the Dodgers' record was 85 wins, 77 losses. Shortly after purchasing the team, McCourt fired then General Manager Dan Evans, replacing him with Paul DePodesta. DePodesta is featured (along with Billy Beane) in the book Moneyball as it discussed their sabermetric-based approach to using statistics to build the Oakland A's. In Los Angeles, DePodesta made a trade in the middle of the 2004 season that sent the Dodgers' starting catcher, Paul Lo Duca, its set-up man, pitcher Guillermo Mota, and outfielder Juan Encarnaci√≥n to the Florida Marlins for the high on-base percentage first baseman Hee-Seop Choi and power pitcher Brad Penny and pitching prospect Bill Murphy, who was in turn flipped with Koyie Hill and Reggie Abercrombie to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Gold Glove center fielder Steve Finley and catcher Brent Mayne. At the time, DePodesta said of Choi, \\"I think we've acquired one of the better offensive players in the league.\\" Finley hit 13 HRs for the Dodgers in his two months with the team. Choi batted .161 with 0 HRs for the Dodgers after the trade, though he walked 11 times in 87 plate appearances. In the playoff loss to St. Louis that season, Penny did not play, Choi had one at bat (hitless) and Dodger catchers were 3-for-10. In 2004, the Dodgers won the NL West with a record of 93-69, but lost in four games to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Divisional Series. In the offseason the Dodgers decided not to re-sign Adri√°n Beltr√© due to his high contract demands (Beltre finished second in the NL MVP voting and would later sign with Seattle for 5 years/$64 million). DePodesta signed outfielder J. D. Drew for five years at $55 million, sinkerball pitcher Derek Lowe for four years at $36 million,http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/la/news/la_news.jsp?ymd=20050112&content;_id=930538&vkey;=news_la&fext;=.jsp and All-Star second baseman Jeff Kent. However, the 2005 season, with a record of 71‚Äî91, was the Dodgers' second-worst record since moving to Los Angeles, due in part to players' injuries. That off-season, manager Jim Tracy was fired. Soon after Tracy was fired, McCourt fired DePodesta and about a month later, hired Ned Colletti to replace him. =Ned Colletti/Joe Torre era= Ned Colletti's first action as GM was the signing of the former Red Sox manager, Grady Little. Colletti then signed several veteran players such as Rafael Furcal, Nomar Garciaparra, Kenny Lofton, and Bill Mueller. These players were among those who led the 2006 Dodgers to the NL Wild Card spot, with an 88‚Äì74 record. The Dodgers were swept by the New York Mets in the National League Division Series. In the winter of 2006‚Äì07 the team signed Juan Pierre, Jason Schmidt, and Luis Gonzalez. In October 2007, Grady Little resigned and Joe Torre was hired as their new manager. In 2008 with Torre, Ned Colletti signed Andruw Jones, Hiroki Kuroda, and Chan Ho Park. During the trade deadline the Dodgers acquired Manny Ramirez in a trade with the Boston Red Sox. In 2007 Dr. Charles Steinberg was hired as executive vice president, marketing and public relations, of the Dodgers after working with the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles. In 2009, he was reported to be on his way out and was said to be allied with Jamie McCourt and had lost influence as she did, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times. =Dodgers' Dream Foundation= In 2010, it was revealed that then California Attorney General Jerry Brown was opening an investigation into the Dodgers' charitable foundation, the Dodgers' Dream Foundation. According to tax returns, the charity's chief executive, Howard Sunkin, earned a salary of nearly $400,000 per year, almost a quarter of the foundation's entire budget. Sunkin is a close associate of McCourt and has worked with him during his divorce proceedings. The courts eventually awarded the funds to be repaid, and McCourt personally repaid $100,000.Dodgers owner Frank McCourt repaid funds to a team charity =Divorce proceedings= On October 14, 2009, it was announced the McCourts would be separating after nearly 30 years of marriage. While speculation was raised on the impact upon the McCourt family and Dodger ownership, a spokesperson for Jamie McCourt said the following day that \\"the focus of the Dodgers is on the playoffs and the World Series.\\" Jamie was fired from her position as Dodgers CEO on Thursday, October 22, 2009, the day after the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs. She officially filed for divorce shortly thereafter. He has claimed that the divorce has \\"no bearing on the team whatsoever.\\" On December 7, 2010, the judge in the divorce case of the McCourts invalidated the post-nuptial marital property agreement (\\"MPA\\") that Frank McCourt had claimed provided him with sole ownership of the Dodgers. In the wake of this decision, Frank McCourt's lawyers said that Frank would use other legal avenues to establish his sole ownership of the Dodgers, while Jamie McCourt's lawyers said that Jamie would be confirmed as the co-owner of the team as community property of their marriage. \\"Dodgers in limbo after judge throws out McCourt property agreement\\" L.A. Times, December 7, 2010, by Bill Shaikin and Carla Hall On June 17, 2011, the McCourts reached agreement on a settlement of their divorce. The settlement was contingent upon Major League Baseball approving a 17-year television contract between the Dodgers and FOX Television. The discussion set aside the Dodgers' ownership issue until a scheduled one-day trial on August 4, whereupon if the judge sided with Frank he would keep the team and pay a settlement fee to Jamie and if the judge sided with her the team would be sold.McCourts reach divorce settlement However, on June 20, baseball rejected the television deal and the settlement agreement fell apart.Commish: TV deal not in Dodgers' best interests On October 17, 2011, the McCourts reached a settlement in their divorce case whereby Jamie would receive about $130 million and relinquish her claim on the Dodgers.

His statement said that he took that action because of his \\"deep concerns for the finances and operations\\" of the Dodgers.Bud Selig says MLB will run Dodgers This event occurred shortly after an LA Times report that McCourt had obtained a personal loan from Fox to cover the team's payroll for April and May. McCourt vigorously disputed MLB's actions. Nevertheless, Selig appointed former diplomat and former Texas Rangers executive Tom Schieffer to oversee the Dodgers' finances. On June 27, the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. After much legal wrangling between McCourt's lawyers and MLB lawyers in bankruptcy court, he reached a deal with the league to put the team up for sale.Frank McCourt agrees to sell Dodgers On March 27, 2012, he agreed to sell the team to a group consisting of former L.A. Laker Magic Johnson, former baseball executive Stan Kasten and the Guggenheim Partners for a record price of $2 billion, the highest ever for a professional sports team. McCourt separately sold the land surrounding the stadium for $150 million to the same group, while maintaining some economic interest in the property. According to the Guggenheim Group, McCourt will have no control or influence over the land, but will profit from potential future development of it. Also, the new ownership will pay $14 million to rent the parking lots surrounding Dodger Stadium from an entity half-owned by McCourt. The sale officially closed on May 1, 2012, ending McCourt's turbulent period as Dodgers owner.Dodgers sale closes; McCourt era ends Los Angeles Marathon In 2008, McCourt bought the operating rights to the Los Angeles Marathon.Frank McCourt buys the rights to the LA Marathon McCourt's group changed the route of the Marathon so that it would start at Dodger Stadium.

The station airs a talk radio format and is owned by Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting Corporation. Weekdays begin with a local news and information show, followed by mostly syndicated programming, including shows from Laura Ingraham, Michael Savage, Dennis Prager, Eric Metaxas, Jay Sekulow and Red Eye Radio. Most hours begin with Townhall News. Some hours are paid brokered programming. The station calls itself \\"AM 600 & FM 101.1 The Answer,\\" a slogan often used on Salem Radio Network talk stations. By day, WBOB is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum power permitted for commercial AM stations by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). But at night, to protect other stations on AM 600, it reduces power to 9,700 watts. A directional antenna, located off Lenox Avenue in Jacksonville, is used at all times.Radio- Locator.com/WBOB Listeners in Jacksonville and adjacent communities can also hear WBOB on FM translator station W266CX at 101.1 in Fruit Cove, Florida. History =Early years= On December 9, 1933, the station signed on as WMBR, at 1270 kilocycles.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 28 It was owned by the Florida Broadcasting Company and was powered at only 100 watts. In the 1940s, WMBR moved first to 1400 khz, powered at 250 watts. It would then move to 1460 kHz and increased its power to 5,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 112 WMBR was a CBS Radio Network affiliate and carried its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio. In 1948, it added an FM station, WMBR-FM (now WEJZ), and in 1949, it put a TV station on the air, WMBR-TV (now WJXT). WMBR-TV was the first TV station in Jacksonville and carried programming from all the major networks initially. Meanwhile, in 1942, another AM station went on the air in Jacksonville, WJDC at 1270 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1942 page 116 It was owned by the Jacksonville Broadcasting Company and was powered at 5,000 watts. In a few years, it had moved to 600 kHz. It changed its call sign to WPDQ and was an ABC affiliate. Henderson Belk, a North Carolina businessman, purchased WPDQ in 1964 from Brush-Moore Newspapers.WPDQ Jacksonville sold for $750,000, Broadcasting, Volume 66, pp. 9, 96 (May 18, 1964) =Moving to AM 600= In the 1960s and early 1970s, WPDQ carried a Top 40 format, while WMBR stayed with its full service middle of the road (MOR) format. In 1975, after Belk sold the station to Robert Rounsaville of Atlanta,Jacksonville stations undergo four-way juggle, Television/Radio Age, Volume 23, p.11 (1975) the two stations made a switch. WMBR took the better frequency at 600 kHz, describing its format as \\"Bright MOR Personality.\\" WPDQ moved higher up the dial to WMBR's old frequency, 1460 kHz, continuing its Top 40 sound.Broadcasting Yearbook 1976 page C-39 In 1977, AM 600 switched its call letters to WSNY, calling itself \\"Sunny 60,\\" although the format remained Bright MOR Personality. Then, in 1980, the call letters were changed to WAIV. AM 600 began simulcasting Top 40 programming from its FM sister station WAIV-FM, known as ‚ÄúThe Big Wave.‚Äù =From Country to Talk= Pop Country became the new format in 1981 with a call letter change to WOKV, known as \\"OK 60 The Unrock.\\" Music continued on WOKV with various adjustments from pop country to adult contemporary to oldies. In 1986, the station was bought by EZ Communications.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-67 AM 600 would flip to a news/talk format, and was Jacksonville's original home of the syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show. In 1994, Prism Radio Partners acquired the former WAPE/690, \\"The Big Ape.\\" WAPE had Jacksonville's best AM signal, powered at 50,000 watts by day non-directional, 10,000 watts at night with a directional signal. The WOKV callsign and news/talk programming was moved to 690 AM. The WPDQ callsign was again returned to AM 600 with an adult standards format. =Sports and Children's Programming= In 1996, Prism changed the AM 600 call letters again, this time to WBWL. The station became known as \\"The Ball\\" with a format change to sports radio. Cox Radio purchased the station in 1999, and in 2001, WBWL was sold to The Walt Disney Company with a format change to Radio Disney programming. =WBOB Talk= Children's radio programming lasted until December 2010, when Radio Disney sold WBWL to Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting Corporation. The call letters were changed to WBOB with a conservative talk format. It featured Bill Bennett's Morning in America, Laura Ingraham and Glenn Beck along with a variety of local news and talk programming. As of the 2014 season, WBOB broadcasts games from the Jacksonville Sharks Arena Football League. Also in the mid-2010s, WBOB got a power boost, going from 5,000 watts day and night, to 50,000 watts in the daytime and 9,700 watts at night.

In the episode, Bebe Stevens's breasts begin to develop, and the boys are suddenly drawn to her even though they had no interest in her before. The episode focuses on and satirizes men's fascination over women's breasts.  Plot  The children return to school for the first time since the death of Ms. Choksondik in the episode \\"Simpsons Already Did It\\". During the break, Bebe (Wendy's best friend) has started to develop breasts. Though they are small (she at first thought they were mosquito bites), they prompt all the boys in town to begin to think that she is unusually smart and cool, without even understanding why. However, this causes Wendy and the other girls to get incredibly jealous, especially since Stan, Wendy's boyfriend (who hasn't asked Wendy to hang out with Stan and the other boys), is one of the boys affected. The girls begin making up malicious rumors about Bebe and accuse her of being sexually promiscuous. Consequently, the boys begin to fight and bicker about who gets to play with Bebe, sound effects from Cannibal Holocaust play as the boys fight like the primitive men from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes. Throughout the episode Cartman plays a game he calls 'Lambs', which involves placing one of his dolls in a pit in his basement and torturing it, saying, \\"It puts the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.\\", as a reference to Silence of the Lambs. Eventually, the boys get into a fight and seem to permanently turn into cavemen. Meanwhile, Bebe, worried that boys might never take her seriously (as happened to her mother, a stereotypical dumb blonde), consults a plastic surgeon about breast reduction surgery; however, he rejects the proposition because he considers breast reduction \\"insane\\" (which is made apparent especially after giving contrasting personalities to two female colleagues: one with large breasts, and the other flat-chested). He then tells her that if she wants them bigger, \\"now might be the time to size up\\"; Bebe leaves his office in frustration and disgust. Similarly when Wendy asks for a breast implant he accepts her request, but only after she announces she has three thousand dollars in cash, despite her mother's protest that she is too young. Meanwhile, Stan draws pictures of breasts on the wall of his house referring to his work and breasts as \\"Ah-tah,\\" an apparent reference to the film Quest for Fire, wherein prehistoric man refers to fire as \\"Atar.\\" Stan's father, Randy, has a talk with him about his breast-obsession, going along with Stan's calling breasts \\"Ah-tahs\\", and describes all women have breasts: \\"And one day you'll meet a pair of boobs you want to marry.\\" This eventually convinces Stan to snap out of his caveman-like trance. After this scene, Bebe is shown in bed, with her breasts glowing and speaking to each other, plotting to rule the world by taking over the boys' minds. Bebe awakens and screams, her mother quickly runs into the room to ask her what is happening, she explains what she heard and her mother calmly replies that it is only natural for a growing woman to have boobs that plot to take over boys minds. This is where Bebe snaps, claiming she does not want boobs that are going to try to rule the world, and begins to come up with a plan to fix this problem. The next time they are seen, at school, Bebe walks in wearing a box over her chest, which causes all the boys to suddenly break out of their trance; Stan shares his father's advice not to let breasts control their lives, and the boys all agree that it is for the best. Consequently, when Wendy shows up with her new breast implants, she is ridiculed rather than praised. Butters goes up and pokes them, saying that they are all \\"hard and oogy,\\" to which Cartman replies \\"What a stupid bitch!\\" Production In the DVD commentary, Parker describes the inspiration for the show came from a party where two of his friends were drunk and trying to hit on a girl. One of the guys starts stroking the girls hair, when the other guy reached to stroke the girls hair too, the first guy started making guttural gorilla noises. Stone describes how South Park takes the view that society is the only thing that keeps people from descending into savages. On syndicated broadcasts, the scene where Wendy is in surgery getting breast implants is cut. The episode has been used to examine the treatment of female characters in South Park.Ted Gournelos, Blasphemous Allusion: Coming of Age in South Park, Journal of Communication Inquiry , Vol 33, Issue 2, pp. 143 - 168 (December 17, 2008)Khodasevich, Vera.

It was established for the purpose of exploitation, terror, and persecution of local Polish Jews. The ghetto was later used as a staging area for separating the \\"able workers\\" from those to be deported to extermination camps in Operation Reinhard in Krak√≥w. The Ghetto was liquidated between June 1942 and March 1943, with most of its inhabitants deported to the Belzec extermination camp as well as to P≈Çasz√≥w slave-labor camp, and Auschwitz concentration camp, rail distance.  Background  Before the German-Soviet invasion of 1939, Krak√≥w was an influential centre for the Polish Jews who had lived there since the 13th century. Persecution of the Jewish population of Krak√≥w began immediately after the German troops entered the city on 6 September 1939 in the course of the German aggression against Poland. Jews were ordered to report for forced labour beginning in September 1939. In November, all Jews twelve years or older were required to wear identifying armbands. Throughout Krak√≥w, synagogues were closed and all their relics and valuables confiscated by the Nazi authorities.\\"Getto krakowskie.\\" About Krak√≥w Ghetto, with valuable historical photos and the Ghetto map. DWS. ISSN 2082-7431 Krak√≥w was made the capital of the General Government (the part of occupied Poland not directly incorporated into Germany), and by May 1940 the German occupation authority headed by the Governor-General Hans Frank announced that Krak√≥w should become the ‚Äúracially cleanest\\" city in the General Government. Massive deportations of Jews from the city ensued. Of the more than 68,000 Jews in Krak√≥w at the time of the German invasion, only 15,000 workers and their families were permitted to remain. All other Jews were ordered out of the city, to be resettled into surrounding rural areas of the General Government.  Formation of the Krak√≥w Ghetto  In April 1940, Hans Frank proposed the removal of 50,000 Jews from the city of Krak√≥w. Frank's reasoning for removing Jews from the Jewish quarter was that the area \\"...will be cleansed and it will be possible to establish pure German neighborhoods...\\" within Krak√≥w. From May 1940 to 15 August 1940, a voluntary expulsion program was enacted. Jews that chose to leave Krak√≥w were allowed to take all of their belongings and relocate throughout the General-Government (Generalgouvernement). By 15 August 1940, 23,000 Jews had left Krak√≥w. After this date, mandatory expulsions were enforced. On 25 November 1940, the Order for the Deportation of Jews from the Municipal District of Krak√≥w was announced. This order declared that no more Jews were allowed into the city of Krak√≥w, Jews residing in Krak√≥w required a special permit, and locations outside of Krak√≥w that Jews were forced to move to were chosen by authorities. Jews forced to leave were also only allowed to bring along 25 kg (62¬Ω lbs.) of their belongings when they left. By 4 December 1940, 43,000 Jews were removed from Krak√≥w, both voluntarily and involuntarily. Jews that were still residing in Krak√≥w at this time were deemed \\"...economically useful...\\" and they had to obtain a residence permit that \\"...had to be renewed each month.\\" The following year, on 3 March 1941, the establishment of the Krak√≥w Ghetto was ordered by Otto W√§chter. The ghetto was to be set up in the Podg√≥rze District of Krak√≥w. Podg√≥rze was chosen as the site of the ghetto instead of the traditional Jewish quarter, Kazimierz, because Hans Frank believed Kazimierz was more significant to the history of Krak√≥w. Podg√≥rze was a suburb of Krak√≥w at the time. W√§chter claimed that formation of the ghetto was necessary for public health and order. The Krak√≥w ghetto was officially established on 20 March 1941. When relocating to the ghetto, Jews were only allowed to bring 25 kg of their belongings. The rest of their possessions were taken by the German Trust Office (Treuhandstelle). Some Jews were resettled to the nearby ghetto of Brzesko. All non-Jewish residents of the area were required to relocate in other districts by 20 March 1941. The ghetto was guarded by the German police (Schutzpolizei), the Polish police (Blue Police), and the Jewish police (J√ºdischer Ordnungsdienst ‚Äì OD), but the only police force inside the ghetto was the Jewish police. With the formation of the ghetto, the OD had an office established at J√≥zefi≈Ñska Street 37 in Podg√≥rze. In April 1941, the ghetto was enclosed by a wall made of barbed wire and stone; the stones used were designed to look like tombstones, but also included \\"...Jewish monuments and tombstones from the cemetery.\\" The ghetto wall was constructed using Jewish forced labor. The ghetto was accessible by three entrances: one near the Podg√≥rze Market, Limanowskiego Street, and the Plac Zgody. The Krak√≥w Ghetto was a closed ghetto meaning that it was physically closed off from the surrounding area and access was restricted. Within other German-occupied areas, open ghettos and destruction ghettos existed. Movement in and out of the ghetto was restricted and Jews working outside of the ghetto had to have the proper documentation. Jews had to \\"...obtain the appropriate stamps for the Kennkarten [identification cards]...\\" from the Labor Office (Arbeitsamt). The ghetto was populated by approximately 16,000 Jews when it was first formed. Before the ghetto was cordoned off, it was home to around 3,500 residents. The ghetto consisted of 320 buildings. To accommodate the density, apartments within the ghetto were divided on a 2m¬≤ per person basis or by a standard of three people to one window. The Jewish Council (Judenrat) was responsible for determining the new housing assignments. Within the Krak√≥w ghetto, Yiddish was the official language, not Polish. On 1 December 1939, an order was announced mandating that all Jews within the General Government wear an armband identifying them as Jewish. The white armbands with the blue Star of David were still required once Jews were moved into the ghetto. On 15 October 1941, the Third Decree of the General Governor's was enacted. This decree stated that Jews found outside \\"...their designated residential area will be punished with death.\\" The punishment also applied to anyone found aiding Jews. The decree applied to all residents within the General Government. On 28 November 1941, the area that encompassed the ghetto was reduced. The population of the Krak√≥w Ghetto increased because Nazis required the Jewish residents of 29 nearby villages to move to the ghetto. The size of the ghetto was reduced again in June 1942. The reductions in the size of the ghetto were associated with the deportation of Jews, including deportations to the Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp. When apartments that were no longer included in the ghetto were vacated, possessions were stolen and the units were reassigned. The Municipal Housing Office was responsible for these apartments. In December 1942. the Krak√≥w ghetto was divided into two parts: Ghetto \\"A\\" and Ghetto \\"B.\\" Ghetto \\"A\\" was intended for people that were working and Ghetto \\"B\\" was for everyone else. This division was planned with future liquidations of the ghetto in mind. Ghetto history The Krak√≥w Ghetto was formally established on 3 March 1941 in the Podg√≥rze district and not, as often believed, in the historic Jewish district of Kazimierz. Displaced Polish families from Podg√≥rze took up residences in the former Jewish dwellings outside the newly established Ghetto. Meanwhile, 15,000 Jews were crammed into an area previously inhabited by 3,000 people who used to live in a district consisting of 30 streets, 320 residential buildings, and 3,167 rooms. As a result, one apartment was allocated to every four Jewish families, and many less fortunate lived on the street. The Ghetto was surrounded by the newly built walls that kept it separated from the rest of the city. In a grim foreshadowing of the near future, these walls contained brick panels in the shape of tombstones. All windows and doors that opened onto the \\"Aryan\\" side were ordered to be bricked up. Only four guarded entrances allowed traffic to pass in or out. Small sections of the wall still remain today, one part is fitted with a memorial plaque, which reads \\"Here they lived, suffered and perished at the hands of Hitler's executioners. From here they began their final journey to the death camps.\\" Young people of the Akiva youth movement, who had undertaken the publication of an underground newsletter, HeHaluc HaLohem (\\"The Fighting Pioneer\\"), joined forces with other Zionists to form a local branch of the Jewish Fighting Organization (≈ªOB, Polish: ≈ªydowska Organizacja Bojowa), and organize resistance in the ghetto, supported by the Polish underground Armia Krajowa. The group carried out a variety of resistance activities including the bombing of the Cyganeria cafe ‚Äì a gathering place of Nazi officers. Unlike in Warsaw, their efforts did not lead to a general uprising before the ghetto was liquidated. From 30 May 1942 onward, the Nazis began systematic deportations from the Ghetto to surrounding concentration camps. Thousands of Jews were transported in the succeeding months as part of the Aktion Krakau headed by SS-Oberf√ºhrer Julian Scherner. Jews were assembled on Zgody Square first and then escorted to the railway station in Prokocim. The first transport consisted of 7,000 people, the second, of additional 4,000 Jews deported to Be≈Ç≈ºec death camp on 5 June 1942. On 13‚Äì14 March 1943, the final 'liquidation' of the ghetto was carried out under the command of SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Amon G√∂th. Two thousand Jews deemed able to work were transported to the P≈Çasz√≥w labor camp. Those deemed unfit for work ‚Äì some 2,000 Jews ‚Äì were killed in the streets of the ghetto on those days with the use of \\"Trawniki men\\" police auxiliaries. The remaining 3,000 were sent to Auschwitz.JewishKrakow.net ‚Äì A page on the Krakow Ghetto complete with contemporary picture gallery at the JewishKrakow.net. Accessed 12 March 2011  Jewish Council (Judenrat) of the Krak√≥w Ghetto  A 24-person Jewish board was formed in the city of Krak√≥w and later in the Krakow Ghetto, when the ghetto was formed on March 3, 1941. This Jewish Council was in charge of the inhabitants of the ghetto but received many orders from local Nazi officials, even though it retained some degree of autonomy. Some of its functions included overseeing labor and welfare, conducting a census and taxing the population.Trunk, Isaiah (1972). Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation.

Each day dragged on, consistently becoming harder and harder to tolerate and survive. There was not much for the Jewish individuals to live for. The mood was somber, spirits were low, and the majority of the ghetto's inhabitants remained hopeless. Jewish individuals in the Krak√≥w ghetto were required to wear a Star of David on their arm, identifying them as being Jewish, which led to the revoking of most rights. A curfew was implemented that stripped Jews of many opportunities to participate in the cultural life. As time went on, Jews needed to obtain permits in order to enter and exit the ghetto, robbing them of any freedom they felt they had left at this point. Even though the Jewish individuals were unable to participate in certain areas of cultural life in the Krak√≥w ghetto, ‚Äúvarious cultural and religious activities continued within the ghetto.\\" Although the practice of religion was banned, that did not stop the individuals in the Krak√≥w ghetto from praying and staying true to Judaism. At least three synagogues or other religious facilities were still in use that served as a place for the Jews to go to and pray. There was also a caf√© where artists played live music within the ghetto, which proved to be instrumental in keeping Jewish individuals' spirits up. Finally, there was a ghetto pharmacy, which was a place where people could go to discuss problems, read underground and official newspapers and learn the realities of what was happening and what atrocities they were living through. Numerous songs were created by individuals living the ghetto, serving three major purposes: ‚Äúdocumentation of ghetto life, a diversion from reality, and the upholding of tradition.‚Äù These songs portrayed their immense suffering coupled with their dedication and determination to survive. Some of the most popular lyrics are ‚ÄúMe hot zey in dr‚Äôerd, me vet zey iberlebn, me vet noch derlebn‚Äù (‚ÄúTo hell with them, we will survive them, we will yet survive‚Äù), conveying and sharing the feelings of the Jewish people through music. Laughter, which was a rarity in the Krak√≥w ghetto, was another way numerous victims attempted to cope with their strong hatred for the enemy. Sometimes individuals performed ghetto songs, while other times small groups performed them with various instruments. Street songs are a sub-genre of ghetto music with four dominant themes: hunger, corrupt administration, hope for freedom and a call for revolt. Music has always been a traditional and important aspect of both Jewish holidays and Jewish home life more generally. The individuals in the Krak√≥w Ghetto did their best to keep this tradition alive, especially during Passover and Yom Kippur. Although music brought some comfort to many individuals, suicide rates were significantly higher among the musicians than other camp workers. Many of the musicians were forced to watch the murder of their families and friends due to the Nazi's insistence that the prisoner-musicians play music while the other prisoners were marched to the gas chambers. Aleksander Kulisiewicz was an aspiring musician who did his best to ‚Äúcollect, compose, and perform songs‚Äù while living in the ghetto even though it was illegal to do so. Individuals in the Krak√≥w ghetto worked 12-hour days that left them more exhausted than imaginable. In order to pass the time, songs were sung throughout the work day. Mordechai Gebirtig, who is ‚Äúknown for his beautiful and prescient songs and poems‚Äù in Yiddish emerged from the Krak√≥w ghetto. His song ‚ÄúOur Town Is Burning‚Äù which was written in 1938 became ‚Äúone of the most popular songs in the ghettos and concentration camps.\\" Unfortunately, Gebirtig was shot and killed in the Krak√≥w ghetto. Another individual who was in the Krak√≥w ghetto was Roman Polanski, who became a famous film director upon his survival of the Holocaust. Polanski eventually directed a film that told the story of the musician W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman who survived the Holocaust. In order to pass time while trapped in these horrendous conditions, a lot of Jewish children in the Krak√≥w ghetto played the violin and any other instruments they had access to. Music proved to be an instrumental aspect of cultural life in the Krak√≥w ghetto that aided in keeping the spirits of Jewish individuals up as much as possible during such low and awful times.  Resistance  = Organized resistance = The Krak√≥w Jewish underground resistance existed from 1942 to late 1943, and stemmed from youth groups such as Akiva. The two groups that formed were Iskra and Hahalutz Halochem, or the Fighting Organization of the Jewish youth. Despite ultimately focusing on more classical armed resistance actions, they originally focused on providing support for education and welfare organizations within the ghetto. Eventually establishing a magazine, the groups initially focused on working with the Polish Underground and the Communist Partia Robotnicza (PPR). They ultimately planned for action against the Nazis. The Resistance conducted demonstrations against several Nazi- frequented institutions, including caf√© Cyganeria, caf√© Esplanada, and a theater. Additionally, the Polish Underground group also aided the Jews with a program called ≈ªegota. Initially, rather than aligning with either communist or Zionist groups, the Iskra Resistance group aimed solely at combating and destroying the Nazis. From the outset, Iskra's inaugural members were Heszek Bauminger, Shlomo Sh., and eventually Gola Mire. Heszek Bauminger fought for the Polish army at the beginning of the war, and despite participating in the Social Zionist Hashomer Hatzair group, he moved his allegiances to communism. Gola Mire ‚Äì another Hatzair former member ‚Äì became involved in the Polish Communist Party. Accordingly, Iskra worked in conjunction with the communist Polish Workers' Party division ‚Äì Gwardia Ludowa ‚Äì in an armed initiative. Specifically, German armed forces were the target of Iskra. Further, Resistance in the Krak√≥w ghetto decided to attack the ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù portion of the city rather than fight a futile war from within. To strengthen itself, Iskra merged with Hahalutz Halochem ‚Äì thus mixing communist leanings with a Zionist groupand subsequently forming the Jewish fighting Organization (Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa; ZOB)Despite the similarity in name this ZOB was independent from the ZOB involved in Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Historians will argue that the youth movements involved had significant, but realistic aims. It is suggested that Nazi intentions were evident to the youth and they consequently decided to fight the Nazis vision, even though they knew success would be limited. Significantly, composed of members of the Akiva Zionist youth movement, Hahalutz Halochem worked with Iskra along with communist to stage the Cyganeria bombing. Aligning with Hahalutz Halochem motivated Akiva to transition to armed resistance. Furthermore, the underground movements published a paper called ‚ÄúHechalutz Halochem‚Äù which was edited by Simon Dranger. This paper served to combat the German work of ‚ÄúZydowska Gazeta‚Äù; this was an underground work which attempted to conceal the Nazis' genocidal aims and thus stem any opposition. = Cyganeria Bombing = The Cyganeria Bombing is one of the more discussed attacks conducted by the Krak√≥w Resistance movements. It was one of a series of attacks in a retaliatory response to the implementation of mass deportations. Prior to Cyganeria, attacks occurred at the Optima factory and the Cosmo Club ‚Äì the Cosmo Club attack killed several Nazi elites. Furthermore, three attacks were planned for Dec. 24, 1942: Cyganeria Caf√©, Esplanada Caf√©, Sztuka theater, and an officers‚Äô club. Ultimately, the Hahalutz Halochem and Iskra resistance groups bombed Cyganeria on December 22 and killed from 7 to 70 Germans and injured many others. The attack at the theater was relatively unsuccessful due to poor planning and a refusal to harm innocent Poles in attendance; however, Esplanada Caf√© and the Officers‚Äô club attacks were successful. The relative success of the Resistance groups was hindered by Julek Appel and Natek Waisman who betrayed the resistance. Hahalutz Halochem was quickly subdued by the Nazis ‚Äì due to Appel and Waisman ‚Äì but better security habits protected Iskra for a limited time. Additionally, two key resistance members ‚Äì Adolf Liebeskind and Tennenbaum ‚Äì died in the attack. Finally, following the Cyganeria Caf√© attack, weapons, various currencies, and enemy uniforms were found by the Gestapo. The gestapo sent a message to Nazi elites via SS- Obergruppenf√ºher Wolff and Reichsf√ºher Himmler. Lucien Steinberg, the author of Jews Against Hitler, argues that this communicates the attack's significance to Hitler. Publicly the identity of the attacks perpetrators were not revealed and it was rumored to be the Polish Underground or the Soviets. Regarding the Jews who carried out the attack, they were disguised as Poles. This reflected a concern, within Hahalutz Halochem, of Nazi retaliation against the ghetto if the Jews were implicated. = Religious resistance = Additionally, Jews in the Krak√≥w Ghetto participated in a form of religious resistance by continuing to practice Judaism in secret. This succeeded through the safeguard of the Jewish police. Rescue and outside aid =The Righteous Gentiles= The only pharmacy enclosed within the Krak√≥w Ghetto boundary belonged to the Polish Roman Catholic pharmacist Tadeusz Pankiewicz, permitted by the German authorities to operate his \\"Under the Eagle Pharmacy\\" there upon his request. The scarce medications and tranquillizers supplied to the ghetto's residents often free of charge ‚Äì apart from health-care considerations ‚Äì contributed to their survival. Pankiewicz passed around hair dyes to Jews compelled to cross the ghetto walls illegally. In recognition of his heroic deeds in helping countless Jews in the Ghetto during the Holocaust, he was bestowed the title of the Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem on February 10, 1983. Pankiewicz is the author of a book describing, among other events, the ghetto liquidation.David M. Crowe, The Holocaust: Roots, History, and Aftermath. Published by Westview Press. Page 180. The list of several dozen Polish Righteous from Krak√≥w, includes Maria and Bronis≈Çaw Florek who lived at Czy≈º√≥wka Street and saved Goldberger and Nichtberger families. Notably, Maria Florek smuggled forged identity papers procured at the Emalia Factory of Oskar Schindler (without his awareness), for the Jews hiding on the 'Aryan side' of Krak√≥w. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Budy≈Ñski, who provided help without remuneration even to complete strangers, ended up marrying a Jewish girl, Chana Landau in 1943, but they were caught by Gestapo in 1944 and deported to different concentration camps. Both survived, reunited in Krak√≥w, and in 1969 emigrated to Sweden. Polish gynaecologist Dr Helena Szlapak turned her home at Garbarska Street into a safe house for trafficked Jews and distribution of falsified documents as well as secret messages and storage of photographs from Auschwitz. She collaborated with ≈ªegota, attended to sick Jews in hiding and placed them in hospitals under false identities. = ≈ªegota = ≈ªegota also had prominence in Krak√≥w. The goal of ≈ªegota was to aid the Jews on a day-to- day basis ‚Äì rather than aiming for an overall solution. Zegota provided opportunity with false documents, doctors for healthcare, money, and several other pivotal resources and aid for the Jews. In Zegota, historians assert that Polish ‚Äì Jewish relations were strong before the war, and ≈ªegota became involved to strengthen the organically arising aid. Moreover, led by Stanislaw Dobrowolski, food, medicine, funds, and means for escape were provided. Several ≈ªegota members ‚Äì Jozefa Rysinska, Mieczyslaw Kurz, Tadeusz Bilewicz, Zygmunt Kuzma, and Ada Prochnicka ‚Äì facilitated transport of supplies and overall aid in the camps.  Notable people  Movie director Roman Polanski, a survivor of the Ghetto, in his 1984 memoir Roman evoked his childhood experiences there before the mass deportations of Operation Reinhard in Krak√≥w. \\"My own feeling ‚Äì Pola≈Ñski wrote ‚Äì was that if only one could explain to them that we had done nothing wrong, the Germans would realize that it all was a gigantic misunderstanding.\\" Many years later, Roma Ligocka, Polish artist and author, and a first cousin to Roman Pola≈Ñski who, as a small girl, was rescued and survived the Ghetto, wrote a novel based on her experiences, The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir. She is mistakenly thought to be portrayed in the film Schindler's List. The scene, however, was constructed on the memories of Zelig Burkhut, survivor of Plaszow (and other work camps). When being interviewed by Spielberg before the making for the film, Burkhut told of a young girl wearing a pink coat, no older than four, who was shot by a Nazi officer right before his eyes. Oskar Schindler was portrayed in the Thomas Keneally novel Schindler's Ark (the basis for Steven Spielberg's film Schindler's List). In an especially dramatic event, 300 of Schindler's workers were deported to the Auschwitz death camp despite his efforts, and he personally intervened to return them to him. Other notable people include Mordechai Gebirtig, who was one of the most influential and popular writers of Yiddish songs and poems. He was shot there in 1942. Miriam Akavia, an Israeli writer, survived the Krak√≥w ghetto and concentration camps. Renowned dermatologist and co-discoverer of Reyes Syndrome, Dr Jim Jacob Baral was also a Krak√≥w Ghetto survivor; his mother pushed him and his brother Martin under the barbed wire to hide at the home of a Polish rescuer who took them to Bochnia where their mother and sister joined them later. Bernard Offen, born in 1929 in Krak√≥w survived the Ghetto and several Nazi concentration camps. Second lieutenant Jerzy Zakulski, an attorney, and member of the National Armed Forces (Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne, NSZ) in German-occupied Krak√≥w was sentenced to death by Stalinist officials and executed in Soviet-controlled postwar Poland on charges of being an enemy spy. A Jewish Holocaust survivor from Krak√≥w, Maria B≈Çeszy≈Ñska n√©e Bernstein, attempted to save Zakulski's life in gratitude for his rescue of her and her daughter during the Holocaust; however, she was unsuccessful. The certified letter she sent to the Regional Military Court in Warsaw was thrown out, along with the plea for presidential mercy. Zuzanna Ginczanka and her husband left the Lvov ghetto for the Krak√≥w ghetto in September 1942. She was arrested and shot in a prison in January 1945.

Former coats of arms The 1990-2004 coat of arms on the Georgian constitution * 1918-1921 and 1991-2004: This coat of arms was in use by the Democratic Republic of Georgia throughout its existence in 1918‚Äì1921. Though the use of Saint George as Georgia's patron saint was by then a long tradition, there were some discussions about other possibilities, the major one being Amiran, as the symbol of Georgia's fight for freedom from the Russian Empire. However, a decision was then made in favor of Saint George. Restored in 1991, this coat of arms was replaced by the current one in 2004. * 1801-1917: Before 1917, when Georgia was part of the Russian Empire, the Georgian coat of arms appeared on the Greater Coat of Arms of the Russian Empire, as part of the coat of arms of Caucasus.

Commissioned in June 1972 as part of a four-ship order, the Sabalan was originally named IIS Rostam, after Rostam, a legendary hero in the Shahnameh. It was renamed after the Islamic revolution after Sabalan, the Iranian mountain. Service history During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the warship became infamous for attacks against the crews of unarmed and often neutral tankers and other merchant ships. Before these attacks, Sabalans captain would often board the ships and pretend to carry out a friendly inspection, sometimes even dining with the ship's master. Then he would open fire on the ship, sometimes aiming at the ship's bridge and living spaces. Often, the captain would radio his victims \\"Have a nice day\\" as Sabalan departed. These actions earned the captain the nickname \\"Captain Nasty\\".Lee Wise, Harold: Inside the Danger Zone: The U.S. Military in the Persian Gulf, 1987-1988 Following the spillover of the conflict onto the Persian Gulf, the United States deployed warships in 1987 and 1988 to protect reflagged Kuwaiti shipping in the Persian Gulf. During the convoy operations, dubbed Operation Earnest Will, an Iranian mine severely damaged a U.S. frigate. U.S. forces mounted a one-day retaliation called Operation Praying Mantis. The operation's objectives were to destroy two Iranian oil platforms used for drilling and attack coordination and one unspecified Iranian warship. On the morning of April 18, 1988, the oil platforms were knocked out. The U.S. forces then turned to look for Iranian frigates in the Strait of Hormuz, which joins the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. Sabalans sister frigate was identified by aircraft from the aircraft carrier and drawn into a fatal engagement. Another group of A-6 Intruders was sent to the reported location of Sabalan in the strait, where the Sabalan fired at the A-6s at 6.17 p.m. (Gulf time). At 6.18 p.m., an A-6 dropped a Mk-82 500 pound laser-guided bomb, which left Sabalan paralyzed and on fire. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., and U.S. Central Command head Gen. George B. Crist monitored the situation. After discussion, the men decided to spare the moribund Sabalan, perhaps to prevent further escalation. Iranian forces towed the damaged ship to the port of Bandar Abbas, and it was eventually repaired and returned to service.L. Symonds, Craig: Decision at Sea: Five Naval Battles That Shaped American History In January 2014 Sabalan and , a supply ship capable of carrying helicopters, set off from Bandar Abbas, on a reported three-month mission to the United States maritime borders.

He is listed as one of only six players in major league history to do it. The others are Abner Dalrymple (1881), Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928), Barry Bonds (1998) and Josh Hamilton (2008). Career In a 16-year career, Nicholson posted a .268 batting average with 235 home runs and 948 run batted in in 1677 games. At 6 feet tall and 205 pounds, he was an imposing figure at the plate. While awaiting each pitch, he would loosen up with determined practice swings, ending each with his bat aimed at the pitcher, and holding that pose for several seconds. With each practice swing, the fans would chant \\"Swish.\\" Nicknamed \\"Swish\\" because of his mighty swing, which often missed the ball, Nicholson twice led the National League in home runs and runs batted in. He played briefly in the American League for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1936, then spent two years in the minors before joining the Chicago Cubs in 1939. Nicholson became a regular with the Cubs in 1940. His most productive season came in 1943, when he hit .309 with a league-leading 29 home runs and 128 runs batted in. He finished third in the NL MVP Award vote behind Stan Musial and Walker Cooper. In 1944, Nicholson slipped to .287, but he again led the NL in home runs (33), runs batted in (122) and runs (116). In the same season, after hitting four consecutive homers in a July 23 doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, he came to bat with the bases loaded in the eighth inning of the second game, and was intentionally walked. Obviously, that forced in a run, but the Cubs could not score again and the Giants won the game, 12‚Äì10. This time, he lost the MVP honors by one vote to Marty Marion. Although Nicholson helped the Cubs to the 1945 pennant, his failing eyesight resulted in a slip in production. He hit only .243 with 13 home runs and 88 runs batted in during the regular season, and batted just .214 with eight runs batted in during in Chicago's seven-game loss to the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. The eight RBIs was the record for a 7-game World Series. In 1949, Nicholson was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, where he became a part-time player and frequent pinch- hitter. The next season, after he became weak and lost weight, it was disclosed that Nicholson was diabetic. He was unable to play in the World Series with his \\"Whiz Kids\\" teammates against the Yankees. Well respected as one of the toughest men to double up, Nicholson hit into double plays only once every 90.7 at-bats. He finished his career in 1953 with eight pinch homers. Bill Nicholson died in Chestertown, Maryland, at age of 81.

C. (22 October 2017). \\"New-Paradigm Libertarianism: a Very Brief Explanation\\". PhilPapers. Retrieved 26 June 2019. For instance, it has been argued that laissez-faire capitalism does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome,\\"Complexity Economics Shows Us Why Laissez- Faire Economics Always Fails\\". nor does its philosophy of individualism and policies of deregulation prevent the abuse of natural resources. Criticism of left-libertarianism is instead mainly related to anarchism and include allegations of utopianism, tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilization. Furthermore, criticism include left-libertarians' critiques of right-libertarianism and vice versa.  Ethical criticism  ; Aggression and coercion The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others: > Adam Smith's \\"obvious and simple system of natural liberty\\" is not a system > of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part > by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of > others on the freedom of the \\"some\\". [...] What in fact distinguishes this > counterfeit system of \\"laissez-faire\\" (the market) from paternalism, is not > the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the > part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any > responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose > discretion the restraint is administered. Other critics, including John Rawls in Justice as Fairness, argue that implied social contracts justify government actions that violate the rights of some individuals as they are beneficial for society overall. This concept is related to philosophical collectivism as opposed to individualism.Partridge, Ernest (2004). \\"With Liberty and Justice for Some\\". Michael Zimmerman, Baird Callicott, Karen Warren, Irene Klaver and John Clark. Environmental Philosophy: From Animal Rights to Radical Ecology (4th Edition). . However, libertarian philosophers such as Michael Huemer have raised criticisms targeted at the social contract theory. ; Authenticity of libertarian goals Critics such as Corey Robin describe right-libertarianism as fundamentally a reactionary conservative ideology united with more traditional conservative thought and goals by a desire to enforce hierarchical power and social relations: > Conservatism, then, is not a commitment to limited government and liberty‚Äîor > a wariness of change, a belief in evolutionary reform, or a politics of > virtue. These may be the byproducts of conservatism, one or more of its > historically specific and ever-changing modes of expression. But they are > not its animating purpose. Neither is conservatism a makeshift fusion of > capitalists, Christians, and warriors, for that fusion is impelled by a more > elemental force‚Äîthe opposition to the liberation of men and women from the > fetters of their superiors, particularly in the private sphere. Such a view > might seem miles away from the libertarian defense of the free market, with > its celebration of the atomistic and autonomous individual. But it is not. > When the libertarian looks out upon society, he does not see isolated > individuals; he sees private, often hierarchical, groups, where a father > governs his family and an owner his employees. ; Property In his essay \\"From Liberty to Welfare\\", philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse \\"the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state\\". Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor \\"in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires\\". He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor \\"not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs\\". According to Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle \\"ought implies can\\" from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that \\"in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death\\" and that \\"by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs\\". Having argued that \\"ought implies can\\" establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, \\"The Conflict Resolution Principle\\", to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale.Sterba, James P. (October 1994). \\"From Liberty to Welfare.\\" Ethics (Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell). 105 (1). pp. 237‚Äì241. Jeffrey Friedman argues that natural-rights libertarianism's justification for the primacy of property is incoherent: Philosopher Jonathan Wolff criticizes deontological libertarianism as incoherent, writing that it is incapable of explaining why harm suffered by the losers in economic competition does not violate the principle of self- ownership and that its advocates must \\"dishonestly smuggle\\" consequentialist arguments into their reasoning to justify the institution of the free market. Robert Lee Hale has argued that the concept of coercion in right-libertarian theory is applied inconsistently, insofar as it is applied to government actions, but it is not applied to the coercive acts of property owners to preserve their own private property rights.Bruenig, Matt (28 October 2013). \\"Libertarians Are Huge Fans of Economic Coercion\\" . ; Standards of well-being Jeffrey Friedman has criticized right-libertarians for often relying on the unproven assumption that economic growth and affluence inevitably result in happiness and increased quality of life.Friedman, Jeffrey (1993). \\"Politics or Scholarship?\\". Critical Review. 6 (2-3). pp. 429‚Äì445. ; Theory of liberty J. C. Lester has argued that right-libertarianism has no explicit theory of liberty. He supplies a theory of liberty, briefly summarized as the absence of imposed cost. FrederickFrederick, Danny. \\"A Critique of Lester's Account of Liberty\\". PhilPapers.

SSRN. Retrieved 19 May 2020 responded. Both Lester and Frederick are proponents of critical rationalism, the epistemological approach of Karl Popper. Lester has criticized libertarians for neglecting epistemology.  Economic criticism  Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally.\\"They established, among other things, that losses loom larger than gains, that first impressions shape subsequent judgements, that vivid examples carry more weight in decision making than more abstractbut more accurate information\\" ‚Äî 2002 Nobel Prize winner about economic decision making.Erica Goode (5 November 2010). \\"A conversations with Daniel Kahneman; On Profit, Loss and the Mysteries of the Mind\\". The New York Times. Other economic criticisms concern the transition to a right-libertarian society. Jonathan Chait argues that privatizing Social Security would cause a fiscal crisis in the short-term and damage individuals' economic stability in the long-term.Chait, Jonathan (21 March 2005). \\"Blocking Move\\". The New Republic. Retrieved on 23 September 2017.  Environmental criticism  Reconciliation of individual rights and the advances of a free market economy with the environmental degradation is a problem that few right-libertarians have addressed. Political scientist and author Charles Murray has written that stewardship is what private property owners do best. Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many right- libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control. They see natural resources as too difficult to privatize as well as legal responsibility for pollution or degrading biodiversity as too difficult to trace. As a result, some see the rise of right-libertarianism as popular political philosophy as partially responsible for climate change. Right-libertarians are also criticised for ignoring observation and historical fact and instead focusing on an abstract ideal. Imperfection is not accounted for and they are axiomatically opposed to government initiatives to counter the effects of climate change.  Pragmatic criticism  ; Allegation of utopianism Anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a \\"lesser evil\\" than a society without \\"repressive force\\". He also argued that \\"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\\" is an \\"absurdity\\".Landauer, Carl (1959). European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements. However, An Anarchist FAQ states the following: \\"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies [as well as] some sort of \\"court\\" system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\\".An Anarchist FAQ. \\"Does anarchism require \\"perfect people\\" to work?\\".An Anarchist FAQ. \\"What about crime?\\". ; Government decentralization In his essay On Authority, Friedrich Engels claimed that radical decentralization promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilization, citing an example of railways: John Donahue also argues that if political power were radically shifted to local authorities, parochial local interests would predominate at the expense of the whole and that this would exacerbate current problems with collective action.Donahue, John (1 May 1997). \\"The Devil in Devolution\\". American Prospect. 8 (32). In the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.Goodwin, Barbara. (2014). Using Political Ideas. Sixth edition. ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. Hoboken, New Jersey. ; Lack of contemporary examples In 2013, Michael Lind observed that of the 195 countries in the world, none have fully actualized a society as advocated by right-libertarians: Furthermore, Lind has criticized right-libertarianism as being incompatible with democracy and apologetic towards autocracy. In response, right- libertarian Warren Redlich argues that the United States \\"was extremely libertarian from the founding until 1860, and still very libertarian until roughly 1930\\". ; Tacit authoritarianism The anarchist tendency known as platformism has been criticized by Situationists, insurrectionaries, synthesis anarchists\\"Reply by Several Russian Anarchists to the 'Platform'\\".Garner, Jason. \\"La b√∫squeda de la unidad anarquista: la Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica antes de la II Rep√∫blica\\". . \\"Tras la victoria de los plataformistas en el Congreso de Par√≠s de 1929, una secci√≥n de los que consideraron que las ideas tradicionales del anarquismo estaban siendo atacadas se separ√≥ de la UACR para formar la Asociaci√≥n de los Federalistas Anarquistas a comienzos de 192821.

Early years Jaroslav Jan Pelikan Jr. was born on December 17, 1923, in Akron, Ohio, to a Slovak father Jaroslav Jan Pelikan Sr. and Slovak mother Anna Buzekova Pelikan from ≈†id in Serbia. His father was pastor of Trinity Slovak Lutheran Church in Chicago, Illinois, and his paternal grandfather a bishop of the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, then known as the Slovak Lutheran Church in America. According to family members, Pelikan's mother taught him how to use a typewriter when he was three years old, as he could not yet hold a pen properly but wanted to write. Pelikan's facility with languages may be traced to his multilingual childhood and early training. That facility was to serve him well in the career he ultimately chose (after contemplating becoming a concert pianist) as an historian of Christian doctrine. He did not confine his studies to Roman Catholic and Protestant theological history, but also embraced that of the Christian East. In 1946 when he was 22, he earned both a seminary degree from Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, and a PhD at the University of Chicago. Writings and interviews Pelikan wrote more than 30 books, including the five-volume The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine (1971‚Äì1989). Some of his later works attained crossover appeal, reaching beyond the scholarly sphere into the general reading public (notably, Mary Through the Centuries, Jesus Through the Centuries and Whose Bible Is It?). His 1983 Jefferson Lecture, The Vindication of Tradition included an often quoted one liner, which he elaborated in a 1989 interview in U.S. News & World Report. He said: Yale University professor He joined Yale University in 1962 as the Titus Street Professor of Ecclesiastical History and in 1972 was named Sterling Professor of History, a position he held until achieving emeritus status in 1996. He served as acting dean and then dean of the Graduate School from 1973 to 1978 and was the William Clyde DeVane Lecturer 1984‚Äì1986 and again in the fall of 1995. Awards include the Graduate School's 1979 Wilbur Cross Medal and the Medieval Academy of America's 1985 Haskins Medal. While at Yale, Pelikan won a contest sponsored by Field & Stream magazine for Ed Zern's column \\"Exit Laughing\\" to translate the motto of the Madison Avenue Rod, Gun, Bloody Mary & Labrador Retriever Benevolent Association (\\"Keep your powder, your trout flies and your martinis dry\\") into Latin. Pelikan's winning entry mentioned the martini first, but Pelikan explained that it seemed no less than fitting to have the ap√©ritif come first. His winning entry: > Semper siccandae sunt: potio Pulvis, et pelliculatio. Pelikan was appointed to numerous leadership positions in American intellectual life. He was the president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the religion section of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and in 1980 he founded the Council of Scholars at the Library of Congress. In 1983 the National Endowment for the Humanities selected him to deliver the 12th annual Jefferson Lecture, the highest honor conferred by the federal government for outstanding achievement in the humanities. Pelikan's lecture became the basis for his book The Vindication of Tradition. Pelikan gave the 1992‚Äì1993 Gifford lectures at the University of Aberdeen, which were published as the book Christianity and Classical Culture. President Bill Clinton appointed Pelikan to serve on the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Pelikan received honorary degrees from 42 universities around the world. At the age of 80, he was appointed scholarly director for the \\"Institutions of Democracy Project\\" at the Annenberg Foundation. In 2004, having received the John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences, an honor he shared with the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur, Pelikan donated his award ($500,000) to Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, of which he was a trustee. At the ceremony, he quoted a leitmotif passage from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that had moved him all his life: \\"Was du ererbt von deinen Vaetern hast, Erwirb es um es zu besitzen\\" (\\"Take what you have inherited from your fathers and work to make it your own.\\"). Lutheran pastor to Orthodox layman For most of his life Pelikan was a Lutheran and was an ordained pastor in that tradition. In 1998, however, he and his wife Sylvia were received into the Orthodox Church in America at the Chapel of St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York. According to family members (with some mild dislike of the conversion), his conversion followed his meeting Pope John Paul II. Members of Pelikan's family remember him saying that he had not as much converted to Orthodoxy as \\"returned to it, peeling back the layers of my own belief to reveal the Orthodoxy that was always there.\\" Delighted with this turn of phrase, he used it (or close variants) several times among family and friends, including during a visit to St. Vladimir's for Divine Liturgy, the \\"last before his death.\\"Pelikan, Michael P. (May 2006). Unpublished notes. Nevertheless, Pelikan was still ecumenical in many ways. Not long before his own death, he praised Pope John Paul II in an article in The New York Times when the pope died in 2005: > It will be a celebration of the legacy of Pope John Paul II and an answer to > his prayers (and to those of all Christians, beginning with their Lord > himself) if the Eastern and Western churches can produce the necessary > mixture of charity and sincere effort to continue to work toward the time > when they all may be one. Death Pelikan died on May 13, 2006, at his home in Hamden, Connecticut, at the age of 82, after a seventeen-month battle with lung cancer. He was interred at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut, on May 17, 2006. Pelikan was honored by a memorial service in Yale's Battell Chapel on October 10, 2006, with speeches by distinguished scholars and musical performances by cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Yale Russian Chorus.

An outfielder, Hoag played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox, and Cleveland Indians between 1931 and 1945 and was on the winning team in three World Series. He appeared in the 1939 MLB All-Star Game. Career Hoag was born in Davis, California. He played from April 15, 1931, until September 16, 1945. He batted and threw right-handed. He had a lifetime batting average of .271 with 28 home runs and 401 RBIs. After two seasons with the Sacramento Senators, Hoag signed with the New York Yankees after the 1930 season. He spent seven seasons with the Yankees over eight years (playing in 1933 with the Newark Bears). Hoag missed some of the 1936 season due to having a blood clot on the brain, the result of an outfield collision with teammate Joe DiMaggio. Hoag homered for the Yankees' first run as they won the final game of the 1937 World Series. He had a .320 batting average for his three World Series. In 1939, he made the American League All-Star team with the St. Louis Browns after the Yankees traded him there for Oral Hildebrand and Buster Mills. That year, he batted .295 with 75 RBIs and 202 total bases. He was fifth in the league in stolen bases in 1942 with the Chicago White Sox with 17, nearly double his second-best season (nine in 1939). Hoag ended his career with 854 hits in 3,147 at bats.

An electron multiplier is a vacuum-tube structure that multiplies incident charges.. In a process called secondary emission, a single electron can, when bombarded on secondary-emissive material, induce emission of roughly 1 to 3 electrons. If an electric potential is applied between this metal plate and yet another, the emitted electrons will accelerate to the next metal plate and induce secondary emission of still more electrons. This can be repeated a number of times, resulting in a large shower of electrons all collected by a metal anode, all having been triggered by just one.  History  In 1930, Russian physicist Leonid Aleksandrovitch Kubetsky proposed a device which used photocathodes combined with dynodes, or secondary electron emitters, in a single tube to remove secondary electrons by increasing the electric potential through the device. The electron multiplier can use any number of dynodes in total, which use a coefficient, œÉ, and created a gain of œÉn where n is the number of emitters. A discrete electron multiplier  Discrete dynode  Secondary electron emission begins when one electron hits a dynode inside a vacuum chamber and ejects electrons that cascade onto more dynodes and repeats the process over again. The dynodes are set up so that each time an electron hits the next one it will have an increase of about 100 electron Volts greater than the last dynode. Some advantages of using this include a response time in the picoseconds, a high sensitivity, and an electron gain of about 108 electrons. Tao, S., Chan, H., & van der Graaf, H. (2016). Secondary Electron Emission Materials for Transmission Dynodes in Novel Photomultipliers: A Review. Materials, 9(12), 1017. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma9121017 Continuous- dynode electron multiplier  Continuous dynode  A continuous dynode system uses a horn shape funnel of glass coated with a thin film of semiconducting materials. The electrodes have increasing resistance to allow secondary emission. Continuous dynodes use a negative high voltage in the wider end and goes to a positive near ground at the narrow end. The first device of this kind was called a Channel Electron Multiplier (CEM). CEMs required 2-4 kilovolts in order to achieve a gain of 106 electrons. MicrochannelplateWithBreakdown  Microchannel plate  Another geometry of continuous-dynode electron multiplier is called the microchannel plate (MCP).. It may be considered a 2-dimensional parallel array of very small continuous- dynode electron multipliers, built together and powered in parallel. Each microchannel is generally parallel-walled, not tapered or funnel-like. MCPs are constructed from lead glass and carry a resistance of 109 Œ© between each electrode. Each channel has a diameter of 10-100 Œºm. The electron gain for one microchannel plate can be around 104-107 electrons. Applications In mass spectrometry electron multipliers are often used as a detector of ions that have been separated by a mass analyzer of some sort. They can be the continuous-dynode type and may have a curved horn-like funnel shape or can have discrete dynodes as in a photomultiplier. Continuous dynode electron multipliers are also used in NASA missions and are coupled to a gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS) which allows scientists to determine the amount and types of gasses present on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Microchannel plates are also used in night-vision goggles. As electrons hit the millions of channels, they release thousands of secondary electrons. These electrons then hit a phosphor screen where they are amplified and converted back into light. The resulting image patterns the original and allows for better vision in the dark, while only using a small battery pack to provide a voltage for the MCP.

Directed by Peter Tewksbury, the film is based on the 1953 satirical farce novel of the same name by Dan Cushman. The film reached number 65 on the Variety weekly national box office chart in 1968. Plot Native American rodeo rider Joe Lightcloud is a Navajo whose family still lives on the reservation. He returns to the reservation in a white Cadillac convertible that he uses to drive cattle. Joe persuades his congressman to give him 20 heifers and a prize bull so that he and his father can prove that the Navajos can successfully raise cattle on the reservation. If their experiment is successful, the government will help all the Navajo people. But Joe's friend Bronc Hoverty accidentally barbecues the prize bull, while Joe sells the heifers to buy home improvements for his stepmother Annie Lightcloud. Joe is able to borrow a bull named Dominick, but the bull is lackadaisical and shows no interest in the heifers. Mamie Callahan, the daughter of shotgun-toting tavern owner Glenda Callahan, can't seem to stay away from the girl-chasing Joe. Joe trades in his horse at a used car dealership for a red convertible automobile from which he sells off the parts to obtain cash from a salvage yard. After almost all of the usable car parts are sold, Joe rides around in a beat-up motorcycle. To raise money, Joe organizes a contest in which riders have to ride Dominick the bull. Joe himself has to ride Dominick and hang on in order to win the prize money, which he does. In a fight at his father's house, Joe and his friends are involved in a large fight that destroys the house that they have been building.

Presley was paid $850,000 plus 40% of the profits.Michael A. Hoey, Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog, Bear Manor Media 2013 The screenplay was adapted from the failed Broadway musical Whoop-Up and retained many of the same plot devices and characters, including Joe's grandfather who refuses to live in a house, preferring his ancestral teepee. Soundtrack For the first time since Wild in the Country, neither an LP record nor an extended-play single was planned for a Presley film soundtrack. Three songs were written for the film by the stalwart team of Sid Wayne and Ben Weisman, who had already contributed close to 50 songs for various Presley movies in the decade.Jorgensen, Ernst. Elvis Presley A Life in Music: The Complete Recording Sessions. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998; p. 239. Although released before Speedway, this film and its soundtrack were made after the first of Presley's last five films in the 1960s in which musical numbers were kept to a minimum.Jorgensen, op. cit., pp. 229, 239. The recording session took place at RCA Studio B in Nashville on October 1, 1967. At the end of the session, Presley made his record producer Felton Jarvis promise to never release \\"Dominick,\\" the song written for him to sing to the bull. However, the song is actually sung to two women in the movie without the bull present. \\"Dominick\\" would eventually make its first official CD appearance on the Kissin Cousins/Clambake/Stay Away, Joe soundtrack compilation in 1994 (long after the deaths of Presley and Jarvis); it had previously been released, unauthorized, as \\"Dominick the Impotent Bull\\" on the 1982 bootleg compilation Elvis' Greatest Shit. The other two songs, \\"Stay Away, Joe\\" and \\"All I Needed Was the Rain,\\" were not even featured on a promotional single for the film premiere, but instead respectively appeared on the budget albums Let's Be Friends in 1970 and Elvis Sings Flaming Star in 1969. Two additional songs related to the film were recorded at sessions on January 10 and 11, 1968 at the same studio. \\"Goin' Home\\" by Joy Byers would not be used, surfacing on the soundtrack to the next Presley film, Speedway, while a different song entitled \\"Stay Away,\\" rewritten from the tune of \\"Greensleeves\\" by Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett, would appear as the B-side to the #28 hit single \\"U.S. Male.\\"Jorgensen, op. cit., pp. 241-242.

The resulting current can be measured and used to determine the number of ions or electrons hitting the cup. The Faraday cup was named after Michael Faraday who first theorized ions around 1830. Examples of devices which use Faraday cups are space probes (Voyager 1, & 2, Parker Solar Probe, etc.), or mass spectrometers. Principle of operation Faraday cup with an electron-suppressor plate in front When a beam or packet of ions hits the metal, it gains a small net charge while the ions are neutralized. The metal can then be discharged to measure a small current proportional to the number of impinging ions. The Faraday cup is essentially part of a circuit where ions are the charge carriers in vacuum and it is the interface to the solid metal where electrons act as the charge carriers (as in most circuits). By measuring the electric current (the number of electrons flowing through the circuit per second) in the metal part of the circuit, the number of charges being carried by the ions in the vacuum part of the circuit can be determined. For a continuous beam of ions (each with a single charge), the total number of ions hitting the cup per unit time is : \\\\frac {N}{t} = \\\\frac {I}{e} where N is the number of ions observed in a time t (in seconds), I is the measured current (in amperes) and e is the elementary charge (about 1.60 √ó 10‚àí19 C). Thus, a measured current of one nanoamp (10‚àí9 A) corresponds to about 6 billion ions striking the Faraday cup each second. Similarly, a Faraday cup can act as a collector for electrons in a vacuum (e.g. from an electron beam). In this case, electrons simply hit the metal plate/cup and a current is produced. Faraday cups are not as sensitive as electron multiplier detectors, but are highly regarded for accuracy because of the direct relation between the measured current and number of ions. In plasma diagnostics The Faraday cup utilizes a physical principle according to which the electrical charges delivered to the inner surface of a hollow conductor are redistributed around its outer surface due to mutual self-repelling of charges of the same sign ‚Äì a phenomenon discovered by Faraday. Fig. 1. Faraday cup for plasma diagnostics 1 ‚Äì cup-receiver, metal (stainless steel). 2 ‚Äì electron-suppressor lid, metal (stainless steel). 3 ‚Äì grounded shield, metal (stainless steel). 4 ‚Äì insulator (teflon, ceramic). The conventional Faraday cup is applied for measurements of ion (or electron) flows from plasma boundaries and comprises a metallic cylindrical receiver-cup ‚Äì 1 (Fig. 1) closed with, and insulated from, a washer-type metallic electron-suppressor lid ‚Äì 2 provided with the round axial through enter-hollow of an aperture with a surface area S_F=\\\\pi D^2_F/4. Both the receiver cup and the electron-suppressor lid are enveloped in, and insulated from, a grounded cylindrical shield ‚Äì 3 having an axial round hole coinciding with the hole in the electron-suppressor lid ‚Äì 2. The electron- suppressor lid is connected by 50 Œ© RF cable with the source B_{es} of variable DC voltage U_{es}. The receiver-cup is connected by 50 Œ© RF cable through the load resistor R_F with a sweep generator producing saw-type pulses U_g(t). Electric capacity C_F is formed of the capacity of the receiver-cup ‚Äì 1 to the grounded shield ‚Äì 3 and the capacity of the RF cable. The signal from R_F enables an observer to acquire an I-V characteristic of the Faraday cup by oscilloscope. Proper operating conditions: h\\\\geq D_F (due to possible potential sag) and h\\\\ll \\\\lambda_i, where \\\\lambda_i is the ion free path. Signal from R_F is the Faraday cup I-V characteristic which can be observed and memorized by oscilloscope In Fig. 1: 1 ‚Äì cup-receiver, metal (stainless steel). 2 ‚Äì electron-suppressor lid, metal (stainless steel). 3 ‚Äì grounded shield, metal (stainless steel). 4 ‚Äì insulator (teflon, ceramic). C_F ‚Äì capacity of Faraday cup. R_F ‚Äì load resistor. Thus we measure the sum i_\\\\Sigma of the electric currents through the load resistor R_F: i_i (Faraday cup current) plus the current i_c(U_g)=-C_F(dU_g/ dt) induced through the capacitor C_F by the saw-type voltage U_gof the sweep-generator: The current component i_c(U_g) can be measured at the absence of the ion flow and can be subtracted further from the total current i_\\\\Sigma(U_g) measured with plasma to obtain the actual Faraday cup I-V characteristic i_i(U_g) for processing. All of the Faraday cup elements and their assembly that interact with plasma are fabricated usually of temperature-resistant materials (often these are stainless steel and teflon or ceramic for insulators). For processing of the Faraday cup I-V characteristic, we are going to assume that the Faraday cup is installed far enough away from an investigated plasma source where the flow of ions could be considered as the flow of particles with parallel velocities directed exactly along the Faraday cup axis. In this case, the elementary particle current di_i corresponding to the ion density differential dn(v) in the range of velocities between v and v+dv of ions flowing in through operating aperture S_F of the electron-suppressor can be written in the form where e is elementary charge, Z_i is the ion charge state, and f(v) is the one-dimensional ion velocity distribution function. Therefore, the ion current at the ion-decelerating voltage U_g of the Faraday cup can be calculated by integrating Eq. () after substituting Eq. (), ^{\\\\infty} f(v)vdv}} where the lower integration limit is defined from the equation M_iv^2 _{i,s}/2=eZ_i U_g where v_{i,s} is the velocity of the ion stopped by the decelerating potential U_g, and M_i is the ion mass. Thus Eq. () represents the I-V characteristic of the Faraday cup. Differentiating Eq. () with respect to U_g, one can obtain the relation where the value -n_i S_F (eZ_i/M_i ) = C_i is an invariable constant for each measurement. Therefore, the average velocity \\\\langle v_i \\\\rangle of ions arriving into the Faraday cup and their average energy \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{E}_i \\\\rangle can be calculated (under the assumption that we operate with a single type of ion) by the expressions \\\\int\\\\limits_0^\\\\infty i^\\\\prime _i (U_g)dU_g \\\\left ( \\\\int\\\\limits_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{i^\\\\prime _i}{\\\\sqrt{U_g}}dU_g \\\\right )^{-1} [cm/s]}} dU_g \\\\right )^{-1} [eV]}} where M_A is the ion mass in atomic units. The ion concentration n_i in the ion flow at the Faraday cup vicinity can be calculated by the formula which follows from Eq. () at U_g = 0, Fig, 2. Faraday cup I-V characteristic and from the conventional condition for distribution function normalizing Fig. 2 illustrates the I-V characteristic i_i (V) and its first derivative i^\\\\prime _i (V) of the Faraday cup with S_F = 0.5 cm^2 installed at output of the Inductively coupled plasma source powered with RF 13.56 MHz and operating at 6 mTorr of H2. The value of the electron-suppressor voltage (accelerating the ions) was set experimentally at U_{es} = - 170 V, near the point of suppression of the secondary electron emission from the inner surface of the Faraday cup. Error sources The counting of charges collected per unit time is impacted by two error sources: 1) the emission of low-energy secondary electrons from the surface struck by the incident charge and 2) backscattering (~180 degree scattering) of the incident particle, which causes it to leave the collecting surface, at least temporarily. Especially with electrons, it is fundamentally impossible to distinguish between a fresh new incident electron and one that has been backscattered or even a fast secondary electron.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 19, 2000. In the episode, Lisa falls in love with the leader of a radical environmentalist group and tries to impress him by living in Springfield's oldest tree in order to keep it from being cut down. The episode is based on the story of the American tree sitter Julia Butterfly Hill. Actor Joshua Jackson guest starred in the episode as Jesse. Plot Bart, needing money for the new video game console Gamestation 256, takes a job hanging menus on doors for a Thai restaurant. Lisa is concerned that the menus are wasting paper and hurting the environment, but the family ignores her worries. On a trip to Krusty Burger to celebrate Bart's new job, they see protesters dressed as cows on the roof of the restaurant. The protesters unfurl a banner and accuse Krusty Burger of deforesting the rainforest to create grazing land for cattle. The police arrive and shoot the protesters with bean bag rounds. As the protesters are being arrested, Lisa meets their leader‚Äîradical environmentalist Jesse Grass‚Äîand is instantly smitten with him. Lisa visits Jesse in jail, but feels intimidated when she sees that he is more dedicated to environmentalism than she is. She attends a meeting of Jesse's activist group, Dirt First, and learns that an ancient tree in Springfield is scheduled for demolition. Jesse asks if anyone in the group would be willing to live in the tree to prevent its destruction. Lisa, hoping to impress him, volunteers. She climbs the tree and sets up camp, but after a few days she begins to miss her family. She sneaks away from the tree at night and goes home to see them, but finds them asleep. She lies down with them and accidentally falls asleep. When she rushes to the tree in the morning, she finds it has collapsed. Upon returning home, Lisa learns that the tree was not cut down by the loggers, but struck down by lightning, and that she is presumed dead. When Lisa learns that the forest will be turned into a nature preserve in her honor, she decides not to reveal that she is alive. Marge is angered by Lisa's decision, considering the fact that the Simpson family had suffered bad luck when it comes to farces for a noble cause. Homer and Bart immediately begin to take advantage of the sympathy of the townspeople. But when the Rich Texan decides to turn the forest into an amusement park called \\"Lisa Land\\" rather than a nature preserve, Lisa reveals that she survived. Jesse Grass cuts down the log that has been turned into a \\"Lisa Land\\" sign, and it slides down a hill and into Springfield's business district. Jesse is jailed again, and the log travels across the country, passing Mount Rushmore and ultimately winding its way down Lombard Street in San Francisco before reaching the Pacific Ocean and heading out to sea, all set to a parody of This Land is Your Land called This Log is My Log. Production and analysis Julia Butterfly Hill, an environmentalist who lived in a tree for more than two years to prevent it from being cut down, was the inspiration for the episode. \\"Lisa the Tree Hugger\\" was written by Matt Selman and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000‚Äì2001). It is based on a story Selman heard on the radio about Julia Butterfly Hill, an American activist and environmentalist who lived in a millennium-old California Redwood tree known as Luna for more than two years between 1997 and 1999 to prevent loggers from cutting it down. The character Jesse Grass was named after Selman's brother Jesse Selman, who according to Matt acts a lot like Jesse Grass. The last name came from Jesse Selman's bluegrass band named Grass. Canadian American actor Joshua Jackson guest starred in the episode as Jesse Grass. Although guest stars most often record their lines with the cast members of the show, Jackson did not. \\"Lisa the Tree Hugger\\" originally had a different, more complicated ending compared to what is seen in the episode. The final version was added at the last minute of production. In his 2007 book Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the U.S., Roland Kelts analyzed the scenes from the beginning of the episode in which Bart hangs menus on doors for a Thai restaurant. These scenes allude to the film The Matrix. Kelts wrote: \\"Bart needs cash to buy a Japanese game console, so he takes a job delivering flyers for a Thai restaurant. He is quickly taught martial arts so he can drop off the menus with ninja stealth. He runs sideways along walls, his actions accompanied by staccato swishing noises. At one point the scene freezes, he hangs in the air, and the 'camera' does a 360-degree pan around him. The episode dates back to 2000, a year after the look and feel of The Matrix had seeped into viewers' consciousness, and the makers of The Simpsons were very adroitly appropriating it into their shtick.\\" Release and reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 19, 2000. On August 18, 2009, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season. Staff members Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Don Payne, Tom Gammill, Tim Long, Yeardley Smith, and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. Since airing, \\"Lisa the Tree Hugger\\" has received generally positive reactions from critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson described it as \\"arguably [the season's] best show,\\" adding: \\"The first act fares best, as I love Marge‚Äôs tune about saving, and 'Menu Boy' offers a clever spoof of martial arts-based action flicks. 'Hugger' hits a minor lull when Lisa becomes environmentally active, but it bounces back pretty quickly, and the scenes with the runaway log delight. 'Hugger' provides a winner.\\" Den of Geek critic Matt Haigh cited \\"Lisa the Tree Hugger\\" as one of the highlights of season twelve in his review of the box set. Jon Perks of The Birmingham Post highlighted the episode in an article mentioning the twelfth season DVD, writing that like the rest of the season's episodes, \\"Lisa the Tree Hugger\\" is \\"sure to put a smile on anyone's face\\".

(There was an initial operation before Admiral Richard Byrd proposed 'Deep Freeze'). Given the continuing and constant US presence in Antarctica since that date, \\"Operation Deep Freeze\\" has come to be used as a general term for US operations in that continent, and in particular for the regular missions to resupply US Antarctic bases, coordinated by the United States military. Prior to International Geophysical Year R4D-5L \\"Dakota\\" making the first landing at the South Pole, 31 October 1956 Squadron patch for the Navy Antarctic Development Squadron SIX (VXE-6), known as the Puckered Penguins. The U.S. Navy already had a record of earlier exploration in Antarctica. As early as 1839, Captain Charles Wilkes led the first U.S. Naval expedition into Antarctic waters. In 1929, Admiral Richard E. Byrd established a naval base at Little America I, led an expedition to explore further inland, and conducted the first flight over the South Pole. From 1934‚Äì35, the second Byrd Expedition explored much further inland and also \\"wintered over\\". The third Byrd Expedition in 1940 charted the Ross Sea. Byrd was instrumental in the Navy's Operation Highjump after World War II from 1946‚Äì47, which charted most of the Antarctic coastline. In 1948, Commander Finn Ronne led an expedition that photographed over 450,000 square miles (1.1 million km¬≤) by air. Then in 1954‚Äì55, the icebreaker USS Atka (AGB-3) made a scouting expedition for future landing sites and bays. Operation Deep Freeze I The impetus behind Operation Deep Freeze I was the International Geophysical Year 1957‚Äì58. IGY as it was known was a collaborative effort among forty nations to carry out earth science studies from the North Pole to the South Pole and at points in between. The United States along with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Norway, Chile, Argentina, and the U.S.S.R. agreed to go to the South Pole, the least explored area on Earth. Their goal was to advance world knowledge of Antarctic hydrography and weather systems, glacial movements, and marine life. The U.S. Navy was charged with supporting the U.S. scientists for their portion of the IGY studies. In 1955, Task Force 43 was formed to carry out this work. Operation Deep Freeze I prepared a permanent research station and paved the way for more exhaustive research in later Deep Freeze operations. The expedition transpired over the Antarctic summer of November 1955 to April 1956, and was filmed by the U.S. Navy and Walt Disney Studios.

Dufek and others successfully landed an R4D Skytrain (Douglas DC-3) aircraft at the South Pole, as part of the expeditions mounted for the IGY. This was the first aircraft to land at the South Pole and the first time that Americans had set foot on the South Pole. The aircraft was named Que Sera, Sera after a popular song and is now on display at the Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. This marked the beginning of the establishment of the first permanent base, by airlift, at the South Pole (today known as the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station) to support the International Geophysical Year. It was commissioned on January 1, 1957. The original station (\\"Old Byrd\\") lasted about four years before it began to collapse under the snow. Construction of a second underground station in a nearby location began in 1960, and it was used until 1972. The station was then converted into a summer-only field camp until it was abandoned in 2004-05.

Jaron, Aurora Researcher at Byrd Station in 1961. The Jaron Cliffs are named for him.MAP Subsequent developments The Operation Deep Freeze activities were succeeded by \\"Operation Deep Freeze II\\", and so on, continuing a constant US presence in Antarctica since that date. The Coast Guard participated, USCGC Northwind supported the mission throughout the 1970s, 1971‚Äì72, 1972‚Äì73, 1976‚Äì77, 1979-80. The Navy's Antarctic Development Squadron Six had been flying scientific and military missions to Greenland and the arctic compound's Williams Field since 1975. The 109th operated ski-equipped LC-130s had been flying National Science Foundation support missions to Antarctica since 1988. The official name for the Navy's command in Antarctica was US Naval Support, Antarctica. In early 1996, the United States National Guard announced that the 109th Airlift Wing at Schenectady County Airport in Scotia, New York was slated to assume that entire mission from the United States Navy in 1999. The Antarctic operation would be fully funded by the National Science Foundation. The 109th expected to add approximately 235 full-time personnel to support that operation. The decision to switch from Naval leadership to National Guard was one of a cost-saving measure due to post cold war budget cuts. The possibility of the Air National Guard assuming operational control of the mission had first emerged in 1988. The 109th Airlift Wing had been notified that, almost overnight, one of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW) radar sites that it supported in Greenland was going to be shut down. The other sites would soon follow, and the 109th would be largely out of business because its primary mission had ended. The unit had been informally keeping tabs on Navy LC-130 operations supporting the National Science Foundation in Antarctica. Because of its aging aircraft fleet and extensive depot maintenance period, the United States Navy asked if the 109th could provide limited emergency search and rescue (SAR) capability for two years to support Operation Deep Freeze, which the Air Guard accepted. At that time, it had no thought of taking over the mission. The 109th believed it to be an exercise in futility for its aircraft to deploy to the Antarctic to merely wait for emergency SAR missions, so it asked if the Navy could help carry cargo to the South Pole. The Navy resisted at first because its procedures and cargo configurations differed from those of the Air Guard, but eventually it agreed. The main mission of the U.S. Navy and Air National Guard C-130s was to airlift fuel and supplies to the National Science Foundation's South Pole Station so that its personnel could survive the isolation of the long Antarctic winter, which lasted from February to October. An Air National Guard working group had been formed to study the idea in 1990. The following year, a dialog began among the Air National Guard, the Air Staff, and the United States Navy. Among other issues, it was difficult at first for the Air Guard to convince the Air Staff to commit long term resources to an area of the world that had not been declared a warfighting region because of international treaties. The Air Guard had supported military operations in Greenland and the Arctic (including classified U.S. Navy operations) since the mid-1970s with the ski-equipped C-130s of the 109th Airlift Wing. It convinced Headquarters, United States Air Force that it was not in the nation's best interest to abandon the capability to achieve quick and reliable air access to both polar regions. In March 1993, the U.S. Navy hosted a two-day workshop with representatives of the National Science Foundation, Air National Guard, and other interested parties to explore logistics support options for the operation. A draft concept of operations had been prepared by the Air Directorate of the National Guard Bureau in 1993. In February 1996, a commitment was made to transfer the Operation Deep Freeze mission and all LC-130H aircraft operating within the U.S. Department of Defense to the Air National Guard. In September 1996, senior officers from the 109th Airlift Wing briefed the National Guard Bureau on their concept of operations and the status of their preparations to implement Operation Deep Freeze. US Air Force C-141 Starlifter participating in Operation Deep Freeze. Under the transition plan which they had developed, the Air National Guard would continue to augment the United States Navy during the October 1996 ‚Äì March 1997 operating season for the United States Antarctic Program. At the end of the October 1997 ‚Äì March 1998 season, the Air National Guard would assume command of the program. During the third year of the transition program (October 1998 to March 1999), the U.S. Navy would augment the ANG before the latter took over the entire program the following year. There would be seven LC-130s in theater. They would stage from Christchurch International Airport in Christchurch, New Zealand to McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Traditional Guardsmen, technicians, and the cadre of Active Guard Reservists specifically brought on board to support Operation Deep Freeze would all be involved in the mission. When fully transitioned to the Air National Guard, the 109th Airlift Wing would have ten LC-130s in its inventory. These would include upgrades of four LC-130 aircraft in-service with the unit plus three new aircraft and three that would be transferred from the U.S. Navy. Air National Guard estimates of the savings to be realized by consolidating the operation in the hands of the 109th Airlift Wing ranged from US $5 million to US$15 million a year. The actual transition to Air Guard control began in March 1996. By 1999, the United States Navy had transferred military support operations for Antarctica over to the United States Air Force and its contractor Raytheon Polar Services. Operation Deep Freeze was managed by the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard members of Air National Guard Detachment 13, a subordinate unit which administratively reported directly to the Air National Guard Readiness Center (ANGRC) at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, and operationally reported to United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) in Honolulu, Hawaii. Upon its deactivation in 2005, the detachment consisted of a full-time officer (Commander) and four full-time non- commissioned officers (Logistics, Communications, Security Forces, and Information Management) which remained in New Zealand year-round. Operational command now belongs to Commander, Thirteenth Air Force as part of USPACOM. In 2005, through the office of the Secretary of Defense, the commander of U.S. Pacific Command was designated to support the Joint Task Force Support Forces Antarctica, Operation Deep Freeze. CDRUSPACOM delegated this joint operation to the Commander, Pacific Air Forces, who then delegated primary responsibility for execution of the JTF SFA operation to the Commander, 13th Air Force. Current status Airmen saluting the last LC-130 to depart from Antarctica in 2010 United States civilian and scientific operations on the Antarctic continent are overseen by the United States Antarctic Program as well as the National Science Foundation. Military support missions flown from Christchurch International Airport are conducted during the Antarctic summer (late September to early March) each year by The 109th Airlift Wing Scotia New York. The Ski equipped LC-130 Hercules is the backbone of Operation Deep Freeze. Without the capability of the 139th Air Lift Squadron many of the research projects would cease. LC-130 Hercules aircraft provide the logistical movement of cargo to remote operating locations on the continent. These aircraft are augmented by the United States Coast Guard icebreaker USCGC Polar Star, the Air Force Materiel Command, and the Military Sealift Command. The United States Air Force 13th Air Expeditionary Group deploys to Christchurch, New Zealand during the operational season. A documentary on the early missions, Ice Eagles: An Account of American Aviation in Antarctica, was scheduled to be released in 2016. Lockheed Martin is currently the prime contractor for the National Science Foundation's United States Antarctic Program. The contract award was announced via a NSF press release on 28 December 2011 after a bid solicitation process of almost four years. Support operations began on 1 April 2012. The original contract synopsis indicated that the government was contemplating a contract period of years.

It was fought by the Swedes to prevent the loss of the city of Stralsund to Danish and Saxon forces.  Prelude  During 1712, all of Sweden's dominions south of the Baltic Sea, apart from forts, had been conquered by the allies Denmark, Saxony, and Russia. In the Baltic the Danish admiral Gyldenl√∏ve patrolled with a squadron to disrupt Swedish supply lines to the Continent. It was vital for Sweden not to lose Stralsund, as it was the gateway to campaigns in Poland. While a Danish army moved in the region of Hamburg, a large Russian-Saxon force stood south of Stralsund. Stenbock could hardly attack this force with a frontal assault, but hoped that by moving west towards Mecklenburg it could be encircled or scattered. Such a movement would also prevent the joining of the two allied forces. The Danish army under Frederick IV of Denmark was led by general Jobst von Scholten closer to the Russian-Saxon army, and on December 3 the Danish forces reached the little town of Gadebusch, southwest of Wismar. The allied movements were slowed due to disagreements among the allied commanders. On December 8 he marched the Swedish army to Gross Br√ºtz less than ten kilometers east of Gadebusch. Now the Russian infantry was too far away to assist the Danes, but the Saxon cavalry under Jacob Heinrich von Flemming was approaching quickly. That night the Danish forces broke camp and moved to a better position around the village of Wakenst√§dt, three kilometers south of and today incorporated by Gadebusch. Scholten expected the Swedish attack to come from the south to avoid the marshy Radegast river. At four in the morning of December 9 the Danish army was arrayed in defensive formation, with cavalry wings flanking the infantry in the center. As hours passed, snowfall turned to rain. Finally, the Saxon cavalry under Flemming arrived at Wakenst√§dt at mid- morning. Swedish reconnaissance made it clear that the only Swedish option was a frontal assault. Stenbock judged that although the passable terrain was narrow and his men somewhat outnumbered, the thirty Swedish field guns would provide an advantage over the Danish thirteen.  Battle  Map of the battle The Swedish onslaught from the east began around 11 a.m.. Swedish artillery opened fire on the tightly grouped Danish battalions and provided cover for the deploying cavalry and infantry. Stenbock held a short speech to his battleready army: ‚ÄùNu sen I f√∂r Eden v√•ra fiender, ha¬¥n I lust att g√• p√• dem och visa Eder k√§rlek f√∂r Eder Konung och F√§dernesland?‚Äù (Now you see your enemies before you, do you wish to get at them and show your love for your king and Fatherland?) the answers from the army was a resounding ‚ÄùJA!‚Äù (Yes!).http://www.amal.se/download/5956/gadebusch.pdf page. 7 At 1 p.m. the order to attack was given. While the artillery kept firing, the infantry marched towards the Danes, not firing until reaching a distance of twelve paces. During this time, the Danish opponent remained relatively passive although firing several long range volleys with little effect. A Danish cavalry counterattack was broken by the infantry, supported by the constant artillery fire. To the north, the Swedish cavalry made a flanking movement and surprised the Danish cavalry on the Danish left wing. The subsequent retreat into Wakenst√§dt caused confusion in the Danish ranks, which was exploited by the infantry on the Swedish right wing. Meanwhile, heavy fighting was taking place on the Danish right wing where the elite of the Danish army, the royal guard, was positioned supported by the main bulk of the Saxon cavalry. But despite the numerical superiority of the allies, attacks by the Saxon cavalry were repelled. The two Danish guard regiments fought a hard pressed meele battle with the Swedish Dalarna Regiment and H√§lsinge Regiment, the fight was eventually won by the Swedes when the Danes realized that cavalry support would not come (the cavalry was engaged with the Swedish cavalry during the whole fight) while they were slowly pushed back by the Swedish infantry onslaught. Eventually the order for retreat came and the guard regiments withdrew in quite good order but with big losses, the Swedes were tired and had also taken considerable losses from the battle and could not make any determined pursuits. The battle wound down by dusk: Danish and Saxon forces withdrew more or less orderly to a position several kilometers west of Gadebusch to regroup. All of the Danish artillery had been abandoned.  Aftermath  After the battle Stenbock was promoted to Field Marshal by an approving King Charles. The battle was won by efficient use of artillery combined with determined flanking attacks by infantry and cavalry, and it gave the hard-pressed Swedish forces some well needed breathing room. Stenbock who had earlier fought in the Nine Years' War, later pronounced: \\"Never have I seen such a combination of uncontrollable dash and perfectly controlled discipline, such soldiers and such subjects are not to be found the wide world over except in Sweden.\\" About his Swedish troops that fought and died in this masterpiece-tactical victory in the battle of Gadebusch. Even from the other side, Maurice of Saxony claimed the Swedish bravery at Gadebusch to have been absolutely astounding.Charles XII and the Collapse of the Swedish Empire, 1682- 1719 - R. Nisbet Bain Strategically, however, there was little impact, and the allies with their overwhelming numerical superiority would surround and defeat Stenbock's forces after a siege in the fortress of T√∂nningen the next year.

The Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, or SERS for short, is an urban redevelopment strategy employed by the Housing and Development Board in Singapore in maintaining and upgrading public housing flats in older estates in the city-state. Launched in August 1995, it involves a small selection of specific flats in older estates which undergo demolition and redevelopment to optimise land use, as opposed to upgrading of existing flats via the Main Upgrading and Interim Upgrading Programmes. To date, 80 SERS sites have been announced, of which 65 were completed. The implementation of SERS also depends on the availability of replacement sites and the Government‚Äôs financial resources. It will be replaced by Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) in 20 years time. Only 4% of HDB flats have been identified for SERS since it was launched in 1995. All residents displaced by the redevelopment works are offered a new 99-year lease in new flats constructed nearby. These residents have the privilege to select their units prior to public release of the remaining units, are compensated financially, and are given subsidised prices for their new flats. The scheme also gives residents the opportunity to continue living near their kin and neighbours, thereby retaining kinship bonds and strengthening community ties.

Definition Clapboard in modern American usage is a word for long, thin boards used to cover walls and (formerly) roofs of buildings. Historically, it has also been called clawboard and cloboard.Whitney, William Dwight. \\"Clapboard\\" def. 1. The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language,. New York: The Century Co., 188991. Print. In Australia and New Zealand, the term weatherboard is always used. An older meaning of \\"clapboard\\" is small split pieces of oak imported from Germany for use as barrel staves, and the name is a partial translation (from klappen, \\"to fit\\") of Middle Dutch klapholt and related to German Klappholz. Types =Riven= Clapboards were originally riven radially producing triangular or \\"feather-edged\\" sections, attached thin side up and overlapped thick over thin to shed water.Heart side of boards. PopularWoodworking.com. =Radially sawn= Later, the boards were radially sawn in a type of sawmill called a clapboard mill, producing vertical-grain clapboards. The more commonly used boards in New England are vertical-grain boards. Depending on the diameter of the log, cuts are made from deep along the full length of the log. Each time the log turns for the next cut, it is rotated until it has turned 360¬∞. This gives the radially sawn clapboard its taper and true vertical grain. =Flat-sawn= Flat-grain clapboards are cut tangent to the annual growth rings of the tree. As this technique was common in most parts of the British Isles, it was carried by immigrants to their colonies in the Americas and in Australia and New Zealand. Flat-sawn wood cups more and does not hold paint as well as radially sawn wood. =Chamferboard= Chamferboard house exterior (closeup), Brisbane, 2015 Chamferboards are an Australian form of weatherboarding using tongue-and-groove joints to link the boards together to give a flatter external appearance than regular angled weatherboards. =Finger jointed= Some modern clapboards are made up of shorter pieces of wood finger jointed together with an adhesive. Wood species In North America clapboards were historically made of split oak, pine and spruce. Modern clapboards are available in red cedar and pine. In some areas, clapboards were traditionally left as raw wood, relying upon good air circulation and the use of 'semi-hardwoods' to keep the boards from rotting. These boards eventually go grey as the tannins are washed out from the wood. More recently clapboard has been tarred or painted‚Äîtraditionally black or white due to locally occurring minerals or pigments. In modern clapboard these colors remain popular, but with a hugely wider variety due to chemical pigments and stains. Clapboard houses may be found in most parts of the British Isles, and the style may be part of all types of traditional building, from cottages to windmills, shops to workshops, as well as many others. In New Zealand, clapboard housing dominates buildings before 1960. Clapboard, with a corrugated iron roof, was found to be a cost-effective building style. After the big earthquakes of 1855 and 1931, wooden buildings were perceived as being less vulnerable to damage. Clapboard is always referred to as 'weatherboard' in New Zealand. Newer, cheaper designs often imitate the form of clapboard construction as \\"siding\\" made of vinyl (uPVC), aluminum, fiber cement, or other man-made materials.

He was apprenticed to Richard Tottel and Sir President King Antonio Walters and took up the freedom of the Stationers' Company on 30 August 1560. In 1564 he set up his own printing house in White Cross Street, Cripplegate, but in the following year he moved to Paternoster Row, at the sign of the Star, where he remained for many years. His printing office was well supplied with good type in all sizes, from nonpareil to great primer, and he had a fine range of initial letters, ornaments and borders. He was particularly fond of arranging his titles with a lace border formed of printers' flowers and showed much ingenuity in their arrangement. When Henry Bynneman died in 1583, he appointed Denham and Ralph Newbery to be his executors. Shortly after this it is thought that Denham started the Eliot's Court Printing House. Denham was an industrious printer and in 1583 was returned as having four presses; in 1586-7 and 1588-9 he served as Junior Warden of the Stationers' Company, but he never became Master. About 1585 he removed to Aldersgate Street. The last entry under his name occurs in the Registers on 3 December 1589, after which nothing more is heard of him.

The system consists of the land, oceans, atmosphere, polar regions, life, the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes human society, so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society and the subsequent effects on the environment. International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme More completely, the term \\"global change\\" encompasses: population, climate, the economy, resource use, energy development, transport, communication, land use and land cover, urbanization, globalization, atmospheric circulation, ocean circulation, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the water cycle and other cycles, sea ice loss, sea-level rise, food webs, biological diversity, pollution, health, over fishing, and more.  History of global-change research  In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin set up an international program called the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council for Science (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, Paul Crutzen, H. Oeschger and others, successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them. IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference, led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, \\"In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever- increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change.\\" The declaration goes on to say, \\"The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed.\\" Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, DIVERSITAS. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership. In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.  Causes  In the past, the main drivers of global change have been solar variation, plate tectonics, volcanism, proliferation and abatement of life, meteorite impact, resource depletion, changes in Earth's orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is the growing human population's demand for resources; some experts and scientists have described this phenomena as the anthropocene epoch. In the last 250 years, human-caused change has accelerated and caused climate change, widespread species extinctions, fish-stock collapse, desertification, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, pollution, and other large-scale shifts. Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a \\"no analogue\\" state. Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. Homo sapiens have been around for about 200,000 years.  Physical evidence  Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the industrial revolution in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the Haber-Bosch process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of fertilizers, led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes. The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's human population became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's freshwater resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people. These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are rising fast. Over Antarctica a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical rainforests disappeared. In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the Anthropocene. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of one state and into a new state.  Society  Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change. Terms closely related to global change and society are globalization and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with settlers in the Indus Valley, in modern-day India. Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, cultures, people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, conflicts, religions and taboos. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale. Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the United States, Europe and much of Asia into recession. According to the Global Carbon Project, global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.  Planetary management  Humans are altering the planet's biogeochemical cycles in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences. Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system ‚Äì the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components ‚Äì it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an ocean circulation, the Amazon rainforest, or Arctic sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to savanna, or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly. Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid ‚Äì a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined \\"planetary boundaries\\" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive. There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing \\"Earth's life support system\\". The United Nations was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change, Montreal Protocol, Convention to Combat Desertification, and Convention on Biological Diversity. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In 2004, the IGBP published \\"Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure.\\" The publication's executive summary concluded: \\"An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required\\". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment. In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the \\"United Nations Environment Organization\\". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a \\"programme\\", rather than an \\"organization\\" in the tradition of the World Health Organization or the World Meteorological Organization, weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/C08-0036-Ivanova- International.pdf  See also  *Biogeochemistry *Climate change *Earth system science ** Earth system governance *Global issue *Ozone depletion *Sustainability *Tipping point (climatology) References External links * Climate change Environmental science Change Biological globalization World Change Complex systems theory ","title":"Global change"},{"id":"1777500","text":"Strategy First Inc. is a Canadian video game publisher based in Montreal. Founded in 1988 by Don McFatridge, Steve Wall and Dave Hill, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and was subsequently acquired by Silverstar Holdings in 2005. Initially specializing in developing strategy video games, it since switched to primarily publishing, releasing games like the Disciples series, the Jagged Alliance series, O.R.B: Off-World Resource Base, and the Space Empires series.  History  The original logo for Strategy First; each character represents one of the four founding partners, as well as a strategy sub-genre the company intended to develop. Strategy First was founded by Don McFatridge, Steve Wall and Dave Hill, three board game designers. During one lunch break in 1988, they decided that they would begin their careers anew, establishing Strategy First as a video game development company. Richard Therrien joined as a partner shortly thereafter. The four wished to focus on strategy video games and named the company accordingly. By May 2004, Strategy First had amassed over in debt and had shrunk from more than 100 employees in three offices to sixteen staff in its primary office in Montreal. The debts included almost owed to investors, as well as owed to developers. As a result, Strategy First filed for bankruptcy on 4 August 2004. Due to this insolvency, multiple developers, including Stardock and Paradox Interactive, did not receive royalties for their respective games published by Strategy First. Subsequently, Polish developer Techland cut all ties with Strategy First, disallowing Strategy First from distributing any Techland product, effective on 18 September. Silverstar Holdings, a public company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that specialized in the acquisition of pay-to-play businesses, announced on 22 April 2005 that it had acquired Strategy First from the bankruptcy proceedings. The company contributed in cash and 400,000 shares of common stock to Strategy First's creditors, while also assuming of Strategy First's existing debt. Clive Kabatznik, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Silverstar Holdings, stated that the company intended to use Strategy First as a niche publisher, in parallel to its other recent acquisition, Empire Interactive, which Kabatznik described as a \\"more fully fledged publisher\\". In April 2005, Strategy First acquired and absorbed all assets of Santa Rosa, California-based developer Malfador Machinations. That company's president and CEO, Aaron Hall, joined Strategy First's management team as a result. In March 2009, Silverstar Holdings was delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange. Subsequently, Empire Interactive was put into administration in May, with 49 out of 55 positions terminated.

Context The Kalmar Union of the three former Scandinavian Kingdoms of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark lasted on and off from 1397 to 1523, until it finally collapsed following the continued Swedish resentment of Danish domination.Bj√∏rn Poulsen, Home > About Denmark > History > The Middle Ages > The Kalmar Union , Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, March 7, 2008 A successful rebellion in 1471 led to Swedish victory at the Battle of Brunkeberg, which established a powerful anti-Union movement under the leadership of the Bonde‚ÄìSture nobles. In 1520, Christian II of Denmark reconquered Sweden and took a bloody revenge on the anti-Union faction at the Stockholm Bloodbath.Forside > Om Sverige > Historie , Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\"Danish Embassy, Stockholm\\", August 5, 2009 More than 80 noble men and ladies, including leading citizens of Stockholm, were executed, but the result severely backfired on Christian II. The violence elicited strong reactions in Sweden for years to come, and the Union was broken by the successful Swedish War of Liberation from 1521 to 1523. Christian II was condemned by the Pope, and he abdicated in 1523. The subsequent Danish kings Frederick I and Christian III, turned their attention mainly on the Reformation in Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Holstein and the Count's Feud civil war, and relations with Sweden were generally peaceful.Knud J.V. Jespersen, Home > About Denmark > History > Reformation & Absolutism > Danish Sovereignty , Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, February 13, 2008 In Sweden, the internal power vacuum, combined with the abdication of Christian II, provided the opportunity for Gustav Vasa to consolidate control of Sweden and claim the throne in June 1523, with the support of peasants and the Hanseatic towns of L√ºbeck and Danzig. Under Vasa, the Kalmar Union was finally dissolved, and Sweden began establishing itself as a rival power of Denmark‚ÄìNorway. Gustav Vasa's Sweden was in a weak position in 1523, as access to the North Sea was dominated by the Danish Sound Dues and limited to a 20 kilometer stretch on the Kattegat in the vicinity of √Ñlvsborg Fortress, where modern Gothenburg was later founded. Furthermore, Denmark controlled the Baltic, limiting Swedish movement there. Gustav Vasa changed the military structure in Sweden, which did not bear immediate fruit in the Nordic Seven Years' War but was to have a lasting impact on Sweden‚Äôs fortune. In 1544 he used the old Scandinavian concept of Uppb√•d (levy or the prerogative to call up some fraction of men from each district in an emergency) to establish the first native standing army in Europe. The men served on standby, remaining at home in peacetime, and being paid by tax concessions, but were required to assemble and drill. This system was later expanded as the Swedish allotment system. By 1560 when Gustav Vasa died, every ten peasants were required to provide one soldier who must serve anywhere domestic or foreign as required by the king. Casus belli Frederick II (1534‚Äì1588), King of Denmark and Norway 1559‚Äì1588 After the deaths of Christian III and Gustav Vasa, in 1559 and 1560 respectively, both countries now had young and hawkish monarchs, Eric XIV of Sweden and Frederick II of Denmark. Frederick II envisioned the resurrection of the Kalmar Union under Danish leadership, while Eric wanted to finally break the dominating position of Denmark.Knud J.V. Jespersen, Home > About Denmark > History > Reformation & Absolutism > The Dano-Swedish Wars , Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, March 7, 2008 Shortly after his coronation in 1559, King Frederick II of Denmark ordered his ageing field-commander Johan Rantzau to avenge the humiliating Danish defeat against the small peasant republic of Ditmarsh, which was defeated in a matter of a few weeks and brought under the Danish- Norwegian crown. During the next year, the Danish expansion continued with the possession of the Baltic Sea island of √ñsel.N√§r H√§nde Vad?: Historisk uppslagsbok 1500-2002 (2002) pp. 41 Eric XIV (1533‚Äì1577), King of Sweden 1560‚Äì1568 In 1561, when a sizeable remnant of the Order states in the northern Baltics were secularized by its grand master Gotthard Kettler, both Denmark and Sweden were attracted to intervene in the Livonian War.N√§r H√§nde Vad?: Historisk uppslagsbok 1500-2002 (2002) pp. 42 During this conflict, King Eric of Sweden successfully obstructed the Danish plans to conquer Estonia. He sought to dominate the Baltic Sea, while unsuccessfully pressing for Frederick to remove the traditionally Swedish insignia of Three Crowns from the Danish coat of arms;Den Nordiske Syv√•rskrig at Gyldendals √Öbne Encyklop√¶di a bone of contention since Christian III and Gustav Vasa. In February 1563, Swedish messengers were sent to Hesse to negotiate Eric's marriage with Christine of Hesse but were held back in Copenhagen. In retaliation, Eric added the insignia of Norway and Denmark to his own coat of arms and refused Danish requests to remove these symbols. L√ºbeck, upset over obstacles to trade introduced by Eric to hinder the Russian trade as well as withdrawn trade privileges, joined Denmark in a war alliance. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union also joined, desiring control of the Baltic trade. Skirmishes broke out in May 1563, before war was officially declared in August that year. War = Initial phase = In May, the first movements of the war started as a Danish fleet under Jakob Brockenhuus sailed towards the Baltic. At Bornholm, on 30 May 1563, the fleet fired on the Swedish navy under Jakob Bagge, even though war had not officially been declared. A battle arose that ended with Danish defeat. German royal emissaries were sent to negotiate a peace, but at the meeting place of Rostock no Swedes appeared. On 13 August 1563, war was declared by emissaries from Denmark and L√ºbeck in Stockholm. The same month, Danish king Fredrik II attacked √Ñlvsborg. At the beginning of the war the Danes advanced from Halland with a 25,000-strong army of professional mercenaries and captured Sweden's gateway to the west, √Ñlvsborg Fortress, after only three days of bombardment and a six-hour assault on 4 September. This achieved the Danish aim of cutting off Sweden from the North Sea, blocking the all-important salt imports. Eric then attacked Halmstad, without result; the Swedish counterattack was driven back by the professional Danish army. After the king's departure from his army, Charley de Mornays stepped in as the commanding officer and was beaten by the Danish at the Battle of Mared. At sea a battle broke out near √ñland on 11 September, whereafter the war took a pause. = Campaigns = South Herluf Trolle in 1551 On 30 May 1564 a battle broke out between the Swedish navy and the Danish‚ÄìL√ºbeck navy between Gotland and √ñland. The Swedish navy was under the command of Jakob Bagge, and the Danish‚ÄìL√ºbeck navy was under the command of Herluf Trolle. Bagge was captured and the largest warship of the Baltic, the Mars (also known as the Makal√∂s), sunk. The Swedish navy retreated to Stockholm leaving a sea blockade in effect. Klas Horn became the new commander and met the Danish fleet at the island Jungfrun north of √ñland 14 August. An inconclusive fight left the sea blockade in effect. Daniel Rantzau Horn attacked the provinces Halland and Sk√•ne in 1565 and made several attempts at Bohusl√§n and Uddevalla. The Danish burned old L√∂d√∂se in the province of V√§sterg√∂tland. Eric initially led the army against the Danish himself, but then turned over command to Nils Boije, who on 28 August 1564 took Varberg. The Danish army under Daniel Rantzau beat the Swedish army in the Battle of Axtorna on 20 October. The Swedes fared better at sea. Horn, commanding the Swedish navy, pursued a Danish‚ÄìL√ºbeck fleet onto the German coast where most of it was destroyed. After this victory Horn steered for √ñresund and levied a toll on passing ships. On 4 June 1565, the Battle at Buchow took place on the Mecklenburg coast, in which the Danish‚ÄìL√ºbeck commander Herluf Trolle was mortally wounded. In the Battle of 7 July 1565, the Swedish navy under Horn defeated a Danish‚ÄìL√ºbeck navy under Otto Rud near Bornholm, where Sweden captured the Danish flagship the Jegermesther. Thus ensured the command of the eastern Baltic by the Swedes that year. In January 1566 Sweden unsuccessfully laid siege to Bohus Fortress in Bohusl√§n (then a Norwegian province). Daniel Rantzau then moved his forces into V√§sterg√∂tland. At sea Horn returned to taking toll charges in the Baltic. An indecisive battle at sea outside of √ñland occurred on 26 July 1566. On 28 July half the Danish‚ÄìL√ºbeck Navy was lost in a storm at sea. Horn was then called to command troops on land, where he died 9 September.  North  Sweden occupied the undefended Norwegian province of Jemtland, which was quickly reconquered by a counterattack by forces under command of the Norwegian governor of Tr√∏ndelag. The forces were unwilling to launch a counterattack on Swedish land. In 1564 the Swedes marched under Claude Collart and re-occupied Jemtland, as well as Herjedalen and Tr√∏ndelag, including the city of Trondheim. Initially facing little opposition from the locals, their subsequent ill treatment of the Tr√∏ndelag natives, along with tax pressure, laid the groundwork for later resistance to Swedish invasion. Also, Tr√∏ndelag was assisted by the governor of Bergenhus, Erik Rosenkrantz, who forced 3500 local peasants to assist him and his 50 professional soldiers. The Swedes saw Bergenhus as their next target. Although the 400 Swedish soldiers were repelled from Tr√∏ndelag, Sweden continued to occupy J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen. These provinces were later regained by Denmark‚ÄìNorway following the peace process in 1570.Ersland and Sandvik, 1999: pp. 205‚Äì206 Sweden also launched attacks towards Eastern Norway. In the south-east Sweden captured B√•hus Fortress, but lost it in 1566. Another part of the army marched through the valley √òsterdalen in 1567, captured Hamar, and continued towards Oslo. They reached as far as the Skiensfjord, and torched Skien at one point. In Oslo, however, citizens torched the city before invaders could seize it. From the south-east, more Swedish forces were then sent to aid in capturing Akershus Fortress near Oslo. These forces torched Konghelle and Sarpsborg on their way. They were repelled from Oslo by local forces together with men belonging to Erik Rosenkrantz and the King of Denmark and Norway. The Swedes retreated in a north-eastern direction, torching Hamar on their way, destroying Hamar Cathedral and the bishop's fortified palace Hamarhus. =Later phase= John III (1537‚Äì1592), King of Sweden 1568‚Äì1592 The Danish mercenary army was superior to the Swedish peasant army, but the professional army would not fight until their pay was current. Because only a fraction of the army would march, Denmark had to give up the plan to take the fortress of Kalmar and settle for an attack on Stockholm instead. In August 1564, Eric attacked Blekinge and his army occupied it cruelly (most infamously during the Ronneby Bloodbath), though the Danish later reclaimed this. Eric XIV turned insane, paralyzing the Swedish war effort. The Danish were exhausted and made no serious attacks until Rantzau attacked Sm√•land and √ñsterg√∂tland with about 8,500 men. He burned every field and house and destroyed every head of livestock he could. An attempt to cut off his retreat over the Holaveden failed, as Rantzius' army went over the ice of lake Sommen and in the middle of February 1568 he returned to Halland. Attempts were made to make peace between the fighting nations during these years. Negotiators included the dukes of Pomerania, French messenger Charles Dancay, and Holy Roman Emperors Ferdinand I and Maximilian II. The emperors wanted Denmark and Sweden to give back the territories won in Livonia, during the ongoing Livonian War, but Sweden refused to give in to those demands.Eriksson 2007, pp.49‚Äì50 In 1568, the Swedish duke John staged a successful coup d'etat against his brother, King Eric. Enthroned as king with the name John III, he began negotiations with Denmark, and on 18 November the same year this led to a draft peace agreement in Roskilde. This was turned down by the Swedes, however, and in 1569 war stirred again. The Danes attacked and reclaimed Varberg, on 13 November. The Swedes on the other hand now had great success in Sk√•ne.  Peace negotiations and consequences  At this point, both armies were exhausted, leading to further negotiations toward peace. In September 1570 a meeting began in Stettin and peace was finally reached on 13 December 1570 with the Treaty of Stettin. The Swedish king withdrew the claims to Norway, Sk√•ne, Halland, Blekinge, and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden. The Baltic Sea was declared sovereign Danish. In addition, the Kalmar Union was declared dissolved. The Swedes ransomed √Ñlvsborg with 150,000 riksdaler and had to hand back captured warships. The disputes concerning the Three Crowns insignia were unresolved and remained a source of future conflict.

The route connects the Pigeon River Bridge, where it crosses into the United States and becomes Minnesota State Highway 61, with a junction at Highway 11, Highway 17 and the Harbour Expressway in Thunder Bay. The highway forms part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. Highway 61 was added to the highway system on October 6, 1937, following the amalgamation of the Department of Northern Development into the Department of Highways. Prior to that it was known as the Scott Highway. The bridge over the Pigeon River was originally known as The Outlaw, as it was constructed without formal approval of the Canadian or American governments.  Route description  Highway 61 passes by mountain ranges north of the Pigeon River Crossing the American border, the Pigeon River Bridge is west of the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge and east of the Fort Frances-International Falls International Bridge, and is near a visitor center. Highway 61 begins at the Ontario-Minnesota border at the Pigeon River; the road continues south to Duluth as State Highway 61 on the American side. Proceeding north from the border, the route passes the customs station and curves to the north. Passing its former routing along Highway 593, the highway curves eastward to avoid mountains. It zig-zags around a range of mountains, eventually turning northward and passing to the west of Cloud Bay. The highway continues north for through Neebing, running between mountain ranges on either side. It rises at Moose Hill, meets Highway 608 and enters one of the few agricultural areas in northwestern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, Highway 61 curves to the east, passing the southern terminus of Highway 130 along the way. It then enters the outskirts of Thunder Bay. Highway 61 near Highway 608 The highway passes Chippewa Road, its former route through Thunder Bay, and returns to its northward orientation. It officially enters the city as it crosses the Kaministiquia River. The highway swerves east at Thunder Bay International Airport as it widens to four lanes then continues north, crossing Arthur Street. North of Arthur Street, the highway is also known as the Thunder Bay Expressway. It continues north for and ends at the Harbour Expressway and Trans-Canada Highway. The northernmost section in Thunder Bay is a four-lane, undivided expressway. The remainder of Highway 61 is a conventional two-lane highway. Traffic volumes along the southern portion of the highway are generally low, with an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,000 vehicles. This increases progressing north; within Thunder Bay the AADT peaks at 17,200 vehicles. Highway 61 also forms a small portion of the Lake Superior Circle Tour, a tourist route of highways following the shoreline of Lake Superior. To the south, the tour continues along Minnesota State Highway 61; to the north it continues along Highway 17 towards Sault Saint Marie.  History  The original bridge over the Pigeon River was known as The Outlaw. The road that would become Highway 61 was first constructed in 1916. The Pigeon River Timber Company had cleared lands surrounding the towns of Port Arthur and Fort William, but no road existed to connect to locations outside. A narrow wilderness trail reached as far as the Pigeon River, and was chosen as the route for the new road. The Department of Mines and Resources agreed to fund the project, and citizens proceeded to lay a new road as far as the river, beginning in 1913. This road was initially known as the \\"Scott Highway\\" after lumberman William Scott. On the opposite shore, Cook County and the State of Minnesota constructed a new road north from Grand Marais. The roads were completed by late 1916, but no bridge existed to connect them. In response, the Rotary Clubs of Port Arthur and Duluth met to discuss a solution. As an international crossing, any bridge over the river would require federal approval from both governments. Both sides agreed that the approval process would be too slow, and decided to construct the bridge regardless. \\"The Outlaw\\" bridge was opened by a travelling motorcade on August 18, 1917, finally permitting travel between Ontario and Minnesota. To the surprise of the Rotary Clubs, J. E. Whitson, Roads Commissioner of Northern Ontario, and Howard Ferguson, Minister of Lands, Forest and Mines, were present at the opening, and agreed to pay the $768,000 ($ in ) bridge cost. The bridge and the Canadian road approaching it fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Highways (now the Ministry of Transportation) on April 1, 1937, and the Scott Highway became Highway 61 on October 6. The Outlaw was rebuilt as a steel truss structure in 1934 following several accidents. The Outlaw was replaced by this truss bridge in 1934. It remained in place until the new crossing opened in 1964. By 1962, construction was underway to bypass the inland route of the highway as well as the bridge. This bypass opened on November 1, 1963; the American approach was rebuilt along the shore of Lake Superior, and a new bridge constructed over the river to the east. This bridge was opened on May 23, 1964. Highway 61 was realigned as a result; the former route was redesignated as Highway 593 on September 1, 1964. In 1963, Charles MacNaughton, minister of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to be built on the western edge of the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay). Construction began in the late 1960s and progressed rapidly. Following its completion by late 1970, Highway 61 was rerouted along it as far north as Arthur Street. The former route followed Chippewa Road, turned north on James Street and then east on Frederica Street. From there, it turned north along Ford Street and followed it and Kingsway to Highway 11 and Highway 17 at Arthur Street. This route was renumbered as Highway 61B; it remained in place into the 1990s, but was decommissioned by 1999. Beginning in 1991, Highway 61 was completely reconstructed south of Thunder Bay to the border in preparation for the 1995 World Nordic Ski Championships. This involved replacing eight bridges, improving sightlines, and adding five passing lanes and paved shoulders throughout the length of the highway. The highway was extended to the north on August 17, 2007, when the Shabaqua Highway opened, redirecting Highway 11 and Highway 17 off Arthur Street.

He is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote.Chuck Zerby, The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes, 2007, , p. 28 and passim Life It is thought that Richard Jugge was born in Waterbeach in Cambridgeshire and he was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. He was admitted a freeman of the Stationers' Company in 1541 and began to print the New Testament in English, dated 1550. Joseph Ames in Typographical Antiquities says he was \\"very curious, in his editions of both the Old and New Testament, bestowing not only a good letter, but many elegant initial letters and fine wooden cuts.\\" He was one of the original members of the Stationers' Company, of which he was chosen Warden in 1560, 1563 and 1566, and Master in 1568, 1569, 1573 and 1574. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he became Royal Printer conjointly with John Cawood. He survived Cawood for a few years, in which he enjoyed the privileges of the patent alone, but he discovered that this was a heavy undertaking. With all the other work that flowed into his printing house from the patent, he found difficulty in organizing the production of Bibles. An octavo Testament took him two years to complete, and whereas Richard Grafton and Edmund Whitchurch had issued seven folio Bibles in three years, Jugge managed only two in the same period. This rate of production was unsatisfactory to the Government and to the Church. After \\"long hearing and debating of grievances\\" Jugge was instructed to limit himself to the quarto Bible and to the Testament in sextodecimo. One of Jugge's printer's devices consisted of a massive architectural panel adorned with wreaths of fruit, and bearing in the centre an oval, within which is a pelican feeding her young. On the left of the oval stands a female figure, having a serpent twined round her right arm, who is called on the tablet beneath her Prudencia, and upon the left is another female figure with a balance and a sword, called Justicia. Jugge died in 1577, and his will was proved on 23 October that year. His business was carried on by his widow Joan Jugge [maiden name perhaps Joan Merrye],* who continued the business until at least 1584 printing under her own name, dying in 1588.Bell, Maureen. \\"Women in the English Book Trade 1557-1700\\" Leipziger Jahrbuch zur Buchgeschichte, 1996, , p. 36 John Jugge who was Richard's son, appears to have inherited the rights to some titles but never printed independently.

On Gurney's retirement as shorthand writer to the houses of parliament in 1872, the post was given to his nephew William Henry Gurney Salter. Gurney died at Tyndale Lodge, Wimbledon Common, on 12 August 1879, and was interred at the Norwood Cemetery. Works Gurney brought out popular commentaries on the Bible. The best known of these was The Annotated Paragraph Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments according to the authorised version, with explanatory Notes, Prefaces to the several Books, and an entirely new selection of references to parallel and illustrative Passages, two vols., London, 1850‚Äì60, published by the Religious Tract Society. It was successful, and widely praised. The notes were prepared under Gurney's supervision. Besides other bibles, Gurney published also The Revised English Bible, London, 1877, closely resembling the Revised Version (1885). The profits of his literary works he gave to the Religious Tract Society. Family Gurney married first Emma, daughter of E. Rawlings, and secondly, Harriet, daughter of J. Tritton, of Lombard Street.

It was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on November 19, 2003. The episode revolves around the religion and culture of Mormons, as a Mormon family moves to the town of South Park, and influences the beliefs of the family of character Stan Marsh. The story of Joseph Smith's founding of Mormonism and the origin of the Book of Mormon is told through a number of comedic 19th- century flashbacks, with a musical narration. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA in the United States. The episode evolved from personal experiences of creators Parker and Matt Stone, who grew up in Colorado. Growing up in Colorado both Stone and Parker often visited Utah, and both had Mormon classmates. The scene in which Stan is invited to dinner by the Mormon family was inspired by Parker's first girlfriend in high school, who was Mormon and invited him over for Family Home Evening. They found the religion ridiculous but hard to parody Mormons due to their good-natured attitudes. The new Mormon student Gary is voiced by South Park writer Kyle McCulloch, who grew up Mormon. The episode received positive reviews from television critics, and has been placed on \\"best-of\\" South Park lists. Parker found that younger audiences found the episode unfunny, but many of his Mormon friends found it hilarious. \\"All About Mormons\\" was released on DVD along with the rest of the seventh season on March 21, 2006. Parker and Stone later carried over many themes from the episode for their musical The Book of Mormon, which opened on Broadway in 2011. Plot A new family, the Harrisons, move into South Park, and their son Gary, stereotypically depicted as unusually perfect (achieving high grades, being state champion in sports, being perfectly polite, etc.), invokes the wrath of the other boys. Stan is drafted into the job of beating him up by the other children, but Gary's sheer politeness leads Stan to discover himself walking away with an invitation to dinner that night. Stan meets Gary's family, an overly friendly, loving, talented family (including a very articulate infant.) After dinner, the five- child, two-parent family has \\"Family Home Evening\\" where they play games, do performance art and read from the Book of Mormon. Stan is intrigued and confused by all this, and asks his parents about the Mormon family's beliefs. Randy (his father) concludes that they must be religious fanatics attempting to brainwash Stan, and heads over to confront Mr. Harrison and beat him up. Instead, he too finds himself quelled by the family's perfection and politeness, and in the end, actually decides to convert to Mormonism himself. The next day, Kenny, Cartman and Kyle cruelly mock Stan for hanging around with Gary and his family, accusing Stan of going on a date with Gary. When the Harrisons and Gary show up, the three children walk off lying about going to \\"put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter\\". Throughout the episode, characters ask questions about Mormonism, and the story then breaks off to a sub-story about Joseph Smith and the founding of the religion. For satirical purposes, the show deviates from the original accounts of Mormonism's founding by adding extra details to stories originally left vague (e.g. the precise location where Martin Harris lost the only transcript of the Book of Lehi given to him by Joseph Smith); furthermore, during the narration, an upbeat tune plays in the background, with a choral \\"Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum\\" following the lyrical lines of the song. When skeptic Lucy Harris appears in the sub-story, the chorus changes to \\"Smart, smart, smart, smart, smart\\", and it becomes clear that the voices are actually singing \\"Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\\" after the specifics of Smith's story. The show asserts flaws in the religion's founding, which especially concern Stan (for example, that Joseph Smith offered no proof to the general public of finding the golden plates, and that he claimed to have translated from a slightly different plate after the first translation was lost while in the possession of Martin Harris). Stan ends up shouting at the Mormons that they are ridiculous for believing in it without proof; they smile and patiently explain that it's a matter of faith, while Stan argues that it should be a matter of empirical evidence. He further lashes out at them for acting unusually nice all the time, claiming it blindsides stupid people like his father into believing in Mormonism (to which Randy Marsh responds with a determined \\"Yeah!\\"). Stan's anger doesn't upset anyone in the Mormon family other than Gary, who confronts Stan and the other boys the next day, pointing out that he believes his religion does not need to be factually true, but it still supports good family values and helping the poor. Gary condemns their bigotry and ignorance in language that is normal for the main characters but extremely surprising and powerful coming from Gary. He walks away, leaving the boys in utter shock. The episode ends as Cartman, with a new-found respect for Gary, says \\"Damn, that kid is cool, huh?\\". Production The episode was written and directed by South Park co-creator Trey Parker. The character of the new Mormon student Gary is voiced by South Park writer Kyle McCulloch, who himself grew up Mormon. Growing up in Colorado, Parker and Stone knew a lot of Mormon people, and Parker's high school ex-girlfriend was a Mormon, whose family he has visited while they held Family Home Evening.Trey Parker and Matt Stone talk at The Amazing Meeting 5, in January 2007. Through these experiences, Parker learned a number of things about the religion, and did more research for his film Orgazmo, in which he played the Mormon main character. Reception Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun, a tabloid Australian newspaper, highlighted the episode among \\"Top Choice\\" picks in television. Chris Quinn of the San Antonio Express-News placed the episode at number 7 on his list of \\"Top 10 Most Offensive South Park Episodes and Therefore, Maybe The Best, List\\". In 2013, fans voted the episode as the best of the 7th season.https://web.archive.org/web/20130616050517/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer- of-south-park/season-7 The episode was used as an exhibit in discussing Mormonism in popular culture by Utah Valley State College religious studies professor Kelli Potter in a presentation titled \\"The Americanization of Mormonism Reflected in Pop Culture\\".

The MUP has been brought to 128 precincts island-wide, benefitting 131,000 households. History In 1992, the government experimented with the concept of upgrading HDB flats while they were still being occupied on 6 precincts in a Demonstration Phase. These precincts were in Marine Parade, Kim Keat, Telok Blangah, Ang Mo Kio, Lorong Lew Lian and Clementi. The Demonstration Phase was a success, and was hence, expanded island-wide. Under the MUP, improvements are carried out to the precinct's surroundings, the blocks, as well as within each individual dwelling unit. The programme was absorbed into Home Improvement Programme in 2007. The priority of HDB upgrading programme was linked to support by electoral wards, as stated by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, \\"by linking the priority of upgrading to electoral support, we focus the minds of voters on the link between upgrading and the people whose policies make it possible.

Sadhya is typically served as a traditional dish for Onam, the state festival of Kerala. Overview Valla sadhya A typical Sadhya can have about 24‚Äì28 dishes served as a single course. In cases where it is a much larger one it can have over 64 or more items, such as the Sadhya for Aranmula Boatrace (Valla Sadhya). During a traditional Sadhya celebration people are seated cross-legged on mats. Food is eaten with the right hand, without cutlery. The fingers are cupped to form a ladle. The main dish is plain boiled rice, served along with other dishes collectively called Kootan (‡¥ï‡µÇ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥æ‡¥®‡µç‚Äç) which include curries like parippu, sambar, rasam, pulisseri and others like kaalan, avial, thoran, olan, pachadi, kichadi, koottukari, erissery, mango pickle, pulinji, naranga achaar (lime pickle), as well as papadam, plantain chips, sharkara upperi, banana, plain curd and buttermilk. The buttermilk is typically served near the end of the meal. The traditional dessert called payasam served at the end of the meal is of many kinds and usually three or more are served. Some of the varieties are Paal Ada, Ada Pradhaman, Paripu pradhaman, chakkapradhaman, etc. The 'Kootan' are made with different vegetables and have different flavours; some say the reason for including so many dishes in the Sadhya is to ensure that the diners will like at least a few dishes. A sadhya served for Onam The dishes are served on specific places on the banana leaf in specific order. For example, the pickles are served on the top left corner and the banana on the bottom left corner, which helps the waiters to easily identify and decide on offering additional servings. The most common ingredients in all the dishes are rice, vegetables, coconut and coconut oil as they are abundant in Kerala. Coconut milk is used in some dishes and coconut oil is used for frying and also as an ingredient in others. There are variations in the menu depending on the place and religion. Some communities, especially those in the northern part of Kerala, include non-vegetarian dishes in the sadhya. Although custom was to use traditional and seasonal vegetables indigenous to Kerala or South West Coast of India, it has become common practice to include vegetables such as carrots, pineapples, beans in the dishes. Tradition has it that onion and garlic are not typically used in the sadhya. Conventionally, the meal may be followed by vettila murukkan, chewing of betel leaf with lime and arecanut. This helps digestion of the meal and also cleanses the palate. Preparations Pachadi being prepared, which is sometimes used as an ingredient in sadhya The sadhya is usually served for lunch, although a lighter version is served for dinner too. Preparations begin the night before, and the dishes are prepared before ten o' clock in the morning on the day of the celebration. On many occasions, sadhya is served on tables, as people no longer find it convenient to sit on the floor. Sourcing of items/ingredients for Sadhya is an elaborate and careful process to ensure quality. The lighting of the fire to prepare the sadhya is done after a prayer to Agni and the first serving is offered on a banana leaf in front of a lighted nilavilallku as an offering to god. Traditionally, the people of the neighborhood spent the night helping the cooks in cooking. They also volunteer to serve the food for the hosts to the guests. This involves a fair amount of social interaction which help build rapport with the neighbors. Sadhya is served in Pankthi (Sanskrit) ‚Äì panthi in Malayalam ‚Äì meaning in lines or rounds where sets of people are served in sitting lines, on the floor earlier, now on benches and desks. There can be many Pankti's depending upon total size of the crowd and the capacity of the place. The hosts normally sits only during the last pankti. The host will eat at the last and will go around every pankti/panti to greet the guests and to ensure that they are satisfied. In a Sadhya, the meals are served on a banana leaf. The leaf is folded and closed once the meal is finished. In some instances, closing the leaf toward you communicates satisfaction with the meal, while folding it away from oneself signifies that the meal can be improved. However, the direction the leaf is folded in can have different meanings in various parts of India. The Central Travancore-style sadhya is renowned to be the most disciplined and tradition-bound. There is usually an order followed in serving the dishes, starting from the chips and pickles first. However, different styles and approaches to making and serving the dishes are adopted in various parts of Kerala depending on local preferences. Typical ingredients The items include: Sadhya items ready to be served. Clockwise from top: paayasam (in stainless mug), bittergourd thoran, aviyal, kaalan, lime pickle, saambaar, buttermilk, boiled rice in center * Rice: It is the main item in a sadhya. It is always the Kerala red rice (semi-polished parboiled brown ) which is used for the Sadhya. Kerala matta rice is sometimes used. * Parippu: A thick curry lentil dish eaten with rice, papadum and ghee. * Sambar: A thick gravy made of lentils, tamarind, vegetables like drumsticks, tomato, etc., and flavored with asafoetida. * Rasam: A watery dish made of tamarind, tomatoes, and spices like black pepper, asafoetida, coriander, chili pepper, etc. It is very spicy in taste and aids in digestion. However, in some regions Rasam is not counted as part of Sadhya. * Avial: A dense mixture of various vegetables and coconut, it is seasoned with curry leaves and coconut oil. * Kaalan: Made of curd, coconut, and any one vegetable like \\"nendran\\" plantain or a tuber-like yam. It is very thick and more sour, and typically can last for a longer period owing to the lower water content. * Olan: A light dish, prepared of white gourd or black peas, coconut milk, and ginger seasoned with coconut oil. * Koottukari: Vegetables like banana or yam cooked with chickpeas, coconut and black pepper. * Erissery: A thick curry made from pumpkin, black-eyed peas and coconut. * Pachadi: Sour curry made of curd and usually cucumber or sliced ash gourd cooked in coconut ground with mustard seeds and seasoned with saut√©ed mustard seeds and curry leaves. In Tamil Nadu, this dish is known as Pachadi. It is somewhat similar to a Raita. * Sweet Pachadi: A sweet form of Pachadi, made with pineapple, pumpkin or grapes in curd. The gravy masala comprises coconut ground with cumin seeds and green chillies. Due to its sweetness, it is also called Madhura (sweet) curry in some places. * Pulisseri: A sour, yellow-coloured thin curry made with slightly soured yoghurt and cucumber. A sweet variant called 'Mambazha Puliseri' replaces cucumber with a combination of ripe mangoes and jaggery. * Injipuli: A sweet pickle made of ginger, tamarind, green chilies, and jaggery, also called Puli-inji. * Thoran: A dish of saut√©ed vegetables such as peas, green beans, raw jackfruit, carrots, or cabbage (usually) with grated coconut. * Achaar: Spicy pickles of raw mango (Mango pickle), lemon, lime, (Narangakari) etc. * Pappadam: Made with lentil flour, it is crispy and can be eaten as an appetizer. * Sharkara upperi: banana chips with jaggery * Kaaya Varuthathu: banana chips * Banana: A ripe banana is often served with the Sadhya to be eaten with the dessert, Payasam. * Sambharam, also referred to as moru: A drink made from salted buttermilk with green chilli, ginger and curry leaves, it is drunk to improve digestion and is typically served near the end of the meal. These side dishes are followed by desserts like Prathaman and Payasams. There is a strict order and placement of ingredients on the banana leaf. Aranmula Valla Sadhya is the most celebrated one with over 64 items served in the traditional way. Prathaman Prathaman is a sweet dish in the form of a thick liquid; similar to payasam, but with more variety in terms of ingredients and more elaborately made. It is made with white sugar or jaggery to which coconut milk is added. The main difference between a prathaman and a payasam is that the former uses coconut milk, while the liquid versions of payasam use cow's milk. * Palada prathaman is made of flakes of cooked rice, milk, and sugar. * Pazha prathaman is made of cooked \\"nendra\\" plantain or banana in jaggery and coconut milk. * Gothambu prathaman is made of broken wheat. * Parippu prathaman is made of green gram. * Chakka prathaman is made of jackfruit. * Kadala prathaman is made from black gram.

It is a collection of 130 algebraic problems giving numerical solutions of determinate equations (those with a unique solution) and indeterminate equations. Summary Equations in the book are presently called Diophantine equations. The method for solving these equations is known as Diophantine analysis. Most of the Arithmetica problems lead to quadratic equations. In Book 3, Diophantus solves problems of finding values which make two linear expressions simultaneously into squares or cubes. In book 4, he finds rational powers between given numbers. He also noticed that numbers of the form 4n + 3 cannot be the sum of two squares. Diophantus also appears to know that every number can be written as the sum of four squares. If he did know this result (in the sense of having proved it as opposed to merely conjectured it), his doing so would be truly remarkable: even Fermat, who stated the result, failed to provide a proof of it and it was not settled until Joseph Louis Lagrange proved it using results due to Leonhard Euler. Arithmetica was originally written in thirteen books, but the Greek manuscripts that survived to the present contain no more than six books. In 1968, Fuat Sezgin found four previously unknown books of Arithmetica at the shrine of Imam RezƒÅ in the holy Islamic city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran. The four books are thought to have been translated from Greek to Arabic by Qusta ibn Luqa (820‚Äì912). Norbert Schappacher has written: > [The four missing books] resurfaced around 1971 in the Astan Quds Library in > Meshed (Iran) in a copy from 1198 AD. It was not catalogued under the name > of Diophantus (but under that of Qusta ibn Luqa) because the librarian was > apparently not able to read the main line of the cover page where > Diophantus‚Äôs name appears in geometric Kufi calligraphy.

Lineage  Owain was the eldest son of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and the grandson of Llywelyn the Great. He was imprisoned together with his father in Criccieth Castle in 1239 by his uncle Dafydd ap Llywelyn, and accompanied his father to England two years later when Dafydd was forced to hand Gruffudd over to King Henry III of England. In 1244 Gruffudd was killed when a makeshift rope broke as he attempted to escape from the Tower of London. This freed Dafydd ap Llywelyn's hand as King Henry could no longer use Gruffudd against him, and war broke out between him and King Henry in the spring of 1244. Owain meanwhile had been freed by Henry after his father's death in the hope that he would start a civil war in Gwynedd, but he remained at Chester, so that when Dafydd died unexpectedly in February 1246 without leaving an heir, his brother Llywelyn, who had supported his uncle against the king, had the advantage of being on the spot.  Treaty of Woodstock  Owain and Llywelyn came to terms with King Henry, but were restricted by the terms of the Treaty of Woodstock in 1247 to Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, the part of Gwynedd west of the River Conwy, which was divided between them. Gwynedd Is Conwy, east of the river, was taken over by the king, who gave it to his son, Edward. Though initially paying homage to the English, Owain and Llywelyn soon broke with Henry III in protest over the ruthless raids being conducted on the Welsh borders.  The Battle of Bryn Derwin  The third brother, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, came of age soon afterwards, and King Henry accepted his homage and announced his intention of giving him a part of the already much reduced Gwynedd. Llywelyn refused to accept this, and Owain and Dafydd formed an alliance against him. This led to the Battle of Bryn Derwin in June 1255. Llywelyn defeated Owain and Dafydd and captured them, thereby becoming sole ruler of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy. The medieval Welsh chronicle Brut y Tywysogion described the struggle thus: > In those days great strife was bred at the instigation of the Devil between > the sons of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, Namely Owain Goch and Dafydd on the one > side, and Llywelyn on the other. And then Llywelyn and his men, trusting in > God, awaited, unafraid on Bryn Derwin the fierce coming of his brothers, and > a mighty host along with them. And before the end of one hour Owain Goch was > captured and Dafydd fled, after many of his host had been slain.  Imprisonment and release With his brothers out of the way, Llywelyn proceeded to extend Gwynedd's territory until it encompassed much of the rest of Wales, in the process claiming the title of Prince of Wales. Owain was imprisoned again, and remained in prison until 1277. Dolbadarn Castle in Snowdonia, where Owain is thought to have been held captive In a contemporary poem of the 13th century, court poet Hywel Foel ap Griffri laments Owain's captivity, describing him in the opening line as: G≈µr ysydd yn nh≈µr yn hir westai (a man who is in the tower, long a guest). It is unclear where Owain was imprisoned, but some scholars believe he was kept in Dolbadarn Castle near Llanberis. Wherever he was kept, Llywelyn reluctantly released Owain in 1277 under the terms of the Treaty of Aberconwy, after some 20 years of captivity. Upon being released, Owain retired to his estate in north-west Wales and never again mounted a serious challenge to his brother Llywelyn's rule. He is thought to have died c. 1282.

The lands immediately around the commercial centre of Funchal were quickly acquired and put into service for cultivation of subsistence crops. As with the other settlements in the Portuguese Empire, these settlements eventually formed from communities of living in the shadow of small chapels that dotted the landscape. The same was true for S√£o Martinho: a small artesanal business and chapel constituted the first buildings in this region, owned by Afonso Anes, who was responsible for guiding the influencing development, becoming a parish on 3 March 1579. Much later a new church was a formal church constructed, by the 19th century. The establishment of an Administrative Code in 1878, defined the creation of a level of government below the municipality, giving rise to the civil parish system that coincided with the older ecclesiastical parishes. On 23 June 1916, by decree law 621, the parish of S√£o Martinho was created.

He had been apprenticed to Richard Harrison in 1560, but that printer died about January 1563; though definitive evidence is lacking, Bynneman likely served the remainder of his apprenticeship with Reyner Wolfe. He became one of that select group of printers to whom the Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, extended his patronage. Through the good offices of Leicester and Sir Christopher Hatton, in 1580 Bynneman obtained a privilege to print \\"all dictionaries in all tongues, all chronicles and histories whatsoever.\\" He had previously printed and published with privileges for \\"bookes\\" [i.e. proclamations] dealing with the lottery as well as a variety of works seemingly secured after Matthew Parker wrote to William Cecil in 1569 on his behalf.

In addition to printing works by noted authors such as Edmund Spenser, Gabriel Harvey, George Turberville, and others, Bynneman printed the first Welsh New Testament translated directly from Greek in 1567 for publisher Humphrey Toy, along with the first Welsh edition of the Book of Common Prayer.

It has not been in communion with any of the Oriental Orthodox churches since a 2015 decision to return to an independent status. The present British Orthodox Church derives from the consecration of a French former Dominican priest Jules Ferrette (1828-1904), who in the year 1866 was consecrated as Bishop of Iona by the Syriac Orthodox Church's Bishop of Emesa Boutros ibn Salmo Mesko (1799-1894) with the purpose of re-establishing Oriental Orthodoxy in the West. In February 1994 a delegation headed by Metropolitan Seraphim of Glastonbury, representing the Orthodox Church of the British Isles, was invited to Egypt by Pope Shenouda III, of the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Coptic Orthodox Pope & Patriarch of Alexandria, Pope Shenouda III met the delegation and discussed their dogma (they being of Orthodox origin), and the matter of their uniting with the Coptic Church. On 19 March 1994, at the \\"Synod of Soho\\" which met at the House of St Barnabas-in-Soho, the clergy unanimously supported proceeding towards full union with the Alexandrian patriarchate. In further detailed discussions with Pope Shenouda and senior members of the Holy Synod, held in Cairo in April, May and June in Cairo again on 2‚Äì11 April and 28 May-5 June, details of the protocol determining the relationship of the Orthodox Church of the British Isles to the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria were agreed. Pope Shenouda decided not to re-ordain Abba Seraphim but to recognise his orders and received him by economia on 4 June 1994. Although his episcopal orders were fully recognised, Pope Shenouda decided to ordain him as a bishop in order to bring all the clergy within the Coptic line of apostolic succession. He had been enthroned as Metropolitan of Glastonbury following the death of his predecessor in 1979, but now he would also be ordained as a metropolitan of the patriarchate. In the Coptic Orthodox tradition, metropolitans are actually ordained, as the senior episcopal rank. On 19 June 1994, on the Feast of Pentecost in the Great Cathedral of St Mark in Cairo, he received these ordinations at the hands of Pope Shenouda assisted by 63 metropolitans and bishops who constituted the Holy Synod. On 4 October 2015 the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate, in response to a request from the British Orthodox Church, \\"in the same spirit with which this union came into being\\", agreed to the British Orthodox Church returning to its pre-1994 status \\"in fulfilment to what it sees as its current mission in the light of the developments and changing dynamics of the Middle East and Britain\\". The British Orthodox website spoke of it \\"amicably returning to its original status in order to fulfil its mission more effectively\\".http://britishorthodox.org/5330/joint-announcement-from-the- coptic-orthodox-church-in-the-united-kingdom-and-the-british-orthodox-church- of-the-british-isles/ Joint Announcement from the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom and the British Orthodox Church of the British Isles, 5 October 2015 This resulted in the British Orthodox Church returning to a non- canonical status, outside of communion with any Orthodox or other Church. Metropolitan Seraphim of Glastonbury is the metropolitan of the Metropolis of Glastonbury and primate of the British Orthodox Church. In January 2019 it was announced that he would be known as His Beatitude Patriarch Seraphim. Metropolitinate Abba Seraphim (William Henry Hugo Newman-Norton) (born 1948), Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of Glastonbury VIIth British Patriarch and Primate of the British Orthodox Church. He was a full member of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria from 1994 to the church's autocephaly in 2015. Since January 2019 he uses the title His Beatitude Abba Seraphim but is no longer in communion with any Orthodox or other communities. The Glastonbury metropolitanate has two other bishops consecrated by Abba Seraphim. Origins The British Orthodox Church originated in the consecration of a Frenchman, Jules Ferrette, as a bishop to serve independently in the West, by the Mutran Boutros (later the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch) at Homs (Emesa) on 2 June 1866. Ferrette was born in France of Protestant parents, but became a Roman Catholic and was ordained a priest. He came to leave the Roman Catholic Church and associated with the Irish Presbyterian Mission in Damascus. While in Syria as a Protestant missionary he was consecrated a bishop and travelled to Britain where he hoped to be able to bring about Christian unity based on the Orthodox orders he had received. After two years he abandoned his missionary efforts in Britain and moved to the United States of America. He later retired to Switzerland. He had gained a few followers in Britain during this short period but had been unable to establish a stable church. An Anglican priest, Richard Williams Morgan (1815-1889), received episcopal consecration as Mar Pelagius, Hierarch or Caerleon by Mar Julius Ferrette before he left for the United States of America, and to have subsequently became associated with by the Order of Corporate Reunion. He continued to serve as an Anglican priest while also leading the small community of the Ancient British Church. He consecrated a former presbyter of the Reformed Episcopal Church, Charles Isaac Stevens (1835-1917), as a bishop in 1879, who later was styled as Patriarch Mar Theophilus and the documented history of the antecedents of the British Orthodox Church begin from this point. In 1890, Stevens consecrated an Armenian, Leon Checkemian (1848-1920), as a bishop for the Ancient British Church. He had been a priest of the Armenian Catholic Church in Asia Minor before immigrating to the British Isles where he was consecrated a bishop for the Free Protestant Episcopal Church. In the same year he also formed the United Armenian Catholic Church as a non-Catholic alternative for Armenians. He also joined the Church of Ireland and was licensed by them to minister as a cleric. In 1897 he united his Free Protestant Church with the Ancient British Church, while preserving the independence of his United Armenian Catholic Church, and with the Nazarene Episcopal Church of James Martin (1843-1919). In 1900 Checkemian passed the control of the Free Protestant Episcopal Church to Stevens, and it remained a union of the Ancient British Church, of which Stevens was considered the second Patriarch, and the Free Protestant Church, of which he was also the primus. On his death in 1917, Martin took over as third patriarch and primus of the two bodies, using the name Mar Jacobus I Antipas. On the death of Martin in 1919, Andrew Charles Albert McLagen (Mar Andries) became patriarch of the Ancient British Church and primus of the Free Protestant Episcopal church holding those positions from 1919 until his death in 1928. The Ancient British Church and the Free Protestant Episcopal Church were only separated when Herbert James Monanzi-Heard (1871-1948), the successor of McLagan, was succeeded by William Hall in the Free Protestant Episcopal Church in 1939, and was succeeded by Hugh George de Willmott Newman (1905-1979) in the Ancient British Church in 1945. Newman held the position of Patriarch of the Ancient British Church, under various other names, until being succeeded in turn by William Henry Hugo Newman-Norton, as Mar Seraphim in 1979. Name before 1994 In 1970 the name of the church was changed to the Orthodox Church of the British Isles at the suggestion of Bishop Jean Kovalevsky, primate of the Orthodox Catholic Church of France, as part of an increasing desire to seek union with one of the canonical Orthodox churches. Relationship with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria Over the years the British Orthodox Church lost touch with its Eastern origins, but in 1994 under the leadership of the present bishop, discussions with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria bore fruit and the church was reunited with the Oriental Orthodox churches from which it had come. On the feast of Pentecost in 1994, at Saint Mark's Cathedral in Cairo, Abba Seraphim was ordained as metropolitan by Pope Shenouda III, and the British Orthodox Church became a constituent of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate. The British Orthodox Church comprises five locations in the British Isles where services are conducted. All its services are in English and it venerates the Orthodox saints of the British Isles and those of the wider Orthodox Church. It uses the ancient Liturgy of Saint James as its usual liturgy, together with all the traditional services of the Coptic Orthodox Church, such as the morning and evening \\"Raising of Incense\\". The British Orthodox Church is a small community, and since 2015 has a policy of \\"concentrating on existing parishes\\" rather than establishing new missions.Charity Commission, British Orthodox Church Accounts 2015, Charity Commission, London, 31 December 2015. Continuing church after 1994 In 1994, much of the United Kingdom branch of the church followed Metropolitan Seraphim into formal union within the Coptic Orthodox Church, thus forming the British Orthodox Church. However, in 1995, a remnant of remaining bishops elected Mar Mael I (Paul Eduard de Fournier de Brescia) as patriarch. Mar Mael remained in office until his death in July 2014. The French and other members who did not join the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria adopted the name L'Eglise Orthodoxe Celtique (the Celtic Orthodox Church - officially the Celtic Apostolic Church), thus indicating that its jurisdiction covered the area of the former Celtic missions. In 1997/1998, several of the former Celtic parishes of the newly formed British Orthodox church left the Coptic church and returned to their mother church, being received by Mar Mael I into the Celtic Orthodox Church. Return to independence Following 21 years of unity with the Oriental Coptic Orthodox Church, a statement was released on 5 October 2015 stating the decision of the British Orthodox Church to return to its pre-1994 status of independence. In so doing, this ended the autonomous status of the church under the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. On this date the small British Orthodox Church ceased to be in communion with any of the ancient Orthodox churches. On 29 October 2017, Metropolitan Seraphim, acting solus, consecrated Father David Seeds as Bishop David of Priddy. On 23 February 2019, Patriarch Seraphim, acting with Bishop David of Priddy, consecrated Father James Maskery as His Eminence Abba James, Archbishop Titular of Caerleon-upon-Usk and Mafrian of the British Orthodox Church. Mafrian is a title used in the Syrian Orthodox Church for the Catholicos of the East, and the primate of the church in the Sassanid Empire, now Iran and Iraq. The clergy of the British Orthodox Church now consists of one patriarch, two bishops, one priest and one deacon. Publications Through the church press it publishes the Glastonbury Review, the only English language journal committed to regular reporting about the activities of the Oriental Orthodox churches and it has also begun to republish some important theological works.

Green Arrow was withdrawn from British Railways service in August 1962, and selected for preservation within the national collection, it was restored at Doncaster Works. With work completed in April 1963, it was followed by almost ten years of storage, during which it was moved several times. A transfer from Doncaster to Hellifield occurred in October 1964; the locomotive was moved to Wigston in 1967 - this was intended to be the final temporary home, since it was intended that Green Arrow would become one of the permanent exhibits in a Municipal Museum which was proposed for the nearby city of Leicester. However, before the museum was ready, demolition of Wigston locomotive depot was scheduled, and the locomotive was sent south to the Preston Park shops of the Pullman Car Company in September 1970. The National Railway Museum (NRM) was then being planned, and in November 1971 Green Arrow was selected for the National Collection, items from which would form the main display in the NRM. The locomotive was again moved, this time to Norwich depot in January 1972, where it was returned to working order; the first trial trip, to Ely, was on 28 March 1973. It then commenced a series of runs at the head of special trains, before being moved to Carnforth on 2 July 1973. In September 1979, Green Arrow headed The Centenary Express, as part of an exhibition tour of the country organised by Travellers Fare to celebrate the centenary of on-train catering.

It is the first part of a two- parter, which concludes in the following episode \\"Probably.\\" The story links some of the events and characters of the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut into the animated series. The episode is rated TV-MA in the United States. In the episode, the boys become obsessed with religion after a sermon about hell scares them. Meanwhile, Saddam returns to Hell and tries to dispose of Satan's new boyfriend. Plot Frightened into piety by Father Maxi's fire-and-brimstone sermon, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny begin to attend Sunday school classes with a nun named Sister Anne, who teaches them about Communion and confession. Issues arise when the children begin to ask questions regarding their classmates Kyle, who is Jewish, and Timmy, who is disabled and can say little more than his own name. The priest explains that both will go to Hell if they do not confess their sins. Later, in the confessional, Father Maxi tries to choke Cartman after he unwittingly confesses all the pranks he has played on the priest. Cartman tells the other kids that he has felt God's angry hand, which scares them even more. Meanwhile, in Hell, Satan and the people of Hell sing The Hukilau Song (featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tiny Tim, Mao Zedong, Diana, Princess of Wales, Adolf Hitler, among many others). Satan is torn between two lovers: Chris, an overly sensitive man he is living with (voiced by Dian Bachar), and Saddam Hussein, Satan's emotionally abusive ex, whom he had killed at the end of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Satan is surprised to see Saddam, though Saddam points out the obvious logic: \\"Yeah, you killed me. Where was I gonna go, Detroit?\\" It's apparent that Satan is still attracted to Saddam, and he struggles to choose between him and Chris. Chris invites Saddam over for dinner. Back in South Park, the boys, frightened of dying without having confessed all their sins, are rushing to church when Kenny is hit by a bus. When they arrive at the church, they discover Father Maxi copulating with a woman in the confessional. A brunette woman with glasses runs away and shortly after Father Maxi is on his knees begging forgiveness then yells \\"Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell!\\" The boys, horrified at the priest's blatant sinfulness and hypocrisy, decide that they will have to save everyone themselves. The episode ends with Cartman using a bullhorn and a stereotypical, exaggerated Southern preacher's accent on a street corner, directing a large group of children to the creation of a new religious movement. Reception IGN rated the episode 9/10, stating \\"It's also one of the better religious satires the show has done.\\" They comment that the funniest element is the love triangle between Satan, Saddam Hussein and Chris, and conclude that the episode is an example of \\"some of the most scathing commentary on social institutions there is.\\" References External links * \\"Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?\\" Full episode at South Park Studios * \\"Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios The Devil in fiction Television episodes about demons Television episodes set in hell South Park (season 4) episodes Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler Cultural depictions of Frank Sinatra Cultural depictions of Diana, Princess of Wales Cultural depictions of Mao Zedong Cultural depictions of Saddam Hussein South Park episodes in multiple parts ","title":"Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?"},{"id":"1777643","text":"Jim Pollock (born July 8, 1930) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada.

His parents owned and operated a local grocery store. He grew up helping with the grocery business and working in the Tuchscherer brewery. Nicknamed \\"Dutch\\", he received his early education from the Ursuline nuns at the parochial school, and excelled academically and athletically during high school. He attended Carroll College in Helena, majoring in chemistry and graduating cum laude in 1943. He considered pursuing a career as a chemical engineer or as a fighter pilot for the United States Air Force. However, he was persuaded by Father Bernard Topel, his spiritual director and mathematics professor at Carroll who later became Bishop of Spokane, to enter the priesthood. He began his studies at St. Edward Seminary in Kenmore, Washington, in the fall of 1943. Priesthood Hunthausen was ordained a priest by Bishop Joseph Gilmore on June 1, 1946. He returned to Carroll College, where he served as a professor of chemistry (1946‚Äì57) and a football and basketball coach (1953‚Äì57).

In 1982, Hunthausen withheld half of his income tax to protest the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the Trident missile program which had a base nearby, in Puget Sound.

Church investigation As a result of the complaints surrounding his alleged deviations from church doctrine, in 1983 the Vatican authorized Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to launch an investigation. Archbishop (later Cardinal) James Hickey of Washington, DC, was named apostolic visitor to the Archdiocese of Seattle. Hickey's delegation met with Hunthausen and others to investigate his administrative and pastoral practices. The investigation concluded that Hunthausen had exercised \\"weak doctrinal leadership\\" in a number of areas, including allowing children to receive the sacrament of Communion without first having received the sacrament of penance.Fromherz, Frank. \\"Raymond Hunthausen, retired archbishop of Seattle, dies at age 96\\", National Catholic Reporter, July 22, 2018 Donald Wuerl, later Bishop of Pittsburgh and Archbishop of Washington, was controversially named an auxiliary bishop with special powers. According to Thomas Bokenkotter, \\"A resolution of the affair was finally announced by the Vatican in April after it accepted the report of a commission that recommended that Hunthausen's authority be restored and a coadjutor bishop be appointed.Chandler, Russell. \\"Pope Restores Full Powers to Hunthausen\\", The Los Angeles Times, May 27, 1987 Hunthausen stoutly maintains that his archdiocese has remained fundamentally the same and was never in violation of Vatican doctrine; nor has he had to alter the general direction of his ministry or compromise his liberal beliefs.\\"A Concise History of the Catholic Church, Rev. and exp. ed.

Archbishop Hunthausen is remembered most for his support of the poor and disenfranchised. He was also a great advocate for the youth and encouraged better catechesis in Catholic parishes and Catholic parochial schools despite waning enrollment. In 1985, he helped establish the Institute for Theological Studies at Seattle University, which in 1996 evolved into the School of Theology and Ministry. Retirement and Death Archbishop Hunthausen retired on August 21, 1991, his 70th birthday and resided near Helena, Montana, with his brother, Father Jack Hunthausen. He continued to hear confessions once a week in East Helena, and led retreats in the Helena diocese. As of October 2011, Hunthausen was the last living American bishop to have attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. On July 22, 2018, he died in his home in Helena at the age of 96. He is the second archbishop interred in the crypt at St. James Cathedral.

No. 3 Group was first formed on 10 May 1918 as part of South-Eastern Area. No. 13 Group RAF was merged into 3 Group on 18 October 1919. Group Captain U J D Bourke took command on 30 November 1919. The Group was disbanded on 31 August 1921. The 1930s and the Second World War Reformed in 1923, 3 Group was disbanded on 12 April 1926 at RAF Spitalgate by renumbering it No. 23 (Training) Group. The Group was reformed at Andover, Wiltshire on 1 May 1936, under Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair.An Introduction to Bomber Command No. 3 Group, accessed 30 May 2008 Ten months later Group HQ moved to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, a direct result of the Air Ministry's decision to form two new bomber groups and reorganise its existing groups. No. 3 Group was initially equipped with the ungainly Vickers Virginia and Handley Page Heyford, which was the RAF's last biplane heavy bomber. With the arrival of the then revolutionary twin engined Vickers Wellington it was decided that No. 3 Group would be tasked with introducing the type into front line service. The first squadron in Bomber Command to be equipped was No. 99 Squadron RAF based at Mildenhall, on 10 October 1938. Air Commodore A A B Thomson, Playfair's successor, was killed on 8 August 1939 while viewing the bombing up of a Vickers Wellington of No. 115 Squadron RAF.An Introduction to Bomber Command No. 3 Group.

By September 1939 the entire group (totalling six front line squadrons and two reserve squadrons) was fully equipped with an all-Wellington force totalling over 100 aircraft located at five East Anglian airfields. 3 Group continued to be primarily based in East Anglia for the rest of WWII. 3 Group's first wartime operations were attacks against German warships at Wilhelmshaven and Brunsb√ºttel. Group HQ moved to Harraton House, Exning, Suffolk, in March 1940. On 2 April 1940, two squadrons were temporarily transferred to RAF Coastal Command and advanced bases in Northern Scotland, and they had hardly settled in before the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway.Philip Moyes, 'Bomber Squadrons of the Royal Air Force,' MacDonald, London, 1964, p. 334, via Royal Air Force, Bomber Command 60th Anniversary: No. 3 Group .

The squadrons went into action immediately and on 11/12 April one of them (115 Sqn) became the first RAF unit to bomb deliberately a mainland target (Stavanger Airport, Sola) during the Second World War. In September 1940 3 Group Bomber Command assumed administrative control of No. 419 Flight, the first of the Royal Air Force Special Duties Service units. The group provided administrative support for all the Special Duties squadrons til the end of the war.

Brown was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. NFL career =Pittsburgh Steelers= Brown was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round (26th overall pick) of the 1975 NFL Draft.

He appeared in 159 games for the Seahawks, all of them as the team's starting right cornerback. In November 1984, the Seahawks established an NFL record with four interception returns (including returns by Brown of 95 and 58 yards) for touchdowns in a single game against the Kansas City Chiefs. After the 1984 season, Brown was selected to play in the Pro Bowl and was also selected by the Associated Press as a second-team All-NFL player.

During his tenure, Texas Tech defeated Clemson 55-15 in the 2002 Tangerine Bowl, beat Navy 38-14 in the 2003 Houston Bowl, beat California in the 45-31 in the 2004 Holiday Bowl and lost to Alabama 13-10 in the 2006 Cotton Bowl Classic. Brown was married and had two sons, Aaron and Sterling, with his wife, Rhonda. On January 10, 2006, Brown died in Lubbock after suffering an apparent heart attack while playing basketball with his son, just six days shy of his 53rd birthday.

It was the site of an early attempt at British settlement, but now exists only as a remote series of ruins. Nautical Chart of Port Essington, showing the Victoria settlement, surveyed by Charles Tyers in 1839 Settlement In August 1618 Lenaert Jacobszoon, the captain of the Dutch East India Company vessel Mauritius, marked the point on the entrance to what was later called Port Essington, on the Dutch charts as Kape Schildpad (Cape Turtle). In the early 19th century, the British government became interested in establishing a settlement on Australia's northern coastline in order to facilitate trade with Asia. Port Essington was named on 23 April 1818 by Phillip Parker King in 'as a tribute of my respect for the memory of my lamented friend, Vice-Admiral Sir William Essington', who was in command of Triumph at the battle of Camperdown in October 1797. Sir J.G.Bremer took possession of the mainland on 20 September 1824 and founded the short-lived colony.A W Reed 'Place Names of Australia', Reed 1973. A local Aboriginal leader Medlone, also known as Jack Davis, acted as a messenger and manager for relations with the local Aboriginal people. In 1824 Port Essington was proposed as the first such settlement,Port Essington Travel Fact Sheet, The Sydney Morning Herald (2 December 2010) but was later passed over in favour of Fort Dundas on Melville Island and Fort Wellington at Raffles Bay. In 1831, a small station was constructed in the area, on Wurango clan land, in the hope of using it as a stopping point for ships, but it was rarely used. When both Fort Dundas and Fort Wellington failed within several years, the Port Essington site was revisited. As a result, a settlement, officially named Victoria Settlement after the young Queen Victoria, but popularly known as Port Essington, was established by Sir J. Gordon Bremer in 1838 and surveyed by Charles Tyers in 1839. It consisted of 24 houses and a hospital. A description of the harbour and settlement was communicated to the Royal Geographical Society, London, in 1839. On 24 August 1839 the only play ever staged in Port Essington was performed, the 1797 comedy in five acts Cheap Living by Frederick Reynolds.\\"Victoria's secrets reveal death and noble failure\\" by Mark Day, The Australian (30 October 2010). Accessed 9 April 2011 The set and costume design was by Owen Stanley (1811‚Äì1850).\\"Owen Stanley\\", Dictionary of Australian Artists Online, 25 February 2011. Accessed 9 April 2011 The play was performed again in 2010 with a grant from the Government of the Northern Territory,\\"Art Grants Awarded To Territorians\\" , Media release by Gerry McCarthy, Government of the Northern Territory (18 June 2010). Accessed 9 April 2011 with Tom Pauling, Administrator of the Northern Territory, acting as narrator in the play. While the British government intended to establish Port Essington as a major trading port, along the lines of Singapore, the new settlement suffered from the same adverse conditions that had previously plagued Fort Dundas and Fort Wellington. The settlement lacked resources and supplies and skilled labour. While some prefabricated buildings were brought from Sydney, many had to be built with what materials could be found in the area, and due to the unskilled nature of the builders, many of these were of poor quality. Disease was also rampant among the small population, and living conditions were poor. Consequently, it struggled to attract settlers, and the post was much-disliked by the troops stationed there. Setbacks Port Essington suffered a further setback when the settlement was demolished by a cyclone on 25 November 1839. The cyclone killed twelve people, drove the ship HMS Pelorus aground, and caused a 3.2 metre storm surge. The settlement was rebuilt afterwards, with some stone and brick buildings, due to the assistance of a brick maker who had been shipwrecked during the storm. Despite these setbacks, there was still widespread hope that Port Essington might be able to break the curse, as evidenced by Ludwig Leichhardt's 1844/1845 expedition. The New South Wales government had hoped to establish a direct line of communication with Asia, India and the Pacific, and supported Leichhardt's journey, which successfully charted an overland route between Moreton Bay (now Brisbane) and Port Essington. A detailed map of Ludwig Leichhardt's route in Australia from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (1844 & 1845), from his Original Map, adjusted and drawn... by John Arrowsmith was ranked #8 in the ‚ÄòTop 150: Documenting Queensland‚Äô exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives‚Äô events and exhibition program which contributed to the state‚Äôs Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales. In 1844, a group of convicts, which included trained masons and quarry men among them, was stationed at Port Essington. They were able to build a hospital of some quality at a beacon. This was followed by the 1846 decision of Father Angelo Confalonieri to found a Catholic mission nearby, in an attempt to convert the local population. He had some success, converting around 400 people, but he died of fever in 1848, and the mission died with him. Port Essington was still failing to attract settlers, and it was becoming increasingly clear both that the 1844 works had come too late, and that the settlement was unsustainable. Soon before its closure, British scientist Thomas Huxley wrote that Port Essington was \\"most wretched, the climate the most unhealthy, the human beings the most uncomfortable and houses in a condition most decayed and rotten\\". Abandonment Finally, in 1849, Port Essington was, like the two previous attempts, abandoned. The demise of the settlement saw the end of British attempts at occupying the north coast. There would be one further unsuccessful attempt, by the Government of South Australia and Frederick Henry Litchfield in 1864, at Escape Cliffs (also known as Palmerston) near the mouth of the Adelaide River, before the first permanent settlement was established at Darwin (also initially known as Palmerston), in 1869. The ruins of Port Essington still exist today, and while access is difficult, it is possible to do so by several means. It is possible to fly in through tours that can be arranged in Darwin, or to travel to the area alone by four-wheel drive or boat ‚Äì although, as the ruins lie on Aboriginal land, a permit must be obtained first. Cabins and some camping sites are available at Black Point Ranger Station. The Australian industrialist Essington Lewis was named after Port Essington.

Statement on Settlement  CP80  As of 2006, Yarro spends most of his time fighting Internet pornography with CP80. He is pushing for state legislationhttp://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid;=817589 to move all mature content to a different port than the standard HTTP port 80. On March 13, 2007, Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. held a ceremonial signinghttp://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/213120/ of House Concurrent Resolution 3, which urged the U.S. Congress to pass stricter anti-Internet pornography legislation. The CP80 foundation, a long time Internet pornography foe, was directly involved with the legislation. Its Internet pornography solution is part of the resolution. In April 2004, Yarro has been pushing for extending the legislationhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070818134938/http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660212991,00.html making ISPs responsible for content on open wireless access ports. The plan is to give tax incentives to ISPs who co-operate and volunteer as \\"community- protectors\\". It has not been made clear who exactly sets the standards and who stands to benefit from deployment of approved technical filtering and a rating system. According to the Deseret News Article, Utah ISP representatives, such as XMission owner Pete Ashdown, are opposed to restricting their operations while their out of state competitors aren't restricted. In the same article, Ashdown also questioned why local ISPs should be singled out when other local businesses, such as local hotels, can freely show porn on adult channels.  Yarro's Law  Starting in 2003, Yarro sponsored the development of a bill that would bring IP laws in the state of Utah current with those similar to California's. Attorneys and political experts were hired by Yarro to help develop the bill.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 11, 2001. In the episode, after Lisa becomes the target of a female bully named Francine, she discovers a scientific reason as to why bullies pick on nerds and demonstrates her findings at a science conference. Meanwhile, Homer goes into the childproofing business, causing baby-injury-related businesses to go in decline. John Frink and Don Payne wrote \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" and their original idea for the episode saw Lisa being sent to juvenile hall after accidentally punching Principal Skinner when she was attempting to punch Francine. \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" was the first The Simpsons episode directed by Lauren MacMullan, who also made the design for Francine. Actress and comedian Kathy Griffin guest starred in the episode as this new bully character. \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" has received generally positive reviews from critics and it was listed among \\"The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons\\" by the editorial staff of Nature. Around 8.8 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing, and in 2009 it was released on DVD along with the rest of the episodes of the twelfth season. Plot On an ordinary day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa attempts to make friends with a new girl, Francine, but Francine, who is much larger and tougher than Lisa, punches Lisa in the face, giving her a severe black eye. Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has turns out to be Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson and his friends Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love. It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her and the nerds. Meanwhile, Homer starts to fear that Maggie could die from touching things unsafe to her when he hears this from a childproofing saleswoman; and is alarmed when he learns of the cost of childproofing his house. As a result, he starts his own childproofing crusade, selling cheap but safe and effective products and making Springfield safe for children. However, this causes the baby-injury- related business in Springfield to go in decline. Homer feels bad for making people such as pediatricians lose their jobs and urges the children to get themselves hurt in order to save the pediatricians' careers. After realizing that Francine did not beat her up at the swimming pool because she was wearing a nose blocker, Lisa does scientific research on nerds and discovers that the odor of the chemical nerd pheromone \\"poindextrose\\" attracts bullies like Francine, proving that both nerds and bullies are predisposed to be what they are. Lisa then tests the poindextrose extracted from the nerds on famous boxer Drederick Tatum by putting it on his clothes when he visits the school. This causes Nelson to start punching Tatum uncontrollably and give him a wedgie. Lisa demonstrates her experiment at Professor Frink's science conference, the \\"12th Annual Big Science Thing\\", using an antidote on herself and making Francine peaceful and friendly towards her, the antidote being just salad dressing which covers up the smell of the poindextrose. The audience is impressed and Lisa is awarded a gift certificate from J. C. Penney for her research. However, the salad dressing soon runs out and Francine goes on an unprovoked rampage beating up all the scientists in the room. Francine‚Äôs parents suggest just letting Francine tire herself out from the beatings, just before Francine lunges herself at the viewer. Production Actress Kathy Griffin appeared in the episode as the bully Francine. The episode was produced as part of the twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000‚Äì01) and was written by writing partners John Frink and Don Payne. \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" was the first episode of the show directed by Lauren MacMullan, who joined the staff of The Simpsons following the cancellation of the short-lived television series Mission Hill, which was created by former Simpsons writers and executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein on which she worked as a supervising director and designer.MacMullan, Lauren (2009). The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season DVD commentary for the episode \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\". 20th Century Fox. American actress and stand-up comedian Kathy Griffin guest starred in the episode as the bully Francine. MacMullan designed this new character herself and tried to make her seem like a professional bully by having her carry her lunch box with her all the time like a briefcase. \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" was initially titled \\"Lisa the Bully\\" because the original idea for the episode, which the writers first pitched, saw Lisa becoming so fed up with Francine's behavior that she attempted to punch Francine.Payne, Don (2009). The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season DVD commentary for the episode \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\". 20th Century Fox. However, she would miss and accidentally punch Principal Skinner instead, resulting in her being sent to juvenile hall where she would make illegal jeans.Scully, Mike (2009). The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season DVD commentary for the episode \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\". 20th Century Fox. According to The Simpsons show runner Mike Scully, when the staff members worked on the episode they decided to include a lot of observations they had made about how it is like to be the new student in school. Scully has said that the episode shows how in real life the \\"poor new kid always has kind of two strikes against them just for being the new kid, and the other students are usually looking for anything that they perceive as different or weird about that kid.\\" The subplot of Homer entering the childproofing business was inspired by an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: \\"You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes you can make. They make you feel like the most horrible person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom.\\" \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song \\"Always Safety First\\" is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 11, 2001. During this broadcast, it was watched in approximately 8.8 million households. It received an 8.7 Nielsen rating, ranking twenty-sixth in the ratings for the week of March 5‚Äì11, 2001. The episode was seen by a fourteen percent share of the television audience during the broadcast. On August 18, 2009, \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season. Staff members Mike Scully, Don Payne, Lauren MacMullan, Tim Long, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Yeardley Smith, and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also featured on the box set. Critics have given \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" generally positive reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \\"While this isn‚Äôt saying much, 'Nerdie' provides one of Season 12‚Äôs better shows. Both plots work well, though I prefer the childproofing side of things; it peters out at the end, but it has some good bits. The episode keeps us interested and entertained.\\" Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict cited the scene in which the children imagine what kind of person the new student is as the greatest moment in the episode. In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed \\"Bye Bye Nerdie\\" among \\"The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons\\", writing: \\"Lisa isolates the element in nerd sweat that makes them irresistible targets for bullies. She presents her data at a conference with luminaries including former surgeon general C. Everett Koop, a scene in which we find the true purpose of a science pole.\\" At the conference, Professor Frink gets the attention of the audience by shouting \\"Pi is exactly three!\\", making everyone gasp. This scene and the episode as a whole has been used by mathematicians Sarah J.

It is home field for the New Orleans Gold team in Major League Rugby. Known as Zephyr Field when built in 1997 as the home ballpark for the New Orleans Zephyrs (later New Orleans Baby Cakes), the stadium was renamed when the Minor League Baseball team's nickname changed from Zephyrs to Baby Cakes in 2017. Shrine on Airline had been an unofficial name for Zephyr Field used by the public address announcer since the stadium opened and it became the new name. The facility hosted the 1998 and 2001 Conference USA Baseball Tournaments and the 1999 Sun Belt Conference Baseball Tournament. Shrine on Airline was also the site of the Class 5A Louisiana High School Athletic Association (LHSAA) baseball tournament in 2004 and 2005. History Zephyr Field hosted its first regular season baseball game on April 11, 1997, in which tenants New Orleans Zephyrs (later the New Orleans Baby Cakes), defeated the Oklahoma City 89ers 8-3. The stadium also hosted select games of the Tulane University Green Wave baseball program. The team plays annual games at the ballpark against cross-town rival, the University of New Orleans Privateers, and arch-rival, Louisiana State University Tigers, at the ballpark. During the 2006 and 2007 baseball seasons, Zephyr Field was the primary home of the Green Wave, as Tulane's on-campus facility, Greer Field at Turchin Stadium, was undergoing renovations. The renovations were scheduled to be completed in time for the 2006 season, but Hurricane Katrina significantly damaged Turchin Stadium, forcing a delay in the project. In the hurricane's aftermath, Zephyr Field was utilized by the Louisiana Army National Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a rescue facility. In 2006, the state of Louisiana approved $21 million to recover Zephyr Field from the effects of Katrina. Additional funds from the bill covered recovery costs for the New Orleans Saints' training facility, located behind the ballpark, and the New Orleans Arena. The stadium hosted the 1999 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the Pacific Coast League All-Stars defeated the International League All-Stars, 9‚Äì5. New Orleans' Daryle Ward was selected as the PCL MVP. On July 3, 2003, the largest crowd in Shrine on Airline history for a Zephyrs game, 11,925, watches the Zephyrs lose 1-0 to the Nashville Sounds. The Wally Pontiff Jr. Classic college baseball game has been held annually at the Shrine on Airline since 2004. The LSU Tigers baseball team plays an opponent in the game to honor the former Metairie resident, LSU Baseball player and Oakland A's draftee, Wally Pontiff Jr., who died at the age of 21 from a genetic heart disorder. In 2004, LSU won the first game of the series vs. Southeastern Louisiana, 9-3. The most recent Classic, which played in April of 2019, saw the Ragin Cajuns of Louisiana defeat LSU 6-5. The ballpark is featured in several scenes in the 2004 movie Mr. 3000, and one from the 2006 movie called Failure to Launch. Also, part of an episode of Spike TV's Pros vs Joes was also filmed at the ballpark. A new playing surface was installed prior to the 2008 season. Its new dimensions are from home plate to left and right fields, and to center. The ballpark traditionally has allowed some of the fewest home runs in the Pacific Coast League. The ballpark's grass berm seating area, \\"the Levee\\", is located beyond center field and is the highest point in Metairie. As a soccer venue, Shrine on Airline served as home of the New Orleans Storm soccer team in the late 1990s and hosted the semifinals of the 1998 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Ballpark attractions Concessions at Shrine on Airline feature traditional ballpark fare as well as several regional offerings, such as fried catfish, muffulettas, po' boy sandwiches, jambalaya, and pigskin nachos. The New Orleans Zephyrs added an extra $5 million to the 2006 state- funded recovery bill for additional amenities, including 16 luxury suites, a swimming pool, two hot tubs, the Coors Light Party Shack, and the Metairie Bank Home Run Porch.

It is the home of the Oklahoma City Dodgers, the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball team. The park has seating for up to 13,066 fans and currently utilizes a seating capacity of 9,000 for Dodgers games. The stadium frequently hosts the Phillips 66 Big 12 Baseball Tournament and is slated to host the tournament through 2020. The first Big 12 tournament was held at All Sports Stadium in 1997 before moving to Bricktown in 1998. The tournament has been held at Bricktown every year since, except for 2002 and 2004, when it was contested at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, the home park of the Texas Rangers, and in 2015 when Tulsa hosted the tournament. The ballpark also often hosts games of the Bedlam Series, in which the Oklahoma Sooners face the Oklahoma State Cowboys. The ballpark also hosts numerous other events both during and outside the baseball season. Those events include the Oklahoma High School Baseball Series in March, the snow tubing WinterFest November‚ÄìJanuary, a variety of community walks and runs, concerts, parties, corporate outings, meetings, seminars and more. Construction Oklahoma City voters approved a temporary one-cent sales tax increase in December 1993 to fund the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan (MAPS), the city's capital improvement program created to build and upgrade sports, recreation, entertainment, cultural and convention facilities. During the 66 months the sales tax was in effect, more than $309 million was collected. The $34 million Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark became the first major MAPS structure to be completed, helping spark a revitalization in Bricktown. Architectural Design Group of Oklahoma City served as the ballpark's architect and Oscar J. Boldt Construction Co., was the ballpark's general contractor. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on October 10, 1995, but actual construction did not begin until August 1996 due to escalating construction costs and the redesign of the ballpark by architects. The ballpark opened on April 16, 1998 with the RedHawks falling to the Edmonton Trappers 6-3 in front of a sellout crowd of 14,066 fans. Features Statues of legendary baseball players with Oklahoma ties stand before the ballpark's three main gates. A 7-foot-6 bronze statue of Mickey Mantle stands on a 3-foot granite base at the third base pavilion. Mantle, the New York Yankees' switch-hitting star, was born in Spavinaw and raised in Commerce. The Baseball Hall of Fame centerfielder's statue was dedicated on the ballpark's opening day April 16, 1998. Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench grew up in Binger, and a nine-foot statue of the former Cincinnati Reds star greets fans at the ballpark's home plate gate. The statue was dedicated July 27, 2001. A statue of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Warren Spahn was dedicated July 2, 2005. The Cy Young Award-winning left-hander hailed from Buffalo, New York, but chose to make Broken Arrow and Hartshorne his home after managing the Tulsa Drillers from 1967-71. His statue sits outside of the ballpark's right field gate. Approximately 480,000 bricks make up the exterior of the ballpark, which mixes retro charm with modern accommodations. A 10-foot-tall, 185-foot-long LED video board was added in left field for the 2011 season. The ballpark has received numerous accolades since its opening in 1998, including being named the No. 2 minor league ballpark in the country by Baseball America the year it opened and being hailed as one of the country's top 10 minor league stadiums in the 2013 10Best Readers' Choice Awards, presented by USA Today. Name changes The stadium was to be called \\"Southwestern Bell Park\\". When the general public learned that Bricktown wasn't part of the name, there was an uproar. Due to public pressure, the stadium opened as Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark (later SBC Bricktown Ballpark after Southwestern Bell's name change). In March 2006, the ballpark was renamed AT&T; Bricktown Ballpark following the merger between SBC and Old AT&T.; After AT&T; reevaluated its sports marketing strategy, they gave up naming rights, resulting in the RedHawks Field at Bricktown designation for 2011. On April 4, 2012, it was announced that Newcastle Gaming Center in the nearby suburb of Newcastle (owned by the Chickasaw Nation) had purchased naming rights to the ballpark, with the new Newcastle Field at Bricktown name effective immediately. The name change led to public outcry, principally over the prospect of a suburb's name appearing on a city-owned building. One day later on April 5, 2012 (the opening day of the 2012 RedHawks season), Newcastle Gaming Center announced that it would once again rename the ballpark as the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. Notable games *The ballpark opened April 16, 1998 with the RedHawks losing to visiting Edmonton, 6-3, in front of 14,066 fans‚Äîthe third-largest crowd for an Oklahoma City home opener behind 14,801 in 1992 and 14,488 in 1987.

History of ballparks in Oklahoma City Amateur teams started playing on makeshift fields shortly after the state's Land Run in 1889 in a centrally located site near where Bricktown sits today. In fact, Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark sits within a block of the original site. The city's first ballpark structure was Colcord Field, located along the banks of the North Canadian River in 1904, which was home to Oklahoma City's first professional baseball team. The facility was also called Saratoga Park, Liberty Park and Western League Park before being destroyed by flooding in 1923. Holland Field, located at NW 4 and Pennsylvania, was built in 1924 and later became Tribe Park in the early 1940s and Texas League Park in 1946. All Sports Stadium opened in 1962 and was located at NW 10th Street and May at the state fairgrounds. The 89ers played there for 36 seasons. Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark celebrated its 20th season in 2017 at which numerous festivities were held throughout the season to mark this milestone, including a kickoff luncheon prior to the season featuring former OKC mayors and PCL President Branch B. Rickey. A commemorative brick display benefitting the OKC Dodgers Baseball Foundation was unveiled on the Mickey Mantle Plaza and fans were able to vote online throughout the season to select an All- Ballpark Team and determine the best players to step on the field at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. Ceremonial first pitches took place throughout the season, players wore special 20th Season jerseys, new merchandise was introduced in the Team Store and a 20th Season Stein was given away to fans to help mark the special occasion.

They are very inexpensive, constructed using polymers and alloyed metals as much as possible, resulting in a reduction of production costs and sale price. It functions via a simple direct blowback action. Origin Developed during the now-defunct 1994 Federal assault weapons ban, the Hi-Point carbine comes with a ten-round magazine that fits into the pistol grip. With the expiration of the federal assault weapons ban in 2004, aftermarket third-party fifteen- and fourteen-round magazines are now also available in most states. A company called \\"Redball Sports\\" as of 2016 manufactures a twenty-shot magazine for the Model 995 carbine. The proprietary magazines are usable only with Hi-Point firearms. The pistol-style magazines for the 4095 .40 S&W; carbine are fully interchangeable with the Hi- Point .40 S&W; pistol. No such compatibility was advertised by Hi-Point regarding the original 995 carbine and the 9mm Hi-Point C-9 pistol; owners of both designs have reported that they are not completely interchangeable. The 8 shot pistol magazine is too short to fit the carbine; however, the 10 shot carbine magazine will fit into the pistol but extends past the bottom of the grip. Development The Hi-Point carbine was developed for the civilian market and not specifically aimed at police department use. Nevertheless, it has been approved and purchased by a small number of local police departments that cannot easily afford to outfit all of their officers with more expensive long guns. In the first quarter of 2009, a new model of the 995 carbine was released, the 995TS, which features a new stock and last round hold open. The TS model is slightly more expensive than the \\"995 Classic,\\" affectionately known as \\"the Planet of the Apes gun.\\" The 4095 model in .40 S&W; and the newest model, the Model 4595 in .45 ACP, are available only in the new TS configuration. As of September 2010, the \\"995 Classic\\" or \\"4095 Classic\\" are no longer featured on the Hi-Point website. As of November 2017, Hi-Point has put into production a new carbine in 10mm Auto. Based on the Model 4595TS, the Model 1095TS functions similarly to the 4595TS, with a 10 round single-stack magazine and a telescoping bolt in a blowback action.Fortier, David. \\"Economical 10mm Carbine,\\" Firearms News, Volume 71, Issue 22, November 2017. Options for the Hi-Point carbine are few. The company does make a muzzle brake for them that substantially reduces muzzle flip when shooting, and there are lasers and flashlights that mount easily to the new TS pattern stocks. An independent firm markets a bolt handle that screws on to the existing bolt handle and makes manipulating the bolt more comfortable for the shooter.http://www.dmcharginghandles.com/ . Retrieved November 19, 2014. High Tower Armory also offers a \\"Bullpup\\" style stock for Hipoint Carbines. It is also possible to mount a scope if the shooter wishes to do so. Legality The Hi Point Carbine has since been designated an assault weapon in the State of Connecticut with the April 4, 2013 signing of Public Act 13-3.http://www.ct.gov/despp/lib/despp/slfu/pa_13-3.pdf It has been similarly designated by the State of New York with the signing of the NY SAFE Act and as of mid-2013, purchase of any of the unaltered carbines has been restricted to law enforcement officers. However, in 2014 a company developed a shield that prevents the shooter from wrapping his or her hand around the pistol grip, which means that legally the pistol grip is not a pistol grip within the definition of such under the SAFE Act. With the shield fitted, Hi-Point carbines are again legal to own in New York state. Popularity Hi-Point 995 with stock from Advanced Technology, Inc. (ATI)and 15-round magazine. The carbine was listed as the 7th most popular pistol caliber carbine in 2019. Some 28,000 were made and sold in 1998 alone, and it continues to sell well. After the success of the 9mm Model 995, the Model 4095 was created in the .40 S&W; caliber. It shares much of the success of the Model 995. The Model 4595TS is a success and shares the popularity of the smaller-caliber versions. Hi- Point carbines consistently score high in evaluations run by Gun Tests Magazine.

As of 2018, UW-Stevens Point has merged with UW-Stevens Point at Wausau and UW-Stevens Point at Marshfield. History After securing land and funding from the City of Stevens Point and Portage County and winning the right to host the new normal school, Stevens Point Normal School opened on September 17, 1894 with 201 students.\\"University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Stevens Point\\", Malcolm Rosholt Online Archives, Portage County Historical Society, retrieved June 11, 2014. In addition to teacher preparation, \\"domestic science\\" (home economics) and conservation education were offered; the latter formed the basis for the College of Natural Resources. In 1927, Stevens Point Normal School became Central State Teachers College and began offering four-year teaching degrees. When post-World War II enrollment became less centered on teacher training and more focused on liberal arts education, the Wisconsin State Legislature intervened, changing the school's name to Wisconsin State College‚ÄìStevens Point with the authority to grant bachelor's degrees in liberal arts. In 1940, William C. Hansen began his 22-year tenure as the institution's longest- serving president.\\"Former UW-Point president Hansen dies\\", Marshfield News- Herald (August 3, 1983), p. 15. Ever larger numbers of students in the 1950s and 1960s led to construction on campus throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It was during this period, in 1964, that the college was elevated to university status as Wisconsin State University‚ÄìStevens Point and began offering graduate degrees. Seven years later, the Wisconsin State Universities merged into the University of Wisconsin system, and the school adopted its current name. UW-Stevens Point has more than 77,000 alumni. More than half of these alumni live in Wisconsin. In 1968, UW-Stevens Point formed the Northwoods battalion, an ROTC unit for the United States army. Lee S. Dreyfus became chancellor in 1974 before becoming Wisconsin's 40th governor. Governor Dreyfus was inaugurated on the lawn in front of Old Main on the UW-Stevens Point campus in 1979.

Biography Belain, commanding a 14-gun brigantine with a crew of 40 in 1625, arrived on the island of St. Christopher. In 1626 he returned to France, where he won the support of Cardinal Richelieu to establish French colonies in the region. Richelieu became a shareholder in the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe, created to accomplish this with D'Esnambuc at its head. The company was not particularly successful and Richelieu had it reorganized as the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique. In 1635 D'Esnambuc sailed to Martinique with one hundred French settlers to clear land for sugarcane plantations. This led to tensions with the indigenous Carib population. He established Jean Dupont as local governor before returning to Saint Christophe. Open warfare led to the French expelling surviving Carib from St Christophe in 1644. Having spent six months on Martinique, D'Esnambuc returned to Saint Christopher, where he soon died. His nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, inherited D'Esnambuc's authority over the French settlements in the Caribbean. He remained in Martinique and did not concern himself with the other islands.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 4, 2001. In the episode, Homer becomes a Good Samaritan after discovering the simple joys of helping people in need ‚Äì which is put to the test when he goes on a hunger strike after the owner of the Springfield Isotopes baseball team attempts to discredit him when Homer stumbles on his plot to discreetly move the team to Albuquerque, New Mexico. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Nancy Kruse, and guest starred Stacy Keach as Howard K. Duff VIII. Since airing, it has received generally mixed reviews from television critics. The episode inspired the naming of the Albuquerque Isotopes minor-league baseball team, which began play in 2003. Plot The Simpson family visits Blockoland, a theme park similar to Legoland which is completely made of blocks. When Lisa finds a piece missing from an Eiffel Tower kit she has bought, Homer persuades the gift shop clerk to give it to her. Energized by the idea of \\"standing up for the little guy,\\" Homer talks a girl Bart likes into going to a school dance with him, gets a beauty salon owner to put free highlights in Marge's hair, and finds a way for the salon to cut its expenses. He next tries to get Lenny a refund on his season tickets for the Springfield Isotopes baseball team (previously introduced in the season 2 episode \\"Dancin' Homer\\"). At the Isotopes' ballpark, Homer encounters team owner Howard K. Duff VIII, who refuses to grant a refund. In his haste to leave, Homer discovers a room filled with merchandise for the \\"Albuquerque Isotopes\\" and realizes that Howard is planning to move the team. Howard denies the idea, then has Duffman drug Homer and dump him at the Simpsons' house to cover up the truth. Homer attempts to warn the media of Howard's plan, but by the time he can lead reporters to the ballpark, Howard has removed all evidence of it. Angered by their dismissal of his claim and calling him a liar, Homer stages a hunger strike, chaining himself to a pole in the parking lot and refusing to leave or eat until Howard admits the truth. After Homer begins to attract public attention, the team secretly moves him into the ballpark one night and dubs him \\"Hungry, Hungry Homer\\" as a publicity stunt. They claim publicly that Homer will not eat until the Isotopes win the pennant, covering up his real message. As his health declines and he begins rapidly losing weight, he nearly gives in while seeing fans eat at the ballpark. However, a visit by the ghost of Cesar Chavez (who assumes the appearance of Cesar Romero, since Homer does not know what Chavez looks like) inspires him to stand his ground. Thinking that Homer has gone insane and that his popularity is waning, Howard unchains him and offers him a hot dog in a public ceremony during an Isotopes game. As Homer is about to eat it, he realizes that it is loaded with Southwestern-style toppings and angrily denounces Howard. Inspecting their own hot dogs, the fans discover their wrappers marked with the \\"Albuquerque Isotopes\\" team name and realize that Homer was right from the start. The crowd boos Howard, and Duffman turns against him and throws him bodily off the field. Homer earns a round of cheers from the crowd and ends his hunger strike, eagerly devouring the food they throw to him. The mayor of Albuquerque abandons his plan to steal the Isotopes from Springfield and decides to turn his attention to purchasing the Dallas Cowboys, with the intent of forcing them to play baseball instead of football, declaring, \\"For I am the Mayor of Albuquerque!\\" Production The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Nancy Kruse. The episode was originally pitched by Al Jean from his daughter, although it is not certain. The origin of the episode is that Mike Scully in season 8 pitched an episode where Homer gets a motorcycle, however the town passes a helmet law that requires riders to wear a helmet, leading Homer to go on a hunger strike in protest.Simpsons Season 12 DVD, Commentary \\"Hungry, Hungry Homer\\". The writers shelved the idea of Homer having a motorcycle (though it would be used for the season 11 episode \\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\\"), but held on to Homer having a hunger strike until Al Jean pitched this episode. Another inspiration was that a team was moving to another city. Dan Castellaneta adlibbed the lyrics to Homer's \\"Dancing Away My Hunger Pains\\" song. The ending scene with the mayor announcing his plans to take over the Dallas Cowboys has been edited from all U.S. syndicated reruns, but has been seen on overseas syndicated reruns and on the season 12 DVD set. Cultural references The title of the episode is a reference to the Hasbro tabletop game Hungry Hungry Hippos. Duffman turning against Howard K. Duff and throwing him over a fence is a reference to Darth Vader turning on Emperor Palpatine in the film Return of the Jedi (1983). After being drugged, Homer wakes up lying on top of a dog house, similar to the way Snoopy lays on his dog house in the Peanuts comic strip. (Bart even says \\"Good Grief!\\" in another reference to the strip.) Later, when Homer returns to the Duff Stadium and finds the private room empty, a man plays \\"wah-wah\\" on a muted trumpet, again a reference to Peanuts. When tied to the flagpole, Lisa gives Homer a book to read called \\"My Core Beliefs\\" by Mike Farrell. Homer flips through it and says \\"Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers.\\" This is in reference to the named actors' characters on the TV show M*A*S*H, in which Farrell's character BJ Hunnicutt replaced Rogers' character Trapper John McIntyre. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Hungry, Hungry Homer\\" was viewed by an estimated 10.0156 million households and received a 9.8 rating/15 share Nielsen Rating making it into the top twenty. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie guide gave the episode a mixed review writing \\"Though it has something of a rehashed feel ‚Äì an impression that we‚Äôve seen this episode before ‚Äì ‚ÄòHungry‚Äô still manages to be fairly effective. Chock full of laughs? No, but the show has its moments. Or maybe I just like it because it‚Äôs the origin of the word ‚Äòhungy‚Äô, which I used for many years. I forgot I stole it from this episode!\\" Judge Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict said of the episode that the best moment was pretty much any scene with Duffman. =Legacy= This episode inspired the name of the real-life Albuquerque Isotopes minor-league baseball team, which came to Albuquerque in 2003 after being known as the Calgary Cannons.https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/55464/how-albuquerque-isotopes- got-their-name A few days after the episode aired, Albuquerque Journal journalist Leanne Potts acknowledged how then Mayor Jim Baca was making similar efforts to move the Canadian baseball team to Albuquerque with a $28 million stadium offer, even stating \\"it seemed the \\"Simpsons\\" writers were commenting on politics in Albuquerque\\" and that the episode \\"wasn't a case of cartoons imitating life, but of life imitating cartoons.\\"https://www.abqjournal.com/quirky/isotopes03-06-01.htm In tribute to the episode, statues of Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa were placed in the Albuquerque Isotopes stadium. This episode has also been credited for popularizing the word \\"meh\\", which later entered the Collins English Dictionary. The word is an interjection expressing boredom or indifference, and an adjective describing something boring or mediocre. The word, which has its root in Yiddish, is expressly spelled out in the episode: :Homer: Kids, how would you like to go to ... Blockoland! :Bart and Lisa: Meh. :Homer: But the TV gave me the impression that -- :Bart: We said, \\"Meh!\\" :Lisa: M-e-h, meh. The word had been used on several previous occasions on the show, the first such usage being in the season six episode \\"Sideshow Bob Roberts\\" in 1994. In that episode, Lisa is given the town's voting record for the mayoral election; in response to her question that she \\"thought this was a secret ballot,\\" the official responds \\"meh\\". John Swartzwelder, the writer of \\"Hungry, Hungry Homer\\" has stated that he \\"originally heard the word from an advertising writer named Howie Krakow back in 1970 or 1971 who insisted it was the funniest word in the world.\\" Homer's line \\"...I gave the guy directions, even though I didn‚Äôt know the way. Because that‚Äôs the kind of guy I am this week.‚Äù is paraphrased by Patrick Stump in his band Fall Out Boy's 2005 single \\"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\\".https://www.kerrang.com/features/taking-a-deeper- look-at-fall-out-boys-sugar-were-goin-down-video/ References External links *\\"Hungry, Hungry Homer\\" at The Simpsons.com 'Meh': new word for indifference enters English dictionary () The Simpsons (season 12) episodes 2001 American television episodes Television shows written by John Swartzwelder Baseball animation ","title":"Hungry, Hungry Homer"},{"id":"1777860","text":"Souli () is a municipality in Epirus, northwestern Greece.

In the earliest historical text about Souli, written by Christoforos Perraivos in 1803, an oral tradition of the locals is recorded. According to this, the first settlers of Souli were shepherds who came from a village called Gardiki trying to avoid the Ottoman oppression. A certain Muslim (\\"Turk\\" in the text) named Soulis attempted to expel the early Souliotes from there but the latter resisted with arms.

It was also the regular season home of the Pecos League's Tucson Saguaros baseball team from 2016 to 2017. It seats 11,500 fans, and hosts concerts in addition to its primary function as a baseball park. Kino Sports Complex is also used to host soccer matches. FC Tucson of USL League One plays its home matches at the complex's North Stadium, its primary soccer stadium. The complex serves as the preseason home of Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls and host of the Desert Diamond Cup preseason soccer tournament. History =Spring training and AAA venue= Tucson Electric Park opened in 1998. Larger and more modern than central Tucson's Hi Corbett Field, it is situated 4 miles south of Hi Corbett, at the intersection of several major thoroughfares including I-10 and SR-86. TEP opened the same year that the Arizona Diamondbacks began operations in Phoenix, and the Tucson Toros moved from Hi Corbett to TEP, renamed themselves the Tucson Sidewinders, and became the Diamondbacks' AAA affiliate. Furthermore, the Diamondbacks themselves became a tenant of TEP for spring training, sharing the facility with the Chicago White Sox (who moved from their previous spring training facility in Sarasota, Florida). Across town, the Colorado Rockies continued to hold their spring training at Hi Corbett Field. =Departure of MLB spring training= The Chicago White Sox had an agreement to move to Glendale in a stadium that was completed in the 2009 season. However, the Sox' lease on TEP was to last through 2012. In order to leave TEP early, the Sox proposed a youth baseball academy backed by Major League Baseball surrounding TEP. On November 18, 2008 the Pima County Board of Supervisors agreed to the White Sox's revised offer of $5 million, thus allowing the team to move to Glendale in time for the 2009 season. Colorado Rockies, spring training occupant of Tucson's Hi Corbett Field, and the Arizona Diamondbacks, who were tenants at TEP and the Kino Sports Complex, indicated that they would both need Tucson to have three teams in order to continue playing there.http://www.pima.gov/current/White.Sox.economic.development.proposal.pdf Tucson was therefore abandoned as a spring training venue, and all Cactus League games now take place in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The Diamondbacks and Rockies share the new Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, which opened in 2011 near Scottsdale. =Departure of the Sidewinders= The Tucson Sidewinders also played their last season at TEP in 2008. The team moved to Reno, Nevada, renaming itself the Reno Aces and remaining the AAA affiliate of the Diamondbacks. At the same time, the Reno Silver Sox of the independent Golden Baseball League, displaced by the arrival of the Aces, relocated to Tucson. Instead of using TEP, however, the new team located itself at the more historic Hi Corbett Field and retook the historic name of the Tucson Toros. TEP was thus, for a time, without any Major League or minor league baseball tenant. =Name change= In 2010, after the end of the naming agreement with the local electric utility, Tucson Electric Power, the stadium was renamed after Eusebio Kino, the Jesuit missionary who first explored southern Arizona in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The Pima County Board of Supervisors approved the name change (Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium) on January 18, 2011. =Tucson Padres= In 2011, the San Diego Padres Triple-A affiliate relocated from Portland, Oregon to Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium and renamed itself the Tucson Padres. They were formerly known as the Portland Beavers. Originally the San Diego Padres organization wanted to arrange for a stadium to be approved and constructed in Escondido, California, however that stadium plan later fell through when California eliminated their redevelopment agencies. The team departed Tucson for El Paso, Texas prior to the beginning of the 2014 season and assumed the name \\"El Paso Chihuahuas.\\" =FC Tucson= Since 2012, FC Tucson has played its games at Kino Sports Complex's North Stadium. The club began its existence in the Premier Development League, and in 2019 began play in the higher-level USL League One. =Pima Community College= The Pima Community College Aztecs football played its home games at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium for several seasons. The team will move to the Kino Sports Complex North Stadium for its 2014 fall Football season.

Description Situated to the west of the Sandgate station, the overpass was built in 2006 by the Australian Rail Track Corporation to allow coal trains to access the Port of Kooragang without conflicting with services on the Main North line. The previous at-grade junction required that approximately 120 coal trains per day had to cross from the coal lines over the main lines to reach the branch line to the port. The main lines also carried about 120 trains per day. At the time of its construction, it was estimated that the project, once completed, would increase bulk coal handling capacity of between per annum. At the time of the construction of the flyover, the main lines were raised over the junction of the coal lines to the Kooragang branch, so that the conflict between trains was eliminated.

Van Voorhis was laid down on 29 August 1955 at the New York Shipbuilding Company in Camden, New Jersey; launched on 28 July 1956, sponsored by Mrs. Kathryn Van Voorhis, the widow of Cmdr. Van Voorhis; and commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 April 1957, with Lt. Cmdr. Joseph J. Doak, Jr., in command. Service history =1950s= Following shakedown training near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during the summer, Van Voorhis reported at Newport, Rhode Island, for duty with Escort Squadron 14 (CortRon 14). The destroyer escort conducted operations along the east coast of North America until May 1958 when she sailed across the Atlantic for a cruise with the 6th Fleet. While operating with other ships of the 6th Fleet near Crete, she was ordered to the eastern end of the Mediterranean in mid-July to patrol off the Levantine coast. She supported the Marines who landed in Lebanon in response to President Camille Chamoun's request for help during a crisis precipitated by Arab nationalist factions in reaction to his administration's pro-Western policies and its adherence to the Eisenhower Doctrine. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's personal representative Robert D. Murphy helped the factions to negotiate a settlement which resulted in the election of General Fuad Chehab to the presidency on 31 July. President Chamoun's refusal to yield office before the expiration of his term kept the country in turmoil until late September. However, political conditions in Lebanon remained highly volatile, so American forces remained there until after General Chehab took office in September. During this period, Van Voorhis alternated normal 6th Fleet operations with patrols off Lebanon. Late in September, the warship departed the Mediterranean and returned to Newport early in October. =1960s= Upon her return, the warship operated along the east coast until February 1959 when she joined the other ships of her squadron in a three-month cruise to South America. She re-entered Newport late in April and resumed local operations once more. She continued that employment through June 1960. The following month, she departed the United States for duty in the eastern Atlantic. During that six-week cruise, Van Voorhis joined other Navy ships and units of Allied navies in a NATO exercise. She also visited Greenwich, England, and Greenock, Scotland, before returning to Newport where, after upkeep, she resumed anti-submarine warfare operations. She remained so occupied through the remainder of 1960. Over the following two years, the destroyer escort continued the routine of summer operations out of Newport and winter training in the West Indies. In the autumn of 1962, when the United States subjected Cuba to a quarantine in order to keep offensive missiles from the strategically situated island, Van Voorhis moved to Mayport, Florida, to support the blockade-type operation. After spending the last week of the quarantine in Mayport, she returned north without having actually participated in the operation. In December, the warship began preparations for another overseas deployment. On 15 February 1963, she cleared port for a three-month goodwill cruise to Africa‚Äî\\"Solant Amity IV.\\" During the first half of the cruise, she moved south, along the western coast of Africa, and called at Monrovia, Liberia; Lagos, Nigeria; Pointe Noiro, Congo; and Cape Town, South Africa. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, she moved north, up the eastern coast of Africa, and visited Lourenco Marques, Mozambique; Diego Suarez, Malagasy Republic; and Mombasa, Kenya. She continued north to Aden, transited the Red Sea and the Suez Canal and entered the Mediterranean on 1 May. During the first two weeks of May, Van Voorhis crossed the Mediterranean making liberty calls at Athens, Naples, and Barcelona along the way. She rounded out the voyage with one-day stops at Gibraltar and the Azores, and re-entered Newport on 24 May. Following upkeep, she conducted ASW exercises in July and made a midshipman cruise to Bermuda. Additional ASW training off the Florida coast ensued before the ship returned to Newport in October. For the remainder of 1963 and throughout 1964, the destroyer escort operated along the eastern seaboard. On 8 August 1964, she was reassigned to Escort Squadron 8 (CortRon 8) as the squadron flagship. She continued ASW training exercises through 1964 and during the first part of January 1965. During the latter part of the month, the ship entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a six-week availability during which she received control equipment associated with the Drone Antisubmarine Helicopter (DASH) system. The installation was completed early in March, and Van Voorhis departed Boston on the 9th to participate in the annual \\"Springboard\\" exercises conducted in the Caribbean. Upon completion of that assignment, Van Voorhis returned north to receive her DASH helicopters. She arrived in Norfolk on 29 March and began three weeks of tests and qualifications with the DASH system. The first destroyer escort to receive DASH, Van Voorhis completed her qualification trials in April and returned to her home port on 21 April. The ship continued to work out of Newport through the following four and one-half years, primarily conducting operations in the western Atlantic. She sharpened her anti-submarine warfare skills constantly as she participated in numerous exercises along the entire North American coastline and in the Caribbean. In August 1966, Van Voorhis rendezvoused with the destroyer escort , guided missile frigate , and submarine off Trinidad to participate in Operation \\"Unitas VII\\" through November. In 1966 and 1967, the warship made cruises around South America in which she visited a number of South American ports and participated in bilateral and multi-lateral exercises with warships of various South American countries. During the first five months of 1969, her sphere of operations was centered around Florida and the West Indies. In June, she returned to Newport for a short time before resuming operations in the Caribbean in July. Through the fall and winter of 1969, she alternated between Newport and the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida. =1970‚Äì1971 and fate= In January 1970, Van Voorhis began preparations for conversion to a research and development platform to test the Interim Towed Array Surveillance System (ITASS). Late that month, her DASH equipment was removed to make room for the ITASS submarine detection gear. On 9 February, she entered the Bethlehem Steel Shipyards in East Boston to begin the actual conversion. Over the next month, her new equipment was installed, and her DASH hangar was modified to provide a berthing area for the additional crew members necessitated by the ITASS. Van Voorhis completed the conversion early in March and, for the next four months, she conducted a series of tests on the experimental equipment in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay, then in the Tongue of the ocean off Eleuthera in the Bahamas. From late June to late August, she prepared to deploy to the Mediterranean. She departed Newport on 26 August 1970, passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 6 September, and arrived at Naples on 9 September. The destroyer escort operated with the 6th Fleet, conducting surveillance patrols with her new ITASS gear until near the end of November. During the intervening two months, she also called at such places as Barcelona, Mallorca, Crete, and Naples. On 17 November, she turned the 6th Fleet ITASS responsibility over to her relief, the destroyer escort . After a liberty call at Palma de Mallorca and change of operational control at Rota, Spain, Van Voorhis set out to recross the Atlantic on 26 November and arrived in Newport on 6 December. Van Voorhis began 1971 in port at Newport and operated from that base during the first eight months of the year. In September, the warship underwent an inspection and survey which found her to be unfit for further naval service. She remained moored at Newport until the following summer. Van Voorhis was decommissioned on 1 July 1972, and her name was struck from the Navy list simultaneously. On 15 June 1973, she was sold to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, of New York City, and was subsequently scrapped.

In 1988, it seemed likely that the Capitol would be demolished and turned into a parking lot. Popular outcry, however, led to the city of Logan purchasing the theatre and a not-for-profit organization was formed to renovate and operate it, now known as the Cache Valley Center for the Arts.

Following Galbraith's death in 1837, his land holdings were subsequently auctioned. In 1840, James Larmer surveyed a village site and a route over the mountains from Nerriga to Vincentia. It was intended that this pass, known as the Wool Road would allow movement of agricultural produce to a port on Jervis Bay from the Braidwood and Goulburn districts. The road was completed in 1841, a distance of approximately at an estimated cost of ¬£997. In 1842, the existing road linking Nerriga to Braidwood was substantially upgraded. Both projects utilised convict labour under the command of Nerriga landowner Colonel John Mackenzie.http://www.stgeorgesbasin.info/level2/heritage.html The discovery of alluvial gold on the Shoalhaven River in 1851 led to increased interest in the area around Nerriga, and the town began to grow, with the Commercial Hotel opening for business some time around 1864.http://nerriga.com.au/ The building still stands today, but is now known as the Bark Tree Hotel.

In early medieval times it was known as Doros () or Dory () by the Byzantines, later it was given the Kipchak name Mangup.  History  According to the 6th-century Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea, the region of Dory or Doros was settled by those Ostrogoths who refused to follow Theodoric the Great in his invasion of Italy in the 490s, marking the beginning of the Crimean Goths and their homeland, Gothia. Archaeological excavations have demonstrated the establishment of Christian basilicas, fortifications and cave settlements (alongside Mangup also at Eski Kermen etc.) during the 6th century. By the late 7th or early 8th century, a new bishopric, the Metropolis of Doros, was established in the region. Crimean Gothia was conquered by the Khazars in the early 8th century, and later in the 8th century was the center of an unsuccessful Gothic revolt against Khazaria led by Bishop John of Gothia. As a result of the Khazar conquest, the name Dory/Doros disappeared after the 9th century and was replaced by Mangup, first attested ca. 960, although the early medieval name may have survived in a corrupted form in the name of the Principality of Theodoro, which existed in the area in the late Middle Ages. In the mid-10th century, the Crimean Goths were Khazar vassals, before falling under the influence of competing powers: the Kievan Rus and the Kipchak tribal confederacy. The town was severely damaged by an earthquake in the 11th century, yet managed to maintain autonomy during the Mongol conquest of Crimea but was compelled to pay tribute to the Great Khan. In ca. 1223, the towns of Gothia may have been tributary to the Empire of Trebizond, and in the late 13th/early 14th century Mangup became the centre of the Principality of Theodoro, whose ruling elite maintained Byzantine traditions and the use of the Greek language. The ruling dynasty, stemming from the area of Trebizond, was called Gabras (in Greek) or Chowra (in Turkish). In the late 14th century, one branch of the dynasty emigrated to Moscow, where they established the Simonov Monastery. The Khovrins, as they came to be known, were hereditary treasurers of Muscovy. In the 16th century, they changed their name to Golovin. Between 1395 and 1404, Theodoro was under the control of Timur, but its prince, Alexios, managed to regain his independence after Timur's death, and his successors maintained it until the Ottoman conquest in 1475, thus ending the last remnant of the Roman Empire after 2238 years of civilization. In 1475, Stephen III of Moldavia sent his brother-in-law, Alexander Gabras, to Mangup with the purpose of replacing a local ruler from the Gabras family, who was Alexander's own brother and vassal to the Ottomans. In May that same year, the Ottoman commander Gedik Ahmet Pasha conquered Caffa and at the end of the year, after five months of besieging Mangup, the city fell to the assault. While much of the rest of Crimea remained part of the Crimean Khanate, now an Ottoman vassal, former lands of Theodoro and southern Crimea was administered directly by the Sublime Porte. The Turkish historian Djennebi mention that in 1475, after the taking of Caffa, Gedik Ahmet Pasha decided to take possession of the fortress of Mankup. The Greeks established themselves therein and defended it but the Turks captured the fortress. The siege of Mangup lasted for half a year and the Turks used cannons.MAIN STAGES OF THE HISTORY DOROS- THEODORO (MANGUP)IN THE LIGHT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH EXPEDITION - TAURIDA VERNADSKY NATIONAL UNIVERSITY - Gertsen A. G., p. 201 The town's inexorable decline continued. In 1774 the fortress was abandoned by the Turkish garrison. The last inhabitants, a small community of Karaims, abandoned the site in the 1790s. In 1901, a Greek inscription was discovered in the city. The inscription shows that in 1503, almost thirty years after the Turkish conquest, the inhabitants of Mankup still spoke Greek and were taking care to restore the walls of their city. From the inscription, historians learned that the population of Mankup was under the power of a Turkish governor. In 1913, a Greek inscription was found in a basilica which mention the Emperor Justinian. The inscription proves that under Justinian the city was already important enough to be considered by the Emperor.

Institute 22 was a secret organization for 13 years (until the fall of the Soviet Union), and can be compared to the American Project Blue Book. During its existence a great number of soldiers, sailors and pilots of the Soviet Army were given orders to watch for UFOs and other unexplained events, without any further information. The orders could be handed out quite easily since the Ministry of Defense was involved - thus no questions could be asked. Institute 22 have investigated around 3000 UFO reports.

Raymur, started the New London Mechanics Institute, a meeting room and library for mill employees. In March 1869, it was renamed the Hastings Literary Institute, in honour of Rear Admiral the Honourable George Fowler Hastings. No official records of the Hastings Literary Institute have survived, but it is known that membership was by subscription. The Hastings Literary Institute continued to exist until the Granville area was incorporated as part of the new City of Vancouver on April 6, 1886. Following the Great Vancouver Fire on June 13, 1886, 400 books from the now-defunct Hastings Literary Institute were donated to the newly established Vancouver Reading Room. In December 1887, the Reading Room opened at 144 West Cordova Street, above the Thomas Dunn and Company hardware store. It was also known as the Vancouver Free Library and the Vancouver Free Reading Room and Library. By the late 1890s, the Free Reading Room and Library in the YMCA Building on West Hastings had become overcrowded. During this period, the American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was giving money to cities and towns to build libraries. In 1901, the City of Vancouver approached Carnegie about donating money for a new library to replace the space in the YMCA Building. Vancouver Carnegie Library was completed in 1903. The building was used as a public library until 1957. In 1901, American steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie agreed to donate $50,000 to build a city library if Vancouver would provide free land and $5,000 annually to support its operation. A fight immediately developed between East and West side Vancouver as to who would get the new cultural institution. A public plebiscite fixed the site at Hastings and Westminster (now Main) Streets, next door to the first City Hall. The cornerstone was laid by the Grand Lodge of the Masonic Order on March 29, 1902 and under it were placed Masonic documents, a copy of the City‚Äôs Act of Incorporation, lists of various officials and examples of the postage stamps and coins then in use. The building was designed by Vancouver architect George Grant and is in the style of Romanesque Renaissance, with a domed Ionic portico and French mansard roof. Granite for the foundation came from Indian Arm and sandstone for the 10\\" thick walls came from Gabriola Island. A fantastic marble, spiral staircase was built by Albion Iron Works of Victoria. It cost $2.279 million and 9,888 pounds of steel and iron were used. A large multi-panel stained glass window with 3 smaller windows below was designed and crafted by N.T. Lyon of Toronto. Depicted in the windows are John Milton, William Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Thomas More, Canada's Historic Places - Carnegie Centre, 401 Main Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6A, Canada and Edmund Spenser. UBC Community, Partners, and Alumni Publications - The history of Carnegie Centre The 3 small windows were removed in 1958 when the library was converted into the museum. They were missing for many years but were located intact and returned to the building in 1985. Inside was hardwood panelled walls and ceilings and oak floors. The rooms were heated by eight fireplaces. There were special reading rooms for ladies and for children, a chess room, newspaper reading room, picture gallery, lecture hall, and on the third floor the Art, Historical and Scientific Association (now called the Vancouver Museum). The library opened in November 1903.Carnegie Community Centre History This branch is now primarily used as a community centre for residents of the Downtown East Side neighbourhood. VPL moved its Central branch location from the Carnegie Library to 750 Burrard Street in 1957. The building was used as the Central branch until 1995. The Vancouver Public Library continued to occupy the Hastings and Main site until the opening of a new central library at 750 Burrard Street in 1957. The move from the Carnegie site to the new location at 750 Burrard began in mid-October 1957, and the official opening of the new library was held on November 1, 1957. The library remained at the Burrard building until April 22, 1995, when it closed in preparation for the move to a new location at Library Square (350 West Georgia Street). The central branch opened in Downtown Vancouver on May 26, 1995 and cost CAD $106.8 million to build. In September, 2009, the library cancelled a room booking made by the group Exit International to hold a workshop by Dr. Philip Nitschke about assisted suicide. The cancellation came despite months of negotiation between Exit and library administration. The library stated that it had received a legal opinion stating the workshop as described could contravene Canada's Criminal Code, but would not make the opinion public.Nitschke banned from Canada library The workshop was held at Vancouver's Unitarian Church.Suicide workshop survives cancellation \\"Whatever the reasons of the library were, it's obviously not affecting the decision by the Unitarian Church,\\" Dr. Nitschke said.

Since 2013, all branches are open at least Tuesday through Sunday.The Branch Libraries The administration centre, and also the largest branch, known as the Central Branch, is located at Library Square in downtown Vancouver. The oldest existing branch, the Kitsilano branch, is the regional reference library for the North Area division of the Libraries.The Kitsilano Branch The largest non- Central branch in terms of volumes held, is the Renfrew Branch, with 325,000 volumes. The Renfrew Branch is listed as having the largest square footage, at 16,000 square feet, while the Kensington branch at 7,100 square feet is one of the larger branch libraries. The approximate number of volumes in each VPL branch are: =Central branch= The Central branch of Vancouver Public Library is located in Downtown Vancouver. Consolidating Vancouver Public Library's Central Branch, Federal Office Tower, and retail and service facilities, the Library Square occupies a city block in Downtown Vancouver. Centred on the block, the library is a nine-story rectangular box containing book stacks and services, surrounded by a free-standing, elliptical, colonnaded wall featuring reading and study areas that are accessed by bridges spanning skylit light wells. The building is located in the eastern portion of the Vancouver Central Business District. The address of the library is 350 West Georgia Street, and the Federal office tower is addressed at 300 West Georgia Street. Levels 8 and 9 were previously leased to the Provincial government. Their address was 360 West Georgia Street. VPL Central branch internal glass facade overlooks an enclosed concourse formed by a second elliptical wall that defines the east side of the site. This glass-roofed concourse serves as an entry foyer to the library and the more lively pedestrian activities at ground level. Public spaces surrounding the library form a continuous piazza with parking located below grade. The building's exterior resembles the current appearance of the Colosseum in Rome. VPL Central branch internal glass facade overlooks an enclosed concourse formed by an elliptical wall. Adjacent to the Central Branch is Library Square, a public square is bordered by Robson Street, Homer Street, West Georgia Street, and Hamilton Street. Across West Georgia Street is Canada Post. Across Hamilton Street is the CBC Regional Broadcast Centre Vancouver. Across Homer street is The Centre in Vancouver for the Performing Arts, (formerly The Ford Centre for the Performing Arts) also designed by Moshe Safdie as a complementary building to library square. The Library Square Project was the largest capital project ever undertaken by the City of Vancouver. The decision to build the project came after a favourable public referendum in November 1990. The City then held a design competition to choose a design for the new building. The design by Moshe Safdie and DA Architects was by far the most radical design and yet was the public favourite. 70% of the public liked the Safdie scheme as a \\"unique, imaginative, exciting, interesting building.\\" The inclusion of the 21 story office tower in the design was required in order to pay for it and as part of a deal with the federal government to obtain the land; the federal government has a long term lease on the high rise office tower portion of the project. Construction began in early 1993 and was completed in 1995. In the year following the new library's opening, library visitors increased by 800,000. In addition to its function as the central branch of the city's public library system, the one square block project includes an attached office high-rise, retail shops, restaurants, and underground public parking. The Library building has a rooftop garden designed by Vancouver landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander. The roof garden is accessible by the public. The new 8,000-sq-ft rooftop garden and the expansion to Level 9 were built at a cost of $15.5 million; they opened to the public in September, 2018. The expansion is LEED Gold CIv1 certified, managed by Light House Sustainable Building Centre Access There are local bus routes that pass near Library Square including the #'s 5, 17, and 20. and North Shore routes on Georgia Street. (See the List of bus routes in Metro Vancouver) The three nearest SkyTrain stations are Granville Station, Vancouver City Centre Station and Stadium‚ÄìChinatown Station and are each within a few blocks of Library Square. Library Square is also cyclist-friendly, and has three public use bike rack stations.

He was Viscount of Aumelas and Lord of Frontignan from 1311 and claimed the title of Prince of Achaea from 1315. He was sent by Frederick III of Sicily to take command of the Catalan Company in Frederick's name, but was rebuffed by Bernat de Rocafort, one of their leaders. On his return with the chronicler Ram√≥n Muntaner, he was captured by the Venetians at Negroponte. He had been released by 1310, when he distinguished himself at the siege of Almer√≠a by killing the son of the King of Guadix. In 1313, he returned to Sicily to take part in the war then in hand with the Angevins and was created Lord of Catania. Margaret of Villehardouin was then in Sicily, seeking to advance her claim to the Principality of Achaea. She gave her daughter Isabella of Sabran to Ferdinand in marriage and resigned Akova and her claim on Achaea to the couple, who were married in Messina. Margaret died in March 1315 in captivity in Chlemoutsi, and her daughter on 7 May 1315 in Catania, shortly after bearing a son, James III of Majorca. Shortly after her death, Ferdinand set out with a small company for the Morea to uphold the claim now held by his son. He seized Clarenza in June 1315 and briefly took control of the Morea. In the autumn of 1315 he took a second wife, Isabella of Ibelin, daughter of the Seneschal of Cyprus. However, his rival claimant Matilda of Hainaut, and her husband Louis of Burgundy returned to the Morea in the spring of 1316 with Venetian aid. Ferdinand's expected aid from Majorca and Sicily was tardy, as was that of the Catalan Company from Athens. Facing superior numbers, he was killed at the Battle of Manolada, near Glarentza, on 5 July 1316. He was succeeded as heir presumptive of Majorca by his elder son, the future King James III, and as Viscount of Aumelas by his posthumous son, Ferdinand.

Early career Grigori Sokolnikov was born Girsh Yankelevich Brilliant in Romny on 15 August 1888, the son of a Jewish doctor employed by the railways. He moved to Moscow as a teenager and joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905. In 1906-07, he was based in the Sokolniki district of Moscow as a Bolshevik propagandist until autumn 1907, when mass arrests crushed the district organization, and he was detained for 18 months in solitary confinement in Butyrka prison, and sentenced to lifelong exile in Siberia. Deported in February 1909, it took four months for him to reach his assigned destination, a village called Rybnoye, on the bank of the Angara River, and six weeks to escape, via Moscow to Paris. In France, Sokolnikov obtained a doctorate in economics. He joined the 'conciliatior' Bolsheviks, who wanted to avert an outright split with the Mensheviks. During the war, he moved to Switzerland, and contributed to the newspaper Nashe Slovo, edited by Trotsky. In April 1917, Sokolnikov was a passenger in the famous sealed train that took Vladimir Lenin and other Bolsheviks across Germany to Russia.  Role in 1917  In April 1917, Sokolnikov was elected to the Moscow party committee. He backed Lenin's call for a second revolution. When Lenin was forced to go into hiding, in July, Sokolnikov moved to Petrograd, where he and Stalin were given joint control over Bolsheviks newspapers.Trotsky, L. 'A New Moscow Amalgam' in \\"Writings of Leon Trotsky (1936-37)\\", pg.120, Pathfinder, New York Elected to the Central Committee in August 1917, he was selected in October as a member of the 'Political Bureau', a forerunner of the Politburo, whose members were Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov, but the 'bureau' never met. Trotsky wrote later that it was 'completely impractical', with Lenin and Zinoviev in hiding, and Zinoviev and Kamenev opposed to the planned Bolshevik insurrection.  Brest-Litovsk Treaty  After the October Revolution, he was a member of the original delegation led by Joffe sent to Brest-Litovsk to sign a truce with Germany. When the truce broke down, and the Germans was advancing through Latvia towards Petrograd, he backed Lenin's line that the soviet government would have to capitulate, although he saw this as a delaying tactic while they created a Red Army capable of conducting a 'revolutionary war'. When the decision was made, on 24 February 1918, no-one wanted to sign the surrender, and Sokolnikov was instructed to lead the delegation, after he had tried in vain to nominate Zinoviev instead. He signed the final treaty, angrily and under protest, on 3 March, forecasting that German's expansionism would be short-lived. The German and Austrian diplomats complained that his outburst spoiled the final day of negotiations. Sokolnikov later wrote that \\"the division of labour in capitalist society was brilliantly expressed in this contrast of unceremonial plunder at the front and mannerly gentlemanliness at the green table\\". On 10 May, Sokolnikov told a meeting of the Central Committee that the Germans could not be trusted to honour the treaty, and that it had been a mistake to sign it. It required a fierce rebuttal from Lenin to avert the threat of resuming the war. Despite his intervention, in June 1918, Sokolnikov led a delegation to Berlin to negotiate a trade treaty with Germany, but the talks were aborted after the assassination of the German ambassador in Moscow, Wilhelm von Mirbach in July.  Role in the civil war  After his return from Brest, late in 1917, Sokolnikov supervised the seizure of Russian banks, and the creation of new centralised banking system. In March 1918, he was appointed an editor of Pravda, but he spent almost the entire Russian Civil War on the front line, firstly as Political commissar with the Second Army, which was responsible for putting down anti-Bolshevik rebellions on the western side of the Ural mountains, around Vyatka and Izhevsk. Two months later, after the rebellion had been crushed, he was transferred to the Southern Front, as commissar for the Ninth Army and later the Thirteenth Army, for the campaign against the Don Cossacks who had been rebelled against Bolshevik rule, and the White Army of General Denikin. Later, alongside Rosalia Zemlyachka, he became commissar of the Eighth army, using this position to order mass shootings during the Russian Civil War.Boris Bajanov, Bajanov r√©v√®le Staline, Gallimard, 1979 He was also, for a time, military commander of the Eighth Army, despite a protest from Stalin's ally Sergo Ordzhonikidze, who wrote to Lenin demanding:\\"Where did the idea come from that Sokolnikov could command an army? ... Is it to protect Sokolnikov's pride that he has been allowed to play with a whole army?\\"Grigori Sokolnikov, Mikhail Frunze and Valerian Kuybyshev head the Turkestan front. The image taken during Aug 1920 Red Army troops offensive against the city of Bukhara. In August 1920, Sokolnikov was posted to Central Asia as chairman of the government of Turkestan and commander of the Turkestan Front. He led the suppression of the Basmachi rebellion. He also oversaw the introduction of a new currency, the introduction of tax in place of appropriation of surplus produce, the return of free trade, the return of land to Kirghiz that had been seized by Russian settlers, and the revival of cotton production.  Commissar for Finance  Sokolnikov was appointed USSR Deputy People's Commissar of Finance on 10 January 1922. Since the People's Commissar, Nikolai Krestinsky had been appointed Ambassador to Germany, he was in fact in charge of Narkomfin from that time. In March 1922, he was re- elected to the Central Committee (from which he had been dropped in 1920) and in the autumn he was formally appointed as People's Commissar. This role made him central to the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP). More than anyone else, he is credited with introducing a stable currency to end the economic chaos of the civil war years. He proposed the introduction of a new currency in the month when he first took office. The 'gold bank notes' or chervontsi were issued by the state bank in November 1922. During 1922, Sokolnikov argued persistently in favour of relaxing the state monopoly on foreign trade, to allow some of the private enterprises that came into existence under NEP to import equipment sell their produce abroad without going through government agencies. He was supported by Stalin, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin - i.e. by a majority of the Politburo - but met vehement opposition from Lenin, who warned: \\"Sokolnikov is making a great mistake, which is sure to ruin us, unless the C.C. corrects his line in time, and actually secures implementation of the corrected line. His mistake is abstract enthusiasm for a scheme (something of which Sokolnikov has always been guilty, as a talented journalist and a politician who is easily carried away).\\" In October 1922, Sokolnikov persuaded the Central Committee to agree to partially lift the monopoly, provoking an angry reaction from Lenin, who missed the meeting through illness. He accused Sokolnikov of being someone who \\"likes paradoxes\\". The Central Committee backed down in December, after Trotsky - who also missed the October meeting - had backed Lenin. Speaking to the 11th Congress of the CPSU in March 1922, Sokolnikov flatly contradicted those who suggested that the state should print more paper money to finance the revival of war-damaged industry, likening it to poisoning the system by injecting opium. More controversially, he warned that many factories were losing money and living off the state, and would have to pay their way by selling products in the new free market conditions of NEP.Grigori Sokolnikov, People's Commissar for Finance of the USSR, marked (1) negotiates in Berlin Sep 1923He became a candidate member of the Politburo of the Communist Party in May 1924. According to Boris Bajanov, as minister of finance Sokolnikov proved himself to be a capable administrator, accomplishing every task he was asked to do, such as creating the first stable Soviet currency. Bajanov also notes that despite Sokolnikov's past in the Red Army, he was not ruthless in his personality. Privately, Sokolnikov lost faith in the Soviet Union under Stalin and later described the Soviet economy as state capitalist.  Family  In 1925, Sokolnikov married the writer Galina Serebryakova. They had a daughter, Geliana, born in 1934.  Opposition to Stalin  On 5 September 1925, Sokolnikov signed the unpublished 'Platform of the Four', a joint protest by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya against Stalin's leadership. His decision seems to have been personal than political, because politically he was on the right of the party, whereas Zinoviev and Kamenev were about to join Trotsky in the United Opposition. He appears to have been motivated by mistrust of Stalin, and friendship with Kamenev. Even while publicly aligned with the opposition, he continued to argue that agricultural output had to be increased before industry could be expanded, and that consumer goods should be imported to give the peasants an incentive to take their produce to market. He was also openly dismissive of the figures produced by Gosplan, believing that 'state capitalism' properly managed would be more efficient that a centrally planned economy. In October 1926, the six principal leaders of the opposition, including Sokolnikov, signed a promise to follow the party line in future. He kept to this line, unlike the others but was removed from the Politburo nonetheless, in January 1926, while being allowed to retain his membership of the Central Committee. In the same month, he was removed from the post of People's Commissar for finance, and appointed Deputy Chairman of Gosplan, despite his well known scepticism about the value of central planning. In spring 1926, he was sent on a trade mission to the US, which aborted when he was denied a visa. In March 1928, when the Central Committee discussed the food crisis - to which Stalin reacted later in the year by sending shock troops into the villages to collect grain by force - Sokolnikov made a speech in which, while admitting that he had been wrong in the past, he stuck to his earlier beliefs by arguing that the way to get peasants to sell their produce was to raise the price of grain. However, after the introduction of the First five-year plan, he defended the principle that it was possible and necessary for the state to intervene and plan economic output. He wrote: In July 1928, Sokolnikov and Bukharin were returning to the Kremlin from a Central Committee plenum when they encountered Kamenev, and Bukharin talked indiscreetly about the gathering opposition to Stalin within the Politburo. In February 1929, Sokolnikov was formally rebuked by the Politburo for being present during this conversation, after a transcript had been published abroad. He was removed from his post in Gosplan. From 1929 to 1932, Sokolnikov was the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, where the newly elected Labour government had extended diplomatic recognition to the USSR. Speaking very little English, he had limited contacts with leading British politicians. Beatrice Webb who invited Sokolnikov and his wife to her home and introduced him to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden noted in her diary: ‚ÄúWe are the only ‚ÄòCabinet‚Äô members who have consorted with them. The Hendersons do not ‚Äòknow them‚Äô socially, nor the PM.\\" In 1932, Sokolnikov was recalled to Moscow (and replaced by Ivan Maisky, who spoke fluent English) and appointed Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs.  Arrest and execution  The British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, who had met Sokolnikov in England, visited his Moscow flat just before the start of the Great Purge. He wrote later: Sokolnikov was arrested on 26 July 1936. He was sufficiently broken under interrogation, either through torture or more probably through threats to harm his young wife and daughter, that he not only incriminated himself, but was made to confront Bukharin, in Lazar Kaganovich's office, and accuse him of being part of a conspiracy to restore capitalism in the USSR. Bukharin shouted at him \\"Have you lost your reason?\\" - but Sokolnikov, whose face was \\"pale but not tortured\\" stuck to his story. In January 1937, he was a defendant at the Trial of the Seventeen at which he 'confessed' that he had been party to a terrorist plot against Stalin since 1932, and that Trotsky was conspiring with Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess to incite a Nazi invasion of the USSR. He was sentenced to ten years in the Gulag. Even at the time, there were Soviet citizens who were not taken in by the trial and the forced confessions, such as the writer Isaac Babel, who was reported to the NKVD for saying, in private conversation with the film director Sergei Eisenstein \\"Lenin was very fond of Sokolnikov because he's a very smart man...and his whole struggle is the struggle against Stalin's influence.\\" Reportedly, Sokolnikov was assassinated in a prison by other convicts on 21 May 1939. A post-Stalin official investigation during the Khrushchev Thaw revealed that the murder was organized by the NKVD official and ordered by Lavrenty Beria and Joseph Stalin personally.

The company is headquartered in Ankeny, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines. As of April 30, 2019, Casey's had 2,146 stores in 16 states. History In 1959, Donald Lamberti leased a service station in Des Moines, Iowa, from his father. After successfully remodeling the station into a convenience store and operating it for nine years, his gasoline supplier and friend, Kurvin C. (K.C.) Fish, suggested that he purchase the Square Deal Oil Company, a service station available for sale in Boone, Iowa. Lamberti followed Fish's advice and purchased the station, which he renamed \\"Casey's\\" after Fish and as with his leased store converted the station into a convenience store. The logo on the Boone store is the same logo used today by the Casey's chain. The Boone store (located in a town of only 12,500) did well, so Lamberti decided to see if he could duplicate his success. He built another store in Creston, Iowa (population 7,000) and that store did well also. Lamberti became more ambitious and decided to open a store from scratch in the even smaller town of Waukee, Iowa (population 1,500 at the time). The Waukee store proved to be the most successful of the three, so Lamberti decided to purchase and open more stores, concentrating on towns of less than 5,000 population (a variation on the tactic used in the early success of Wal-Mart). =1970s‚Äì1990s= By the late 1970s (when Casey's opened its first warehouse) the chain had 118 stores, including the original store operated by Lamberti's parents which entered the Casey's fold in 1977. In 1982, Casey's opened its first Distribution Center in Urbandale, Iowa. Casey's became a publicly traded company in October, 1983, with an initial public offering of 700,000 shares. Around this time Casey's began to sell doughnuts in its stores; in December 1984 it introduced pizza into its stores (which is one of its signature items today). In 1990, Casey's moved to its current facility in Ankeny, Iowa. Casey's 1,000th store opened in Altoona, Iowa in 1996, the same year Casey's exceeded US$1 billion in annual sales. =2000‚Äìpresent= In January 2006, Casey's purchased Lincoln, Nebraska-based Gas 'N Shop. On August 7, 2006, Casey's agreed to purchase the 33-store HandiMart chain, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a $63 million deal. In March 2010, Alimentation Couche-Tard (operator of several convenience store chains, including Circle K) offered $1.9 billion for control of the company, and later announced a proxy fight for control. Casey's rejected Couche-Tard's offer and was successful in September 2010 in retaining its board of directors vs. Couche-Tard's nominated slate. While Casey's and Couche-Tard were battling for company control, in September 2010, 7-Eleven offered a $2 billion bid for control of the company. Casey's and 7-Eleven engaged in discussions, but in November 2010 elected not to proceed with a merger. Casey's announced in 2017 that it plans to open about 10 new locations in western Ohio. Casey's announced plans in August 2018 to build a store in Huber Heights, Ohio. In 2018 Casey's announced under increasing pressure from outside investors to adopt a range of new digital initiatives including a new Fleet Card, Mobile App, and loyalty program for Casey customers. The CEO announced in late 2018 the initiative would be complete by Quarter 1 of 2020. In October 2020, Casey's announced a rebranding, including a new logo and dropping 'General Stores' from its name.

Name connotations Out of respect for the Apostle Saint Peter, the first pope, no pope has ever adopted the name Peter II. It is considered unlikely that any future pope would choose the name. Many popes have, however, had the saint's name as their baptismal name, most recently Benedict XIII (Pietro Orsini). The likelihood of such a choice is further diminished by the final passage of the Prophecy of the Popes attributed to St. Malachy, a text which is well known in Catholic circles, though having no official standing. The prophecy refers to a Petrus Romanus (Peter the Roman) as the final pope: he would \\"feed his sheep in many tribulations\\" and in the days of the \\"final persecution.\\" This text invests the name of Peter II with an apocalyptic connotation. Use The name Peter II has been adopted by several modern-day conclavists who claim to be the legitimate pope, particularly those whose claim to the papacy derives from a claimed personal divine revelation. Pope Peter II is the name assumed by Manuel Alonso Corral who is the second pope of the Palmarian Catholic Church, a small schismatic Traditionalist Catholic church with an episcopal see headquartered in El Palmar de Troya, Spain. Coral (Pope Peter II) succeeded Clemente Dom√≠nguez y G√≥mez the initial Pope known as Pope Gregory XVII. Corral as Pope Peter II ruled for more than 6 years from 22 March 2005 to 15 July 2011 and was succeeded by Gin√©s Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez known as Pope Gregory XVIII. The incumbent pope of the church Joseph Odermatt is known as Pope Peter III. Fiction In the Left Behind series, Peter Mathews, a corrupt Catholic bishop, is elected pope and takes the name Peter II, subsequently becoming a leader of the Enigma Babylon One World Faith. In The Third Secret by Steve Berry, an ambitious Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, is elected pope and chooses the name Peter II. The novel The Accidental Pope by Raymond Flynn and Robin Moore (2000) has a widowed American fisherman with four children elected pope by a fluke.Holy See! Review by Alessandra Stanley He chooses the name Peter II in honor of Pope Peter I, who he describes as also having been a fisherman who had been married. The Fifth Seal: The Rise of Petrus Romanus by Dennis R. Berry portrays Cardinal Vitale Milani, an evil and ambitious man who stops at nothing to assume the papacy, including mass murder. He chooses Peter II as his papal name. In A Short Story of the Anti- Christ by Russian Orthodox philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, Cardinal Simon Barionini is elected Peter II. No direct mention is made of the Prophecy of the Popes, but he, along with the Orthodox Elder John and the Protestant Professor Ernst Pauli, leads the reunited Christian Churches against the titular Emperor in the Battle of Armageddon.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 18, 2001\\\\. In the episode, Krusty announces his retirement due to interference from network executives and the growing popularity of the game show Me Wantee. When Krusty reveals that all of the episodes featuring Sideshow Bob have been erased, Bob hypnotizes Bart into murdering Krusty during his farewell show. \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" was written by Al Jean and directed by Michael Marcantel and features recurring guest star Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob, as well as Gary Coleman as himself. It features references to Johnny Carson, Bookends and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, among other things. It would also feature a parody of the song \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\", but because the series' staff were not able to clear the rights for the song in time for the episode's broadcast, the song remained unreleased until 2007. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 9 million viewers, finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its broadcast, the episode received positive reviews from critics. Plot When the popular game show Me Wantee! steals ratings from The Krusty the Clown Show, Krusty, annoyed with the network executives, announces his fifth--and final--retirement. During an interview with Kent Brockman, he says he is tired of doing his show, and admits to taping Judge Judy over all his old shows featuring Sideshow Bob. Upon hearing this on TV, Bob vows revenge and plots to kill Krusty. Bob is released from prison and applies for a job at Springfield Elementary as an assistant janitor. However, Principal Skinner decides to make him the morning announcer. Over the announcements, he asks Bart to meet him in the abandoned tool shed. Sideshow Bob then hypnotizes Bart, and starts to program him to kill Krusty on sight. Bob tests his hypnoses by having Bart smash a statue of Krusty at a local Krusty Burger location. The next night is Krusty's farewell special, and as Krusty describes the history of his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of Bob, stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is touched and develops a change of heart, but does not have enough time to stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, breaking Bart's hypnotic state and killing all the executives, though they then reanimate themselves like the T-1000. After the show, the Simpsons have dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, the police decide to execute Bob by guillotine for his attempted murder plot, although he wonders to Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for it at least. Production The writers wanted another Sideshow Bob episode so they could work with Kelsey Grammer again The first draft of \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" was written by current showrunner Al Jean. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean said that he had always wanted to write an episode about Sideshow Bob, and that \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" would be a good way to have the character return. He also said that the writers wanted to work with Kelsey Grammer, who portrays Sideshow Bob, again. \\"Of all the guest stars we've had who've been great, he's right up there as the very best\\", he said.Jean, Al. (2009). Commentary for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Still, the writers had trouble with coming up with a story for Sideshow Bob since they had already explored several aspects of the character before. \\"It's just that we've done so many angles of whether he's, he's good, he's reformed and then his brother came to town...\\" executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said about the difficulty of writing episodes about Sideshow Bob. At the beginning of the episode, Krusty is shown being pestered by network executives who comment on every choice he makes. He announces his departure from the Krusty the Klown Show after the executives give him notes during filming of a sketch. At the end of the episode, Mr Teeny is uncertain of where he should throw the plastic explosives that Bart wore. When he sees the two executives discussing in a room, he throws it onto them. Instead of dying of the explosion however, the pieces of the executives reconstitute into what Jean describes as a \\"super-executive\\". These sequences were inspired by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series he was working on before he returned to The Simpsons in 1999. \\"I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where there were a lot of notes from executives\\", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. The episode would originally have a different ending, but it was changed to its current iteration after the writers did not find the original ending humorous enough. When recording the DVD commentary however, Jean said that he was a bit dissatisfied with the new ending. \\"I think we did leave it a little hanging\\", he said. During one of the recording sessions for the episode, The Simpsons' staff recorded \\"Hullaba Lula\\", a version of the 1946 song \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" with Grammer as Sideshow Bob on vocals. The song would originally be used in the episode, but the staff were not able to clear the rights for the song in time. It was therefore removed from the episode altogether, and remained unreleased until September 17, 2007, when it was included as a bonus track on the soundtrack album The Simpsons: Testify. Aside from Grammer, the episode also features American actor Gary Coleman as himself.Selman, Matt. (2009). Commentary for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cultural references The plot of \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" is based on the 1959 political thriller novel The Manchurian Candidate. Before filming an episode of his show, Krusty is stopped by the two network executives, who attempt to explain to him why the sitcom Seinfeld worked as a series.Long, Tim. (2009). Commentary for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. After Krusty has announced the cancellation of his show, a group of crying children are seen at the Krustylu Studios, where the show is filmed. The name of the studio is based on Desilu Studios, a television company based in Los Angeles. In an interview with Kent Brockman, Krusty says that he taped over all episodes of his show that Sideshow Bob was in with episodes of the reality court show Judge Judy. This is a reference to how NBC reused tapes of early episodes of The Tonight Show to film new programs. While in the Springfield Elementary School's tool-shed, Sideshow Bob accidentally steps on a rake and says \\"Rakes, my old arch-enemy.\\" This is a reference to the scene, in the season 5 episode \\"Cape Feare\\", where Sideshow Bob steps on rakes a ridiculous number of times. At one point in his last show, Krusty performs while sitting on a stool, a reference to television host Johnny Carson's last appearance on The Tonight Show. While watching Krusty's final show, Sideshow Bob holds a bag of Kettle Chips and says \\"Kettle Chips, the perfect sidedish for revenge.\\" Because of this scene, the writing staff received several bags of Kettle Chips from Kettle Foods, according to Jean. When asking for Sideshow Bob's forgiveness, Krusty sings a song to the tune of \\"Mandy\\" by Barry Manilow. The picture behind him is based on the cover of Bookends by Simon & Garfunkel. After having exploded, the two network executives reform into a \\"super- executive\\". The scene is a reference to the 1991 science fiction action film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Another reference to Terminator 2 is found earlier in the episode when Krusty drives a golf cart away from the network executives and one of them tries to cling on with golf clubs, similar to the T-1000. At the end of the episode, Krusty and Sideshow Bob reconcile in a restaurant. On the wall behind them are several pictures of guest stars that had previously appeared on The Simpsons, including Mark McGwire, Ringo Starr, Sting, Tom Jones, Brooke Shields and Elizabeth Taylor. Release In its original American broadcast on February 18, 2001, \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" received an 8.8 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 9 million viewers. The episode finished in 34th place in the ratings for the week of February 12‚Äì18, 2001, tying with an episode of Malcolm in the Middle. On August 18, 2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Mike Scully, Al Jean, Ian Maxtone- Graham, Yeardley Smith, Tim Long, Matt Selman and Michael Marcantel participated in the audio commentary for the episode.Scully, Mike. (2009). Commentary for \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Following its home video release, \\"Day of the Jackanapes\\" received positive reviews from critics. In his review of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict described the episode as a \\"winner\\". He especially enjoyed the scene in which Bart hits a statue of Krusty in the groin with a baseball bat. DVD Talk's Jason Bailey wrote that this episode and \\"Insane Clown Poppy\\" both \\"really shine\\", and Will Harris of Bull-Eye.com wrote that the episode was \\"a crowd-pleaser across the board.\\" Colin Jacobson, of DVD Movie Guide wrote that, although it does not compare with the best Sideshow Bob episodes, it still \\"looks good\\" compared to the rest of the season. He enjoyed the lampooning of network executives, and though he did not consider the episode to be a \\"classic\\", he maintained that it \\"fares pretty well.\\" IGN's Robert Canning also wrote that, although the episode is overall \\"solid\\", it is \\"lacking that extra something\\" that the best Sideshow Bob episodes have. Nevertheless, it reached number eight on the website's list of ten best Sideshow Bob episodes of the series.

Defining attributes Physical force Irish republicanism has usually been marked by a number of features: * A commitment to an Irish republic which stresses the rights of the Irish people as a community, agitating for independence and the ownership of Ireland rather than to individual rights, such as private property rights; * The holding of a series of rebellions or campaigns, sometimes with minimal support, but some of which impacted upon parliamentary nationalism; * A demand to break all links with the United Kingdom through the use of force. * The use of secret societies to plot and organise rebellions; especially the Fenians/Irish Republican Brotherhood. The most prominent physical force rebellions and campaigns were: * 1798 rebellion of Wolfe Tone and the Society of United Irishmen * 1803 rebellion associated with Robert Emmet and the United Irishmen * 1848 rebellion associated with Thomas Davis, Charles Gavan Duffy and the Young Ireland movement * 1867 rebellion associated with James Stephens, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa and the Irish Republican Brotherhood * 1867‚Äì1885 Fenian dynamite campaign associated with the Irish Republican Brotherhood * 1916 Easter Rising associated with Padraig Pearse and James Connolly * 1919‚Äì21 Irish War of Independence * 1922‚Äì23 Irish Civil War * 1939‚Äì1941 Sabotage Campaign (Irish Republican Army) * 1942‚Äì1944 Northern Campaign (Irish Republican Army) * 1956‚Äì1962 Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army) * 1969‚Äì97 Provisional IRA campaign 1969‚Äì1997 during The TroublesNorthern Ireland (Hot Spots in Global Politics series) by Jonathan Tonge (), page 39 * 1998-present Dissident Irish Republican campaign History It was the Volunteers of 1782 which would launch a paramilitary tradition in Irish politics; a tradition, whether nationalist or unionist, that has continued to shape Irish political activity with the ethos of \\"the force of argument had been trumped by the argument of force\\". Irish republicanism an offspring of the Volunteers of 1782, owes much to influences of both the American and French revolutions. The United Irishmen of 1798 were a mass movement, largely led by liberal Protestants, who desired to \\"break the connection with England\\" and found a non-sectarian Irish Republic. To this end, they secured French military aid and launched their own rebellion. Robert Emmet's abortive rebellion of 1803 was essentially an aftershock of the 1798 rebellion. It was confined to a skirmish in Dublin, after which Emmet was hanged. The Young Ireland rebellion of 1848 was launched in frustration with the failure of Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association movement to secure the repeal of the Union, or self- government for Ireland. The Young Irelanders had previously supported O'Connell until he cancelled plans for a mass rally under British threat of force. The 1848 rebellion was a failure, launched during the Great Irish Famine, it did not address any of the social and economic questions of the day, and weaken the strength of the parliamentary movement of the recently deceased Daniel O'Connell. The 1867 rebellion of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) was the culmination of several years of agitation by this secret, oath-bound organisation. The IRB, or Fenians, planned a national insurrection and the foundation of an Irish Republic with the aid of radicalised Irish units in the British Army. Although the Fenians had some success in infiltrating army units and had a considerable presence in parts of Ireland, the British took steps to remove seditious army units from Ireland and the rebellion was launched against the better judgement of the IRB leadership on the urgings of the American-based Fenian Brotherhood. It was unsuccessful in a military sense with only isolated skirmishes taking place but did become a focal point in Irish revolutionary folklore, inspiring later generations of rebels. Clan na Gael later conducted several bombing attacks in England and attempted to free their imprisoned allies. One such raid resulted in the hanging of three IRB men, known as the \\"Manchester Martyrs\\", for the killing of a policeman. The 1916 Easter Rising was launched by the IRB, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army. It had a dramatic impact in achieving Irish independence: Arthur Griffith continued his \\"doctrinaire commitment\\" to terror bombings as IRB policy.Charles Townshend, \\"The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence\\", p.53. Though support for the insurgents was small, the execution of fifteen people by firing squad, the imprisonment or internment of hundreds more, and the imposition of martial law caused a profound shift in public opinion towards the republican cause in Ireland.Marie Coleman, The Republican Revolution, 1916-1923, Routledge, 2013, chapter 2 \\"The Easter Rising\\", pp. 26‚Äì8. It allowed the surviving rising leader √âamon de Valera to win a majority for the anti-occupation Sinn F√©in party in the 1918 general election, which became the defining moment of the physical force doctrine.Charles Townshend, \\"The Republic: The Fight for Irish Independence\\" (London 2014), p. 55. Sinn F√©in then declared the Irish Republic to be in existence. Its parliament, the First D√°il first met in January 1919, and the British declared it an illegal assembly shortly afterwards. At around the same time, the Volunteers, now organised as the Irish Republican Army began a guerrilla war, the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì21), against the British Government in Ireland. By July 1921, the campaign had brought the British Government to the conclusion that it would have to negotiate with the D√°il to end the violence. The war was ended with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created an independent Irish dominion known as the Irish Free State for 26 of Ireland's 32 counties. The remaining 6 were to remain in the UK as Northern Ireland. The Treaty was narrowly passed in the D√°il in January 1922. While the leadership of the IRA, Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy, in the forefront in accepting the treaty, the majority of the Army did not accept the abolition of the Irish Republic and abandonment of the First D√°il. In April 1922, they formed their own \\"Army Executive\\" and renounced the authority of the D√°il to accept the Treaty. Political leaders such as √âamon de Valera and Cathal Brugha, also unhappy with the Treaty, supported their actions. These tensions ultimately plunged the new Irish state into civil war (1922‚Äì1923). Ultimately, the Irish Free State put down the Anti-treaty IRA and ended the war by May 1923, though not before the deaths of many of those who had fought together in 1919‚Äì1921. Physical force republicanism continued on after 1923. As a result of the Treaty and the Civil War, Republicans saw both states in Ireland as being British imposed \\"imperialist\\" proxies. However, by the 1930s the bulk of the Civil War Anti-Treaty republicans had accepted the Irish Free state and entered its government as Fianna F√°il. The remnants of the IRA continued to see themselves as the Army of the Irish Republic, temporarily suppressed by force of arms (though they too banned armed action by their members against the southern Irish state in 1948). They launched unsuccessful armed campaigns in England in the 1940s and in Northern Ireland in the 1950s aimed at achieving a United Ireland. The Irish Republican Army (1922‚Äì69) and its political wing, Sinn F√©in went through periodic splits, most dramatically in 1969 when two IRAs emerged, the Official IRA (OIRA) and the Provisional IRA (PIRA), along with two Sinn F√©ins; Sinn F√©in ‚Äì Gardiner Place or Official Sinn F√©in and Sinn F√©in ‚Äì Kevin St or Provisional Sinn F√©in. While the \\"Official\\" republican movement wanted to move away from traditional physical force republicanism and towards Marxist political activism,Mallie and Bishop, pp. 52‚Äì54 the \\"Provisionals\\", reacting to the outbreak of communal violence in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, wanted to first defend the Catholic population of the North from attack and then launch an armed offensive against British rule there. The PIRA proceeded to do this from 1969 until 1997 (see Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997), when it called a ceasefire. The PIRA is responsible for roughly 1,800 deaths in the \\"Troubles\\". Its political wing, Sinn F√©in entered negotiations towards a political settlement in Northern Ireland. In 2005 Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams called on the Provisional IRA to move from physical force activity to exclusively democratic means.Adams calls on IRA to end armed struggle Three months later the IRA Army Council announced an end to the IRA's armed campaign, stating that it would work to achieve its aims using \\"purely political and democratic programmes through exclusively peaceful means\\" and that IRA \\"Volunteers must not engage in any other activities whatsoever.\\" Patrick Pearse \\"President of the Provisional Government\\", leader of the 1916 Rising The \\"Officials\\" eventually abandoned militarism altogether but not before spawning a militant splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1974 and its political wing the Irish Republican Socialist Party. The INLA is a Marxist revolutionary group and has carried out over 100 killings during the Northern Ireland conflict. It has been on a \\"no first strike\\" ceasefire since 1998. When Sinn F√©in voted to recognise the D√°il of the Republic of Ireland and enter it (if elected) in 1986, a small group that included many of the founders of the Provisional movement broke away from Sinn F√©in and the Provisional IRA and formed Republican Sinn F√©in and its own small Continuity IRA. They continue to oppose both states in Ireland. Another small splinter group emerged from the Provisional IRA in 1998, when it was clear that the organisation was preparing to accept a political solution short of a united Ireland. This group of disaffected PIRA members called themselves the Real IRA and want to continue \\"armed struggle\\" against British rule in Northern Ireland. Neither the CIRA nor the RIRA have the support, numbers or capability once possessed by the Provisional IRA. Propaganda During the Troubles, Sinn F√©in presented republican political violence as a \\"force of nature\\" caused by British rule in Ireland, which would continue until the reunification of Ireland. This idea is encapsulated by Patrick Pearse's axiom, \\"Ireland unfree shall never be at peace\\".

Plot \\"Big John\\" McMasters (Clark Gable) and \\"Square John\\" Sand (Spencer Tracy) are two down- on-their-luck oil wildcatters who join forces. Without enough money, they steal drilling equipment from a skeptical Luther Aldrich (Frank Morgan). Their well proves a bust and they have to hastily depart when Aldrich shows up with the sheriff to take back his property. The two oilmen team up and make enough money to partially pay Aldrich. To get him to back them for a second try, they cut him in for a percentage of the well. This time, they strike it rich. When Elizabeth 'Betsy' Bartlett (Claudette Colbert) shows up, McMasters sweeps her off her feet (without knowing that Sand considers her his girl) and marries her. Sand accepts the situation, wanting Betsy to be happy. However, on their first anniversary, she catches her husband dancing with a barroom floozy. As a result, Sand quarrels with McMasters and they flip a coin for the entire oilfield. Betsy leaves too, but returns when she learns that her husband has lost almost everything to Sand and needs her. Each man goes through booms and busts. Building on his renewed success as a wildcatter, McMasters moves to New York to expand into refineries and distribution, competing against former customer Harry Compton (Lionel Atwill). Seeking inside information about his rivals, he hires away Compton's adviser Karen Vanmeer (Hedy Lamarr), who uses her social contacts and womanly charms to gather industry information. Meanwhile, Sand loses everything he has built up in South America to a revolution. When he meets McMasters at an oilmen's convention, the two finally reconcile, and Sand goes to work for his old friend. When he suspects that McMasters is carrying on an affair with Karen, he tries to save Betsy's marriage by offering to marry Karen. However, she deduces his motives and declines. When a miserable Betsy tries to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills, Sand decides that the only way to help her is to bankrupt McMasters. Sand loses his costly battle with his former friend and goes broke. It is only when he asks McMasters to give his wife a divorce that the married man finally comes to his senses. Later, McMasters is prosecuted by the government for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and loses his business. In the end, poor, but happier, Sand and McMasters team up again, with the blissful Betsy looking on. Aldrich supplies them with equipment and the whole cycle begins again.

Reception =Critical= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the scenes involving the oil wells as exciting but found the human part of the story \\"peters out into repetitious wrangling along monotonous lines.\\" Variety's review was positive, writing: \\"Unlike many large-budgeted productions carrying multistar setups that tend either to costume background or sophistication for limited appeal, this one breaks out with a dashing, rough-and-tumble yarn of modern adventure that carries all elements for widest audience appeal ... story is repetitious in its cutbacks to new oil fields and gushers, but this fact will be considered unimportant by the customers.\\" Harrison's Reports accurately predicted that the film's star power would make it a big hit, but said the story was \\"only fairly good\\" and the plot \\"somewhat thin.\\" Film Daily called the screenplay \\"excellent\\" and wrote that Conway \\"has furnished an outstanding job of directing, blending the action, love interest and comedy so that interest is held to the end.\\" John Mosher wrote a mixed review for The New Yorker, stating that \\"when the plot leaves the West and comes East, it grows rather feeble. Western bars, these boom towns and their peculiar architecture and their customs, and the spectacle of the great oil gushers themselves form a substantial background of interest, I should say, which a commonplace plot merely frames.\\" =Box office= Boom Town was the highest-grossing film of 1940 and was second only to Gone with the Wind in generating ticket sales for a Clark Gable picture. According to MGM records the film earned $3,664,000 in the US and Canada and $1,365,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,892,000. Awards and honors Boom Town was nominated for two Oscars, for Best Black and White Cinematography and Best Special Photographic Effects (A. Arnold Gillespie, Douglas Shearer).

This colorless gas is used as a refrigerant, where it is often listed as R-152a (refrigerant-152a) or HFC-152a (hydrofluorocarbon-152a). It is also used as a propellant for aerosol sprays and in gas duster products. As an alternative to chlorofluorocarbons, it has an ozone depletion potential of zero, a lower global warming potential (124) and a shorter atmospheric lifetime (1.4 years). dead link 18 February 2019 Production 1,1-Difluoroethane is produced by the mercury-catalyzed addition of hydrogen fluoride to acetylene: :HCCH + 2 HF ‚Üí CHCHF The intermediate in this process is vinyl fluoride (C2H3F), the monomeric precursor to polyvinyl fluoride. Uses With a relatively low global warming potential (GWP) index of 124 and favorable thermophysical properties, 1,1-difluoroethane has been proposed as an environmentally friendly alternative to R134a. Despite its flammability, it also presents operating pressures and volumetric cooling capacity (VCC) similar to R134a so it can be used in large chillers or in more particular applications like heat pipe finned heat exchangers. Furthermore, 1,1-difluoroethane is also commonly used in gas dusters and many consumer aerosol products, especially those subject to stringent volatile organic compound (VOC) requirements. The molecular weight of difluoroethane is 66, making it a useful and convenient tool for detecting vacuum leaks in GC-MS systems. The cheap and freely available gas has a molecular weight and fragmentation pattern (base peak 51 m/z in typical EI-MS, major peak at 65 m/z) distinct from anything in air. If mass peaks corresponding to 1,1-difluoroethane are observed immediately after spraying a suspect leak point, leaks may be identified. Safety Difluoroethane is an intoxicant and precipitates fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Several reports of fatal car crashes have been linked to drivers huffing 1,1-difluoroethane. Actress Skye McCole Bartusiak died due to combined effects of difluoroethane and other drugs. Because of inhalant abuse, a bitterant is added to some brands; however even this measure is not legally required and has not prevented widespread use of this product as a drug. In a DuPont study, rats were exposed to up to 25,000 ppm (67,485 mg/m) for six hours daily, five days a week for two years. This has become the no-observed-adverse-effect level for this substance.

Tract housing is a type of housing development in which multiple similar homes are built on a tract (area) of land that is subdivided into individual small lots. Tract housing developments are found in world suburb developments that were modeled on the \\"Levittown\\" concept and sometimes encompass large areas of dozens of square miles. Design Tract housing evolved in the 1940s when the demand for cheap housing rocketed. Economies of scale meant that large numbers of identical homes could be built faster and more cheaply to fulfil the growing demand. Developers would purchase a dozen or more adjacent lots and conduct the building construction as an assembly-line process. Tract housing development makes use of few architectural designs, and labor costs are reduced because workers need to learn the skills and movements of constructing only those designs rather than repeat the learning curve. In addition, as all homes in the development will be built at the same time, the cost of purchasing and transporting building supplies may be reduced due to economies of scale. Components such as roof trusses, plumbing, and stair systems are often prefabricated in factories and installed on-site. This allows builders to offer lower prices, which in turn can make homes affordable to a larger percentage of the population. Early tract homes were often identical, but many tracts since the late 20th century have several designs and other variations in footprint, roof form, and materials, along with options such as garage bays, for a more diverse appearance. Suburbs A tract housing development in San Jose, California, United States The concept of tract housing is occasionally mocked in North American popular culture as the basis of suburbia; notable examples are the songs \\"Little Boxes\\" by Malvina Reynolds, \\"Suburbia\\" by the Pet Shop Boys and \\"Subdivisions\\" by Rush. It is also often criticized by city planners and architects, as its construction tends to overlook required elements of successful community building, instead creating a homogeneous residential neighborhood with no local employment, commerce, services, or attractions within close commuting distance. This leads to a heavy reliance on automobile travel, as residents are unable to address any of these needs locally.

He is related to both the Spanish royal family (House of Borb√≥n- Anjou) and to France's House of Orl√©ans. In 2016 he sold the priceless family art collection held in the Czartoryski Museum to the Polish state for a nominal price of about $100 million. Origins Adam Karol Czartoryski is the son of Prince Augustyn J√≥zef Czartoryski (1907‚Äì1946) and Princess Mar√≠a de los Dolores of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. Through his mother, he is the first cousin of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. He is the head of the Polish House of Czartoryski, descendants of Gediminas (died 1341), ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Czartoryski rose to power under August Aleksander Czartoryski (1697‚Äì1782) of the Klewa line, who married Countess Zofia von D√∂nhoff, the only heir to the Sieniawski family. The Czartoryski and the Potocki were the two most influential aristocratic families of the last decades of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1795). Family tree Biography At the start of World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the Germans occupied Poland in September 1939. The Gestapo arrested Prince Agustyn and Princess Dolores, who was pregnant with Prince Adam Karol. Through their connections to Italian and Spanish royalty they arranged to be deported to Spain. Adam Karol Czartoryski was born on 2 January 1940 in Seville, Spain. Adam Karol's brother Ludwik Piotr was born in 1945. Prince Agustyn and Ludwik Piotr both died in 1946 and were buried in the crypt of the Silesian Church in Seville. Adam Karol Czartoryski was educated in Spain and then in England. He lived in Ireland for a while, where he became a professional race car driver and an enthusiast of karate. He was a great admirer of Hawaiian Kenp≈ç grand master Ed Parker. He trained in Kenp≈ç Karate with John McSweeney, a pupil of Ed Parker. Returning to his native Spain at the end of the sixties, Czartoryski continued his Karate training under the guidance of Japanese Sensei Yasunari Ishimi. He reached the 5th Dan of karate. Czartoryski was director of several international karate organizations. He also supported conventional wrestling and judo. In 1976 the Chinese government gave sports medals to Adan Czartoryski Bourbon and Fernando Compte, president of the Spanish Wrestling Association. In 1982 Czartoryski was elected vice-president of the World Karate Federation and the European Karate Federation. In 1984 he was a member of the Spanish Olympic Committee (COE) for karate by virtue of his positions in the karate federations. As of 2020 he was honorary president of the International Budo Academy, which trains teachers of martial arts (Bud≈ç). In 1974 Czartoryski became head trustee of the Polish Dzialynska Trust, set up by his family in Norwich, England in 1899 to support Polish students in the United Kingdom and in Poland. On 25 January 1977 he married Nora de Piccioto in London. Their daughter Tamara Laura Czartoryska was born on 25 April 1978. The couple divorced in 1986. Lady with ermine by Leonardo da Vinci, the most famous of the works in the Czartoryski Collection In 1989, after the fall of the Polish People's Republic, Czartoryski was able to visit Poland for the first time. In 1991 the Republic of Poland recognized him for his philanthropy and awarded him the Commander‚Äôs Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta. That year the Polish government restored ownership of the family art collection and library to Czartoryski. It had been managed by the National Museum of Poland in Krak√≥w, which continued to manage the collection. In 1992 Czartoryski represented Poland at the opening of \\"Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration\\" at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. Later that year he was in charge of the Polish Pavilion at the Seville Expo '92. In 1997 Czartoryski noticed the sale at Sotheby's of a painting by the Dutch artist Jan Mostaert named Portrait of a Lady, Presumably Anne of Bretagne, which he claimed to have come from his family's looted art collection. The owner said his mother had bought the painting in the 1950s for $6,000 from a reputable New York art gallery. A legal battle started to determine the rightful owner. Czartoryski's mother, Princess Mar√≠a de los Dolores, died in Madrid in 1996. On 12 December 2000 in London he married Josette Calil. In December 2016 he sold the Czartoryski collection to the Polish state at an extremely low price in a transaction that drew some criticism and resulted in legal battles. Czartoryski collection sale The Czartoryski collection was started in 1796 by Adam Karol Czartoryski's ancestor, Princess Izabela Czartoryska, a liberal progressive who corresponded with Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Benjamin Franklin. The original goal was to preserve Poland's cultural heritage, but later objects from around the world were added, including items looted from the camp of the Ottoman Sultan after the 1683 Battle of Vienna. Izabela's descendants added works from Greece, Rome, Egypt and Japan. In 1798 Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, Izabela's son, visited Italy where he bought Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine and Raphael's Portrait of a young man. Rembrandt's Landscape with the Good Samaritan is the third of the \\"big three\\" works in the collection. By 1939 the collection had 5,000 paintings, statues and other antiquities. When the Germans invaded Poland that year, Augustyn J√≥zef Czartoryski had the most valuable items hidden beneath the baroque Sieniawski family castle, while others were stored in the cellar of the museum. However the Germans found the collection and the works were taken to various locations in Germany. After the war the Polish representative at the Allies Commission for the Retrieval of Works of Art found many of the stolen paintings and claimed them for the Czartoryski Museum. The Portrait of a Young Man was not recovered. The museum became a branch of the National Museum of Poland in Krak√≥w. The collection now included 86,000 artworks and 250,000 books and other manuscripts. In London in the late 1960s Adam Karol Czartoryski met Professor Marek Rostworowski, who had been appointed in 1965 as director of the Czartoryski Collection in Poland. In 1991 Professor Rostworowski was appointed Minister of Culture. That year the High Court restored the Czartoryski Museum and Library and their contents to Czartoryski, who set up the Princes Czartoryski Foundation to manage the collection. The National Museum continued to maintain and administer the collection, renting the buildings from the foundation. Princes Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w The Princes Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w was closed for extensive renovations in 2010, including adding a glass and steel roof to a courtyard that was not being used. The foundation obtained funding for the works from Norway Grants, local and national government authorities and loans to foreign exhibitions of the Lady with an Ermine, but by the end of 2016 had run out of money, while the project would cost about ‚Ç¨6.9 million to complete. Czartoryski decided to entrust his collection to the Polish Nation, including the Lady With An Ermine, Landscape with the Good Samaritan and works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The agreement to sell the collection to the Polish state for ‚Ç¨100 million was signed on 29 December 2016. The deputy prime minister and minister of culture, Piotr Gli≈Ñski, signed on behalf of the Republic of Poland. The purchase price was far below the estimated value of $2 billion. Despite this, the state's purchase was criticized on the grounds that the money could have been better spent to preserve threatened Polish heritage sites, such as derelict manor houses. By law, the Czartoryski Collection could anyway not leave the country without authorization by the government. The artworks would not be moved. Most of them were in the National Museum in Krak√≥w, apart from Da Vinci's Lady With an Ermine, which was in the Wawel Royal Castle in Krak√≥w. It was expected that the museum would be ready to reopen by 2019. The management board of the Czartoryski Foundation complained that they had not been consulted over the sale, and resigned. They said it might be illegal, since the statute establishing the foundation said the collection was nontransferable and indivisible. One of the board members expressed concern that the collection might eventually by broken up and sold to private owners. The endowment was challenged by Czartoryski's daughter, Tamara, and in 2018 resulted in a lawsuit between Adam Karol and his daughter.

These experiments were motivated by the interest in determining the quark structure of the nucleon following the discovery of high levels of deep inelastic scattering at SLAC. In 1972 two muon beams were proposed for the then new Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) machine. One by Roger Clifft and Erwin Gabathuler and one by Friedhelm Brasse and Joerg Gayler. The two teams came together to design a high intensity muon beam of energy up to 280 GeV to do the experiments. The collaboration which became known as the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) was formed around these people to carry out the experiments. A proposal for the beam and an apparatus to do the experiments was submitted to CERN in 1974 (the White Book). The experiments were approved and the apparatus was built between the years 1974‚Äì78. The collaboration grew in size to about 100 physicists. This was among the largest experimental collaborations at the time. Several experiments were performed. Each experiment is denoted by a number NAxx where NA is for North Area experiments approved by CERN and xx is the number given to it by CERN. EMC experiments =NA2 : Electromagnetic interactions of muons= Preparing for NA2. NA2 was a single magnet spectrometer to measure the forward production products of deep inelastic scattering by muons. Data were taken for this experiment in the years between 1978‚Äì1981. =NA9 : Study of final states in deep inelastic muon scattering= For this experiment a second magnet containing a streamer chamber was added upstream of the NA2 apparatus to detect and measure the products of the deep inelastic scattering reactions at wider angles. Further groups joined the EMC for these experiments and the collaboration grew to about 150 physicists. The experiments were performed between 1981‚Äì1983. =NA28 : Study of shadowing and hadron production in high energy ¬µ scattering using nuclear targets= During the NA9 phase, a state of the art (at the time) processor was installed by the University of Uppsala group to trigger on scattered muons at very small angles to the beam (this was the NA28 experiment). This experiment was designed to investigate shadowing in nuclei. From 1984‚Äì1985 the experiment reverted to the single magnet spectrometer of NA2 and a large polarized target together with subsidiary nuclear targets were installed.  Major results of the experiments The first results of the NA2 phase of the experiment showed that charm production was mediated by the photon-gluon fusion process. The collaboration then went on to show that the scattering rate in iron and deuterium were different. This showed that the quark sub-structure of nucleons bound in nuclei is different from that of free nucleons. The effect became known as the EMC effect and aroused great interest among theoretical physicists. It was planned to replace the iron, deuterium and hydrogen targets with a polarized target in 1981. However, it proved to be difficult to build the large volume target necessary and this experiment was postponed until 1984. In addition the Lund model of quark fragmentation (which later became known as PYTHIA) became available and much of the data on forward produced hadrons were used to tune this model. The NA9/NA28 phases of the experiment commenced taking data in 1981. The main results of these experiments were the confirmation of our understanding of the quark fragmentation process. Again the results were used to develop models of this process such as PYTHIA and the HERWIG model which had become available. The NA28 experiment discovered that the results of scattering in nuclei at small values of Bjorken x were much different from those at larger values. The process governing this behavior became known as shadowing in nuclei. The final phase of the experiment with the polarized target produced the most dramatic result from the experiment with the discovery only a small part of the proton spin is carried by quarks, and that the strange quark sea is probably polarized.

Early life Kenyon was educated in Tameside at West Hill School and King's School, Macclesfield. Career Kenyon was a director and chief executive of sportswear firm Umbro. =Manchester United= In 1997, Kenyon took up the role of deputy chief executive at the club he supported as a boy, Manchester United, where he sat on the Board of Directors. He was promoted to chief executive in August 2000 following the departure of Martin Edwards. Kenyon was influential in persuading long-serving manager Alex Ferguson to remain at the club despite Ferguson's original intention to retire in 2002. One of the other notable aspects of Kenyon's time in charge was the fact that the club dismissed their rigid wage structure and spent large sums of money on players such as Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n and Rio Ferdinand. =Chelsea= In 2003, Kenyon moved to Chelsea, which was seen as controversial as he had previously proclaimed himself as a lifelong Manchester United supporter. At Chelsea, Kenyon was involved in high-profile incidents, including an attempt to persuade the manager of the England national team Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson to become manager of Chelsea, and the tapping-up of former Arsenal and England left-back Ashley Cole. On 16 September 2009, Chelsea announced that Kenyon would be leaving his chief executive role at Chelsea at the end of October. =Third-party ownership= On 22 September 2014, an investigation by The Guardian implicated Kenyon and Portuguese superagent Jorge Mendes in breaching FIFA regulations regarding third-party ownership and conflict of interest in player representation, buying player rights through companies based in Jersey and Ireland. The Guardian also published a detailed report showing Kenyon's ex-club Chelsea have invested in third party ownership via Mendes and Kenyon, a practice banned by the Premier League. Chelsea declined to comment on the accusations. Kenyon at the time of writing is also a non-executive director at Championship club Middlesbrough. Kenyon‚Äôs contacts enabled 'Boro to sign former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel on a short term deal until the end of the 2017/18 season, to which Mikel scored his only goal in a 1-2 win for Middlesbrough v Rotherham.

The single release includes \\"5/4\\", a song that is instrumental except for a Speak & Spell dialogue sample that was played as the intro for live shows since 2000, but wasn't released until 2002. Overview The song was confirmed by frontman Till Lindemann and guitarist Richard Kruspe to be a reference to their unhappy childhood relationships with their own mothers. The lyrics tell the story of a child not born from a womb but in an experiment, thus having no true father or mother. The lyrics describe his plan to kill both the mother \\"who never gave birth to him\\" and then himself. However, he fails to kill himself, instead ending up mutilated and no better off than before. The child begs and prays for strength, but his dead mother does not answer. The narrative of the song is similar to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, in that the character takes revenge for his misfortunes on his \\"parent\\" but ends up no different than before the \\"parent\\" died. Music video The video for Mutter follows the story of the song, in which Lindemann portrays a monstrous character who kills his mother and then dumps her body in a river before ending up locked in an underground cage. Lindemann has a bald head and is clad in rags for this role, but also portrays a well-dressed character with long hair who is seen rowing a boat in a swamp. Live performances The song debuted in its demo form during an April 2000 concert exclusively for members of the official fan club. The only difference between the demo version and the final release was that the demo version was less orchestrated. During the Mutter tour, it was played at every concert and played in select concerts in the Pledge of Allegiances tour in North America. The song then disappeared from Rammstein concerts until 2011, and has been a staple of their live shows since.

Design This layout was adopted by Ben Lexcen, designer of Australia II. Although Ben Lexcen \\"had tried the winged keel idea before\\"Bruce Stannard, Ben lexcen, the man, the keel and the cup, Faber and Faber, 1984, , there is ample evidence that it was computed and designed by a Dutch aerodynamicist at the Wageningen towing tank (Netherlands Ship Model Bassin). =Wings= The lateral wings of Australia II are of moderate aspect ratio, forming a nearly horizontal foil, the \\"wing\\", at the bottom to provide additional effective span, in the same way as the winglets on an aircraft. Each wing acts as a winglet, effectively increasing the keel aspect ratio therefore reducing the lift-induced drag. Because the yacht is heeled over when sailing upwind, the leeward foil attains more draft, which reduces the loss of efficiency that always occurs under heel. The wings were canted downwards at about 20 degrees, in order to promote proper hydrodynamic loading (lift) on each wing when sailing to windward. Upwind, it offered 30% less resistance due to side force. =Upside down keel= Note that, contrary to classic configurations, the keel of this boat is \\"upside down\\" under the hull (the root chord is smaller than the tip (bottom) chord) in order to minimize the hull-keel interaction and the loss of side force due to the proximity of the water surface. The extra low- positioned lead in the upside down keel and wings gives a very low centre of gravity, increasing the righting moment (lateral stability) and allowing to carry more sail area. =Shorter boat, more sail area= Under the 12 metre class rule, the allowed sail area is an inverse function of the boat length and weight. Her stability advantage allowed Australia II to carry more sail although the boat was lighter. Along with Australia IIs efficient sail design, this winged keel was one of the factors contributing to Australia IIs success. Total advantage offered by this concept on the race course was about 1 minute per upwind leg. Application Winged keels are generally found on high- performance sailboats if they are not prohibited by class rules. They are especially advantageous for heavy yachts with a lot of sail area (as 12-metre class boats), sailing upwind when the draft is limited by the class rule or by the requirement to be able to sail in shallow water, because in that case high righting moment and efficient side force are difficult to obtain. Downwind, the extra skin friction drag is a hindrance. Besides the performance benefits, winged keels can also be applied to pleasure boats as a way to reduce draft, allowing for greater versatility when cruising in shallow waters.

In theatres and live music venues, it consists of the auditorium and foyers, as opposed to the stage and backstage areas. In a theatre, the front of house manager is responsible for ticket sales, refreshments, and making sure the auditorium is set out properly.  Live venues  Sound operators, excluding the monitor engineers, are normally positioned in a small sectioned-off area front-of-house, surrounded by the audience or at the edge of the audience area. From this position they have unobstructed listening and a clear view of the performance, enabling the operation of the main speaker system, show control consoles and other equipment. In this case \\"front of house\\" can refer to both the general audience/public area or to the specific small section from where the show is mixed. The front of house speakers are the main speakers that cover the audience, and the front of house desk is the desk that generates the front of house audio mix. In smaller venues the front of house desk may also produce foldback (monitor) mixes for the monitor speakers onstage, whereas in larger venues there will normally be a second mixing desk for monitor control positioned just off the side of the main stage. The audio engineer that designs the front of house sound system and puts it into place for the show/event is the system engineer, and this role is often separate from the person who operates the mixing desk who is often employed by the band directly on larger tours or employed by the venue for smaller tours. The touring engineer is usually assisted by a house sound engineer (employed by the venue) who will be familiar with the installed system of the venue. In stage lighting, any lighting fixtures that are on the audience side of the proscenium arch are referred to as being FOH. The lighting operator may also be located in the audience area as well, but are often in a lighting booth.

Life He graduated from University of Chicago, with a PhD. In 2000, Allman's laboratory reported identification of a class of neurons - large spindle-shaped cells - unique to humans and our closest relatives, the great apes. The spindle neurons, now called the Von Economo neurons to distinguish them from other spindle-shaped cells, were first located in layer V of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and later found in the frontoinsular cortex. Allman's team has reported reduced ACC size and metabolic activity in autistic patients, and activity of the ACC is also reduced in patients diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and depression, whereas ACC activity is increased in patients with obsessive- compulsive, phobic, post-traumatic stress, and anxiety disorders. The ACC is largely responsible for relaying waves of neural signals from deep within the brain to far flung regions, including Brodmann area 10. Spindle neurons may develop abnormally in people with autistic disorders, and abnormalities may also be linked to schizophrenia and frontotemporal lobe degeneration, but research into these correlations is at a very early stage. Allman studies brain evolution in mammals from multiple perspectives, and has created a number of 3d reconstructions of mammalian brains. Grants * 2009 James S.

This one has no tunic but is finely pleated, in the Fortuny manner, and falls in long lines, closely following the figure, to the floor.\\" The Delphos gown is a finely pleated silk dress first created in about 1907 by French designer Henriette Negrin and her husband, Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo (1871‚Äì1949). They produced the gowns until about 1950.Henriette Fortuny: ritratto di una musa, La Donna dietro l'Artista It was inspired by, and named after, a classical Greek statue, the Charioteer of Delphi. Since the 1970s, these gowns have been desirable and collectable pieces of vintage clothing, with one selling for a world record price of $10,000 in December 2001. History PFF collection Working out of a 13th-century Venetian palazzo, Fortuny, a Spanish-born artist turned textile designer, produced garments that the novelist Marcel Proust declared \\"faithfully antique but markedly original\\". The \\"Delphos\\" was a deliberate reference to the chiton of ancient Greece and meant to be worn without undergarments, since the chiton was itself a form of underwear, a radical suggestion during the early years of the 20th century. Fortuny became famous for his pleated dresses, the \\"Delphos\\" and the related \\"Peplos\\". The exact method of pleating was a closely guarded secret involving heat, pressure and ceramic rods, which has never been replicated.\\"Mariano Fortuny: Dress (2001.702a)\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2001.702a (October 2006) On both types of dresses, glass Murano beads are strung on a silk cord along each side seam. The beads serve a functional purpose as well as being decorative, as they weigh down the lightweight silk of the garment to ensure a smooth fit enhancing the natural, uncorseted human form beneath. The construction of the Delphos became its own decoration. Although the \\"Delphos\\" eventually became formal wear, with Lauren Bacall wearing a vintage red Delphos to the 1978 Oscars, it was originally intended as informal clothing or a tea gown for wearing solely in the privacy of the home.Clare Suaro, \\"From the Collection: Dress by Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo\\" Delphos gowns were imported into Paris by the couturier Paul Poiret, and the fashion house Babani which sold them to actresses such as Eleonora Duse. Elena vestida con t√∫nica amarilla by Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1909. Elena Sorolla Garcia in a yellow Delphos.  The Delphos as art  Fortuny's garments, particularly the Delphos gown, have been valued for their artistic and aesthetic qualities since their creation. The fashion historian and writer Colin McDowell considers Fortuny one of the creators of fashion as art, and a Delphos gown was one of only two garments contained in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 2003. During the 1910s and 1920s the Spanish painter Joaqu√≠n Sorolla painted several portraits of his wife and other sitters wearing Delphos gowns, some of which are preserved at the Museo Sorolla. The sculptor Hamo Thornycroft described his daughter Elfrida as looking lovely in a 'silk Greek clinging white dress', a Delphos which Elfrida later donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum. In literature, Marcel Proust described Fortuny's clothes several times in his epic novel In Search of Lost Time, comparing them to musical harmonies, although not explicitly calling them art.

He achieved national recognition for his studies of individual nineteenth-century American authors. After teaching at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, for 38 years, he was forced into retirement in 1960 after pleading guilty to charges stemming from the possession of pictures of semi-nude males that the law deemed pornographic.In 2006, The New York Times described the objectionable materials as \\"'beefcake' magazines and pictures of men ‚Äî illegal pornography then, but much of it like today's Calvin Klein underwear ads.\\" ‚Ä¢ McFadden, New York Times, February 20, 2006. Arvin was also one of the first lovers of the author Truman Capote. Life and career Frederick Newton Arvin was born in Valparaiso, Indiana, and never used his given first name. He studied English literature at Harvard, graduating summa cum laude in 1921. His writing career began when Van Wyck Brooks, the Harvard teacher he most admired, invited him to write for The Freeman while he was still an undergraduate. After a short period teaching at the high school level, Arvin joined the English faculty at Smith College and, though he never earned a doctorate, won a tenured position. One of his students was Sylvia Plath, the poet and novelist. He taught at Smith College for 38 years and was Mary Augusta Jordan Professor of English during the year before his retirement in 1961. He rarely left Northampton for long nor travelled far. He visited Europe only once, in the summer of 1929 or 1930. He spent a year's leave of absence in the mid-1920s as the editor of Living Age, a weekly compendium of articles from British and American periodicals.Daniel Aaron and Sylvan Schendler, eds., American Pantheon: Essays (NY: Delacorte Press 1966), xxii, 251 Arvin often wrote about political issues and took public political positions. For example, in 1936, on the day when Harvard celebrated its 300th anniversary, he joined a group of 28 Harvard graduates in an attack on retired Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell for his role years earlier on an advisory Committee to Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller that found that Sacco and Vanzetti had received a fair trial.

The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 (AWCA), California legislation that banned the manufacture, sale, transportation, or importation of specified semi-automatic firearms. The plaintiffs alleged that various provisions of the AWCA infringed upon their individual constitutionally- guaranteed right to keep and bear arms. Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt wrote the opinion of the three-member panel. The court engaged in an extensive analysis of the history of the Second Amendment and its attendant case law. The court concluded that the Second Amendment did not guarantee individuals the right to keep and bear arms. Instead, the court concluded that the Second Amendment provides \\"collective\\" rights, which is limited to the arming of state militia. The Ninth Circuit refused to hear the case en banc but issued a set of dissenting opinions to the denial to take the case en banc, which included a notable opinion by Judge Alex Kozinski. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review.124 S. Ct. 803 (2003) The decision conflicted with the holding of the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Emerson.

The hat is most commonly worn as part of a uniform, by such organizations as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the New Zealand Army, United States Park Rangers, and Scouts. The campaign hat is occasionally referred to as a Stetson, derived from its origin in the company's Boss of the Plains model in the late 19th century. It should not be confused with the Stetson style cowboy hat, which has a different brim and crease, nor a slouch hat. History Frederick Russell Burnham wearing a campaign hat The origins of the hat can be traced to the 1840s when U.S. Army mounted troops posted to the far-west sometimes wore wide-brimmed civilian hats, which were more practical than the regulation shakos and forage caps then issued. The crease was influenced by the designs of the sombreros worn by the Mexican Vaqueros. The name started to be used after the 1872‚Äì1876 regulations, which introduced a black felt hat‚Äîwhich could be drab after 1883‚Äîfor fatigue use derived from the types popularized during the American Civil War. Some were worn with campaign cords, mainly as a form of decoration. At least as early as 1893, hats of the Stetson Boss of the Plains type were being creased into pointed tops by British South Africa Company (BSAC) scouts in Africa. When designing the iconic uniform for Boy Scouts, Baden-Powell drew on the hat worn by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated American scout, during his service as Chief of Scouts in the BSAC and the British Army in the 1890s. The 1,200 Canadian troops serving under Baden-Powell were the first to wear the campaign hat as a part of their official uniform, and this very likely influenced Baden-Powell's decision to order 10,000 of the hats for the British troops. A version of the hat, with a crease along the top of the crown, was worn by some US Army troops during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The army officially adopted the \\"Montana peaked\\" design as a service hatParagraph 76 \\"Regulations and Notes for the Uniform of the Army of the United States\\" Washington Government Printing Office 1912 on 8 September 1911. Through the World War I era, the campaign hat worn by American soldiers was fairly soft. Those worn by the United States Army's general officers had a golden cord around it, whereas other commissioned officers had a golden-and-black campaign cord around their hat. Field clerks, as well as their post-war successors the warrant officers, had a silver-and-black cord, while other ranks had cords in their branch-of-service colors. The United States Marine Corps had the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor badge in black at the front of their campaign hats; its officers had an additional golden-and- scarlet cord around their hat, whereas its other ranks had none.National Geographic Magazine, October 1917 By the 1930s the felt was made very stiff with a permanently flat brim. Due to the frequent wearing of helmets in France in World War I, most troops received a copy of the French that became known as the overseas cap. In 1942 the campaign hat ceased to be issued generally, but it was still commonly found in the Pacific theatre for much of the war, and was the trademark of General Joseph Stilwell. Current usage =Royal Canadian Mounted Police= RCMP constable in Red Serge In Canada the campaign hat was the official dress hat of the North-West Mounted Police (later Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who retain it as part of the full dress uniform) as well as Canadian cavalry units in the Boer War and First World War. In the Boer War (South Africa 1899 to 1902) all Canadian military units with the exception of the Royal Canadian Regiment wore campaign hats. The campaign hat was also the hat of the Canadian Scouts and the South African Constabulary, which was led by a Canadian Colonel Sam Steele (formerly North-West Mounted Police), both of these units having many Canadians enlisted. The hat was phased out of military use by the service dress cap following the First World War. It was also used by members of the Ontario Provincial Police, but it was phased out in 2009 due to problems wearing them in police cruisers.https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2009/01/10/opp_doffs_stetsons_in_favour_of_caps.html Though similar to the U.S. campaign hat, the indentations of the Canadian style hat are somewhat deeper and appear above the face of the wearer whilst the American hats have the indentations to the side so a regimental badge can be worn in the middle of the hat. =New Zealand Army= alt=Two Maori officers wearing military uniforms smile at the camera, surrounded by other soldiers in front of a building The New Zealand Army, whose uniforms have historically followed the British pattern, retain the felt campaign hat as their most visible national distinction. This headdress is distinguished by a high crown and deep indentations on all four sides. It was adopted by the Wellington Regiment about 1912 (as proposed by William Malone) and became general issue for all New Zealand units during the latter stages of World War I. In addition to badge insignia, the different branches of service were differentiated by coloured puggarees or wide bands around the base of the crown (blue and red for artillery, khaki and green for mounted rifles, khaki and red for infantry, blue for engineers, yellow for Pay Corps, khaki and white for Army Service Corps, cherry-red for the Medical Corps and maroon for the Veterinary Corps.).Wayne Stack, page 35 \\"The New Zealand Expeditionary Force in World War I, The hat was worn to a certain extent during World War II, although often replaced by more convenient forage caps or berets. After being in abeyance since 1960, the hat was reintroduced in 1977Malcolm Thomas and Cliff Lord, page 129 - Part One \\"New Zealand Army Distinguishing Patches 1911-1991, for ceremonial dress, where it was usually worn with a version of the khaki \\"no 2\\" service dress of the British Army.

In 2012 it was announced that this form of campaign hat was to be replaced for general wear by the \\"Mounted Rifles Hat\\";Fairfax NZ News 3 May 2012 a headdress resembling that of the Australian Army but without the turned-up side rim. The historic \\"Lemon Squeezer\\" has however been retained for use by honour guards and other limited categories on special formal occasions.http://www.army.mil.nz/about-us/who-we- are/structure/uniforms/ceremonial-service-dress.htm =United States= Armed Forces US Marine Corps drill instructor provides verbal instruction to a recruit while wearing a campaign hat The hat worn by male United States Army drill sergeants is olive drab in color with a golden Great Seal of the United States on a disc centered on the front (infantry drill sergeants have a blue disc behind the seal); this is the same insignia as traditionally worn on the Service Cap and the Dress Cap. Female drill sergeants in the Army do not wear a campaign hat but instead wear a hat resembling an Australian bush hat. Originally beige in color, in 1983 the color was changed to green with the style remaining unchanged. The 133rd Field Artillery Regiment of the Texas Army National Guard wears the Fort Sill style Artillery Campaign Hat during formal functions, such as the annual Saint Barbara's Day Ball. Male and female United States Marine Corps drill instructors and Primary Marksmanship Instructors wear similar campaign hats with a matte black Eagle, Globe, and Anchor centered on the front; the same insignia is worn on their olive drab combination hats. While US Marine Corps officers wear a scarlet and gold cord around the hats and generals wear a solid gold cord, enlisted Marines no longer wear cords around the hats. The US Marine Corps campaign hats were introduced on 20 July 1956. Male United States Air Force military training instructors (MTIs) wear navy blue hats with the Great Seal of the United States within a ring, in silver color, again centered on the front; this is the same insignia as worn on their service cap. Female MTIs wear an Aussie Style hat. Air Force MTIs in the top ten percent of their career field wear a light blue cord and are more likely to be referred to as \\"Blue Ropes\\" than MTIs. US Coast Guard recruit training company commanders (USCG-USN counterpart to drill instructors) wear a navy blue version with a black cord; the insignia worn is the same as worn with the combination cover. The United States Navy is the only US armed force not to use the campaign hat. Their recruit division commanders wear normal prescribed hats for their uniforms, with a red aiguillette on their shoulder to show their status. Park rangers Smokey Bear wears a forest ranger style campaign hat Campaign hats are worn by US park rangers of the National Park Service. The federal troops sent to protect the resources of the first national parks were cavalry troopers, whose campaign hat was adopted by the Park Service as a symbol of authority. The evolution of the campaign hat can be seen in a 1905 photo of Buffalo Soldiers in Yosemite. Although the hat would not become Army standard until six years later, some in the photo have re-creased their hats into the Montana Peak, probably during their service in Cuba or the Philippines during the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Following the national park ranger style, many states' fish and game wardens and state park police wear campaign hats. Rangers of many local parks departments also wear the campaign hat, such as the New York City Urban Park Rangers. The animal logo-mascot of the US Forest Service, Smokey Bear, wears the campaign hat. Smokey's debut poster was released on August 9, 1944, which is considered his birthday. Overseen by the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign, the first poster was illustrated by Albert Staehle. In it, Smokey was depicted wearing jeans and a \\"forest ranger's hat\\" (a campaign hat), pouring a bucket of water on a campfire. The message underneath reads, \\"Smokey says ‚Äì Care _will_ prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires!\\" The emblem of the National Park Foundation was, until December 2013, a stylized campaign hat. Law enforcement Several US state police services and federal agencies wear campaign hats. So common is use of the campaign hat among state highway police that they are sometimes referred to as \\"smokey bears\\" or \\"smokeys,\\" after Smokey Bear, the US Forest Service mascot. Campaign hats are also worn by the US Border Patrol. Many other police agencies, including numerous county sheriffs' services, and tribal police departments use campaign hats. Some local police use it for particular duties or divisions; for example, officers of the Chicago Police Department's mounted unit employ the hat, as do deputy sheriffs assigned as cadre of the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp. =Scouts= Scout with a campaign hat, 1918 The campaign hat was worn by and associated with Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouting movement, and is still available for wear by Scouts of the Boy Scouts of America and Scout organizations in several countries. Because this style of hat is also so traditionally associated with Scouting, campaign hats are often used as presentation items by troops and local councils for adult Scouters and community and business leaders being honored for their service to the Scouting movement. Baden-Powell was British, but picked up the habit of wearing a Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief for the first time in 1896 in Africa during the Second Matabele War. It was during this time that Baden-Powell, already a cavalryman, was befriended by the celebrated American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who favored the campaign hat. In the African hills it was Burnham who first introduced Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, and taught him woodcraft (better known today as Scoutcraft). After Baden-Powell became famous as the victor of the Siege of Mafeking in 1899, his hat became something of a trademark. In 1900, Baden-Powell was appointed to raise and command the South African Constabulary and he included the campaign hat as part of their uniform. He may have been influenced by the fact that the trade name of the hats, Boss of the Plains, was sometimes abbreviated to B-P, Baden-Powell's own initials.Jeal (1989), (Chapter 7, part 2), When Baden-Powell re-wrote his Army handbook Aids to Scouting into Scouting For Boys in 1908, he included sketches of Boy Scouts wearing the campaign hat. He prescribed a campaign hat as part of the Scout uniform, which he stated was \\"very like the uniform worn by my men when I commanded the South African Constabulary\\". He continued; \\"...The broad brimmed khaki hat is a good protection from sun and rain.\\" Scouting for Boys and the Scout Movement itself quickly spread through the British Empire and then to other countries, such as the United States and Russia where in both cases, Scouting started in 1909.Eduard Vallory World Scouting: Educating for Global Citizenship, Palgrave Macmillan, (p. 16) Baden-Powell's uniform was widely imitated by Scout associations in many countries, but eventually began to be discarded in favor of cheaper and more practical headgear; the British Scout Association introduced the uniform beret as an alternative to the hat after World War II and finally abolished its use altogether in 1967. The campaign hat remains an option for members of the Boy Scouts of America. (p. 8) In \\"traditional Scouting\\" organizations such as the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association in the United Kingdom, BP Service Association in Canada and the Baden-Powell Service Association in the United States, campaign hats are worn by both male and female Scouts and leaders.

Sources vary on what proportion of party members must adhere to the party line in order for the vote to constitute a \\"party-line\\" vote. For example, the Congressional Record has stated: \\"A party-line vote is one on which a majority of Republicans vote one way and a majority of Democrats vote another. 2.

Party-line votes are also noted to reflect the degree to which the division of power requires parties to retain cohesion in order to implement its goals: The United States In the United States Congress it is the function of the party whip of each party in each house to ensure that members adhere to party policies and in particular that members vote for or against bills, amendments, and (in the case of the United States Senate) for or against treaties and Administration appointments as determined by senior party leadership. The leverage available to the party whip may be in rewards (such as the negotiation of side deals for pork barrel spending), or in punishments (such as withholding appointments to powerful committees). The ultimate threat is to support another candidate in the primary election with endorsements and party funds. The party whip will operate under the direction of the particular party's leader (called respectively the majority leader or the minority leader).

Once a very popular model with law enforcement and military units in the United States, the DA/SA 5906 has been superseded by polymer-framed striker-fired models from Glock, Heckler & Koch, SIG Sauer as well as Smith & Wesson's own M&P; line of polymer framed handguns in both 9mm and .40 calibers. Variants The first generation Smith & Wesson semi-auto pistol designations consist of two digits, such as Smith & Wesson Model 39 and Model 59. Second generation pistols are designated by three digits; these include the Model 459, Model 659, etc. Many second generation designs were eventually upgraded with various improvements, thus becoming the third generation pistols; these are identified by the addition of a fourth digit to the second generation model number: 5903, 5904, 5905, 5906, etc. However, there are exceptions to this numbering scheme, namely the third generation Value Series pistols such as the S&W; Models 915 and 910, and the Model 457. 5900 series manufacturing history 5906TSW The Model 5903 was manufactured from 1990 to 1997, and featured an aluminum alloy frame and a stainless steel slide with a 15-round double-stack magazine. Produced from 1989 to 1998, the Model 5904 has an aluminum alloy frame and blued carbon steel slide, also with a 15-round magazine, and inspired two other derivative pistols, the Smith & Wesson Models 915 and 910. The Model 5905 featured a carbon steel (blued) slide and frame, and was produced in 1991 only in very limited numbers. The Model 5906, produced from 1989-1999, is an all-stainless steel model, and is therefore significantly heavier than the other models in the 59XX series.Cite Cheaper Than Dirt Website The stainless steel double-action only variant of this pistol, the Model 5946, along with the Model 3953, produced from 1990 to 1999, was manufactured without safety levers, and is the primary issue service pistol of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Department of Fisheries and Oceans as well as one of three pistols available for selection by New York City Police Department. The Model 5967 is a Lew Horton limited edition S&W; model. Only 500 of these were made as a special offering in 1990. The pistol is a 3914 carbon steel slide on a 5906 stainless steel frame, two-tone tan polymer finish with brown Hogue grips. The sights are Novak Lo-Mount fixed three-dot sights. Product code is 103048, which is a 4-inch barrel and first (square) trigger guard.

Grove Art Online, 2003. Michals's work makes innovative use of photo-sequences, often incorporating text to examine emotion and philosophy.  Education and career  Michals's interest in art \\"began at age 14 while attending watercolor university classes at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.\\" In 1953, he received a B.A. from the University of Denver. In 1956, after two years in the Army, he went on to study at the Parsons School of Design with a plan to become a graphic designer; however, he did not complete his studies. He describes his photographic skills as \\"completely self-taught.\\" In 1958, while on a holiday in the USSR he discovered an interest in photography. The photographs he made during this trip became his first exhibition held in 1963 at the Underground Gallery in New York City. For a number of years, Michals was a commercial photographer, working for Esquire and Mademoiselle, and he covered the filming of The Great Gatsby for Vogue (1974). He did not have a studio. Instead, he took portraits of people in their environment, which was a contrast to the method of other photographers at the time, such as Avedon and Irving Penn. Michals was hired by the government of Mexico to photograph the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1970, his works were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The portraits he took between 1958 and 1988 would later become the basis of his book, Album. In 1976, Michals received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Michals also produced the art for the album Synchronicity (by The Police) in 1983, and Clouds Over Eden by Richard Barone in 1993.  Artistic influences and impact  Though he has not been involved in gay civil rights, his photography has addressed gay themes. In discussing his notion of the artist's relationship to politics and power however, Michals feels ultimately that aspirations are useless: > I feel the political aspirations are impotent. They can never be seen. If > they are, it will only be by a limited audience. If one is to act > politically, one simply puts down the camera and goes out and does > something. I think of someone like Heartfield who ridiculed the Nazis. Who > very creatively took great stands. He could have been killed at any moment, > he was Jewish, and my God what the guy did. It was extraordinary. You don't > see that now.Seidner, David.\\"Duane Michaels Interview\\" BOMB Magazine Summer, > 1987. Retrieved May 17, 2013. Michals cites Balthus, William Blake, Lewis Carroll, Thomas Eakins, Ren√© Magritte, and Walt Whitman as influences on his art. In turn, he has influenced photographers such as David Levinthal and Francesca Woodman. He is noted for two innovations in artistic photography developed in the 1960s and 1970s. First, he \\"[told] a story through a series of photos\\" as in his 1970 book Sequences. Second, he handwrote text near his photographs, thereby giving information that the image itself could not convey.

It is also known as a garrison cap or flight cap in the United States, wedge cap in Canada, or field service cap in the United Kingdom. In form the side cap is comparable to the glengarry, a folding version of the Scottish military bonnet. It has been associated with various military forces since the middle of the 19th century, as well as various civilian organizations. Australia All ranks of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) are entitled to wear the blue garrison cap with appropriate cap badge as an optional items with General Purpose Uniform (GPU), Service Dress (SD) and Flying Dress (FD) uniforms. The piping of the garrison cap for air officers is light blue, the piping for all other ranks is solid blue. The RAAF is the only branch of the Australian Defence Force entitled to wear garrison caps. Canada =Army= In the Canadian Armed Forces, the field service cap () is defined by the Canadian Forces Dress Instructions as a \\"cloth folding or 'wedge cap'...Originally designed for wear during field operations and training, it may now also be worn as an undress cap with full and undress uniforms.\\"Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 1, ¬∂ 22 The cap is worn as part of the undress uniform by students of Royal Military College of Canada,Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 5, Annex B, ¬∂ 2 and as an optional item by all ranks of rifle regiments with ceremonial dress, mess dress, and service dress uniforms.Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 6, sect. 1, ¬∂ 4c The field service cap was originally adopted army-wide in 1939, and replaced in 1943 by a khaki beret. The coloured field service cap was a variant permitted for private purchase and worn only when off duty. These were in the colours of the regiment or corps of the wearer. =Air Force= For personnel who wear air force uniform, the blue wedge cap () is authorized for wear with all orders of dress, save for the combat uniform.Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 6, sect. 1, ¬∂ 5 It is properly worn \\"on the right side of the head, centred front and back, with the front edge of the cap above the right eyebrow.\\"Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 2, sect. 2, ¬∂ 15d Cap badges are worn on the left side, with the centre of the badge from the front of the cap centred between the flap and the top seam.Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, Annex D, Appendix 1 The cap worn by general officers is embellished with silver piping.Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 3, sect. 2, ¬∂ 9 Air force military police in dress uniform wear a scarlet flash in the front of their wedge caps showing . Air force members of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command wear a tan flash in the front of their wedge caps.Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, chap. 6, sect. 1, ¬∂ 5c Prior to Unification in 1968, the Royal Canadian Air Force wore uniforms similar to those worn by the Royal Air Force, including a blue wedge cap. After 1968, the uniforms of the three services were replaced by a universal rifle-green uniform; the air force, however, was permitted to retain the wedge cap, although in rifle green instead of blue. With the advent of the Distinct Environmental Uniform, the blue wedge cap returned. The wedge cap is also the official headdress of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association and the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. Italy In the Italian language, the side cap is called . It was adopted by the Royal Italian Army in the 1920s, and by the 1930s it was the main cap used by personnel belonging to the Royal Italian Army, the Regia Aeronautica (air force) and the Blackshirts. It remained in use until well after World War II. France CRS in normal gear, standing by a Bastille Day parade Spahi uniform today: 2006 pattern parade uniform for a mar√©chal des logis of the 1st Spahi Regiment, with red bonnet de police and distinctive burnous. The French bonnet de police (or \\"calot\\") had originated as a long, pointed headdress, with a tassel at the end of the trailing crown (or 'flamme'). Gradually the flamme grew shorter until by the mid-nineteenth century the bonnet de police had become a true folding cap with no trailing crown. Instead the tassel dangled from a short cord sewn onto front point of the crown, hanging above the soldier's right eye. This style of headdress with a hanging tassel was widely worn by both the Belgian ArmyLiliane et Fred Funcken, page 107 \\"L'Uniforme et les Armes des Soldate de las Guerre 1939-1945\\" vol. 1, Casterman 1972 and the Spanish Army during the first half of the 20th Century. It is still used by the Spanish Foreign Legion. When reintroduced for undress or fatigue wear in 1891 the French army's bonnet de police had become a plain item of dress without decoration. The colour of this working cap matched that of the tunic with which it was worn (either dark blue, light blue or black prior to World War I; horizon blue from 1915 to 1930; and thereafter khaki).Francois Vauvillier, page 21, \\"Uniformes 1940 L'Infanterie\\", Argout-Editions Paris 1980 In 1915 the \\"bonnet de police\\" generally replaced the kepi for other ranks during the remainder of the First World War, because of its greater convenience when the \\"Adrian\\" steel helmet was issued. Between 1944 and 1962 however this headdress was worn by most branches of the French Army in a wide variety of colours, which normally matched those of the kepis historically worn by the particular branch or regiment. Line infantry caps for example had a dark blue base with a red top. In 1959 the bonnet de police was replaced by the beret for most units. In the modern French Army the bonnet de police is worn by the 1st Regiment of Spahis in the historic bright red of this branch and, since 2017, by the 1st Tirailleurs in light blue. The bonnet de police is also worn by anti-riot law enforcement units, such as the Gendarmerie Mobile of the French Gendarmerie (at least when in riot control gear) and the CRS of the French National Police. Members of these units may have to change quickly from an ordinary headdress to a helmet, and an easily foldable cap is therefore practical. Norway In Norway, this is known as b√•tlue, literally boat cap and is used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The Royal Guards use a distinct variety commonly known as gardelue which is worn in garrison and while on leave. Portugal Members of GNR wearing typical pointed bivaques, while patrolling a Portuguese beach on horse. In Portuguese service, the side cap is known as barrete de bivaque (bivouac cap) and often referred simply as bivaque. Two basic models are in use by the armed forces, the security forces and the fire services of Portugal. The first model has a curved top line and is used by the Portuguese Air Force (all personnel, except members of Air Police), the Portuguese Navy (officers and sergeants), the Public Security Police (all personnel, except members of special units) and the fire services. The second model is a pointed cap and is used by the Portuguese Army (only personnel in training) and by the National Republican Guard (GNR). Russia/Soviet Union Pilotka of the Red Army A man in Russia dressed as a veteran of the Great Patriotic War wearing both a gymnastyorka and a pilotka. In the Soviet Union, the garrison cap was known as pilotka (–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–∫–∞, from \\"pilot\\" ‚Äî the original cap was a part of the air force pilots' uniform in World War I). It was the most common type of cap used by the Red Army during WWII and after until the 1980s. The pilotka was worn during the summer season instead of the winter ushanka. It continues to be worn in modern Russia, although more in the Air Force and the Navy, especially among submarine personnel, where its compactness is inherently practical. In the Ground Forces the pilotka has been more or less displaced by the patrol cap and the beret as an undress headgear, although it remains in the regulations. Navy tropical uniform also features the peculiar vizored pilotka, to protect its wearers from the sun. The garrison cap was also the standard dress headgear for women in all of the Russian armed services (except for those units authorised to wear berets, such as airborne troops and marines), until replaced in March 2017 by the world- standard female peaked cap. Aeroflot flight attendants wear a scarlet-colored garrison cap with a gold Aeroflot winged sickle-and-hammer stitched in the center. Spain The gorro de cuartel ‚Äì referred to variously as gorrillo, gorra, chapiri or platano ‚Äì was modelled on the later versions of the French bonnet de police and has the same vestigial tassel hanging from the front of the crown. The gorro de cuartel was originally known as the Isabellina; a large beret-like headdress which also included a tassel and was worn by the supporters of Queen Isabella II during the Carlist Wars of the mid-19th century. It was in common use by both sides during the Spanish Civil War and continued in use by the Francoist forces after the war ended. It is now the distinguishing headgear of the Spanish Legion who wear it in barracks and on parade. Sweden In Sweden this style of headdress is known as a \\"b√•tm√∂ssa\\" (lit. \\"boat cap\\"). It is mainly used by the Swedish Police Authority, and also by Navy and Air Force personnel. United Kingdom King George VI and Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding wearing the RAF Field Service Cap in 1940 In the British Army, the first cap to be adopted of this style was the \\"Glengarry\\", which was authorised for all British infantry regiments in 1868 (although Scottish regiments had been wearing a round version since 1848 called a Kilmarnock Major R. M. Barnes, page 284 \\"The Uniforms and History of the Scottish Regiments, Sphere Books Ltd, London 1972 or Humle bonnet, which had been folded to make a side cap). The Glengarry was replaced for officers of most non-Scottish units by a cap called the \\"Torin\\" (similar in shape to the USSR's pilotka), which was worn from circa 1884 until 1896, when it too was replaced by a style for all ranks known as the \\"Austrian Cap\\", which had a fold down arrangement, giving the appearance when unfolded of a balaclava, thus warming the ears and back of the neck. The Austrian Cap (officially known as the Field Service Cap) was then replaced by an entirely different style of head dress in 1902 and so went into abeyance from general usage, although officers continued to wear them as a private purchase item of undress uniform. An all-khaki version was also selected in 1912 as a practical head dress by the fledgling Royal Flying Corps that went on to become the Royal Air Force (who continue to use the same type of cap to this day). In 1937, a khaki field service cap, described in an amendment to the Dress Regulations for the Army that year as \\"similar in shape to the Glengarry\\" was introduced as the Universal Pattern Field Service Cap, and saw extensive service during World War II as a head dress to be worn with Battle Dress when steel helmets were not required. At around the same time coloured versions were introduced for officers of both regular and territorial regiments, although these were an optional item and in the midst of war not every officer chose to purchase one. Nevertheless, some did and they were produced in a wide range of colours for the different infantry, cavalry and yeomanry regiments. Since the universal introduction of the beret in 1947, the field service cap continued as an optional officer's accessory to be worn in barrack dress (as an alternative to the peaked, khaki Service Dress cap). They are still tailored in regimental colours and have become less common with the introduction of Combat Soldier '95 camouflaged uniform (which for the first time serves as both barrack and combat dress), although they are still worn by the Rifles, Royal Artillery and some cavalry and other infantry regiments. A more obscure type known as the \\"Tent Cap\\" is worn by officers of the Queen's Royal Hussars only and is unique in that it is not fitted with a badge, but identified instead by its regimental colouring. Its origins lie with one of their forebears, the 8th Kings Royal Irish Hussars, who adopted the cap in WW2 to reflect their long association with the Danish Royal family, whose Life Guards wear a similar design of cap with their undress uniform. This cap is in turn based on the French, 'bonnet-de-police', that was worn by Hussars in the Napoleonic wars and after. The Torin style of cap is still worn by the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment and the Royal Dragoon Guards. In the Royal Air Force, a blue-grey field forage caphttp://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/0F179C00_5056_A318_A8D8F975CD47447B.pdf (sometimes called the 'chip bag hat') of an identical style remains widely worn with both working dress and flying suits. United States In the U.S. Armed Forces it is known as a garrison cap, campaign cap (not to be confused with campaign hat, a distinct form of headgear), flight cap, garrison hat, fore-and-aft cap, envelope cap, or overseas cap. =U.S. Army= General Omar Bradley wearing his garrison cap with the Army's \\"pinks and greens\\" uniform, circa 1949 When first issued to U.S. \\"doughboys\\" in World War I, the hat was called the overseas cap as it was only worn by troops in France who were given the French type forage cap, as they did not have their wide-brimmed campaign hats with them. The overseas cap could be stored easily when the helmet was being worn. A blue overseas cap was adopted post-war by the American Legion, but the hat largely disappeared from the Army between the wars, with the exception of the Army Air Corps (who called it the \\"flight cap\\") where it was authorized in August 1933Rottman, Gordon US Army Air Force (2) Osprey Publishing, 18 Sep 2012 and armored units. However it returned in 1939 with a finalized specification as of February 1941. The hat was widely issued from then on as \\"the garrison cap.\\" With the replacement of the service cap and campaign hat, the garrison cap was given branch of service color piping, as had earlier been the case with the cord of the campaign hat (light blue for infantry, red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, etc.). This practice was discontinued when individuals had to purchase a new hat if they were transferred to a different branch of the service. Officers' piping was similarly carried over from campaign hat cords and continues: warrant officers' caps are piped in silver and black, commissioned officers' caps are piped in gold and black, and general officers' caps are piped in gold.

The green service uniform was removed from use in October 2015. With the U.S. Army's introduction of a new service uniform based on the WWII-era \\"pinks and greens\\" officers' service uniform for 2020, a garrison cap will be included.Army Green uniform will include garrison cap, three optional jackets, Stars and Stripes, by Corey Kickstein, dated 19 November 2018, last accessed 4 July 2019 =U.S. Marine Corps= SSgt Karl Taylor, USMC, wearing a garrison capthumbright The overseas cap (\\"cover\\") was first issued to Marines in France in early 1918. Originally Marine officers wore red piping and Marine generals wore gold piping with all ranks wearing the Eagle, Globe and Anchor on the left hand side.p.13 Henry, Mark US Marine Corps in World War I 1917-18 Osprey Publishing, 23/10/2012 The cover was made in both forest green wool and khaki cotton. Usage is common in the U.S. Marine Corps as the headgear when wearing service uniforms (the other option being the bulkier frame-type \\"barracks cover\\"). In addition, it is the standard headgear for Marine Naval Aviators, Naval Flight Officers and enlisted Aircrewmen wearing flight suits. The Marine officer's garrison cap, unlike those of the Army or Air Force, does not have metallic piping; the only marking that distinguishes it from the enlisted cap is the placement of small officer's rank insignia on the right side of the cap and the style of the Eagle, Globe and Anchor. Enlisted garrison caps carry no rank insignia, however all Marine garrison caps carry the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor insignia on the left side. =U.S. Air Force= A blue flight cap is the most common headgear worn with the U.S. Air Force's service dress or \\"blues\\" uniform. The color of the piping varies: solid blue for enlisted, blue and silver metallic braid for company-grade officers and field grade officers, and solid silver metallic for general officers. Officers wear large metal rank insignia affixed to the left front of the cap in a manner similar to that historically used by the Army with their garrison caps. No other accoutrements are worn., Air Force Instruction 36-2903. The flight cap is also worn by members of the Civil Air Patrol in a manner appropriate to their rank. The company-grade officer version is also worn by United States Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC cadets as well as officer trainees at officer training school. Cadets in the Junior ROTC and Civil Air Patrol cadet programs wear the enlisted version of the flight cap. =U.S. Navy= Petty Officer Second Class with the former Winter Blue uniform In the U.S. Navy the garrison cap (\\"cover\\") was first authorized during World War II, originally for aviators and later for all officers and chief petty officers (CPOs). Blue and white versions, as well as a forest green version for aviation officers and CPOs were later developed, although the blue and white versions were discontinued after the war. Today, garrison caps in khaki are almost always worn with service khakis and flight suits. Officers wear a miniature version of the officer crest on the left and small rank insignia on the right side of the cap, while CPOs will wear a CPO, SCPO or MCPO fouled anchor on the left as appropriate. Like the Marine Corps, and in contrast to their Army and Air Force counterparts, the Navy caps for officers also avoid the use of metallic piping. The blue version garrison cap, essentially black, was resurrected in the mid-1990s for wear with the blue working uniforms. Enlisted personnel since 2008 have been issued a black garrison cap for wear with the new Navy Service Uniform. It has since been authorized for the officer and CPO Service Dress Blue uniforms. The garrison cap is also worn by midshipmen and officer candidates. =U.S. Coast Guard= right The U.S. Coast Guard issues the garrison cap (\\"cover\\") to all service members. The cap is serge and is authorized with Tropical Blue, the Winter Dress Blue, and Service Dress Blue uniform. Regulations for the placement of insignia are similar those of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Unlike the Navy, enlisted members in the rates E-1 through E-3 wear a miniature version of the enlisted combination cap device. Like the Navy and Marine Corps, and in contrast to their Army and Air Force counterparts, the Coast Guard garrison caps for officers also avoid the use of metallic piping. Serbia/Yugoslavia Serbian soldiers wearning a \\"≈°ajkaƒça\\" in the war 1876-78. In Serbia, the side cap is known as \\"≈†ajkaƒça\\" and was introduced to Serbian soldiers in 1870. It was an integral part of the uniform of Serbian soldiers in the Serbo-Turkish War (1876-78), the Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885) and the Liberation Wars (1912-1918). It was used as the official cap of soldiers in the Yugoslav Army and Gendarmerie in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the German-Italian occupation of Yugoslavia in the Second World War it was worn by numerous armed formations. After the war in the new Yugoslavia, the official cap was replaced by a \\"Titovka\\" which was of the same style as the side cap. \\"Titovka\\" was first used by the Yugoslav Partisans during WWII and later by the Yugoslav People's Army. The Titovka was named after Josip Broz Tito, leader of the partisans, who popularized its use during the war. Civil use A constable of the Uttar Pradesh Police in India in forage cap Officers and Instructors of the Australian Air Force Cadets are also entitled to wear a garrison cap with service dress uniform. Royal Canadian Air Cadets wear wedge caps in Air Force blue as part of their uniform. United States Civil Air Patrol personnel wear the US Air Force Flight Cap with distinctive CAP hat insignia. Senior members (ages 18 and above) will wear the company grade/field grade officer or general officer style flight cap, dependent on CAP rank, but will wear a small version of the service hat device in lieu of rank insignia in order to distinguish themselves from actual Air Force officers (e.g., those in the active duty regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard). CAP Cadet officers will wear the Air Force enlisted flight cap with cadet rank insignia instead of the CAP insignia, while cadets who are not cadet officers will wear a generic insignia. This hat is the standard cover with most of the Air Force style uniforms.CAPM 39-1, downloaded 10 Sept 2010 from http://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/u_082203102943.pdf Many uniformed civilian organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America (which no longer uses them) have used garrison caps. Waiters at many old fashioned style diners also wear garrison caps. The American Legion and many other veterans service organizations wear distinctive garrison caps.

Instead of being predominantly herbivorous or omnivorous like other murines, these rats feed predominantly on invertebrates although they do eat some vegetable matter. This vermivory is probably the result of a rat-like animal moving into an ecological niche usually filled by shrews. Shrews and other insectivores are absent on these Philippine islands. Taxonomy Rickart et al. (2005) found that C. mindorensis, C. whiteheadi, and C. gonzalesi are closely related whereas C. silaceus and C. sibuyanensis represent earlier offshoots of the genus. Several authors place C. silaceus in the genus Celaenomys, but Rickart et al. (2005) suggest that neither genetic nor morphometric distance warrant it. These rats are considered \\"old endemics\\" and are probably the result of one of the first colonisations of the Philippine islands. Other murines colonised the islands at a later time and are more closely related to mainland murines.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1990, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. Background Keyes was educated at Toronto Teacher's College, Queen's University and the University of Ottawa, receiving a Master's Degree in Education. He was a teacher and principal in Frontenac County for thirty- seven years. Municipal politics Keyes served as an alderman in Kingston for twelve years, was deputy mayor for five years. He was elected as mayor in 1976. He served two terms and left office in 1980. Provincial politics He ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1971 provincial election, but lost to Progressive Conservative W.J. Nuttall by fewer than 2,000 votes in the constituency of Frontenac‚ÄîAddington. He contested Kingston in the 1975 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative Keith Norton by 203 votes. He was elected to the legislature in the 1985 election, defeating Norton by 2,287 votes in the renamed riding of Kingston and the Islands. The Liberals formed a minority government under David Peterson after this election, and Keyes was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Correctional Services and Solicitor General on June 26, 1985.MacLatchie, James M. Violence in Contemporary Canadian Society. John Howard Society of Canada, 1987. 27. In late 1986, Keyes became involved in a political controversy after being caught sharing an alcoholic drink with police officers on a police boat in the Kingston area. He stepped down as Solicitor General on December 3, 1986 while the matter was investigated by Toronto police, and was re-instated on January 9, 1987. On another occasion, he provoked controversy by suggesting that some police services in Ontario were using hollow-tipped bullets, contrary to provincial law. Keyes was easily re-elected over NDP challenger Gary Wilson in the 1987 provincial election, but was dropped from cabinet after the election and served as a backbencher in the parliament that followed. The Liberals were defeated by the NDP in the 1990 provincial election and Keyes lost his seat to Wilson by 2,092 votes. Keyes supported fellow Kingstonian John Gerretsen's bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party in 1996, and moved to Joseph Cordiano's camp when Gerretsen was eliminated after the second ballot. When Cordiano was also eliminated, Keyes supported the victorious candidate, Dalton McGuinty. =Cabinet= Later life Keyes remains active in the Kingston area.

The style, now associated with the punk subculture, is so named because of the resemblance to the diadem crown worn by the Statue of Liberty, itself inspired by the Roman goddess Libertas and god Sol Invictus. History Liberty spikes trace their origins to the Ancient Britons. Warriors washed their long hair in lime water, which also bleached it blond. This hairstyle was highly symbolic as a badge of honor and manhood: Celts were not allowed to spike or cut their hair until they had killed an enemy. After the subjugation of Britain spiked hair fell out of use in favor of short Roman haircuts.Celtic Clothing In the silent film era some actors, like comedian Harold Lloyd, experimented with spiked hair to stand out from the crowd, although this trend did not catch on with ordinary people. This changed in the 1970s when the emerging British punk subculture chose messy, choppy hair in reaction to the long smooth styles worn by hippies and disco fans. Originally the spikes were small, as worn by modern-day pop-punk fans, but by the 1980s this had evolved to tall liberty spikes, sometimes over a foot in length. Liberty spikes were also worn by the Goth subculture, although in this case they were dyed black instead of the bright unnatural colors favored by punk rockers. There are also liberty spikes that make use solely of front spikes to look more like the crown of the Statue of Liberty than a proper mohawk. This type of styling is not easy by any means. Those who do it, spend anywhere from one to two hours, and they must be done every day because it can be very disturbing to sleep with. This form of liberty spikes is also known as a crown. Maintenance In this style, the hair is formed into thick spikes that may radiate outwards in all directions or all point up in the same direction. They are favored for their durability in extremely long hair. Liberty spikes may be enhanced by the use of hair dyes. Liberty spikes are also a common way of styling mohawks. Forming and keeping the shape of liberty spikes is beyond the capacity of some hair styling products, which were created for more natural looking styles.

The Hawaiian name is pulelehua. This is today a catch-all native term for all butterflies; its origin seems to be pulelo \\"to float\\" or \\"to undulate in the air\\" + lehua, \\"reddish,\\" or \\"rainbow colored,\\" probably due to the predominant color of the Metrosideros polymorpha flower: an animal that floats through the air, from one lehua to another. Alternatively, it is called lepelepe-o-Hina - roughly, \\"Hina's fringewing\\" - which is today also used for the introduced monarch butterfly. The Kamehameha butterfly was named the state insect of Hawaii in 2009, due to the work of a group of fifth-graders from Pearl Ridge Elementary. These 5th graders (Robyn-Ashley Amano, Ryan Asuka, Kristi Kimura, Jennifer Loui, Toshiro Yanai and Jenna Yanke) proposed the butterfly as the state insect to various legislators as a project for Gifted and Talented. Description The caterpillars feed on the leaves of plants in the family Urticaceae, especially those of mƒÅmaki (Pipturus albidus) but also ≈çpuhe (Urera spp.), ƒÅk≈çlea (Boehmeria grandis), olonƒÅ (Touchardia latifolia), and maoloa (Neraudia spp.). Adults eat the sap of koa (Acacia koa) trees. Taxonomy It is named after the royal House of Kamehameha; the last king of this lineage, Kamehameha V, had died in 1872, a short time before this species was described. The specific name tameamea is an old-fashioned and partially wrong transcription of \\"Kamehameha\\". The Hawaiian language has no strict distinction between the voiceless alveolar plosive and voiceless velar plosive; use varies from island to island, but today, \\"k\\" is used as the standard transliteration. The voiceless glottal transition \\"h\\" is distinct and should always be pronounced - for example, \\"aloha\\" is correct whereas \\"aloa\\" is a wrong pronunciation. Thus, while \\"Tamehameha\\" would be a legitimate transcription (though considered old-fashioned on most islands), \\"Tameamea\\" is not.

History The Special Libraries Association was founded in 1909 in the United States by a group of librarians working in specialized settings, led by John Cotton Dana, who served as the first president of SLA from 1909 to 1911. In the years prior to SLA's founding Dana and other librarians saw an increasing demand for the types of materials that specialized libraries could provide, and recognized that as information professionals working in such settings responded to the demands of their jobs they were creating a new kind of librarianship.Bender, David R (2003). \\"Special Libraries Association.\\" In Miriam A. Drake (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science. 2nd ed. Vol. 4. New York: Dekker. p. 2723‚Äì2731; here: p. 2723‚Äì2724. Also, many of them were working as professional librarians but largely without the professional support enjoyed by other librarians and professionals. The group sought to address their common problems by banding together. Their goal, as stated in the first issue of Special Libraries, was to \\"unite in co-operation all small libraries throughout the country; financial, commercial, scientific, industrial; and special departments of state, college and general libraries; and, in fact, all libraries devoted to special purposes and serving a limited clientage.\\" The SLA is now an international organization with members in over 75 countries and is organized by 55 regional Chapters. Additionally, the SLA also has a number of Divisions devoted to specific topic areas. Many Divisions also include Sections for sub-specialties. The current Divisions include: Academic; Biomedical & Life Sciences; Business & Finance; Chemistry; Competitive Intelligence; Education; Engineering; Environment & Resource Management; Food, Agriculture & Nutrition; Government Information; Information Technology; Insurance & Employee Benefits; Knowledge Management; Legal; Leadership & Management; Military Libraries; Museums, Arts & Humanities; News; Petroleum & Energy Resources; Pharmaceutical & Health Technology; Physics-Astronomy- Mathematics; Science-Technology; Social Science; Solo Librarians; Taxonomy; and Transportation. =Naming controversy= From the time of the founding of the SLA there has been some controversy surrounding the terminology used in the name Special Libraries Association. At the time of SLAs founding there was an almost immediate backlash against the term special library or special librarian. For some, the term was too specific in that it had been used on a limited basis to that time to define reference collections which were limited or narrow in some way. For others, the term was too broad, focusing on a general type of collection rather than the work that the special librarian does. John Cotton Dana himself acknowledged the inadequacy of the name in the years following SLA's founding but noted the term was chosen by default as no other term would be as accurate yet encompassing. This debate continues today among organization members and official name changes were considered in 1982, 2003, and 2009 but they were eventually voted down by the membership. Membership SLA membership is open to any person or organization. Members pay annual dues to SLA and additional fees for any Chapter, Division, or Caucus memberships they wish to obtain. Members of SLA typically possess a master's degree in library or information science and may have an advanced degree in a related field such as law, medicine or engineering. While special libraries include law libraries, news libraries, corporate libraries, museum libraries, medical libraries, and transportation libraries, many information professionals today do not actually work in a library setting. They actively apply their specialized skills to support the information needs of their organizations. SLA members fill many non-traditional librarian roles such as corporate competitive intelligence analyst, researcher, or information specialist. Given the rapid adoption of information technologies for selecting, analyzing, managing, storing, and delivering information and knowledge, the average SLA member might be performing a range of services and employing a diverse mix of skills related to, but not exclusive of, library science. In fact, it is likely a special librarian does not work in a library, but rather an information center or resource center. Governing structure The SLA is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the membership according to the parameters set out in the SLA's bylaws. The board of directors is responsible for the overall direction and management of the SLA and selects the organization's officers. The board of directors is led by a president who is elected for a one-year term. An executive director selected by the board oversees the day-to-day management and functions of SLA. SLA Welcomed Amy Lestition Burke, CAE, as its executive director in May 2016. Burke had been serving SLA as vice president of success since 1 March, when SLA entered into an agreement with association management company MCI USA (formerly Coulter Companies) to manage its operations. Each of the regional Chapters and topical Divisions of SLA also elects officers and conducts meetings in a similar fashion to SLA.

He stood in the 2005 General Election as an anti-war independent candidate for MP of Sedgefield, a constituency held by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Biography Keys is a founder member of the campaign group Military Families Against the War. His son Lance Corporal Tom Keys, was a Royal Military Policeman and one of six Red Caps killed by an Iraqi mob in Majar al-Kabir in June 2003. Reg Keys was an ambulance paramedic for 19 years in Solihull before retiring to Llanuwchllyn, Bala in North Wales. In the 2005 UK general election, he stood against the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in the Sedgefield constituency. Keys declared at the outset of the campaign that he had been a Labour Party voter and was still basically socialist, but that he was seeking election as a candidate opposed to Blair's policy on the Iraq War. He claimed that by electing him, voters could keep the Labour Party in power but with Gordon Brown as the likely Prime Minister rather than Blair. Former Independent MP Martin Bell urged the other parties to withdraw their candidates as removing a supporter of the war from office would send a message to President Bush and other World Leaders who had supported him. During the campaign, UK newspaper The Guardian's Stuart Jeffries asked Keys, \\"Is it difficult to be a political candidate in these circumstances, when you are still clearly grieving?\\", to which he replied \\"Yes it is. [‚Ä¶] I feel, though, that I have a responsibility to Tom. I keep going back to the words of a widow of a man who died on the Kursk [‚Ä¶]. She said: 'If you betray your country you are a traitor and you will go to prison. But if your country betrays you, what can you do?' I think I have an answer to that: we can use our vote to get rid of those people who betrayed my son and other men like him. That's what I want the people of Sedgefield to do.\\" Bob Clay, the left-wing former Labour MP for Sunderland North, acted as Keys' agent. Keys won 4,252 votes (10.3% of the total), coming in fourth place, less than 700 votes behind the Liberal Democrats candidate and about 1,700 votes behind the Conservative candidate. Blair won with 24,421 votes (58.9%). At the declaration Keys made a widely publicised speech about the controversy over the decision to go to war and the alleged deceptions made by Blair over the reasons for going to war. Blair listened to the speech with an expressionless face. Reviewing the 2005 election's most memorable moments the BBC noted: > Independent Reg Keys polled 10% of the vote in Tony Blair's Sedgefield > constituency on an anti-war ticket. But it was his moving lament for the son > he lost in Iraq that will linger in the memory ‚Äì not for Mr Keys' words > necessarily, although these were powerful enough, but for Tony Blair's > expression as he listened to them. 'I hope in my heart that one day the > prime minister will be able to say sorry, that one day he will say sorry to > the families of the bereaved,' said Mr Keys. Mr Blair's attempt to look > impassive and expressionless will, inevitably, be replayed time and again > whenever the story of his premiership is told on television. Although Keys did not defeat Blair at the ballot box, his campaign did not stop. The British government is now facing a series of legal challenges launched by the families of British soldiers killed in the Iraq war. Lawyers acting on behalf of ten families and anti-war organisations presented evidence to the International Criminal Court that Britain had committed war crimes in its participation in the Iraq war. They argued that British forces were directed in a manner disproportionate to the stated objective of the war, namely disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. They further argued that there is, at the very least, a reasonable suspicion that the Prime Minister committed Britain to war on the basis of regime change. This charge is all the more serious in the light of the fact that Blair was given unambiguous advice from the Attorney General and the Foreign Office that to invade Iraq on the basis of regime change would be illegal. Keys and other families of British soldiers killed in Iraq are also launching a separate legal action if the Prime Minister does not convene a full, public, and independent inquiry into the legality of the Iraq war. Using the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its British counterpart, the Human Rights Act, they will argue that, if it can be shown that soldiers were sent to war on an illegal basis, it would have been an infringement of their Article 2 right under the ECHR which imposes an obligation on governments to protect the lives of those under their authority and control. In 2015, the BBC announced that it was to produce a biographical drama film about Keys' life called Reg. In the film, broadcast on 6 June 2016, Keys was portrayed by Academy Award-nominated actor Tim Roth and the script was by Jimmy McGovern and Robert Pugh. Spectre In August 2006, Reg Keys and other relatives of military personnel killed in Iraq announced the creation of a new political party named Spectre. The party's aims and objectives included bringing the Government to account for misleading Parliament over Iraq, supporting wounded troops returning from Iraq, raising serving soldiers‚Äô concerns over Iraq and highlight equipment and system failures. At the launch it was stated that the party planned to contest more than 70 seats currently held by pro-war Labour MPs, including Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, Ruth Kelly, the Communities and Local Government secretary and Jack Straw, Leader of the Commons. Keys also aimed to stand candidates in Parliamentary by-elections. In the event Spectre was never registered as a political party with the Electoral Commission, and did not contest any by-elections or any seat at the 2010 general election.

Tannenbaum was born in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, to Sam and Anna Tannenbaum (n√©e Schwartz), and moved to the Lower East Side of Manhattan at the age of three; his family later relocated to Brooklyn. He quit school at the age of 17 to work as a stock boy in the garment district. After a stint as a salesman, he began work at the Loch Sheldrake Country Club, which was owned by his father. When Tannenbaum was 25, he met a guest at the club by the name of Jacob \\"Gurrah\\" Shapiro, a close associate of infamous Jewish gangster Lepke Buchalter. Shapiro felt that Tannenbaum had what it took to become a mob hitman, and introduced him to the underworld. Tannenbaum progressed rapidly through the ranks of organized criminal violence. He began as an enforcer and strikebreaker being paid $50 a week; his salary was raised to $75 and then later to $100. When he became a full-fledged contract killer in Murder, Inc., he was paid $125 a week for his services. Perhaps the most famous murder committed by Tannenbaum as a member of Murder, Inc. was that of Harry Greenberg, nicknamed \\"Big Greenie\\", in Los Angeles on November 22, 1939. Tannenbaum had been assigned to the hit by Buchalter, who at the time was on the lam from New York District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey and was trying to eliminate potential witnesses that Dewey could use. Tannenbaum followed Greenberg first to Montreal and then to Detroit before finally catching up to him in Los Angeles and killing him under the supervision of (and with the assistance of) the Syndicate's West Coast representative, Bugsy Siegel. Tannenbaum's slaying of Greenberg is generally regarded as the first-ever mob assassination in Southern California. However, in 1940, under pressure from Brooklyn authorities, Tannenbaum became a \\"stool pigeon\\" himself, testifying in Buchalter's trial about the involvement of Lepke and Charles Workman in the murder of Dutch Schultz, among others. In 1950, Tannenbaum testified in the murder trial of Jack Parisi. He lived in Atlanta.

This thwarted, she attempted to claim her father's then-comatose body and was finally captured by the police.Spectaculer Spider-Man #232. Marvel Comics. Later, she was involved in the resurrection of Doctor Octopus. The cult group known as The Hand, working for Rose, dug up Octavius' corpse and brought him back from the dead, albeit with large mental gaps.

The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #28. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities A demonstration of Lady Octopus's personal force-field. Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of these \\"tentacles\\" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The tentacles are also armed with lasers. Through the tentacles, Lady Octopus seems able to interface with appropriately equipped computer systems and enter virtual-reality interfaces telepathically. The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack. The weak point of the force field is around the tentacles themselves, something Scarlet Spider took advantage of with his impact webbing. Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering. Other versions =MC2= A version of her in the MC2 alternate future series Spider-Girl returned to supervillainy years after Otto Octavius's death, initially reclaiming the 'Doctor Octopus' title. Intending to create mutate soldiers for the mob, Carolyn Trainer briefly turned John Jameson back into Man-Wolf, before beating Spider-Girl in a pitched battle. Later, she freed crime boss Canis from prison in the hope of uniting to take over the criminal underworld and oppose the Black Tarantula; it turned out she was in fact working for the Tarantula, setting Canis up for a fall. Spider-Girl battled her once again and finally took her down. In other media =Television= * Lady Octopus appears in the 2017 Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Kari Wahlgren. This version has a Ph.D in electronics, which she used to fake her criminal record and be put in a cell next to Doctor Octopus in a superhuman prison called the Cellar. In the episode \\"Between an Ock and a Hard Place\\", Doctor Octopus manipulated Lady Octopus into obtaining crystals for a modified neuro cortex so he could enhance his mind. After Spider-Man defeated her, she learned she had been manipulated and sought revenge. To achieve this, she and Spider-Man fought Doc Ock and put him into a coma. Following the fight, she reliquished her tentacle harness and left. =Film= * A variation of Lady Octopus appears in the 2018 animated feature film Spider-Man: Into the Spider- Verse, voiced by Kathryn Hahn. Dr. Olivia \\"Liv\\" Octavius is the head scientist of Alchemax and Kingpin's right-hand woman, who sports a large beehive hairstyle and glasses with octagonal lenses, while her robotic tentacles are pneumatic tubes tipped with claws. In the film, she and her fellow Alchemax scientists build the super collider, which Kingpin plans to use to access different dimensions and reunite with an alternate version of his family after his version died in a car crash. However, the collider proves to be unstable and inadvertently brings several alternate Spider-Men to their universe. While attempting to learn more about the collider, Miles Morales and Peter B. Parker encounter Liv, who attacks and chases them into the nearby woods before they are saved by Spider-Gwen. Liv later accompanies Kingpin and his other henchmen in confronting the heroes at May Parker's house to recover a USB drive capable of foiling Kingpin's plans and at the collider just as Kingpin enacted his plans. During the latter battle, Liv was hit by a truck after the collider went haywire and fused her dimension with aspects of several others. =Video games= * A variation of Lady Octopus appears as a boss character in Spider- Man: Shattered Dimensions, voiced by Tara Strong.Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Achievements Dr. Serena Patel of the year 2099 is the head scientist of Alchemax's Shadow Division, which is dedicated to the secretive creation of dangerous super-weapons and twisted experiments. To assist in her work, Patel creates a battle suit with six high-tech mechanical arms and gives herself the \\"Doctor Octopus\\" title after her idol, Dr. Otto Octavius. Patel also uses her genius to create a new Hobgoblin with Alchemax's technology and manipulate Kron Stone after he became the Scorpion into helping her. After Hobgoblin and Scorpion are defeated, Doctor Octopus finds a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos and goes mad with power. She builds a condensed matter reactor powered by the fragment to wreak havoc and take over the world. Discovered by the Spider-Man of her time, she releases mutated creatures to kill him. After shutting several secondary reactors powering her machine, Spider-Man confronts Doctor Octopus in the main reactor and defeats her, claiming the tablet fragment. * Lady Octopus appears in a teaser image for season two of Marvel: Avengers Alliance that parodies the cover of the Days of Future Past storyline's opening issue.\\"Get Set for Avengers Alliance Season 2,\\" Marvel In Chapter 9, Lady Octopus is found dead alongside Armless Tiger Man and Shockwave; all of whom were victims of the Circle of Eight.

In the NBA, the play came into vogue in the 1990s and has developed into the league's most common offensive action. There are however many ways in which the defense can also counter the offensive screen. Execution The play (in its elementary form) involves three players. The play begins with a defender guarding a ballhandler. The ballhandler moves toward a teammate, who sets a \\"screen\\" (or \\"pick\\") by standing in the way of the defender, who is separated from the moving ballhandler. The defender is forced to choose between guarding the ballhandler and the screener. If the defender tries to guard the ballhandler, then the screener can move toward the basket (as the player defending the screener may try to trap or guard the ballhandler, giving the screener space) sometimes by a foot pivot (\\"roll\\"), and is now open for a pass. If the defender chooses instead to guard the screening teammate, then the ballhandler has an open shot. Alternatively, the ballhandler may pass the ball to an open teammate. A well-executed pick and roll is the result of teamwork, but many players fail by executing the play too quickly; they must ignore the defense and control their own speed. A forward sets a \\"screen\\" on defenderThe pick and roll is often employed by a shorter guard handling the ball and a taller forward or center setting the screen; if the taller defender switches to guard the ballhandler, then the offensive team can have favorable mismatches. The shorter guard has a speed advantage over the taller defender, while the taller forward has a size advantage over the shorter defender. =Results= A successful pick and roll play may result in the screener being in position to receive a pass with a clear path for an easy shot, with the chance of drawing a foul as other defenders move toward the play to try to prevent penetration. It may alternately lead to the ballhandler being momentarily without a defender, and thus free to pass to any open teammate, or take an uncontested shot, which greatly improves the chance of scoring, again with the chance of drawing a foul as the screened defender hurries to get back into the play. The success of the strategy depends largely on the ballhandler, who must recognize the situation quickly and make a decision whether to take the shot, pass to the screener who is rolling (if the defender switches) or pass to another open teammate (if other defenders come to help). The screener also must recognize the open spaces of the court to roll to and be alert to receive the pass and finish the play. Other variations Variations of the pick and roll are the pick and pop (or pick and fade), where the screener moves for an open jump shot instead of rolling to the basket, or the pick and slip, where the screener fakes setting a screen before slipping behind the defender to accept the pass. =Pick and pop= The pick and pop is an offensive play that is a derivative of the classic pick and roll. Instead of rolling toward the basket, however, the player setting the pick moves (\\"pops\\") to an open area of the court to receive a pass from the ballhandler for a jump shot. The premise of the two plays is the same: a ballhandler uses a teammate's pick to attract the attention of two defensive players to free his teammate for a scoring opportunity. A successful pick and pop relies on a ballhandler who demands constant defensive attention and a teammate with an accurate jumpshot or a layup if by the rim. Notable uses In the NBA, John Stockton and Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz used this play to great effect in the 1990s, leading their team to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998. Stockton, a point guard, was a good shooter and exceptional decision maker and Malone, a power forward, was a great finisher. When they were teammates on the Phoenix Suns, Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire also utilized the high-screen pick and roll to great success. The Golden State Warriors' combination of point guard Stephen Curry and power forward Draymond Green are noted for their use of a stutter step high pick-and-roll set: Curry's long-range shooting ability often makes him be double-teamed or become trapped, Curry will pass to Green as he rolls out of the screen, allowing Green to lead a 4-on-3 offense with the option to pass to wing shooters, lob an alley-oop or drive to the basket.Steph Curry dominating; he can thank Draymond Green, Sporting News, 25 November 2015 According to Synergy Sports Technology, use of the pick and roll in the NBA rose from 15.6% of total plays in the 2004‚Äì05 NBA season to 18.6% in the 2008‚Äì09 NBA season. Other sports The pick and roll is also used extensively in box lacrosse, the sport played in the National Lacrosse League.

The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Sara \\"Chibi\\" Taylor, rhythm guitarist Michael Rainbow, lead guitarist Michael Falcore, keyboardist Owen Mackinder, drummer Philip Elliot, and bassist Brett Carruthers. When the band formed in 1999, they were known as Imagica. This name was inspired by the fantasy novel Imajica (1991) by Clive Barker. In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song \\"The Birthday Massacre\\" was then renamed to \\"Happy Birthday\\". According to their vocalist Chibi: \\"it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil\\". TBM have released eight studio albums: Nothing and Nowhere (2002), Violet (2005), Walking With Strangers (2007), Pins and Needles (2010), Hide and Seek (2012), Superstition (2014), Under Your Spell (2017), and Diamonds (2020). They also issued the DVD Blue (2005), the live album/DVD Show and Tell (2009), the demo album Imagica, and the EPs Violet (2004), Looking Glass (2008), Imaginary Monsters (2011). History =Imagica (1999‚Äì2001)= The group originated in London, Ontario, under the name Imagica, with members using pseudonyms and nicknames instead of their birth names. The group's original lineup formed when Michael Rainbow met Sara \\"Chibi\\" Taylor at Fanshawe College, studying in the same fine-arts program. The two decided to start a band for fun as they were already hanging around writing music together. Rainbow recruited childhood friend Michael Falcore to join on guitar since they had already been recording music together in high school. Aslan, who was also attending the same college, became roommates with Rainbow and joined on bass. In mid 2000, Dank, a long-time friend of Chibi's, joined to play live keyboards but left the group shortly before they relocated to Toronto. After months of rehearsals and writing songs, they played their first gig on October 28, 2000, at Diversity night club in London. The band released a seven-song limited-edition demo CD at the show which had been recorded on a four-track cassette recorder during a time when the group was recording cover songs for fun. There were 40 hand-numbered copies of the demo which included the first recorded version of the song \\"The Birthday Massacre\\" (later renamed \\"Happy Birthday\\"). During this time, the band also met Rhim, Owen and Brett Carruthers who all attended the same college. In addition to this, later in October 2006, Terry McManus, Professor of Music Business and Entertainment Law at Fanshawe College, would join as the band's personal manager. Since its inception, The Birthday Massacre have described the band as an audio-visual project. In a 2009 interview, when asked about why they had started the band, Rainbow stated: \\"I think more than just being a band, it's a way to sort of incorporate, not just music, but other things. So I think more so than just music, the idea of having a band, and being able to perform, and being able to do artwork, to do music... all these different avenues.\\" Neither Rainbow, Chibi nor Michael Falcore had been in any previous bands and have expressed in multiple interviews that the group formed naturally as a result of spending time together as friends. =Nothing & Nowhere (2001‚Äì2003)= In 2001, the band relocated to Toronto, except for Michael Falcore who was already living in Toronto studying video production. They began recording a new album which they announced would be available through the official website beginning May 31, 2002, in another limited edition of 500 to 1,000. Shortly before releasing the CD, the band opted to change their name from Imagica to The Birthday Massacre in order to avoid confusion with a California death metal band with the same name. The band chose the name since people were already familiar with the song of the same title. In July 2002, the Birthday Massacre independently released a limited-edition CD entitled Nothing and Nowhere. In 2003, Adm joined the band on live keyboards and O.E left to focus on his own band Tepid Lust, later to become Isle of Dogs. The band began playing more live shows in London, Toronto, Oshawa and Montreal. Rhim was drumming for the band during these years, rotating between playing for fellow London band Aphasia. On February 9, 2005, Rhim posted on his LiveJournal that he was now a permanent member of The Birthday Massacre and that the band has his \\"110% unwavering, full-throttle, metronomic fabulousness... now 24-7.\\" 2003 also saw the creation of the band's Flash website NothingAndNowhere.com., designed by Aslan and the band which included unreleased music and hidden objects throughout the site. While studying fine arts, the group learned about color theory and chose the color violet to represent the band's themes. Rainbow said in an early interview: \\"Violet is the color of the tragic comedy. We associate it with fantasy and melancholy. These themes make up much of the band's lyrical inspiration. The color also mirrors our sound dynamic. Our music mixes contrasting elements. In turn, violet is the sum of two contrasting colors: Red and Blue.\\" The band established their signature sound and visuals during this time and later when they signed to their labels retained complete artistic freedom. =Violet (2004‚Äì2006)= On July 20, 2004, the Birthday Massacre again independently released an EP, Violet, and at the end of the year, re-released Nothing with new sleeve artwork. In the fall of 2004, Kai Schmidt, former member of electronic group Funker Vogt, signed the band to his label in Germany. They released a remastered and expanded LP version of Violet in Europe, including updated album art in a Digipak case. Adm left the band shortly before signing to Repo Records and can be seen in the original group photo on the nine song EP but is absent in the Digipak and LP version. In 2004, Brett Carruthers briefly joined the band on live keyboards. 2004 saw the band touring outside of Canada for the first time, playing the states of New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland performing with American bands 51 Peg, Deadstar Assembly, Celldweller and Crossbreed. In 2005, the band signed to Metropolis Records and re-released Violet. In August, the band began a series of international tours taking them to Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Spain and UK. Also in August the band released a DVD with the video for Blue by Dan Ouellette. Owen joined on keyboards first assuming the name Waffles, then O-en, then finally using his given name. Owen previously met the Birthday Massacre when playing in another band called Electric Knife Fight and joined just after the Blue filming was completed and therefore missed making an appearance in the video. On New Year's Eve the band performed in Los Angeles, California, at Bar Sinister. In early 2006, the Birthday Massacre toured North America, playing across Canada, the United States and Mexico on their \\"Broken Minds\\" tour sharing the stage with KMFDM, Schoolyard Heroes, Suicide City and the Start. They toured Europe again with bands Das Ich, Jesus on Extasy and Dope Stars Inc; playing in France, Italy, and Poland's Castle Party 2006. Through its European debut, Violet ranked high in the alternative charts. In several countries, the band made it onto the front pages of magazines; performing at some of Germany's largest music festivals, including the annual Highfeild and M'era Luna summer festivals. Also in 2006 the band recorded a remix of the song \\"Straight to Video\\" by Mindless Self Indulgence. Later in 2008, the band would record a second remix, this time of the song Never Wanted to Dance with the addition of Chibi's vocals. =Walking With Strangers, Looking Glass, and Show and Tell (2007‚Äì2009)= On January 1, 2007, a demo version of the song \\"Kill the Lights\\" was released for streaming on the band's Vampirefreaks profile, which remained for several years the number one ranked profile for the highest number of listeners. In June, the band announced it was working on a new record with Canadian producer and engineer Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie and that Aslan was leaving to start a new project and that O.E would be returning to the lineup on bass duties. In August, the band began planning a new video to be directed again by Dan Ouellette. On September 11, 2007, the band released Walking with Strangers in North America, entering at No. 10 on the Billboard \\"Top Heatseekers\\" chart for September 29.[ Billboard Chart for \\"Walking with Strangers\\" by The Birthday Massacre]. Billboard.com The album was released in Europe on September 21 and in the UK on 22 October. Artwork was created by JUNO Award winner, Vincent Marcone of Johnny Hollow. In October and November, the band toured Europe and the U.K with German band Psycho Luna. Primary filming of the Looking Glass video took place February 10‚Äì11, 2008, directed by Ouellette. Extras were culled from The Birthday Massacre‚Äôs fan base and all 35 masks were handcrafted. The Looking Glass video was released on the band's official YouTube channel on April 1, 2008, and distributed as a video data file on the EP which was released in May 2008. It contained several remixes by electronic artists such as Dean Garcia, Jamie Miller and Dave Ogilvie. Beginning in June, the band embarked on a large American tour, opening up for Mindless Self Indulgence, and sharing shows with Julien-K, Fake Shark - Real Zombie!, London After Midnight and Combichrist.

During the spring and summer of 2009, the band went on tour with bands I Am Ghost and Dommin in both North America and Europe. In late July 2009, the band was featured on a contest called 'Book The Band', at Virgin Mobile Festival, which took place online and allowed fans to vote repeatedly. On August 17, The Birthday Massacre was declared winner of the contest and was given 100 tickets to hand out to the most fanatic voters. They performed at the festival on August 30, 2009, held at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. Chibi stated in an interview, that since the band is unable to write while touring, the band took a year off to write and record a new album. =Pins and Needles and Imaginary Monsters (2010‚Äì2012)= In early July, the band shot a video for \\"In the Dark\\", which was directed by Michael Falcore and Rodrigo Gudi√±o, founder and publisher of Rue Morgue Magazine. It premiered on August 28, 2010, as part of Rue Morgue's Festival of Fear and was released to the general public on YouTube on September 7, 2010. The video pays homage to A Nightmare on Elm Street and Legend among other horror and fantasy films. On September 14, 2010, the Birthday Massacre released the album, Pins and Needles which was recorded in Toronto and in a basement studio in Dundas, Ontario, hometown of Rainbow and Michael Falcore. The album marked the first time the band released all new material on an album and was produced differently from previous albums by using the same guitar and drums tones on each track. Album artwork was created by Vincent Marcone, as well as artwork contributions from Natalie Shau, and Aslan. The album artwork also differed in that it broke from the traditional silhouette art found on other releases. The band toured America opening up for Otep in July and August then in October toured the UK with fellow Canadian act Raggedy Angry. In November, they continued touring America on a co-headlining run with Black Veil Brides, along with Dommin and Aural Vampire as supporting acts. The band also made a lineup change by adding Nate Manor, formally of Wednesday 13, to replace O.E on bass. The tour's setlist featured five to six tracks off of Pins and Needles, with \\"Always\\" and \\"Midnight\\" rotating during different shows. 2010 also saw the launch of the band's new website TheBirthdayMassacre.com created by Owen and the group. In early 2011, the band played the Opera House as part of JUNOFEST with fellow Toronto band Die Mannequin and Montreal band Ariel. On May 21, 2011, The Birthday Massacre announced that Imaginary Monsters would be released on August 9, 2011, through Metropolis Records.

Music style The Birthday Massacre's musical style has been described as new wave revival, electronic rock, gothic rock, and dark wave. The band reports their favorite artists as Dommin, Aural Vampire, Die Mannequin, Schoolyard Heroes, theStart, Deadsy, the Faint, the Cure, Curve, Tub Ring, Creature Feature, Jack Off Jill, Julien K, Mindless Self Indulgence, the Knife, Depeche Mode and the Corner. Internet presence The Birthday Massacre Bunny Logo, which first appeared on the band's Nothingandnowhere.com website The Birthday Massacre have utilized the Internet throughout their career and are an example of a musical group that has evolved alongside file sharing, and advancements in audio streaming capabilities. Initially, the band distributed their music for free, using music sharing software Napster, in addition to sharing their music on MP3.com and their official websites. The band was active in updating their websites regularly, interacting with fans on their forum, and offering their site in multiple languages like French, German and Japanese. Early on the band encouraged fans to create their own content, and consequently the band saw a surge in fan-created content, which they organized on a webring called Violetprison.com, posting in 2003; \\"We want our fans to contribute and be involved so rather than telling newcomers who we are, we would rather our fans tell you.\\" In 2006. a Chicago-based Birthday Massacre street team put out a concert film from their US tour. It was shot in secret as a present to congratulate the band for completing a full tour of the United States. After a trailer for the film sparked Internet interest, the band's management agreed to allow the entire film's release. Called The Birthday Massacre Bootleg, it was re-released in high definition with 5.1 surround in January 2015. The band returned thanks to the producers in the liner notes of Walking with Strangers. When asked about how the band uses the Internet, Rainbow said in a 2009 interview: \\"It's also a way to you know, not just present the music, but make an environment, a visual environment around the music, which was something we were really interested in.\\" When asked about File sharing, Chibi said in a 2010 interview: \\"It's like the best friend of a band when you're starting up... But then, it's like the worst enemy... The Internet can take you so far.\\" Falcore says in a 2010 interview: \\"Once it's released people start downloading for free and not paying for it, you know, it hurts the artist.\\" The band has remained popular for over a decade despite receiving very little mainstream press or radio play, referring to themselves as the \\"Black sheep\\" of the Canadian music scene. Views When asked in an interview by PETA, what she thought about factory farming being the number one cause of global warming, Chibi said: \\"Our manager is really on the politicians about factory farming in Southwestern Ontario. Besides the cruelty to the animals, the runoff of the manure in the spring with the heavy rains is making the coastline of Lake Huron a disaster zone. He tells me that the beautiful stretch of sand dunes and beaches around Pinery Provincial Park and well north of Grand Bend (the big resort town), gets posted for no swimming half the summer. It should probably be posted all the time until they dismantle the factory farms in Huron County.\\" When asked in a video interview by TasteitTV about having to conform to society, Rainbow says: \\"...A lot of the inspirations and themes in the lyrics, and even in the imagery is sort of childhood, and you know that perspective of when you're younger... you lose a bit of that sense of wonder and mystery, which is really inspiring and gives you a lot of energy when you're younger.\\" Chibi follows by saying: \\"You have to be an adult, and you have to conform in certain ways because you have responsibilities now, whereas when you were a child, all you had to do is play games and lay in the grass, you know what I mean?\\" On the Blairing Out With Eric Blair show, when asked about what kind of advice Chibi would give to somebody who was thinking about committing suicide, Chibi responds: \\"Just ride it out because things can get better. When I think back to times in my life when I was having a horrible time, like I hated high school, I was unpopular, the whole thing. It became so irrelevant. It's like if you just give things time, you'll be like, what was I worried about five years ago? Nothing's that relevant.\\" In March 2013, the band announced their support for same-sex marriage and LGBT rights.

He founded several major banks and universities and served as Minister of Transportation of the Qing Empire. He was also known as Sheng Gongbao ().  Biography  Sheng was born into a family of officials, and was the eldest of six children. Sheng's father was also a close friend of General Li Hongzhang. In 1870, Li appreciated Sheng's talent, employed him as his aide and soon became his chief economic deputy. Sheng recommended that Li build more merchant ships in order to fund the military ships that the Qing government needed. Sheng's suggestion was accepted and from then on Sheng became well known for his career in ship building. Sheng Xuanhuai's calligraphy Taking active part in the Self- Strengthening Movement, He actively advocated using Western technology in saving the country from destitution. His influence was mainly felt in the southern part of China, specifically in Shanghai. By 1893, Sheng controlled China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, established the Imperial Telegraphy Administration and created first successful cotton mill in China. In 1896, he took over the Hanyang ironworks and related mines, along with control of the newly created imperial railway administration. In 1895, he founded Beiyang University, the first institution of modern higher education in China. In 1896, he also founded the forerunner of Jiaotong University, which was later divided into Shanghai Jiaotong University and Xi'an Jiaotong University. He also created eleven \\"first\\", including the first modern bank, first telegraphy company, the first iron and steel joint enterprise.... In 1897, official Sheng founded the Imperial Bank of China, the first Chinese owned commercial bank modeled on the Western banking system. The bank was headquartered in Shanghai and had the authority to issue notes from the Qing government. Sheng Xuanhuai was a founder and the first president of the Red Cross Society of China, and is widely considered one of the key officials behind the then fledgling movement alongside Shen Dunhe. After the Boxer Uprising, in 1900 when Eight Nation Alliance entered Peking, Sheng and Ronglu initiated the Mutual Protection of Southeast China, resisting Empress Dowager Cixi's Imperial Decree of declaration of war against foreign powers. Li Hongzhang, Yuan Shikai and other viceroys openly rejected Dowager's call for staging military actions against the foreign powers. In 1902, Sheng and British diplomat James Mackay negotiated and signed the Sino-British \\"Mackay Treaty,\\" which anticipated the abolition of extraterritoriality in China. In 1911, Sheng was appointed head of the Board of Posts and Communications, a high rank in the Imperial cabinet during the Qing Dynasty, until the dynasty fell in 1911. Sheng died at the age of 72 in Shanghai.http://www.britannica.com/facts/4/82476/ Residences Sheng's private residence in Beijing while he was serving as the postal minister, has since been turned into a hotel for the public. In Shanghai, Sheng lived a mansion constructed in 1900 at No. 1517 Huaihai Zhong Lu.Former Residence of Mandarin Sheng Xuan Huai Tongmenghui revolutionaries Xia Chao and Gu Naibin planned to burn down the building in 1911.

The city is located some 70 km to the north of the state capital Campeche. It is the seat of the Hecelchak√°n Municipality. As of 2010, the city of Hecelchak√°n had a population of 10,285. The name comes from the Maya words helel (savanna) and chakan (rest). It is at an altitude of 10 m above sea level.  Climate  History The city was founded close to a cenote by inhabitants of the former city of Xkalumkin, between the years 1500 and 1600. In this city some important historic events took place, such as the battle between Don Francisco de Paula Toro and the federalists, led by Don Felipe Montero, who was defeated. In 1840, the district of Hecelchak√°n included the towns of Pomuch, Pocboc, Tenabo, Tepak√°n, San Antonio Sahcabch√©n, Dzitbalch√©, B√©cal, Nunkin√≠, and Calkin√≠. Around 1846, the district of Hecelchak√°n included three parishes: Hecelchak√°n, Calkin√≠ and B√©cal. On December 7, 1915, when decree no. 51 approved a new law of interior administration, Hecelchak√°n became one of the eight free municipalities of the new state of Campeche. That law came into effect on January 1, 1916. In 1957 Hecelchak√°n was given city status by Governor of Campeche Alberto Trueba Urbina.

The words were written by Harold Spiro and first recorded by Hoagy And The Terrace Choir which was released on State Records in 1976 and the song is published by State Music Ltd. Used at the time of the miners' strike as a rallying call, the song is often interpreted to precede a battle of some kind - in popular thought it is the chant of an aggressive football firm or gang; yet, unlike many football chants, it contains no explicitly offensive lyrics and is known widely. It was described by Auberon Waugh as the national anthem of the working classes. It is also an integral component of \\"The Music Man\\", alongside \\"The Dam Busters March\\", the theme tune to Match of the Day and the Bagpipes tune to \\"Scotland the Brave\\". The same segment of Sousa tune is sometimes employed for club-specific football chants (for example Plymouth Argyle supporters regularly sing \\"Ar-guy-ull, ar-guy-ull, ar-guy-ull\\") and as a vehicle for exhortations to the players (a team that has scored three goals might be encouraged to \\"Give us four\\" etc.), an impromptu observation on the on-field action (\\"Send him off\\") or a taunt (\\"You are crap\\"). The supporters of Nottingham Forest used the melody with the words \\"Bri-an Clough\\" in honour of the then manager Brian Clough before the kick-off of each match. The singing would only stop once Clough had acknowledged the chant with a wave. The melody was also used by Manchester City and Sunderland fans for the chant \\"Niall Quinn's Disco Pants\\", in tribute to the Irish centre forward. The song was released as a single in April 1999, reaching no. 56 in the UK Singles Chart. The supporters of Valencia CF used to sing the melody with the words \\"Xe que b√≥!\\" which means something like \\"Oh! How good\\" in Valencian or Catalan. The chant formed the title and a great deal of the lyrics for Everton's FA Cup final single \\"Here We Go!\\" in 1984.

The report recommended immediate expansion of universities, and that all colleges of advanced technology should be given the status of universities.

An officer in the British Army, she worked for UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce), an international organisation that defends the Earth from alien threats. A fiery redhead, both in hair colour and temperament, Frost was a no-nonsense and efficient UNIT operative who nonetheless had problems maintaining personal relationships. She first appeared, with the rank of Captain, in the comic strip story The Mark of Mandragora, published in DWM #169-#172, written by Dan Abnett and drawn by Lee Sullivan and Mark Farmer. Frost was working undercover and investigating Stranks, the owner of a night club suspected of selling a potent street drug called Mandrake. At the same time, the Seventh Doctor and Ace had been drawn to Earth at the close of the 20th century by the alien energy structure known as the Mandragora Helix, which the Doctor had last encountered 500 years before. When told of Frost's investigation, the Doctor pointed out that another name for Mandrake was Mandragora. The similarity in names was no coincidence -- the Mandragora Helix had contacted Stranks and used him to produce Mandrake, which sapped the will of its users, making them susceptible to the Helix's influence. Together with Frost, the Doctor and Ace thwarted the Helix once again. Frost next appeared in the Andrew Cartmel-penned Evening's Empire (Doctor Who Holiday Special 1993), where she was now a Colonel (the result of a field promotion towards the end of Mark of Mandragora), and investigating the crash of a World War II fighter plane. With the help of the Seventh Doctor, Frost entered the mind of the dead pilot and discovered that the crash was a result of a collision with an alien spacecraft. The local records clerk, Alex Evening, had taken possession of the miniature alien craft and was using its abilities to turn fantasy into reality to kidnap beautiful women, placing them in an imaginary empire of his own creation. The Doctor and Frost entered Evening's empire with UNIT troops and managed to destroy the illusion, sending Evening into an irrecoverable coma. An alternate universe version of Colonel Frost appeared in the comic strip Final Genesis (DWM #203-#206), in a world where humans and Silurians were working together. There, she was a member of URIC, the United Races Intelligence Command, UNIT's equivalent in that alternate world. Other appearances Frost is one of the few characters from the comic strip that has made the cross-over into the other spin-off media. She made a brief appearance (holding the rank of Captain in 1980) in the Big Finish Productions audio play The Fires of Vulcan (voiced by Karen Henson). In a link to the 2005 episode \\"Aliens of London\\", a page from the \\"official\\" UNIT website created by the BBC for the 2005 series of Doctor Who mentioned a formidable female UNIT officer named Frost, who was stationed in Geneva as of the year 2006. In the episode itself, a female UNIT major general in a United States Army uniform, wearing a tag with the name \\"Frost\\" was among a group of \\"alien experts\\" killed by the Slitheen. According to the Series One Companion, early drafts of the script had the Ninth Doctor refer to her explicitly as \\"Muriel Frost\\", but the line never made it to screen. The situation is muddled somewhat by the use of Muriel Frost as a narrator of the episode guide in the children's Doctor Who Classified! 3D Dossier, which would suggest that she is still alive.

School holiday Last day in Tanzanian school. School holidays (also referred to as vacations, breaks, and recess) are the periods during which schools are closed or no classes or other mandatory activities are held. The dates and periods of school holidays vary considerably throughout the world, and there is usually some variation even within the same jurisdiction. Governments often legislate on the total number of school days for state schools. The holidays given below apply to primary and secondary education. Teaching sessions (terms or semesters) in tertiary education are usually longer.  Terminology  = December/January = In predominantly Christian countries, there are holidays in December and January, known usually as the \\"Christmas holidays\\", \\"winter break\\" or \\"winter recess\\". The first day is Friday after third Wednesday of December. They include Christmas and New Year's Day. In Europe, this break typically lasts two (or sometimes slightly less) to three weeks. In the southern hemisphere, Christmas is in the summer holiday period and the break is much longer (six to eight weeks). Late December or early January is also close to the perihelion. On December 21, is the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere is summer because days are longer than nights. = March/April (Easter/spring break) = In countries with a Christian religious tradition, the Easter holidays, which in the United States is usually sometimes known as spring break, is a holiday that takes place in the northern spring. The date varies mostly because Easter is a movable feast, but also by country and level of schooling. = May/June to July/August (Summer Break), December, January and February (Summer Break in the Southern Hemisphere) = In the northern hemisphere, the longest break in the educational calendar is in the middle of the year, during the northern summer, and lasts up to 14 weeks. In Ireland, Italy, Lithuania and Russia, summer holidays are normally three months, compared to six to eight weeks in Britain, the Netherlands and Germany. In the southern hemisphere, the longest break in the educational calendar is in the end-beginning of the year, during the southern summer, and lasts up to 14 weeks, from December 21 to March 20. Common practices and effects Summer holidays for most children are a time to relax, enjoy themselves, and catch up on studies, or to spend time with family or relatives. Many families travel together on school holidays. The Northern Hemisphere is on June 21 (Tropic of Cancer) while in the Southern Hemisphere is on December 21 (Tropic of Capricorn). School holidays have many effects on a country, ranging from the price of travel and holiday accommodation, which increase as demand increases while children are off school, to a change in crime rate: Example UK crime rate monthly figures. Traffic congestion and heavy passenger loads on public transport on school run routes may be worse on school days during term time. The number of families taking holidays away from urban areas can reduce traffic and use of public transport in cities while loading long-distance highways and means of transport. In some countries, i.e. Netherlands, where many families travel to their holiday destinations, the start and end dates of school holidays in different regions are staggered to reduce the heavy traffic and pressure on means of transport that would otherwise occur on these dates.https://www.government.nl/topics/school-holidays By country = Africa = Nigeria In Nigeria, the longest holiday is from Mid July to second week of September for Secondary schools and a longer duration within same period for tertiary institutions.

Summer is still a popular time for family vacations, and most have a 2 or 3-month summer vacation. The academic year typically runs from late August or early September until May or June, depending on the length of the year and number of the holiday, vacation, and snow days occurring during the year.

An academic year typically includes a fall and spring semester, with a shorter optional summer session. Many also have a short optional winter session. Some operate on a trimester calendar.

College breaks Colleges and universities vary widely. Some closely follow the K-12 break schedule, others have the same but longer breaks to accommodate students who live farther away and wish to return home for holidays. Most colleges and universities have the following breaks/holidays: * Thanksgiving Holiday ‚Äì End of November (The week of Thanksgiving ‚Äì 3 days before Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving Day, and the day after ‚Äì the Friday before the break is considered a half-day). * Christmas/Holiday Break ‚Äì mid-December to late January * Spring Break ‚Äì a week in March or April (usually starting on Good Friday) * Summer Break ‚Äì Early/mid May to between late August and the day after Labor Day in September Most colleges and university years are divided into two semesters.

Although historically the year was divided into three terms with an extended Easter break interrupting the first term, the year has been divided into four terms since the late 1980s (with the exception of the Australian state of Tasmania which did not change until 2013). Following southern hemisphere seasons, the main summer holiday between academic years encompasses most of December, all of January and sometimes a few days at the beginning of February, and always encompasses Christmas and New Year as well as Australia Day on 26 January.Official Australian School Holidays In year 12, however, the term ends in November; for those who go on to university, the term starts in March. New Zealand celebrates Waitangi Day on 6 February; the summer holidays in New Zealand may or may not extend as far as that day, depending on the year. There is typically a break of two weeks mid-semester (i.e. after Term 1 and after Term 3) and a break of three weeks in the middle of the year, although this can vary between jurisdictions. In the year 2000, due to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the state of New South Wales extended the break after Term 3 to three weeks, compensating by reducing the break in the middle of the year to two weeks. Historically, the Term 1 holiday have been scheduled around Easter, reflecting the three-term system's notion of an extended Easter break within Term 1; although since the mid-1990s this has gradually changed, and now only Queensland and Victoria tie the school holidays closely to Easter; the remainder of Australia and all of New Zealand now have a fixed length to Term 1 which leads to the Easter period falling within Term 1 in some years with an early Easter, such as 2016. Typically, the Term 1 holidays will run for two weeks within April; the mid- year holidays encompass the last week of June and the first two weeks of July; and the Term 3 holidays encompass the last week of September and the first week of October.

To get al balance in school days between spring break and summer holiday, the two weeks of Easter holiday can take place with Easter both at the beginning, the middle or the end of the holiday period. In some cases, when Easter is at the complete end of the holiday, Easter Monday serves as an additional day off. However in 2008 Belgium did not have the Easter Weekend inside its break due to the fact that Easter Sunday was on the 23 March and schools broke up on the first weekend in April 2008 and had the two weeks then. Croatia In Croatia, there can be anywhere from three to five major breaks throughout the school year at public schools, depending on the region.

This can lead to overcrowding in tourist resorts such as the Mediterranean coast and the ski resorts. To alleviate this problem, the holiday schedules are staggered by dividing the country into three zones. Despite these measures, the synchronized school holiday schedules still cause some crowding effects, as families head to popular holiday locations all at the same time. This can result in price increases and availability problems in some locations during the school holiday periods. Holidays are divided into three separate zones except for the first two holidays: All Saints and the Christmas / New Year. Germany In Germany, ~75 week days of the year are school-free days.

Other holidays are usually one week long, they expand if national holidays fall on the work days. The Autumn holidays (\\"Krompirjeve poƒçitnice\\" ‚Äì \\"Potato holidays\\") begin around October 31, which is Reformation day and November 1 which is called \\"All Saints' Day\\". The New Year holidays usually start around Christmas and last until January 2. In the middle of February there are winter holidays, which are divided into two parts. In each part there are other Slovenian students who have holidays. The second part of the winter holiday usually ends at the end of February. The shortest holidays are First May holidays, and as their name suggests they begin on around May 1 (usually on April 27, which is Uprising Against the Occupation Day, which is also a national holiday) and last until May 2, which is also a national holiday. There are also free days such as February 8 (Slovenian cultural festival ‚Äì Pre≈°eren Day) and Easter Monday, and other national holidays like August 15 (Feast of the Assumption) fall on school holidays and are more important to adults. Students from the last year of Primary and Secondary schools usually start summer holidays one week earlier due to the final exams. These holidays are valid for Primary and Secondary schools only and are determined by the Ministry of Schools. University students, however, have summer holidays until October 1, however the exams from spring examination period can be after 25 June and the summer examination period starts in September. Usually students have only one other holiday and that is the New Year holiday but it depends on every single college which days will be free for students. For example, in 2015, most university students also had First May holidays. Short holidays usually begin after exams and depend on how good students are at their exams or how many exams they have taken for each term. Most of the time, university students have holidays on national holidays. Sweden In Sweden, the school year starts around mid or late August (September 1 at the universities). The week before All Saint's Day (taken as a Saturday around November 2) primary and secondary school students have an autumn holiday. Christmas holiday starts around December 19‚Äì20, depending on the day of the week on which Christmas Eve occurs. It usually ends some days after January 6, which is also a public holiday. In March, primary and secondary school students have one week of winter vacation; the exact week varies by location. Easter public holidays last four days from Friday to Monday. Easter school holidays are either the week preceding Easter or the week immediately following, depending on location. Primary and secondary school summer holidays last about ten weeks, starting in the second week of June. United Kingdom School holidays in the United Kingdom follow a standard pattern, with a school year of 190 days of teaching, beginning with the Autumn Term, but the exact timing varies between countries and counties.List of UK school holidays Local authorities set term dates which apply to all Community, Voluntary Controlled, Community Special Schools and Maintained Nursery Schools. Academies, Free schools, Voluntary Aided schools and Foundation schools are able to choose their own dates but many follow the same dates as the Local Authority. Although these schools can set their own term dates, they are still required to open for the same length of time. Independent private schools tend to set longer holidays than state schools.United Kingdom school half term calendar In England and Wales, an academic year usually runs from September of one year through to late July of the following year, with the time split up into three terms. Each of these is usually divided into halves with a week-long \\"half-term\\" break between. Primary (1‚Äì11) and secondary (11‚Äì16) schools usually follow a 39-week academic year, while further (16+) and higher (18+) educational establishments often have 36 or 33-week terms, generally with no half-term break. Oxford and Cambridge have shorter terms still, usually 8 weeks each term. For English state schools, the year commences in the first week of September with a half-term break (1 week) at the end of October, and the term ends shortly before Christmas. After a two- week holiday encompassing New Year, the second term stretches to Easter and is of variable length to allow for that movable feast. It has a half-term break around mid-February. There are two weeks of Easter holiday, then the final term starts and lasts until the third week of July. The half-term break is at the end of May and students with exams will often finish their studies at that break and take exams during June and July. The summer break lasts for approx 6 weeks and was for a long time thought to allow children to help with the harvest. However as the harvest is usually late September this makes little sense. In actual fact it was to allow the middle classes to take longer holidays. In Scotland, the summer break is earlier because of the different day lengths and agricultural practices. Private (public) schools may follow different terms, and some self-governing academies follow different termly structures. =England and Wales= Summer holidays in State schools are usually between five and seven weeks long, starting in mid-late July and ending in early September. Schools have Christmas and Easter holidays, each usually lasting about two weeks. The school year is split up into three sections: Autumn term (between Summer and Christmas); Spring term (between Christmas and Easter); and Summer term (between Easter and the Summer holiday). Roughly half-way through each term, pupils will get one week off school, known as half-term. In the Autumn term, half-term often falls the week of Halloween and close to Bonfire Night. In the Spring term, half-term tends to fall the week of Valentine's Day. In the Summer term, half-term tends to be at the end of May with students returning the first Monday of June. Independent schools often have longer holidays including up to 10 weeks for Summer, but often have longer school days and sometimes lessons on Saturday mornings. See School Holidays in England for the impact of school holidays on tourism and life for parents and others. =Scotland= In Scotland the academic year usually begins in the third week of August. In October, there are one or two weeks off, which is the half-way point between Summer and Christmas holidays. The Christmas holiday usually begins a few days before December 25 and ends a few days after January 5. There is up to a week off half-way through the Spring term and a two-week break for Easter. After Easter is Summer term and the 3rd half term break is the half-way point to the summer holidays. The summer holiday usually begins at the end of June for most pupils in primary 1‚Äì7 and secondary years 1‚Äì3. Years 4, 5, and 6 have a period of exam leave at the end of April until early June, but may return for the last few weeks before the summer holiday starts. =Northern Ireland= Schools in Northern Ireland have similar school holidays to those in the Republic of Ireland. Schools in Northern Ireland have shorter mid-term breaks than those in the rest of the UK and, to substitute, a longer summer holiday that includes the whole month of July and August.

The main economic activities are industry and cattle raising.  Navigation  Presently only two parts of the river can be navigated: * The lower section, between the mouth and S√£o Fid√©lis, about 90 km. It has a declivity of 22 cm/km. There is incipient navigation carried out by small boats that transport mainly construction material to the city of Campos dos Goytacazes. * The upper middle section, between Cachoeira Paulista and Guararema, about . Despite the small declivity of 19 cm/km, navigation is restricted to tourist boats. Elsewhere navigation is hampered by various obstacles; waterfalls, rapids, sections with great declivity and various hydroelectric works with no locks. Other factors impeding navigation are the existence of highway and railway bridges, the proximity of roads and railways following the riverbank and the location of several cities on its banks.

The car's name is derived from Spanish for \\"summit\\". The hood ornament uses an image of an acanthus leaf. The acanthus leaf was commonly used by classical Greeks to make a wreath for use as a crown. In Japan, the Cima has traditionally been Nissan's rival to the Toyota Crown Royal Saloon G and later Majesta. The Cima in the first two generations was a more luxurious and larger version of the Cedric and Gloria, with the Cima sharing the V8 engine from the earlier flagship Nissan President, Nissan's alternative to the Toyota Century. The Nissan Cima was introduced in 1988 and was based on an elongated Cedric/Gloria chassis. With its phenomenal sales‚Äîabout 64,000 units sold the first year and 120,000 in four years‚Äîthe car became a symbol of the \\"bubble economy\\". The Cedric Cima was sold at Nissan Motor Stores, while the Gloria Cima was sold at Nissan Prince Store. Later generations of the Cima shared the same platform as the President, with the Cima being a shorter version, thereby allowing Nissan to continue offering the Cima at Nissan Prince Store locations. The later iterations of the Cima were exported to the United States as the Infiniti Q45. The Q45 was discontinued after 2006, however the Cima and the President continued in production until August 2010, leaving the Nissan Fuga to become the lone flagship. April 2012, the Cima name was resurrected, and resumed \\"flagship\\" status in Japan as a longer wheelbase version of the Fuga. The Cima nameplate was reported to be discontinued for the second time in 2020, due to declining sales. Nissan Cima logo Y31 : January 1988-August 1991 Nissan Cima Cedric in Japan Up until 1989, the Japanese tax bracket dictated a division point at the car being long, wide, with a 2-liter engine. Both the Nissan Cedric/Nissan Gloria and its arch-rival, the Toyota Crown were stretched to this very limit. When rumors came that Toyota was developing a larger, wider extension of the Crown, called the 4000 Royal Saloon G, Nissan acted hastily and could not get the wide version ready for the narrow version's launch in June 1987. The half-year gap in development, however, brought about many changes in design. This generation was manufactured as a 4-door hardtop, with no B-pillar between the front and rear side glass windows. Nissan Cima Gloria The Y31 Cima is available with a VG30DE or a turbocharged VG30DET. The turbocharged version was especially popular, leading the Japanese media to coin the term \\"the Cima phenomenon\\". The Cedric Cima was sold at dealerships Nissan Motor where the Laurel could be found in Japan, and the Gloria Cima was sold at Nissan dealerships Nissan Prince that sold the Skyline. The Cima was available with an electronically controlled air suspension and a center console color CRT-display for vehicle functions. Y32 : August 1991-June 1996 Nissan Cima (pre-facelift) Following the Y32 Cedric/Gloria's June 1991 launch, the Cima was redesigned and introduced in August 1991. The car is now simply known as the Cima, and remained the flagship offering at Nissan Prince Store locations alongside the Nissan Skyline and Gloria. Later in the year, Toyota launched the independent Crown Majesta competing with the sport-oriented trim levels. The collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble resulted in lower sales for either car, compared to Nissan's previous Y31 model and Toyota's S130 model Crown Royal Saloon G. Initially the Cima was only available with the VH41DE, a short-stroke version of the VH45DE found in the first Infiniti Q45. The air suspension introduced in the previous generation was retained along with Full-Active Suspension that was available on the US-spec Infiniti Q45. Its appearance was said to reflect a more British appearance, both inside and out. An analog clock, found on most US-spec Infinitis during the same time period, also appeared in this vehicle. AWD and a V8 engine were also added to the options list. Y33 : June 1996-January 2001 Nissan Cima Grand Touring (FY33) in Japan Unlike the previous, Japan-only models, this third-generation Cima was sold overseas--as the new Infiniti Q45. However, instead of the VH45DE engine, Nissan chose to continue using the VH41DE. In 1999, the Cima was exclusive to reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships Nissan Red Stage, while the President was now exclusive to Nissan Blue Stage locations. This generation was made available as the US-spec Infiniti Q45. AWD was still being offered in Japan only and it was the first car sold in Japan with side airbags as standard equipment. The styling seemed to resemble Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold at the time. This generation vehicle was used as a patrol car for the Saitama Prefectural Police Highway department. The primary competitor for this version is the Toyota Crown Majesta which also has a V8 engine. As this generation was sold at Japanese Nissan dealerships next to the Nissan Skyline, the Cima was given a performance-car appearance to capitalize on the popularity of the Skyline. In 1999, the Cima became the first Nissan with laser adaptive cruise control. File:97-98 Infiniti Q45.jpgInfiniti Q45 F50 : January 2001--August 2010 The fourth-generation Cima arrived in January 2001. The timing was early in the Nissan Revival Plan, so the Cima did not have the Skyline's FM platform. Instead, it features an updated version of the old President platform, with a new rear suspension. However, Nissan's new design identity was thoroughly worked into both the exterior and interior. This Cima became known for its unique 7-reflector headlights. The Cima was sold in the US as the Infiniti Q45. This model continued to be Nissan's rival to the Toyota Crown Majesta, and also competed for customers for three years with the Japan only Mitsubishi Proudia, however Mitsubishi chose to use front wheel drive. Nissan Cima VIP (F50) in Japan The new VK45DD direct-injection V8 features in the Japanese Cima, alongside the VQ30DET, both producing . The V8 in the Infiniti version produces . A BOSE sound system was offered in June 2002. A LHD version of this generation was offered for sale in China at the Shanghai Auto Show in April 2003. Due to tightening emissions restrictions, the turbocharged vehicle was no longer offered on the V6 engine starting July 2005. The Infiniti Q45 was no longer exported to the US after MY 2006. This generation of the Cima is very similar to the Nissan President. File:InfQ45.jpgInfiniti Q45 In August 2010, Nissan announced that it had stopped the production of both the Nissan Cima and President, which share the same chassis. The two models needed safety upgrades to comply with the latest safety regulations, but lackluster sales showed that the company would not be able to recoup costs. In light of Nissan stopping development on a Cima/President successor, the Nissan Fuga has become the flagship in its lineup. When the Fuga assumed the role as flagship sedan of Nissan Japan August 2010, it became the first time that Nissan didn't sell a premium luxury V8 sedan in Japan; the Fuga's North American cousin, the Infiniti M56, is offered with a V8 shared with the Infiniti QX56.  Y51 : April 2012-  Nissan Cima VIP (HGY51) in Japan Nissan revived the Cima nameplate as the long wheelbase version of the Nissan Fuga Hybrid. Instead of a V8 engine, the new Cima is now a hybrid sedan equipped with the 3.5L V6 hybrid VQ engine with maximum power of at 6800 rpm and maximum torque of at 5000 rpm) with an advanced ‚ÄòHM34‚Äô electric motor with maximum power output of and maximum torque of and high-output lithium-ion battery with a quick charge/discharge function. It also comes with Nissan's \\"Intelligent Dual Clutch Control\\", a one-motor two-clutch parallel hybrid system, that offers direct response, superb driving feel and low fuel consumption.

The area was long inhabited by the Lenape; after initial European exploration in the 16th century, the Dutch established New Amsterdam in 1626. In 1664, the English conquered the area and renamed it New York.  Human prehistory  Archaeological excavations indicate that the first humans settled the area as early as 9,000 years ago. The area was abandoned, however, possibly because the warming climate of the region lead to the local extinction of many larger game species upon which the early inhabitants depended for food. A second wave of inhabitants entered the region approximately 3,000 years ago and left behind more advanced hunting implements such as bows and arrows. The remains of approximately 8,000 such early encampments have been found throughout the city. The region has probably remained continually inhabited from that time. By the time of the arrival of Europeans, the Lenape were cultivating fields of vegetation through the slash and burn technique.Stevenson W.

This extended the productive life of planted fields. They also harvested vast quantities of fish and shellfish from the bays of the areaMark Kurlansky, 2006 and, in southern New Jersey, harvested clams year- round.Dreibelbis, 1978 The success of these methods allowed the inhabitants to maintain a larger population than nomadic hunter-gatherers elsewhere could support. Scholars have estimated that at the time of European settlement, there may have been about 15,000 Lenape total in approximately 80 settlement sites around much of the New York City area, alone. In 1524 Lenape in canoes met Giovanni da Verrazzano, the first European explorer to enter New York Harbor, who called the area New Angoul√™me to honor his patron, King Francis I of France. Dutch settlement In 1613, the Dutch established a trading post on the western shore of Manhattan Island. Jan Rodrigues was the first documented non-native to live on Manhattan Island. In 1614 the New Netherland company was established, and consequently they settled a second fur trading post in what is today Albany, called Fort Nassau. It was not until 1623, however, that the Dutch interests in the area were other than commercial, and under the auspices of the newly formed Dutch West India Company they built Fort Amsterdam in 1624, a crude fortification that stood on the location of the present Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House on Bowling Green. The fort was designed mainly to protect the company's trading operations further upriver from attack by other European powers. Within a year, a small settlement, called New Amsterdam had grown around the fort, with a population that included mostly the garrison of company troops, as well as a contingent of Walloon, French and Flemish Huguenot families who were brought in primarily to farm the nearby land of lower Manhattan and supply the company operations with food. Sarah Rapalje (b.1625) was the first European born in the future New York City. Later in 1626, Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island and Staten Island from native people in exchange for trade goods.Letter of Pieter Schaghen (not Peter Schaghen) from Dutch National Archive, The Hague, with transcription The Dutch took heavy advantage of the natives reliance on wampum as a trading medium by exchanging cheap European-made metal tools for beaver pelts. By using such tools, the natives greatly increased the rate of production of wampum, debasing its value for trade. Lenape men abandoned hunting and fishing for food in favor of beaver trapping. Moreover, the Dutch began manufacturing their own wampum with superior tools in order to further dominate the trading network among themselves and the natives (a practice undertaken by the settlers in New England as well). As a result of this increase, beavers were largely trapped out in the Five Boroughs within two decades, leaving the Lenape largely dependent on the Dutch. As a result, the native population declined drastically throughout the 17th century through a combination of disease, starvation, and outward migration. As the beaver trade shifted to Upstate New York, New Amsterdam became an increasingly important trading hub for the coast of North America. Since New Netherland was a trading operation and not viewed as colonization enterprise for transplanting Dutch culture, the directors of New Netherland were largely unconcerned with the ethnic and racial balance of the community. The economic activity brought in a wide variety of ethnic groups to the fledgling city during the 17th century, including Spanish, Jews, and Africans, some of them as slaves. Stadt Huys The Dutch origins can still be seen in many names in New York City, such as Coney Island (from \\"Konijnen Eiland\\" ‚Äì Dutch for \\"Rabbit Island\\"), Bowery from bouwerij (modern Dutch boerderij = \\"farm\\"), Brooklyn (from Breukelen), Harlem from Haarlem (formalized in 1658 as Nieuw Haarlem), Greenwich Village (from Greenwijck, meaning \\"pine wood quarter\\"), Flushing (from Vlissingen) and Staten Island (from \\"Staaten Eylandt\\"). Willem Kieft became director general in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft's War against the Indians. The Pavonia Massacre, across the Hudson River in present-day Jersey City resulted in the death of eighty natives in February 1643. Following the massacre, eleven Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch. Holland sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft, which took part in the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans, leading to a peace treaty on August 29, 1645, to end the war. Manhattan Island was in some measure self- selected as a future metropolis by its extraordinary natural harbor formed by New York Bay (actually the drowned lower river valley of the Hudson River, enclosed by glacial moraines), the East River (actually a tidal strait) and the Hudson River, all of which are confluent at the southern tip, from which all later development spread. Also of prime importance was the presence of deep fresh water aquifers near the southern tip, especially the Collect Pond, and an unusually varied geography ranging from marshland to large outcrops of Manhattan schist, a hard metamorphic rock that is ideal for foundations of large buildings. The Fall of New Amsterdam Arrival of the English In 1664, English ships entered Gravesend Bay in modern Brooklyn, and troops marched to capture the ferry across the East River to the city, with minimal resistance: the governor at the time, Peter Stuyvesant, was unpopular with the residents of the city. Articles of Capitulation 1664 were drawn up, the Dutch West India Company's colors were struck on September 8, 1664, and the soldiers of the garrison marched to the East River for the trip home to the Netherlands. The date of 1664 appeared on New York City's corporate seal until 1975, when the date was changed to 1625 to reflect the year of Dutch incorporation as a city and to incidentally allow New York to celebrate its 350th anniversary just 11 years after its 300th. The English renamed the colony New York, after the king's brother James, Duke of York and on June 12, 1665, appointed Thomas Willett the first of the mayors of New York. The city grew northward, remaining the largest and most important city in the colony of New York.  Notes   References  * Bridenbaugh, Carl.

For his organ building, he was awarded the Silver Jubilee Medal (1977) and the British Empire Medal (1980). He was self-taught and built his first organ in 1960. He specialised in mechanical, tracker action instruments, and was responsible for re-introducing mechanical action to Australia after it had been out of fashion for many years due to the convenience of electrical action. His tracker action baroque organs are particularly famous. Although sometimes criticised as having a unique and characteristic tonal design, rather than an authentic \\"organ\\" tone, this tone has come to be much appreciated by some authorities and players. Notable organs *Sydney Opera House Grand Organbelieved to be the largest mechanical- action organ in the world. It boasts a grand 5 manuals and 131 speaking stops, 4 stops more that Sydney's other notably large organ within Sydney Town Hall. It is high, wide, a total of deep and weighs . The four largest pipes of the Prinzipal 32' hang on the rear wall and weigh an additional 6 tonnes. Its format, such as the stop and manual names, like most of his other constructions, are German in nature. Ronald Sharp was recommended to be the organ builder for this job by the English organist and organ consultant for this job, Peter Hurford. Hurford's admiration for him had been won by the construction of the Knox Grammar School's organ on which Hurford had done a recording. Many people doubted that such a huge pipe organ, as proposed by Sharp, particularly one using mechanical key action, could be built by him ‚Äì or anybody. Controversy raged throughout the construction years, until finally Sharp‚Äôs magnum opus was completed at a cost of A$1.2 million, under the supervision of the NSW Department of Public Works, which was also responsible for supervising the construction of the Sydney Opera House. The Department handed over the completed instrument to the Opera House Trust on 30 May 1979 and the opening recital was on 7 June 1979. *Knox Grammar School organlocated within the War Memorial Chapel. Well known throughout Australia and the world by its many recordings some of which, as mentioned above, performed by English Organist Peter Hurford. This instrument contains the distinction of being the first major modern mechanical action organ in the country. It is a Classical style organ, with 3 manuals, 31 speaking stops, 1 coupler, opened in 1965. *Ormond College Organaltered from his design in 1992 and no longer regarded as an authentic Sharp. *Perth Concert Hall organopened in January 1973 along with the Concert Hall however at the time only the front pipes had been installed. It possesses mechanical key action and electric stop action. It contains 3000 pipes of which 66 are visible from the auditorium. It is regarded as his second-largest concert organ after the Sydney Opera House. *St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney organlocated in the triforium above the chancel intended as a two manual sixteen stop choir organ but never completed. Construction began in 1960 and was discontinued in 1971 with only two pedal stops (16' and 4') and fourteen manual stops installed. The current choir organ was completed by Orgues L√©tourneau in 1999 and is located in the Western Transept Gallery. It has 3 manuals and 46 speaking stops. Whilst it was made by French organ builders it was designated by the Organist at that time, Peter Kneeshaw, to be an English style organ suitable for accompanying the choir. Whereas the Whitehouse organ in the Southern Gallery was intended to be replaced with a much larger French style organ containing many more speaking stops for the solo recitals. This organ, however, was not installed in the end as the original intent was, due to unforeseeable complications. In spite of this, the choir organ is still quite an impressive instrument in its own rights and is quite suitable for teaching lessons and small recitals on top of accompanying the choir. This was his first commission as an organ builder. *A small practice organ in the home of Norman Johnston, 1964. *Wollongong Town Halla notable instrument within the Australian Orgelbewegung. It, alongside the Knox Grammar School organ and the King's School in Parramatta, stand as a turning point for the movement. It was a great success by Ronald Sharp. Unlike many Continental and North American Organ builders at the time, who were producing organs often of an excessively shrill tone colour, Sharp was able to impart a singing and refined tone to this and many other magnificent instruments that he built. It possesses two manuals and pedal with mechanical action with 22 speaking stops and completed in 1968. *St John the Baptist Church, Reida two manual and pedal mechanical action organ.

During one session in July 1985, he made some controversial remarks where he appeared to support some of the views of holocaust denier James Keegstra. After the meeting he told reporters that he did not know whether Keegstra was right or wrong in denying the mass murder of Jews during the Second World War. He later resigned from the committee. David Peterson distanced himself from the comments in a letter to the Canadian Jewish Congress in which he called Smith's remarks unconscionable.

The second of Todd's TR-I projects, following 1993's No World Order, the album saw Rundgren play all instruments during the recording sessions, whilst the songs featured his usual acerbic observations, wit and songwriting flair. Rundgren mixes uptempo numbers, studio gimmickry, and heart-stopping ballads on this mid-1990s release. The interactive nature of this release includes its enhancement for computer \\"play\\" with video experiences to every song. Listeners can literally play \\"Cast the First Stone\\" as a video game. \\"Espresso\\" and \\"Woman's World\\" are also interactive videos. The lyrical content is largely political and spiritual, with Rundgren expressing his outspoken views against conservatism, particularly on \\"Family Values\\" with its slams against Dan Quayle. \\"Tables Will Turn\\" is a song about social inequity and how inevitably the situation will change. \\"If Not Now When\\" expresses anger against those who claim they want positive change but are too apathetic to act. In accordance with the humanism which has always driven Rundgren's lyrics, in \\"The Ultimate Crime\\" he sings \\"the ultimate crime is not to care.\\" The funky track \\"Espresso (All Jacked Up)\\" is a catchy song about travel and having fun in life which could well have scored airplay but didn't. \\"The Individualist\\" is a laid-back track utilising rapping, as on No World Order as Rundgren reflects on his desire to see the truth of things and not be subjected to other's views of reality. It includes a humorous jab at Prince's name change: \\"Change my name to some funky fresh dingbat/Like 'the artist formerly known as TR-i'\\". \\"Cast the First Stone\\" is an example of Rundgren's heavier, more raucous electronic style. In it, Rundgren rails against moral hypocrites. It is similar in feel and sentiment to songs such as \\"Mammon\\" and \\"Liars\\" on his later Liars album but also to \\"Fascist Christ\\" from No World Order. In \\"Beloved Infidel\\", a plaintive ballad, Rundgren sings sadly of how the \\"weak are vilified and wicked glorified\\"; he awaits the return of the beloved infidel, which seems a metaphor for truth, when the 'liberation bell' will be rung. \\"Temporary Sanity\\", which has a rapped middle-eight, is a protest against the insanity of the human race's obsessions with wars and vanity.

It is located in Brownsville, Texas, United States, and serves junior high and high school students of the lower Rio Grande Valley and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The school is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brownsville. History St. Joseph Academy was founded in 1865 by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in the downtown area of Brownsville, Texas. The school closed and re-opened many times under the Oblates in its earliest years. In 1906, however, the Marist Brothers arrived from Mexico and re-opened St. Joseph Academy, and it has remained open ever since. Initially, SJA was an all-male elementary school; and in 1926 a three-story building was constructed, known as the \\"Old Saint Joseph\\", where the International Bank of Commerce now stands in downtown. In 1930, the first high school class graduated from St. Joseph, and by 1940, the Sisters of the Holy Ghost assumed the administration of the elementary school. The new campus, found on 101 St. Joseph Drive in Brownsville, Texas, relocated in 1959 from its historic downtown campus to its current campus on the wooded and picturesque banks of a resaca (a regional Spanish word for oxbow lake), serving boys from 7th to 12th grade. In addition, the original site became the parochial school for Sacred Heart Church (established 1912), under the direction of the religious order now known as the Sisters of the Holy Spirit and Mary Immaculate. The new campus contained many architectural innovations, including: separate low-profile classroom buildings centered around a large garden area of native flora, reminiscent of Mexican Alameda Central urban parks; unique offset vents and jalousie windows designed to maximize the cooling effect of southerly breezes; and the gymnasium with its award-winning design (highly unusual at the time) by which the entire weight of the structure is supported by four curved roof beams that meet at the center of the building. The school had been all-male until 1970, when Saint Joseph became co-educational and admitted its first female students into the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. In 1998, the school switched from now-defunct TCIL to TAPPS, and by 2004, the construction of the new administration and middle school buildings began. On October 27, 2005, the buildings' dedication took place in the middle school gymnasium. On 8 April 2008, the Mexican pop group, RBD, played at a private concert in Saint Joseph Academy's gymnasium after several students won a competition sponsored by Verizon Wireless. By June 2012, the whole campus in SJA got wireless network connection. Mission statement St. Joseph Academy, conducted by the Marist Brothers with the mission to serve the children of the lower portion of the Rio Grande Valley, dedicates to provide a \\"religious and moral formation\\" and a college preparatory education under the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church. According to the official page of the school, the SJA \\"endeavors\\" to form students that will succeed in their university studies, understand and love Jesus Christ, and participate in the mission of the Church, including Catholic social teaching on the preferential option for the poor. Every year, about 100 students and more than a dozen faculty members travel to several rural communities to do community services and conduct religious classes. The school also has a community service requirement for each student during the school year, and that chore is set up by the religion professors. In the early 2000s, the missions program at St. Joseph travelled to Tula, Tamaulipas every year; in 2012, they traveled to a Native American reservation near Gallup, New Mexico on a 10-day trip. Athletics At a high school level, SJA has baseball, basketball, cheerleading, dance team, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track and field. In junior high, which is only from seventh to eighth grade, basketball, football, cross country, track and field and volleyball are available.

It is a salt derived from hydroxylamine and nitric acid. In its pure form, it is a colourless hygroscopic solid. It has potential to be used as a rocket propellant either as a solution in monopropellants or bipropellants. Hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) based propellants are a viable and effective solution for future green propellant based missions, as it offers 50% higher performance for a given propellant tank compared to commercially used hydrazine. Properties The compound is a salt with separated hydroxyammonium and nitrate ions. Hydroxylammonium nitrate is unstable because it contains both a reducing agent (hydroxylammonium cation) and an oxidizer (nitrate), the situation being analogous to ammonium nitrate. It is usually handled as an aqueous solution. The solution is corrosive and toxic, and may be carcinogenic. Solid HAN is unstable, particularly in the presence of trace amounts of metal salts. Laboratory preparatory routes # Double Decomposition # Neutralization # Ion exchange via resins # Electrolysis # Hydrogenation of nitric acid # Catalytic Reduction of nitric oxides Applications HAN has applications as a component of rocket propellant, in both solid and liquid form. HAN and ammonium dinitramide (ADN), another energetic ionic compound, were investigated as less-toxic replacements for toxic hydrazine for monopropellant rockets where only a catalyst is needed to cause decomposition. HAN and ADN will work as monopropellants in water solution, as well as when dissolved with fuel liquids such as glycine or methanol. HAN is used by the Network Centric Airborne Defense Element boost-phase interceptor being developed by Raytheon. As a solid propellant oxidizer, it is typically bonded with glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), or carboxy-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB) and requires preheating to 200-300 ¬∞C to decompose. When used as a monopropellant, the catalyst is a noble metal, similar to the other monopropellants that use silver, palladium, or iridium. HAN also enabled the development of solid propellants that could be controlled electrically and switched on and off. Developed by DSSP for special effects and microthrusters, these were the first HAN based propellants in space; and aboard the Naval Research Laboratory SpinSat, launched in 2014. It will be used in a fuel/oxidizer blend known as \\"AF-M315E\\" in the high thrust engines of the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, which was initially expected to be launched in 2015, and eventually launched and deployed on 25 June 2019. The specific impulse of AF-M315E is 257 s. The aqueous solution of HAN can be added with fuel components such as methanol, glycine, TEAN (tri-ethanol-ammonium nitrate) and amines to form best high performance monopropellants for space propulsion systems. China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) launched a demonstration of HAN-based thruster aboard a microsatellite in January 2018. Japanese technology demonstration satellite Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration-1, launched in January 2019, contains a demonstration thruster using HAN and operated successfully in orbit. HAN is sometimes used in nuclear reprocessing as a reducing agent for plutonium ions. Bibliography *Donald G. Harlow et al. (1998). \\"Technical Report on Hydroxlyamine Nitrate\\".

It is the site of a large copper mine that was extensively exploited in the late 18th century.  History  The mountain was mined for copper ore in the early Bronze Age, as shown by sub-surface debris nearly 4,000 years old revealed during excavations in 2002. Since then access has been regained to the sealed underground workings of the Parys mine revealing further evidence for this ancient mining. Parys Mountain is thus one of the few sites in Britain where there is evidence for the prehistoric beginnings of the British metal mining industry. The 18th century miners recognised that they were following in the steps of much earlier workers, an observation that was then linked to the discovery locally of copper ingots bearing Roman inscriptions. In 1764 Charles Roe of Macclesfield was granted a 21-year lease by the Bayly family to work the mountain for copper. Rowland Pugh, a local miner, discovered the \\"Great Lode\\" on 2 March 1768 and was rewarded with a bottle of whisky and a rent-free house for his lifetime. Although the ore here was of low quality, this was more than compensated for by the fact that it occurred in two large masses close to the surface. Initially ore was worked on the surface from shallow shafts, next by open-pit mining and finally underground from adits or from shafts. The ore was broken into small lumps by hand, the best ore being shipped to Lancashire or to the Lower Swansea valley in South Wales through the port of Swansea for smelting. Copper was concentrated and extracted from the remainder using kilns and furnaces on site. It was also discovered that purer metal could be obtained efficiently, although in small amounts, by its precipitation from drainage water with scrap iron in purpose-built ponds. Associated with the mines, important chemical industries were established on the Mountain based on by-products such as ochre pigments, sulphur, vitriol and alum. The processes were described by the German writer and translator, Augustin Gottfried Ludwig Lentin (1764‚Äì1823) who visited Parys Mountain in the 1790s and published his findings in Briefe √ºber die Insel Anglesea: vorz√ºglich √ºber das dasige Kupfer-Bergwerk und die dazu geh√∂rigen Schmelzwerke und Fabriken (Leipzig: Crusius, 1800).Parys Penny Parys Mountain dominated the world's copper market during the 1780s, when the mine was the largest in Europe. Its rise severely damaged the mining industry in Cornwall. The copper from the mine was used to sheath the British Admiralty's wooden ships of war, to prevent the growth of seaweed and barnacles and to protect the wood from attack by shipworms. This increased the speed and manoeuvrability of the vessels, and enabled them to remain at sea for longer as there was less need to return to port for maintenance. In response to a national shortage of small currency, the Parys Mine Company produced its own coinage between 1787 and 1793. The Parys Penny, also known as the Anglesey Penny, was used by the mine to pay workers, and also by the populace at large. It is thought that around ten million pennies and half pennies were minted.P22, Copper Kingdom. Published by the Amlwch Industrial Trust. The mineral Anglesite with the chemical formula PbSO4 was first recognised as a mineral species by William Withering in 1783, who discovered it in the Parys copper-mine; the name was given by F. S. Beudant in 1832.  Modern day  A stream running from the mine through Amlwch contaminated by iron salts Drone footage of Parys Mountain and Cairn Windmill There is a waymarked trail around the mountain, giving views of Amlwch Port to the north and the nearby Trysglwyn wind farm to the south.Anglesey Copper Mountain Those wishing to explore the historic mine levels need to contact the Parys Underground Group. Since 1988, Anglesey Mining plc, which owns the western part of the mountain has discovered resources of 6,500,000 tonnes containing 10% combined zinc, lead, copper with some silver and gold and has permits and a plan to restart mining operations at 350,000 tonnes per year. In the late 1990s, surveys of the mine's hydraulic systems revealed that a large reservoir held back by a dam in an underground working was in poor condition. An assessment made at the time considered that failure of the dam was likely and that catastrophic failure could inundate parts of Amlwch causing loss of life and substantial damage to property. An added complication was that the water in the underground reservoir was highly polluted by copper and other metals and was very acidic. In 2003 a carefully controlled drainage operation was carried out which dropped the water levels by , releasing the pressure on the dam and enabling its removal. The removal of the reservoir also gave access to many more passages and to a connection to the nearby previously inaccessible Mona Mine. The entry into these sections was filmed for the TV series Extreme Archaeology. Due to the high level of soil contamination, little life survives on or near the mountain, but there are a number of examples of rare plants and bacteria. The bare, heavily mined landscape give the mountain a strange appearance which has been used in the filming of science fiction films and television shows such as a scene in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Due to the high chemical content of the water, snottites thrive in the until recently submerged passages. = Museum = Mynydd Parys is an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

Early life Pedro Mart√≠nez de Luna was born at Illueca, Kingdom of Aragon (part of modern Spain) in 1328. He belonged to the de Luna family, who were part of the Aragonese nobility. He studied law at the University of Montpellier, where he obtained his doctorate and later taught Canon law. His knowledge of canon law, noble lineage, and austere way of life won him the approval of Pope Gregory XI, who appointed de Luna to the position of Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin on 20 December 1375.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Pedro de Luna.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 January 2016 Avignon election The consecration of Benedict XIII In 1377 Pedro de Luna and the other cardinals returned to Rome with Pope Gregory, who had been persuaded to leave his papal base at Avignon by Catherine of Siena.McGinn, Bernard The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (Herder & Herder, 2012), p. 561. After Gregory's death on 27 March 1378, the people of Rome feared that the cardinals would elect a French pope and return the papacy to Avignon. Consequently, they rioted and laid siege to the cardinals, insisting on an Italian pope. The conclave duly elected Bartolomeo Prignano, Archbishop of Bari, as Urban VI on 9 April, but the new pope proved to be intractably hostile to the cardinals. Some of them reconvened at Fondi in September 1378, declared the earlier election invalid and elected Robert of Geneva as their new pope, initiating the Western Schism. Robert assumed the name Clement VII and moved back to Avignon. Clement VII sent de Luna as legate to Spain for the Kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal, in order to win them over to the obedience of the Avignon pope. Owing to his powerful relations, his influence in the Province of Aragon was very great. In 1393 Clement VII appointed him legate to France, Brabant, Flanders, Scotland, England, and Ireland. As such he stayed principally in Paris, but he did not confine his activities to those countries that belonged to the Avignon obedience. Following Clement's death on 16 September 1394, the cardinals met at Avignon. The conclave consisted of 11 French cardinals, eight Italians, four Spaniards, and one from Savoy, all proclaiming the ardent wish to reunite the church. The cardinals then elected Luna as the new pope, on the condition that he should labor to quell the schism, and should resign the papal dignity whenever the pope of Rome should do the same, or the college of cardinals demand it. On the death of Urban VI in 1389 the Roman College of Cardinals had chosen Boniface IX; the election of Benedict therefore perpetuated the Western Schism. At the start of his term of office, de Luna was recognised as pope by France, Scotland, Sicily, Castile, Aragon and Navarre. In 1396 Benedict sent Sanchez Mu√±oz, one of the most loyal members of the Avignon curia, as an envoy to the Bishop of Valencia to bolster support for the Avignon papacy in the Crown of Aragon. Avignon papacy In 1398 the Kingdom of France withdrew its recognition of the Avignon anti-popes.McBrien, Richard P., Lives of the Popes, (HarperCollins, 1997), p. 250. Benedict was abandoned by 17 of his cardinals, with only five remaining faithful to him. Benedict's rationale for continuing the rivalry lay in the fact that he was the last living cardinal created by Gregory XI, the last undoubted pope. As the only unquestioned cardinal, Benedict argued, he was, by right and by canon law, the only qualified candidate left who could validly claim the papacy. Following the Council of Constance Benedict's logic was not widely accepted. An army led by Geoffrey Boucicaut, brother of Jean Boucicaut, occupied Avignon and started a five-year siege of the Papal Palace which ended when Benedict managed to escape from Avignon on 12 March 1403. He sought shelter in the territory of Louis II of Anjou. Avignon immediately submitted again to him, and his cardinals likewise recognized him. Popular sentiment being again in his favor, he was recognized as the legitimate pope by France, Scotland, Castile and Sicily. After the Roman Pope Innocent VII died in 1406, the newly elected Roman pope, Gregory XII, started negotiations with Benedict, suggesting that they both resign so a new pope could be elected to reunite the Catholic Church. When these talks ended in stalemate in 1408, Charles VI of France declared that his kingdom was neutral to both papal contenders. Charles helped to organise the Council of Pisa in 1409. This council was supposed to arrange for both Gregory and Benedict to resign, so that a new universally recognised pope could be elected. To oppose this, Benedict convoked the Council of Perpignan but with little success. Since both Benedict and Gregory refused to abdicate, the only achievement in Pisa was that a third candidate to the Holy See was put forward: Peter Philarghi, who assumed the name Alexander V. = University of St Andrews = A group of Augustinian clergy, driven from the University of Paris by the Schism and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland in 1410. The Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw, then successfully petitioned Benedict to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413. Having lost the support of France and driven out from Avignon, Benedict by then had taken refuge in Perpignan, on the Catalan border of the Crown of Aragon, but Scotland was among the handful of supporters that remained loyal. Nowadays, the University of St Andrews's coat of arms/emblem still incorporates that of Benedict. Statue of Benedict XIII in Pe√±iscola, Spain. = Etsi doctoribus gentium = In part to bolster faltering support for his papacy, Benedict initiated the year-long Disputation of Tortosa in 1413, which became the most prominent Christian‚ÄìJewish disputation of the Middle Ages. Two years later Benedict issued the papal bull Etsi doctoribus gentium which was one of the most complete collections of anti-Jewish laws. Synagogues were closed, Jewish goldsmiths were forbidden to produce Christian sacred objects such as chalices and crucifixes and Jewish book binders were forbidden to bind books which included the names of Jesus or Mary. Those laws were repealed by Pope Martin V, after he received a mission of Jews, sent by the famous synod convoked by the Jews in Forl√¨, in 1418. =Council of Constance= In 1415 the Council of Constance brought this clash between papal claimants to an end. Gregory XII and Baldassare Cossa, who had succeeded Philarghi as the Pisan papal contender in 1410 and had assumed the name John XXIII, both agreed to resign. Benedict, on the other hand, refused to stand down. Finally, Emperor Sigismund organised a European summit in Perpignan, to convince Benedict to resign his office and end the Western Schism. On 20 September 1415, the Emperor met with Benedict at the Palace of the Kings of Majorca, accompanied by King Ferdinand I of Aragon, delegates of the counts of Foix, Provence, Savoy, and Lorraine, embassies from the kings of France, England, Hungary, Castile, and Navarre, and the Church's representative at the Council of Constance. Benedict still refused to resign, clashing with the Emperor, who left Perpignan on 5 November. Because of this stubbornness, the Council of Constance declared Benedict a schismatic and excommunicated him from the Catholic Church on 27 July 1417, and elected Martin V as the new consensus pope on 11 November 1417. Benedict, who had lived in Perpignan from 1408 to 1417, now fled to the Peniscola Castle, near Tortosa, in the Kingdom of Aragon. He still considered himself the true Pope. His claim was now only recognized in the Kingdom of Aragon, where he was given protection by King Alfonso V. Benedict remained at Pe√±√≠scola from 1417 until his death there on 23 May 1423. Crozier of Pope Luna, Museo Arqueol√≥gico Nacional, Spain. =Succession= The day before his death, Benedict appointed four cardinals of proven loyalty to ensure the succession of another pope who would remain faithful to the now beleaguered Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met on 10 June 1423 and elected Sanchez Mu√±oz as their new pope, with Mu√±oz assuming the papal name of Clement VIII, whose claim was still recognized by Aragon. The fourth cardinal, Jean Carrier, the archdeacon of Rodez near Toulouse, was absent at this conclave and disputed its validity, whereupon Carrier, acting as a sort of one man College of Cardinals, proceeded to elect Bernard Garnier, the sacristan of Rodez, as pope. Garnier took the name Benedict XIV,Pham, John-Peter. Heirs to the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. 331-332. but he would never get any importance. When in 1429 an agreement between Rome and Aragon was reached, Clement VIII abdicated in favor of recognizing Pope Martin V, terminating the remains of the Avignon Papacy. In return, he was appointed as bishop of Majorca. Burials Benedict XIII was buried in Peniscola castle.

The composite material is claimed by the manufacturer to have the unusual ability to conduct large amounts of heat and return to room temperature in a short amount of time.  Soldering iron  The split tip of a ColdHeat soldering iron The first two products were soldering irons powered by alkaline batteries. The manufacturer claims this soldering iron is unique in that its Athalite tip undergoes a temperature change from ambient temperature to approximately and back to ambient within three seconds when the tip is removed from the work. The tip of this apparatus is split into two sections that completes an electrical circuit when a low electrical resistance is placed across the tip; e.g. metallic contacts, or solder. With a current flowing, the resistance of both the solder and the tip produces enough heat to increase the temperature beyond the melting point of solder. For the light-duty work it was designed for, the Athalite tip heats just enough and can cool very rapidly; however, if applied to something with large thermal capacity such as a metal chassis, the tip can become extremely hot and can take over a minute to cool in an extreme case. It is thought that the irons cannot be used indiscriminately for all work; the voltage across and current through the tip can damage electronic circuits being soldered. When not in contact with a joint, the split tip has 6 or more volts across it, enough to destroy semiconductor p-n junctions on contact if the iron accidentally touches multiple closely spaced pads. This is not static-electricity damage; any voltage over about 0.7V capable of delivering high current can destroy a semiconductor junction. According to ColdHeat: > It's a common misunderstanding that high current in the joint causes the > heat. The heat is generated by resistance within the tip. Heat is then > conducted to the joint just as in traditional solder tools. Also, current in > the joint is limited to the small region between the two tip halves and > doesn't pass through the part being soldered. There is a tiny transient > voltage when the tool is applied or removed, but it is orders of magnitude > below the levels that cause static-electricity damage. = Criticism = The tip is reported to be very easily damaged mechanically. The unit does not have enough power for effective desoldering of many board- and chassis-mounted components. The design of the tip is incompatible with some soldering techniques such as dragging or continuous-flow soldering (a popular technique for hand-soldering high-pin-count SMT packages, based on the principles of wave soldering). One thorough review of the ColdHeat soldering iron noted: :\\"For the electronics hobbyist, one particularly disconcerting side-effect of the Coldheat way of doing things is that localised arcing and sparking may be produced sporadically when the heating circuit opens or closes. ... sparks anywhere near a semiconductor are an anathema to the electronics enthusiast. High reverse voltages can be produced in inductive circuits as well. ...\\" :\\"The overall results of the soldering exercise were very disappointing. ... the test results on the PCB were of extremely mixed quality. ... The quality of the soldered joints was extremely inconsistent, due to the lack of temperature control and other variables that affect the finished joint. ... perhaps 20% of the finished joints being of a reasonably good standard... It was difficult to feed solder onto the joint at a consistent rate because the heating effect was variable. ...The dull crystalline appearance of many joints points to inadequate heating, caused by the heat not sinking throughout the joint sufficiently to melt the solder thoroughly, before the iron was removed. Although a grey crystalline joint will often form a sufficiently working joint for non-critical applications, the circuit might have an intermittent fault because of this. ...\\" :\\"There is ... no escaping the most fundamental principle of soldering: in order to make a good quality solder joint, all parts should be heated to the melting point of the solder so that it can flow properly. In the case of \\"cold-soldering\\" a PCB ... only one half of the joint can effectively be heated by the iron, e.g. a cropped resistor lead that you use to short out the electrodes to generate heat. Solder can then melt onto the hot leadout but it is then forced to flow onto the other component (the PCB copper pad) which is completely cold. Inadequate through-heating of components is the main cause of dry (gray) solder joints. What little heat there is, sinks away through the workpiece and the solder never flows properly. A crystalline, dull and brittle joint is formed. ...with our test circuit board... three PCB copper pads were damaged by excess heat, causing the copper track to lift away from the laminate altogether. ... Unfortunately we failed to finish and test our sample board successfully, due to the damage caused to three copper pads.\\" :\\"... With just a little practice with an ordinary electric iron ...it is perfectly possible for any novice or hobbyist to produce good quality consistent results ...that are superior ‚Äì and faster ‚Äì than the Coldheat principle. ...\\" :\\"Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt recommend the Coldheat soldering iron to the average electronics constructor unless they are extremely accident-prone, lacking confidence or have a real need to go cordless: they should save money and buy an ordinary electric iron instead. ...Users stand a much better chance of producing a higher quality and more consistent solder joint with an ordinary iron using accepted techniques... .\\" Athalite Athalite is a highly malleable, yet fragile, composite material. The name is derived from \\"Accelerated THermal Action\\". It is most likely composed of graphite. It might also be formed by other materials containing semiconductive elements such as germanium or silicon, as stated in the patent application. A nickel-chromium or other resistive alloy is another possibility listed in the application, but is unlikely to have been used.  Other products  Prior to the website's closure, ColdHeat featured products other than the soldering tool that use the same technology, including a cordless hot-melt glue gun called Freestyle. It heats up much more quickly than others (but not instantly like the solder tool.) It comes with a built-in stand, a pack of mini glue sticks, rechargeable battery, battery charger with its AC adapter, and an instructional manual and a book with different project ideas. However, much like the soldering tool, the Freestyle also had quality issues, usually related to the battery charge, and the heating element. There is a model that runs on AA batteries, for those who prefer their convenience. ColdHeat had recently released a cordless heated seat, as well as a selection of heated pet beds.  Current status  ColdHeat signed a licensing deal with Weller/Cooper Tools in November 2005. Weller sold the ColdHeat Pro as the Weller CHT100.

Sungenis (born ca. 1955) is an American Traditionalist Catholic known for his Catholic apologetics and his advocacy of a pseudoscientific belief that the Earth is the center of the universe and conspiracy theories.https://www.popsci.com/article/science/how-conspiracy-theorist-duped- worlds-biggest-physicists/ He has made statements about Jews and Judaism which have been criticized as being antisemitic, which he denies. Sungenis is a member of the Kolbe Center for the Study of Creation, a Catholic Young Earth creationist group.  Life and career  Robert Sungenis was brought up in a Roman Catholic household and converted to become a Protestant as a young man. He obtained his B.A. in religion from George Washington University in 1979, an M.A. in theology from Westminster Theological Seminary, a Presbyterian and Reformed Christian seminary located in Glenside, Pennsylvania, in 1982. He reverted to Roman Catholicism in 1992. In 2006 he received a Ph.D. in religious studies from the Calamus International University, an unaccredited distance-learning institution incorporated in the Republic of Vanuatu.On CIU, see: States have had lists of unaccredited institutions which include CIU. *Maine: *Michigan: (no longer being maintained) *Texas: Catholic apologetics After his conversion back to Roman Catholicism, Sungenis became known as a Traditionalist Catholic. He wrote Not By Faith Alone, a book of apologetics, explaining his view of the Catholic Church's doctrine of justification and his critique of the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone. Jews and Judaism Sungenis' writings include antisemitic ideas, sources, and claims about the Jews and Judaism and have been sharply criticized by fellow Catholics and by the Southern Poverty Law Center, as has the publishing company he founded and uses to publish his books, Catholic Apologetics International. In 2002, he said it was a fact that no one had ever proven that 6 million Jews died during the Holocaust and that demographic statistics show no real difference in the number of Jews living before and after World War II (see Historical Jewish population comparisons). According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, he also \\"repeated a series of ancient anti-Semitic canards\\" and later wrote about the involvement of Jews and Israel in a Zionist Satanic conspiracy aimed at Satan ruling the world. In 2006 Sungenis campaigned against a sentence in the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults (USCCA) which at that time read, \\"Thus the covenant that God made with the Jewish people through Moses remains eternally valid for them.\\" Sungenis believed it implied that the Jews can be saved without believing in Jesus, and people who read the forum began repeating his complaint to Catholic authorities. In the summer of 2008, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) voted to remove the sentence and replace it with a quote from the Epistle to the Romans: \\"To the Jewish people, whom God first chose to hear his word, belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ\\". Jewish leaders complained that the change was antisemitic. Monsignor Daniel Kutys said that the sentence was changed because of the confusion Sungenis' blog was generating, and also said that the change was made to skirt the issue rather address it directly. By 2008 his local bishop had instructed him to stop writing about Jews and to remove the name \\"Catholic\\" from his blog. In 2014 Sungenis stated that he would no longer write about Jewish issues that are political in nature and that he would remove content about Jews and Judaism, but he still maintained that the Jews as an ethnic group do not have a covenant with God. In 2014, during an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network about his geocentrism movie, he was asked about people describing him as denying the holocaust and being antisemitic. He said: \\"I had to make a public statement, and I made two separate statements -- 'I believe in the holocaust (you know), I love the Jewish people, I‚Äôm not an anti-semite.'\\" See video beginning at around 7:00 for the question, then his answer. Geocentrism According to Sungenis, he became interested in the pseudoscientific belief of geocentrism around 2002 after he read the book, Geocentricity by Gerardus D. Bouw. Sungenis became an advocate for the idea by 2006. He believes that the earth does not rotate and has offered $1,000 via his group, Catholic Apologetics International, to anyone who could prove that the Earth moves around the Sun. By 2011, he was the leader of a small group of conservative Roman Catholics who were advocating for the Roman Catholic Church to go back to the stance it took in condemning Galileo and which viewed the heliocentric model as part of a conspiracy to undermine the authority of the church in society more generally. He self-published a three-volume book called Galileo Was Wrong and runs a blog called Galileo Was Wrong in which he promotes these ideas. In 2014, Sungenis, along with Rick Delano, was an executive producer of The Principle, a documentary which advocates for his ideas about geocentrism. The movie features interviews with Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, Max Tegmark, Julian Barbour, and George F. R. Ellis, and was narrated by Kate Mulgrew, and was briefly in the news in 2014 when Mulgrew and the physicists said that the filmmakers did not honestly explain the purpose of their film to them. The release date of the film was October 24, 2014 when it was screened at the Marcus Addison Cinema in Addison, Illinois, according to the distributor Rocky Mountain Pictures. As of April 30, 2015 the film had grossed $89,543.

It was first serialized in Le Temps in 1885, and it was Verne's epic Mediterranean adventure. It employs many of the devices that had served well in his earlier novels: islands, cryptograms, surprise revelations of identity, technically advanced hardware and a solitary figure bent on revenge. Verne dedicated the novel to the memory of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, hoping to make Mathias Sandorf the Monte Cristo of Voyages Extraordinaires (The Extraordinary Voyages) series. Overview In Trieste, 1867, two petty criminals, Sarcany and Zirone, intercept a carrier pigeon. They find a ciphered message attached to its leg and uncover a plot to liberate Hungary from Habsburg-Austrian rule. The two meet with Silas Toronthal, a corrupt banker and form a plan to deliver the conspirators to the police in exchange for a rich reward. The three Hungarian conspirators, Count Mathias Sandorf, Stephen Bathory and Ladislas Zathmar (in their Hungarian form: S√°ndor M√°ty√°s, B√°thory Istv√°n and Szatm√°ri L√°szl√≥, respectively) are arrested and sentenced to death. They plot an escape, but are recaptured and killed one by one. Fifteen years later, the renowned physician Dr. Antekirtt (actually Sandorf who survived by faking his death) sets out to avenge his friends. Enlisting the aid of two French acrobats, Pescade and Matifou, he scours the Mediterranean in search of those who planned the betrayal. Rich beyond all imagination, wielding great power and master of an island fortress filled with advanced weaponry, Dr. Antekirtt will not rest until justice is done. The Wanderer's Tale: An Adventure Subgenre In the generation after Dumas, Jules Verne wrote a number of Wanderer adventures. Three of the most notable, Michael Strogoff, The Steam House (La Maison √† vapeur) and Mathias Sandorf, are set in three of Europe's great Empires: the Russian, the British (in India), and the Austrian. Their plots and themes have a good deal in common, as Jean Yves Tadie points out. Each one is about the empire's political troubles, each features a pursuer who is himself pursued, each has a trio of characters at its centre and each grants minor importance (compared with other Verne books) to machinery. (From Seven Types of Adventure: An Eniology of Major Genre by Martin Green Penn State Press). Background on the novel The fictional plot of Verne's book begins on May 18, 1867 - by which date preparations for the rising in Hungary are said to be almost complete. It is a matter of actual historical record - easily available to Verne in his research for the book - that on May 29, 1867, the Diet of Hungary ratified the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, under which the Hungarians gained a very considerable autonomy but shelved their demand for complete independence from Austria. Though the compromise is not explicitly mentioned in the book, it is clear that the aim of Sandorf and his fellow conspirators is to avert this ratification, seize control of Buda (Pest, Buda and √ìbuda was unified in 1873) and other major Hungarian cities, and get the Diet to declare instead a complete Hungarian independence - gambling that Austria, enfeebled by its recent defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, would have no choice but to accept this fait accompli. (If successful, such a move would have substantially changed later European history, up to the outbreak of World War I). The conduct of the Austrian authorities, once the conspiracy is discovered, can also be seen against the same background: The Austrians move in complete secrecy to arrest, court-martial and swiftly execute the radical Hungarians, while cementing the deal with their more amendable compatriots in the glare of publicity. Verne's readers in 1885 could know, even before reading of the police arresting Sandorf and his friends, that the conspiracy would fail, that the moderate Hungarians' compromise with Austria would go ahead and that in fact Hungarians would prove fairly content with it. Verne claimed that Sandorf was modeled on his publisher. Like Hetzel, a former exile, Sandorf has fervent patriotism and a high moral sense. Dr Antekirtt is a mixture of Hetzel and Bixio, one of the publisher's friends. Others see similarities with Hungarian freedom fighter Lajos Kossuth (who, like Sandorf, remained unreconciled to the compromise) and Austrian prince Ludwig Salvator. The action moves from Trieste down the Adriatic coast, to Sicily and the shores of North Africa. \\"I wish my readers to learn everything they should know about the Mediterranean,\\" Verne wrote Hetzel,\\" which is why the action transports them to twenty different places\\" (Simon Vierne, Jules Verne, Paris Ballard 1986). Several of the settings come from Verne's own travels, a rescue during a storm off Malta and visits to Catania and Etna. Verne researched the Italian landscape by rereading some of Stendhal's works notably Promenades in Rome and The Charterhouse of Parma. Verne may have first heard about the Foiba beneath Pisino castle in Charles Yriarte‚Äôs works Les Bords de l'Adriatique (The Ports of the Adriatic) - (Hachette, Paris 1878) and Trieste e l'Istria (Trieste and Istria) - (Hachette, Paris 1875). Yriatre described the old castle as well as his trip down into the gorge. He also mentioned an experiment by a young nobleman, Count Esdorff, to find the end of the underground river. Unfortunately the count's boat never made it out of the cave. The first edition was dedicated to Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. His son was so moved by the love expressed in the dedication that he wrote a letter to Verne which said 'I've been loving you for so long that I feel like your brother', and admitted that in literature Verne is Dumas' son more than he himself. The steam yacht of doctor Antekirtt, Savarena, is a true portrait of Verne's own steam yacht which he bought from the eccentric millionaire marquis de Pr√©aulx for 60,000 F. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations Bolossy Kiralfy's 1888 theatrical adaptation Mathias Sandorf was performed as a five-act play in Paris in the 1880s. It even played the Boston theatre in the fall of 1888 as well as at Niblo's Garden in New York in October 1888. There have also been three screen adaptations of Mathias Sandorf. The first Mathias Sandorf was made in 1921 and directed by Henri Fescourt. It starred Yvette Andr√©yor, Romuald Joub√©, Jean Toulout. During the 1920s Fescourt was one of the most successful directors working for Cineroman, and Mathias Sandorf, Les Gransa and Mandarin were among his most popular works. In 1963 Georges Lampin directed another version Mathias Sandorf starring Louis Jourdan, Francisco Rabal, Renaud Mary and Serena Vergano. The most recent version was a Television miniseries made for French television in 1979.1979 TV miniseries IMDb Directed by Jean-Pierre Decourt it starred Hungarian actor Istvan Bujtor as Mathias Sandorf, Ivan Desny as Zathmar, and also Amadeus August, Claude Giraud, Monika Peitsch, Sissy H√∂fferer and Jacques Breuer.

The island was formerly known in its indigenous name of Mat- te-wan-ye, and as Pinchgut Island. The site contains time gun, navigational aids and tide gauge facilities. Correctional and military facilities were designed by George Barney and built from 1840 to 1862 by William Randle. The property is owned by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. In 1978 the former fortress was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate, and is currently used as a national park, nature reserve, tourist facility, and as a function space. History Prior to European settlement, the island had the Eora name Mat-te- wan-ye (sometimes Mallee‚Äôwonya). =Prison= After the First Fleet arrived in 1788, Governor Phillip and his advocate-general used the name \\"Rock Island\\". In 1788, a convict named Thomas Hill was sentenced to a week on bread and water in irons there. The island came to be known as \\"Pinchgut\\".Decisions of the Superior Courts of New South Wales, 1788-1899 R. v. Hill [1788 NSWKR 2; [1788] NSWSupC 2. Accessed 7 January 2015. Once a high or higher sandstone islet, the rock was levelled by convicts under the command of Captain George Barney, the civil engineer for the colony, who quarried it for sandstone to construct nearby Circular Quay. In late 1796 the Governor had installed a gibbet on Pinchgut. A convict to be hanged and then gibbeted there was Francis Morgan. In 1793, the British transported him to New South Wales for life as punishment for a murder. The authorities in NSW executed Morgan for bashing Simon Raven to death in Sydney on 18 October 1796.Australia Today‚ÄîFort Denison (Pinchgut): A Relic of Early Sydney at (Education Notes) Australian Screen website. Accessed 27 March 2013. On 30 November 1796, Morgan was hanged; following his execution, his body was hung in chains (gibbeting) on Pinchgut. His skeleton was still hanging there four years after his execution. He said to the hangman that the only thing worth mentioning was the superb view of the harbour from his high elevation, and that he was sure there were no waters the world over to compare with it for beauty. =Military fortress= In 1839, two American warships entered the harbour at night and circled Pinchgut Island. Concern with the threat of foreign attack caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences. Barney, who had earlier reported that Sydney's defences were inadequate, recommended that the government establish a fort on Pinchgut Island to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Fortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. Construction resumed in 1855 because of fear of a Russian naval attack during the Crimean War, and was completed on 14 November 1857. The newly built fort then took its current name from Sir William Thomas Denison, the Governor of New South Wales from 1855 to 1861. The fortress features a distinctive Martello tower, the only one ever built in Australia and the last one ever constructed in the British Empire. It was constructed using of sandstone from nearby Kurraba Point, Neutral Bay. The tower's walls are between thick at the base and thick at the top. However, developments in artillery rendered the fort largely obsolete by the time it was completed. The tower itself had quarters for a garrison of 24 soldiers and one officer. Fort Denison's armament included three muzzle loaders in the tower, two guns, one on a 360-degree traverse on the top of the tower and one in a bastion at the other end of the island, and twelve cannons in a battery between the base of the tower and the flanking bastion. Eventually all the guns were removed, except for the three muzzle- loading cannons in the gun room in the tower, which were installed before construction was complete. The passages within the tower are too narrow to permit these to be removed. However, from the beginning the three cannons were of limited utility. The embrasures for the cannons were too small to use the guns effectively and by the time a cannon was loaded the ship it was to fire on would have sailed past. Lastly, the guns' recoil was too powerful for the small room. In 1906, a saluting gun (pictured below) was transferred from Dawes Point to Fort Denison. In 1913 a lighthouse beacon built in Birmingham, England, and shipped to Sydney, replaced the gun on the roof of the tower. The light is called Fort Denison Light, which is still in use. Fort Denison circa 1930 In May 1942, three Japanese two-man midget-submarines attacked Sydney Harbour. When the US Navy cruiser fired on the Japanese, some of its shells hit Fort Denison, causing the tower minor damage which remains visible. Explosive prank In October 1900, as the Boer war raged in Africa, the White Star Line ship sailed into Sydney Harbour and dropped anchor in Neutral Bay. One night, the fourth officer, Charles Lightoller and two shipmates rowed to Fort Denison and climbed the tower with a plan to fool locals into believing a Boer raiding party was attacking Sydney. They hoisted a makeshift Boer flag on the lightning conductor and fired a harmless wad of cotton waste from one of the 8-inch cannons. The blast shattered a few of the fort's windows but caused no other damage. Lightoller was never apprehended but confessed to his company's superiors and related the whole story in an autobiography. He was transferred to the Atlantic route and went on to be the second officer of the and the most senior officer to survive the 1912 sinking of the ship. He was a key witness at both the British and American inquiries into the disaster. Current use =Recent restorative works= Since 1992, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages the site, has spent around A$2m conserving and upgrading the facilities. EnergyAustralia also made a significant contribution for the work via the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife. Following publication of a conservation plan, further renovation commenced in 1999 and was completed in 2001. The conservation and adaptive re- use of the island was awarded the NSW Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Conservation Award; a Commendation in the National RAIA Awards; and a National Trust Heritage Award in 2001. Increased harbour traffic has already destroyed the slipway. Furthermore, the porous sandstone drinks in the salt right down to the fort's foundations. In 2007 the government announced a $1.5 million rescue package. Fort Dennison is now home to more than 100 birds. Viewing west from the southern bastion Fort Denison is now a museum, tourist attraction, restaurant, and popular location for wedding receptions and corporate events. The tourist facility contains an exhibition of the island's history from Aboriginal times. Access to Fort Denison is via a ferry that departs Wharf 6 at Circular Quay every 45 minutes, 7 days a week. The price of the ferry ticket includes the landing fee. Guided tours of the island, including the Martello tower are at an additional cost. NSW National Parks & Wildlife Services conducts the tours. In 2004 the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service restored the lighthouse beacon, which is still in use and supports operation of a Harbour Navigational Facility, with tide gauge, navigation channel markers, foghorn and beacon, established in the mid-19th century. The Bureau of Meteorology operates a weather facility from the island and publishes observations at half-hourly intervals on its website. The custom of firing a gun daily at 1pm began in 1906 to enable sailors to set their ship's chronometers correctly. The daily gun continued until World War II when the authorities stopped it for fear of alarming residents. The practice recommenced in 1986. =Restaurant on the Island= The Fort Denison Restaurant was opened on the island in 2006, although the restaurant lease expired in June 2017 and is yet to be renewed. Throughout the years since it has been voted in the top five waterfront restaurants worldwide by the Sydney Morning Herald, and was open for lunch 7 days a week year round, dinners on a Sunday, and for special events and occasions which can be found on their website. Bookings for major occasions, such as New Year's Eve, were coveted. =Popular culture= Fort Denison was the location of the 1959 film The Siege of Pinchgut, released in the United States as Four Desperate Men. Directed by Harry Watt, written by Jon Cleary and starring Aldo Ray, the production was the final Australian film of the British-based Ealing Studios. The island also featured as the base of operations for Neville Savage in the sixth episode of the Australian children's television show Mission Top Secret. Fort Denison was often seen in the television series Water Rats. One episode in season two of the show, End of the Line, featured a party on the island.  Description  Fort Denison on Sydney Harbour is within the visual catchment of the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Royal Botanic Garden and the Sydney Harbour Naval Precinct.NPWS, 2016 Fort Denison is the only Sydney Harbour island which is no longer described as an island. Even Garden Island, now visually part of the mainland (and anything but a garden) is still known as an island. The island known as Mat-te-wan-ye (small rocky island) to Aborigines and Rock Island to the first settlers, is now popularly known as Fort Denison and viewed as a built artefact rather than an island. From a distance no evidence of its original island character is apparent, except perhaps scattered rocks at low tide. However, on close inspection the sandstone bedrock visible below the south west battery reveals part of the rock of the island, particularly when combined with the pictorial evidence provided by drawings such as that by Barrington in 1802. ;The Fort The visual impact of the fort is a combination of the strong vertical mass of the Martello tower and the equally strong horizontal lines of the low barrack and battery buildings. The two distinct building forms reflects the history of the staged Fort construction; which progressed from the original horizontal form of the battery, and later construction of the barracks and Martello tower. The tower, which only lost its dominant role in marking the water entrance to the city with the construction of the Sydney Opera House, was built with an open gun platform (terreplein) which surmounted two internal levels. A section through the tower, shows the navigational light which replaced the upper cannon in 1913. The lower internal level contained rooms for the storage of gunpowder and provisions and the middle level still houses the three original cannons. Internal tower circulation is via a spiralling staircase that connects the three tower levels. External access to the tower is through a single external door from the upper terrace level battery and bastion. Three major elements comprise the strong horizontal section of the fort; the battery and bastion, the barracks and terrace. ;Gun Battery and Bastion: The outward facing defensive side of the fort known as the gun battery and bastion confronted incoming ships. It is constructed out of the island's sandstone bedrock. The battery consists of an open working area which services a series of nine gun placements and corresponding slanted firing openings which are equally positioned along the raised parapet wall of the battery. An underground water tank has been cut into the bedrock of the battery. The bastion located at the southern end of the battery was constructed to house a single cannon set behind a raised stone parapet. The cannon was located on a raised circular revolving mount to maximise the cannon's aim of fire. ;Wet Ditch and Breakwater: A wet ditch and breakwater formed by sandstone blocks separates the fort from the open harbour channel. Beyond this is a breakwater which surrounds the whole island which moderates the wave action against the stone fabric of the fort. ;Barrack: The main single storey building is the barrack, its eight chimneys indicate its original accommodation purpose. The barracks are built into cut back bedrock and contain a row of single rooms used for military bunk-style accommodation for the lower ranks as well as accommodation for two separate officers' quarters. A central breezeway and vault covered staircase allows access from the barracks and lower terraces to the upper terrace battery, bastion and Martello tower. The two end rooms adjoining the barracks, known as the Tide Gauge Room to the north and the West Room to the south, were constructed soon after the completion of the barracks. The loopholes, or angled openings, were designed to enable the defensive fire whilst defending against enemy attack. ;Terrace: The lower north west facing terrace is constructed on the same level as the barracks. It was probably built on rubble fill which is contained by a low stone wall. The terrace is open and not defensive in nature, as it faces away from the open sea and potential attack. It currently has a bitumen surface and several small planted garden beds. Garden beds were constructed on this terrace during the 20th century as part of the domestication of the fort by the Sydney Harbour Trust and later Maritime Services Board caretakers. Two sewerage treatment units which service the toilets are concealed in the garden beds at either end of the barracks.Fort Denison Conservation Plan 1999 NPWS ;Plantings: A Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) planted in one raised garden bed on the terrace's western side and a fruiting fig tree (Ficus carica cv.) at the south-west base of the Martello Tower are the only trees on Fort Denison.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 8/8/2016 An external cannon is on the Eastern Terrace. A tall flag pole with side spars runs three permanently flown flags on this terrace. = Condition = As at 26 May 2014, the physical condition is excellent. Archaeological potential is high. Published material on such towers in the English speaking world suggests that this may well be the most intact tower.Kerr 1986:48 = Modifications and dates = The following modifications have been made to Fort Denison: *1840-1842 - construction of battery *1856-1858 - construction of battery, barrack and tower and bastion *1858-1862 - construction of terrace, west room and tide gauge room *1917 - construction of slipway  Heritage listing  Fort Denison was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 . Tide gauge Tides have been measured at Fort Denison since 1857 on completion of the fort, initially using a bench mark cut into the stonework of the Martello Tower. From 1867 successive instruments were used as tide measuring technology developed.Refer the interpretive panel installed in the tide room at Fort Denison. (The measurements since 1886 are graphed by NOAA). The Fort Denison photographs below show float activated tide gauge instruments in a cabinet and the system's stilling well. A wire connected to the upper drum mechanism passes out through the bottom right of the cabinet and runs over a pulley to drop down to the float system in the large pipe in the well. This system is now obsolete at Fort Denison but maintained as a museum exhibit. To the right of the large pipe in the well is an enclosed pipe which rises to the active modern system. Tide heights and times at Fort Denison are the primary base referent for published tide information for other places in the state of New South Wales.

They originally spoke the Kharia language, which belong to Austroasiatic languages. They are sub-divided into three groups known as the Hill Kharia, Delki Kharia and the Dudh Kharia. Amongst them, the Dudh Kharia is the advanced and educated ethnic community. History According to linguist Paul Sidwell, Munda languages arrived on the coast of Odisha from Southeast Asia about 4000-3500 years ago.Sidwell, Paul. 2018. Austroasiatic Studies: state of the art in 2018. Presentation at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, 22 May 2018. The Austroasiatic language speaker spread from Southeast Asia and mixed extensively with local Indian populations. Social divisions The Kharia comprise three tribes, the Dudh Kharia, Dhelki Kharia, and Hill Kharia.. The first two speak an Austroasiatic language, Kharia, but the Hill Kharia have switched to an Indo-Aryan language, Kharia Thar. There has not been any language development efforts made for Kharia Tar. The Dudh Kharia and Dhelki Kharia formed together one compact tribe. These Kharia people were attacked by an Ahir chief and then moved on to the Chota Nagpur Plateau. In Odisha, the Hill Kharia are mainly found in Jashipur and Karanjia Blocks of Mayurbhanj district. A few villages are also found in Morada block. In Jharkhand, they are concentrated in East Singhbhum, Gumla, Simdega districts. Though widely found in this district, Musabani, Dumaria and Chakulia Blocks are the blocks where they live in large numbers. And in West Bengal, they are in West Midnapur, Bankura and Purulia districts. The majority are in Purulia. The Hill Kharia are also called Pahari (meaning ‚ÄúHill‚Äù) Kharia, Savara/Sabar, Kheria, Erenga, or Pahar. Outsiders call them Kharia but they call themselves as Sabar. They are called ‚ÄúPahari (Hill) Kharia‚Äù because they live in the midst of forest and depend upon forest produces. There are several gotras (clans) among the Hill Kharia such as Golgo, Bhunia, Sandi, Gidi, Dehuri, Pichria, Nago, Tolong, Suya, Dhar, Tesa, Kotal, Kharmoi, Digar, Laha, Saddar, Sikari, Rai, Dungdung, Bilung, Kiro, Kerketta, Soreng, Kullu, Baa, Tete, Dolai, Sal, Alkosi and Khiladi. Golgo seems to be dominant one because in every village that clan is spelt out first whenever their clans were asked. Distribution They mainly inhabit Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal, Maharashtra. In Tripura . Few families can be found in Assam and Andaman islands. According to 1981 census, their population in Bihar is 141,771, in Odisha it is 144,178, and in Madhya Pradesh it is 6892. Culture =Lifestyle= The Kharia who were under zamindars during British rule are now land owning farmers in independent India. All Kharia speak their traditional dialect. The Language spoken by them is a part of the Munda Languages, which are part of the Austroasiatic languages. They are very close to the nature and culture of the tribe is influenced by its ecological and cultural surroundings. Roadside gods of the Hill Kharia Tribe =Dress= The Hill Kharia have preserved their traditional dress pattern and rest of the Kharia have been influenced by the modern contacts and changed their dressing style. Traditionally, they wear Dhoti called Bhagwan. women wear saree falling up to the ankles. A part of the saree covers their bosom. The traditional dress is nowadays going out of use. Both men and women wear ornaments generally made of Brass, Nickel, Aluminium, Silver and rarely of Gold. Dudh Kharia women prefer Gold ornaments. =Economy= Different levels of economic developments on sectional basis exist among Kharia. The Hill Kharia is a food gathering, hunting and labourer community. The Dhelkis are agricultural labourers and agriculturalists, while Dudh Kharia are exclusively agriculturists in their primary economy. Kharia people are skilled in cottage industries. =Religion= According to the 2011 Census on Kharias of Odisha, the majority, 60.4% follows Hinduism, followed by 39.1% Christians. Minor populations follow Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and other religions. =Dances= Kharia are said to be the great dancers. Youth of both sexes dance together. sometimes they form two groups each of males and females and sing one after the other. It is like conversion is going on between boys and girls in the form of the song. The following dance patterns are prevalent among Kharias- Hario, Kinbhar, Halka, Kudhing and Jadhura.

As the newly renamed City of New York and surrounding areas developed, there was a growing independent feeling among some, but the area was decidedly split in its loyalties. The site of modern New York City was the theater of the New York Campaign, a series of major battles in the early American Revolutionary War. After that, the city was under British occupation until the end of the war and was the last port British ships evacuated in 1783.  Early English period  Fur was one reason for having a town here Settlers of New Amsterdam blended into new English colony. The Rapalje Children, 1768, children of trader of early New Amsterdam descent The English had renamed the colony the Province of New York, after the king's brother James, Duke of York and on June 12, 1665, appointed Thomas Willett the first of the Mayors of New York. The city grew northward and remained the largest and most important city in the Province of New York, becoming the third largest in the British Empire after London and Philadelphia. The Dutch regained the colony briefly in 1673, then finally lost it permanently to the English in 1674 after the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Leisler's Rebellion, an uprising in which militia captain Jacob Leisler seized control of lower New York from 1689 to 1691, occurred in the midst of England's \\"Glorious Revolution\\". It reflected colonial resentment against King James II, who in the 1680s decreed the formation of the provinces of New York, New Jersey and the Dominion of New England as royal colonies, with New York City designated as the capital. Royal authority was restored in 1691 by English troops sent by James' successor, William III. New York was cosmopolitan from the beginning, established and governed largely as a strategic trading post. One visitor during the early revolutionary period wrote that \\"the inhabitants are in general brisk and lively,\\" the women were \\"handsome,\\" he recorded‚Äîas did others new to the city‚Äîthough, he added, \\"it rather hurts a European eye to see so many Negro slaves upon the streets.\\" There were numerous marriages of people from different ethnic groups. \\"Joyce Goodfriend's study of colonial New York City, for instance, suggests that many interracial marriages occurred more because of a lack of opportunity to marry within their own group than a desire to marry outside it. ...over 60% of Englishmen in the New York capital in the late 17th century married women of non-English origins.\\" However, by the 1730s over three fourths of the Dutch men and women still married within their own groups, though by this point there was a generation of children of mixed European ancestry.Daily Life in the Colonial City - Krawczynaski Freedom of worship was part of the city's foundation, and the trial for libel in 1735 of John Peter Zenger, editor of the New-York Weekly Journal established the principle of freedom of the press in the British colonies. Sephardic Jews expelled from Dutch Brazil after Portuguese recapture, were welcome in New York when the governor realized their value and gave them exemptions from restrictions on Jews. The New York Slave Insurrection of 1741 raised accusations of arson and conspiracy. Many slaves were executed on unclear charges.  Revolution  Trinity Church on Wall Street is visible in the distance. The city was the base for British operations in the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War) from 1754‚Äì1763. That conflict united the colonies for the first time in common defense and moreover eliminated the main military threat that the colonists had relied upon Britain to defend them from. When two years after the conclusion of that war in 1765, the British Parliament imposed a Stamp Act to augment local expenditures for defending the colonies, delegates from nine colonies met for the Stamp Act Congress, at what would later be known as Federal Hall in Manhattan, to protest. The Sons of Liberty, a secret and sometimes violent patriot group, formed chapters in New York and other cities and frightened the royal officials. The \\"Sons\\" engaged in a running conflict with British authority in the city over the raising of liberty poles in prominent public locations (see Battle of Golden Hill), from the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766 until rebel control of the city in 1775. The poles, often when a signal device such as a red cap was placed atop the pole, served as rallying points for public assemblies to protest against the colonial government. The city was the main location of organized political resistance in the form of the Committee of Sixty and then later the New York Provincial Congress. Following the first reading of the Declaration of Independence, the statue of King George III in Bowling Green was torn down and melted into musket balls. The city, however, was a hotbed of Royal fervor and probably held a larger proportion of Tories than any other place in the colonies before hostilities‚Äîthough likely still short of a majority. General George Washington and his troops moved in to defend Manhattan and New York Harbor in 1776. Prior to roughly one-third of New York City's population fleeing the expected combat, the Continental Army came upon a grand city of wealth, a bustling center of commerce, shipbuilding and maritime trade. The city had been built for seafaring transit and trade, and Manhattan's only connection to the mainland was the narrow, wooden King's bridge over the Harlem River, nearly 11 miles north of the city and ferries across the North (Hudson's) River. Most of the population of 20,000 was crowded into an area of less than a square mile near the East River wharves and the New York Harbor. The city's traders, stock brokers, and mariners brought with them great wealth. Henry Knox wrote his wife admiring New Yorkers' \\"magnificent\\" horse carriages and fine furniture, but condemning their \\"want of principle,\\" \\"pride and conceit,\\" \\"profaneness,\\" and \\"insufferable\\" Toryism. Manhattan's free-wheeling ways did create an environment of loose tongues and loose women. A young Presbyterian chaplain \\"worried what the consequences might be to the American cause of so many of all ranks so habitually taking the name of the Lord in vain.\\" \\"But alas, swearing abounds, all classes swear,\\" he lamented. The abundance of prostitutes in New York City‚Äîan estimated at 500 women plying \\"their trade\\" in 1776‚Äîwas particularly distressing for many of the Continental soldiers of a Puritan bent, George Washington included. From Lieutenant Isaac Bangs of Massachusetts comes one of the most complete accounts of prostitution in revolutionary America; he had a medical degree from Harvard and took it upon himself to tour the brothel district to inspect the health conditions of the neighborhood and investigate the seedy side of the city that so worried General Washington. He was absolutely appalled by the women of the bawdy houses, who, he thought, \\"nothing could exceed them in impudence and immodesty,\\" but \\"the more I became acquainted with them, the more they excelled in their brutality.\\" April 22, barely a week after the Continental Army arrived in the city, two soldiers were found dead hidden in a bordello, one corpse \\"castrated in a barbarous manner,\\" Bangs reported. Soldiers went on a rampage in the brothel district \\"in furious retaliation.\\" General Washington condemned all such \\"riotous behavior\\" and ordered military patrols in the district, a strict curfew, and other restrictions. General Washington understood the crucial strategic importance of New York and its waterways to the war effort, but \\"...had seen enough of New York on prior visits to dislike and distrust the city as the most sinful place in America, a not uncommon view.\\" American Revolutionary War General Washington correctly surmised that after their defeat at the Siege of Boston, the British strategy would be to divide the colonies by capturing the strategic port and waterways of New York City. He then began to fortify the city and took personal command of the Continental Army at New York in the summer of 1776. Toppling the statue of the King in New York City Five battles comprising the New York Campaign were fought around the city limits in late 1776, beginning with the Battle of Long Island in Brooklyn on August 27‚Äîthe largest battle of the entire war. A quarter of the city structures were destroyed in the Great Fire on September 21, a few days after the British Landing at Kip's Bay and the Battle of Harlem Heights - the lone American victory in this part of the campaign, but doing much to improve morale and keep the army together. Following the highly suspicious fire, British authorities apprehended dozens of people for questioning, including Nathan Hale, who was executed a day later for unrelated charges of espionage. The British conquest of Manhattan was completed with the fall of Fort Washington and the evacuation of Fort Lee (on the Hudson River western shore in New Jersey) on November 16, 1776, and thereafter they held the city without challenge until 1783. Major General James Robertson, commandant in charge of the city confiscated houses of rebels who had left and distributed them to British officers. Manhattan and environs, late in the war Early British military success resulted in military occupation of the city, and the exodus of any remaining Patriots combined with a large influx of Loyalist refugees from throughout the former colonies, making the city solidly Loyalist for the remainder of the British occupation. The city became the British political and military center of operations for the rest of the conflict. For this purpose the map now known as the British Headquarters Map was drawn in 1782, the best map of Manhattan Island's largely natural, unengineered condition.The Mannahatta Project British Headquarters Map of Manhattan Island The city's status as the British nexus made it the center of attention for Washington's intelligence network. American prisoners were held under deliberately inhumane conditions on rotting British prison ships in nearby Wallabout Bay on the East River between New York and Brooklyn (future Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park) for much of the war. The policy of making prison conditions unbearable was ostensibly to encourage the soldiers to volunteer to join the British navy as an alternative. More American soldiers and sailors died on these ships from deliberate neglect than in every battle of the Revolution, combined. The anniversary of Evacuation Day, in which the last British troops and many Tory supporters and collaborators departed in November 1783, was long celebrated in New York. Social upheaval When the British left in 1783, they took along many loyalists including prominent businessmen, lawyers, financiers and clergymen. Edward Countryman, \\"The uses of capital in revolutionary America: the case of the New York loyalist merchants.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1992): 3-28 in JSTOR The Anglican Church had been especially powerful in the colonial era, and it began to lose much of its influence in the area as many prominent members departed. It lost its funding from the British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, was soon after disestablished by the state in 1784, and therefore lost control of King's College (now Columbia University). The city was more democratic and much more open to ambitious entrepreneurs from middle-class and poor backgrounds.Kyle T.

It started by a coordinated attack on Sweden by the coalition in 1700, and ended 1721 with the conclusion of the Treaty of Nystad, and the Stockholm Treaties. As a result of the war, Russia supplanted Sweden as the dominant power on the shores of the Baltic Sea, becoming a major player in European politics. Setting the stage for war Between 1561 and 1658, Sweden fought a series of wars in the Baltic, establishing an empire. During this period Sweden had occupied the Danish provinces of Sk√•ne, Blekinge and Halland and the Norwegian provinces of J√§mtland, H√§rjedalen, Tr√∏ndelag and Bohusl√§n. For Denmark, even more than the loss of territory, the continuous Swedish interference in Holstein (supporting claims for lands in Danish held Schleswig) was a major bone of contention. In the late 1690s Russia, who had also lost territory to Sweden, allied with Denmark‚ÄìNorway, together with the duke of Saxony, who expected a reconquest of territory lost by his kingdom, Poland, to strengthen his domestic position. When the young Charles XII ascended Sweden's throne in 1697, the opportunity appeared ripe for recapturing lost territory. Battle of Narva Victory at Narva (Gustaf Cederstr√∂m, 1905) In 1700 the three powers attacked and for Sweden the difficulty of a three front war had to be faced. No one expected what followed. The early part of the war consisted of a continual string of Swedish victories under Charles XII. Denmark was defeated in the summer of 1700 and withdrew until 1709. Russia suffered a defeat in the Battle of Narva in November, but regained the offensive and the city of St. Petersburg was founded between 1703 and 1707. Then Charles XII defeated Augustus the Strong in 1706-07, temporarily deposing him from the Polish throne. =In Norway= Frederick IV of Denmark distrusted the nobility and gentry and surrounded himself with ministers and advisers of humble origin. The one exception was the king's half-brother, Ulrich Christian Gyldenl√∏ve, who at the age of 24 was General-Admiral and Commander in Chief of the Navy. Frederick toured Norway in 1704 to assess the condition of his army and his second kingdom. In the morning, at the noon stop, and in the evenings the king held audiences with all who wanted to speak to him, from wealthy landowners to lowly peasants.  Battle of Poltava Battle of Poltava (Pierre-Denis Martin, 1726) Charles XII was defeated by Peter in the Battle of Poltava (located in modern day Ukraine) in June 1709, and his army was virtually annihilated. He fled to the Ottoman Empire and spent five years in exile there. On the Western Front Capture of Helsingborg (Claus Moinichen. 1688) In November 1709 Denmark invaded Sk√•ne and Count Magnus Stenbock, charged with the defense of Sweden, succeeded in defeating Denmark at the Battle of Helsingborg in 1710. Meanwhile Russia captured Livonia and Estonia in the east. Despite another Swedish victory over the Danes at Gadebusch in December 1712, Stenbock‚Äôs army was forced to surrender of the fortress of T√∂nning in May 1713. =In Norway= During September 1709 Norwegian forces were ordered to mobilise, and by the end of October 6,000 men were assembled on the Swedish border at Svinesund while 1,500 were congregated near the border at Kongsvinger. In August, 1710 Baron Waldemar L√∏vendal returned in Norway as Governor and commander of a country much drained in resources by the wars of the past century. The governor threw himself into building the civil and military leadership in the country just a short march from Sweden. When he left Norway in 1712, he had instituted reforms that served to create a civil service in Norway, and proceeded to document state activities to a degree never before seen in Norway, as well as being a strong military leader. Baron L√∏vendal raised and equipped a Norwegian Army to invade and recapture the former Norwegian province of Bohusl√§n under the leadership of General-Lieutenant Caspar Herman Hausmann. In parallel he proposed a strong fleet to provide protection and transportation to seaward, and Frederick IV committed to providing such a force under Vice Admiral Sehested in June 1711. In August, the Norwegian army marched into Bohusl√§n, warmly welcomed by their former countrymen. But by late summer the fleet Vice Admiral Sehested‚Äôs fleet had not appeared offshore, having been ordered by Frederick IV to return to Baltic waters. Without naval support, the Norwegian Army was forced to return to Norway. In the autumn of 1711 the plague struck Denmark, and Copenhagen alone lost 70,000 occupants. 1712 was a disappointing year in Norway, as Frederick IV directed L√∏vendal not to use the Norwegian Army in offensive actions, reserving it for defense and for supplementing Danish troops elsewhere. General Hausmann was named head of all Norway‚Äôs land and sea defenses. =Public rebellion= The taxations that followed from warfare and the forced mobilization of Norwegian farm boys led to uprising and riots in some parts of Norway. Among the most known cases are the farmer's tax rebellion in 1713 (Hallingdal), and a soldier's strike in 1720 (Telemark). In 1713, two leading farmers in Hallingdal spoke against the Danish authorities, demanding an end to war taxation, because the farmers could not bear the costs. Eventually, the tax collectors found doors shut all over the region, and had to call in a public meeting. The two leaders were tried and sentenced to labour in the fortress of Akershus. One of them, Elling Villand, who also was sentenced to give away his farm, was freed less than half a year later, and sat on his farm until he died. In Telemark, Olav Olavsson Hovdejord a local sheriff and leading farmer stood up against the German captain in 1720, demanding an end to the forced mobilization of farmer's sons. At this point, Norwegians were tired of the war. The case was tried in favour of the farmer, Olav Hovdejord, and the captain was called back to Denmark for his coarse behaviour. He had at this point chopped Olav's right hand off for interfering. The Fall of Stralsund Only the firmness of the Chancellor, Count Arvid Horn, held Sweden in the war until Charles finally returned from the Ottoman Empire, arriving in Swedish held Stralsund in November 1714 on the south shore of the Baltic. Charles was by now at war with most of Northern Europe, and Stralsund was doomed. Charles remained there until December, 1715, escaping only days before Stralsund fell. By this point, Charles was considered mad by many, as he would not consider peace and the price Sweden had paid was already dear, with no hope in sight. All of Sweden‚Äôs Baltic and German possessions were lost. The Norwegian Campaigns =The 1716 Campaign in Norway= Not one to consider peace, upon his return to Sweden Charles began gathering materials and men for another campaign, this time against Copenhagen, attacking across the frozen √òresund from Sk√•ne. But the ice went out before he could launch his attack, so he redirected his focus. Charles XII chose then to invade Norway through Bohusl√§n. Getting intelligence of this intent, General Caspar Herman Hausmann warned Frederick IV, who didn‚Äôt believe the General and dismissed him summarily. The Norwegian Army had been weakened in early 1716 by withdrawal of 5000 of the best troops to support the defense of Denmark; further Norwegian Commander-in-Chief Barthold Heinrich von L√ºtzow was not famous as a visionary leader. When rumors reached Christiania that Charles XII was preparing to invade, all remaining troops in √òsterdal and Gudbrandsdal were ordered to the border at Halden and Fredrikstad. The Norwegians anticipated attack from Sweden might occur at Kongsvinger, Basmo or Halden. It was Basmo where Charles XII struck, crossing the border and establishing his headquarters at the H√∏land parsonage on March 8, 1716. The Norwegian commander of the district did not lack courage, and without waiting for his full forces to assemble, he attacked Charles‚Äô superior forces with only 200 dragoons, fighting valiantly but suffered serious losses including his own capture. Upon hearing of this defeat, General L√ºtzow withdrew his forward troops and established a defensive position at Christiania. The Swedish forces advanced and, leaving a greatly strengthened garrison in Akershus fortress at Christiania, on March 19 L√ºtzow withdrew to Bragernes in Drammen. The Norwegian scorched earth policy and guerrilla raid interdiction of supply chains by the residents of Bohusl√§n denied Charles of supplies. Further, the Norwegian fortresses behind his lines threatened his retreat if he became seriously weakened in combat. Charles took the city of Christiania, but without heavy siege artillery was unable to take Akershus Fortress. After a brief occupation of Christiania, Charles retraced his steps to the Norwegian fortresses in south-eastern Norway with the objective of capturing them, particularly Fredriksten. This would remove the threat at his back, and they were to serve as the base for his offensive later that year, as well as capture of the harbours at mouth of the Glomma river, which would allow him to land the necessary provisions for a successful siege of Akershus. Charles' troops attempted to take Fredriksten by storm on July 4. His troops took the town after fierce fighting, but the citizens set fire to their homes and Charles, unable to take the fortress, was forced to retreat and await the arrival of heavy guns in the aftermath of the Battle of Dynekilen. Commodore Johan Vibe of the Dano-Norwegian fleet off Bohusl√§n was charged with interdicting supplies. Peter Wessel, a Norwegian captain serving in the fleet had distinguished himself in numerous engagements off the coast of Swedish Pomerania. In the beginning of 1716 he was ennobled by Frederick IV under the name of Tordenskiold. Captain Peter Wessel Tordenskiold led a daring cutting- out raid at Dynekil Fjord in Bohusl√§n which captured or destroyed the entire Swedish transport fleet, and, more importantly, the Swedish supplies at Dynekilen. Running low on supplies, Charles retreated hastily across the Svinesund and burned his bridges behind him. By July 12, not a Swedish soldier remained in Norway. For this feat, Frederick IV promoted Tordenskiold to Commodore. In October 1716 Commodore Tordenskjold was given charge of a North Sea Squadron and placed at the head of Norway‚Äôs Sea Force over the protests of Baron Wedel, Norway‚Äôs new General in Chief. =The 1717 Norwegian Hiatus= Even with his defeat, Charles still planned to redeem himself by a Norwegian invasion. 1717 became a year of rebuilding for both sides. Action was limited to unsuccessful attacks by Commodore Tordenskjold's squadron on Gothenburg and Str√∂mstad. As a result of the failures, Commodore Tordenskjold was relieved of Command of the North Sea fleet. =The 1718 Campaign in Norway= Commodore Tordenskjold was reassigned to the Baltic Fleet, in command of the 64-gun ship of the line, Ebenezer. The North Sea fleet under Rear Admiral Andreas Rosenpalm pursued an unaggressive patrol strategy along the Bohusl√§n coast. With the Danish fleet diverted to the Baltic and the lightening of patrols from the North Sea fleet, throughout the summer of 1718, steady streams of supplies were carried up through the Bohusl√§n skerries and to the Norwegian border. Armaments emphasized the heavy guns, ammunition and supplies that would be necessary to take the strong border fortresses at Fredriksten in Fredrikshald. In the Autumn of 1718 Charles again attacked Norway. He was killed while inspecting the front trenches of the siege-works against Fredriksten. This precipitated an immediate retreat of his war-weary forces back to Sweden, effectively terminating the Norwegian campaigns. Conclusion The war was finally concluded in 1721. Sweden had lost almost all of her overseas holdings gained in the 17th century, and was no longer a major power. Russia took the Baltic territories, and from then on was the major power in the east. The balance of power between Sweden and Denmark- Norway was restored.

These deposits are also sometimes called volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. The density generally is 4500 kg/m3. They are predominantly stratiform accumulations of sulfide minerals that precipitate from hydrothermal fluids on or below the seafloor in a wide range of ancient and modern geological settings. In modern oceans they are synonymous with sulfurous plumes called black smokers. They occur within environments dominated by volcanic or volcanic derived (e.g., volcano- sedimentary) rocks, and the deposits are coeval and coincident with the formation of said volcanic rocks. As a class, they represent a significant source of the world's copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver ores, with cobalt, tin, barium, sulfur, selenium, manganese, cadmium, indium, bismuth, tellurium, gallium and germanium as co- or by-products. Volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits are forming today on the seafloor around undersea volcanoes along many mid ocean ridges, and within back-arc basins and forearc rifts. Mineral exploration companies are exploring for seafloor massive sulfide deposits; however, most exploration is concentrated in the search for land-based equivalents of these deposits. The close association with volcanic rocks and eruptive centers sets VMS deposits apart from similar ore deposit types which share similar source, transport and trap processes. Volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits are distinctive in that ore deposits are formed in close temporal association with submarine volcanism and are formed by hydrothermal circulation and exhalation of sulfides which are independent of sedimentary processes, which sets VMS deposits apart from sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposits. There is a subclass of VMS deposits, the volcanic- and sediment- hosted massive sulfide (VSHMS) deposits, that do share characteristics that are hybrid between the VMS and SEDEX deposits. Notable examples of this class include the deposits of the Bathurst Camp, New Brunswick, Canada (e.g., Brunswick #12); the deposits of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, Portugal and Spain, and the Wolverine deposit, Yukon, Canada.  Genetic model  * The source of metal and sulfur in VMS deposits is a combination of incompatible elements which are leached from the volcanic pile in the sub-seafloor hydrothermal alteration zone by hydrothermal circulation. Hydrothermal circulation is generally considered to be driven via heat in the crust often related to deep- seated gabbro intrusions. * Transport of metals occurs via convection of hydrothermal fluids, the heat for this supplied by the magma chamber which sits below the volcanic edifice. Cool ocean water is drawn into the hydrothermal zone and is heated by the volcanic rock and is then expelled into the ocean, the process enriching the hydrothermal fluid in sulfur and metal ions. * The ore materials are trapped within a fumarole field or a black smoker field when they are expelled into the ocean, cool, and precipitate sulfide minerals as stratiform sulfide ore. Some deposits show evidence of formation via deposition of sulfide via replacement of altered volcanosedimentary rocks and may also form by invasion of sulfur-rich brines into unconsolidated sediments.  Geology  The typical location for VMS deposits is at the top of the felsic volcanic sequence, within a sequence of volcaniclastic tuffaceous epiclastics, cherts, sediments or perhaps fine tuffs which are usually related to the underlying volcanics. The hangingwall to the deposit is broadly related to a more mafic sequence of volcanic rocks, either andesite (examples being Whim Creek & Mons Cupri, Western Australia or Millenbach, Canada), or basalt (Hellyer, Tasmania) or absent or sediments only (Kangaroo Caves, Western Australia). VMS deposits are associated spatially and temporally with felsic volcanic rocks, usually present in the stratigraphy below the deposit, and often as the direct footwall to the deposit. Sediments are usually contiguous with VMS deposits in some form or another and typically are present as (manganiferous) cherts and chemical sediments deposited within a submarine environment. The hanging wall to the deposit can be volcanic units essentially contiguous and coeval with the footwall rocks, indicating mineralisation was developed in an inter-eruptive pause; it may be volcanic rock dissimilar to the footwall volcanics in bimodal volcanic subtypes, or it could be sedimentary strata if mineralisation occurred toward the end of an eruptive cycle. Hybrid VMS-SEDEX deposits of the siliciclastic associations (see below) may be developed within interflow sediments or within units of sedimentary rocks which are present discontinuously throughout a larger and essentially contiguous volcanic package. Altogether, these geological features have been interpreted to show an association of VMS deposits with hydrothermal systems developed above or around submarine volcanic centres. =Morphology= VMS deposits have a wide variety of morphologies, with mound shaped and bowl shaped deposits most typical. The bowl-shaped formations formed due to venting of hydrothermal solutions into submarine depressions - in many cases, this type of deposit can be confused with sedimentary exhalative deposits. The mound-shaped deposits formed in a way similar to that of modern massive sulfide deposits - via production of a hydrothermal mound formed by successive black smoker chimneys. Deposits that have formed in environments dominated by sedimentary rocks or highly permeable volcanic rocks can show a tabular morphology that mimics the geometry of the surrounding rocks. VMS deposits have an ideal form of a conical area of highly altered volcanic or volcanogenic sedimentary rock within the feeder zone, which is called the stringer sulfide or stockwork zone, overlain by a mound of massive exhalites, and flanked by stratiform exhalative sulfides known as the apron. The stockwork zone typically consists of vein-hosted sulfides (mostly chalcopyrite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite) with quartz, chlorite and lesser carbonates and barite. The mound zone consists of laminated massive to brecciated pyrite, sphalerite (+/-galena), hematite, and barite. The mound can be up to several tens of metres thick and several hundred metres in diameter. The apron zone is generally more oxidised, with stratiform, laminated sulfidic sediments, similar to SEDEX ores, and is generally manganese, barium and hematite enriched, with cherts, jaspers and chemical sediments common. = Metal zonation = Most VMS deposits show metal zonation, caused by the changing physical and chemical environments of the circulating hydrothermal fluid. Ideally, this forms a core of massive pyrite and chalcopyrite around the throat of the vent system, with a halo of chalcopyrite-sphalerite-pyrite grading into a distal sphalerite-galena and galena-manganese and finally a chert-manganese-hematite facies. Most VMS deposits show a vertical zonation of gold, with the cooler upper portions generally more enriched in gold and silver. The mineralogy of VMS massive sulfide consists of over 90% iron sulfide, mainly in the form of pyrite, with chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena also being major constituents. Magnetite is present in minor amounts; as magnetite content increases, the ores grade into massive oxide deposits. The gangue (the uneconomic waste material) is mainly quartz and pyrite or pyrrhotite. Due to the high density of the deposits some have marked gravity anomalies (Neves-Corvo, Portugal) which is of use in exploration. = Alteration morphology = Alteration haloes developed by VMS deposits are typically conical in shape, occur mostly stratigraphically below the original fluid flow location (not necessarily the ore itself), and are typically zoned. The most intense alteration (containing the stringer sulfide zone) is generally located directly underneath the greatest concentration of massive sulfides, within the footwall volcanic sequence. If the stringer zone is displaced from the sulfides, it is often the product of tectonic deformation, or the formation of a hybrid SEDEX-like distal pool of sulfides. The alteration assemblages of the footwall alteration zone is, from core outwards; * Silica alteration zone, found in the most intensely altered examples, resulting in complete silica replacement of the host rocks, and associated with chalcopyrite-pyrite stringer zones. * Chlorite zone, found in nearly all examples, consisting of chlorite +/- sericite +/- silica. Often the host rock is entirely replaced by chlorite, which may appear as a chlorite schist in deformed examples. * Sericite zone, found in nearly all examples, consisting of sericite +/- chlorite +/- silica, * Silicification zone, often gradational with background silica-albite metasomatism. In all cases these alteration zones are metasomatism effects in the strictest sense, resulting in addition of potassium, silica, magnesium, and depletion of sodium. Chlorite minerals are usually more magnesian in composition within the footwall alteration zone of a VMS deposit than equivalent rocks within the same formation distally. The hangingwall to a VMS deposit is often weakly sodium depleted. Alteration not associated with the ore forming process may also be omnipresent both above and below the massive sulfide deposit. Typical alteration textures associated with devitrification of submarine volcanic rocks such as rhyolitic glasses, notably formation of spherulites, of perlite, lithophysae, and low-temperature prehnite-pumpellyite facies sub-seafloor alteration is ubiquitous though often overprinted by later metamorphic events. Metamorphic mineralogical, textural and structural changes within the host volcanic sequence may also further serve to disguise original metasomatic mineral assemblages.  Classification  Deposits of this class have been classified by numerous workers in different ways (e.g., metal sources, type examples, geodynamic setting - see Franklin et al. (1981) and Lydon (1984)). The magmatic assemblages of VMS deposits are associated with varying tectonic setting and geological environment during the formation of the VMS. The following five subclasses have specific petrochemical assemblages that resemble a specific geodynamic environment, during the event of formation: =Mafic associated= VMS deposits associated with geological environments dominated by mafic rocks, commonly ophiolite sequences. The Cyprus and Oman ophiolites host examples and ophiolite-hosted deposits are found in the Newfoundland Appalachians represent classic districts of this subclass. =Bimodal-mafic= VMS deposits associated with environments dominated by mafic volcanic rocks, but with up to 25% felsic volcanic rocks, the latter often hosting the deposits. The Noranda, Flin Flon-Snow Lake and Kidd Creek camps would be classic districts of this group. = Mafic-siliciclastic = VMS deposits associated with sub-equal proportions of mafic volcanic and siliciclastic rocks; felsic rocks can be a minor component; and mafic (and ultramafic) intrusive rocks are common. In metamorphic terranes may be known as or pelitic-mafic associated VMS deposits. The Besshi deposits in Japan and Windy Craggy, BC represent classic districts of this group. =Felsic-siliciclastic= VMS deposits associated with siliciclastic sedimentary rock dominated settings with abundant felsic rocks and less than 10% mafic material. These settings are often shale-rich siliciclastic-felsic or bimodal siliciclastic. The Bathurst camp, New Brunswick, Canada; Iberian Pyrite Belt, Spain and Portugal; and Finlayson Lake areas, Yukon, Canada are classic districts of this group. =Bimodal-felsic= Kuroko Massive Sulfide Cross section VMS deposits associated with bimodal sequences where felsic rocks are in greater abundance than mafic rocks with only minor sedimentary rocks. The Kuroko deposits, Japan; Buchans deposits, Canada; and Skellefte deposits, Sweden are classic districts of this group.  Distribution  In the geological past, the majority of VMS deposits were formed in rift environments associated with volcanic rocks. In particular, they formed throughout geological time associated with mid-ocean ridge spreading centres, back-arc spreading centres, and forearc spreading centres. A common theme to all environments of VMS deposits through time is the association with spreading (i.e., an extensional geodynamic regime). The deposits are typically associated with bimodal sequences (sequences with subequal percentages of mafic and felsic rocks - e.g., Noranda or Kuroko), felsic and sediment-rich environments (e.g., Bathurst), mafic and sediment- rich environments (e.g., Besshi or Windy Craggy), or mafic-dominated settings (e.g., Cyprus and other ophiolite hosted deposits). The majority of world deposits are small, with about 80% of known deposits in the range 0.1-10 Mt. Examples of VMS deposits are Kidd Creek, Ontario, Canada; Flin Flon in the Flin Flon greenstone belt, Manitoba, Canada (777 and Trout Lake Mine); Brunswick #12, New Brunswick, Canada; Rio Tinto, Spain; Greens Creek mine, Alaska, U.S..

The Lexington was a paddlewheel steamboat that operated along the Atlantic coast of the Northeastern United States between 1835 and 1840, before sinking in January 1840 due to an onboard fire. Commissioned by industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt, the ship was considered one of the most luxurious steamers in operation, and began service on a route between New York City and Providence, Rhode Island. In 1837, the Lexington switched to the route between New York and Stonington, Connecticut, the terminus of the newly built railroad from Boston. Vanderbilt sold the ship to his competitor, the New Jersey Steamship Navigation and Transportation Company, in December 1838 for $60,000, at which time the Lexington was reputedly the fastest steamer on Long Island Sound. On the night of 13 January 1840, midway through the ship's voyage, the casing around the ship's smokestack caught fire, igniting nearly 150 bales of cotton that were stored nearby. The resultant fire was impossible to extinguish, and necessitated the evacuation of the ship. The ships' overcrowded lifeboats were sunk almost immediately after their launch, leaving almost all of the ship's passengers and crew to drown in the freezing water, with rescue attempts impossible due to the rough water and lack of visibility. Of the estimated 143 people on board the Lexington, only four survived, having clung to large bales of cotton which had been thrown overboard. Specifications and route The Lexington was commissioned by Cornelius Vanderbilt in early 1834. The ship's keel was laid down at the Bishop and Simonson Shipyards in New York in September 1834. Unlike later steamboats, no detailed plans of the ship were made. Instead, a wooden model of the hull was carved and altered according to Vanderbilt's satisfaction. Using the model as a guide, full-sized outlines were then drawn in chalk on the timber to be used for the hull, which was then cut and assembled by carpenters. The engine of the Lexington was constructed at the West Point Foundry. Making use of a \\"walking beam\\" connection mechanism, activated by a steam cylinder with an stroke, the ship's engine was one of the most efficient of its time. Measuring in length and weighing , the Lexington was also one of the most luxuriously outfitted steamers on its route, incorporating ornate teak deck railings, cabin doors, staircases, and panelling; a large cabin including both a lounge and a dining saloon; and elegant deck lighting, curtains, and furniture. The Lexington began service as a day boat between New York City and Providence, Rhode Island in 1835. The ship began service to Stonington, Connecticut in 1837. She was sold to the New Jersey Steamship Navigation and Transportation Company in December 1838 for around US$60,000. From 1835 to 1840, the Lexington was the fastest vessel en route from New York City to Boston. Fire and wreck The Lexington left its pier on Manhattan's East River at 4:00 p.m. on January 13, 1840 bound for Stonington. She was carrying 143 passengers and crew and a cargo of 150 bales of cotton. The ship was expected to arrive in Stonington the following morning in time to meet the train that connected with Boston. The ship's usual captain, Jacob Vanderbilt (the brother of Cornelius), could not make the voyage owing to illness, and was replaced by veteran Captain George Child. At 7:30 p.m., the ship's first mate noticed that the woodwork and casings about the smokestack were on fire. The ship was four miles off Eaton's Neck on the north shore of Long Island. Crew members used buckets and boxes to throw water on the flames, as well as a small, hand-pumped fire engine. Once it was apparent that the fire could not be extinguished, the ship's three lifeboats were prepared for launch. The ship's paddlewheel was still churning at full speed, since crewmen could not reach the engine room to shut off the boilers. The first boat was sucked into the wheel, killing its occupants. Captain Child had fallen into the lifeboat and was among those killed. The ropes used to lower the other two boats were cut incorrectly, causing the boats to hit the water stern-first. Both boats promptly sank. Pilot Stephen Manchester turned the ship toward the shore in hopes of beaching it. The drive-rope that controlled the rudder quickly burned through, and the engine stopped two miles from shore. The ship, out of control, drifted northeast, away from land. The ship's cargo of cotton ignited quickly, causing the fire to spread from the smokestack to the entire superstructure. Passengers and crew threw empty baggage containers and bales of cotton into the water to be used as rafts. The center of the main deck collapsed shortly after 8:00 p.m. The fire spread to such an extent that most of the passengers and crew were forced to jump into the frigid water by midnight. Those who had nothing to climb onto quickly succumbed to hypothermia. The ship was still burning when it sank at 3:00 a.m. According to legend, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was scheduled to travel on the Lexington's fatal voyage, but missed it due to discussing the merits of a recent poem, The Wreck of the Hesperus, with a publisher. The poem also included a ship sinking. One of the passengers who was lost in the catastrophe was the noted radical minister and abolitionist Karl Follen (1796‚Äì1840). The disaster was depicted in a celebrated colored lithograph by Currier and Ives, and was their first major-selling print. A black-and-white lithograph was also produced from an eyewitness account. Survivors Of the 143 people on board the Lexington, only four survived: Chester Hilliard, 24, the only passenger to survive, had helped crew members throw bales of cotton to people in the water. He climbed onto the last bale at 8:00 p.m., along with ship's fireman Benjamin Cox. About eight hours later, Cox, weak from hypothermia, fell off the bale and drowned. At 11:00 a.m., Hilliard was rescued by the sloop Merchant. Stephen Manchester, the ship's pilot. He and about 30 others huddled at the bow of the ship until about midnight, when the flames closed in on them. Shortly after he stepped onto a makeshift raft with several passengers, the raft sank. He then climbed onto a bale of cotton with a passenger named Peter McKenna. Three hours later, McKenna died of exposure. Manchester was rescued by the sloop Merchant at noon. Charles Smith, one of the ship's firemen, descended the stern of the ship and clung to the ship's rudder along with four other people. The five dove into the sea just before the ship sank, around 3:00 a.m., and climbed onto a floating piece of the paddlewheel. The other four men died of exposure during the night, and Smith was rescued by the sloop Merchant at 2:00 the following afternoon. David Crowley, the second mate, drifted for 43 hours on a bale of cotton, coming ashore 50 miles east, at Baiting Hollow, Long Island. Weak, dehydrated and suffering from exposure, he staggered a mile to the house of Matthias and Mary Hutchinson, and collapsed after knocking on the door. A doctor was immediately summoned, and once well enough, Crowley was taken to Riverhead, where he recovered. Inquest An inquest jury found a fatal flaw in the ship's design to be the primary cause of the fire. The ship's boilers were originally built to burn wood, but were converted to burn coal in 1839. This conversion had not been properly completed. Not only did coal burn hotter than wood, but extra coal was being burned on the night of the fire because of rough seas. A spark from the over- heated smokestack set the stack's casing ablaze on the freight deck. The fire then spread to the bales of cotton, which were stored improperly close to the stack. Previous, smaller fires that had occurred due to the design flaw had been extinguished; however, nothing had been done to correct the problem. The jury also found crewmen's mistakes and violation of safety regulations to be at fault. Hilliard testified that once crew members noticed the fire, they went below deck to check the engines before attempting to fight the blaze. The jury believed that the fire could have been extinguished if the crew had acted immediately. Also, not all of the ship's fire buckets could be found during the fire. Only about 20 of the passengers were able to locate life preservers. The crew members were also careless in launching the lifeboats, all of which sank. The sloop Improvement, which had been less than five miles from the burning ship, never came to the Lexington's aid. Captain William Tirrell of the Improvement explained that he was running on a schedule; he did not attempt a rescue because he didn‚Äôt want to miss the high tide. The public became furious at this excuse, and Tirrell was attacked by the press in the days following the disaster. Ultimately, no legislation was passed by the U.S. government in the wake of the tragedy. It was not until the steamboat Henry Clay burned on the Hudson River 12 years later that new safety regulations were imposed. The Lexington fire remains Long Island Sound's worst steamboat disaster. One hundred thirty-nine of the 143 aboard perished. Salvage attempts An attempt was made to raise the Lexington in 1842. The ship was brought to the surface briefly, and a 30-pound (14 kg) mass of melted silver was recovered from the hull. The chains supporting the hull snapped, and the ship broke apart and sank back to the bottom of Long Island Sound. Today, the Lexington sits in 140 feet of water, broken into three sections. There is allegedly still gold and silver that has not been recovered. Adolphus S. Harnden of the Boston and New York Express Package Car Office had reportedly been carrying $18,000 in gold and silver coins and $80,000 in paper money at the time of the sinking. The silver recovered in 1842 is all that has been found to date.

It connects Walt Disney World with Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike before terminating at Simpson Road (formerly Boggy Creek Road) near Buenaventura Lakes, and is maintained by Osceola County. Only the section between the Southern Connector and a toll plaza east of Shingle Creek is tolled; the rest includes mainly at-grade intersections. A portion of the Osceola Parkway was once called Dart Boulevard. Route description The road starts at an intersection with an entrance road to the Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge in Lake Buena Vista. For its westernmost , it has many characteristics of an at-grade boulevard; however, east of the entrance to Disney's Animal Kingdom, it becomes a grade- separated expressway. Heading east, the parkway passes through several sections of the Disney World Complex before intersecting with World Drive and crossing into Osceola County. The parkway exits Walt Disney World, just before an interchange with I-4. Although Osceola Parkway was built across I-4 into Walt Disney World, an interchange with that freeway (Exit 65) did not open until 2001. The ramps with the exit to nearby SR 536 are interspersed such that traffic going on to I-4 from SR 536 cannot directly exit onto Osceola Parkway, and vice versa. The road then has an interchange with SR 417 (Southern Connector), where the Parkway becomes a limited access toll road (although not a full expressway). The parkway passes through residential areas, passing through an interchange with Poinciana Blvd., featuring ramp tolls of $1.00 for eastbound exiting traffic and westbound entering traffic. East of the interchange, Osceola Parkway crosses the one mainline toll plaza just east of Shingle Creek, with a $2.00 toll as of January 2020. Ice cream shop on Osceola Parkway East of the toll plaza, the tolled section of the parkway ends as it becomes a surface street, as it continues to pass through residential and shopping areas with at grade intersections, most notably with John Young Parkway and US 17/US 92/US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) as the road heads towards Florida's Turnpike. East of the Turnpike, the road continues as a four lane street through another residential development until its terminus at Simpson Road, near Buenaventura Lakes. Simpson Road was known as Boggy Creek Road until September 2014, which removed the unusual situation of having a three way intersection with all three roads having the same name. The Parkway originally used an electronic toll collection system known as O-PASS, however the county elected to discontinue its own toll collection program and instead contracted with the Orlando‚ÄìOrange County Expressway Authority (OOCEA) to provide that service, so the O-PASS system was merged with the E-PASS system. The Osceola Parkway also accepts SunPass accounts which are run by the Florida Department of Transportation and are accepted on most toll roads throughout the State of Florida. History Original logo featuring Osceola, used until c. 2003 The road originally opened as Dart Boulevard on June 16, 1987 as a two-mile stretch between U.S. Highway 441 and Buenaventura Boulevard. During the early 1990s, Disney World and Osceola County officials extended and upgraded the road to its current parkway form, widened the lanes from two to four and added an interchange with Florida's Turnpike, with the highway opening on August 18, 1995. A $19.2 million project has begun to widen of Osceola Parkway from two to four lanes between the intersections of Buenaventura Boulevard and Simpson Road from Myers Road to north of Osceola Parkway. The date of substantial completion for the second phase of work on the east-west road is April 1, 2015. Future The Osceola County Expressway Authority is planning an easterly extension as part of the Osceola County Beltway System. Following a 2012 feasibility study and a March 2013 public meeting, the project team decided on an alignment along the county line, either leaving the current roadway east of Windy Cove Drive (Bridgewater subdivision) or following the current roadway to its end at Simpson Road and curving northeast there. A spur would extend north to SR 417 near Orlando International Airport.Kimley-Horn and Associates, Osceola Parkway Extension and Boggy Creek Road/SR 417 Access Road PD&E; Study (presentation), uploaded April 28, 2014 Major intersections See also References External links *Osceola County Online - Osceola Parkway *Florida @ SouthEastRoads - Osceola Parkway (Osceola County 522) *Osceola Parkway Map *Osceola Parkway Extension Project Development and Environment Study Parkways in the United States Toll roads in Florida Walt Disney World Roads in Osceola County, Florida Non-freeway toll roads ","title":"Osceola Parkway"},{"id":"1778740","text":"Mister X or Mr. X is commonly used as a pseudonym for someone whose name is secret or unknown.

It emerged as a small state during the late Vedic period, with connections to the neighboring realm of Videha.Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, 97‚Äì265. Kosala belonged to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture (c. 700-300 BCE), and the Kosala region gave rise to the Sramana movements, including Jainism and Buddhism. It was culturally distinct from the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Vedic Aryans of Kuru-Pancala west of it, following independent development toward urbanisation and the use of iron. During the 5th century BCE, Kosala incorporated the territory of the Shakya clan, to which the Buddha belonged. According to the Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya and the Jaina text, the Bhagavati Sutra, Kosala was one of the Solasa (sixteen) Mahajanapadas (powerful realms) in 6th to 5th centuries BCE, and its cultural and political strength earned it the status of a great power. It was later weakened by a series of wars with the neighbouring kingdom of Magadha and, in the 5th century BCE, was finally absorbed by it. After collapse of the Maurya Empire and before the expansion of the Kushan Empire, Kosala was ruled by the Deva dynasty, the Datta dynasty, and the Mitra dynasty. Religious textual references =In Puranas= Kosala is not mentioned in the early Vedic literature, but appears as a region in the later Vedic texts of the Satapatha Brahmana (7th-6th centuries BCE,\\"Early Indian history: Linguistic and textual parametres.\\" in The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia, edited by G. Erdosy (1995), p. 136 final version 300 BCEThe Satapatha Brahmana. Sacred Books of the East, Vols. 12, 26, 24, 37, 47, translated by Julius Eggeling [published between 1882 and 1900]) and the Kalpasutras (6th-century BCE). In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Puranas the ruling family of the Kosala kingdom was the Ikshvaku dynasty, which was descended from king Ikshvaku. The Puranas give lists of kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty from Ikshvaku to Prasenajit (Pali: Pasenadi). According to the Ramayana, Rama ruled the Kosala kingdom from his capital, Ayodhya. =In Buddhist and Jain texts= Procession of Prasenajit of Kosala leaving Sravasti to meet the Buddha, Sanchi.Marshall p.59 Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism taught in Kosala. A Buddhist text, the Majjhima Nikaya mentions Buddha as a Kosalan, which indicates that Kosala may have subjugated the Shakya clan, which the Buddha is traditionally believed to have belonged to. History =Pre-Mauryan= Kosala Karshapana, 5th century BCE. In the time of king Mahakosala, the conquered neighboring kingdom of Kashi had become an integral part of the Kosala kingdom. Mahakosala's daughter Kosaladevƒ´ married with king BimbisƒÅra (5th cent. BCE) of Magadha.what-buddha- said.net, MahƒÅkosala Mahakosala was succeeded by his son Pasenadi (Prasenajit) (5th cent. BCE), who was a follower of the Buddha. During Pasenadi's absence from the capital, his minister Digha Charayana raised Pasedani's son Vidudabha Virudhaka to the throne. During the reign of Vidudabha, Raja Bir Sen of the Baghochia Dynasty invaded the Shakya Clan, to which the Buddha belonged, and brought the territory under the sovereignty of Kosala.History of Hathwa Raj by G.N.Dutt https://archive.org/stream/historyofhutwara00dutt/historyofhutwara00dutt_djvu.txt Not much later, the Kosala kingdom was defeated by Ajatashatru (5th or early 4th cent. BCE) of the Magadhan Haryanka dynasty, and absorbed into the Magadha kingdom, which formed the basis of the Mauryan empire. Kosala was finally annexed by Shishunaga. =Under Mauryan rule= It is assumed that during the Mauryan reign, Kosala was administratively under the viceroy at Kaushambi. The Sohgaura copper plate inscription, probably issued during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya deals with a famine in Shravasti and the relief measures to be adopted by the officials. The Yuga Purana section of the Garga Samhita mentions about the Yavana (Indo-Greek) invasion and subsequent occupation of Saket during the reign of the last Maurya ruler Brihadratha. =Post-Mauryan period= Coin of ruler Muladeva, minted in Ayodhya, Kosala. Obv: Muladevasa, elephant to left facing symbol. Rev: Wreath, above symbol, below snake. Coin of ruler Aryamitra, issued in Ayodhya, Kosala. Obv: peacock to right facing tree. Rev: Name Ayyamitasa, humped bull to left facing pole. The names of a number of rulers of Kosala of the post-Maurya period are known from the square copper coins issued by them, mostly found at Ayodhya.Bhandare (2006) The rulers, forming the Deva dynasty, are: Muladeva, Vayudeva, Vishakhadeva, Dhanadeva, Naradatta, Jyesthadatta and Shivadatta. There is no way to know whether king Muladeva of the coins is identifiable with Muladeva, murderer of the Shunga ruler Vasumitra or not (though a historian, Jagannath has tried to do so). King Dhanadeva of the coins is identified with king Dhanadeva (1st century BCE) of Ayodhya inscription. In this Sanskrit inscription, King Kaushikiputra Dhanadeva mentions about setting a ketana (flag-staff) in memory of his father, Phalgudeva. In this inscription he claimed himself as the sixth in descent from Pushyamitra Shunga. Dhanadeva issued both cast and die-struck coins and both the types have a bull on obverse. Other local rulers whose coins were found in Kosala include: a group of rulers whose name ends in \\"-mitra\\" is also known from their coins: Satyamitra, Aryamitra, Vijayamitra and Devamitra, sometimes called the \\"Late Mitra dynasty of Kosala\\".Proceedings - Indian History Congress - Volume 1 - Page 74 Other rulers known from their coins are: Kumudasena, Ajavarman and Sanghamitra.Papers on the Date of Kani·π£ka, Arthur Llewellyn Basham Brill Archive, 1969, p.118 Geography The Kosala region had three major cities, Ayodhya, Saket and Shravasti, and a number of minor towns as Setavya, Ukattha, Dandakappa, Nalakapana and Pankadha. According to the Puranas and the Ramayana epic, Ayodhya was the capital of Kosala during the reign of Ikshvaku and his descendants. Shravasti is recorded as the capital of Kosala during the Mahajanapada period (6th‚Äì5th centuries BCE), but post-Maurya (2nd‚Äì1st centuries BCE) kings issued their coins from Ayodhya. Culture and religion Kosala belonged to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture (c. 700-300 BCE), which was preceded by the Black and red ware culture (c.c. 1450-1200 BCE until c. 700-500 BCE). The Central Gangetic Plain was the earliest area for rice cultivation in South Asia, and entered the Iron Age around 700 BCE. According to Geoffrey Samuel, following Tim Hopkins, the Central Gangetic Plain was culturally distinct from the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Vedic Aryans of Kuru-Pancala west of it, and saw an independent development toward urbanisation and the use of iron. Local religions, before and during the rise of Buddhism and the later influence of the Vedic-Brahmanical traditions, were centered on laukika or worldly deities, including yaksas, guardian deities. According to Samuel, there is \\"extensive iconographical evidence for a religion of fertility and auspiciousness. According to Hopkins, the region was marked by a In contrast to the developing Brahmanical traditions of the Kuru-Pancala region, the Kosala region \\"was where the early ascetic movements, including the Buddhists and Jains, took shape, and it was also a very important area for the Upanishads and developments in Brahmanical traditions.\\" According to Samuels, Buddhism was not a protest against an already established Vedic-Brahmanical system, which developed in Kuru-Pancala, but an opposition against the growing influence of this Vedic-Brahmanical system, and the superior position granted to Brahmins in it.

The Rubik half hour was broadcast in reruns as a standalone series on ABC from May 4 to August 31, 1985. The program featured a magic Rubik's Cube named Rubik who could fly through the air and had other special powers. Rubik could only come alive when the colored squares on his sides had been matched up. The voice of Rubik, Ron Palillo, told TV Guide in 1983 that for the role, he spoke very slowly and then technicians sped up the tapes and raised the pitch. Palillo said Rubik's giggle was very different from the trademark laugh of Horshack, his character on the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter, and that it was pretty \\"for an inanimate object\\". Premise Rubik had fallen out of the stagecoach of an evil magician, who became the main villain of the series. Rubik helped Carlos, Lisa, and Reynaldo Rodriguez, in foiling the magician‚Äôs attempts to recover Rubik. Once, Rubik was recovered by a detective who was a relative of the magician, but then decided the children should keep Rubik as the magician would use him for evil and selfish purposes. Outside of the evil magician, episodes usually dealt with more normal adversaries, such as when the eldest son had run afoul of a bully who had thwarted his efforts to gain a potential girlfriend, while at the same time the bully was making himself appear decent to the girl. Rubik worked in secret to expose the bully‚Äôs true brutal personality in front of the girl. For dramatic purposes, the cube was easily fully scrambled (such as by being dropped or grabbed by the family dog, and at least once Rubik scrambled himself) and usually solved quickly by the Rodriguez children, although in stressful circumstances it took them longer. When scrambled, Rubik can only be heard making low-key gibberish and sometime can be heard saying, \\"Help.\\" Cast * Ron Palillo ‚Äì Rubik * Michael Bell ‚Äì Reynaldo Rodriguez * Jennifer Fajardo ‚Äì Lisa Rodriguez * Michael Saucedo ‚Äì Carlos Rodriguez * Angela Moya ‚Äì Marla Additional voices: Jack DeLeon, Alan Dinehart, Laurie Faso, Takayo Fischer, Bob Holt, Tress MacNeille, Tysun McMullan, Neil Ross, John Stephenson, Janet Waldo, Alan Young Theme music In keeping with the Hispanic flavor of the show, the theme song was sung by Puerto Rican boy band Menudo.

In Norse mythology, Nanna Nepsd√≥ttir or simply Nanna is a goddess associated with the god Baldr. Accounts of Nanna vary greatly by source. In the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, Nanna is the wife of Baldr and the couple produced a son, the god Forseti. After Baldr's death, Nanna dies of grief. Nanna is placed on Baldr's ship with his corpse and the two are set aflame and pushed out to sea. In Hel, Baldr and Nanna are united again. In an attempt to bring back Baldr from the dead, the god Herm√≥√∞r rides to Hel and, upon receiving the hope of resurrection from the being Hel, Nanna gives Herm√≥√∞r gifts to give to the goddess Frigg (a robe of linen), the goddess Fulla (a finger-ring), and others (unspecified). Nanna is frequently mentioned in the poetry of skalds and a Nanna, who may or may not be the same figure, is mentioned once in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources. An account provided by Saxo Grammaticus in his 12th century work Gesta Danorum records Nanna as a human female, the daughter of King Gevar, and the love interest of both the demi-god Baldr and the human H√∂√∞r. Spurred by their mutual attraction to Nanna, Baldr and H√∂√∞r repeatedly do battle. Nanna is only interested in H√∂√∞r and weds him, while Baldr wastes away from nightmares about Nanna. The Setre Comb, a comb from the 6th or early 7th century featuring runic inscriptions, may reference the goddess. The etymology of the name Nanna is a subject of scholarly debate. Scholars have debated connections between Nanna and other similarly named deities from other cultures and the implications of the goddess' attestations. Etymology and place names The etymology of the name of the goddess Nanna is debated. Some scholars have proposed that the name may derive from a babble word, nanna, meaning \\"mother\\". Scholar Jan de Vries connects the name Nanna to the root *nan√æ-, leading to \\"the daring one\\". Scholar John Lindow theorizes that a common noun may have existed in Old Norse, nanna, that roughly meant \\"woman\\".For \\"babble word\\" etymology, see Simek (2007:227), Orchard (1997:117), and Lindow (2001:236). For Jan de Vries' root theory, see Simek (2007:227). For John Lindow's common noun theory, see Lindow (2001:236). Scholar John McKinnell notes that the \\"mother\\" and *nan√æ- derivations may not be distinct, commenting that nanna may have once meant \\"she who empowers\\".McKinnell (2005:144). Attestations =Poetic Edda= Baldr and Nanna (1882) by Friedrich Wilhelm Heine In the Poetic Edda poem Hyndlulj√≥√∞, a figure by the name of Nanna is listed as the daughter of N√∂kkvi and as a relative of √ìttar. This figure may or may not be the same Nanna as Baldr's wife.Larrington (1997:314). =Prose Edda= In Hel Baldr, holding Nanna, waves to Herm√≥√∞r (1893) by George Percy Jacomb-Hood In chapter 38 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High explains that Nanna Nepsd√≥ttir (the last name meaning \\"Nepr's daughter\\") and her husband Baldr produced a son, the god Forseti.Faulkes (1995:26). Later in Gylfaginning (chapter 49), High recounts Baldr's death in Asgard at the unwitting hands of his blind brother, H√∂√∞r. Baldr's body is taken to the seaside and, when his body is placed unto his ship Hringhorni, Nanna's collapses and dies of grief. Her body is placed upon Hringhorni with Baldr, the ship is set aflame, and the god Thor hallows the pyre with his hammer Mj√∂lnir.Faulkes (1995:49). Sent by Baldr's mother, the goddess Frigg, the god Herm√≥√∞r rides to the location of Hel to resurrect Baldr. Herm√≥√∞r finally arrives in Hel to find Baldr in a hall, seated in the seat of honor and with his wife Nanna. Herm√≥√∞r bargains with Hel, the being, for Baldr's resurrection. Hel and Herm√≥√∞r come to an agreement and then Baldr and Nanna accompany Herm√≥√∞r out of the hall. Baldr gives Herm√≥√∞r the ring Draupnir, which the god Odin had placed on Baldr's pyre, to return to Odin. Nanna presents to Herm√≥√∞r a series of gifts: a linen robe for Frigg, a golden ring for the goddess Fulla, and other unspecified items. Herm√≥√∞r returns to Asgard.Faulkes (1995:49‚Äî50). In the first chapter of the Prose Edda book Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, Nanna is listed among 8 goddesses attending a feast held in honor of √Ügir.Faulkes (1995:59). In chapter 5 of Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, means of referring to Baldr are provided, including \\"husband of Nanna\\".Faulkes (1995:74). In chapter 19, means of referring to Frigg are provided, including \\"mother-in-law of Nanna.\\"Faulkes (1995:86). In chapter 75, Nanna is included among a list of goddesses.Faulkes (1995:157). In chapter 18, the skald Eil√≠fr Go√∞r√∫narson's work √û√≥rsdr√°pa is quoted, which includes a kenning that references Nanna (\\"wake-hilt-Nanna\\" for \\"troll-wife\\").Faulkes (1995:83). =Gesta Danorum= Baldr secretly watches Nanna bathing (1898) by Louis Moe In book III of Gesta Danorum, Nanna is not a goddess but rather a daughter of the mortal King Gevar. Nanna is attracted to her foster-brother H√∂√∞r (also here a human), son of Hothbrodd, and \\"seeks his embraces\\". One day, Baldr, who Saxo describes as the son of the god Odin, witnesses Nanna bathing and lusts for her; \\"the sheen of her graceful body inflamed him and her manifest charms seared his heart, for there is no stronger incitement to lust than beauty.\\" Fearing that H√∂√∞r will serve as an obstacle for his conquest of Nanna, Baldr resolves to slay H√∂√∞r.Davidson, Fisher (2008:69). While out hunting, H√∂√∞r loses his path in a mist and a group of forest maidens greet him by name. The maidens tell him that they are able to guide fate, and that they appear invisibly on battlefields, where they award victory or defeat at their whim. They inform H√∂√∞r that Baldr witnessed Nanna bathing, yet warn H√∂√∞r not to challenge Baldr to combat‚Äîno matter what he may do‚Äîfor Baldr sprang from divine seed and is therefore a demi-god. The maidens and their dwelling vanish and H√∂√∞r finds himself standing in a wide open plain. Saxo explains that H√∂√∞r had been tricked by means of magic.Davidson, Fisher (2008:68‚Äî69). H√∂√∞r returns home, recounts to King Gevar that he had lost his path and been tricked by the forest maidens, and immediately asks King Gevar for his daughter Nanna's hand in wedlock. Gevar tells H√∂√∞r that he would most certainly approve of the marriage, but that Baldr has already requested Nanna's hand. Gevar says that he fears Baldr's wrath, for Baldr's body is infused with a holy strength and cannot be harmed by steel. Gevar is, however, aware of a sword that will kill Baldr, and he explains that it is very well protected, and tells him how to retrieve the sword.Davidson, Fisher (2008:70). After H√∂√∞r retrieves the loot, a series of events occur unrelated to Baldr and Nanna. Meanwhile, Baldr takes arms and goes into Gevar's kingdom to claim Nanna as his own. Gevar tells Baldr to reason with Nanna, and this Baldr does with care. However, Baldr makes no progress; Nanna dodges his advances by arguing that the offspring of a deity cannot marry a mortal due to the differences in their nature. H√∂√∞r learns of Baldr's actions. Helgi and H√∂√∞r battle Baldr and other gods (who are unnamed outside of Thor and Odin), resulting in a victory for H√∂√∞r's forces. After the victory, H√∂√∞r again asks Gevar for Nanna's hand and so wins Nanna's embraces. H√∂√∞r and Nanna go to Sweden and there H√∂√∞r becomes ruler.Davidson, Fisher (2008:70‚Äî73). In Sweden, H√∂√∞r is attacked by Baldr and defeated. H√∂√∞r flees back to Denmark with Nanna. Despite the victory, Baldr is tormented at night by visions of Nanna, resulting in his deterioration: > :[Baldr] was incessantly tormented at night by phantoms which mimicked the > shape of Nanna and caused him to fall into such an unhealthy condition that > he could not even walk properly. For this reason he took to travelling in a > chariot or carriage. The violent passion that soaked his heart brought him > almost to the verge of collapse. He judged that victory had yielded him > nothing if it had not given him Nanna as a prize.Davidson, Fisher (2008:73). Archaeological record The Setre Comb, a comb from the 6th or early 7th century featuring runic inscriptions, may reference the goddess. The comb is the subject of an amount of scholarly discourse as most experts accept the reading of the Germanic charm word alu and Nanna, though there exists questions as to if Nanna is the same figure as the goddess from later attestations.Macleod (2006:24) Theories Some scholars have attempted to link Old Norse Nanna with the Sumerian goddess Inanna, the goddess Babylonian Ishtar, or the Phrygian goddess Nana, mother of the god Attis. Scholar Rudolf Simek opines that identification with Inanna, Nannar or Nana is \\"hardly likely\\" due to the large distances in time and location between the figures.Simek (2007:227). Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that while \\"the idea of a link with Sumerian Inanna , 'Lady of Heaven', was attractive to early scholars\\" the notion \\"seems unlikely.\\"Davidson, Fisher (2008:51).

In Trinidad and Tobago, this thrush is also known as big-eye grieve. The similar but allopatric Ecuadorian thrush was formerly considered a subspecies of the bare-eyed thrush and named T. n. maculirostris; it is now normally considered as a separate species T. maculirostris. It has a narrower eyering and is only found in forest and woodland in western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Description The spectacled thrush is 23-24 cm long and weighs 60 g. It is plain olive-brown above and paler brown below. The throat is brown-streaked off-white, and the lower belly is whitish. It has a prominent yellow eye ring which gives rise to its English and scientific names. There are two poorly defined subspecies, differing mainly in the darkness of the plumage. Sexes are similar, but young birds are flecked above and spotted below, and have a thinner eye ring. The song is a musical warble, slower and lower pitched than that of the cocoa thrush (T. fumigatus), and it also produces a cat-like queeoow call and, when uncomfortable, emits a kereel. Ecology The habitat of this large thrush is open woodland, forest clearings and cultivation. The bare-eyed thrush mainly feeds on or near the ground on fruit, berries and some insects and earthworms. It is a shy species, but on Trinidad and Tobago it is much tamer, and will come to feeders and take food from tables. The nest is a lined bulky cup of twigs low in a tree. The two to three reddish-blotched deep-blue eggs are incubated by the female alone. References * Clement, Peter & Hathaway, Ren (2000): Thrushes.

Larry is a middle-aged, balding nerd who, following a lifelong virginity, has suddenly become obsessed with sex and now lives a new life, awkwardly trying and usually badly failing to seduce attractive women. Due to the popularity of the series in the later 1980s and early 1990s, Larry was one of the well known video game characters during that era. Appearances In his backstory, Larry Laffer had been a nerdy geek all his life and eventually became a computer programmer. He never had close relations with friends, women, or his colleagues, and every day of his life was identical as he lived with his mother. Around his 38th birthday, his brain hit a sexual alarm and started having his first kinky thoughts, when he started reading adult magazines and could not concentrate on his work. Because of this his life was destroyed: he was fired from his job, and upon returning home he found his house had been sold and his mother had gone on vacation. Larry then decided to turn a page forward in his life, and he left everything to move to the city of Lost Wages (a pun on Las Vegas), where, assuming that 1970s styles were still trendy, he bought a polyester leisure suit. He sold his Volkswagen Bug to a junkyard for $94 and ended up outside Lefty's Bar, where the first game, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, begins. During the course of the series of games, Larry loses his virginity, is married twice (and dumped twice), becomes a hero of the tropical island Nontoonyt in Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places), and eventually, in Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals, meets his semi-other half, a beautiful woman known as Passionate Patti (who, for some parts of this game as well as of Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work, is controlled by the player). However, in his more recent games, Patti is absent and Larry roams alone again. The Official Book of Leisure Suit Larry, which was written between Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out! and Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!, hints that Larry was still engaged with Patti during that period, but Al Lowe said in 1999, \\"I doubt Patti will return to haunt Larry again.\\" Outside of his adventure game series, appears in Sierra's Hoyle Book of Games, Volume I, The Laffer Utilities, Larry Pops Up!, Leisure Suit Larry's Casino, Leisure Suit Larry's Sexy Pinball, Leisure Suit Larry Bikini Beach Volley, the mobile game version of Love for Sail, and the online casino Larry Casino. Conception and design Regarding Larry's male chauvinism, his designer Al Lowe said that Larry is intended as a satire of that type of man, rather than an endorsement of it. Lowe said he looked for an unconventional adventure game protagonist that could be \\"butt of all the jokes\\" in a game that would not be about saving the world or rescuing princesses but would rather deal with adult themes using humor. He recalled: \\"I tried to make him the opposite of a GQ model: short, overweight, balding, with comb-over hair, and so on. Larry is out of shape, losing his hair, not very successful with women, always thinking about sex - in other words, he's exactly like most guys. (...) The tough part was making Larry likable, since at first glance, he comes off as smarmy, sexist, and unlikable. I tried to make Larry resemble most guys I know: neither morons nor geniuses, basically honest and good, with a desire for more sex than they actually get. Men relate to Larry because no matter how big a loser you are, you're not as bad off as Larry!\\" In Lowe's words, Larry was \\"modeled after a salesman for [Lowe's game company] Sierra On-Line that shall remain nameless. He would return from sales trip and brag to us about how much ass he had gotten. Those of us sitting there coding hated him.\\" While making Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, Sierra On-Line staff had to decide the character's name. They agreed that he should be named after a certain Jerry (Lowe never made his last name known to the public), who had visited him at work and became well known in the Sierra studios. Jerry thought of himself as a great lover and became an infamous point of comical reference among the staff, so the game creators agreed that since Jerry's character suited the game's protagonist, they should jokingly tribute him. However, since they thought it would be immoral to use a real person's full name as a comical reference, \\"Jerry\\" was then altered to \\"Larry\\", a similar name, in honor of injury attorney Larry H. Parker, a childhood friend of Lowe. Lowe had to find a new surname, and having in mind the many L-words of the title, skimmed through the 'L' volume of an encyclopedia in order to find a suitable word or name. He fell on the entry of Arthur Laffer, and the name caught his attention due to its phonetic resemblance to 'laugher'. Arthur Laffer for years had no idea about the existence of the games until much later when Lowe sent a letter asking his permission for the publication of a program under the title Laffer Utilities, a Larry spin-off which could potentially confuse the public due to the ambiguous title. Laffer asked his secretary if she knew about the games and she told him that she had played them for years, but never made a connection. Laffer gave the permission and also paid a visit to the Sierra studios. One of Larry's trademarks is his manner of introducing himself: \\"Hi, my name is Larry; Larry Laffer\\", a reference to James Bond's introduction style, \\"My name is Bond; James Bond\\". The \\"Leisure Suit\\" part came from Al Lowe's statement to Sierra founder Ken Williams that the series' predecessor Softporn Adventure was so dated that it should be wearing a leisure suit. The rest of his look includes \\"a Hawaiian shirt, a gold medallion, and a chest toupee because [Lowe] wanted him to be as out of it as possible.\\" Originally, Larry was a typical 16-colored sprite, although on box covers he was seen as a cartoon with huge triangular head and nose. Lowe said about Larry's nose: \\"When we started, [Sierra artist] Mark Crowe gave me a choice: Larry could have either a huge nose or no nose because with only 160 pixels horizontally, his 'nose pixel' could be either on or off. Later, as graphics developed, Larry's look became more refined, but always in keeping with his loser image.\\" As technology advanced to allow more cartoon-like graphics, the VGA games updated the sprite to resemble the depiction of Larry on the covers. In the latter games with full voice-over soundtrack, Larry is voiced by actor Jan Rabson in all games except Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust, where he is voiced by Jeffrey Tambor. Reception According to Zero in 1992, Larry Laffer has been \\"a favourite among PC users for years\\" and GameSpot later recalled how Larry's personality flaws helped to \\"turn the unappealing antihero into a cash cow\\" for Sierra On-Line at the time. In 1995, Next Generation stated that \\"It's widely believed that Larry (Leisure Suit and all) is the most widely played computer game character ever, thanks to the game's early introduction, its multitude of sequels, and good old-fashioned piracy.\\" Lowe said \\"Sierra surveyed Larry players and found that they strongly match the gameplaying population in general, with one exception: A higher proportion are women! My theory is that women relate to Larry because at least once they've all dated a jerk like him.\\" German magazine PC Games ranked Larry sixth on their 2002 list of the best game characters of all time, as \\"nobody fails as funny as Al Lowe's notorious adventure hero.\\" Retro Gamer included him in their 2004 list of top 50 game heroes, noting that \\"after several episodes, Larry is still as balding and hapless as ever, but he's just never going to stop on his endless quest for lurve.\\"Retro Gamer 2, page 39. He was voted the 45th top video game character of all time in a 2011 online poll on the website of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition.

He was schooled at Elwood Central School, Prahran Technical School and Melbourne High School, and then studied architecture at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology before working in advertising. His first novel was the comic Rappaport (Hodder and Stoughton, 1966) and focused on a day in the life of a young Melbourne antique dealer and his immature friend, Friedlander. The characters, transplanted to London, were further chronicled in Rappaport's Revenge (1973). Lurie's self-exile from Australia to Europe, the UK and Northern Africa provides much of the material for his fiction. His second novel was The London Jungle Adventures of Charlie Hope (Hodder and Stoughton, 1968). Flying Home (1978) was named by the National Book Council as one of the ten best Australian books of the decade. Subsequent novels are Seven Books for Grossman (1983)‚Äîreally a novella parodying the styles of various authors‚Äîand Madness (1991), about a writer dealing with a mentally unstable girlfriend. Lurie is best known for his short stories. In 2000 he wrote an instructional guide When and How to Write Short Stories and What They Are. His stories have been published in many prestigious magazines, including The New Yorker, The Virginia Quarterly, Punch, The Times, The Telegraph Magazine, Transatlantic Review, Island, Meanjin, Overland, Quadrant and Westerly.

He resides in New York City. Using a wide spectrum of components, his work often includes organic materials, such as flowers, food and sand, in addition to deconstructed computer parts, auto-parts and a multitude of found and collected objects. His installations often include mandala-like forms, pyramids, maps, grids and mushroom clouds and the Ouroboros.  Early life and education Joe Mangrum was born in Florissant, Missouri, near St. Louis. He started taking oil painting lessons when he was 8. At age 16 he won a trip to India, in an art competition sponsored by the Asia Society. His entry in the contest was a painting which portrayed a series of baskets representing his limited knowledge of India. The trip sparked an interest in travel and multicultural influences. Mangrum attended The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991. His focus of study was on painting and photography, though after art school he began to expand his work into site-specific, environmental and ephemeral installations. Sand paintings Mangrum's \\"Asynchronous Syntropy\\" sand painting Joe Mangrum has created hundreds of sand paintings in public spaces of New York City. Each large scale sand painting is spontaneously created by pouring colored sand into multiple patterns over the course of a day and is often fifteen to twenty feet in diameter. He cites influences from many sources in what he calls, ‚Äú...organic symmetry where the feeling of the design is of a living being outstretched on the pavement...images may intertwine like a Celtic knot or represent nature like a sea anemone, DNA strands or some biomorphic form, sometimes very psychedelic.‚Äù He also describes \\"... an urban free-style and combined with bright 'Pop Art' colors, fractal variations and circuitry. My paintings are influenced by an abundant world of undersea creatures, carnivorous plants emanating electrical impulses, a living mathematical amalgam and botanical geometry stemming cross-cultural metaphors...\\" He also cites influences such as Rangoli, Buddhist mandalas, Navajo sand paintings, mosaics in Islamic art and the rose windows of European cathedrals. He has been commissioned to create site-specific sand paintings for The Museum of Arts and Design, FLAG Arts Foundation, Corcoran Gallery Rotunda, Asia Society, United Nations School and Adelphi University. Mangrum has also produced sand paintings in San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit and San Cristobal, Mexico. Early work and California After graduating from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Mangrum traveled for over four years in Europe and throughout the United States. Eventually he settled in Laguna Beach, California and began to arrange floral and natural materials into installations in public spaces. These often, circular forms have been called mandalas, though Mangrum has more recently chosen to describe them as biomorphic or organic installations. His first installations in Laguna Beach stemmed from a desire to draw attention to the impending San Joaquin Hills Toll Road(California State Route 73) in 1994. The road would divide one of the last major open green spaces in Orange County, California. His newly found activism propelled his determination to examine environmental issues in the forum of public art. He began to create organic forms at Main Beach Park, a public space in Laguna Beach. His art work was swept up by the Parks Department, so he continued to create new pieces and they were relentlessly swept up again. This resulted in a visit to a city council meeting by Mangrum. The council demanded that he provide one million dollars worth of liability insurance. The story was picked up by the L.A. Times and thereby sparked further discussion about art, its expression and the right to protest. Mangrum was invited to produce his first solo show at San Francisco State University in 1995 . This show marked his first usage of found objects, auto parts and money in addition to his organic materials. It consisted of five biomorphic forms on the ground with a wall painting in binary code of the story of the Lorax by Dr. Seuss, contained in an enlarged image of Mangrum‚Äôs thumbprint. Once Mangrum had acquired insurance, he returned to Laguna beach and created installations titled ‚ÄúCreation, Capitalism and Corrective Surgery,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEchoes of Corrective Surgery‚Äù based on his observations of life in Southern California. A second L.A. Times article in 1995 caught the eye of art gallerist, Daniel Arvizu, who invited Mangrum to install a solo show at his gallery in Santa Ana, California. Mangrum created an ephemeral installation inspired by Bosch‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Garden of Earthly Delights‚Äù using molasses (as a substitute for oil) and orange slices in an interpretation of observations of the oil industry and its environmental ‚Äúpurgatories‚Äù in Orange County. Mangrum continued his use of Molasses in combination with wheat grass and piano parts in a group show entitled ‚ÄúThe Embarrassment of Riches,‚Äù at Huntington Beach Art Center curated by Marilu Knode. San Francisco Mangrum took up residence in San Francisco in the mid-1990s after many years of traveling and continued to make public art both spontaneously and commissioned projects by the city of San Francisco. He was commissioned for two permanent terrazzo artworks that can be found on opposite corners of Mission and 22nd streets in San Francisco. In addition, an ephemeral installation titled ‚Äú Trans-mission 98‚Äù, was created at Justin Herman Plaza. This temporary installation consisted of dismantling the artist‚Äôs car and arranging it as a cityscape with organic elements of sod in Justin Herman Plaza. A reporter from the San Francisco Chronicle hastily ran the license plate number of the car and wrote an article incorrectly stating that a deal had been struck between the city and Mangrum to exchange his commission fee for absolution of multiple parking tickets. The article was picked up by various papers and blogs including ‚ÄúNews of the Weird.‚Äù This controversy resulted in Ralph Guggenheim, the chair of the visual arts committee at the Art Commission, clarifying in a letter to the editor that ‚Äú...The San Francisco Art Commission did not, and does not cut deals with artists. Mr. Mangrum, like any citizen, is responsible for paying his parking tickets. The implication that the commission approved this work instead of paying the tickets is ridiculous.‚Äù In 2005, in celebration of World Environment Day, Mangrum created a 40 ft tall and 16 ft wide Mushroom Cloud of live wheatgrass. The project was grown over a 2-week period in various locations in San Francisco and contained 300 lbs of dry wheatgrass seed. The cloud towered over an artificial cityscape made from industrial parts. The title of the project was \\"Detonation Earth\\" and was installed at Red Ink Studios in San Francisco. Mangrum continued to utilize organic elements such as wheatgrass, flowers and palm leaves with car parts, bullets, machine wheels, and sand in his large scale ephemeral installations. He created site specific works for SFMOMA Gallery at Fort Mason San Francisco Museum of Modern Art#SFMOMA Artists Gallery at Fort Mason, Bioneers Conference and the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. Mangrum also continued to produce three-dimensional installations at local galleries such as Urbis Artium, (now Mark Wolfe Contemporary Art), pop up exhibits and festivals. Additionally, he founded an alternative warehouse space known as Facility 3 from 1997 to 2003, which functioned as a multi-use art studio and event space that hosted many performers and theatrical groups like Shotgun Players and musicians such as Sean Hayes (musician), Jolie Holland, Extra Action Marching Band; various Burning Man and DJ events, including the late DJ Cheb i Sabbah and Lorin aka Bassnectar. New York In 2008, Mangrum moved to New York. He had installed a solo show titled, ‚ÄúImpressions‚Äù at Chi Contemporary Gallery (now Causey Contemporary) in Brooklyn, 2006. This solo show marked the emergence of sand painting as a primary feature in his work. He produced a second solo show at Chi Contemporary in 2009, titled ‚ÄúChrysalis Stage.‚Äù Mangrum began his series of over 700 sand paintings in public spaces of New York City in 2009 and continues currently. The public is most likely to view these paintings periodically in Washington Square Park and Union Square, Manhattan. In 2010, he created a sand runway for designer Jen Kao during Fashion Week which landed him Vanity Fair as a cartoon. Mangrum has appeared on multiple media outlets and blogs. He regularly posts updates of his works in progress live on social media and his website. His sand-stained hands were included on the cover of Humans of New York (HONY), by photographer, Brandon Stanton. Broadcasts After a brief appearance in 2012, where a time lapse was created at Washington Square Park for the \\"Word on the Street\\", Joe was a guest on Sesame Street in 2013 featured in the \\"People in Your Neighborhood segment with Murray and Ovejita, creating a portrait of the pair of Muppets in sand with a distinctive background of The Mona Lisa. He has also been interviewed for the PBS art program, Spark on KQED, 2006 and PBS, Chicago Tonight WTTW, 2013. Festivals Joe Mangrum has designed and created sculptural installations and architectural pieces for Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, The Electric Daisy Carnival, The Mile High Music Festival and All Points West Music & Arts Festival among many others.

The city grew as an economic center with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825; the growth of its railroads added to its dominance. Tammany Hall began to grow in influence with the support of many Irish immigrants, culminating in the election of the first Tammany mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854. The city had become the nation's most important port and financial center and competed with Boston as the center of high culture. Status =As a capitol city= With the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 and the resulting withdrawal of British troops from the city, the Congress of the Confederation moved to Federal Hall on Wall Street in 1785. The first government of the United States, operating under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union since its ratification in 1781, was soon found inadequate for the needs of the new nation. However, certain successes were achieved while in New York, including the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, which laid the framework for the addition of new states into the Union. A call for revision to the Articles was led by New Yorker Alexander Hamilton, and the Annapolis Convention was convened with representatives from the states to discuss the necessary changes. Lacking representation from all of the states, the convention made no suggestions for changing the Articles but instead drafted a report that led to the creation of a Constitutional Convention in 1787 to create an entirely new governing document. =As a federal city= The city's and state's status within the new union under the United States Constitution written in 1787 was under question when Governor George Clinton proved reluctant to submit state power to a strong national government and was opposed to ratification. Some New York City businessmen proposed New York City secession as an alternative to joining the union separately, but Alexander Hamilton and others argued persuasively in the Federalist Papers, published in city newspapers, for state ratification, which after much dispute finally passed in 1788. George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States on the balcony of Federal Hall in 1789, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted in the city. The Supreme Court of the United States sat for the first time in New York. After 1790, Congress left for Philadelphia.  Population growth and economic leadership An 1807 version of the Commissioner's Grid plan for Manhattan; it was adopted in 1811. New York remained a cosmopolitan enclave within America. The new French consul gave a report in 1810: :\\"its inhabitants, who are for the most part foreigners and made up of every nation except Americans so to speak, have in general no mind for anything but business. New York might be described as a permanent fair in which two-thirds of the population is always being replaced; where huge business deals are being made, almost always with fictitious capital, and where luxury has reached alarming heights... It is in the countryside and in the inland towns that one must look for the American population of New York State.\\" (quoted by Fernand Braudel, The Perspective of the World, 1984 p 406). The French consul's \\"fictitious capital\\" betokens the world of credit, on which New Yorkers' confidence has been based. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 imposed a surveyed grid upon all of Manhattan's varied terrain, in a far- reaching though perhaps topographically insensitive vision. New York, with a population of 96,000 in 1810, surged far beyond its rivals, reaching a population of 1,080,000 in 1860, compared to 566,000 in Philadelphia, 212,000 in Baltimore and 178,000 in Boston. Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. Of greatest importance, it sponsored the Erie Canal which began operations in 1825, forming a continuous water route from New York north to Albany via the Hudson River, then west to Buffalo using the new canal to reach the Great Lakes. It opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest. New York set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes to the highest bidder. Exporters from Britain discovered New York offered the best prices for their goods, and they increasingly ignored Boston and Philadelphia, where the local merchants tried to impose higher markups by avoiding auctions. New York began the world's first regular packet service to England with the Black Ball Line in 1818. By 1830, it dominated the nation's merchant marine. Ambitious shippers reached beyond the natural hinterland to open large-scale coastal trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for export to textile mills in the Northeast and in Europe, and carried manufactured products to the South. By 1830, 40 cents of every dollar the mills paid for cotton went to New York brokers to cover the cost of shipping.Robert G. Albion, \\"New York Port and its disappointed rivals, 1815-1860.\\" Journal of Business and Economic History (1931) 3: 602-629. The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up.Julius Rubin, \\"Canal or railroad? Imitation and innovation in the response to the Erie canal in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston.\\" Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1961): 1-106. Manufacturing was not a major factor in the city's growth in the 19th century‚Äîfactories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities with waterfalls and fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies. In 1792, a group of merchants made the \\"Buttonwood Agreement\\" and began meeting under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street, beginning the New York Stock Exchange, while a yellow fever epidemic that summer sent New Yorkers fleeing north to nearby healthful Greenwich Village. In 1797, Aaron Burr took control of Tammany Hall and used it to win the state's electoral vote in the 1800 presidential election. In 1807, Robert Fulton initiated a steamboat line from New York City to Albany which accelerated the movement of cargo and passengers upriver. Lumber and coal were the main products brought into New York.Balthasar Henry Meyer, and Caroline Elizabeth MacGill, History of Transportation in the United States before 1860 (1917) pp. 161-206 The establishment of regular steam ferries spurred the growth of Brooklyn, which was established as a city in 1834. On September 3, 1821, the Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane caused a storm surge of 13 ft in one hour, leading to widespread flooding south of Canal Street, but few deaths were reported. The hurricane is estimated to have been a Category 3 event and to have made landfall at Jamaica Bay, making it the only hurricane in recorded history to directly strike New York City. In 1824, a riot occurred in Greenwich Village between Irish Protestants and Catholics, after a parade by members of the Orange Order. This was a precursor of the Orange Riots of the 1870s. Immigrants provided a ready resource for those opposing abolition of slavery. These were often led by gangsters from the Bowery and Five Points. On July 7, 1834, a series of riots started, terminating in the destruction of St. Phillip's Negro Church on Center Street and generally terrorizing the Five Points area. In 1831, as the city continued to expand, the University of the City of New York, now New York University, was founded at Washington Square in Greenwich Village. The first of a series of cholera epidemics began in 1832.Charles E. Rosenberg, The cholera years: The United States in 1832, 1849, and 1866 (1962). By 1835, with the epidemic past, Manhattan was in the throes of the first of its building booms. Williamsburgh. Late on December 16, 1835, the Great Fire of New York broke out. The temperature was below zero (F), and gale-force winds were blowing. Firemen, some called from as far away as Philadelphia, were at first helpless to battle the wind-driven fire because of icing lines and pumps. The fire leveled 50 acres (200,000 square meters) in the Financial District. Some merchandise was carried to churches that were thought to be fireproof, but several of these burned anyway. Eventually, the fire was controlled by blowing up buildings in the fire's path. Many of the merchants who lost their stores thought they would be covered by insurance, but the tremendous losses, and, in many cases, the destruction of the insurance company headquarters in the financial district, bankrupted the insurance firms, and much of the loss was not covered. The fires of the period and the increased need for water for industry led to the construction of the Croton Aqueduct water system between 1837 and 1842. The aqueduct brought fresh water from the Croton Dam in northern Westchester County over the High Bridge to the Receiving Reservoir between 79th Street and 86th Street and Sixth and Seventh Avenues. From the Receiving Reservoir water flowed into the Distributing Reservoir, better known as the Croton Reservoir. The aqueduct opened on October 14, 1842, with great celebration. President John Tyler, former presidents John Quincy Adams and Martin van Buren, and New York Governor William H. Seward were among those in attendance. The city's rapid development was again interrupted by the Panic of 1837. The city recovered and by mid-century established itself as the financial and mercantile capital of the western hemisphere. The Great New York City Fire of 1845 destroyed 345 wooden buildings in the Financial District. The Hudson River Railroad (which grew into the New York Central) opened October 3, 1851; it extended the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, the first railroad built in the state, south to New York City. Rise of the immigrant city New York City and the East River, 1848. Bird's-eye view of New York City, 1851 The city and its nearby suburbs grew rapidly for several reasons. The natural harbor at the base of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the New Jersey ports at Newark and Elizabeth provided almost unlimited capacity for trading ships and protection from storms. Not until 1985 did New York lose its place as the busiest port in the world. Other cities, like Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, had good natural harbors, but New York's advantage over other cities of the Eastern Seaboard was that the Hudson River and the Erie Canal formed the only water route through the Appalachian Mountains. The city's cosmopolitan attitude and tolerance of many different cultures encouraged many different types of immigrant groups to settle in the city. Starting in the late 1840s, the city saw increased Irish immigration with the Great Irish Famine and German immigration with the Revolutions of 1848. People who came from Ireland were poor, without knowledge of their new world; once arrived on the docks, unscrupulous landlords offered them squalid tenements which were once houses for middle-class New Yorkers. They crowded into dirty rooms, and the slums of the city became known for high rates of disease. Immigrants were skilled laborers and craftsmen, and Germans who settled in a new neighborhood named \\"Kleindeutschland\\" (Little Germany) and opened many shops where they worked as artisans. Many Irish immigrants were responsible for building the subway and sky-scrapers. Raw unregulated capitalism created large middle, upper-middle and upper classes, but its need for manpower encouraged immigration into the city on an unprecedented scale, with mixed results. The famed \\"melting pot\\" was brought into being, from which multitudes have since arisen in the successful pursuit of the American Dream. In the mid-to-late 19th century, areas of poverty could be found in contrast between rich stretches of lower Broadway, Washington Square, Gramercy Park and Lafayette Street (wealth that would later take up more extravagant residence on Fifth Avenue) and the squalid enclave of Five Points (abject poverty later to occupy the Lower East Side). Tammany Hall's influence increased with its courting of the immigrant Irish vote, leading to the election of the first Tammany mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854, and a trend of consolidation was beginning in the region with the three-year-old City of Williamsburgh joining Brooklyn in 1855, establishing it as America's third largest city.

As a result of the successful profitability of the Salt Tax, it began filtering through the rulings of nations across the world, France, Spain, Russia, England and India were the main regions to follow the Chinese lead. Salt was used as a currency during the Roman Empire and towards the end of their reign, the Romans began monopolising salt in order to fund their war objectives. Salt was such an important commodity during the middle ages that governments would often incorporate the salt trade as a state enterprise.

Impacted regions =India= Today, India is one of the leading producers of salt in the world, coming in third behind the US and China. However, the British implementation of the salt tax in India was one of the highest of its kind. In 1835, the British East India Company implemented the first taxation of salt in India, the British East India Company was taken over by the crown in 1858 as a result of the plentiful revenue.

(1965) THE SALT TAX. British Tax Review. 0. [online]. . Salt tax was collected by over 600 officials at the time. The British salt tax was abolished in 1825 as a result of salt becoming an important mineral in the manufacturing processes evolving during the industrial revolution. Much of the impetus behind the repeal of salt duties came from manufacturers wanting to produce sodium carbonate from common salt through the Leblanc process, rather than extracting it from marine plants such as kelp or barilla. ‚ÄòThe Highland Kelp Proprietors and their Struggle over the Salt and Barilla Duties, 1817-1831‚Äô, Journal of Scottish Historical Studies 26.1+2, 2006, 60-82 Britain‚Äôs salt act of 1882 prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt, a staple in their diet. =China= Salt taxation in China dates back to 300 BC, and today china is one of the largest producers of salt in the world.

The Roman army required salt for their soldiers and horses and often Roman soldiers were paid in salt as it was seen as a valuable currency at the time. The word salary originated from the payment of salt to Roman soldiers and coined the term ‚Äúworth his salt. ‚Äù The Roman government did not follow the influence of the Chinese and did not maintain a monopoly of salt. The Roman government however did not hesitate to control salt prices when they felt necessary, they often subsidised the price of salt to ensure commoners were able to access salt. In order to finance the war, the government did begin manipulating prices of salt in order to raise funds, despite this there remained a low price within the city of Rome. Tax avoidance Avoiding the high taxation of salt, many individuals smuggled salt in order to provide their families with salt and make profits of their own. Private salt trafficking occurred as monopoly salt was more expensive and of lower quality whilst local bandits and rebel leaders thrived on salt smuggling in both China and France. Smuggling salt was a very serious offence, individuals in French history were executed for salt-smuggling whilst in China offenders were often flayed alive.

The Spanish War History . The Revolt consisted of several violent incidents opposing Philip IV‚Äôs taxation policy, the rebellion against the salt tax quickly progressed to a much broader protest against all economic inequalities within the rule of Philip IV‚Äôs reign. The rebellion came to an end in the spring of 1634 as the main leaders of the protest were executed however, Philip IV overlooked the rest of the group and decided to remove his original order concerning the price and ownership of salt in response to the rebellion. The Salt Riot In 1648 the Moscow Uprising, more commonly known as the Salt Riot began as a result of government implementation of a universal salt tax, replacing other taxes, with the intention of replenishing the state treasuryBurg, D. F. (2004) A World History of Tax Rebellions: An Encyclopedia of Tax Rebels, Revolts, and Riots from Antiquity to the Present. Routledge. The price of salt grew exponentially resulting in violent riots within Moscow. The Salt Tax fell mainly on the poorer sections within society, the riot was aggravated due to members of the elite finding ways to evade the tax, resulting in widespread corruption. Examples Notable examples of salt taxation throughout history include: *The French Gabelle, which was a contributing factor to the French Revolution. *The salt tax in China: at various times including that under the Salt Commission of Tang and Yuan China. In China, a state monopoly on salt, also known as the salt gabelle, has existed since 119 B.C and lasted until 2014, making it the world's oldest (and possibly first) state monopoly in the world. By the mid-Tang dynasty, taxes on salt brought in more than half of the government's tax revenue, and continued to be a major factor even in the 20th century.Samuel Adrian M. Adshead. T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004; ), p. 50. *The salt tax in India including that under the British. In India, there had been a tax on salt for hundreds of years but it was greatly increased following the rule of India's provinces by the British East India Company. In salt producing regions such as Orissa, private sale of salt was prohibited, and salt found being transported had to be sold to the British authorities at a fixed price, and, in later years, the production of salt was banned completely. This was done to maintain the high price of British salt by destroying India's long-established tradition of salt-making. In 1858, when Britain took control of the Indian provinces, these taxes remained. Mahatma Gandhi protested this with the Salt March, and it was a contributing factor to the Indian independence movement. Salt played a large role in India's quest for independence. In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs famous Salt Satyagraha took place and led to nonviolent protests throughout the provinces of British India. A 24-day, 240-mile march from Sabarmati Ashram to the coastal village of Dandi, Gandhi was going to, at the journey‚Äôs end, illegally harvest salt without paying tax to the British Crown. Salt was chosen by Gandhi because its taxation was extremely detrimental to the poorest of Indians and, \\"Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.\\" Despite the national influence and international recognition gained by the Salt Satyagraha, the salt tax remained until it was repealed by Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of the Interim Government, in 1946. *A Russian salt tax led to an uprising known as the Moscow uprising of 1648. * The solƒÉrit tax in the Principality of Moldavia during the 16th-18th century.

It is named after James Vincent Hughes, former mayor of City of Oakleigh who lobbied heavily for a new station for the area in the mid-1920s. History Hughesdale began, not as a Melbourne suburb, but as a suburban area of Oakleigh along the railway line between it and Murrumbeena. In the 1880s, due to the presence of the railway the stretch of land attracted some professionals who established substantial homes on large estates. Many of its earliest homes are part of Oakleigh and Murrumbeena's early history. The original township was laid out around Poath Road with small lanes, some cobbled in bluestone. James Vincent Hughes, mayor of City of Oakleigh from 1924 to 1925 lobbied heavily with the Poath Road Railway Station League for a new railway station for the area. In 1924 the League suggested the station be called \\"Hugheston\\", but in February 1925, shortly before the station opened, Victorian Railways decided its name would be \\"Hughesdale\\". A decade later there was a move to rename Poath Road \\"Hughesdale Road\\", but this was rejected by the then Caulfield City Council.Monash Public Library data on street name origins Following the opening of railway station on 28 February 1925 the suburb boomed with a commercial area rapidly springing up near the station along Poath Road and subdivision of sparse land between Murrumbeena and Oakleigh for residential development. Hughesdale Post Office opened on 12 December 1927. Rapid industrialisation and expansion of both Melbourne and Oakleigh in the 1940s saw Hughesdale become entrenched as a Melbourne suburb and commuter zone. Hughesdale inherited the modified grid plan of neighbouring suburbs and the original Victorian era estates were converted to greenfield land eventually making way for affordable working class housing developments. With the opening of Chadstone Shopping Centre in the 1960s, Hughesdale completed its suburban expansion and became the main rail access point for the centre, however it also began a long steep decline in the local commercial area's trading. Hughesdale was defined as a Neighbourhood Activity Centre in the Melbourne 2030 strategy. This and the formation of a local traders' association which rebranded the commercial area \\"Poath Road Village\\" has stimulated a revival in the commercial area. As a result, several mixed use buildings of 2 or more storeys have been developed along Poath Road near the railway station. It became a particular popular area with its mix of cafes and boutique shops. Street names Many street names in the suburb were named after notable British train stations. These include Rugby Road, Euston Road, Crewe Road, Swindon Road, Paddington Road, Clapham Road, Bletchley Road, Willesden Road, Carlisle Crescent, Preston Road, Skipton Road, Dalston Road, Camden Road, Earlstown Road. Among other street names are:Monash City Council street names database * Corr Street: Named after E.J.

Education Hughesdale has three schools - Hughesdale Primary School, Sacred Heart Girls' College and St Anargiri Greek Orthodox College. Hughesdale Primary School, No. 4176, opened in 1924 as Oakleigh South State School and was renamed Hughesdale Primary School in 1938. It had a peak enrolment of 1296 in 1953, at which point some classes held 100 students. The school was threatened with closure by the Kennett government in the 1990s as student numbers fell because of demographic changes, but was saved after a vote at an extraordinary School Council meeting in October 1996. Enrolments have risen steadily since then; in 2005 there were 322 students enrolled. St Anargiri Greek Orthodox College opened in 1983, primarily to satisfy the educational needs of the Greek community of Melbourne's southeastern suburbs. It was initially a Primary to Year 8 school, with 91 students; today it is registered for Primary to Year 12, with enrolments exceeding 740.Oakleigh Greek Orthodox College website Sacred Heart Girls' College was opened in 1957 by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions, who came from the convent in Highgate, Perth, Western Australia. Enrolments for Year 7 are taken from surrounding Catholic Primary Schools. Subject to availability, places are then offered to other students, with preference given to Catholics. The suburb was also the home of Oakleigh Technical School, at the corner of Poath Road and North Road, from 1946 to 1991. The school was demolished in 1993, with the site now occupied by a service station, McDonald's restaurant, a housing estate and a sports ground.

Oakleigh East and Huntingdale became separate suburbs in 1955. The Post Office opened on 15 June 1918 as Oakleigh East. The railway station opened in 1927 as East Oakleigh, and both were renamed with the name Huntingdale in 1955. In 1941, the Huntingdale Golf Club was opened. In 1998, the Australian Bangladesh Islamic Council was founded, and the Huntingdale mosque was opened. In 2014, the Sankat Mochan Kendra centre was opened on North Road. The temple provides free meals to the community, as well as aid and support for women and children in domestic violence situations and for recent Indian migrants to Australia. In 2015, the Huntingdale Mosque was attacked after a brick was thrown through the window.

Structure The Fininvest group is composed of a number of companies, such as Arnoldo Mondadori Editore (one of Italy's leading publishing companies), (a theater in Milan), Alba Servizi Aerotrasporti (a private jet company) and Fininvest Gestione Servizi. Fininvest is the largest shareholder of Mediaset, which is currently the biggest private entertainment competitor in Italy, owning three channels in Italy (Canale 5, Italia 1, Rete 4), two in Spain, the film production company Medusa Film, a digital TV broadcasting network, and many other companies related to TV broadcasting. The deal to sell Mediaset Premium was collapsed in 2016. Fininvest's voting rights on Mediolanum S.p.A. was capped at 9.9999% by Italian Insurance Supervisory Authority despite owning about 36% share capital of the financial conglomerate; the company reverse merger with subsidiary Banca Mediolanum in 2015. Fininvest had a shareholders' pact with Ennio Doris (the pact only bind to 25.5% share each, excess amount of share was not bind), the largest shareholder of Banca Mediolanum, making the pact had an absolute majority in the bank for 51% share capital. On 5 August 2016 Fininvest signed a preliminary agreement to sell 99.93% stake of A.C. Milan to a Chinese private equity fund Sino-Europe Sports. The deal was completed on 13 April 2017. On 15 February 2017 Fininvest announced that they bought an additional 2.9% shares of Mondadori (increased to 53.299%). It was followed by and additional 1.27% shares of Mediaset on 12 May. (Fininvest had also purchased more shares in December 2016, in response to hostile takeover by Vivendi.) Other investments Fininvest owned 0.99% stake in Mediobanca, and was part of the shareholders' pact that owned about 31% stake in the bank in total. Controversies The Berlusconi family does not control the company directly. Instead, its shares are owned by 38 separate companies, all named 'Holding Italiana' followed by a number (1-38), most of which are in turn controlled by Berlusconi. These 'Holding Italiane' have repeatedly come under investigation by the police for various financial and accounting irregularities, slush funds and money-laundering. All of them were created at the end of the 1970s by covert associates of Berlusconi's and received significant investments (several hundreds of millions of euros at today's value) from still unknown sources. Some of their liquidity was even deposited in cash. Much of the documentation of that time relative to the early financial and banking operations of these companies has been lost, in one case in a fire. A report on those matters was commissioned by the general Dipartimento Investigativo Anti-Mafia (Bureau of Anti-Mafia Investigation) of Palermo in the 1990s from a finance expert working at the Bank of Italy, Francesco Giuffrida, to supplement the evidence in a tentative case against Berlusconi and associates for their alleged involvement with the Sicilian Mafia. In 1998 the case was temporarily shelved because of lack of sufficient evidence to go to trial.

When it was rejected by his publisher in 1857, Hugo tried to integrate it into Petites Epop√©es (later La L√©gende des si√®cles), eventually announcing that it would form a companion work, along with Dieu. His intention, apparently, was to invest the storming of the Bastille with a religious significance; after making various efforts, he ceased work on it in 1862 and returned to novels. There are many gaps large and small. Argument Satan is defeated and thrown into the Abyss (\\"Depuis quatre mille ans il tombait dans l'ab√Æme\\"), but Evil is communicated to Man through the agency of Lilith-Isis. She provides three weapons with which Cain murders Abel: The Bronze will become a gauntlet, symbol of War; the Wood will become a gibbet, or crucifix, symbol of Execution; and the Stone will become a prison, symbol of Oppression. This preface is followed by three books, interleaved with otherworldly episodes. Book the First tells the story of Nimrod, a powerful and monstrous king of Judaea. Wandering the Earth, which he has fully dominated and laid waste, he decides to conquer the heavens. For this purpose, he builds a cage and attaches four giant eagles to it, with the meat of dead lions above their heads to draw them upward. With his servant, the eunuch, Nimrod releases the cage from its tethers, and the eagles start towards the heavens. After a journey of one year, moving continuously upwards and finding only an immense blue, Nimrod shoots an arrow into the infinite, and is thrown back to Earth. Book the Second describes the life and death of Jesus. It emphasises the evil of human beings. In \\"Tenebres\\" (II:XXI), Barabbas curses this impure world which liberated him instead of Christ, and claims that we would have chosen to die if offered the choice.

It is the richest archaeological area in Malaysia. These archaeological remains show that there was a Hindu-Buddhist polity here. In Sanskrit the term bhujanga refer to serpent, thus the name itself is roughly translated into \\"Serpent Valley\\". The area consists of ruins that may date more than 2,535 years old. More than fifty ancient tomb temples, called candi (pronounced as \\"chandi\\"), have also been unearthed. The most impressive and well-preserved of these is located in Pengkalan Bujang, Merbok. The Bujang Valley Archaeological Museum is also located here. In the area of Bujang Valley known as Sungai Batu, excavations have revealed jetty remains, iron-smelting sites, and a clay brick monument dating back to AD 110, making it the oldest man-made structure to be recorded in Southeast Asia.New interest in an older Lembah Bujang, 2010/07/25 The local rulers adopted Hindu-Buddhist Indian cultural and political models earlier than those of Kutai in eastern Borneo, in southern Celebes or Tarumanegara in western Java, where remains showing Indian influence have been found dating from the early 5th century. Relics found in the Bujang Valley are now on display at the archaeological museum. Items include inscribed stone caskets and tablets, metal tools and ornaments, ceramics, pottery, and Hindu icons. For the past two decades, students from universities around Malaysia have been invited for research and have done their graduate works at the Valley. Much of the historical links is still vague considering not many of the scriptures and writings survive. Even the temples did not survive the onslaught of age because their wooden roofing has rotted and withered over the past 1,200 years. The museum itself is inadequate and not organised, much of the findings are elsewhere scattered from Museum Negara to Singapore (which once formed a part of Malaysia). Folk stories and oral history also provide place for a magnificent kingdom of jewels and gold. Outside peninsular and insular Southeast Asia, oral history in India suggests the presence of golden chariots and jewels in hidden caves at Bujang Valley and Mount Jerai. Some visitors to the antiquity department at Muzium Negara has eyewitness accounts of magnificent objects such as a 10-feet-tall Raja Bersiung Throne and various idols and items from the Valley. On 1 December 2013, it was reported that, a 1,200-year-old Hindu Temple at the site, identified as Candi No. 11, had been demolished by a land developer. Candi 11 was one of the most ancient of the old Kedah kingdom and was amongst 17 registered candi. In the face of public criticism, the Kedah State Government sought to deflect blame by claiming that it was powerless to do anything because the land was privately owned and further, that the site had not been gazetted as a historical site. After the controversy, the Tourism and Heritage Ministry has agreed to consider gazetting the Bujang Valley as heritage site Before the 1970s, the research in Bujang Valley was done by western archaeologists, the most prominent ones include H.G. Quaritch Wales, Dorothy Wales, and Alastair Lamb. After the 1970s, local archaeologists were trained to continue the research there. With the strong support of the Malaysian Government, excavations and reconstructions of sites were done in Bujang Valley by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and University of Malaysia in collaboration with The Department of Museums and Antiquity. The most prominent local archaeologist who did research in the Bujang Valley was Nik Hassan Shuhaimi Nik Abdul Rahman (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) who wrote and publish countless books and articles on this topic. He introduced a periodisation of the history of Bujang Valley as well as a theory which explains about the process of indigenisation of the Indian Culture which formed the socio-economic make up of the polity. Other earlier local archaeologist who significantly contributed to the research of Bujang Valley include Leong Sau Heng (University of Malaya), Mohd Supian Sabtu (University of Malaya), Kamarudin Zakaria (Museums Department), Zulkifli Jaafar (Museums Department), and Zuliskandar Ramli (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia). After 2008, The Centre for Global Archaeological Research (CGAR) from University Sains Malaysia, led by Mohd Mokhtar Saidin explored a new archaeological complex which reveals dozens of new sites, said to be dated from 2nd Century C.E. Presently, a number of new researchers are being trained in local and foreign universities to continue the research in Bujang Valley in the future. They were trained in a number important sub-disciplines of archaeology which include Epigraphy, Palaeography, Hindu-Buddhist Architecture, Metallurgy, historical archaeology, Maritime Archaeology and Palinology which will contribute immensely to future research. In 2014 candi 11 was demolished by the developer for building of the housing project, the issue was highlighted by media, as the result of that the government now employed a security guard to safeguard some candis particularly the Candi Batu Pahat at museum site. The Bujang Valley is currently in the process of being nominated by Malaysia into the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2013. In 2017, the government announced that they will make more research and conservation efforts in the valley to preserve its outstanding universal value. The site's inclusion to the world heritage list is backed by diplomats from India, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, Japan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Laos, Brunei, Papua New Guinea, Maldives, and Sri Lanka.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht0lg_wWFi8http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/08/06/ministry- more-studies-before-unesco-push-for-bujang- valley/http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/bujang-valley-should-be-recognised- as-unesco-world-heritage-site/ History Built in 6th century A.D, Candi Bukit Batu Pahat is the most well-known ancient Hindu temple found in Bujang Valley, Kedah, Malaysia. Claudius Ptolemaeus (Greek: ŒöŒªŒ±œçŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ Œ†œÑŒøŒªŒµŒºŒ±·øñŒøœÇ; c. 90 ‚Äì c. 168), known in English as Ptolemy, was a Greek geographer, astronomer, and astrologer who had written about Golden Chersonese, which indicates trade with India and China has existed since the 1st century AD., As early as the 1st century AD, Southeast Asia was the place of a network of coastal city- states, the centre of which was the ancient Khmer Funan kingdom in the south of what is now Vietnam. This network encompassed the southern part of the Indochinese peninsula and the western part of the Indonesian archipelago. These coastal cities had a continuous trade as well as tributary relation with China from very early period, at the same time being in constant contact with Indian traders. They seem to have shared a common indigenous culture. Gradually, the rulers of the western part of Indonesia adopted Indian cultural and political models e.g. proof of such Indian influence on Indonesian art in the 5th century, i. e. an Amaravati Buddha statue found in southern Sulawesi and a Sanskrit inscription found east of Jakarta. Three inscriptions found in Palembang (South Sumatra) and on Bangka Island, written in a form of Malay and in an alphabet derived from the Pallava script, are proof that these \\"Indonesians\\" had definitely adopted Indian models while maintaining their indigenous language and social system. These inscriptions reveal the existence of a Dapunta Hyang (lord) of Srivijaya who led an expedition against his enemies and who curses those who will not obey his law. Being on the maritime route between China and South India, the Malay peninsula was involved in this trade The Bujang Valley, being strategically located at the northwest entrance of the Strait of Malacca as well as facing the Bay of Bengal, was continuously frequented by Chinese and south Indian traders. Such was proven by the discovery of trade ceramics, sculptures, inscriptions and monuments dated from the 5th to 14th century CE. The Bujang Valley was continuously administered by different thalassocratical powers including Funan, Srivijaya and Majapahit before the trade declined. Kedah inscriptions Figure of a dancer carved in high relief found at Batu Lintang, south of Kedah Nandi found in the vicinity of site 4 near the Bujang Valley One of the six stone boxes, which were found buried beneath Candi Bukit Batu Pahat In Kedah there are remains showing Buddhist and Hindu influences which has been known for about a century now from the discoveries reported by Col. Low and has recently been subjected to a fairly exhaustive investigation by Dr. Quaritch Wales. Dr. Wales investigated no fewer than thirty sites round about Kedah. An inscribed stone bar, rectangular in shape, bears the ye-dharmma formula in Pallava script of the 7th century, thus proclaiming the Buddhist character of the shrine near the find-spot (site I) of which only the basement survives. It is inscribed on three faces in Pallava script of the 6th century, possibly earlier. Except for the Cherok Tokkun Inscription which was engraved on a large boulder, other inscriptions discovered in Bujang Valley are comparatively small in size and probably were brought in by Buddhist pilgrimage or traders. UNESCO Proposal UNESCO made a report in 1987 endorsing the site.https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000078585 In 2014, some tombs of Bujang were destroyed by an urban developer, causing an international outcry against attacks on cultural heritage.https://www.bbncommunity.com/prehistoric- temple-ruin-site-applied-unesco-heritage-status-furtively-destroyed/ In 2017, the government of Malaysia announced that more research on the site is still needed, thus excluding it from the Malaysian tentative list. The government also said that Bujang's Merbok Museum and Pengkalan Bujang held historical significance to the site.https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/08/06/ministry- more-studies-before-unesco-push-for-bujang-valley/ Books * Michel Jacq- Hergoualc'h, The Malay Peninsular, Crossroads of the Maritime Silk Road, 2002, Brill, Leiden, * Wolters, O.

The causeway consists of three separate two-lane bridge spans, and two- man-made causeway islands between them. The entire causeway facility is owned by Lee County and operated by the Lee County Department of Transportation. The entire causeway is three miles long from end to end, and currently has a $6 toll in effect for island-bound vehicles only. The bridges are not individually named, and are simply referred to as bridges A, B, and C. The islands are also named A and B. Both series begin from the mainland side. History The old drawbridge next to the current Bridge A as seen prior to demolition As early as 1912, automobile ferries serviced Sanibel Island from the mainland at Punta Rassa. The idea of building a bridge from the mainland to the island was highly controversial amongst the early residents of the island, as many thought a bridge would ruin the beauty and isolated feel of the island. Although, one of the largest proponents of building a bridge was island resident Hugo Lindgren who saw the island's potential and tried to convince Lee County to build a bridge. Despite the opinions of the islanders, it was clear that the ferries were insufficient by the mid 1950s as demand increased leading to long lines of vehicles waiting to cross the bay. Wildfires on the island in 1955 further convinced the county to build a bridge as it would improve access to the island for firefighters. An early proposal would have had a bridge running from Point Ybel (where Sanibel Lighthouse is currently located) to the mainland, since it was the shortest route. Although the current route was ultimately selected due to the bay being shallower and two causeway island could be created by dredging. While Bailey Road was then selected as the terminus of the bridge on the island, Hugo Lindgren granted the county right-of-way through his property on the bay, which the county accepted. Construction on the entire causeway and the three original bridges lasted 15 months and cost $2.73 million. It was the last major project designed by Hector F.J. Estrup, Civil Engineer, owner of Caribbean Engineers. The Sanibel Causeway was completed and opened for traffic on May 26, 1963. Due to the causeway, Sanibel Island experienced major growth in the early 1970s leading to Sanibel's incorporation into Lee County's third city, which took place on November 5, 1974. Former congressman and CIA director Porter Goss served as Sanibel's first mayor. By the early 1990s, the original bridges began showing signs of rapid deterioration due to the bay's salt water, prompting the county made to make major repairs. As a result, Lee County briefly proposed the idea of replacing the bridges with a single four-lane high-span bridge. This idea was abandoned due to opposition from island residents. Further repairs were made in 1997 as rapid deterioration from overall lack of maintenance and salt water corrosion continued. In 2001, the county made plans to replace Bridges B and C, and make major repairs to Bridge A (the drawbridge). In early 2003, during a routine inspection, severe cracks were discovered underneath a deck section on Bridge B. After this discovery, all three of the bridges were very closely monitored, and the damaged section was braced with additional steel pilings. Bridge B's speed limit was temporarily lowered to , and the rest of the causeway's speed limit was lowered to . A temporary 10-ton weight limit was put in place. Lee County determined that the deck section needed to be completely replaced as soon as possible. After extensive preparations, the causeway was shut down all day on January 20, 2003. The deck section was replaced with a steel grate section. The replacement was completed quickly, and the causeway re-opened ahead of schedule. After this turn of events, Lee County reexamined it original plan for rehabilitating Bridge A (the drawbridge), and concluded that all three of the bridges needed to be replaced as soon as possible. The Toll Plaza Once it was decided to replace the drawbridge, a debate on replacing it with another drawbridge versus a high-span bridge commenced. The county wanted a high-span, while a number of Sanibel residents wanted another drawbridge. Shortly before construction was set to begin on the high-span bridge, the city filed a lawsuit against the Lee County in an attempt to stop construction. Sanibel claimed that Lee County did not maintain the bridges properly, and used the toll revenue for other road projects. Lee County then filed a counter lawsuit, claiming Sanibel was interfering with construction. A second lawsuit against Lee County was filed by a group of Sanibel residents who created a non-profit organization called \\"Save Our Bay, Inc.\\" All of the lawsuits delayed construction, and were eventually dismissed. On August 13, 2004, the area was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 hurricane. The causeway received only minor damage and was very carefully inspected before Sanibel residents were permitted to return to the island. Construction of the current bridges commenced in May 2004. The three-dollar toll was increased to six dollars in November 2004 to finance construction. Construction on the current spans lasted three years, and cost $137 million. An official grand-opening ceremony for the current bridges was held on September 8, 2007, which was the day the current Bridge C opened (even though the current Bridges A and B opened prior to September 8). The original bridges were later demolished, and their remains were sunk into the water to create a number of artificial reefs in the San Carlos Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The bridges Bridge A Bridge A =Bridge A= Bridge A is the bridge closest to the mainland at Punta Rassa. Bridge A is tall and stands as the tallest bridge in Lee County. The bridge previously holding this record was the nearby Matanzas Pass Bridge, which is tall. The original Bridge A was a high drawbridge. The current Bridge A finally opened for traffic on June 28, 2007, along with the current toll plaza. The Sanibel- Captiva Optimists Club had held a raffle for the opportunity to be the operator of the drawbridge's machinery for its final opening. A private ceremony was held the day after the current bridge opened to commemorate the drawbridge's final opening. Seasonal Sanibel residents Bob and Ana Finks won the raffle, and they also got to keep the operating lever from the drawbridge's control room as part of the prize. Bridge B Original Bridge B's remaining piling =Bridge B= Bridge B is the middle bridge, and is also the shortest of the three bridges. The current Bridge B opened for traffic on April 11, 2007, making it the first of the current spans to open. The current Bridge B was built ten feet taller than the original Bridge B to help reduce corrosion from salt spray, which was one of the major factors in the deterioration of the old bridge. Unlike the other two bridges, Bridge B is a low-level bridge, and has no navigation channel passing underneath. The first few sets of piling from the original bridge on the south shore remain today. While the county initially planned to demolish the entire structure, a grassroots campaign was launched by local fisherman to have part of the span left intact for a fishing pier similar to the former spans of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and the Overseas Highway. Despite the campaign initially succeeding, plans to install new deck sections on top of the pilings for the pier were scrapped in early 2010 due to budget cuts. Bridge C =Bridge C= Bridge C is the closest bridge to Sanibel Island, and is also the longest of the three bridges. Bridge C's vertical clearance over its navigation channel is . The current Bridge C opened for traffic on September 8, 2007, making it the last of the current spans to open. Similar to Bridge B, the current Bridge C was also constructed ten feet taller than the original bridge. Causeway Islands Park Causeway Islands Park Causeway Island B The causeway's islands were dredged from the San Carlos Bay when the original bridges were built. Since the completion of the current bridges, the islands have been operated as Causeway Islands Park by Lee County Parks and Recreation. The islands are referred to as Island A and Island B, and they serve as public beaches. Island B includes restroom facilities on each side of the road. The islands have always been a popular area among beachgoers for windsurfing and kitesurfing. Media references In Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road (2006), comedian Ron White makes a reference to the old Sanibel Causeway bridge when he said he was pulled over for driving in a 5-mile-per-hour zone on one of the bridges. The speed limit was indeed reduced to on one of the bridges after speculation that the bridges were severely damaged from corrosion.

He wrote a number of book-length polemical poems including Autogeddon, Falling for a Dolphin and Whale Nation, which in 1988 was described by Philip Hoare as \\"the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling.\\" Williams invented his idiosyncratic \\"documentary/investigative poetry\\" style which he put to good purpose bringing a diverse range of environmental and political matters to public attention. His last published work, American Porn was a critique of the American political establishment and the election of President Donald Trump; its publication date was the date of Trump's inauguration (20 January 2017). In June 2015 he published a book-length investigative poem about the \\"Muslim Gandhi\\", Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, \\"Badshah Khan\\". As well as being a playwright and screenwriter, Williams appeared in a number of independent and Hollywood films and was among the celebrity guests in the last episode of season 4 of Friends, '\\"The One With Ross's Wedding\\"'. He played Prospero in Derek Jarman's The Tempest (1979) and appeared in several \\"arthouse\\" films, including Orlando (1992), as well as Hollywood movie Basic Instinct 2 (2006). Al Pacino played the part of a Williams fan in a spoof arts documentary, Every Time I Cross the Tamar I Get into Trouble. Williams also wrote lyrics, collaborating with Marianne Faithfull among others. Williams was a keen naturalist and discovered a new species of honey-producing wasp in the Argentine pampas, an event he recorded in a book of poems called Forbidden Fruit. Williams was a magician and a member of The Magic Circle. He wrote a TV play called What the Dickens! about Charles Dickens's penchant for performing magic shows. Bob Hoskins taught him fire eating. When he went to demonstrate his new found talent to then girlfriend Jean Shrimpton, he accidentally set himself alight on her doorstep. Williams was a leading activist in the London squatting scene in the 1970s and ran a squatters \\"estate agency\\" called the \\"Ruff Tuff Cream Puff\\". In 1977 he and a couple of hundred fellow squatters established the \\"state\\" of Frestonia in Notting Hill and declared independence from Britain. The then Shadow Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, wrote to express his support and Williams was appointed UK Ambassador. Frestonia lasted almost a decade and had its own institutions and postage stamps. Williams spray-painted graffiti on the walls of Buckingham Palace as a protest against the Queen signing Michael X's death warrant while there was no capital punishment in the UK. In the early 1970s, his agitational graffiti were a feature on the walls of the then low-rent end of London's Notting Hill district. The final paragraph of Williams' New York Times obituary summed up his philosophy: \\"If poetry isn't revolutionary, it's nothing,\\" he told Saira Viola from the web publication Gonzo Today in 2015. \\"Poetry is heightened language, and language exists to effect change, not to be a tranquilizer.\\" Early life and career John Henley Heathcote-Williams was born in Helsby, Cheshire. After his schooldays at Eton, he changed his name to Heathcote Williams. His father, Harold Heathcote-Williams, was a barrister (appointed Queen's Counsel)https://www.ft.com/content/2ef92fbe-623a-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1 and his mother, (Margaret) Julian (n√©e Henley) a clergyman's daughter.https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jul/02/heathcote-williams- obituary His first book was The Speakers (1964), an account of life at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park, written when he was just 22 years old. The Speakers attracted enthusiastic reviews, with Harold Pinter describing it as \\"brilliant... a remarkable achievement and very, very funny\\". In 1974, it was adapted for the stage by the Joint Stock Theatre Company. His first full- length play, AC/DC (1970), first staged at the Royal Court Theatre, is a critique of the burgeoning mental health industry; it includes a thinly veiled attack on 1960s alternative society, and the proponent of the anti-psychiatry movement, R.D. Laing. Its production did not, however, appear to impede cordial relations between the two men in later years. AC/DC won the London Evening Standards Most Promising Play Award. It also received the 1972 John Whiting Award for being \\"a new and distinctive development in dramatic writing with particular relevance to contemporary society.\\" It was described in the Times Literary Supplement in a front-page review by Charles Marowitz as \\"the first play of the 21st century.\\" AC/DC was produced in New York City in 1971 at the Chelsea Theater Center at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Other plays include the one-act monologue Hancock's Last Half Hour, The Local Stigmatic, The Immortalist and the impossible to categorise Remember The Truth Dentist ‚Äì an early effort, again at the Royal Court, directed by Ken Campbell. The inaugural issue of the London Review of Books included an effusive profile by fellow Etonian Francis Wyndham titled The Magic of Heathcote Williams. Poetry Williams had often been reluctant to co-operate in the promotion of his work commercially, refusing, for example, to go to the US to promote AC/DC, to the despair of his publishers. The only book signing tour he has ever done \\"enough,\\" he complained, \\"to cripple a rock-star\\"was the result of relentless pressure from Jonathan Cape's PR department. Energetic publicity efforts on Williams' behalf, the responsibility of Cape's Polly Samson, enabled him to reach a wider audience for his trilogy of book-length poems on environmental themes. Each of them was the result of detailed research and featured many photographs. Written some years earlier as visionary propaganda, they had otherwise been gathering dust in a corner of his then agent's office. The North American rights for the poem Whale Nation (1988) were sold at the Frankfurt Book Fair for $100,000; Williams donated his share of the advance to environmental organizations. According to another writer on this subject, Philip Hoare in 2008, it is an \\"epic plea for the future of the whale, a hymn to the beauty, majesty and intelligence of the largest mammals on earth, as well as a prayer for their protection... Whale Nation became the most powerful argument for the newly instigated worldwide ban on whaling, and for a moment, back in 1988, it seemed as if a shameful chapter in human history might finally be drawing to a close.\\". Whale Nation was followed by Sacred Elephant (1989), which deals with the devastation of the natural environment, and Autogeddon (1991), which characterises the motor car's global death toll as, \\"A humdrum holocaust, the third world war nobody bothered to declare.\\" Each poem was made into a film by BBC Television, Autogeddon being performed by Jeremy Irons. Williams' public readings of Whale Nation reduced some members of the audience to tears. His recordings for Naxos Records, which include readings from the Buddhist scriptures, Dante and the Bible, have won awards. In 2011, Williams began a new collaboration with Roy Hutchins, who had performed Whale Nation, Autogeddon and Falling for a Dolphin in the 1980s. The result was Zanzibar Cats, a performance of recent short poems. In What's on Stage, the reviewer Michael Coveney wrote: \\"These wonderful poems seize on political absurdity, planetary destruction and social injustice with relish and delight, as well as great erudition and verbal dexterity.\\" In December 2011, Huxley Scientific Press published a collection of poems by Williams on science and nature entitled Forbidden Fruit. The title poem is an elegy for mathematician, computer pioneer, and wartime codebreaker Alan Turing, the centenary of whose birth occurred in 2012. The Beat poet Michael McClure called the book \\"a collection of inspirations ‚Ä¶ as rich and dark as wasp honey\\". At the end of 2012, Huxley Scientific Press published Shelley at Oxford: Blasphemy, Book-Burning, and Bedlam, written by Williams during the bicentenary of Shelley's expulsion from Oxford for atheism, aged 19. Williams regularly published new work on the digital, resurrected International Times. Royal Babylon: The Criminal Record of the British Monarchy was made into a video installation by the filmmaker collective Handsome Dog, to coincide with Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee, and his poems Lord of the Drones: The President and the White House Fly, Hollywoodland, and Was Moby Dick Behind 9/11? (2012) are currently being edited into a trilogy‚ÄîAutopsy: The American Empire Dissected. In June 2015, 'Badshah Khan: Islamic Peace Warrior' was published by Thin Man Press. Williams's \\"poetic investigation\\" reviews the life and legacy of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (1890‚Äì1988). Williams's riposte to the election of President Donald Trump, American Porn, was published by Thin Man Press on 20 January, Trump's inauguration day. Political pamphlets In 2016, Williams responded to contemporary political events with a pamphlet in the Swiftean tradition, an excoriating commentary on Boris Johnson entitled 'The Blond Beast of Brexit: a Study in Depravity'. The pamphlet was described by a review as \\"a 20,000-word collage of the most maniacal, hypocritical, and cruel things the former mayor has ever said or done\\". Later that year, an updated and expanded version, 'Brexit Boris: From Mayor to Nightmare', was published by Public Reading Rooms.

Leading the life of a would-be recluse, he received prolonged tuition from the 'New Ruralist' artist Graham Ovenden, at the latter's home on the edge of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall. The result was an out-pouring of hundreds of canvases, including satirical pastiches of the works of Van Gogh, Claude Monet, Stanley Spencer, Lucian Freud and others. He also produced a number of sculptures of great piles of books, tottering and damp-swollen, elaborately hand-carved in wood. Song- writing Williams's occasional but typically anarchistic forays into the realm of lyric-writing include the uncategorisable and unreleased \\"Wrinkly Bonk\\", and \\"Why D'Ya Do It?\\", a sexually explicit exploration of carnal jealousy, for Marianne Faithfull's 1979 classic album Broken English. Williams's words were enough to cause a walk-out by the female workers on EMI's production line. Magazines Williams was for a time associate editor of the literary journal Transatlantic Review, as well as being one of those responsible for the alternative sex paper Suck. He was a frequent contributor to the London underground paper International Times during the 1970s, to the radical vegetarian magazine Seed and to The Fanatic, issues of which would appear sporadically and provocatively in different formats and various countries of Western Europe. In 1974, he launched his own mimeographed underground newspaper, The Sunday Head. It was published from his home in Notting Hill Gate, London at the time when he was also the impresario for Albion Free State's Meat Roxy, a series of music, dance and poetry events held in a squatted, redundant bingo hall near the Portobello market. An anthology of his tracts and manifestos from this period, Severe Joy, was announced by his then publisher but for some reason never actually appeared. A sampling did appear in a bi-lingual, limited edition titled Manifestoes from the Rotterdam- based Cold Turkey Press as well as in the Manchester literary magazine Wordworks in 1975. Film The theme of Williams' early one-act play The Local Stigmatic is fame and its adverse consequences, performed by Al Pacino at an Off-Off-Broadway venue, with financial assistance from Jon Voight. In later years the film version became known as 'Pacino's secret project,' his debut as a director. It was finally released as part of the Pacino: An Actor's Vision box-set in 2007. Williams' own film performances include Prospero in Derek Jarman's version of The Tempest (1979), Wish You Were Here (1987), Stormy Monday (1988), Sally Potter's Orlando (1992), The Browning Version (1994), The Steal (1995), Blue Juice (1995) with Catherine Zeta Jones, Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis (1997), The Odyssey (1997), Cousin Bette (1998), The Legend of 1900 (1998) and Alice in Wonderland (1999). Williams also appeared in Hotel (2001) with Salma Hayek, which he also co-wrote, and enjoyed a steady stream of bit-parts in big-budget Hollywood productions, such as the ill-fated Basic Instinct 2 (2006) and City of Ember (2008). Television The National Theatre of Frestonia: by day it was the People's Hall, focal point for the independence movement. It staged Williams's one-act play The Immortalist, in which David Rappaport interviewed a 278-year-old man. In a later Institute of Contemporary Arts production the TV personality Joan Bakewell played the incredulous interviewer. Williams' contact with television overlapped with his activity in community politics. In a 1970s experiment by the BBC in public access television Williams, in the guise of a tree, spoke for fifteen minutes on the virtues of life unencumbered by the rule of Westminster. Albion Free State was his name for a utopian vision of an England free from government and bosses. Williams was one of 120 or so squatters who had commandeered a small chunk of West London, just about visible from BBC Television Centre itself. Frestonia, as the extensive squat was known, had declared itself independent of Great Britain. The actor David Rappaport was proclaimed Foreign Minister and Williams served as ambassador to the UK. Postage stamps were issued bearing the face of Guy the Gorilla instead of the Queen; they made no mention of currency, but simply carried the legend, God Will Provide. The project, which exasperated the authorities for years, provoked much litigation before the bulldozers were finally able to move in. Williams later applied his abilities as a conjurerhe was a member of The Magic Circleto come up with a Christmas play based on Charles Dickens's enthusiasm for performing magic shows for his friends and extended family. What the Dickens! depicted the novelist, with the likes of Thomas Carlyle and Thackeray standing by to assist, as he manipulated \\"airy nothings\\" and assorted props to the delighted squeals of foundling children from the Thomas Coram Home. The production featured a young Ben Cross as Dickens, with a supporting cast that included Dinsdale Landen and Kenneth Haigh. It was broadcast by Channel 4 in Christmas 1983, with a repeat screening the following Christmas. In July 1988 Williams made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark, alongside Petra Kelly, James Lovelock, C.W. Nicol and others. In March 1993, Williams was the subject of a half-hour spoof arts documentary, a meditation on fame and fandom titled Every Time I Cross the Tamar I Get into Trouble. Screened by Channel Four in its Without Walls slot, the BFI film database characterises the film thus: \\"An account of Heathcote William's work, and Al Pacino's obsession with his writing. Includes an interview with Harold Pinter and footage from Pacino's film The Local Stigmatic.\\" The half-hour film was presented by the comedian and musician John Dowie, an avid collector of Williams memorabilia. Personal life Williams lived in Oxford with Diana Senior. They had two daughters and three grandchildren. Williams also had a son, Charlie, born in 1989, from a previous relationship with novelist and journalist Polly Samson. In 1994 Samson married Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, who became Charlie's adoptive father. Williams and Samson had become involved with each other during the publication of Whale Nation, Samson being responsible for publicising what she succeeded in turning into a best-selling volume despite its author's reluctance to promote his work (see ¬ßPoetry, above). Williams's personal life was always turbulent. An affair with the model Jean Shrimpton resulted in the writer setting himself alight on her doorstep. Whether this was intentional or the upshot of a magical stunt gone wrongWilliams at the time was an ardent fire-eateris unknown. Although at the time, it was assumed Shrimpton had ended the relationship, in her autobiography published in the early 1990s, Shrimpton asserted that it was Williams who walked out on her. Illness and death Williams died on 1 July 2017 in Oxford, of kidney failure after a long stay in hospital for a chest infection.

Among his accomplishments were: * taking 283 wickets in the English season of 1888 for 11.27 runs each. This tally was 69 wickets ahead of Ted Peate's 1882 record, and has been bettered only by Tom Richardson in 1895 and Tich Freeman in 1928 and 1933. * taking 314 wickets in all matches in 1888. * taking 106 wickets in twelve matches in the Australian season of 1887/88 ‚Äì a record for any bowler in Australia * taking 17 wickets for 50 runshttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/f/3/f3065.html against An England Eleven at Hastings in 1888. Of these 17, 14 were bowled, two lbw and one stumped. * being the first Australian bowler to reach 100 wickets in Test matches. * his 12 for 87 against England in his record season of 1887/1888 is still the best bowling analysis for a Test at the SCG. * the only bowler to take 50 wickets in their first six Test matches. Turner was born in Bathurst, New South Wales. His early adventures in first-class cricket were unsuccessful, but in 1886/87, when he moved from Bathurst to Sydney to become a banker, his skill developed to a remarkable degree with 70 first-class wickets at 7.68 runs each from just seven matches. In two games against Victoria he took eighteen wickets for 184 runs, but it was his excellence against Alfred Shaw's touring side that brought Turner acclaim in the English cricket community. In the first Test, after England were put in on a very sticky pitch, Turner took 6/15, and in the second his combined figures were nine for 93. The following year, Turner, with the Australian pitches already notorious for being difficult after rain, he had a strong season in the wet weather of a La Ni√±a summer, his best performances outside the Test including: * 10 for 45 v Arthur Shrewsbury's XI; * 16 for 79 in a second match v Arthur Shrewsbury's XI; * 11 for 119 v G.F. Vernon's XI at the MCG; * 5 for 17 in first innings for New South Wales v Victoria at the MCG. In the English summer of 1888, along with John Ferris, Turner was prolific. However, he took ten for 53 in Australia's only win in the three-Test series at Lord's and took 9 for 15 versus An England Eleven at Stoke-on-Trent. He showed ability as a batsman, scoring a maiden century at The Oval in the first game of the tour. Turner, \\"The Terror\\" After three extremely prolific seasons, Turner could not maintain his productivity. With El Ni√±o holding sway, the wickets in Australia in 1888/89 were unresponsive and Turner took only 29 wickets in six games, and even fewer the following season. However, still regarded as the best bowler for English conditions, Turner did not disappoint the selectors in 1890, taking 179 first-class wickets (215 in all games) but being unable to break England's dominance of Test cricket at the time. In the following few Australian seasons, Turner continued to do well even if too little cricket was played for him to equal his records of the late 1880s. In the relatively dry English summer of 1893, Turner still was Australia's leading bowler with 148 wickets at 13.63, but the absence of Ferris and business commitments were slowly taking their toll on him. During this tour his speed was measured electronically at Woolwich Arsenal and timed at 81 feet per second, or 55 miles an hour. p. 2. When England next toured in 1894/95, Turner equalled Fred Spofforth's record of 94 Test wickets in the Second Test at Melbourne on 31 December 1894, two days after the England bowler Johnny Briggs. The three men briefly held the record together, but Turner missed the Third Test at Adelaide and Briggs overtook him. Briggs became the first man to claim 100 Test wickets in the Fourth Test at Sydney on 1 February 1895, Turner being the second on 4 February in his last Test match.p44, Bill Frindall, The Guinness Book of Cricket Facts and Feats, Guinness Publishing, 1996 Turner had the unique (in Test cricket) distinction of having Bobby Peel stumped for a pair on a sticky wicket in Sydney. His record in this Test series was, actually, his best since 1888, but two years later his banking business required him to move to Queensland, where he was not able then to continue playing cricket apart from one match for his benefit as late as the 1909/10 season ‚Äì when he was 47 ‚Äì that was not successful. Many batsmen who played against him considered Turner without peer. He bowled right-hand medium pace with a relatively long and rhythmic run-up and a beautiful delivery that never aimed to exploit even his rather limited height of five feet nine inches (175 centimetres). He could vary his pace a great deal, and combined this with an accurate length and a sharply-turning off-break that made him very difficult on rain-affected wickets. This unplayability on treacherous pitches earned him the nickname \\"Terror\\" Turner. However, Turner continued to do service to the game in Australia as an administrator right through the early twentieth century. He commented, notably, on how greatly the game in Australia changed after the era in which he played due to a drier climate and improved pitch preparation (and also covering of pitches in Shield matches from the 1930s), which made Australian pitches almost impossible for bowlers of his type and led to reliance on leg spin. On 15 January 2007, Turner was named in the NSW Cricket Team All Time Twelve, as part of the celebrations of 150 years of the NSW Cricket Team. Charles Turner's ashes are now in the Council Chambers of Bathurst and a plaque at the Bathurst Oval recognises his services to both cricket and to Bathurst. His father Charles Turner and his father before him, Robert Turner arrived from England as a free settler from Leeds, England owned and ran several hotels in Bathurst including the Royal Hotel which still stands.

It is regarded as a humane means of immobilizing small animals being observed in experiments, and while once common in commercial slaughtering is no longer practiced in some developed countries on animals intended for the human food supply due to the risks of embedded metal fragments and general spread of disease. Current United States and European Union regulations prohibit importation of beef from cows pithed due to risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \\"mad cow\\") disease. It is, however, encouraged for animals in emergency or specific disease control situations where the meat will not be consumed. Use =Commercial slaughter= An animal is first immobilized through captive bolt stunning. A pithing cane or rod is then inserted into the stunning hole and pushed to its full length, the rod then remains locked in the hole and is disposed of with the animal. Double pithing destroys the spinal cord, thus killing the animal, and also may reduce the reflex kicking which occurs at stunning, and so contribute to the safety of the slaughterman. This method is also used when dealing with diseased animals in the case of epidemic or notifiable disease. =Disease control= Pithing is viewed as a humane way of killing an animal that is going to be slaughtered or destroyed for disease control or humane reasons, for example an animal which is severely injured in an accident. When animals must be killed humanely on farm for disease control purposes or in an emergency situation, disposable pithing rods allow the slaughterman to adopt best practice. They ensure humane slaughter, seal the stunning hole reducing bleeding and so provide good biosecurity protection and eliminate the need to bleed out the animal. Disposable devices will help to ensure that the rods do not represent a risk of disease spread, and that they remain with the animal when it is disposed. In the case of outbreak of notifiable or epidemic disease, government agencies and welfare organisations may develop contingency plans. \\"Planned stocking\\" may be necessary to ensure that rods are available at short notice in the event of a disease outbreak. =In science= Pithing is also a procedure used in laboratories to immobilize a biological specimen, for instance a frog. A needle is inserted through the rear base of the skull and wiggled, destroying the brain. The specimen remains living due to respiration through the skin without cerebral control, allowing it to be dissected while observing such living physiology as its beating heart and expansion and contraction of its lungs without causing further pain.

The name Lustre is a portmanteau word derived from Linux and cluster. Lustre file system software is available under the GNU General Public License (version 2 only) and provides high performance file systems for computer clusters ranging in size from small workgroup clusters to large-scale, multi-site systems. Since June 2005, Lustre has consistently been used by at least half of the top ten, and more than 60 of the top 100 fastest supercomputers in the world, including the world's No. 1 ranked TOP500 supercomputer in June 2020, Fugaku, as well as previous top supercomputers such as Titan and Sequoia. Lustre file systems are scalable and can be part of multiple computer clusters with tens of thousands of client nodes, tens of petabytes (PB) of storage on hundreds of servers, and more than a terabyte per second (TB/s) of aggregate I/O throughput. This makes Lustre file systems a popular choice for businesses with large data centers, including those in industries such as meteorology, simulation, oil and gas, life science, rich media, and finance. By Peter Braam, November 10, 2007 The I/O performance of Lustre has widespread impact on these applications and has attracted broad attention.  History  The Lustre file system architecture was started as a research project in 1999 by Peter J. Braam, who was a staff of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at the time. Braam went on to found his own company Cluster File Systems in 2001, starting from work on the InterMezzo file system in the Coda project at CMU. Lustre was developed under the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative Path Forward project funded by the United States Department of Energy, which included Hewlett-Packard and Intel. In September 2007, Sun Microsystems acquired the assets of Cluster File Systems Inc. including its intellectual property. Sun included Lustre with its high- performance computing hardware offerings, with the intent to bring Lustre technologies to Sun's ZFS file system and the Solaris operating system. In November 2008, Braam left Sun Microsystems, and Eric Barton and Andreas Dilger took control of the project. In 2010 Oracle Corporation, by way of its acquisition of Sun, began to manage and release Lustre. In December 2010, Oracle announced that they would cease Lustre 2.x development and place Lustre 1.8 into maintenance-only support, creating uncertainty around the future development of the file system. Following this announcement, several new organizations sprang up to provide support and development in an open community development model, including Whamcloud, Open Scalable File Systems, Inc. (OpenSFS), EUROPEAN Open File Systems (EOFS) and others. By the end of 2010, most Lustre developers had left Oracle. Braam and several associates joined the hardware-oriented Xyratex when it acquired the assets of ClusterStor, while Barton, Dilger, and others formed software startup Whamcloud, where they continued to work on Lustre. In August 2011, OpenSFS awarded a contract for Lustre feature development to Whamcloud. This contract covered the completion of features, including improved Single Server Metadata Performance scaling, which allows Lustre to better take advantage of many-core metadata server; online Lustre distributed filesystem checking (LFSCK), which allows verification of the distributed filesystem state between data and metadata servers while the filesystem is mounted and in use; and Distributed Namespace Environment (DNE), formerly Clustered Metadata (CMD), which allows the Lustre metadata to be distributed across multiple servers. Development also continued on ZFS-based back-end object storage at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. These features were in the Lustre 2.2 through 2.4 community release roadmap. In November 2011, a separate contract was awarded to Whamcloud for the maintenance of the Lustre 2.x source code to ensure that the Lustre code would receive sufficient testing and bug fixing while new features were being developed. In July 2012 Whamcloud was acquired by Intel, after Whamcloud won the FastForward DOE contract to extend Lustre for exascale computing systems in the 2018 timeframe. OpenSFS then transitioned contracts for Lustre development to Intel. In February 2013, Xyratex Ltd., announced it acquired the original Lustre trademark, logo, website and associated intellectual property from Oracle. In June 2013, Intel began expanding Lustre usage beyond traditional HPC, such as within Hadoop. For 2013 as a whole, OpenSFS announced request for proposals (RFP) to cover Lustre feature development, parallel file system tools, addressing Lustre technical debt, and parallel file system incubators. OpenSFS also established the Lustre Community Portal, a technical site that provides a collection of information and documentation in one area for reference and guidance to support the Lustre open source community. On April 8, 2014, Ken Claffey announced that Xyratex/Seagate was donating the lustre.org domain back to the user community, and this was completed in March, 2015. In June 2018, the Lustre team and assets were acquired from Intel by DDN. DDN organized the new acquisition as an independent division, reviving the Whamcloud name for the new division. In November 2019, OpenSFS and EOFS announced at the SC19 Lustre BOF that the Lustre trademark had been transferred to them jointly from Seagate.  Release history  Lustre file system was first installed for production use in March 2003 on the MCR Linux Cluster at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the largest supercomputer at the time. Lustre 1.0.0 was released in December 2003, and provided basic Lustre filesystem functionality, including server failover and recovery. Lustre 1.2.0, released in March 2004, worked on Linux kernel 2.6, and had a \\"size glimpse\\" feature to avoid lock revocation on files undergoing write, and client side data write-back cache accounting (grant). Lustre 1.4.0, released in November 2004, provided protocol compatibility between versions, could use InfiniBand networks, and could exploit extents/mballoc in the ldiskfs on-disk filesystem. Lustre 1.6.0, released in April 2007, allowed mount configuration (‚Äúmountconf‚Äù) allowing servers to be configured with \\"mkfs\\" and \\"mount\\", allowed dynamic addition of object storage targets (OSTs), enabled Lustre distributed lock manager (LDLM) scalability on symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) servers, and provided free space management for object allocations. Lustre 1.8.0, released in May 2009, provided OSS Read Cache, improved recovery in the face of multiple failures, added basic heterogeneous storage management via OST Pools, adaptive network timeouts, and version-based recovery. It was a transition release, being interoperable with both Lustre 1.6 and Lustre 2.0. Lustre 2.0, released in August 2010, was based on significant internally restructured code to prepare for major architectural advancements. Lustre 2.x clients cannot interoperate with 1.8 or earlier servers. However, Lustre 1.8.6 and later clients can interoperate with Lustre 2.0 and later servers. The Metadata Target (MDT) and OST on-disk format from 1.8 can be upgraded to 2.0 and later without the need to reformat the filesystem. Lustre 2.1, released in September 2011, was a community-wide initiative in response to Oracle suspending development on Lustre 2.x releases. It added the ability to run servers on Red Hat Linux 6 and increased the maximum ext4-based OST size from 24 TB to 128 TB, as well as a number of performance and stability improvements. Lustre 2.1 servers remained inter-operable with 1.8.6 and later clients. Lustre 2.2, released in March 2012, focused on providing metadata performance improvements and new features. It added parallel directory operations allowing multiple clients to traverse and modify a single large directory concurrently, faster recovery from server failures, increased stripe counts for a single file (across up to 2000 OSTs), and improved single-client directory traversal performance. Lustre 2.3, released in October 2012, continued to improve the metadata server code to remove internal locking bottlenecks on nodes with many CPU cores (over 16). The object store added a preliminary ability to use ZFS as the backing file system. The Lustre File System ChecK (LFSCK) feature can verify and repair the MDS Object Index (OI) while the file system is in use, after a file-level backup/restore or in case of MDS corruption. The server-side IO statistics were enhanced to allow integration with batch job schedulers such as SLURM to track per-job statistics. Client-side software was updated to work with Linux kernels up to version 3.0. Lustre 2.4, released in May 2013, added a considerable number of major features, many funded directly through OpenSFS. Distributed Namespace Environment (DNE) allows horizontal metadata capacity and performance scaling for 2.4 clients, by allowing subdirectory trees of a single namespace to be located on separate MDTs. ZFS can now be used as the backing filesystem for both MDT and OST storage. The LFSCK feature added the ability to scan and verify the internal consistency of the MDT FID and LinkEA attributes. The Network Request Scheduler (NRS) adds policies to optimize client request processing for disk ordering or fairness. Clients can optionally send bulk RPCs up to 4 MB in size. Client-side software was updated to work with Linux kernels up to version 3.6, and is still interoperable with 1.8 clients. Lustre 2.5, released in October 2013, added the highly anticipated feature, Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM). A core requirement in enterprise environments, HSM allows customers to easily implement tiered storage solutions in their operational environment. This release is the current OpenSFS-designated Maintenance Release branch of Lustre. The most recent maintenance version is 2.5.3 and was released in September 2014. Lustre 2.6, released in July 2014, was a more modest release feature wise, adding LFSCK functionality to do local consistency checks on the OST as well as consistency checks between MDT and OST objects. The NRS Token Bucket Filter (TBF) policy was added. Single-client IO performance was improved over the previous releases. This release also added a preview of DNE striped directories, allowing single large directories to be stored on multiple MDTs to improve performance and scalability. Lustre 2.7, released in March 2015, added LFSCK functionality to verify DNE consistency of remote and striped directories between multiple MDTs. Dynamic LNet Config adds the ability to configure and modify LNet network interfaces, routes, and routers at runtime. A new evaluation feature was added for UID/GID mapping for clients with different administrative domains, along with improvements to the DNE striped directory functionality. Lustre 2.8, released in March 2016, finished the DNE striped directory feature, including support for migrating directories between MDTs, and cross-MDT hard link and rename. As well, it included improved support for Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) on the client, Kerberos authentication and RPC encryption over the network, and performance improvements for LFSCK. Lustre 2.9 was released in December 2016 and included a number of features related to security and performance. The Shared Secret Key security flavour uses the same GSSAPI mechanism as Kerberos to provide client and server node authentication, and RPC message integrity and security (encryption). The Nodemap feature allows categorizing client nodes into groups and then mapping the UID/GID for those clients, allowing remotely administered clients to transparently use a shared filesystem without having a single set of UID/GIDs for all client nodes. The subdirectory mount feature allows clients to mount a subset of the filesystem namespace from the MDS. This release also added support for up to 16MiB RPCs for more efficient I/O submission to disk, and added the \`ladvise\` interface to allow clients to provide I/O hints to the servers to prefetch file data into server cache or flush file data from server cache. There was improved support for specifying filesystem-wide default OST pools, and improved inheritance of OST pools in conjunction with other file layout parameters. Lustre 2.10 was released in July 2017 and has a number of significant improvements. The LNet Multi-Rail (LMR) feature allows bonding multiple network interfaces (InfiniBand, Omni- Path, and/or Ethernet) on a client and server to increase aggregate I/O bandwidth. Individual files can use composite file layouts that are constructed of multiple components, which are file regions based on the file offset, that allow different layout parameters such as stripe count, OST pool/storage type, etc. Progressive File Layout (PFL) is the first feature to use composite layouts, but the implementation is flexible for use with other file layouts such as mirroring and erasure coding. The NRS Token Bucket Filter (TBF) server-side scheduler has implemented new rule types, including RPC-type scheduling and the ability to specify multiple parameters such as JobID and NID for rule matching. Tools for managing ZFS snapshots of Lustre filesystems have been added, to simplify the creation, mounting, and management of MDT and OST ZFS snapshots as separate Lustre mountpoints. Lustre 2.11 was released in April 2018 and contains two significant new features, and several smaller features. The File Level Redundancy (FLR) feature expands on the 2.10 PFL implementation, adding the ability to specify mirrored file layouts for improved availability in case of storage or server failure and/or improved performance with highly concurrent reads. The Data-on-MDT (DoM) feature allows small (few MiB) files to be stored on the MDT to leverage typical flash-based RAID-10 storage for lower latency and reduced IO contention, instead of the typical HDD RAID-6 storage used on OSTs. As well, the LNet Dynamic Discovery feature allows auto-configuration of LNet Multi-Rail between peers that share an LNet network. The LDLM Lock Ahead feature allows appropriately modified applications and libraries to pre-fetch DLM extent locks from the OSTs for files, if the application knows (or predicts) that this file extent will be modified in the near future, which can reduce lock contention for multiple clients writing to the same file. Lustre 2.12 was released on December 21, 2018 and focused on improving Lustre usability and stability, with improvements the performance and functionality of the FLR and DoM features added in Lustre 2.11, as well as smaller changes to NRS TBF, HSM, and JobStats. It added LNet Network Health to allow the LNet Multi-Rail feature from Lustre 2.10 to better handle network faults when a node has multiple network interfaces. The Lazy Size on MDT (LSOM) feature allows storing an estimate of the file size on the MDT for use by policy engines, filesystem scanners, and other management tools that can more efficiently make decisions about files without a fully accurate file sizes or blocks count without having to query the OSTs for this information. This release also added the ability to manually restripe an existing directory across multiple MDTs, to allow migration of directories with large numbers of files to use the capacity and performance of several MDS nodes. The Lustre RPC data checksum added SCSI T10-PI integrated data checksums from the client to the kernel block layer, SCSI host adapter, and T10-enabled hard drives. Lustre 2.13 was released on December 5, 2019 and added a new performance-related features Persistent Client Cache (PCC), which allows direct use of NVMe and NVRAM storage on the client nodes while keeping the files part of the global filesystem namespace, and OST Overstriping which allows files to store multiple stripes on a single OST to better utilize fast OSS hardware. As well, the LNet Multi-Rail Network Health functionality was improved to work with LNet RDMA router nodes. The PFL functionality was enhanced with Self-Extending Layouts (SEL) to allow file components to be dynamically sized, to better deal with flash OSTs that may be much smaller than disk OSTs within the same filesystem. The release also included a number of smaller improvements, such as balancing DNE remote directory creation across MDTs, using Lazy-size-on-MDT to reduce the overhead of \\"lfs find\\", directories with 10M files per shard for ldiskfs, and bulk RPC sizes up to 64MB.  Architecture  A Lustre file system has three major functional units: * One or more metadata servers (MDS) nodes that have one or more metadata target (MDT) devices per Lustre filesystem that stores namespace metadata, such as filenames, directories, access permissions, and file layout. The MDT data is stored in a local disk filesystem. However, unlike block-based distributed filesystems, such as GPFS and PanFS, where the metadata server controls all of the block allocation, the Lustre metadata server is only involved in pathname and permission checks, and is not involved in any file I/O operations, avoiding I/O scalability bottlenecks on the metadata server. The ability to have multiple MDTs in a single filesystem is a new feature in Lustre 2.4, and allows directory subtrees to reside on the secondary MDTs, while 2.7 and later allow large single directories to be distributed across multiple MDTs as well. * One or more object storage server (OSS) nodes that store file data on one or more object storage target (OST) devices. Depending on the server's hardware, an OSS typically serves between two and eight OSTs, with each OST managing a single local disk filesystem. The capacity of a Lustre file system is the sum of the capacities provided by the OSTs. * Client(s) that access and use the data. Lustre presents all clients with a unified namespace for all of the files and data in the filesystem, using standard POSIX semantics, and allows concurrent and coherent read and write access to the files in the filesystem. The MDT, OST, and client may be on the same node (usually for testing purposes), but in typical production installations these devices are on separate nodes communicating over a network. Each MDT and OST may be part of only a single filesystem, though it is possible to have multiple MDTs or OSTs on a single node that are part of different filesystems. The Lustre Network (LNet) layer can use several types of network interconnects, including native InfiniBand verbs, Omni-Path, RoCE, and iWARP via OFED, TCP/IP on Ethernet, and other proprietary network technologies such as the Cray Gemini interconnect. In Lustre 2.3 and earlier, Myrinet, Quadrics, Cray SeaStar and RapidArray networks were also supported, but these network drivers were deprecated when these networks were no longer commercially available, and support was removed completely in Lustre 2.8. Lustre will take advantage of remote direct memory access (RDMA) transfers, when available, to improve throughput and reduce CPU usage. The storage used for the MDT and OST backing filesystems is normally provided by hardware RAID devices, though will work with any block devices. Since Lustre 2.4, the MDT and OST can also use ZFS for the backing filesystem in addition to ext4, allowing them to effectively use JBOD storage instead of hardware RAID devices. The Lustre OSS and MDS servers read, write, and modify data in the format imposed by the backing filesystem and return this data to the clients. This allows Lustre to take advantage of improvements and features in the underlying filesystem, such as compression and data checksums in ZFS. Clients do not have any direct access to the underlying storage, which ensures that a malfunctioning or malicious client cannot corrupt the filesystem structure. An OST is a dedicated filesystem that exports an interface to byte ranges of file objects for read/write operations, with extent locks to protect data consistency. An MDT is a dedicated filesystem that stores inodes, directories, POSIX and extended file attributes, controls file access permissions/ACLs, and tells clients the layout of the object(s) that make up each regular file. MDTs and OSTs currently use either an enhanced version of ext4 called ldiskfs, or ZFS/DMU for back-end data storage to store files/objects using the open source ZFS-on-Linux port. The client mounts the Lustre filesystem locally with a VFS driver for the Linux kernel that connects the client to the server(s). Upon initial mount, the client is provided a File Identifier (FID) for the root directory of the mountpoint. When the client accesses a file, it performs a filename lookup on the MDS. When the MDS filename lookup is complete and the user and client have permission to access and/or create the file, either the layout of an existing file is returned to the client or a new file is created on behalf of the client, if requested. For read or write operations, the client then interprets the file layout in the logical object volume (LOV) layer, which maps the file logical offset and size to one or more objects. The client then locks the file range being operated on and executes one or more parallel read or write operations directly to the OSS nodes that hold the data objects. With this approach, bottlenecks for client-to-OSS communications are eliminated, so the total bandwidth available for the clients to read and write data scales almost linearly with the number of OSTs in the filesystem. After the initial lookup of the file layout, the MDS is not normally involved in file IO operations since all block allocation and data IO is managed internally by the OST. Clients do not directly modify the objects or data on the OST filesystems, but instead delegate this task to OSS nodes. This approach ensures scalability for large-scale clusters and supercomputers, as well as improved security and reliability. In contrast, shared block-based filesystems such as GPFS and OCFS allow direct access to the underlying storage by all of the clients in the filesystem, which requires a large back- end SAN attached to all clients, and increases the risk of filesystem corruption from misbehaving/defective clients.  Implementation  In a typical Lustre installation on a Linux client, a Lustre filesystem driver module is loaded into the kernel and the filesystem is mounted like any other local or network filesystem. Client applications see a single, unified filesystem even though it may be composed of tens to thousands of individual servers and MDT/OST filesystems. On some massively parallel processor (MPP) installations, computational processors can access a Lustre file system by redirecting their I/O requests to a dedicated I/O node configured as a Lustre client. This approach is used in the Blue Gene installation at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Another approach used in the early years of Lustre is the liblustre library on the Cray XT3 using the Catamount operating system on systems such as Sandia Red Storm, which provided userspace applications with direct filesystem access. Liblustre was a user-level library that allows computational processors to mount and use the Lustre file system as a client. Using liblustre, the computational processors could access a Lustre file system even if the service node on which the job was launched is not a Linux client. Liblustre allowed data movement directly between application space and the Lustre OSSs without requiring an intervening data copy through the kernel, thus providing access from computational processors to the Lustre file system directly in a constrained operating environment. The liblustre functionality was deleted from Lustre 2.7.0 after having been disabled since Lustre 2.6.0, and was untested since Lustre 2.3.0. In Linux Kernel version 4.18, the incomplete port of the Lustre client was removed from the kernel staging area in order to speed up development and porting to newer kernels. The out-of-tree Lustre client and server is still available for RHEL, SLES, and Ubuntu distro kernels, as well as vanilla kernels.  Data objects and file striping  In a traditional Unix disk file system, an inode data structure contains basic information about each file, such as where the data contained in the file is stored. The Lustre file system also uses inodes, but inodes on MDTs point to one or more OST objects associated with the file rather than to data blocks. These objects are implemented as files on the OSTs. When a client opens a file, the file open operation transfers a set of object identifiers and their layout from the MDS to the client, so that the client can directly interact with the OSS node where the object is stored. This allows the client to perform I/O in parallel across all of the OST objects in the file without further communication with the MDS. If only one OST object is associated with an MDT inode, that object contains all the data in the Lustre file. When more than one object is associated with a file, data in the file is \\"striped\\" in chunks in a round-robin manner across the OST objects similar to RAID 0 in chunks typically 1MB or larger. Striping a file over multiple OST objects provides significant performance benefits if there is a need for high bandwidth access to a single large file. When striping is used, the maximum file size is not limited by the size of a single target. Capacity and aggregate I/O bandwidth scale with the number of OSTs a file is striped over. Also, since the locking of each object is managed independently for each OST, adding more stripes (one per OST) scales the file I/O locking capacity of the file proportionately. Each file created in the filesystem may specify different layout parameters, such as the stripe count (number of OST objects making up that file), stripe size (unit of data stored on each OST before moving to the next), and OST selection, so that performance and capacity can be tuned optimally for each file. When many application threads are reading or writing to separate files in parallel, it is optimal to have a single stripe per file, since the application is providing its own parallelism. When there are many threads reading or writing a single large file concurrently, then it is optimal to have one stripe on each OST to maximize the performance and capacity of that file. In the Lustre 2.10 release, the ability to specify composite layouts was added to allow files to have different layout parameters for different regions of the file. The Progressive File Layout (PFL) feature uses composite layouts to improve file IO performance over a wider range of workloads, as well as simplify usage and administration. For example, a small PFL file can have a single stripe on flash for low access overhead, while larger files can have many stripes for high aggregate bandwidth and better OST load balancing. The composite layouts are further enhanced in the 2.11 release with the File Level Redundancy (FLR) feature, which allows a file to have multiple overlapping layouts for a file, providing RAID 0+1 redundancy for these files as well as improved read performance. The Lustre 2.11 release also added the Data-on-Metadata (DoM) feature, which allows the first component of a PFL file to be stored directly on the MDT with the inode. This reduces overhead for accessing small files, both in terms of space usage (no OST object is needed) as well as network usage (fewer RPCs needed to access the data). DoM also improves performance for small files if the MDT is SSD-based, while the OSTs are disk-based. In Lustre 2.13 the OST Overstriping feature allows a single component to have multiple stripes on one OST, while the Self-Extending Layout feature allows the component size to be dynamic during write so that it can cope with (flash) OSTs running out of space before the whole filesystem is out of space.  Metadata objects and DNE remote or striped directories  When a client initially mounts a filesystem, it is provided the 128-bit Lustre File Identifier (FID, composed of the 64-bit Sequence number, 32-bit Object ID, and 32-bit Version) of the root directory for the mountpoint. When doing a filename lookup, the client performs a lookup of each pathname component by mapping the parent directory FID Sequence number to a specific MDT via the FID Location Database (FLDB), and then does a lookup on the MDS managing this MDT using the parent FID and filename. The MDS will return the FID for the requested pathname component along with a DLM lock. Once the MDT of the last parent directory is determined, further directory operations (for non-striped directories) take place exclusively on that MDT, avoiding contention between MDTs. For DNE striped directories, the per-directory layout stored on the parent directory provides a hash function and a list of MDT directory FIDs across which the directory is distributed. The Logical Metadata Volume (LMV) on the client hashes the filename and maps it to a specific MDT directory shard, which will handle further operations on that file in an identical manner to a non-striped directory. For readdir() operations, the entries from each directory shard are returned to the client sorted in the local MDT directory hash order, and the client performs a merge sort to interleave the filenames in hash order so that a single 64-bit cookie can be used to determine the current offset within the directory.  Locking  The Lustre distributed lock manager (LDLM), implemented in the OpenVMS style, protects the integrity of each file's data and metadata. Access and modification of a Lustre file is completely cache coherent among all of the clients. Metadata locks are managed by the MDT that stores the inode for the file, using FID as the resource name. The metadata locks are split into separate bits that protect the lookup of the file (file owner and group, permission and mode, and access control list (ACL)), the state of the inode (directory size, directory contents, link count, timestamps), layout (file striping, since Lustre 2.4), and extended attributes (xattrs, since Lustre 2.5). A client can fetch multiple metadata lock bits for a single inode with a single RPC request, but currently they are only ever granted a read lock for the inode. The MDS manages all modifications to the inode in order to avoid lock resource contention and is currently the only node that gets write locks on inodes. File data locks are managed by the OST on which each object of the file is striped, using byte-range extent locks. Clients can be granted overlapping read extent locks for part or all of the file, allowing multiple concurrent readers of the same file, and/or non-overlapping write extent locks for independent regions of the file. This allows many Lustre clients to access a single file concurrently for both read and write, avoiding bottlenecks during file I/O. In practice, because Linux clients manage their data cache in units of pages, the clients will request locks that are always an integer multiple of the page size (4096 bytes on most clients). When a client is requesting an extent lock the OST may grant a lock for a larger extent than originally requested, in order to reduce the number of lock requests that the client makes. The actual size of the granted lock depends on several factors, including the number of currently granted locks on that object, whether there are conflicting write locks for the requested lock extent, and the number of pending lock requests on that object. The granted lock is never smaller than the originally requested extent. OST extent locks use the Lustre FID of the object as the resource name for the lock. Since the number of extent lock servers scales with the number of OSTs in the filesystem, this also scales the aggregate locking performance of the filesystem, and of a single file if it is striped over multiple OSTs.  Networking  The communication between the Lustre clients and servers is implemented using Lustre Networking (LNet), which was originally based on the Sandia Portals network programming application programming interface. Disk storage is connected to the Lustre MDS and OSS server nodes using direct attached storage (SAS, FC, iSCSI) or traditional storage area network (SAN) technologies, which is independent of the client-to-server network. LNet can use many commonly used network types, such as InfiniBand and TCP (commonly Ethernet) networks, and allows simultaneous availability across multiple network types with routing between them. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is used for data and metadata transfer between nodes when provided by the underlying networks, such as InfiniBand, RoCE, iWARP, and Omni-Path, as well as proprietary high-speed networks such as Cray Aries and Gemini, and Atos BXI. High availability and recovery features enable transparent recovery in conjunction with failover servers. Since Lustre 2.10 the LNet Multi-Rail (MR) feature allows link aggregation of two or more network interfaces between a client and server to improve bandwidth. The LNet interface types do not need to be the same network type. In 2.12 Multi-Rail was enhanced to improve fault tolerance if multiple network interfaces are available between peers. LNet provides end-to-end throughput over Gigabit Ethernet networks in excess of 100 MB/s, throughput up to 11 GB/s using InfiniBand enhanced data rate (EDR) links, and throughput over 11 GB/s across 100 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  High availability  Lustre file system high availability features include a robust failover and recovery mechanism, making server failures and reboots transparent. Version interoperability between successive minor versions of the Lustre software enables a server to be upgraded by taking it offline (or failing it over to a standby server), performing the upgrade, and restarting it, while all active jobs continue to run, experiencing a delay while the backup server takes over the storage. Lustre MDSes are configured as an active/passive pair exporting a single MDT, or one or more active/active MDS pairs with DNE exporting two or more separate MDTs, while OSSes are typically deployed in an active/active configuration exporting separate OSTs to provide redundancy without extra system overhead. In single-MDT filesystems, the standby MDS for one filesystem is the MGS and/or monitoring node, or the active MDS for another file system, so no nodes are idle in the cluster.  HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management)  Lustre provides the capability to have multiple storage tiers within a single filesystem namespace. It allows traditional HSM functionality to copy (archive) files off the primary filesystem to a secondary archive storage tier. The archive tier is typically a tape-based system, that is often fronted by a disk cache. Once a file is archived, it can be released from the main filesystem, leaving only a stub that references the archive copy. If a released file is opened, the Coordinator blocks the open, sends a restore request to a copytool, and then completes the open once the copytool has completed restoring the file. In addition to external storage tiering, it is possible to have multiple storage tiers within a single filesystem namespace. OSTs of different types (e.g. HDD and SSD) can be declared in named storage pools. The OST pools can be selected when specifying file layouts, and different pools can be used within a single PFL file layout. Files can be migrated between storage tiers either manually or under control of the Policy Engine. Since Lustre 2.11, it is also possible to mirror a file to different OST pools with a FLR file layout, for example to pre-stage files into flash for a computing job. HSM includes some additional Lustre components to manage the interface between the primary filesystem and the archive: * Coordinator: receives archive and restore requests and dispatches them to agent nodes. * Agent: runs a copytool to copy data from primary storage to the archive and vice versa. * Copytool: handles data motion and metadata updates. There are different copytools to interface with different archive systems. A generic POSIX copytool is available for archives that provide a POSIX-like front-end interface. Copytools are also available for the High Performance Storage System (HPSS), Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM), Amazon S3, and Google Drive. * Policy Engine: watches filesystem Changelogs for new files to archive, applies policies to release files based on age or space usage, and communicates with MDT and Coordinator. The Policy Engine can also trigger actions like migration between, purge, and removal. The most commonly used policy engine is RobinHood, but other policy engines can also be used. HSM also defines new states for files including: * Exist: Some copy, possibly incomplete exists in a HSM. * Archive: A full copy exists on the archive side of the HSM. * Dirty: The primary copy of the file has been modified and differs from the archived copy. * Released: A stub inode exists on an MDT, but the data objects have been removed and the only copy exists in the archive. * Lost: the archive copy of the file has been lost and cannot be restored * No Release: the file should not be released from the filesystem * No Archive: the file should not be archived  Deployments  Lustre is used by many of the TOP500 supercomputers and large multi-cluster sites. Six of the top 10 and more than 60 of the top 100 supercomputers use Lustre file systems. These include: K computer at the RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science, the Tianhe-1A at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin, China, the Jaguar and Titan at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Blue Waters at the University of Illinois, and Sequoia and Blue Gene/L at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). There are also large Lustre filesystems at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Texas Advanced Computing Center, Brazilian National Laboratory of Scientific Computing, and NASA in North America, in Asia at Tokyo Institute of Technology, in Europe at CEA, and many others.  Commercial technical support  Commercial technical support for Lustre is often bundled along with the computing system or storage hardware sold by the vendor. Some vendors include Cray, Dell, Hewlett-Packard (as the HP StorageWorks Scalable File Share, circa 2004 through 2008), Groupe Bull, Fujitsu. Vendors selling storage hardware with bundled Lustre support include Hitachi Data Systems, DataDirect Networks (DDN), NetApp, Seagate Technology, and others. It is also possible to get software-only support for Lustre file systems from some vendors, including Whamcloud. Amazon Web Services offers Amazon FSx for Lustre, a fully managed service, making it easy to launch and run high-performance file systems cost effectively in the cloud.

It spans the Caloosahatchee River, connecting Fort Myers and Cape Coral. It is a four-lane fixed span one and one-quarter mile long. The bridge is so-named because its placement situates it roughly halfway between the Cape Coral Bridge to the south, and the Caloosahatchee Bridge to the north. It carries County Road 884, which is known as Colonial Boulevard on the Fort Myers Side, and Veterans Parkway on the Cape Coral Side. The bridge is owned by the Lee County Department of Transportation. There is currently a two dollar toll in effect for westbound vehicles only, and there is no toll for eastbound traffic. Florida's statewide SunPass prepaid electronic toll collection system is accepted on the Midpoint Bridge, along with Lee County's Leeway prepaid toll system, which is also used on the Cape Coral Bridge and the Sanibel Causeway. On the Cape Coral side of the bridge, there is a replica of the statue from the Marine Corps War Memorial in Rosslyn, Virginia (which is just outside Washington, D.C.). The statue depicts the six U.S Marines raising the American flag at the Battle of Iwo Jima. On the Fort Myers side, there is a small Vietnam War Memorial. History Building a second bridge between Cape Coral and Fort Myers was first proposed in the 1970s, but construction was delayed for many years, largely due to opposition in Fort Myers. After a series of court battles, reaching the Florida Supreme Court, construction began in 1995, and the bridge opened for traffic on October 19, 1997. Earlier in 1959, the bridge's location was considered as possible location of the Cape Coral Bridge before its current location was determined. The Midpoint Memorial Bridge was constructed as part of the extension of Colonial Boulevard into Cape Coral. Before construction, Colonial Boulevard terminated at State Road 867 (McGregor Boulevard), which runs parallel to the river. In Cape Coral, CR 884 (locally known as Veterans Parkway) now terminates at SR 78 (Pine Island Road) near Matlacha, and includes an overpass over the intersection with Del Prado Boulevard (CR 867A). The addition of the Midpoint Memorial Bridge resulted in several ancillary road projects in Fort Myers as well. Colonial Boulevard was widened to six lanes and overpasses were constructed over McGregor Boulevard and at the intersection with US 41.

Historians such as Michael Kaplan and Elliott Gorn have argued that an intensifying highly masculine working-class male identity fostered gangs, brawling, and even homicide and rape, which was fueled by New York City taverns. The emerging male code emphasized physical courage, defiance of authority, and class pride. Irish and German immigrants brought European influences. Sexual harassment of women increased because women were more visible outside the home, as many worked in factories and shops. Women were regarded as depersonalized objects of lewd talk, and gang rapes became an opportunity for male bonding.Michael Kaplan, \\"New York city tavern violence and the creation of a working-class male identity,\\" Journal of the Early Republic (1995) 15#4 pp 591-617 in JSTORPeter Adams, The Bowery Boys: Street Corner Radicals and the Politics of Rebellion (2005).Elliott J.

Central Park John Singer Sargent, Frederick Law Olmsted, (1822-1903) (1895) As the population grew explosively in Lower Manhattan after 1820, middle-class residents were drawn to the few existing open spaces, mainly cemeteries, to get away from the noises, smells, and chaotic life in the city. Landscape painter Asher B. Durand and writer William Cullen Bryant, recalling their rural upbringing and the great parks of Europe, advocated the therapeutic value of nature in the overcrowded city.Linda Fischer and Harrison Hunt, \\"Asher B. Durand, William Cullen Bryant, and the Origins of Central Park,\\" New York Journal of American History (2007) 66#4 pp 93-100. Along with architect Andrew Jackson Downing, they envisioned a great park. The state government in 1853 provided $5 million and eminent domain powers to buy out the land owners of what became Central Park. Egbert L. Viele drew the original plans, but Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux made the final Greensward Plan design and have received the main credit.Burrows and Wallace, Gotham pp 790-95 \\"Angel of the Waters\\", in Bethesda Fountain (sculpted 1873) Several American influences came together in the design. Landscaped rural cemeteries, such as Mount Auburn in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, provided examples of idyllic, naturalistic landscapes. The most influential innovations in the Central Park design were the multiple circulation plans for pedestrians, horseback riders, and pleasure vehicles. The crossing routes for commercial traffic were concealed in sunken roadways screened with densely planted shrub belts so as to maintain a natural setting. It was the nation's first great urban park; Olmsted taught Americans a new sensibility in park environments and urban planning as an applied science with his radically naturalistic park design.Andrew Menard, \\"The Enlarged Freedom of Frederick Law Olmsted,\\" New England Quarterly (2010) 83#3 pp. 508-538 in JSTOREugene P.

Civil War 1860 map of New York City Prior to the Civil War, in 1861, Mayor Wood proposed New York City secession from the United States as a neutral sovereign city-state to be called Tri-Insula as a way to avoid the ravages of war. Despite strong local Copperhead sympathies, the proposal was not well received. The city provided a major source of troops, supplies, equipment, and financing for the Union Army. Powerful New York politicians and newspaper editors helped shape public opinion toward the war effort and the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. The port of New York, a major entry point for immigrants, served as recruiting grounds for the Army.Edward K. Spann, Gotham at War: New York City, 1860-1865 (2002) In July 1863, Irish Catholic protestors of conscription began five days of rioting.

Gilfoyle, \\"Scorsese's Gangs of New York: Why Myth Matters.\\" Journal of Urban History 29.5 (2003): 620-630 at p. 624. Burrows and Wallace, Gotham (1999) 1148 By contrast, Owney Geoghegan ran The toughest nightclub in New York, 1880‚Äì83. It catered to a downscale clientele and besides the usual illegal liquor, gambling and prostitution, it featured nighly fistfights, and occasional shootings, stabbings, and police raids.Lewis A. Erenberg, Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890-1930 (1981). Webster Hall is credited as the first modern nightclub. It opened in 1886 as a \\"social hall\\", originally functioning as a home for dance and political activism events. Gilded Age The Great East River Bridge To connect the cities of New York and Brooklyn, Currier & Ives, 1872 The Taylor Map of New York, 1879 The post-war period was noted for the corruption and graft for which Tammany Hall has become proverbial, but equally for the foundation of New York's pre-eminent cultural institutions, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, and the American Museum of Natural History. The Brooklyn Museum was a major institution of New York's independent sister city. New York newspapers were read across the nation, particularly, the New York Tribune, edited by Horace Greeley, the voice of the new Republican Party.Jeter Allen Isely, Horace Greeley and the Republican Party, 1853-1861: A Study of the New York Tribune (1947) Immigration The flood of immigration from Europe passed first through Castle Clinton (opened 1855) and then through Ellis Island (opened 1892) in New York Harbor, with the nearby Statue of Liberty opening in 1886. Most of the new arrivals headed to destinations across the north and west, but many made New York City their destination. European immigration brought further social upheaval, and old world criminal societies rapidly exploited the already corrupt municipal machine politics of Tammany Hall. Housing, especially in the southern tip of Manhattan, became crowded with newly built tenements and flimsy shacks in the back. Italians settled around Mulberry Street between the East Village and Lower Manhattan, in an area later to be known as \\"Little Italy.\\" Many Yiddish-speaking East European Jews came to the Lower East Side. In the Orange Riots of July 1871 and 1872, Catholic Irish attempted to stop Protestant Irish from celebrating the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne. These resulted in more than 33 deaths and many wounded.Michael Gordon, The Orange riots: Irish political violence in New York City, 1870 and 1871 (1993)Access Genealogy Orange Riots Pioneering photojournalist Jacob Riis documented the poor conditions of immigrant tenement dwellers in his 1890 How the Other Half Lives; he was befriended by Republican reformer Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt lost his mayoral race in 1886. Reformers did win in 1894, and Roosevelt undertook a major reform of the New York City Police Department in 1895‚Äì97 during his term as President of the Police Commissioners.Jay Stuart Berman, Police administration and progressive reform: Theodore Roosevelt as police commissioner of New York (1987). =Public health= Epidemics (typhus, cholera, diphtheria, and tuberculosis) were rampant in the city's slums. Horse manure covered the streets. In winter, when all the grime froze, walking on the sidewalks was a challenge. Dead pigs and other carcasses remained on the street for weeks.Maria Farland, \\"Decomposing City: Walt Whitman's new York and the Science of Life and Death,\\" ELH (2007) 74#4 pp 799-827 in JSTOR In 1894, Colonel George E. Waring, Jr. introduced sanitary reforms using a large street cleaning force.John Duffy, History of public health in New York City (2 vol. 1968, 1974)Judith Walzer Leavitt, \\"Review: Writing Public Health History: The Need for a Social Scaffolding,\\" Reviews in American History (1976) 4#2 pp. 150-157 in JSTOR Politics =Tammany Hall= William Tweed, better known as Boss Tweed, had become the sole leader of Tammany Hall by 1867. From April 1870, with the passage of a city charter consolidating power in the hands of his political allies, Tweed and his cronies were able to defraud the city of some tens of millions of dollars over the next two years and eight months, most famously with the construction bill for a lavish courthouse. The efforts of reform- oriented Democratic politicians, especially Samuel J. Tilden, as well as aggressive newspaper editors aided by the biting cartoons of Thomas Nast, helped elect opposition candidates in 1871. Tweed was convicted of forgery and larceny in 1873. Tweed's fall put an end to the immunity of corrupt local political leaders and was a precursor to Progressive Era reforms in the city.Oliver E. Allen, The Tiger: The Rise and Fall of Tammany Hall (1993) online edition In this 1899 Udo Keppler cartoon from Puck, all of New York City politics revolves around boss Richard Croker. Tammany did not take long to rebound from Tweed's fall. Reforms demanded a general housecleaning, and former county sheriff \\"Honest John\\" Kelly was selected as the new leader. Kelly was not implicated in the Tweed scandals and was a religious Catholic related by marriage to Archbishop John McCloskey. He cleared Tammany of Tweed's people and tightened the Grand Sachem's control over the hierarchy. His success at revitalizing the machine was such that in the election of 1874, the Tammany candidate, William H. Wickham, unseated the unpopular reformist incumbent, William F. Havemeyer, and Democrats generally won their races, delivering control of the city back to Tammany Hall.Burrows & Wallace, Gotham p. 1027 Theodore Roosevelt, before he became president in 1901, was deeply involved in New York City politics. He explains how the machine worked: :The organization of a party in our city is really much like that of an army. There is one great central boss, assisted by some trusted and able lieutenants; these communicate with the different district bosses, whom they alternately bully and assist. The district boss in turn has a number of half-subordinates, half-allies, under him; these latter choose the captains of the election districts, etc., and come into contact with the common healers. = Reformers = Middle-class moral sensibilities were deeply opposed to prostitution and all forms of gambling. The reform movement was strongest in the 1890s. Reform was led by men such as the Reverend Charles H. Parkhurst, the leading Presbyterian pastor and president of the New York Society for the Prevention of Crime;Warren Sloat, A Battle for the Soul of New York: Tammany Hall, Police Corruption, Vice and Reverend Charles Parkhurst's Crusade Against Them, 1892-1895 (2002) review reform mayor William L. Strong, and his police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt. Reformers passed laws in the state legislature against any emerging gambling venue. Such laws were enforced in most small towns and rural areas, but not in New York's larger cities, where political machines controlled the police and the courts.Mike Wallace, Greater Gotham: A history of New York City from 1898 to 1919 (2017), pp 615-618 Economy Street beggar, 1888 In 1874, nearly 61% of all U.S. exports passed through New York harbor. In 1884, nearly 70% of U.S. imports came through New York. The eventual rise of ports on the Gulf of Mexico and on the Pacific coast reduced New York's share of imports and exports to about 47% in 1910. The city's banking resources grew 250% between 1888 and 1908, compared to the national increase of 26%. Between 1860 and 1907, the assessed value of the land and buildings on Manhattan rose from $1.7 billion to $6.7 billion. The city and its suburbs, mainly Brooklyn and Long Island City, also became important in light industry. Its factories dominated the garment industry and some high technology industries of the second industrial revolution such as sewing machines and pianos. It was an important center for other hi-tech items such as hard rubber products and electrical goods. Petroleum and chemical works sprang up along Newtown Creek, Bayonne, New Jersey, and other industrial suburbs. =Department stores= In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century and permanently reshaped shopping habits and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were underway in Paris and London.Gunther Barth, \\"The Department Store,\\" in City People: The Rise of Modern City Culture in Nineteenth-Century America. (Oxford University Press, 1980) pp 110-47, New York became a regional and national destination for upscale shoppers, thanks to its development of the modern department store. London and Paris were developing department stores around the same time, and the leaders quickly adopted innovations. In 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established his \\"Marble Palace\\" on Broadway, between Chambers and Reade Streets.Harry E. Resseguie, \\"A.T. Stewart's Marble Palace‚ÄîThe Cradle of the Department Store.\\" New York Historical Society Quarterly (1964) 48#2 : 131-162. He offered upscale retail merchandise at fixed prices. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction had large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. Increasingly, the clientele were women from wealthy or upper-middle- class families.Gunther Barth, City People: The Rise of Modern City Culture in Nineteenth-Century America (1982) pp 110-147 In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. His innovations were quickly copied by other department stores.Harry E. Resseguie, \\"Alexander Turney Stewart and the Development of the Department Store, 1823-1876,\\" Business History Review (1965) 39#3 pp. 301-322 in JSTOR In 1858, Rowland Hussey Macy founded Macy's as a dry goods store. Benjamin Altman and Lord & Taylor soon competed with Stewart as New York's earliest department stores. By the 1880s New York's retail center had moved uptown, forming a stretch of retail shopping from \\"Marble Palace\\" that was called the \\"Ladies' Mile\\". By 1894 the major stores competed in the Christmas season with elaborate Christmas window displays; in 1895 Macy's featured 13 tableaux, including scenes from Jack and the Beanstalk, Gulliver's Travels and other children's favorites. The department store was especially important for women; in middle-class families women took control of the purchasing, and the department stores catered to their tastes. Furthermore, ambitious young women from the middle class who wanted a career were welcomed into the clerical ranks, where they developed social skills to work with their upscale customers.William R. Leach, \\"Transformations in a culture of consumption: women and department stores, 1890-1925.\\" Journal of American History (1984): 319-342. in JSTORSusan Benson, Counter cultures: Saleswomen, managers, and customers in American department stores, 1890-1940 (1987).  Skyscrapers and apartment buildings  New inventions facilitated the emergence of the skyscraper in the 1880s‚Äîit was a characteristic American style that was not widely copied around the world until the late 20th century. Construction required several major innovations, including the elevator and structural steel. The steel skeleton, developed in the 1880s, replaced the heavy brick walls that were limited to 15 or so stories in height. The skyscraper also required a complex internal structure to solve issues of ventilation, steam heat, gas lighting (and later electricity), and plumbing.George H. Douglas, Skyscrapers: A social history of the very tall building in America (2004) The Dakota luxury apartment building, view from Central Park, 1890 The city's housing involved a wide variety of styles, but most of the attention focused on the tenement house for the working class and the apartment building for the middle class. The apartment building came first, as middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white- collar workers realized they did not need and could scarcely afford single- family dwellings in the high-cost real estate districts of the city. Boarding houses were inappropriate for family; hotel suites were too expensive. In outlying neighborhoods there were many apartments over stores and shops, usually occupied by proprietors of small local businesses. Apartment dwellers paid rent and did not own their apartments until the emergence of cooperatives in the 20th century. Turnover was very high, and there was seldom was a sense of neighborhood community.Amy Kallman Epstein, \\"Multifamily Dwellings and the Search for Respectability: Origins of the New York Apartment House,\\" Urbanism Past & Present (1980) Issue 2, pp 29-39Elizabeth Collins Cromley, Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments (1990) Starting with the luxurious Stuyvesant Apartments that opened in 1869, and the even more lavish The Dakota in 1884, affluent tenants hired full-time staff to handle the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.Stephen Birmingham, Life at the Dakota (1979)Andrew Alpern, New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869. The less- lavish middle-class apartment buildings provided gas lighting, elevators, good plumbing, central heating, and maintenance men on call. Apartment buildings were built along the paths of the street railways since the middle-class tenants rode the streetcar to work, while the working class saved a nickel each way and walked.Elizabeth Blackmar, Manhattan for Rent, 1785-1850 (1989) The working class crowded into tenement houses, with far fewer features and amenities.Andrew S. Dolkart, Biography of a Tenement House in New York City: An Architectural History of 97 Orchard Street (2006). Dolkart's Jewish tenement, while equally dark, airless, filthy, and crowded, appears far less threatening than those of Stephen Crane. Novelist Stephen Crane in Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893) wrote of an Irish tenement neighborhood characterized by poverty and violence: :Eventually they entered into a dark region where, from a careening building, a dozen gruesome doorways gave up loads of babies to the street and the gutter. A wind of early autumn raised yellow dust from cobble and swirled it against an hundred windows. Long streamers of garments fluttered from fire escapes. In all unhandy places there were buckets, brooms, rags, and bottles. In the street infants played or fought with other infants or sat stupidly in the way of vehicles. Formidable women, with uncombed hair and disordered dress, gossiped while leaning on railings, or screamed in frantic quarrels. Withered persons, in curious postures of submission to something, sat smoking pipes in obscure corners. A thousand odors of cooking food came forth to the street. The building quivered and creaked from the weight of humanity stamping about in its bowels. Tenements were cheap and easy to build, and filled up almost the entire lot. There were typically five story walk-ups, with four separate apartments on each floor. There was minimal air circulation and sunlight. Until the reforms of 1879, newly built tenements lacked running water or indoor toilets. A law in 1901 required indoor plumbing be retrofitted to older tenements. Garbage pickup was erratic until late in the 19th century. Rent was cheap for those who could endure the dust, clutter, smells and noises; the only cheaper alternatives were squalid basement rooms in older buildings. Most of the tenements survived until the urban renewal movement of the 1950s.Richard Plunz, A History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Social Change in the American Metropolis (1990).Raymond A. Mohl, The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920 (1985) pp 47-52 Neighborhoods Pre-war steam ferries had already made Brooklyn Heights into a bedroom community for affluent professionals on Wall Street and other urban areas. Elevated railroads, operated by the Manhattan Railway Company, and other new public transport expanded the commuter area of New York, allowing development of suburbs for commuters of more modest means in Upper West Side and other distant areas. Plans were made for subways to still more remote exurbs such as Harlem and the West Bronx. In the late 19th century, the island's schist bedrock encouraged the early skyscrapers whose successors characterize its skyline today. The Great Blizzard of 1888 exposed the vulnerability of the urban infrastructure connecting those buildings, encouraging the undergrounding of electric and telephone lines, and plans were made for a subway line. Consolidation This 1877 Currier & Ives print of an unfinished Brooklyn Bridge showed a vision of greater urban integration. In 1855, the City of Brooklyn annexed Williamsburg and Bushwick, forming the third most- populous city in America. In 1870, Long Island City was formed in Queens. In 1874, New York City annexed the West Bronx, west of the Bronx River. The Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, epitomized the heroic confidence of a generation and drew the two cities of Brooklyn and New York inexorably together. As Brooklyn annexed the remainder of Kings County in the decade from 1886 to 1896, the issue of consolidation grew more pressing. The modern city of Greater New York -- the five boroughs -- was created in 1898, with the consolidation of the cities of New York (then Manhattan and the Bronx) and Brooklyn with the largely rural areas of Queens and Staten Island.

The WSA argued that the best way to build a movement in the working class, like SDS wanted, was for students to become involved in workers' struggles both on and off the campuses. In practice, that usually meant students enrolled in school would get jobs as cafeteria hands and other manual labor jobs at those schools. Organizational history The WSA explicitly rejected the rest of the New Left's insistence that it would be various combinations of 'progressive' nationalism and popular rebellion that would jump-start the revolution; rather, the WSA said the catalyst would be organized workers in various industries and the service sector, and that students could best help spread and deepen workers' class consciousness by really being among the workers themselves, rather than just using their class designation in rhetoric to appear more Marxist. The WSA faction took about 900 of the approximately 1400 representatives in the split at the 1969 SDS convention in Chicago. The other 500, who had been the Revolutionary Youth Movement, left to form a myriad of other groups. SDS chapters around the country then split along these same lines, or disbanded entirely. Both the RYM and the WSA kept the SDS name, but the Weatherman organization continued to hold the SDS National Office and all the SDS membership lists; thus it was able to assume effective \\"command\\" of the name and public face of SDS despite its inferior size. Nearly immediately post-conference, Weatherman led their \\"Days of Rage\\" Chicago riots of 1969 and other sporadic acts of violence ‚Äî all under the SDS name ‚Äî until 1970, when Mark Rudd and a few other Weathermen decided to close the SDS National Office and drop the SDS name. PL, however, continued to keep its SDS for several more years. Since all active SDS chapters after 1970 were SDS-WSA, the \\"WSA\\" initials were dropped. In 1974 PL's SDS voted to dissolve itself and join the Committee Against Racism which PL had helped to form at a conference at New York University in November 1973. The CAR eventually expanded to several other countries and added \\"International\\" to its name to become InCAR, but InCAR was in many respects another \\"mass organization\\" led and directed by the PLP, with separate publications and staff, but always with a goal of winning InCAR members to support PLP. By 1996, this strategy was too much to maintain, and PLP elected to pursue pure and open communist activity again, using only its own party as an organizational structure.

In 1986, graphics were added and the game was released for additional home computers. Plot Opening screen (C64)First graphical screen (C64) The character controlled by the player is knocked unconscious and awakens in the fairy land of Kerovnia, a silver bracelet around their wrist that cannot be removed. A general election is about to be held to decide whether King Erik will be replaced by a dwarf whose campaign promise is to \\"rid dungeons of mazes of any sort.\\" The character must interact with others and perform tasks for them, gathering objects that will be needed for later tasks in order to escape from Kerovnia and return to reality. Development The Pawn was written by Rob Steggles at Magnetic Scrolls in 1985, and a text-only version was first published for the Sinclair QL in 1985. After Magnetic Scrolls secured a publication deal with Rainbird, a graphical version of the game was then released for other platforms in 1986. The game is written in 68000 assembler. Later versions use a cut-down 68000 virtual machine even on less powerful machines like the Z80-based Sinclair Spectrum. The Amiga version uses digitized instrument samples in its title music early in that computer's lifecycle. The peaceful title music was composed by John Molloy and it features guitar and flute sounds. Reception By late 1987, The Pawn was Firebird's second best-selling Commodore game. Reviewers complimented it for its excellent graphics (on some versions) and the opening music available in some game versions. The game itself‚Äìstory and parser‚Äìgot mostly positive reviews. * In the October 1986 edition of Compute!, Neil Randall described The Pawn as \\"parod[ying] the entire genre of interactive fiction, showing us that much of it ‚Äî even the serious stuff ‚Äî has its shortcomings\\", giving as example a character campaigning to eliminate mazes in text adventures. Randall commented that some of the Atari ST version's graphics were \\"superb\\" but wished that the pictures contributed to solving the game instead of being optional. He concluded that \\"Firebird has given us a good adventure, one that bodes well for the company and for all of us adventurers\\". * In the December 1986 edition of Computer Gaming World, Roy Wagner stated that The Pawn \\"shows how well something can be done for the Amiga when one KNOWS the machine\\". Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"Both humor and challenge are present here, two of the key elements of any good adventure (along with an excellent parser and outstanding presentation).\\" * In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1987 edition of Info, Benn Dunnington gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, praising the \\"excellent graphics\\" and text parser. Dunnington concluded, \\"The Pawn's story is good, the characters are interesting, and the play is entertaining\\". * In the July 1987 edition of Commodore Magazine, Shay Adams thought the game's sophisticated parser \\"handily parses circles arounjd every American counterpart except Infocom's - and it's not far behind that one.\\" Adams was highly impressed by the game plot as well, saying, \\"The Pawn also delivers well-honed prose, vivid graphics, innovative visual effects, and dozens of puzzles - some diabolically difficult, others deceptively simple - in an imaginative story.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation: \\"Technically and creatively, this is England's all-time best adventure game. For advanced players, The Pawn is a must whether you prefer text or graphic adventures.\\" Two reviews of the game appeared in Dragon: *In the October 1986 edition, Hartley and Pattie Lesser stated that the Atari ST version's \\"'painted' scenes will leave you in awe\\". They also praised the \\"sophisticated language parser\\" and thought \\"the intriguing plot\\" would be \\"extremely appealing to all gamers.\\" *In the June 1988 edition, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser reviewed the IBM PC and PC compatible version, commenting that since their previous review The Pawn \\"is steadily pushing toward the status of becoming a classic adventure.\\" The Lessers thought highly of the game, saying, \\"The Pawn is not only great for experienced adventurers, but because of the interactivity of the scenario‚Äôs characters, it also enables novice gamers to learn as they progress through the land of Kerovnia.

Biography  Scriba was born in Darmstadt, Germany and studied to become a pharmacist as well as a physician. His studies were interrupted by a year of military service during the Franco- Prussian War of 1871. He graduated three years after the end of the war from the University of Heidelberg and practiced medicine in Freiburg im Breisgau. He apprenticed under the noted surgeon Vincenz Czerny and from 1879 served as a lecturer at the University of Freiburg. In addition to his medical accomplishments, he was also a gifted amateur botanist, and published a book on the flora of the Grand-Duchy of Hesse. Beginning in 1870, the Meiji government of Japan hired a series of German medical specialists to establish a modern medical school system in Japan. At the time, German medicine was considered to be the most advanced in Europe, with most medical textbooks and research papers published in the German language. Western medicine had been introduced into Edo period Japan by German-speaking physicians such as Engelbert Kaempfer and Philipp Franz von Siebold, and the German physician Erwin Balz was serving as the personal physician to Emperor Meiji. Scriba was employed by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor from 6 June 1881 to 5 June 1887, and taught surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology and gynecology at the Medical School of Tokyo Imperial University. In 1885 he first described the endemic form of bacterial infection pyomyositis in the tropics. He returned once to Germany on the expiration of his contract, but his contract was renewed again from 2 September 1889 to 10 September 1901. During his second tenure in Japan, he is credited with performing the first craniectomy for a depressed skull fracture in Japan in 1892. He trained many surgeons who later became leaders in modern Japanese surgery. His Japanese assistant Miyake Hayari (1867‚Äì1945) was one of the first Japanese neurosurgeons. From 1893 he was imperial embassy doctor at the German embassy in Tokyo. Subsequently, he was chief surgeon until 1905 at the St. Luke's Hospital in Tokyo. He also was the first honorary member of the Japanese Society for Surgery and Honorary Professor of the University of Tokyo. Scriba was called upon by the Japanese government twice during particularly sensitive international incidents: the first time was after the Otsu Scandal, when Russian Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovitch (the future Tsar Nicholas II), was assaulted by a Japanese policeman in 1891; and the second time when the Chinese diplomat Li Hung-chang was shot while attending the Shimonoseki Peace Conference in 1895 which ended the First Sino-Japanese War. For his services, Emperor Meiji awarded him the Order of the Sacred Treasures. Scriba died of a lung abscess in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture in 1905, and was buried in the foreign section of Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

He had been a champion high-jumper at Caulfield Grammar School, winning the senior high jump at the 1955 Associated Grammar Schools Combined Athletics Meeting (as had South Melbourne's Jim Taylor in 1948). He also played for the school's First XVIII, a team which also contained other future VFL players, Ron Evans of Essendon and Ron Cabble of Hawthorn. VFL career Schultz was recruited by Footscray from country side Boort, having previously played briefly with Caulfield Grammarians Football Club in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (he broke his arm at the opening bounce of the first Caulfield Grammarians' practice match of the 1956 season). Schultz was considered a \\"gentle giant\\", known as much for his fairness as for his brilliance. An effective knock ruckman, he was acclaimed for good tackling, elegant marking and hard, fair bumping. Roy Wright, another \\"gentle giant\\" and Brownlow medallist, helped him early in his career: \\"after lining up on Roy Wright in one of my first matches, he came to the dressing rooms after the match and gave me a few hints on things I did and didn't do right\\".Geoff Slattery (ed), The Brownlow, Slattery Media, Docklands, 2010, p. 139. Compared with others of his day, Schultz had exceptional stamina and he seemed to be able to run just as quickly at the end of a match as he had at its beginning. Schultz won the Brownlow Medal in 1960 (when only 21 years old) by one vote from 's Kevin Murray. He was Footscray's best and fairest player five times (1960, 1962, 1964‚Äì66). Schultz played for Victoria 21 times, and was an All-Australian in 1961. In 1961, Footscray, playing a fast game using the soon-to-be-outlawed \\"flick pass\\", won through to their second Grand Final, this time against , who were playing in their first Grand Final. On a hot day, in front of over 100,000 spectators, the Hawks, dubbed Kennedy's Commandos for their fanatical approach to fitness, overran the Bulldogs in the second half to claim their first VFL premiership. Schultz played as an amateur. He played his entire VFL with the great Ted Whitten as his captain, and retired in 1968, aged only twenty-nine, to help manage the family grocery business. His younger brother Robert, also from Caulfield Grammar School, played two senior games for Footscray in 1963. Post-VFL Career Fittingly for a man who was known for his fairness and never once reported, Schultz later served on the league tribunal. He once said, \\"I love nothing more than seeing someone shake another player's hand after a tough game ‚Äì that's the ultimate in sportsmanship.\\"Geoff Slattery (ed), The Brownlow, Slattery Media, Docklands, 2010, p. 138. In 1996 Schultz was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame with the following citation: :Rucking giant who never let the side down. Set the standard for the modern ruckman. In 2002, Schultz was named in the back pocket of the Footscray/Western Bulldogs Team of the Century. Schultz is still heavily involved at the Bulldogs, serving as a mentor to the playing group. He was given the honour of handing the Premiership cup to Easton Wood, Luke Beveridge and Robert Murphy after the Western Bulldogs won the 2016 AFL Grand Final. Personal life Schultz lives in Shoreham, a town on the Mornington Peninsula. He was married to Elaine, who came from Durham Ox, the town next to Boort, until she died in 2013.

Dudleya is a genus of succulent perennial plants, consisting of about 45 species in southwestern North America. Many plants in the Dudleya genus were formerly classified as Echeveria. The fleshy and glabrous leaves occur in rosettes, in colors generally ranging from green to gray. The inflorescences are on vertical or inclined stems up to a meter high, but usually much shorter, topped by a cyme with alternate leaf-like bracts. Both the petals and sepals of the small flowers are five in number and fused below. Five pistils, also fused below, have 10 stamens arranged around them. Dudleya species are widespread in their range, typically found in rock outcroppings, cliff faces, or road cuts, where their leaves help them store water in a setting too dry for most types of plants. Most are small and inconspicuous when not in bloom. The genus is named after William Russell Dudley, the first head of the botany department at Stanford University. In horticulture, Dudleya should be planted at an angle. This allows accumulated water to drain from the nestlike center of the plant, thus preventing microbial decay.

The Imperial Court System is a grassroots network of organizations that works to build community relationships for equality and raise monies for charitable causes through the production of annual Gala Coronation Balls that invite an unlimited audience of attendees to be presented at Royal Court in their fanciest attire throughout North America along with numerous other fundraisers each year, all for the benefit of their communities. The Imperial Court System is the second largest LGBT organization in the world, surpassed only by the Metropolitan Community Church.San Francisco Bay Times San Francisco Bay Times History The Imperial Court System in the United States was founded in San Francisco, California, in 1965 by Jos√© Sarria. Sarria, affectionately known as \\"Mama Jos√©\\" or similar among Imperial Court members, adopted the surname \\"Widow Norton\\" as a reference to Joshua Norton, a much-celebrated citizen of 19th-century San Francisco who had declared himself Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico in 1859.Gorman, Michael Robert MA (1998). The Empress Is a Man: Stories from the Life of Jos√© Sarria. New York: Haworth Press. . Sarria soon became the nexus of a fundraising group with volunteer members bearing titles of nobility bestowed by yearly elected figurehead leaders of Emperor and Empress. In the United States, the first court outside of San Francisco was in Portland, Oregon, which joined with San Francisco in 1971 to start the Court System, followed by Seattle, and then by Vancouver (by the Empress of Canada, ted northe, who was crowned Empress of Canada in 1964 by the long standing Rose Court of Portland Oregon and who always spelled his name in the lower case), who founded the Canadian Court System in 1971, after being inspired by attending a ball in Portland OR, and thus became the International Court System). These empires operated and formed policies more-or-less independently until an Imperial Court Council led by Sarria was formed to prevent participation by groups that were not strictly and solely involved with charitable fundraising.Imperial Council of San Francisco Imperial Court of San Francisco, the Founding Mother Court of the International Court System For years, some chapters of the Canadian Imperial Courts remained outside the recognition of the Widow Norton and the Imperial Court Council for various reasons, some regulatory and some related to dispute over northe's title. Eventually ICS leadership recognized northe as The Empress of All Canada, which ended a substantial falling out between ted northe and the international court system. In 1997, northe was among the first recipients of the \\"Jos√© Honors Award\\" handed out by Sarria.Jose Honors VIII - coming in November, 2004 to Historic Boston! 1997 Jos√© Honors Award Recipients Infrequently, a schism within a court chapter has given rise to a \\"rogue court\\" unrecognized by the organization as a whole. Most of these so-called \\"rogue courts\\" or \\"rival courts\\" have collapsed and dissolved within a few years. Structure Each individual court chapter (or \\"Empire\\") is a separate, legally-incorporated charitable non-profit organization that raises funds and awareness for various charities and civic causes for people in need within its realm. Each chapter has its own Board of Directors and is financially responsible for its own management. In addition to local non-profit status, many courts in the United States have Federal 501(c) status. The Imperial Court Council, created in 1995, is an incorporated non-profit organization created to advise chapters of the Imperial Court System and, when necessary, to grant or rescind recognition by the ICS as a whole. The Council also urges a degree of consistency regarding matters of protocol via proclamations which are generally observed by all chapters.\\"Imperial Court System founder Jose Sarria steps down\\". Gay & Lesbian Times On 17 February 2007, Sarria (who turned 84 years old in December 2006) officially passed the leadership of the ICS to Empress Nicole the Great of San Diego, CA (real name Nicole Murray-Ramirez), who held the designation of Heir Apparent 1st in Line of Succession, in a ceremony held in Seattle, Washington.

Some realms cover entire states, such as Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa or Montana while others cover cities such as the city of Toronto, counties or regions, the communities of Alameda County, California or the Greater Niagara Region.ICS Chapters International Imperial Court System Directory Most chapters are Imperial Courts and are also known as \\"Empires\\". A few chapters are called \\"ducal court\\" (infrequently called a \\"duchy\\") or \\"barony\\" (infrequently called a \\"baronial court\\"). The term ducal court is typically used in the rare situation when one chapter's area overlaps with the territory of an already established chapter, as is the case with the Grand Ducal Council of San Francisco and the Grand Ducal Council of Alameda. The term barony is typically used when a new chapter has yet to fully be elevated to the level of infrastructure and successful fundraising characteristic with those chapters deemed full-fledged Imperial Courts. Except for the titles used by the monarchs (i.e. baroness rather than empress, etc.) baronial and ducal chapters function in essentially the same way as those chapters headed by Emperors and Empresses. Indicative of the ICS's continued growth, in the past decade, three of North America's largest metropolitan areas -- Boston, Chicago, and Washington, DC, ‚Äî established baronies which have since become prominent and successful Imperial Courts.The Imperial Court of Massachusetts: History of the Realm History of the Imperial Court of Massachusetts Like other empires whose official names are similarly verbose, this chapter is often referred to by a simpler and more obvious appellation (in this case, Imperial Court of Chicago) As the oldest chapter in the organization, the Imperial Court of San Francisco is considered the \\"Mother Court\\" of the Imperial Court System. The term \\"Mother Court\\" is also used for a court chapter who grants the recognition and establishment a new court. For example, the Imperial Court of New York is the Mother Court of the Imperial Court of Rhode Island at Providence.  Titles  Each court holds an annual \\"coronation\\" (or \\"adornment\\" in the case of baronies and ducal courts) which is usually the chapter's largest fundraiser and is attended by both local people and members of other chapters from across North America. The evening culminates with the ceremony in which the new monarch or monarchs are crowned. The method by which monarchs are selected varies from chapter to chapter, ranging from election by vote among the active membership in closed session to election by open vote of the community region in which individuals are residents...held between one week to up to six months before the coronation to election by all in attendance on the night of the ceremony.Grove Royals Reign at Imperial Court's Night of 1000 Gowns, - Features & Interviews reviewed by Jeannie Lieberman on TheaterScene.net Theatre.net The office of monarch is taken very seriously within the court system and requires a large commitment of the holder's time and money. Accordingly, while the presence of an \\"imperial couple\\" is the norm, it is not uncommon for an emperor or empress to reign alone depending on the availability of suitably dedicated and charismatic candidates with the necessary resources to fulfil the requirements of a one-year reign. In the most frequent case, several weeks after coronation the new monarch or monarchs present their court titles at a fundraiser called investitures. The titles given to members vary from one chapter to another and are primarily left to the discretion of the reigning monarch or monarchs, the fons honorum (fountain of honor) of their chapter. Typical titles awarded are Imperial Crown Prince, Grand Duchess, Marquess, Viscount, etc. Other appellations bestowed resemble offices or professions within a medieval or modern noble court rather than titles of nobility, such as \\"Court Jester\\" or \\"Chancellor of the Realm\\" and so forth. These titles may be as serious-sounding or as humorously campy as the monarchs wish. Titles are traditionally based upon those used by European nobility (especially the British Peerage) but nothing prohibits the creation of titles such as Czarina, Raja or Sultan and these are sometimes used as well. Noble titles are ranked according to an order of precedence so that, for example, a member who has been created a duke takes precedence over a member who has been created a countess. The main effect of this hierarchy involves the order that members are introduced during \\"protocol\\", a ceremonial procedure endemic to the Imperial Court in which courts are presented with courtiers titles read by the master of ceremonies as members approach the presiding monarchs of the coronation. This bit of pageantry, which is typically reserved for coronations and similar large events, gives Imperial Court members an opportunity to display their titles as well as costumes to the assembled crowd. Monarchs, both reigning and former, are typically allowed to create various societies, clubs, houses, fraternities, sororities and so forth. These are typically for the sole purpose of granting membership to people they wish to honor. Many of these have colorful names that are either grandiose, humorous or both. Examples include the House of Fairies, Friends and Frivolity, the Order of the Far East, The Society of the Crown and Scepter, \\"La Casa De Milagros\\" - The House of Miracles, etc. In some cases, membership is exclusive; in other cases, it is granted relatively indiscriminately. Unlike titles, these memberships are rarely if ever regulated by chapters' by-laws or boards of directors. Similar to society memberships are \\"family titles\\" such as the Foxx Family Den or the Surreal Family Dynasty. Monarchs often name people as sons, daughters, brothers, uncles, and so forth. These are likewise typically unregulated within the system and may be granted as freely or as sparingly as a monarch wishes.Unlike actual ICS titles, society memberships, family titles and similar honors may typically be awarded to Non-ICS members.  Fundraising  Due to the decentralized nature of the organization and inconsistent record keeping in some chapters early in their histories, it is difficult to estimate the total amount of money raised by the ICS. Proceeds from the Imperial Court of New York City's renowned \\"Night of a Thousand Gowns\\" have resulted in as much as $67,000 donated to its charitable recipients in a single weekend. Since its inception, the Imperial Court de San Diego has raised at least $1 million.:: Welcome to NewYorkQnews.com :: New York Q News In 2008 (Reign 22), The Imperial Court of Toronto awarded their charities $60,000 under Emperor 22 Hunter James and Empress 22 Tiffany Louise-Charles. Each court conducts numerous fundraisers throughout the year. Drag shows, ranging in size from performances at local bars to events in hotel ballrooms and other large venues, are the main way in which revenue is raised for charity. Especially in recent years, court chapters have diversified their fundraising strategies to include yard sales, gift raffles, etc. Court members also solicit donations at LGBT events, gay pride parades and other public events. Imperial Court chapters donate the funds raised to a variety of causes including those related to AIDS, breast cancer, domestic abuse, and homelessness. Empires have also established or contributed to a variety of scholarships. Court chapters receive frequent recognition by elected officials and celebrities for their humanitarian contributions. Unlike many other large charitable fundraising organizations, the Imperial Court System is composed entirely of volunteers. There are no paid positions within the Imperial Court System and both the culture of the Court System and the regulations set down by the boards of directors of each chapter prohibit any member from profiting from the Imperial Court or its activities. Rather, depending on individual level of involvement with the system, many court members spend hundreds or thousands of dollars of their own money each year on costumes, travel to events in other parts of North America, and donations to various charitable beneficiaries.  Membership  Most members are homosexual and transgender people, but membership is open to all. Gay, bisexual, transgender and straight people have all served as monarchs and court members. Drag queens and other sorts of cross-dressers collectively comprise about half of the membership. The Court System also appeals to people interested in various forms of costume and dress-up who are willing to lend their enthusiasm to the court's culture of charitable fundraising. Included among these are people involved with the leather fetishism and leather subcultures, members of the Society for Creative Anachronism and similar historical reenactment hobbyists, various types of cosplay enthusiasts, and so on. Most court members, especially monarchs, past- monarchs and those aspiring towards a throne, wear an assortment of regalia including elaborate crowns, bejeweled chains of office and other costume jewelry which is often custom-made for the wearer. Related groups Many court members are involved with other LGBT groups, especially non-profit groups that provide charitable services directly rather than providing the funds for such services as ICS does. Besides these, two specific spheres of activity have relevance to ICS history: Competitive pageantry: Some court members have also been involved with competitive pageantry, especially drag pageants and the various leather competitions through which people may qualify for International Mister Leather. Like the ICS, these competitions provide an opportunity to garner titles while showcasing one's appearance and talents. Some court chapters grew out of the sphere of competitive pageantry and some courts conduct annual competitive \\"Mr. Gay. ..\\" and \\"Miss Gay. ..\\" (or similarly named) pageants as part of their fundraising schedule.The Bay Area Reporter Online  Mr. and Miss Gay SF titleholders mark milestone Bay Area ReporterUntitled Document In Montana for example, the Mr. & Miss Gay Montana pageant begun in 1987 laid the foundation for that state's empire begun in 1995.ICS Chapters Among those court chapters with webpages that detail their active membership, innumerable example can be found of individuals who hold both court and pageant titles. Ball culture: Less frequently, the Imperial Court System has had overlapping membership and joint ventures with drag houses of the type documented in Paris is Burning. For example, during the 1990s the annual \\"Snow Ball\\" in Hartford was both a coronation and a competition in which contestants did \\"walks\\" in various specific categories in order to win trophies. The ICS has innumerable \\"houses\\" within its ranks as mentioned above. However, unlike ballroom scene houses such as The House of Xtravaganza and House of Labeija, houses within the IICS are not an important means of organization within the group and there is no limit to the number of houses to which a person can belong.Snow Ball 1996 (Imperial Court of Connecticut Coronation Program) See also * List of LGBT-related organizations * Drag ball References External links * Chapters of the Imperial Court System * International Imperial Court System and the International Court Council * International Imperial Court System Calendar Service organizations based in the United States Community organizations Drag events LGBT organizations in Canada LGBT organizations in the United States Ball culture Organizations established in 1965 1965 establishments in California ","title":"Imperial Court System"},{"id":"1779024","text":"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is a 2005 novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. The book's narrator is a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell. In the story, Oskar discovers a key in a vase that belonged to his father, a year after he is killed in the September 11 attacks. The discovery inspires Oskar to search all around New York for information about the key and closure following his father's death.  Synopsis  Oskar Schell is a nine-year-old boy whose father, Thomas Schell, died in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The novel begins after the tragedy, with Oskar narrating. Since his father's death, Oskar struggles with insomnia, panic attacks, and depression. He often describes the feeling of depression as wearing heavy boots, and deals with this by giving himself bruises. His relationship with his mother has also become strained, particularly as she has started dating a man named Ron, whom he resents for replacing his father. One day, in his father's closet, Oskar finds a key in a small envelope inside a vase that he accidentally broke; in the keyshop he finds the name Black and thinks this has something to do with the key. Curious, Oskar sets out on a mission to contact every person in New York City with the last name of Black in the hope of finding the lock that belongs to the key his father left behind, creating a binder with mementos of his journey. One of the first people Oskar meets is a 48-year-old woman named Abby Black. Oskar and Abby instantly become friends, but she has no information on the key. Oskar continues to search the city. Toward the end of his journey Oskar meets an old man he calls \\"the renter\\" because until the point of meeting, Oskar had only heard of the old man's existence from his grandmother who referred to him as the new tenant in her apartment. The reader learns towards the end of the book that \\"the renter\\" is actually Oskar's grandfather, who abandoned his grandmother while she was pregnant with Thomas, though Oskar does not realise the connection. The book spans many months of Oskar's journey, some of which he is accompanied by his eccentric elderly neighbour, Mr. A. Black, and they develop a close friendship. After meeting with a woman named Ruth in the Empire State Building, who has a history of her own with the building, Mr. Black ends his travels with Oskar, who struggles with his departure. He tries to visit Mr. Black again later but finds out he has moved house, presumably to be with Ruth, and is selling his apartment, leaving behind a card for Oskar, reading \\"Oskar Schell: Son\\". Eight months after Oskar initially met Abby, he finds a message from her on the answering machine. Oskar had not touched that phone since his father died because his father's last words had been on an identical answering machine which Oskar had kept hidden from his mother. Oskar finds out that Abby called him directly after his visit, saying she was not completely honest with him and might be able to help. Oskar returns to Abby's apartment after listening to this message, and Abby directs him to her ex- husband, William Black. When Oskar talks to William, he learns that the key once belonged to William's father. In his will, William's father left William a key to a safe-deposit box, but William had already sold the vase at the estate sale to Thomas Schell. Then, Oskar tells William something that he \\"never told anyone\\" ‚Äì the story of the last answering machine message Oskar received from his father, during the attack of 9/11. Disappointed that the key does not belong to him, Oskar then gives William the key and goes home angry and sad, not interested in the contents of the box. Oskar also discovers that his mother knew about his activities the entire time and was contacting everyone with the name Black in New York City. After the first few visits she called every Black that he would meet and informed them that Oskar was going to visit and why. In response, the people Oskar met knew ahead of time why he was coming and usually treated him in a friendly manner. Resolving to try to move on from his father's death, Oskar bonds with Ron after finding out that he met his mother at a support group after having lost his wife and daughter in a car accident. On the second anniversary of his father's death, Oskar meets with \\"the renter\\" and they go to dig up his father's grave. Contemplating on what to put into the empty coffin, \\"the renter\\" decides to bury various letters that he had written to his unborn son. Shortly after returning home, Oskar reconciles with his mother and vows to become better and allow for her to find happiness again, and she tells him how Oskar's father lied to her in his last call, telling her that he was coming home, to assure her not to worry over his death. Before going to bed, Oskar takes out his binder and proceeds to rearrange the pages in reverse in an attempt to relive the last few hours with his father and achieve closure. The novel has a parallel narrative that eventually converges with the main story. This narrative is portrayed through a series of letters written by Oskar's grandfather to Oskar's father Thomas, and by Oskar's grandmother to Oskar himself. The letters written by Oskar's grandfather explain his past in World War II, his first love, and his marriage to Oskar's grandmother. The letters written by Oskar's grandmother explain her past in meeting Oskar's grandfather, the trouble in their relationship, and how important Oskar is to her. Upon learning of his son's death, Oskar's grandfather promptly returns to New York and tracks down Oskar and his grandmother. His grandmother decides to let him live with her in her apartment temporarily, which results in them becoming intimate, and he watches over Oskar from afar before meeting him. Shortly after burying the letters with Oskar, his grandfather returns to the airport where Oskar's grandmother follows him. After discussing the war, losing their loved ones and their marriage, they decide to stay in the airport for a while. The final pages are a flip-book style animation of a photograph of a man falling from the World Trade Center. The animation makes the man appear to fall upwards. Characters Oskar Schell is the nine-year-old protagonist of Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. He is an eccentric, intelligent, and clever young boy who self-identifies as a number of things including inventor, amateur entomologist, origamist, and amateur archaeologist. He often contemplates deeper topics and shows great empathy beyond what the average 9-year-old might have. His thoughts have a tendency to trail off into far-flung ideas, such as ambulances that alert passerby to the severity of their passengers' conditions and plantlike skyscrapers, and he has several assorted hobbies and collections. He is very trusting of strangers and makes friends easily, though he does not have many friends his own age. In the film it is alluded that he has Asperger's syndrome. Oskar mentions being taken in for testing in his first interaction with Abby Black, however he states that \\"...Tests weren't definitive.\\" Oskar's mother, Linda Schell, referred to as \\"Mom\\" by Oskar in the book, cares for her family greatly. After Thomas's death, Linda tells Oskar \\"I won't fall in love again.\\"[4] Though it is implied that she knows Oskar is running around the city meeting strangers, she nevertheless allows him to do so in order to discover more about his father. Oskar's grandmother is a kind woman who is very protective of Oskar. She calls out to him often, and Oskar always responds with \\"I'm okay\\" out of habit. When she arrived in the United States, she read as many magazines as she could to integrate herself into the culture and language. As Anna's (Oskar's grandfather's first love) younger sister, she enters into a tumultuous marriage with Oskar's grandfather, and the couple breaks up before the events of the novel. Mr A. Black is an elderly man who is one hundred and three years of age, who lives in the same apartment building as Oskar, and joins him for some of his journey. Prior to meeting Oskar, Mr. Black had not left his apartment in twenty-four years, after having had a rather adventurous life. He is nearly deaf, and cries after Oskar turns on his hearing aids after a \\"long time\\" where he was unable to hear. Oskar's grandfather, Thomas Schell Sr. (also referred to as \\"the renter\\") is an important character in the story, even though he does not physically meet Oskar until the book's end. After the death of his first love, Anna, Oskar's grandfather loses his voice completely and consequently tattoos the words \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" on his hands. He carries around a \\"daybook\\" where he writes phrases he cannot speak aloud. He marries Anna's younger sister, Oskar's grandmother. Anna is an absent character. She is Oskar's grandfather's first love. Oskar's grandfather falls in love with her instantly. She dies in the Dresden firebombings of World War II after telling Oskar's grandfather of her pregnancy. She is Oskar's grandmother's sister. Abby Black is William Black's ex-wife. She is forty-eight years old and lives by herself. She is friendly and welcoming to Oskar when he arrives at her house, though she does decline Oskar's offer of a kiss. Oskar's father, Thomas Schell, dies before the events of the book begin, having been in 1 World Trade Center the day of the attacks. Oskar remembers him as caring, smelling of aftershave and always humming the song \\"I Am the Walrus\\" by The Beatles. Thomas Schell organizes several expeditions for Oskar, such as a game to find an object from every decade of the past century. These adventures with his father are one of the reasons Oskar begins his journey about the key. Stan is the doorman in the building Oskar lives in. He alerts Oskar when he has mail. Buckminster is Oskar's cat. Background Jonathan Safran Foer's inspiration for his main character came when having difficulty with another project. In an interview, Foer stated, \\"I was working on another story and I just started to feel the drag of it. And so, as a side project, I got interested in the voice of this kid. I thought maybe it could be a story; maybe it would be nothing. I found myself spending more and more time on it and wanting to work on that\\". On the challenges of writing a novel in a child's voice, Foer responded, \\"It's not the voice of a child exactly,\\" adding that \\"in order to create this thing that feels most real, it's usually not by actually giving the most accurate presentation of it.\\" Foer combined the character he had been developing with the 9/11-centered plot. He created the story line from his personal experiences and reactions regarding the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Foer was sleeping off jet lag after returning to New York City from a trip to Spain, when he was woken by a phone call from a friend: \\"He said, 'You have to turn on the TV, a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center.' And then he said, 'I think it's going to be a very strange day.'\\" In another interview, Foer said, \\"I think it's a greater risk not to write about [9/11]. If you're in my position‚Äîa New Yorker who felt the event very deeply and a writer who wants to write about things he feels deeply about‚ÄîI think it's risky to avoid what's right in front of you.\\" Themes Major themes of Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close include trauma, mourning, family, and the struggle between self-destruction and self-preservation. Sien Uytterschout and Kristiaan Versluys have examined the specific types of trauma and recuperative measures that Oskar's grandmother and grandfather go through after the Dresden bombings and that Oskar goes through after the loss of his father. They argue that Oskar has a simultaneous death wish and extreme need for self-preservation: This theme is echoed in Thomas Schell, Sr.'s pronounced survivor guilt and Oskar's grandmother's well-disguised inability to cope with her trauma. They also argue that though Oskar's journey to \\"find\\" his father does not help him get over his traumatic experience, it does allow him to grow closer to his mother. Foer provides a parallel between WWII and the 9/11 attacks to not only show the timelessness of trauma and tragedy ‚Äì how it affects people unbiasedly, but also how coping with trauma also means to revisit the trauma. It is also important to note the impact of the child narrator on the effectiveness of the theme of trauma. In the novel, Oskar never directly addresses through his narration the trauma he faced. Only through his journey through the city and through his grandparents' letters does he mimic the journey one must take when coping with trauma. Cultural impact Authors began producing 9/11 novels as early as 2002 as a way of recognizing the tragedy. Jonathan Safran Foer's novel was one of many that confronted the aftermath of the attacks through the eyes of a New Yorker. However, 9/11 fiction is not only a new subgenre, but a new struggle for many authors. Richard Gray stated in his book on 9/11 literature After The Fall, \\"If there was one thing writers agreed about in response to 9/11, it was the failure of language; the terrorist attacks made the tools of their trade seem absurd.\\" There was a desire to write about the experience, to recognize the individual impact, as well as the greater social impact, while appreciating the mourning of the country, but many authors found it difficult to do so. Foer utilizes the child narrator in an attempt to connect with that struggle. The struggle of the child to understand the trauma is reflective of the struggle many faced after the trauma of the 9/11 attacks. Foer's novel was one of the most popular and widely read novels of this post 9/11 fiction subgenre. Because of its great popularity, its message had a greater impact than many novels of its kind. Apart from the terrorist attacks of September 11, the novel also sheds light on the experience of terrible tragedy. Rebecca Miller of the Library Journal claims \\"Foer nimbly explores the misunderstandings that compound when grief silences its victims.\\" The novel makes sense of and provides a way of moving on from the grief of the specific catastrophe. \\"Few works of literature have succeeded in drawing lasting meaning, whole or fragmentary, from modernity's string of catastrophes‚Ä¶ but Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is one of them, providing a tool to create understanding of grief and loss.\\" Critical response John Updike, writing for The New Yorker, found the novel to be \\"thinner, overextended, and sentimentally watery,\\" compared to Foer's first novel. He stated, \\"the book's hyperactive visual surface covers up a certain hollow monotony in its verbal drama.\\"Updike, John. \\"Mixed Messages\\" The New Yorker, March 14, 2005. In a review for The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani said, \\"While it contains moments of shattering emotion and stunning virtuosity that attest to Mr. Foer's myriad gifts as a writer, the novel as a whole feels simultaneously contrived and improvisatory, schematic and haphazard.\\"Kakutani, Michiko. \\"A Boy's Epic Quest, Borough by Borough\\", The New York Times March 22, 2005. Kakutani also stated the book was \\"cloying\\" and identified the unsympathetic main character as a major issue. The topic of the child narrator is a contentious one. Many critics found the child narrator to be unbelievable and not relatable. Anis Shivani said similarly in a Huffington Post article entitled \\"The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers,\\" claiming Foer \\"Rode the 9/11-novel gravy train with Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, giving us a nine-year-old with the brain of a twenty-eight-year-old Jonathan Safran Foer.\\"Shivani, Anis. \\"The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.\\" The Huffington Post August 7, 2010. Despite several unfavorable reviews, the novel was viewed positively by several critics. Foer's child narrator was featured in a critical article titled \\"Ten of the Best Child Narrators\\" by John Mullan of The Guardian in 2009. The Spectator stated that \\"Safran Foer is describing a suffering that spreads across continents and generations\\" and that the \\"book is a heartbreaker: tragic, funny, intensely moving\\".Olivia Glazebrook, \\"Wearing heavy boots lightly\\", Spectator June 11, 2005. \\"Foer's excellent second novel vibrates with the details of a current tragedy but successfully explores the universal questions that trauma brings on its floodtide.... It's hard to believe that such an inherently sad story could be so entertaining, but Foer's writing lightens the load.\\"\\" Sam Munson, in a review of two novels on catastrophe claimed, \\"Foer has a natural gift for choosing subjects of great import and then pitching his distinctive voice sharply enough to be heard above their historical din.\\" Awards and honors *New York Public Library's \\"Books to Remember\\" list *International Dublin Literary Award Shortlist (2007) *The Morning News Tournament of Books (Quarterfinalist, 2006) *The New York Times Bestseller (Fiction, 2005) *Libraires du Qu√©bec (Laur√©at Roman hors Qu√©b√©c, 2007) *ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (Literature & Language Arts, 2009) *ALA Notable Books for Adults (2006) *Village Voice 25 Favorite Books (2005) *V&A; Illustration Award (2005)  Film adaptation  A film adaptation of the novel was released on January 20, 2012.

Braddon was a Tasmanian delegate to the Constitutional Conventions. Both the suburb of Braddon in the Australian Capital Territory and the Division of Braddon in Tasmania are named after him. Early life Braddon was born in St. Kew, Cornwall in 1829,M. N. Sprod, 'Braddon, Sir Edward Nicholas Coventry (1829‚Äì1904)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 Oct 2007 the son of unsuccessful solicitor Henry Braddon and his wife Fanny White. He had two sisters, one of whom, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, was later a famous novelist. Braddon was educated at various private schools including University College School, and later at University College London. Henry and Fanny separated in 1840, due to Henry's financial failures, and in 1847, Braddon left for India to take a job with his cousin's merchant business. He later joined the Indian civil service, rising to the position of assistant commissioner, and serving as Inspector-General of Registration and Commissioner of Excise and Stamps. Braddon married firstly Mary Georginia Palmer on the 24 Oct 1857 in Calcutta, India, she died aged 24 on the 28th of July 1864 at Simla, Bengal. India. They had two sons and four daughters. One of these sons was Sir Henry Yule Braddon, who was a Rugby union player, representing New Zealand (the All Blacks) and New South Wales, and was later a Commissioner (ambassador) for Australia in the United States. Daughter Alice Gertrude married Colonel Bernard Underwood Nicolay CB (see Nicolay (family)). In 1876, Braddon married Alice Smith, who survived him. During the Indian Mutiny, Braddon fought as a volunteer on behalf of the British forces. In 1872, Braddon wrote a memoir detailing his experiences in India, entitled Life in India. He left the Indian civil service in 1878 and retired to Tasmania. Political career =Tasmanian career= In 1879, Braddon was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the Division of West Devon, and he represented that constituency until November 1888. He became leader of the opposition in 1886 and after the defeat of the James Agnew government, he was asked to form a cabinet. However, he resigned the premiership to Philip Fysh, and instead became Minister for Lands and Works. In 1888, Braddon represented Tasmania on the Federal Council, the predecessor to the Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s. After leaving parliament in 1888, Braddon was appointed Agent-General for Tasmania in London, a position he held until September 1893. After returning to Tasmania, Braddon was again elected the member for West Devon, and again became opposition leader. In April 1894, Braddon became Premier, and held office until 12 October 1899, the longest term of any Premier up to that date. In 1895, Braddon published another volume of memoirs, entitled Thirty Years of Shikar. =Federal career= Braddon was an important proponent of federation in Tasmania. He was elected as one of the Tasmanian representatives to the Constitutional Convention of 1897. At the Convention, he was responsible for the so-called \\"Braddon Clause\\" (or \\"Braddon Blot\\", as it was known by its opponents). The proposed Constitution provided that the Federal Government would assume the power to levy customs duties, an important source of revenue for the states. The Braddon Clause provided that the Commonwealth would have to return at least three-quarters of all duties collected. After fierce debate, during which George Reid threatened to withdraw New South Wales from the Convention, the Clause was limited in operation to ten years after Federation. The now-defunct Clause is still part of the Constitution of Australia as Section 87, however it was superseded by the Surplus Revenue Act 1910. At the federal election of 1901, Braddon was elected to the first Australian Parliament as one of the five members for Tasmania, which had not yet been divided into electoral divisions. He was not only the oldest member of the House of Representatives, but, at almost 72 years of age, he is still the oldest person ever elected to the House of Representatives. The city of Melbourne, where the Parliament then met, had not been founded at the time of his birth. As a supporter of free trade, he joined with Rt Hon Sir George Reid and became a member of the Free Trade Party, where he would occasionally stand as Leader of the Opposition when Reid was absent. Braddon was re-elected at the federal election of 1903, as the first member for the Division of Wilmot, but he died suddenly at his home in Tasmania in 1904 before the parliament returned from recess. Braddon is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Forth, Tasmania. In February 2004, his grave was restored and a lookout constructed nearby to commemorate the centenary of his death. Honours In 1891 Braddon was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In 1897 he was made a member of the Privy Council. The Canberra suburb of Braddon, Australian Capital Territory was named after him in 1928.

In the first decade of the 21st century, revitalization efforts were started and show positive effects.  Geography  Orange Mound is bounded by Semmes St. to the east and by Kimball Avenue to the south. The Southern Avenue/IC Railroad tracks on the north separate it from the Belt Line, Midtown and University Districts, while Lamar Avenue on the southeast and the CN Railroad tracks (visible at Park Av. & Lamar) on the southwest both separate it from Bethel Grove, South Memphis and the East Parkway District. The streets outlining the plantation that originally existed on that ground were Goodwyn St on the east, Park Ave on the south and Airways at the southwest. For context, those earlier plantation borders failed to include Melrose High School, Melrose Stadium, or the Lamar- Airways Shopping Center.  Demographics  The neighborhood has a population of approximately 14,400 of which 95 percent are of African-American heritage.  History  = Deaderick plantation - 1800s = Orange Mound stands on the site of the former John Deaderick plantation. Between 1825 and 1830, Deaderick (whose family donated the land in Nashville on which the Tennessee State Capitol was built) purchased 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) of land (from Airways to Semmes) and built a stately house there (at what is now the east side of Airways, between Carnes and Spottswood). In 1890, a developer named Elzey Eugene Meachem purchased land from the Deaderick family and began developing a subdivision for African-Americans, selling lots for less than $100. In the 1890s, a typical Orange Mound house was a small, narrow \\"shotgun\\"-style house. A tradition says the name comes from mock-orange trees or shrubs on the grounds of the old homeplace. [cit. needed] = Vibrant black community - 1970s = In the 1970s, Orange Mound was billed as \\"the largest concentration of blacks in the United States except for Harlem in New York City.\\" The neighborhood provided a refuge for blacks moving to the city for the first time from rural areas. Although the streets of the early Orange Mound were unpaved, it was a vibrant community in which a mix of residences, businesses, churches, and cultural centers flourished. During the era of desegregation, Orange Mound entered a period of decline as younger residents began to move away. = Drugs and crime - 1980s-1990s = Built on strong families, preachers, churches, and civic pride, this was a huge community of black homeowners in the 1940-50's. [cit needed] Drugs and alcohol had been an issue for many years as they are in any ghetto neighborhood. Once crack entered, the community was destroyed with violence and drug dealing. Drug use devastated poor and middle-class families. The community role models shifted away from teachers, preachers, and doctors to drug dealers and gang members. Orange Mound was listed in 1994 as the # 1 area for murders, burglaries, and rapes in Memphis. Since 1994, Orange Mound has improved considerably as crime has decreased due to the revitalization of the community. = Revitalization - 2000s = In the first decade of the 21st century, Orange Mound has been the focus of a variety of revitalization efforts. One such effort, the Orange Mound Collaborative, funded by a Ford Foundation grant, stresses \\"education through empowerment.\\" The Orange Mound Collaborative's projects include an Early Childhood Institute, and an oral history project in which researchers conduct videotaped interviews with Orange Mound's older residents.  S.M.A.R.T. (2003)  In 2003, Orange Mound was named one of 21 areas in Memphis that are the focus of the S.M.A.R.T. Revitalization Plan (\\"Servicing the Metropolitan Area through the Redevelopment of Targeted neighborhoods\\"), a public-private partnership to create vibrant neighborhoods in declining areas.  Progress (2004)  In a 2004, editorial in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Robert Lipscomb, director of Memphis's Housing and Community Development division, wrote that much progress has been made in revitalizing Orange Mound, through a combination of code enforcement, tenant education programs, and neighborhood cleanup efforts. = 2009, 2010 = In the Fall of 2009, Melrose High School opened its stadium with new state of the art technology, new field, bleachers, and park. This was only a minor point of a changing community. In recent years crime has gone down nearly 10%. Alumni of the high school are taking it upon themselves to become more involved in the lives of the upcoming generation in order to ensure a brighter future.  Orange Mound Community Garden  A group called the Mid-South Peace & Justice Center helped neighborhood residents to create the Orange Mound Community Garden. Organizers of the garden project hope the project will help beautify the community, provide a source of nutritious food, teach leadership skills, and encourage self-reliance.  Culture  = Churches = Churches in Orange Mound, and throughout Memphis, have played a critical role in developing community leaders and fostering stability. Particularly important has been Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, which has been at the corner of Carnes Avenue and David St. since 1926, and Mt Pisgah CME Church on the corner of Park Avenue and Marechalneil. This church played a role in the Civil Rights Movement by assisting activists jailed for their activities in support of racial equality. = Music = Orange Mound hosts a growing underground rap scene as well as national hip-hop stars. The hit rap duo 8 Ball & MJG (Premro Smith and Marlon Jermain Goodwin) grew up in Orange Mound. They met at Ridgeway High in East Memphis where many Orange Mound children were educated from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. = Literature = Orange Mound is the title and setting of a novel written by author Jay Fingers, who grew up in the neighborhood. The novel was recently deemed a \\"Memphis Book for Summer Reading\\" by the Memphis Flyer.Endpapers: Memphis Books for Summer Reading. = Education = Melrose High School and Dunbar Elementary School are located in Orange Mound and serve as a sources of pride and focal points for the community. On Fridays during football season members of the community come together to cheer on the Golden Wildcats at Melrose Stadium. = Key to Orange Mound = Tyler Glover, who operates Tyler's Place restaurant at 2481 Park Avenue, has been elected the \\"Mayor of Orange Mound,\\" and his restaurant the official Orange Mound \\"city hall.\\" During the first term of Memphis Mayor W. W. Herenton, Glover presented Herenton with an orange \\"key to Orange Mound.\\" Glover's words convey the love that Orange Mound's long-term residents feel for Orange Mound: \\"This is the greatest community in the world.... It is the greatest community because I know everybody here and I love working on committees and making this a better place in which to live. I don't want to live any other place than Orange Mound. I have had numerous opportunities to move some place else, but there is no other place in the world I want to live, but Orange Mound, Tenn.\\" In 2007 during Glover incompacity, Orange Mound elected Melrose Veteran and Hall of famer Jason Smith as Mayor. = Online Community Newsletter = On October 6, 2011, a member of the Orange Mound community launched a website for former and current residents of the community, and others, to follow community events, share community-related information, and enlighten each other about the history, events, and vitality of Orange Mound. The website address for the newsletter is https://web.archive.org/web/20161006233615/http://orangemoundunited.com/  References  * Jones, Yolanda (Dec. 24, 2004). \\"Ludacris hustles back to town -- Memphis's working artists stay busy on the road, too.\\" The Commercial Appeal (Memphis), p.

The US Department of Education reacted to reports that some states believed that they should purchase certain reading programs with federal Reading First funds by publishing a statement for states that this was not the case and was not a requirement for federal funding. Still, the perception remained. The program also has many defenders. Some state departments of education and local school districts appreciate the federal support it provides.

It initially runs as two separate rivers: the North Esk and the South Esk. Route The North Esk rises in the North Esk Reservoir in the Pentland Hills, in Midlothian, a mile (1.6 km) north of the village of Carlops. It flows north- east past Penicuik and Auchendinny, where it is joined by the Glencorse Burn, flowing in a south-easterly direction from the Glencorse Reservoir.Ordnance Survey, 1:25000 map The reservoir was built by the Edinburgh Water Company in the 1820s, to supply compensation water to millowners on the Esk when they started to take water from the Glencorse Burn for drinking water supplies. The river continues through Roslin Glen and the Penicuik‚ÄìDalkeith Walkway, past Hawthornden Castle, Polton, Lasswade and Melville Castle. The South Esk rises at the southernmost extremity of Midlothian, on the western slopes of Blackhope Scar (the highest of the Moorfoot Hills). It flows north through Gladhouse Reservoir and Rosebery Reservoir, and by the village of Temple, before receiving the Redside Burn close to Arniston House. It is joined by the Gore Water and then the Dalhousie Burn, just to the west of Newtongrange, before passing Newbattle Abbey and proceeding through Dalkeith. The rivers converge just about north-east of Dalkeith at the edge of the grounds of Dalkeith Palace. From here the River Esk continues north for about , entering the East Lothian region, skirting Inveresk and flowing into the Firth of Forth at Fisherrow (Musselburgh).

The Murray Mallee area is predominantly a vast plain of low elevation, with sandhills and gentle undulating sandy rises, interspersed by flats. The annual rainfall ranges from approximately 250 mm in the north to 400 mm further south. The area was very lightly populated up until the beginning of the 20th century, with marginal pastoral runs of sheep at low stocking rates. Artesian water was discovered at moderate depth, and railways opened to make shipping of grain feasible. The first railway was the Pinnaroo line in 1906 from Tailem Bend on the main Melbourne‚ÄìAdelaide railway. The success of this line led to construction further north of the Brown's Well railway line in 1913, and before that line had been completed, the government approved a number of spur lines from it. These included the Peebinga railway line into the land between the new line and the Pinnaroo line, extending the Brown's Well line north to Paringa, and spurs to Loxton and Waikerie. Another spur, the Moorook railway line opened in 1925. All of these have now closed due to the declining use of railways for grain transport in the area. The main towns in the mallee are Karoonda, Lameroo and Pinnaroo. Towns along the Murray are generally considered to be in the Riverland or Murraylands, rather than the Mallee. Originally the Mallee was covered in thick mallee scrub. Large expanses (estimates are around 80%) of the mallee were cleared for agricultural development, beginning as early as the 1880s. Most of the remaining natural vegetation is in protected areas such as Ngarkat Conservation Park, Billiatt Conservation Park, Karte Conservation Park, Peebinga Conservation Park, Bakara Conservation Park and Lowan Conservation Park.

Sykes explains the principles of genetics and human evolution, the particularities of mitochondrial DNA, and analyses of ancient DNA to genetically link modern humans to prehistoric ancestors. Following the developments of mitochondrial genetics, Sykes traces back human migrations, discusses the \\"out of Africa theory\\" and casts serious doubt upon Thor Heyerdahl's theory of the Peruvian origin of the Polynesians, which opposed the theory of their origin in Indonesia. He also describes the use of mitochondrial DNA in identifying the remains of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and in assessing the genetic makeup of modern Europe. The title of the book comes from one of the principal achievements of mitochondrial genetics, which is the classification of all modern Europeans into seven groups, the mitochondrial haplogroups. Each haplogroup is defined by a set of characteristic mutations on the mitochondrial genome, and can be traced along a person's maternal line to a specific prehistoric woman. Sykes refers to these women as \\"clan mothers\\", though these women did not all live concurrently. All these women in turn shared a common maternal ancestor, the Mitochondrial Eve. The last third of the book is spent on a series of fictional narratives, written by Sykes, describing his creative guesses about the lives of each of these seven \\"clan mothers\\". This latter half generally met with mixed reviews in comparison with the first part.  Mitochondrial haplogroups in The Seven Daughters of Eve The seven \\"clan mothers\\" mentioned by Sykes each correspond to one (or more) human mitochondrial haplogroups. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U (specifically U5, and excluding its subgroup K) * Xenia: corresponds to Haplogroup X * Helena: corresponds to Haplogroup H * Velda: corresponds to Haplogroup V * Tara: corresponds to Haplogroup T * Katrine: corresponds to Haplogroup K * Jasmine: corresponds to Haplogroup J Additional daughters Sykes wrote in the book that there were seven major mitochondrial lineages for modern Europeans, though he subsequently wrote that with the additional data from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, Ulrike (see below) could have been promoted to be the eighth clan mother for Europe.Sykes, Brian, Blood of the Isles (Bantam, 2006) pages 118-119 Others have put the number at 10, 12 or even 18.(February 2014)Distribution of European mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups by region in percentage Eupedia, Retrieved 11 November 2014 These additional \\"daughters\\" generally include haplogroups I, M and W.Liddle, James W.

The band's name translates as 'The mummies' troll' and is a pun on Moomin Troll, the series of Finnish children's books by Tove Jansson. Career The band in 2000 The group was founded on 16 October 1983 in Vladivostok. In 1985, they recorded the first album, Novaya luna aprelya, which was eventually distributed on tape. Mumiy Troll broke up when Lagutenko, who graduated in Mandarin and Chinese Economy, went to serve in the Soviet army (Russian Air Navy). Then he came back, the band released the second album, Delay Yu-Yu in 1990. The early concerts were proven commercially unsuccessful. They first gained immense popularity with the release of their first (official) album Morskaya (–ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è, Marine) in May 1997, which showcased a combination of melodic hard rock and Lagutenko's offbeat lyrics and coy, androgynous performance style. The second CD Ikra (–ò–∫—Ä–∞, Caviar), followed seven months later, and was equally successful. The band in 2007 Mumiy Troll remains one of Russia's most popular musical acts. Ilya Lagutenko defined their music style as rockapops. Once again Mumiy Troll became the leader of an entire new musical trend copied now to greater or lesser degree by Russian wannabees and mainstream artists. Being an example of one of the successful long-standing independent artists in Russia band released 13 albums (including English-language). In 2015 they released album Pirate Copies (in Russian) and in 2016 - Malibu Alibi (English) ‚Äì all songs were created during the band's round-the-world trip on a 19-century sailing ship in locations as diverse as LA, Moscow, China, Singapore and South Africa.

His face is on the cover of the American release. The band on first V-Rox festival, 2013 Mumiy Troll is well known in Japan, China and Europe. The band cooperate with \\"Shoot The Artist\\" (Bjorn Tagemoose, video) and \\"The Agency\\" (North American tours-2009). The band's North American tour of 16 dates earlier this year was a huge success, so \\"The Agency\\" announced another two-month North American tour. In 2001, they represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest and took the 12th position. Time Out (London) wrote that they 'stole the show' by standing out as snakeskin heroes amongst all the taffeta and tuxedos. Being the participants of famous festivals and music conferences in different countries (SXSW, Culture Collide, Zandari Festa, Mu:Con, Sound City, Visual Japan Summit, etc.) in 2013 they founded their own showcase festival \\"Vladivostok Rocks\\" (V-ROX) which is held in Vladivostok annually and has become a massive cultural phenomenon recognized by Russia Beyond The Headlines as \\"A small Pacific Woodstock‚Ä¶‚Äù. In August 2017 the festival was held for the 5th time. Mumiy Troll was the first to support the activities of PSI organization fighting AIDS in Russia and performed at the No Name Fever exhibition for AIDS in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2005. They are also well known for conservation activities on wild life in Far-East taiga and helping local minorities to survive. Ilya Lagutenko is a patron of the British-Russian Amur fund for the protection of Amur tigers and leopards.  Trivia  * The first Russian music video to be broadcast by MTV Russia in 1998 was Mumiy Troll's Vladivostok 2000. * The very same day (31 December 1999) that Mumiy Troll scheduled the release of the single 'The Carnival Is Over' Vladimir Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin. * Their album Merger and Acquisitions (2005) was called back from the printers on the day of release when distributors realized that the bride and groom on the cover were wearing masks of Putin and Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The band changed them into symbols of hearts and United States dollars respectively.

It is common throughout much of the Palearctic region. The species was first described by Carl Alexander Clerck in 1759. Distribution The species can be found in western Europe from northern Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, then east to the Caucasus, northern Iran, Russia, Russian Far East, and Ussuri. Description The female of this species is wingless and rather spider-like and can be found on the trunks and stems of its larval food plants. She is white or yellow-and-black patched. The male is fully winged (wingspan 40‚Äì45 mm) and very variable. The ground colour of the forewing is pale yellow or light yellow ochre and suffused dark grey. The basal and distal fasciae are dark brown. The basal fascia is bordered on the inner side by a brown cloud; the distal fascia has a brown cloud on the outer edge. There is also a brown cloud along the costa. There are two dark brown oblong spots in the upper half of the terminal area. The hindwing is grey white with grey suffusion. There is a grey-black discal spot on both wings. There are numerous and significant deviations from this colour pattern and some specimens are very dark. Truly melanic forms are also frequent. As with the peppered moth, the darker forms tend to be prevalent in industrial areas. Biology The adults have been recorded from September to December in the Great Britain and Ireland. Males are attracted to light. The larva is also variable from cream to dark brown. It feeds on a wide variety of trees and shrubs (see list below) and can be a serious pest in orchards.

Etymology  The word stems from Urdu (), which derives through Persian jam(a)dar from Arabic jamƒÅ‚Äòa(t) 'muster' + -dƒÅr 'holder'.  Pre-colonial  A jemadar was originally an armed official of a zamindar (feudal lord) in India who, like a military general, and along with Mridhas, was in charge of fighting and conducting warfare, mostly against the rebellious peasants and common people who lived on the lord's land. Also, this rank was used among the thuggees as well, usually the gang leader. Later, it became a rank used in the British Indian Army, where it was the lowest rank for a Viceroy's commissioned officer. Jemadars either commanded platoons or troops themselves or assisted their British commander. They also filled regimental positions such as assistant quartermaster (jemadar quartermaster) or assistant adjutant (jemadar adjutant).  Post-colonial  The rank remained in use in the Indian Army until 1965 as the lowest rank of junior commissioned officer. The rank of jemadar was later renamed in both the Indian Army and the Pakistan Army as naib subedar in infantry units, and naib risaldar in cavalry and armoured corps units.  Other uses  * Jemadar was also used in other contexts to denote Indian 'captains', like the leaders of thuggee bands who strangled travellers.Mike Dash, Thug: the true story of India's murderous cult, , 2005 * Jemadar was used as a rank title for an Indian inspector in the Shanghai Municipal Police * The name inspired that of the Star Trek race known as the \\"Jem'Hadar\\"  Sources  Military ranks of India Military ranks of Pakistan Military ranks of British India ","title":"Jemadar"},{"id":"1779158","text":"Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) is a radar technique using Radar imaging to generate a two-dimensional high resolution image of a target. It is analogous to conventional SAR, except that ISAR technology uses the movement of the target rather than the emitter to create the synthetic aperture. ISAR radars have a significant role aboard maritime patrol aircraft to provide them with radar image of sufficient quality to allow it to be used for target recognition purposes. In situations where other radars display only a single unidentifiable bright moving pixel, the ISAR image is often adequate to discriminate between various missiles, military aircraft, and civilian aircraft. Radar Cross Section (RCS) Imaging Images of the target region produced by ISAR can be a useful tool in locating scattering regions on the target. ISAR images are often produced by rotating the target and processing the resultant Doppler histories of the scattering centers. If the target rotates in azimuth at a constant rate through a 'small' angle, scatterers will approach or recede from the radar at a rate depending only on the cross range position- the distance normal to the radar line of sight with the origin at the target axis of rotation. The rotation will result in the generation of cross range dependent Doppler frequencies which can be sorted spatially by a Fourier transform. This operation is equivalent to (but the inverse of) the generation of a large synthetic aperture phased array antenna formed by the coherent summation of the receiver outputs for varying target / antenna geometries. For small angles, an ISAR image is the 2-dimensional Fourier transform of the received signal as a function of frequency and target aspect angle. If the target is rotated through 'large' angles, the Doppler frequency history of a scatterer becomes non linear, following a sine-wave trajectory. This Doppler history can not be processed directly by a Fourier transform because of the smeared Doppler frequency history resulting in the loss of cross range resolution. The maximum rotation angle which can be processed by an unmodified Fourier transform is determined by the constraint that the aperture phase error across the synthesized aperture should vary by less than a specified (arbitrary) amount, for example 45 degrees. This occurs when the synthetic aperture to the target range is less than required by the \\\\frac{2 D^2}{\\\\lambda} limit where D is the required lateral extent of the target. At this point the synthetic aperture is within the target nearfield region and requires focusing. The focusing is accomplished by applying a phase correction to the synthetic aperture. ISAR Applications ISAR is used in maritime surveillance for the classification of ships and other objects. In these applications the motion of the object due to wave action often plays a greater role than object rotation. For instance a feature which extends far over the surface of a ship such as a mast will provide a high sinusoidal response which is clearly identifiable in a two dimensional image. Images sometimes produce an uncanny similarity to a visual profile with the interesting effect that as the object rocks towards or away from the receiver the alternating doppler returns cause the profile to cycle between upright and inverted. ISAR for maritime surveillance was pioneered by Texas Instruments in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory and became an important capability of the P-3 Orion and the S-3B Viking US Navy aircraft. Research has been done also with land based ISAR. The difficulty in using this capability is that the object motion is far less in magnitude and usually less periodic than in the maritime case. Perhaps the most visually striking and scientifically compelling application of ISAR is in the deep space imaging of asteroids. A particularly beautiful example of this is the so-called \\"dog's bone\\" 216 Kleopatra asteroid, which lies roughly 20% further away from the earth than does the sun. The asteroid is only 60 miles wide at its midpoint. Yet the imagery is crisp and \\"feels\\" like an optical image. This has been cited as akin to using a Los Angeles telescope the size of the human eye's lens to image a car in New York. Of course the \\"trick\\" here is that the asteroid is presented among a very sparse background, allowing for substantial disambiguation. In February 2013, Indra Sistemas, a Spanish leading-technology corporation announced the first passive ISAR radar. A passive radar is characterised by not emitting any form of radiation, i.e., it uses the signals present in the environment. In this case, the radar uses Digital Terrestrial Television signals as the non- cooperative sources of illumination in the environment. Errors in ISAR Errors in the ISAR imaging process generally result in defocusing and geometry errors in the image. ISAR transform errors include: *Unknown target or antenna motion: Unmodeled motion will cause the target image to defocus and be at an incorrect location. This error is controlled by suitable mechanical design or by the use of auto-focus techniques. This error can be measured by the analytic signal phase measurement method described earlier. *Vertical nearfield errors: Unless 3D ISAR is performed, the vertical target extent at right angles to the horizontal synthetic aperture must fit within the vertical far field limit. Tall targets will defocus and move to incorrect positions. The 2D ISAR representation of a target region is a planar surface. *Integrated sidelobe return: ISAR image quality is degraded by range and azimuth compression side lobes. The sidelobes are due to data truncation and can be reduced by the application of appropriate window functions. The sidelobes can cause significant image degradation. First, the peaks of the stronger sidelobes may cause a string of progressively weaker targets to appear on either side of a strong target. Second, the combined power of all sidelobes tends to fog or washout detail in low RCS areas. The integrated sidelobe level can under poor conditions reach a level 10 dB below the peak target return. *Frequency and azimuth sampling errors: Incorrectly selected frequency or aspect deltas will result in aliased images, creating spurious targets. The SIM program described earlier specifically monitors for aliening errors effectively eliminating this error source. *Antenna aberrations: Aberrations in the geometry result when the antenna phase center position is dependent upon the antenna aspect or RF frequency. This error source is normally controlled by using small, simple antennas over narrow frequency bands at long ranges. First order corrections to frequency dispersive antennas such as log periodic can be handled by phase correcting the received signal. Full correction of the aberrations can be accomplished by a direct integration of the ISAR transform using the aberrated geometry. *Target dispersion: Dispersive targets have a non-minimum phase response, appearing to shift in position with RF frequency. Examples of dispersive targets include RF absorbers in which the absorption depth is a function of frequency and various antenna in which the phase center position is frequency dependent. CW ISAR imaging or in some cases preprocessing prior to a FMCW ISAR transform an eliminate dispersive defocusing of the target image. *Multipath: Multiple reflections can result in ISAR imaging distortions such as the classic ghost image trails from jet aircraft tail pipes. Errors in the 2D planar Inverse ISAR transform include: *Image blocking modeling errors: The Inverse ISAR transform currently assumes that scatterers are on a planar surface and cannot block other scatterers. *Image multipath modeling errors: The Inverse ISAR transform currently does not model the multipath environment. Note the current ISAR transforms also do not correctly process multipath.

The name comes from and , enteron, 'intestine', referring to the hollow body cavity common to these two phyla. They have very simple tissue organization, with only two layers of cells (external and internal), and radial symmetry. Some examples are corals, which are typically colonial, and hydra, jelly fish and sea anemones which are solitary. Coelenterata lack a specialized circulatory system relying instead on diffusion across the tissue layers.  Characteristics  All coelenterates are aquatic, mostly marine. The bodyform is radially symmetrical, diploblastic and does not have a coelom. The body has a single opening, the hypostome, surrounded by sensory tentacles equipped with either nematocysts or colloblasts to capture mostly planktonic prey. These tentacles are surrounded by a spacious cavity called the gastrovascular cavity or coelenteron. Digestion is both intracellular and extracellular. Respiration and excretion are accomplished by simple diffusion. A network of nerves is spread throughout the body. Many Cnidaria exhibit polymorphism, wherein different types of individuals are present in a colony for different functions. These individuals are called Zooids. These animals generally reproduce asexually by budding, though sexual reproduction does occur in some groups.  History of classification  The scientific validity of the term coelenterate is currently disputed, as the Cnidaria and Ctenophora have less in common than previously assumed. Coelentera may only be monophyletic if both Placozoa and Bilateria are included. In particular, the phylogenetic position of Ctenophora is controversial; it was first considered a sub-group of coelenterata but Hyman regarded it as a separate phylum. Some researchers suggest that Coelenterata is not monophyletic, and therefore any group containing Cnidaria and Ctenophora but excluding other phyla would be paraphyletic. However, some genomic studies have found support for monophyletic coelenterates. Despite this uncertainty, the term coelenterate is still used in informal settings to refer to the Cnidaria and Ctenophora. Complicating the issue is the 1997 work of Lynn Margulis (revising an earlier model by Thomas Cavalier-Smith) that placed the Cnidaria and Ctenophora alone in the branch Radiata within Eumetazoa.Margulis, Lynn and Karlene V. Schwartz, 1997, Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth, W.H.

The D-isomer, occurring more commonly in nature as the fragrance of oranges, is a flavoring agent in food manufacturing. It is also used in chemical synthesis as a precursor to carvone and as a renewables-based solvent in cleaning products. The less common L-isomer is found in mint oils and has a piny, turpentine-like odor. The compound is one of the main volatile monoterpenes found in the resin of conifers, particularly in the Pinaceae, and of orange oil. Limonene takes its name from French limon (\\"lemon\\").Merriam-Webster's dictionary entry for \\"limonene\\". Accessedon 2020-03-16. Limonene is a chiral molecule, and biological sources produce one enantiomer: the principal industrial source, citrus fruit, contains D-limonene ((+)-limonene), which is the (R)-enantiomer. Racemic limonene is known as dipentene. D-Limonene is obtained commercially from citrus fruits through two primary methods: centrifugal separation or steam distillation. Chemical reactions Limonene is a relatively stable monoterpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene. It oxidizes easily in moist air to produce carveol, carvone, and limonene oxide. With sulfur, it undergoes dehydrogenation to p-cymene. Limonene occurs commonly as the D\\\\- or (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes to dipentene at 300 ¬∞C. When warmed with mineral acid, limonene isomerizes to the conjugated diene Œ±-terpinene (which can also easily be converted to p-cymene). Evidence for this isomerization includes the formation of Diels‚ÄìAlder adducts between Œ±-terpinene adducts and maleic anhydride. It is possible to effect reaction at one of the double bonds selectively. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride reacts preferentially at the disubstituted alkene, whereas epoxidation with mCPBA occurs at the trisubstituted alkene. In another synthetic method Markovnikov addition of trifluoroacetic acid followed by hydrolysis of the acetate gives terpineol. =Biosynthesis= In nature, limonene is formed from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclization of a neryl carbocation or its equivalent as shown. The final step involves loss of a proton from the cation to form the alkene. center[Biosynthesis of limonene from geranyl pyrophosphate The most widely practiced conversion of limonene is to carvone. The three-step reaction begins with the regioselective addition of nitrosyl chloride across the trisubstituted double bond. This species is then converted to the oxime with a base, and the hydroxylamine is removed to give the ketone-containing carvone. In plants D-Limonene is a major component of the aromatic scents and resins characteristic of numerous coniferous and broadleaved trees: red and silver maple (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum), cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia), aspens (Populus grandidentata, Populus tremuloides) sumac (Rhus glabra), spruce (Picea spp.), various pines (e.g., Pinus echinata, Pinus ponderosa), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), larches (Larix spp.), true firs (Abies spp.), hemlocks (Tsuga spp.), cannabis (Cannabis sativa spp.), cedars (Cedrus spp.), various Cupressaceae, and juniper bush (Juniperus spp.). It contributes to the characteristic odor of orange peel, orange juice and other citrus fruits. To optimize recovery of valued components from citrus peel waste, d-limonene is typically removed. Safety and research D-Limonene applied to skin may cause irritation from contact dermatitis, but otherwise appears to be safe for human uses. Limonene is flammable as a liquid or vapor and it is toxic to aquatic life. Uses Limonene is common as a dietary supplement and as a fragrance ingredient for cosmetics products. As the main fragrance of citrus peels, D-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, such as a flavoring to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other personal care products. D-Limonene is also used as a botanical insecticide.EPA Fact Sheet on Limonene, September 1994 D-Limonene is used in the organic herbicide \\"Avenger\\".Avenger Material Safety Data Sheet http://nebula.wsimg.com/07de45c0af774ba73e06362ad1a56f06?AccessKeyId=C67FD801C8FC93742D64&disposition;=0&alloworigin;=1 It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon or orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, L-limonene has a piny, turpentine-like odor. Limonene is used as a solvent for cleaning purposes, such as adhesive remover, or the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus essential oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It is used as a paint stripper and is also useful as a fragrant alternative to turpentine. Limonene is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues and as a constituent in some paints. Commercial air fresheners, with air propellants, containing limonene are used by philatelists to remove self-adhesive postage stamps from envelope paper. Limonene is also used as a solvent for fused filament fabrication based 3D printing.

It ran from 1965 to 1979 and was set in the fictional townland of Leestown in County Kilkenny. Its location filming with Outside Broadcast Units, rather than using only TV studios, broke the mould of broadcasting in the soap opera genre and inspired the creation of its British equivalent, Emmerdale Farm (now called Emmerdale) by Yorkshire Television in 1972. Plot The show was called The Riordans after the name of the central family, who were two middle-aged parents, Tom Riordan and his wife Mary, together with their oldest son, Benjy and other siblings including brother Michael and sister Jude, all of whom except Benjy had left farming for other careers and had more adventurous personal lives. Other leading characters included the family doctor, his Protestant gentry-born wife, the (radical Vatican II-oriented) Catholic priest, the conservative Church of Ireland rector, the local pub owner, some nomadic Irish Travellers and others.

Its success was immediate, with its actors becoming household names. One year later, aware that Ireland was still a largely rural country, and of the immense popularity of rural-based radio shows on RT√â Radio (then called Radio √âireann), notably The Kennedys of Castleross Telef√≠s √âireann decided to create a new rural soap opera, set on a family farm. Located in Dunboyne, The Flathouse, owned by the Connolly family, was the setting for this programme. Christopher Fitz-Simons was the show's first executive producer.http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv- radio/a-trip-down-tvs-memory-lane-27901258.html The drama was written by James Douglas and later Wesley Burrowes, who derived much of his inspiration from engaging with and observing the lives of the locals in Kells, County Kilkenny. Part of the success of the series was because many of the leading actors were themselves from the background they represented. John Cowley, who played the patriarch of the family, Tom Riordan was from real farming stock in Ardbraccan in County Meath and many of the issues his character had to deal with reflected his own life experiences in rural Ireland. Actor Tom Hickey, who played Benjy was from County Kildare in the midlands and also had personal experience of life in the part of the country in which the programme was set. Among the many series writers were James Douglas (the creator of the show), Wesley Burrowes, Pat O'Connor, Eugene McCabe, and Tom Coffey =Filming= The Riordans proved to be a revolutionary television programme, both in Ireland and internationally. Its most dramatic innovation was in the use of OBUs (Outside Broadcast Units) to film most of each episode on location in the countryside. This was a marked innovation. Previously soap operas had all been studio-based, with even supposed exterior filming all done with studio sets built in sound stages.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/emmerdale-the- village-that-won-over-a-nation-408011.html'On location' filming was up to that point avoided for technical and financial reasons; firstly on location filming was reliant on weather conditions, which meant it was difficult to manage costs. Secondly costs of transporting sets, wardrobe, cameras, and film made on location shooting more expensive, while the extra time involved in transporting edited footage back to studio, in the days before satellite links, also meant that on location shoots, unless taking place beside the studio, were avoided. Thirdly, recording sound was thought to be more complicated in an open environment, and much easier on closed studio sound stages. Telef√≠s √âireann decided however to film most of The Riordans on location given that creating a farm set was not possible around the Dublin city studios at Montrose. Even if space had been available, it would have been impossible to mask the city sounds (traffic, aeroplanes overhead, Garda S√≠och√°na (police) sirens, etc.). However to speed up the process of getting the film back to studio for editing, it filmed the programme on a farm near Dunboyne in County Meath, even though it set it in County Kilkenny, which was further away. In 1975 the programme began to be filmed and transmitted in colour, having been available in monochrome only up to then.\\"Irish TV The Story of Irish Television\\" Irish TV.com Influence on other shows The successful use of OBUs to film The Riordans made international waves in broadcasting, given that all soap operas elsewhere, notably Coronation Street, were entirely studio-based. In the early 1970s, Yorkshire Television, which, aware of the success of The Riordans, was planning its own rural-based soap opera, travelled to Ireland to see how The Riordans was made on location. Its new soap, Emmerdale Farm (in 1989 renamed Emmerdale) was heavily influenced by what its makers had learnt from watching the making of The Riordans.http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/the-plough-and-the-stars-how- tvs-revolutionary-riordans-changed-ireland-26512103.html By the late 1970s and 1980s, first Coronation Street, then EastEnders and most dramatically Brookside were influenced in their greater use (or in the case of Brookside complete use) of on location filming started by The Riordans and brought to Britain by Emmerdale Farm.  Recurring themes  As with all soap operas, The Riordans was centred on various tensions, rivalries and relationships. Among the central ones were * generational - conservative parents (Tom and Mary) and radical young son and heir (Benjy); Batty Brennan and his wife Minnie Brennan, as the old people in the community, against everyone else. * mother versus son - Mary against Benjy, which some critics likened to John Millington Synge's The Playboy of the Western World; * liberal versus conservative - radical priest Father Sheehy versus his older parishioners; conservative parents Tom and Mary against liberal children Michael and Jude; conservative Catholic Tom and Mary versus their contraception-using daughter-in-law, Maggie Riordan; * outsider versus insider - the Riordan family, with their middle class farming background, against orphan Maggie, wife of Benjy; members of the nomadic Irish traveller community versus the settled, non-nomadic farming community; * Class - well-to-do characters like the Church of Ireland upper middle class wife of the doctor, Mrs. Howard, and the middle class farming Riordans, against farm labourers Batty Brennan and Eamonn Maher. * community gossip - as with most soaps, The Riordans contained a 'local gossip' character, Minnie Brennan, who, typically for such characters, proclaimed no interest in gossip at all, but nevertheless became the source of local information on the lives and loves of the community. One additional twist to the series was that the elderly gossip, Mrs Brennan, though considerably older than all the other characters (and actors) in the series except her onscreen 'husband' Batty Brennan (he had to be written out of the series suddenly when the actor playing him died), was played by the elderly Annie D'Alton, the real-life wife of John Cowley, Tom Riordan, the lead middle aged character. The striking difference in ages of the couple (she was his senior by twenty years, and as Minnie Brennan was made to look even older through make-up) became a source of comment among viewers, as some noted in letters to the show that she was old enough on screen to convincingly play his mother.http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb- news/tradition-of-family-drama-dates-back-to-the-riordans-26099822.html Local actors included Peter Greene, who played a young boy always in trouble. Many other locals were cast during the many seasons. =Pushing agendas= Irish broadcasting in the 1960s and 1970s reflected the clash of ideas between elements of traditional rural Catholic society and new liberal ideas coming from the United States, Britain and Catholicism itself through the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Conservatives within RT√â associated with the Knights of Columbanus clashed with liberals and with Marxists associated with Official Sinn F√©in, over the content of programmes, through the extent to which the ultimate liberal victory was a product of one side infiltrating the station more successfully than the other is disputed, with one academic saying that the liberal win represented only the triumph of the 'liberal consensus'.'Soap Opera and Social Order: Glenroe, Fair City and Contemporary Ireland' by Dr. Dr Helena Sheehan. A paper given at IMAGINING IRELAND conference, Irish Film Centre, Dublin, 31 October 1993 However, then-leading OSF intellectual Eoghan Harris suggests that left-wing radicalism was of crucial importance in shaping RT√â's output in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The Riordans tackled many 'conservative versus liberal' issues from its very start. Its start coincided with the coming into force of the Succession Act which for the first time granted to the wife of a farmer an automatic right of succession to the family farm, so removing the danger that after her husband's death she could be left with nothing, with the property being willed to a total stranger. The issue was at the time controversial; banks until the 1970s would not allow a wife to open a bank account except with the approval of her husband. Conservatives suggested that the new Act, which had been pushed through in the face of opposition by then Minister for Justice Charles Haughey, would undermine the traditional family and lead to the sale of a farm owned by a family, were a farmer's marriage to break up. Liberals argued that the reform was one of social justice and a long-overdue recognition of the rights of farmers' wives. In the words of academic Dr Finola Kennedy, The Riordans \\"introduced one of the most sensitive issues in rural family life ‚Äì the links between property, farm ownership and marriage at the very time of the debate on the Succession Bill\\".Finola Kennedy, Cottage to Cr√®che: Family Change in Ireland (Dublin: Institute of Public Administration, 2001) pp. 302\\\\. Price: ‚Ç¨30.47 The show also focused on a range of farming issues, from the promotion of new farm technology to safety on farms. (In the 1970s Tom and Benjy featured in a television advertisement urging farmers to have metal- framed cabs put onto their tractors to protect themselves from serious injury should the vehicle overturn.) Other issues were also raised, such as illegitimacy, poverty, the problems of old age, marriage break-up, sexual activity, the dramatic changes in the post-Vatican II Catholic Church, and most famously contraception, when it was revealed that Benjy's wife, Maggie, for medical reasons could not risk having a second pregnancy. The decision of the couple to use contraception (the Pill) caused considerable controversy and criticism from \\"family values\\" organisations and some in the Catholic Church. The show was on many issues both praised and criticised in the national media and even in D√°il √âireann.D√°il √âireann - Volume 220 - 1 February 1966 Private Members' Business. - Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1965: Second Stage (Resumed) D√°il √âireann - Volume 257 - 24 November 1971 Moreover, civil servants in the mid-1960s criticised the image portrayed of a 'farm advisor' sent out to advise farmers on new advances in farming but who in the series was seen drinking in the pub and gossiping.Irish Independent report on release of state papers containing file on civil service criticism of The Riordans Axing controversy The show underwent a number of changes in the mid-1970s, most notably moving from a half-hour to one-hour format, as well as a change in theme tune. The music originally used to introduce each episode was Se√≥irse Bodley's orchestral arrangement of the Irish traditional tune, \\"The Palatine's Daughter\\".Ceolta √âireann CD The decision of the actor Tom Hickey to leave the series caused some problems. His character, Benjy was not killed off but went abroad \\"on the missions\\" (i.e., to work with the Catholic Church in Africa). A new farm labourer, played by new actor Gabriel Byrne, was introduced in 1978 and he played the love-interest for Maggie, Benjy's wife, who had remained after refusing to go to Africa with him. While the show had declined somewhat from its heyday, it still regularly battled with The Late Late Show to top the TAM ratings and was itself surprised when one episode, which unusually departed from the 1970s and focused on Tom Riordan as a young man in the 1930s at a family c√©il√≠, was critically acclaimed by the media and many older viewers, who viewed it as an accurate representation of life on an Irish farm in the 1930s and 1940s. With its considerable popularity, large cast of respected actors and high production values, and its central location on the schedules of RT√â 1, few expected the show to be axed, let alone so suddenly. There was however considerable surprise, and a lot of criticism, when the new Director of Programming at RT√â, Muiris MacConghail decided that the show had run its course and so axed it. Part of the justification was cost: it was one of RT√â's most expensive shows to make. With the launch of RT√â 2 in 1978 the station believed that it needed to produce more shows for its limited budget as a small station, and it could not do that if The Riordans took up much of the budget. Critics however suggested that RT√â had failed to market the show internationally and that, given the size of the Irish diaspora internationally, all interested in 'home', it could have had an international market among stations in countries with large Irish audiences, with its sale recouping much of the cost involved in its making. The public, the media and politicians all criticised the axing of one of the most popular shows on RT√â. However, notwithstanding the outcry, and condemnation by John Cowley who argued that the cast had been badly treated, the last television episode was broadcast on RT√â television in May 1979. Fine Gael TD Tom Enright, during a 1980 debate in D√°il √âireann said of the decision: :‚ÄúThe Riordans‚Äù, one of the finest programmes that I can remember seeing and was most enjoyable, was dropped from television some time ago. It touched on many important social aspects of not just rural Irish life but all aspects of Irish life. It incorporated many delicate matters and matters which people shied away from and it was an in-depth study of life in Ireland. I am certain that the cost factor had a lot to do with the removal of this programme, but it was a mistake to remove it and this is evident when we see some of the programmes that replace it on the television service.D√°il √âireann - Volume 324 - 18 November 1980 The show was resurrected for RT√â Radio 1 as a fifteen-minute daily show where it lasted a few years. The move to radio allowed some of the older actors to retire, while departed characters, such as Benjy, could be brought back, albeit not with the original actors but with actors who sounded like the person who played them in the television series. The Riordans was later dropped from the radio schedules as part of a re-organisation of the schedules. The series was replaced by a spin-off series Bracken, which saw Gabriel Byrne's character move from Kilkenny to Wicklow. Bracken became the second in a trilogy of agricultural soaps/dramas produced by RT√â, the final such soap being Glenroe. While occasional media reports have wondered whether the show should return, notably when the independent TV3 was launched and was seeking to capture the audience, something it might have done had it had The Riordans in its schedule, there is in reality little chance of its return, given the death of some of its leading actors, including John Cowley (Tom Riordan), Chris O'Neill (Michael Riordan), Moira Deady, (Mary Riordan), Annie D'Alton (Minnie Brennan), Tony Doyle (Fr. Sheehy), Joe Pilkington (Eamon Maher), Christopher Casson (The Rector), Jack O'Reilly (Johnny Mac) and Biddy White Lennon (Maggie Riordan) as well as the unavailability of Tom Hickey (who does not want to reprise his role of Benjy) and Gabriel Byrne, now a Hollywood actor. Legacy The final 26 episodes of The Riordans was shown in about 1980 on the various ITV regions - for the most part, in most areas, it was shown three times a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 12:30 - most regions temporarily dropped Australian wartime drama The Sullivans, which had been aired in that timeslot in most regions, to accommodate The Riordans. In London region, the series was only screen weekly on Monday finishing on 12 October 1981. In the Tyne Tees region, The Sullivans continued to air on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:30, but The Riordans aired on Wednesdays only - they gradually fell behind the network as a result. It was dropped from that timeslot after a while - only to continue in the 3:45 slot on Tuesday afternoons (a brief narrated refresher course was provided) and carried on in that slot until the final episode. The Riordans was a key development in late 20th century television drama, because, as well as giving RT√â its first experience of how to create a long-running soap opera, its use of OBUs changed the methodology by which later soaps in both Britain and Ireland were made. It embodied the changing Ireland of its period. When it was first broadcast, the reforming Se√°n Lemass was Taoiseach. When it finished, his son-in-law - the controversial Charles Haughey - was months from becoming Taoiseach. The Riordans covered a period of rapid transition in Irish life, from an agrarian, protectionist Ireland of the early 1960s to membership of the European Economic Community and so a rapidly changing rural economy in the 1970s. In the 1960s, Ireland was still rural, conservative and Catholic, with storylines like a character going on the Pill containing a shock value unthinkable a decade later. By the late 1970s, Ireland was becoming less rural, less conservative and less Catholic. Ironically, one of the biggest shock issues of the early show, the use of contraception, became less of a shock when in 1979 the provision of contraception was legalised, albeit with tight controls, in the very year the show was taken off air. The changing nature of Irish society was shown in the soap operas that replaced The Riordans. After the short interregnum Bracken, came Glenroe, another 'rural' show set, unlike The Riordans, on the fringes of a town close to Dublin, with some characters living in an urban housing estate. Even the central characters, a farmer and his father Miley Byrne and Dinny Byrne, blurred the urban and rural worlds in a way that Tom Riordan never did, by turning their farm into an open farm for urban people to visit, and selling their produce in their own shop in the local town. After two decades that show itself was axed, leaving RT√â with only one major homegrown soap opera, one that has no rural aspect at all, and is set in inner-city Dublin, Fair City. =Rural drama on RT√â= From the Kennedys of Castleross on radio to The Riordans on television, RT√â had focused heavily on rural life as a context for its soap operas. The axing of The Riordans was not however the end of rural soaps on RT√â. A spin-off series, Bracken was launched around Pat Barry (Gabriel Byrne), and which featured Irish actor Niall Toibin, Mick Lally and former Coronation Street actor Joe Lynch (who had played a lover of the Street's Elsie Tanner). After two series, that show was replaced as planned by its own spin-off, Glenroe, which followed the Lally and Lynch characters as they moved from the fictional townland of Bracken to the outskirts of the fictional town of Glenroe. The axing of Glenroe in 2001 brought to an end the tradition of rural soap operas on RT√â. Since the axing of Glenroe RT√â have focused on the urban soap opera Fair City, which not only touched on the same themes as Tolka Row thirty years earlier but even starred one of the stars of the earlier urban drama in a new role. However, rural drama remains as strong source of material as seen in On Home Ground (2001‚Äì2002), Pure Mule (2005‚Äì2009) and the popular detective series Single-Handed (2007 - date). One of Ireland's most successful screenwriters, Wesley Burrowes, having been responsible for much of the output on The Riordans, was the creator of both Bracken and Glenroe. Some of those associated as writers and directors with The Riordans went on to have successful film and stage careers, including novelist, playwright and screenwriter, Eugene McCabe, playwright Joe O'Donnell, and filmmaker Pat O'Connor. =Missing Episodes= A controversial policy of RT√â's in the 1960s and 1970s led to the erasing of previous episodes of old programmes, so that the expensive video that had been used to record them could be reused. As a result, little remains of RT√â's 1960s output, with shows like The Riordans, The Late Late Show and others routinely wiped after broadcast.http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/meathsouth/articles/2009/02/04/35685-remembering- the-riordans034/ However some 1960s episodes remain, as do many from the 1970s. =Later careers of the actors= Some of the actors had distinguished careers after the axing of The Riordans. * After Bracken Gabriel Byrne went to the United States where he became a successful film actor. * Tony Doyle, Father Sheehy, who had left the series in the mid-1970s, became a successful television actor with the BBC, starring in among other shows Ballykissangel, before dying suddenly aged 58 on the brink of his biggest television role yet. * John Cowley worked largely in films, playing \\"the auctioneer\\" in John B. Keane's The Field with Richard Harris and also on stage. Cowley also continued with his lifelong campaign against coursing and other blood sports. He died in 1998. * Annie D'Alton, Minnie Brennan, who was Cowley's much older wife in real life, died in 1983. * Chris O'Neill, Michael Riordan, worked for some years as agent for Gabriel Byrne.

The free-flowing, poetic novel is a largely autobiographical account of a man's journey through the Parisian underworld. The characters are drawn after their real-life counterparts, who are mostly homosexuals living on the fringes of society. Plot summary The novel tells the story of Divine, a drag queen who, when the novel opens, has died of tuberculosis and been canonised as a result. The narrator tells us that the stories he is telling are mainly to amuse himself whilst he passes his sentence in prison ‚Äì and the highly erotic, often explicitly sexual, stories are spun to assist his masturbation. Jean-Paul Sartre called it \\"the epic of masturbation\\". Divine lives in an attic room overlooking Montmartre cemetery, which she shares with various lovers, the most important of whom is a pimp called Darling Daintyfoot. One day Darling brings home a young hoodlum and murderer, dubbed Our Lady of the Flowers. Our Lady is eventually arrested and tried, and executed. Death and ecstasy accompany the acts of every character, as Genet performs a transvaluation of all values, making betrayal the highest moral value, murder an act of virtue and sexual appeal. Publication history and reception Our Lady of the Flowers was written in prison. Genet wrote it on sheets of brown paper which prison authorities provided to prisoners ‚Äì with the intention that they would make bags of it. As recounted by Sartre in his foreword to Our Lady of the Flowers, a prison guard discovered that the prisoner Genet had been making this \\"unauthorized\\" use of the paper, confiscated the manuscript and burned it. Undaunted, Genet wrote it all over again. The second version survived and Genet took it with him when leaving the prison.Sartre Forward to the 1951 Gallimard edition, here quoted from the 1964 Bantam English translation. Largely completed in 1942, the book was first published anonymously by Robert Deno√´l and Paul Moribien at the end of 1943, though only about 30 copies of the first edition were bound in that year (most began to be bound and sold in August 1944, during the Liberation). The first printing was designed for sale to well-to-do collectors of erotica; it circulated by private sales lists and under the counter. But Genet never intended his work as mere pornography and later excised more graphic passages. In November 1943, he sent a copy of the first printing to Marc Barbezat, publisher of the literary journal L'Arbalete, who published the book in 1944 and again in 1948. Genet revised the novel when it was published by Gallimard in 1951; the Gallimard edition omits some of the more pornographic passages in the novel. Later L'Arbalete editions include a number of smaller revisions. The novel is dedicated to the convicted and executed murderer Maurice Pilorge. Literary influence The novel was an enormous influence on the Beats, with its free-flowing, highly poetic language mixed with argot/slang, and its celebration of lowlifes and explicit descriptions of homosexuality. It is elegantly transgressive, and its self-reflexive nature prefigures the approach to language developed later by the post-structuralists. Jacques Derrida wrote on Genet in his book Glas, and H√©l√®ne Cixous celebrated his work as an example of √©criture feminine. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote his famous Saint Genet as an analysis of Genet's work and life but most especially of Our Lady of the Flowers. Our Lady of the Flowers made Genet, in Sartre's mind at least, a poster child of existentialism and most especially an embodiment of that philosophy's views on freedom. Adaptations Lindsay Kemp did a production of Flowers. A pantomime for Jean Genet (based on Our Lady of the Flowers by Jean Genet) in 1974 at the Bush Theatre, London; he subsequently toured it in the United States and Australia. In popular culture In Nigel Williams' Scenes from a Poisoner's Life (1994), the main protagonist gives Our Lady of the Flowers to his homosexual brother as a Christmas present. The performer, actor, and drag queen Divine was named after the main character of the book. Filmmaker John Waters gave her this nickname after reading Genet's novel. The Pogues have a song titled \\"Hell's Ditch,\\" which contains references to the novel. Placebo's self-titled debut album features a song called \\"Lady Of The Flowers.\\" Cocorosie's song \\"Beautiful Boyz\\" is believed to be about it. Sopor Aeternus & the Ensemble of Shadows' album Les Fleurs du Mal ‚Äì Die Blumen des B√∂sen was greatly inspired by the book. Pete Doherty used a quote from the book in his song, \\"Last Of The English Roses.\\" Primal Scream have a song titled \\"Dolls (sweet Rock 'n' Roll)\\" in which the name of the novel is mentioned. David Bowie was under the influence of this novel and referred to it in his song 'The Jean Genie'.

He also married, in succession, two survivors of the Donner Party. Biography =Early life and education= Houghton was born in New York City, on April 10, 1828. He completed preparatory studies and attended Collegiate Institute in New York. =Career= During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Houghton enlisted in the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers, in June 1846. He arrived in San Francisco, California in 1847 with the rest of his regiment after sailing around Cape Horn. The regiment garrisoned Santa Barbara, before capturing the city of La Paz in Baja California. He was honorably discharged as a lieutenant at Monterey, California, in October 1848. Houghton then proceeded to mine for gold during the California Gold Rush, and after about six months of mining, he moved to San Jose and entered various commercial businesses. He served as the deputy clerk of the Supreme Court of California in 1854, the same year he was elected to the San Jose Common Council. He was elected the fourth Mayor of San Jose, California from 1855 to 1856. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857, and commenced practice in San Jose. During the Civil War he was commissioned as a captain and promoted to lieutenant colonel, and served successively as inspector and ordnance officer. After the war, he was elected as a Republican to the Forty-second and Forty-third Congresses (March 4, 1871 ‚Äì March 3, 1875) and was the chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures for the Forty-third Congress. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1874 to the Forty-fourth Congress. He was appointed commissioner to investigate the affairs of the United States Mint at San Francisco in 1881, and moved to Los Angeles in 1886 and continued the practice of law. Personal life In 1859, he married Mary Martha Donner, a survivor of the Donner Party; she died a year later, most likely from complications related to the birth of their only child, also named Mary. In 1861, he married his late wife's first cousin and fellow Donner Party survivor Eliza Poor Donner, with whom he had an additional seven children. Death Sherman Houghton died on August 31, 1914, aged 86, in Compton, California. He is interred in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles. Legacy The Donner- Houghton House, an historic building in downtown San Jose, was built by Houghton in 1881. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Published monthly, it was D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd's third all-reprint comic. It replaced The Best of Topper and The Best of Beezer, which had reprinted old strips for some years. Classics from the Comics collected archive comic strips from eight comic titles ‚Äì the still going The Beano and The Dandy, and the defunct Beezer, Topper, Nutty, Sparky, Cracker, and Buzz. During its later issues, adventure comics from the likes of The Victor, The Wizard, The Rover, The Hotspur and The Hornet were used. It also started using Hoot! shortly before it ended. The comic had 64 pages, which were prefaced with a contents page (\\"Classic Contents\\") and until 2007 were followed by an advert for the next month's issue, with the back cover showing original strips starring Roger the Dodger, Little Plum, Plug, Beryl the Peril amongst others, drawn by Gordon Bell or Keith Reynolds. In 2006, the cover was redesigned to show \\"Classics from the Comics\\" with a roundel containing Korky the Cat's head and the words Classics Collection, and a large illustration by Ken H. Harrison. The new editor started penning a letter to the readers on the contents page, and the advert and original strip on the inside and back covers were replaced by further reprinted strips, which are always Korky the Cat and Biffo the Bear. A small notice was published on all the pages, identifying which comic the strip comes from (Classic Beano, Classic Dandy, etc.). Near the end of each issue, a \\"Readers Requests\\" postal address was displayed, so readers could write to DC Thomson and request other archive strips to go in a future issue. Free gifts in the form of The Fun Size Beanos or The Fun Size Dandys were featured in early issues, plus free gifts originally given away with The Beano or The Dandy. In July 2004 Classics from the Comics celebrated its 100th issue, revamping the front cover at the same time, changing the logo from a plain serif font to a sans-serif one with a 3-D effect. The August 2008 issue was a Beano special, featuring only characters from that 70-year-old comic. It featured the oldest (Ping the Elastic Man and Deep Down Daddy Neptune, 1938), and most recent stories (specifically the picture of Dennis, Gnasher, Wallace & Gromit from the Beano printed only the previous day; the most recent actual story was \\"Crazy for Daisy\\" from 2003) ever used. For this issue, the usual Korky roundel was replaced with the logo from the 70 Years of Fun collector's edition. 'D. C. Thomson & Co.

The ELA dissolved in the early 1990s, and the Revolutionary Nuclei emerged in 1995 and remained heavily active through 2000. After a long hiatus, the group was credited with also carrying out an attack in 2009. This group opposed US military occupation and involvement in Greece. Both the Revolutionary Nuclei and its preceding Revolutionary People's Struggle were leftist groups. Both of these leftist terrorist groups opposed capitalism. The prevalence of left-wing terrorist organizations in Greece is thought to be a backlash to the military rule that prevailed until 1974.  Claimed Attacks  The 1996 attack on Citibank was the first incident credited to the Revolutionary Nuclei. The group was responsible for an attack on a government building in 1997. They were very active in 1998, with three separate incidents. One involved a government target, while the other two were attacks on businesses. The other two occurred on the same day at banks at two different locations. In 1999, the group launched a deadly attack at the Intercontinental Hotel. Members of the Greek government were attending an Economic Round-table at the hotel. One other person was injured in the course of the attack. Later that same year, the group bombed the office of Texaco in Athens. The group was most active in 2000, with five attacks occurring. The most notable aspect of these attacks was the use of time bombs. 12 November saw three attacks across the city of Athens. The Revolutionary Nuclei once again attacked a Barclays Bank and Citibank location. No injuries were reported, but damage was caused to the buildings. The third attack on that day was against an art studio, which resulted in property damage.  Weapons  The Revolutionary Nuclei made exclusive use of bombs in their terrorist activities. In some of their attacks, the bombs were able to be defused before they detonated. The group is responsible for one casualty and twelve instances of property damage.

It is about to the southwest of Australia and is nearly three times the size of Japan. The plateau extends for more than in a northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction and lies in deep water. The plateau was produced by the Kerguelen hotspot, starting with or following the breakup of Gondwana about 130 million years ago. A small portion of the plateau breaks sea level, forming the Kerguelen Islands (a French overseas territory) plus the Heard and McDonald Islands (an Australian external territory). Intermittent volcanism continues on the Heard and McDonald Islands. Geographical extent Kerguelen Plateau Topography Symmetrically across the Indian Ocean ridge and due west of Australia is the Broken Ridge underwater volcanic plateau, which at one time was contiguous with the Kerguelen Plateau before rifting by the mid-ocean ridge. To the north of Broken Ridge is the linear Ninety East Ridge which continues almost due north into the Bay of Bengal and is considered to be a hotspot track. One of the largest igneous provinces (LIPs) in the world, the Kerguelen Plateau covers an area of and rises above the surrounding oceanic basins. Located on the Antarctic Plate, the Kerguelen Plateau is separated from Australia by the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) and from Africa by the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR). These two ridges meet at the Rodriguez Triple Junction. It is separated from Antarctica by Princess Elizabeth Trough and the Cooperation Sea. The eastern margin north of the William Ridge is steep and formed during the breakup between the Kerguelen Plateau and the Broken Ridge. The southern part of the margin is separated from the Australian‚ÄìAntarctic Basin by the deep Labuan Basin. Geological history From the initial opening of the Indian Ocean until present, the Kerguelen hotspot has produced several now widely dispersed large-scale structures. The Southern Kerguelen Plateau (SKP) formed 119‚Äì110 ; the Elan Bank 108‚Äì107 , named by Dennis E. Hayes of Lamont Doherty Easth Observatory; the Central Kerguelen Plateau (CKP) 101‚Äì100 ; the Broken Ridge (connected to the CKP before the Eocene breakup) 95‚Äì94 ; the Skiff Bank (east of the Kerguelen Islands) 69‚Äì68 ; the Northern Kerguelen Plateau (NKP) 35‚Äì34 ; the Ninety East Ridge formed 82‚Äì38 north to south; the Bunbury Basalt (Western Australia) 137-130.5 ; the Naturaliste Plateau (offshore Western Australia) formed 132-128 ; the Rajmahal Traps in Northeast India 118‚Äì117 ; and finally lamprophyres in India and Antarctica 115‚Äì114 . =India‚ÄìAustralia breakup= The oldest volcanism that can be attributed to the Kerguelen plume are the Bunbury Basalt (137-130.5 ) and Naturaliste Plateau (132-128 ) in southwestern Australia, and the Rajmahal Traps in eastern India (118 ). The formation of the oldest portion of the Kerguelen LIP and these continental basalts are linked to the opening of the eastern Indian Ocean. The Bunbury Basalt is not of flood basalt dimensions which suggests that the mantle underlying the newly formed Kerguelen hotspot was neither significantly hot, wet, or voluminous. In contrast, the magmatism that produced the Australia‚ÄìIndia breakup 136‚Äì158 created the Wallaby Plateau, but no known hotspot has been linked to this event. =India‚ÄìAntarctica breakup= The output from the Kerguelen hotspot peaked 120‚Äì95 , 12‚Äì70 after the India‚ÄìAntarctica breakup. No ridges or hotspot tracks such as Walvis‚ÄìRio Grande, Chagos‚ÄìLaccadive, Greenland‚ÄìScotland have been found in the Princess Elizabeth Trough between SKP and Antarctica or along India's conjugate eastern continental margin. The relation between the Kerguelen hotspot and these continental breakup and volcanic margins is instead similar to that between the R√©union hotspot and the Deccan Traps and the breakup between western India and the Seychelles. The peak output of the Kerguelen hotspot coincides with one or several microcontinent formations, such as the Elan Bank. Since the Indian Ocean began to open about 130 , the Kerguelen hotspot has moved 3‚Äì10¬∞ southward and, consequently, the spreading ridge between India and Antarctica has jumped northward one or several times. Parts of the Kerguelen Plateau, the Elan Bank and the SKP, were originally attached to India and are composed of continental lithosphere. One or several ridge jumps transformed the Elan Bank into a microcontinent and dispersed continental fragments in the SKP, and these structures were eventually left behind as India moved northward. The ridge jump that made the Elan Bank a microcontinent occurred after 124 . The development of the Southern Kerguelen Plateau 118‚Äì119 contributed to the oceanic anoxic event 1. Around 83.5 sea floor spreading between India and Antarctica was asymmetric in the Kerguelen Plateau region with two-thirds of the sea floor created being added to the Antarctic Plate. A ridge jump eventually transferred parts of the Kerguelen Plateau from the Indian Plate to the Antarctic Plate. =Cenozoic volcanism= The Kerguelen hotspot produced the long Ninety East Ridge 82‚Äì38 , and geochemical evidence suggests that this occurred at or near a spreading ridge. The lack of a conjugate structure on the Antarctic Plate, however, makes it unlikely that the hotspot was located at a spreading ridge during this long period. As the Antarctic Plate then moved over the Kerguelen hotspot the NKP formed over relatively old oceanic crust. Flood basalts in the Kerguelen archipelago formed 30‚Äì24 and less voluminous and more recent volcanism occurred until 1 . During the last 21 volcanic structures have formed on the CKP, including Heard Island, and both Heard and McDonald Islands have had recent eruptions. 65 , the CKP‚ÄìBroken Ridge LIP was located near the Kerguelen plume and the plate boundaries of the Indian Ocean. The LIP was the product of 25 of relatively high magmatic activity followed by a 40 period of lower activity. Microcontinent described tilted basement blocks near the Kerguelen archipelago and were the first to identify the Kerguelen Plateau as of continental origin, in contrast to other LIPs.: Toutes ces caract√©ristiques, √©paisse s√©rie s√©dimentaire plus ou moins structur√©e avec l'ensemble inf√©rieur li√© √† une tectonique de socle, importance des accidents tectonique limitant le bassin s√©dimentaire, sont en faveur d'une origine contintentale du plateau de Kerguelen-Heard. The presence of soil layers in the basalt which included charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level as what is termed a microcontinent for three periods between 100 million years ago and 20 million years ago. (The charcoal was made by wildfires started by lightning or lava flows.) Large parts of the now submarine Southern (SKP) and Central Kerguelen Plateaus (CKP) were subaerial during the formation of the LIP. The SKP probably formed an island of with major peaks reaching above sea level. The Kerguelen microcontinent may have been covered by dense conifer forest in the mid-Cretaceous. It finally sank 20 million years ago and is now below sea level.https://news.utexas.edu/1999/05/28/ut-austin-scientist-plays-major-role- in-study-of-underwater-micro-continent/ Biodiversity During the austral summer there is a high density of migratory whales including sperm, minke, and humpback whales along the southern end of the Kerguelen Plateau and the northern part of the adjacent Princess Elizabeth Trough. These whales choose this location for foraging because the Southern Front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is steered off by the Plateau ‚Äî resulting in a poleward extent for the Southern Front only found near the Kerguelen Plateau. This brings shoaled, nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water to the surface which brings macronutrients to the surface. Ice is additionally advected north along the eastern side of the plateau.

Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu, 1985, , p.1-2 was an administrative unit of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1422 (and from 1569, a part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth). Between 1422 and 1441 it was known as the Eldership of Samogitia. The Grand Duke of Lithuania also held the title of Duke of Samogitia, although the actual ruler of the province, responsible to the Duke, was known as the General Elder (Seni≈´nas) of Samogitia. The Duchy was located in the western part of the present Republic of Lithuania. Historically, in the west it had access to the Baltic Sea; in the north, it bordered the Duchy of Courland and Ducal Prussia in the south. During the Middle Ages and until the last partition in 1795, Samogitia had clearly defined borders as the Duchy of Samogitia. Afterwards the area encompassed the Samogitian Diocese. Today Samogitia is one of several ethnographic regions and is not defined administratively. Name Samogitia is a Latinized version of the name ≈Ωemaitija, meaning \\"the Lowlands\\" as opposed to Auk≈°taitija for \\"the Highlands\\". In the Middle Ages, the names Samaiten, Samaitae, Zamaytae, Samogitia, Samattae, Samethi were used in German and Latin sources. They, together with other variants Schmudien, Schamaiten (German) and ≈ªmud≈∫ (Polish), are all derived from the Lithuanian ≈Ωemaiƒçiai, dial. ≈Ωemaitiai / ≈Ωemaitei.  Geography Duchy in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795) The Duchy was located in what today is several counties (apskritis) in Lithuania: a small part of Kaunas County (Kauno Apskritis), the western part ≈†iauliai County (≈†iauli≈≥ Apskritis), Tauragƒó County (Tauragƒós Apskritis), Tel≈°iai County (Tel≈°i≈≥ Apskritis), the northern part of Klaipƒóda County (Klaipƒódos Apskritis) and the northern part of Marijampolƒó County (Marijampolƒós Apskritis). The major part of Samogitia is located on Western Upland. Lowlands which are referred in its name are on the border between Samogitia and Eastern Lithuania, along the Nevƒó≈æis River. The Duchy of Samogitia had the size of approximately 25,700 square kilometers.Grzegorz B≈Çaszczyk, ≈ªmud≈∫ w XVII i XVIII wieku: zaludnienie i struktura spo≈Çeczna, Uniwersytet im. Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu, 1985, , p.19  History  Samogitia in the 17th century The attacking Bear, the historical Coat of Arms of Samogitia Before the formation of the Lithuanian state, Samogitia was ruled by its local noblemen. A chronicle mentions two dukes from Samogitia in 1219 as signatories of the Treaty with Volhynia. Since the formation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century, Samogitia was its dependent territory, however sometimes the influence of the Lithuanian Grand Duke was very limited. During the rule of the first Lithuanian king, Mindaugas, Samogitians pursued an independent foreign policy and continued fighting with the Knights of the Sword even after King Mindaugas had signed a peace treaty with them. Samogitia for 200 years played a crucial role in halting the expansion of the Teutonic Order and defeated the Knights of the Sword in the Battle of Saule (1236) and the Livonian Order in the Battle of Skuodas (1259), and the Battle of Durbe (1260). In the atmosphere of fierce battles with the Teutonic Knights, the Lithuanian rulers Jogaila and Vytautas several times ceded Samogitia to the Teutonic Order in 1382, 1398 and 1404. However, the Teutonic Knights were not successful in subjugating the land, and Samogitians revolted in 1401 and 1409. After the defeats in the Battle of Grunwald (1410) and following wars, in 1422 the Teutonic Order ceded Samogitia to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under the Treaty of Melno. Samogitians were the last in Europe to accept Christianity in 1413. The Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir Jagiellon acknowledged the autonomy of Samogitia in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and then issued a privilege to the Eldership of Samogitia to elects its own elder (starost) in 1441. Because of its prolonged wars with the Teutonic Order, Samogitia had developed a social and political structure different from the rest of Lithuania. It had a larger proportion of free farmers and smaller estates than in Eastern Lithuania. As with most of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Samogitia suffered in the aftermath of the Swedish invasion of Commonwealth (the Deluge, mid-17th century). Its population dropped from close to 400,000 to about 250,000; only to return to 400,000 by the late 18th century.Grzegorz B≈Çaszczyk, ≈ªmud≈∫ w XVII i XVIII wieku: zaludnienie i struktura spo≈Çeczna, Uniwersytet im. Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu, 1985, , p.70 and p.140 After the annexation of Lithuania by Imperial Russia, Samogitia was included in the Vilna Governorate (southern extreme was detached for New East Prussia and so on); in 1843 it was transferred to a newly established Kovno Governorate. At the beginning of the 19th century Samogitia was the center of the Lithuanian national revival, which stressed the importance of the Lithuanian language and opposed russification and polonization attempts.

Kenya has the largest number of Quakers in a single nation ‚Äì about 146,300 in the year 2012 (according to the Friends World Committee for Consultation). South Africa & Central and Southern Africa Yearly Meeting Central and Southern African Yearly Meeting was founded by Friends from London Yearly Meeting. A meeting was first established in Cape Town in 1728. Friends worshipping in South Africa separated from London Yearly Meeting to become an independent Yearly Meeting in 1948. Due to the historic links with London Yearly Meeting, worship is in the unprogrammed tradition, in contrast with Friends' meetings in East Africa. Kenya =History= On April 23, 1902 three Friends -- Arthur Chilson, Edgar Hole, and Willis Hotchkiss -- set sail from New York to Mombasa, Kenya. They went on behalf of the Cleveland Friends Meeting. From there they made their way across by rail to Kisumu and then by foot to Kaimosi and set up a mission there on August 17. They came from the programmed tradition of Five Years Meeting (now Friends United Meeting). From that small beginning, Quakerism grew and spread throughout Kenya during the twentieth century, although it is still concentrated in the western area. A mission hospital (Kaimosi Hospital) was founded in 1941. The Friends Bible Institute opened in 1942. Friends gradually spread into other areas of Kenya, with another hospital (in Lugulu), an epilepsy colony, an agricultural college and a college of technology all being established, as well as many new churches. It also spread to the neighboring countries of Uganda and Tanzania. Due to the size, the original East Africa Yearly Meeting split into several smaller Yearly Meetings, some of these splits have been painful. =Organization= There is now one umbrella organisation - Friends Church in Kenya (FCK) - which brings together all fourteen Yearly Meetings in Kenya. Yearly meetings in Kenya are part of the Friends United Meeting. They include: *Bware Yearly Meeting, based in Suna in southern Nyanza Province *Central Yearly Meeting, based in Lirhanda, just east of Kakamega *Chavakali Yearly Meeting, based in Chavakali, just behind the Boys Secondary School *Chwele Yearly Meeting, based in Chwele, on the southern slopes of Mt Elgon *Chevaywa Yearly Meeting, based in Malava, Matete area *East Africa Yearly Meeting (Kaimosi), based in Tiriki on the Kaimosi mission compound *East Africa Yearly Meeting (North), based in Kitale town *Elgon East Yearly Meeting, based in Kitale town *Elgon Religious Society of Friends, based in Lugulu, just north of Webuye on the Kitale road *Kakamega Yearly Meeting, based in Kakamega at the Amalemba Friends Center *Lugari Yearly Meeting, based in Turbo *Malava Yearly Meeting, based in Malava, just west of the market center *Musingu Yearly Meeting based in Kakamega *Nairobi Yearly Meeting, based at the Friends International Center, Ngong Rd, Nairobi *Tuloi Yearly Meeting, based in Kapsabet *Vihiga Yearly Meeting, based in Vihiga, just west of Majengo *Vokoli Yearly Meeting, based in Wodanga, behind the Moi Girls High School *Soy Yearly Meeting, based in Soy Uganda  The Friends Church spread to Uganda from Kenyan Friends, under the auspices of East Africa Yearly Meeting. By 1945, there were Friends Churches in Sibuse, Nabiswa, Kigumba, Nang‚Äôoma and Kampala. However, the Friends Church was banned by Idi Amin in 1973, until the end of his leadership of Uganda in 1979. After this, an independent Uganda Yearly Meeting was formed, separate from East Africa Yearly Meeting. There is also a second Yearly Meeting in Uganda, Evangelical Friends Church - Uganda. They have applied for affiliation with Evangelical Friends International Tanzania The first Quakers moved to Tanzania from Kenya to look for land, which they found on the border of the Serengeti Game Reserve. Subsequent missionary activity from East Africa Yearly Meeting increased membership, with service projects aimed at agricultural training - popularly known as the ‚ÄúLord‚Äôs acre plan‚Äù. Due to political pressures, many Kenyans left Tanzania in 1978, with Tanzania Yearly Meeting of Friends being founded as a separate organisation in 1980. Kyela Monthly Meeting of Friends (Southern Tanzania) was founded as a worship group when a local man (Barnabas Mwaihojo) read about Quakers on the internet which led to him setting up meetings in three local villages. It is now grown to a bigger meeting with nine meetings in the southern region of Tanzania. We have the following meetings in the south: Kyela Friends Church, Muaya, Mbeya, Tunduma, Sumbawanga, Iringa and many others coming up. Daresalaam Friends church is growing up well and strong in the city of Daresalaam. Mwanza town has three Friends Meetings. Roria Friends churches along the lake region have come up strongly. The yearly Meeting head quarters in based in Mugumu Serengeti region of Tanzania. Burundi  One of the original missionaries from the USA who first planted the Friends Church in Kenya, Arthur Chilson, and his wife Edna, left Kenya to found the Evangelical Friends Church in Burundi in 1934, which was to be run on more evangelical theology, in line with Evangelical Friends International. All foreign missionaries to Burundi were expelled in 1980, and Eglise Evangelique des Amis du Burundi (Evangelical Friends Church Burundi) now exists as an independent Yearly Meeting run by Burundians, affiliated to Evangelical Friends International. Rwanda  Eglise Evangelique des Amis au Rwanda was founded by three missionaries, George Morris, Willard Ferguson and Doris Ferguson, who had been serving in Burundi. Unusually for the Society of Friends, the Friends Church in Rwanda practices water baptism. Democratic Republic of Congo  There are two groups of Friends worshipping in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Communaute des Eglise Evangelique au Congo (Community of Evangelical Church of Congo) are evangelical, programmed Friends affiliated to Evangelical Friends International, formed from missionaries from Burundi in 1981. They still remain a part of Evangelical Friends Church Burundi rather than being a separate Yearly Meeting. A completely separate, and much smaller, unprogrammed meeting exists in Kinshasa, with a membership of about 50. Ghana Since 1925, there has been one unprogrammed Friends' meeting, Hill House Meeting, in the tradition of London Yearly Meeting, attached to Achimota School and college. Nigeria There is a small unprogrammed meeting in Lagos, founded in 1995. Congo There is a small unprogrammed worship group in Brazzaville.

In a March 2006 Wired magazine review of his performance at the October 2005 OVFF, he was described as a \\"50-year-old singer with thick glasses and a salt-and-pepper goatee\\". The article also mentions that the term \\"Frank Hayes Disease\\" is frequently used among filkers to describe the tendency to forget the tune or lyrics of what you are performing while you are in the process of performing it -- even though you wrote the song in question. In his other career, Frank Hayes is a highly regarded expert on computer-based information systems and the myriad aspects of processing and managing technology. His column in Computerworld magazine has focused on these and associated topics for over twenty years. In 2010, he began a column and writing stories for StorefrontBacktalk.com, a site specializing in retail technology coverage. Frank Hayes is married to Firebird Arts and Music founder Teri Lee and lives in Portland, Oregon. On April 4, 2009, Frank was inducted into the Filk Hall of Fame.

His work in the field of social stratification opened up new areas of inquiry for many sociologists in Canada. Porter was born in Vancouver and completed his education at the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom. There, he became interested in studies of social class. On returning to Canada he joined the faculty of Carleton University. He remained at Carleton as a professor, and later, as department chairman, dean and academic vice-president. He was also visiting professor at Harvard and the University of Toronto. Early life At 15 John Porter's father lost his job in Vancouver and his family moved to England in search of stable work. Luck, however, was not found. The depression had devastated both the Canadian and British economies and, after a short while of wrestling with his own poverty induced depression, Porter‚Äôs father abandoned his family. John who had left high school in Vancouver was never able to return as he searched and worked for subsistence. Known for being a gifted student who had a particular proficiency in creative writing, he continued his studies informally with his mother‚Äîa schoolteacher. War broke out and in 1941 Porter joined the Canadian Army as an Intelligence Officer and, towards the end of the war in 1943, he was part of the Allied invasion of Italy and Sicily. After the war he worked with a colonel in London writing a history of Canada's involvement in the war while studying for the entrance exam to the London School of Economics‚Äîwhich he passed on his first attempt. He joined the school at a particularly important ferment: while the university had abandoned its social democratic and Fabian roots, its professors and students were heavily influenced by a liberal reformism which, in the words of one commentator, was \\"a widely shared belief that the irrationality of war and suffering could be eliminated by the judicious application of humane rationality specifically manifested in the form of a generous and intelligent welfare state.\\" Reflecting upon his time as the LSE Porter notes that he was most animated by \\"a concern for ethical principles in social life.\\" In 1949 he graduated and, after a twelve-year hiatus, returned to Canada. He was offered a job teaching political science at the adolescent Carleton College and, two years later, switched to Sociology ‚Äì becoming the school's first appointment in the field. Eventually he was told that to retain his job he would have to get a graduate degree or begin publishing in a meaningful way. As such, in the early 1950s, he began the project that, fifteen years later, would culminate in the production of The Vertical Mosaic. The idea for the project had found its genesis at the LSE where, he had told his PhD supervisor, he wanted to \\"write an interpretation of Canada as a modern democracy.\\" Vertical mosaic The Vertical Mosaic: An Analysis of Social Class and Power in Canada, Porter's most important work, was published in 1965 by University of Toronto Press. It was the study of equality of opportunity and the exercise of power by bureaucratic, economic and political elites in Canada. Porter was concerned with challenging the image that Canada was a classless society with \\"no barriers to opportunity.\\" Porter concludes The Vertical Mosaic with the following observations: Porter argues that Marxist class analysis, based on ownership of the means of production is a \\"questionable criterion of class in modern industrial society\\" (p. 25). Porter rejects power as the basis for social class, with the observation that conflict between those with power and the powerless is nonexistent. Porter constructs a new model based on the study of elites. Elites are those who make decisions in the hierarchical institutional systems of modern society. Porter describes elites in the following way: Legacy Porter's analysis is essentially conflict theorist. While some aspects were inspired by Marxist thinking, he was at pains to present a non-Marxian approach. The nature of the Canadian capitalist class led Porter to develop his model. Notably, it was against his work that scholars in the 1970s began to develop a more contemporary, cultural and Marxist idea of class that defined it not in terms of occupational rank but in terms of power relationships. Indeed, if there is one area of Porter's work which intellectuals are most critical of it is his overly functionalist definition of class and power that closes down other avenues of critical thought: as Pat Armstrong writes, \\"by conceptualizing class in this manner, Porter left out of the theory many of the ways power is used to ensure male dominance in class relations and how those relations shift over time, often through struggle.\\" He noted that this class in the 1950s was a tightly knit group of wealthy, predominantly Anglo-Saxon men, centred in Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario. This group controlled Canada's financial, industrial and political spheres. While there appeared to be one elite, Porter found that there were actually several elite groups, comprising economic, political, labour, and ideological realms. His work thus echoes and expands on United States sociologist C. Wright Mills' study of power elites in the United States. In 1965, the year The Vertical Mosaic was published, sociology, as a discipline, had virtually no academic or mainstream currency: nationwide there were only 115 university based sociologists. There was no national sociology textbook, the closest thing being a volume, compiled by Porter, which featured a loose collection of Canadian Sociology readings. Further, while contemporary Canadian sociology is marked by its breadth of topics and questions ‚Äì class, power, race, education, ability, work, gender ‚Äì and, frankly, a commitment to a left-leaning politic, none of this was true in 1965. The publication of The Vertical Mosaic did, thus, three things: first, it established sociology as a legitimate discipline in the Canadian context; second, it pioneered a macrosociological approach that put class at the centre of its analysis and, third, it constituted an initial offering in the emergent field of inequality studies and diversity studies. Indeed, Rick Helmes-Hayes argues that the book set the tone, parameters of debate and questions for the next fifteen years in sociology. The Vertical Mosaic led to the adoption of the term cultural mosaic by Canadian government agencies such as Statistics Canada, but Porter himself was an opponent of Canada's multiculturalism policy. Porter, along with Peter Pineo, developed the Pineo-Porter index of socioeconomic status. To honour Porter's importance in developing sociology in Canada, the Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association initiated an annual award called the Porter award. Shortly before his death in 1979, he put together ten of his most significant essays in The Measure of Canadian Society: Education, Equality, and Opportunity. He died in Ottawa later that year, due to a heart attack. References *. *.

The film is about a group of underground motorcycle drag racers and the intense rivalry between a legendary motorcyclist and a young racing prodigy who has formed his own biker gang. The film features an ensemble cast including Laurence Fishburne, Derek Luke, Meagan Good, Djimon Hounsou, Brendan Fehr, Rick Gonzalez, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard, Orlando Jones, Salli Richardson, and Kid Rock. It also features Lisa Bonet, and Vanessa Bell Calloway. Biker Boyz was released on January 31, 2003 in the United States by DreamWorks Pictures. Plot In the world of underground motorcycle drag racing, the undefeated racer known as Smoke (Laurence Fishburne) is the undisputed \\"King of Cali\\". But Smoke's dominance of the set is about to be threatened by a young motorcycle racing prodigy called Kid (Derek Luke), who is determined to win Smoke's \\"crown\\" and earn the coveted title. Kid says that the difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn - and that his father, Slick Will (Eriq La Salle), taught him plenty. Kid, a novice rider and motorcycle club \\"prospect,\\" has been assisting his father, Slick Will, as they prepare Smoke's bike for an evening of drag races. One biker issues a challenge to Smoke, who accepts, and the race begins. In the midst of the race, the other biker suffers a hydraulics malfunction and spins out of control, sending his bike flying from under him into a row of parked bikes, one of which heads right into Slick Will, throwing him through a store window and killing him instantly. At Slick Will's funeral, dozens of bikers from the \\"Black Knights\\", to whom the late Will was the mechanic, show up with Smoke, who drops a single rose and a signed Black Knights flag into his grave. Six months later, Kid is now a familiar racer with his own custom-powered bike. His first \\"race\\" being when he interferes in a dangerous challenge with Donny (Tyson Beckford). As Kid interrupts the race, he pulls off several stunts, notably standing on top of the motorcycle while it is still moving. He wins the race and the crowd seem to like his stunts, much to the dissatisfaction of Smoke. Kid demands to race with Smoke but the latter says he is too inexperienced and that Kid should get experience first. Kid goes to a diner where he meets Stuntman (Brendan Fehr), and it is revealed that the two were hustling in the previous race. Fellow biker Primo (Rick Gonzalez) tells them to create a bike club; after a bit of persuasion they agree, and Kid goes to the biker jury consisting of 8 leaders of the most powerful biker gangs, where Smoke is the chairman. He apologizes for his disrespect towards Smoke and they all agree to verify the club, calling themselves \\"Biker Boyz\\". Kid is set to race Motherland (Djimon Hounsou) to prove himself to Smoke. However, he has showed up late to \\"make an entrance\\" after Smoke has already beaten his long-time rival Dogg (Kid Rock), who is continually after Smoke's helmet. Kid is arrested when racing Motherland and the rest of the bikers manage to escape. Kid's mother Anita (Vanessa Bell Calloway) confronts him, threatening to evict Kid from her house if he races again. One night at a Black Knights dance, Kid is challenged to race Dogg and accepts in a fit of rage. Having overheard, Anita finds Smoke before the race and demands that he stop it. Angry, Smoke confronts Anita and demands a reason where she tells him that Kid is actually his son, not Slick Will's. Smoke successfully stops the race by punching out Kid and stealing his keys, but this only leads to a fight between the two, from which Kid comes off considerably worse than Smoke. Smoke then tells him that he is his son, to which Kid angrily goes home and confronts Anita, who confesses that it's the truth. Enraged, Kid leaves and moves in with his girlfriend Tina (Meagan Good). Kid soon decides to turn renegade and, after gaining quite a few more followers for his club, announces that \\"we're gonna win more lids than any crew on the set and we're gonna out hustle every crew off the set\\" and indicates that from that point on, \\"Biker Boyz set their own rules.\\" The Biker Boyz get their own hangout and begin hustling several races, but when Stuntman successfully hustles the nephew of a dangerous biker, he and Primo (Rick Gonzalez) are ambushed at a party. Kid comes to the rescue but is quickly overpowered as the leader of the other club pulls a gun on him; Smoke and some of the other Black Knights intervene and convince the other bikers to stand down. Smoke takes Kid inside and sits down to give him a stern talking-to, but Kid shrugs it off angrily. Aggravated, Smoke finally agrees to race Kid, under the condition that whoever loses will never race again; but first Kid has to race Dogg - this time, at the track. On the race track, everybody shows up, including the Black Knights. At the race, Dogg and Kid race down, and Kid is going to win, but Dogg plays dirty and causes him to crash; although Kid survives, his bike is wrecked. Later that day, Smoke talks to Kid, and informs him that the authorities are going to close the track, due to many crashes, but he managed to rent a local farm outside of town to race on it. Kid agrees to arrive the next day. Later that night, Kid, Primo, and Stuntman are trying unsuccessfully to fix Kid's bike until Dogg's crew arrives to confront them, but Dogg's mechanic admits that the damage is too severe to be fixed in time for the race. Dogg informs Kid; \\"There are only 2 bikes as strong and fast as Smoke's: yours, and mine.\\" As a peace offering, Dogg offers to lend Kid his bike, but only if Kid promises him that he will beat Smoke tomorrow. On the day of the race, both the crew of the Black Knights and the Biker Boyz arrive. Smoke wants it to be a fair race, with no nitrous oxide system, and Kid wants Tina to start the race. Smoke and Kid are racing on a farm with open fields. With the finish line in sight, it is obvious that Smoke will win - however, filled with emotions, he decides to slow down and let his son win the race, becoming the new \\"King of Cali\\". Kid tells Smoke to hang onto his crown for a while, and that he'll come and get it someday. He then rides off, repeating his sentiment that the difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn, and that his father taught him plenty.

Development  Biker Boyz is based loosely on Manuel \\"Pokey\\" Galloway the president of Valiant Riders of Pasadena, Ca. Laurence Fishburne, Derek Luke, Orlando Jones, Djimon Hounsou and Nicholas Sheriff, Lisa Bonet, Brendan Fehr, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard, Kid Rock, Rick Gonzalez, Meagan Good are all avid bikers in real life.These facts can be verified with the DVD's bonus features. The real \\"King Of Cali\\" made a cameo appearance in the film, in the scene where Kid is in a meeting with the set. Slick Will really doesn't blink as the bike hits him, as Soul Train states. Actual motorcycle clubs were on the set as technical advisors, and performed some of the tricks, stunts, and racing. They include Valiant Riders, The Mighty Black Sabbath Motorcycle Club Nation, G-Zer Tribe, Ruff Ryders, Soul Brothers, Total Package, Chosen Few MC, Rare Breed, Brothers of the Sun, Sisters of the Sun, Deuces, and Black Sabbath New Breed. The Biker Boyz jackets were in part inspired by Nexxunlimited Entertainment (as shown in the end credits). Soundtrack A soundtrack containing hip hop, rock and R&B; music was released on January 23, 2003 by DreamWorks Records. It peaked at #98 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums.

The \\"Port of San Juan\\" is the general name used to call various passenger and cargo facilities located in lands around the San Juan Bay (Bah√≠a de San Juan). The port is composed of a total of sixteen piers, of which eight are used for passenger ships and eight for cargo ships. The port's facilities, in addition to, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport and the Cata√±o Ferry \\"Lancha de Cata√±o\\" services, are property of the Puerto Rico Ports Authority. The bay and its docks are located along San Antonio Canal, a narrow navigable section of San Juan Bay lying south of Old San Juan and San Juan island, and north and west of the Puerto Rico Convention Center District and Isla Grande Airport. The municipalities of Cata√±o, Guaynabo and San Juan compose the south side of the bay and port. Cargo facilities A cargo ship unloading in Puerto Nuevo. The Port of San Juan's cargo facilities are located on the southern portion of San Juan Bay. Of the approximately eight cargo terminals, five are located in the Puerto Nuevo district of San Juan and the other three are located in the neighboring municipality of Guaynabo. The cargo facilities allow for more than 500,000 square feet (46,000 m¬≤) of space for loading and unloading cargo. The location of the port's cargo facilities give it immediate access to Puerto Rico's vast expressway system and several major local routes, this allows for the fast and efficient transportation of goods throughout the Metropolitan Area and the rest of the island. Passenger facilities The Port of San Juan's passenger facilities are located along San Antonio Canal. Of the 15 piers in the channel, four accommodate cruise ships while others serve cargo vessels and the Cata√±o Ferry. =Ferry service= The Cata√±o Ferry (Lancha de Cata√±o) provides multiple daily round-trips from San Juan to Cata√±o. During the late 1980s, ferry service covered the San Juan area and the trip lasted approximately one hour. The service departed and arrived at the Old San Juan docks, but its popularity was short lived and thus this service was stopped during the early 1990s. = Cruise service = Club Med 2 in the Port of San Juan While most cargo ships dock on the south side of the bay, cruise ships arrive at one of the four cruise piers located along San Antonio Canal. This arrangement allows tourists to walk to major attractions such as Old San Juan and the Puerto Rico Convention Center District. The short distance between the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport and the cruise ship docks is 7 miles and makes the area a prime location for cruise companies. Cruise ship companies, such as Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean prefer this setting, and have made the San Juan one of their ports of call. Some of the most recognized ships to have docked at the Port of San Juan during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were the Carla C, and Cunard's Countess and Princess ships.  Ships based out of San Juan  The following cruise ships are homeported at San Juan: *Carnival Fascination *Freedom of the Seas *Celebrity Summit (seasonal) *Jewel of the Seas (seasonal) *Norwegian Dawn (seasonal) *Norwegian Epic (seasonal) *Silver Wind (seasonal) depart from San Juan to Fort Lauderdale *Vision of the Seas (seasonal) *Sea Dream II (seasonal)  Future ships based out of San Juan  *Disney Magic *Star Pride *Viking Sea  Operators that visit San Juan  The following operators visit San Juan: *AIDA Cruises *Azamara Club Cruises *Carnival *Celebrity *Costa Crociere *Crystal Cruises *Disney Cruise Line *Holland America Line *MSC Cruises *Norwegian Cruise Line *Oceania Cruises *Princess Cruises *Regent Seven Seas Cruises *Royal Caribbean *SeaDream Yacht Club *Silversea *Viking Ocean Cruises *Windstar Cruises Destinations The following is a listing of the majority of the locations served by passenger ship and ferry routes. *Aruba *Antigua *Bahamas *Barbados *Bermuda *Bonaire *British Virgin Islands *Cura√ßao *Dominican Republic *Dominica *Grenada *Florida *Jamaica *Mexico *St. Kitts and Nevis *St. Lucia *St. Maarten *Trinidad and Tobago *Turks and Caicos *US Virgin Islands *Venezuela  Operations during Hurricane Maria  After Hurricane Maria devastated the communications and electricity network in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, the Port could not get enough truck drivers to distribute containers of relief supplies.

Thor was the Asgardian God of Thunder based on the deity of the same name of Norse mythology and a founding member of the Ultimates. Thor was adapted from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic book version of Thor by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch, first appearing in The Ultimates. \\"Ultimate Thor\\" is the alter-ego of Thorlief Golmen, an anarchist who discovered he is the reincarnated form of the Norse warrior Thor. The \\"Ultimate\\" redesign of the character reduces the number of Thor's powers, and reduces the character's reliance upon his hammer, Mjolnir, as a source of power. Perhaps most significantly, the Thunder God's long- established personality is drastically altered, changing him from an eager and willing divine combatant into an ecocentric, arguably unstable, and somewhat reluctant warrior. Fictional character biography =Origin= Ultimate Thor was once a psychiatric nurse called Thorlief Golmen until suffering a nervous breakdown before his 30th birthday. During the 18 months he spent institutionalized, he claims to have realized who he is and why he has been sent to Earth. He claimed to be Thor, Norse god of thunder, on a mission to save the planet and to stop the \\"war to end all wars\\". Thor himself claims to have known who he was since he was twelve years old, and that his nervous breakdown only brought him further clarity. His political and social activism, as well as his own self-help books, attracted rebellious hippies and conspiracy theorists. He spoke against America's military aggression towards other world powers and the military-industrial complex.The Ultimates #4The Ultimates vol.2, #4-6 His background is made less clear due to his brother Loki's reality manipulations,The Ultimates vol.2 #4-13 and later stories try to reconcile this history with the existence of Asgard.Ultimate Comics: Thor #1-6 =Ultimates= In The Ultimates, when General Nick Fury contacted Thor about joining the Ultimates, Thor refused to work for the military-industrial complex that he detests. When the Hulk appeared in Manhattan, Thor refused to assist unless the President doubled the foreign aid budget. Not long after the Ultimates confronted the Hulk, the President relented and Thor appeared in time to save Captain America from Banner. Following the battle, Thor became good friends with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, pledging his support whenever lives are in danger. Over dinner, he explains to Stark and Rogers his origins and insists that he is the genuine article. Soon thereafter, Thor was briefed on the Chitauri and sent to investigate a suspected Chitauri base in Micronesia. They were saved by Iron Man's force field after they discovered the base abandoned and ready to explode. Once a Chitauri fleet appeared in Arizona, Thor brought the survivors there. He and Iron Man then provided air support against the Chitauri spacecraft until the Air Force arrived. After Iron Man asked Thor to help him dispose of the Chitauri bomb that would obliterate the entire solar system, Thor teleported it to the wastes of N√°str√∂nd, a deserted world in the Asgardian cosmos where its detonation caused only a small ripple in our space-time.The Ultimates #1-13 =Ultimate War= In Ultimate War, Thor appears as a member of the Ultimates, retrieving the dead with Iron Man after the attack in issue one. When Magneto attacks the Ultimates, he says he is surprised to see Thor with the Ultimates, and asks him if he thinks he can change them. Thor throws Mjolnir at the Master of Magnetism, but Magneto manages to stop it an inch from his helmet and throws it back at Thor, sending him through a wall. Thor joins the Ultimates in attacking the X-Men later on; he fought Storm but is defeated by Colossus. =Ultimate Six= In Ultimate Six, Thor appears with the Ultimates while bringing in Kraven the Hunter, although he refuses Captain America's requests to catch Kraven or bring him back. He is seen aiding in reconstruction efforts in Bosnia when summoned following the Six's breakout. Thor is the one who defeats Electro during the climactic battle at the White House.Ultimate Six #1-7 =Ultimate Secret= In Ultimate Secret, Thor and Iron Man escort the Fantastic Four to Nevada. When the Kree attack the base, Thor, Black Widow, Johnny Storm, and The Thing fight off the aliens. As he is idolized by Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, he fraternizes with them to the point of ordering Carol Danvers to prepare a keg of beer for after the battle.Ultimate Secret #1-4 =Ultimate Fantastic Four= Thor has appeared or been mentioned in several storylines of the Ultimate Fantastic Four. Reed Richards at one point created infant hard light versions of the Ultimates and thought Thor to be the most powerful superhuman on the planet. This was proved wrong when Namor appeared to be physically stronger. In another storyline an interdimensional parasite that sought out the most powerful being on the planet bypassed a present Thor and possessed Doctor Doom. This is attributed to a combination of Doom's physical states and knowledge of Atlantean magic. Thor appeared as a minor character in an alternate timeline as the President of the United States due to time travel involving Skrull invaders. In it his powers were described as ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù This alternate version was killed during the Skrull invasion and ceased to exist when the timeline was erased. Thor appeared in a later storyline involving Thanos. He stated he had fought Thanos in the past and tried to fight him again along with the rest of the Ultimates. He was quickly defeated due to Thanos possessing the Cosmic Cube and turned into a tree. This was undone when Thanos was defeated by the Fantastic Four. =Ultimates 2= In Ultimates 2 Thor has resigned from the Ultimates due to his belief that the team has become a tool for American foreign policy. In a restaurant, he meets fellow Asgardian Volstagg, also reincarnated as a human being, who warns him his half-brother Gunnar Golmen/Loki has escaped and is shifting reality on Earth to strike at Thor. Volstagg is then erased from reality making it look like Thor is delusional. After Bruce Banner's identity of the Hulk is leaked to the public, Captain America accuses Thor of the act, but Thor denies the charge and tries to warn Captain America of Loki's influence, but his warnings are rejected as are his claims to be Thor. An anti-super-soldier demonstration in Italy turns violent due to Loki's interference. When Thor intervenes on behalf of the protesters, the incident is used as an excuse for the Ultimates to team with the European Defence Initiative's super-soldiers to arrest him. The EDI's head scientist, Gunnar Golmen, reveals that Thor's powers are technological in nature, coming from his belt and hammer. Gunnar explains that Thor is really his own mentally troubled brother who stole the equipment and has been being acting as Thor, God of Thunder, ever since. Gunnar claims the equipment gives Thor physical strength and powers beyond anyone else on the planet, and that he is too dangerous to take on alone. Thor is tracked to Norway. After he fails to convince the Ultimates that Gunnar is really a masquerading Loki manipulating reality, a battle ensues. Despite initially holding his own, Thor is eventually overwhelmed and has to call upon a storm. At the last moment, Quicksilver is able to remove his belt stripping Thor of his powers and his ability to use Mjolnir. Thor is then locked up in the Triskelion all the time being mocked by Loki, who is invisible to all but him and attempts to convince him that he is insane. Thor is imprisoned in the Triskelion until the last issue of the series, where his attempts to warn the Ultimates about the coming dangers are ignored. Following the Liberators' conquest of America, Thor is freed by Odin (this is helped by Scarlet Witch using her mutant hex power to effect the probability of Thor regaining his power) and restored to full power in time to battle a revealed Loki. At first Loki has the upper hand by using his powers over reality to become immune to Thor's hammer and overpowering the thunder god while summoning an army of Asgardian monsters to kill the Ultimates. After an army of Asgardian warriors arrive to fight the monsters, Loki's powers stop working for unknown reasons. During the battle Loki reveals he is responsible for creating the idea of a Norwegian super-soldier program and framing Captain America. Thor is able to destroy Loki's mortal form and send his spirit back to Odin for punishment. Now vindicated in his claims of godhood, Thor learns that the Ultimates will no longer be working for the government, and rejoins the team.Ultimates 2 #1-13 =Ultimate Power= In Ultimate Power, Thor appears alongside the rest of the new Ultimates alongside Nick Fury arriving to battle the Squadron Supreme when they destroy the roof of the Baxter Building. After the battle Thor used his hammer to teleport the Helicarrier with the team to the Supremeverse. There he engages Hyperion in combat, but is defeated by the former's superior speed.Ultimate Power #1-9 In Ultimate Power #7 Thor gains the upper hand against Hyperion, felling him with a huge bolt of lightning then severely beating him with Mjolnir. He also knocks back Zarda as she attempts to stop him from beating Hyperion.Ultimate Power #7 =Ultimates 3= In Ultimates 3 Thor undergoes many changes making him closer to his mainstream counterpart. He is redesigned with a beard and a bulkier build. He becomes much more eager for battle and more vengeful. His ax/hammer is replaced with one closer to the mainstream version of Mjolnir in look. He has formed a romantic relationship with Valkyrie, who has mysteriously gained superhuman powers. He starts speaking in a Shakespearean pattern, claiming it is the way he truly speaks and with his godhood no longer in doubt feels he no longer has to hide it. During the course of the story he reveals he has a collection of weapons which were a gift from Odin forged by Ulik the troll. The ax/hammer weapon is among them. During the course of the story Thor aids the team when the Brotherhood of Mutants attacks their mansion. He later travels to the Savage Land with the Ultimates to confront Magneto. He once again battles Magneto, but is quickly defeated and buried near the center of the Earth. After the true mastermind behind the events is revealed, Thor attempts to confront Magneto again, but Magneto uses his powers to take Thor's hammer from him and then leaves. Following this, Thor begins using a sword. Donald Blake also appeared in the first issue of the series as the doctor who attempted to revive the Scarlet Witch after she was shot. Blake was never seen again in the series; however he later would appear in Ultimate Thor where he is revealed to be Balder, Thor and Loki's brother and Odin's eyes and ears, revived in human form after being murdered by Loki.Ultimates 3 #1-5 =Ultimatum= As mentioned, Magneto uses Thor's hammer to create worldwide destruction. During these events Thor, upon finding Valkyrie's lifeless body, enters Valhalla to reclaim her soul. He is then confronted by Hela, who forces Thor to battle Hela's army of fallen warriors to reach Valkyrie. Captain America suddenly appears in Valhalla, implying that he has died. In Valhalla, Thor sacrifices himself to save Valkyrie and Captain America from Hela and this allows them to go back to live.Ultimatum #1-5 =New Ultimates= In New Ultimates #1 he is shown still imprisoned, demanding Hela returns him to Earth and to Valkyrie. She tells him she will give him whatever his heart desires in exchange for a son. The next issue has a vision shown to Valkyrie by Amora where he is making love with Hela as he had no other choice. Later Hela tells him that another soul is still needed for him to leave, Thor says it will be hers but finds himself unable to kill her because she is already pregnant. At the end of the issue he is resurrected at the price of the death of Valkyrie. Thor then goes into a rage searching for his brother and attacking the Ultimates in the process until he finally finds him and gets his hammer back with the Ultimates watching as he is still extremely angry.New Ultimates #1-5 =Ultimate Comics: Avengers vs. New Ultimates= Thor remained in the Ultimates when they were employed by Carol Danvers and battled Nick Fury's black-ops team codenamed the Avengers. At this point, Thor was back in a relationship with Jane Foster and shared an apartment with her and began to talk like a \\"normal person\\" again when Tony Stark promised to donate money to charity if Thor gave up his Asgardian \\"faux-Shakespearean\\" speech-pattern. In the final battle during the revolution in North Korea organised by Gregory Stark, Thor and the Ultimates battled Gregory, whose superpowered suit made him too powerful to defeat until Iron Man disabled it with an electromagnetic pulse, giving Thor the opportunity to kill Gregory on the spot with a lightning bolt.Avengers vs. New Ultimates #1-6 =Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man= Thor's return and rejoining into the Ultimates was confirmed in the pages of Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, where he is seen as one of the Ultimates. Director Danvers asks his advice, and one of the Ultimates who will teach Spider-Man to be a hero. He is later shown attending Peter Parker's funeral, where he reflects that he has also seen Peter dining in Valhalla with the deceased X-Men and Ultimates members. =Ultimate Comics: Thor= Ultimate Comics: Thor reveals Thor's personal history from Asgard and prior to the events of The Ultimates. Eons ago, Thor resided in Asgard along with his brothers Balder and Loki, and under the rule of King Odin. Odin foresees that Asgard will soon fall and chooses Thor to champion the ways of Asgard after that event. The hammer Mjolnir is crafted to contain the power of Asgard, and Thor is the only one who is able to wield the weapon. After murdering Balder and stealing the sacred Norn Stones, Loki relocates to Earth. There, he aligns himself with the Nazis in World War 2 in the guise of Baron Zemo. Loki uses the stones to return to Asgard, armed with an army of Frost Giants and Nazi soldiers. In the ensuing battle, Odin transports Loki to the Room with No Doors, but is subsequently killed by a Frost Giant named Mammoth. While Asgard dematerializes, Thor delivers one last powerful blow against the invaders. In modern-day Earth, Thor is shown to be the subject of the European Super Soldier program. His powers are shown to be a function of the program, designed by the E.S.S. to imitate Norse iconography with Thor as the super-soldier symbol of Norway, but the project meets an unexpected stumbling block when Thor's claims of being the human incarnation of a Norse God leads the scientists in charge of the program to believe that he is insane. Psychiatrist Dr. Donald Blake is later revealed to be the reborn Balder and tells the scientists that his examination suggests that Thor is who he says he is. Balder tells Thor that, despite Ragnarok destroying Asgard, the Gods live on in the hearts of mortals and are yet to be reawakened. This, in addition to the financial costs that went into the super soldier program, convinces the scientists to complete the work that turns Thor into a super soldier. He is given a suit designed to heighten his strength significantly, leaving him practically unbeatable, along with being equipped with a weather- manipulation device which allows him to control weather and teleport across space. When the scientist face difficulty in handling the size of the machine, Thor tells them to make it the head of his new ax-hammer. Once allowed into the open, Thor works on a number of humanitarian projects, and rejects offers from General Nick Fury to join the Ultimates. Meanwhile, Loki escapes from the Room with No Doors and returns to Earth. Balder convinces Thor to take up his responsibility as a hero as Thor joins the Ultimates in subduing the Hulk. Despite his pacifist ideals, Thor promises to \\"bring the Thunder\\" against \\"men who make war\\".Ultimate Comics: Thor #1-5 =Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates= Reed Richards returned to Earth and founded an organization called Children of Tomorrow, a group of evolved humans with the aim of dominating the world, building their base called the Dome. The Dome's interior ages at an accelerated rate compared to the outside world. Over 900 years have passed inside the Dome, so their inhabitants evolved themselves to perfect super- humans. The EUSS attacked the Dome with Captain Britain, Captain Spain and Captain France along with Thor. The heroes were subdued by the enemies and some of them were killed, draining their powers. After examining Thor, Richards, now called the Maker, sent the Children for the source of power of Thor, leading them to Asgard. After killing every Asgardian God, the Children drained the power of Yggdrasil, leaving Thor powerless. After Iron Man rescued Thor, he provided Odinson with an upgraded version of his Super-Soldier armor, with which Thor teleported to the Dome in search of vengeance. There, he rescued Captain Britain, but was defeated by the Children, and the Maker showed himself as Reed Richards, with the condition of deliver that message. Also, a new ability emerged to Thor, being the last Asgardian alive, he apparently \\"became\\" Valhalla, being able to see the ghost of the dead Asgardians, such as Odin, Loki, and others, who apparently also acts as his awareness, helping him. Following these events, Thor moved into Stark Tower with Jane Foster.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #1-6 Thor was present with Stark when the Ultimates were labelled as outlaws accompanied him when Stark detailed his plans of how to defeat Reed Richards to the new President of the United States. He easily defeated the Hulk, who was brainwashed by the Maker and injected with a Giant-Man serum. Thor later battles his son, Modi, who has tried to conquer the United States with the help of Hydra. Thor is forced to kill Modi, and is left to mourn his son, as well as rue his own failures as a father.Ultimate Comics Ultimates #13-18 When Reed Richards and his Dark Ultimates destroy the Triskellion, Thor leaves to drown his sorrows at a small bar in Arizona. Bruce Banner tracks Thor down and transforms into the Hulk, leading to a rematch between the two. Thor is defeated and imprisoned, but is later freed alongside the rest of his teammates. Iron Man also creates a new hammer and suit of armor for Thor by using Reed's future technology.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #25-30 When the Earth-616 version of Galactus attacks the Ultimate Earth, Thor is among those to challenge the entity. During the final battle, Thor sacrifices himself in order to drive Galactus into the Negative Zone, trapping them both.Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand #1-5 =Secret Wars= After the destruction of both the Earth-616 and Ultimate universes, Thor is among those rescued by God Doom and transported to Battleworld. Now known as Thunderer Thorlief (nicknamed \\"Ultimate Thor\\"), he begins investigating the murderers of various men and women who all turn out to be alternate universe versions of Donald Blake and Jane Foster. Ultimate Thor discovers that the murders were committed by Rune Thor, who had been tasked by God Doom with eliminating the various versions of Donald and Jane in order to keep the Thor Corps from remembering that the Multiverse once existed before Battleworld. Ultimate Thor and the other members of the Thor Corps storm Doom's castle, where they are all killed. After his death, Ultimate Thor's hammer is shown to have landed on the Earth-616 version of Asgard.Thors #1-4 =The Unworthy Thor= Sometime later, the hammer is shown to be on a mysterious space ship, in front of an imprisoned Thor Odinson.The Mighty Thor Vol. 5 #5 This is later revealed to be the ship of the Collector who wants to possess the hammer for himself, and has obtained the ruins of Asgard to this end. Currently, the Collector is being challenged for possession of this hammer by Thanos' Black Order, as well as a team-up of Odinson, Toothgnasher (one of his magical goats), \\"Thori\\" (a Hellhound previously owned by Loki), and Beta Ray Bill. Although able to channel its power when in proximity, Odinson chooses not to claim the hammer, but he and Bill use the power of the hammer to return Asgard to its rightful place while decimating the Collector's forces.The Unworthy Thor #2-5 (2016-2017) =Mighty Thor (2015 series)= This hammer is subsequently claimed by Volstagg, after he witnesses the brutal demise of several children in a conflict with Cindr's forces. This transforms Volstagg into the War Thor.The Mighty Thor #20 (2017) Later, the hammer gets destroyed in a battle with the Mangog. The Mighty Thor #701 (2017) =Avengers A.I.= This hammer is also seen in one alternate future wielded by synthezoid Victor Mancha.Avengers A.I. #10 Powers and abilities Thor possesses immense superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. At the beginning of the series, his physical powers were entirely dependent on his belt because he had no access to his divine powers. After being restored by Odin, however, it is unclear if the belt boosts his powers or, in fact, serves any purpose at all. Thor possesses the ability to control the weather on a large scale. He is capable of summoning thunderstorms and controlling massive amounts of lightning. He can teleport across space and between dimensions. It is unknown to what extent he relies on his weapons for these abilities. It is also unknown if Thor can control other types of weather. Both variations of his hammer are capable of these powers. Thor possesses some skill at combat. He is depicted with an armory of weapons ranging from different types of hammers to swords and daggers. However, the ax/hammer hybrid primarily wielded by the character is considered to be the \\"Ultimate\\" version of Mjolnir, as revealed in Ultimate Power #9. But, in the Ultimate Thor miniseries it is revealed that the hammer resembling the Earth-616 version was his weapon when he was a god, and was lost during Ragnarok. When he is reincarnated as Thorleif Golmen, he is given tech-based armour and a portable power supply that gives him his superhuman powers, which is turned into the recognisable axe-hammer from The Ultimates. Starting in The Ultimates 3, Thor no longer wears the belt or uses the axe-hammer, and instead uses the \\"true\\" Mjolnir. When the Children of Tomorrow drain the Odinforce and exterminate the Asgardian race, Thor is stripped of his godly powers and gives his square hammer to his son Modi before pushing him into the World Tree. From then, he uses the belt and axe- hammer he wielded before, now more powerful due to advancements made by Tony Stark. Even after Thor's 'death' after the Incursions, his hammer survived the destruction of the multiverse and landed on Asgard. When the currently- unworthy Odinson of Earth-616 came in close proximity of it, he experienced brief flashes of Ultimate Thor's life, even sensing that the hammer was in some way searching for its true master, and was able to channel the hammer's control of the lightning despite not being its master or worthy of his own hammer at this point. In other media *Ultimate Thor appears in the two animated films Ultimate Avengers: The Movie and Ultimate Avengers 2 (which are loosely adapted from The Ultimates), voiced by Dave Boat. Thor undergoes some differences to make him resemble the original Thor created by Stan Lee. His costume and hammer remain unchanged from The Ultimates, though he is clean- shaven and has on-screen conferences with Odin. His speech is formal and stilted. Mj√∂llnir is shown to have the worthiness test similar to the classic Thor, but the Hulk is shown to be able to lift the hammer with great physical effort. In Ultimate Avengers, Thor's onscreen time is considerably smaller than the appearances of the other heroes. He first appears with a group of environmental protesters when Nick Fury and Captain America approach him to join the Avengers, which he harshly refuses. He appears in the climax of the film in time to help defeat the Chitauri fleet and the Hulk. In Ultimate Avengers 2, he overcomes a predicament (which he foresees in a vision) involving the deaths of the Avengers at the hands of the Chitauri invasion force. He disobeys Odin's demand that he returns to Asgard and stops interfering with the affairs of man. He aids the team in fighting the worldwide invasion and confirms his claims to be the God of Thunder by reviving Iron Man, who is near death at this point. He appears at the memorial for the deceased Giant Man. *The Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Thor borrows certain elements of costume and personality from the Ultimate version.

Additionally, Trimpe penciled the covers of five Hulk annuals (1969, 1971‚Äì72, 1976‚Äì77, titled King-Size Special! The Incredible Hulk except for #4, The Incredible Hulk Special), and both penciled and inked the 39-page feature story of The Incredible Hulk Annual #12 (Aug. 1983). Under the Marvel Method of writer-artist collaboration, Trimpe, like other Marvel artists of the time, was uncredited co-plotter of most of his stories, a working arrangement Trimpe said he enjoyed. Among the characters co-created by Trimpe during his run on the title were Jim Wilson in issue #131 (Sept. 1970)Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 146: \\"This issue [#131] saw the introduction of Jim Wilson, a character created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Herb Trimpe\\" and Doc Samson in #141 (July 1971).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 150: \\"Created by Roy Thomas and artist Herb Trimpe, Dr. Leonard Samson was a psychiatrist...[who] irradiated himself with gamma rays and transformed into a super-strong being.\\" During his time on the comic, he became the first artist to draw for publication the character Wolverine, who would go on to become one of Marvel's most popular. The character was conceived by Roy Thomas, written by Len Wein and designed by Marvel de facto art director John Romita Sr. as an antagonist for the Hulk, introduced in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #180 (Oct. 1974) and making his first full appearance the following issue.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 167: \\"Len Wein wrote and Herb Trimpe drew Wolverine's cameo appearance in The Incredible Hulk #180 and his premiere in issue #181.\\" Trimpe in 2009 said he \\"distinctly remembers\\" Romita's sketch, and that, \\"The way I see it, [Romita and writer Len Wein] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life! ... It was just one of those secondary or tertiary characters, actually, that we were using in that particular book with no particular notion of it going anywhere. We did characters in The [Incredible] Hulk all the time that were in [particular] issues and that was the end of them.\\" Trimpe co- created nearly all of the characters introduced during his run on The Incredible Hulk, with Wolverine being a rare exception. He said that he devised the military unit the Hulkbusters, which became a regular element of The Incredible Hulk: Trimpe also had a year's run on The Defenders (#68‚Äì81, February 1979 ‚Äì March 1980), a superhero-team comic featuring the Hulk. He also drew the cover, featuring the Hulk, of the 1971 issue of Rolling Stone containing a major profile of Marvel Comics.Green, Robin. \\"Face Front! Clap Your Hands, You're on the Winning Team!\\", Rolling Stone #91, September 16, 1971, via \\"Green Skin's Grab-Bag\\" (fan site) () The artist in 2002 recalled a less-than-smooth start to his Hulk tenure: \\"I did, like, three or four pages, and Stan [Lee] saw them and made Frank Giacoia do the layouts [for Trimpe's fourth issue, #109, Nov. 1968]. It wasn't my storytelling, there was a good flow there, but it was too [much like] EC [Comics] for Stan. I loved EC, the dark atmosphere and clean lines of it. . . . But it wasn't right for Marvel.\\" =Other Marvel work= Trimpe sketching at the Big Apple Comic Con, October 2, 2010 As a Marvel mainstay, Trimpe would draw nearly every starring character, including Captain America (Captain America #184 and 291), the Fantastic Four (Fantastic Four Annual #25‚Äì26 in 1992‚Äì1993; Fantastic Four Unlimited #1‚Äì12 in 1993‚Äì1995), Iron Man (Iron Man #39, 82‚Äì85, and 93‚Äì94 in the 1970s, plus occasional others), Ka-Zar (Astonishing Tales #7‚Äì8, 1971), Nick Fury (Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #13‚Äì15, 1969), Thor (Thor Annual #15‚Äì16, 1990‚Äì1991), Ant-Man (Marvel Feature #4‚Äì6), Killraven (Amazing Adventures #20‚Äì24, #33), Rawhide Kid, Spider-Man, and many more as the regular artist of Marvel Team-Up #106‚Äì118 (1981‚Äì1982) and Marvel Team-Up Annual #3‚Äì4 (1980‚Äì1981). As the artist of Super-Villain Team-Up, Trimpe co-created the Shroud with writer Steve Englehart.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: \\"Writer Steve Englehart and artist Herb Trimpe created the Shroud, a blind vigilante with mystical abilities, in Super-Villain Team-Up #5.\\" Captain Britain was introduced by Chris Claremont and Trimpe in an ongoing series published by Marvel UK.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 176: \\"Writer Chris Claremont and artist Herb Trimpe created a new super-hero specifically for Marvel's readers in the United Kingdom.\\" In 1976, Trimpe was one of the inkers of Captain America's Bicentennial Battles, an oversized treasury-format one-shot written and penciled by Jack Kirby. Trimpe drew Marvel Treasury Edition #25 (1980) \\"Spider-Man vs. the Hulk at the Winter Olympics\\" which featured a story set at the 1980 Winter Olympics by writers Mark Gruenwald, Steven Grant, and Bill Mantlo. Jack Kirby's Machine Man character was revived in a 1984 limited series drawn by Trimpe.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 219: \\"Machine Man was a living robot who was relaunched in 1984 by Tom DeFalco, Herb Trimpe, and Barry Windsor-Smith.\\" In the late 1970s and 1980s, Trimpe's Marvel work included licensed movie and TV franchises. He drew all but issues #4‚Äì5 of the 24-issue Godzilla (Aug. 1977 ‚Äì July 1979);Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 180: \\"In August 1977, Marvel produced comics featuring the most famous monster in Japanese cinema, Godzilla, in a series by writer Doug Moench and penciller Herb Trimpe.\\" drew all but one of the 20-issue Shogun Warriors;Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 188: \\"Writer Doug Moench and artist Herb Trimpe created Shogun Warriors, a Marvel comics series based on a line of Japanese toys imported by Mattel.\\" six issues of The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones (also writing the last two); G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #1 (July 1982) and eight other issues, three of which he also wrote or co-wrote;DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 207 nearly the entire run of the 28-issue spin-off G.I. Joe Special Missions (1986‚Äì1989); three of the four-issue miniseries G.I. Joe: The Order of Battle (1986‚Äì1987); and three issues of The Transformers. Trimpe, in a 1997 interview, described his Marvel arrangement: \\"I was a quota artist, which was non-contractual but [I] received a salary. I got a regular two-week check, and anything I did over quota I could voucher for as freelance income. I also had the extras, the company benefits. It was like a regular job, but I worked at home. It was a good deal.\\" =1990s‚Äì2015= When Marvel went bankrupt in the mid-1990s, Trimpe attended Empire State College, Hudson Valley Center, graduating with a bachelor's degree in Arts in 1997. He went on to a master's degree program at SUNY New Paltz. Beginning September 8, 1999, he taught art for two years at Eldred Central School in Sullivan County, New York. Additional WebCitation archive, January 8, 2011. He lost his staff position in the mid-1990s when Marvel downsized, but he continued to freelance for the publisher. In 2000, he wrote an article for The New York Times about ageism in comics. Trimpe penciled BPRD: The War on Frogs (Aug. 2008) for Dark Horse Comics, and returned to his signature character by drawing the eight-page story \\"The Death and Life of the Abomination\\" in Marvel's King-Size Hulk #1 (July 2008). In December 2009, Trimpe, a Bugatti airplane enthusiast and member of the Bugatti Aircraft Association, published the eight-page comic book Firehawks, in which the Bugatti 100P plays a major role. (Requires scrolldown) This was followed by a second Firehawks comic, the 24-page Firehawks 2: Breath of the Dragon. Trimpe's last convention appearance was at the 2015 East Coast Comiccon in Secaucus, New Jersey. Personal life Sometime between 1969 and 1971, Trimpe was divorced from his first wife.Green, Rolling Stone: \\"He's been through a lot of changes in the last two years, including a divorce.

He loved going to the movies and to Yankees games with his father. However, his main love was boxing. When his parents split up, his mother forbade him to pursue the sport. He was not allowed to go to the neighborhood boxing gym anymore because she thought it was too dangerous. During this time, hip hop was considered a fad outside of New York. However, in the Bronx, it was an emerging art form. Bythewood was consumed by the movement. He was a rapper in a neighborhood hip hop crew. During assemblies in junior high school, he and other school mates, were allowed to get on stage and break dance. After junior high, Bythewood's main focus became acting. He went to the High School of Performing Arts as a drama major. However, the school did not allow students to work as professional actors. When Bythewood was cast in the soap opera, \\"Another World\\" during his senior year, he left Performing Arts and attended Quintanos School for the Young Professionals. While on \\"Another World\\" Bythewood acted with Morgan Freeman, Joe Morton, Kyra Sedgwick and many others. After high school, Bythewood acted in a John Sayles film called, \\"The Brother from Another Planet.\\" Sayles inspired Bythewood to write and direct and he shifted his focus away from acting. He graduated from Marymount Manhattan College with a BFA in theater. He co-founded a New York City based theater company called The Tribe which performed plays written and directed by Bythewood. The aim of the theater company was to entertain while raising consciousness. Several activists attended Bythewood's plays including Black Panther Jamal Joseph who became one of his best friends. In 1990, Bythewood was offered a role in the soap opera \\"One Life To Live.\\" However, he turned down the offer and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in screenwriting. He became one of the first members of Walt Disney's prestigious Writers Fellowship Program.

After attending the Million Man March, Bythewood wrote the screenplay for Spike Lee's indie film, \\"Get on the Bus.\\" Bythewood was also one of the film's investors. With the 2007 Writer's Strike looming, Bythewood was hired to do the rewrite for Notorious. He completed several drafts and the film was green lit. When the strike ended, Bythewood went back to the project to do more revisions and stayed on until the film wrapped. He was given written by credit along with the film's initial writer, Cheo Hodari Coker. Bythewood made his feature film directorial debut on the acclaimed indie flick, \\"Dancing in September\\" which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. It was acquired by HBO and became an HBO original movie. Bythewood has also directed, \\"Biker Boyz,\\" the documentary, \\"Daddy's Girl\\" (starring Laila Ali), the 30 For 30 documentary, \\"One Night in Vegas\\" and \\"Gun Hill\\" the two-hour pilot which he won the 2014 NAACP Image Award for.

On March 18, 2019, Plantronics announced that it would change its name to Poly following its acquisition of Polycom. History Early Plantronics headsetIn the early 1960s, airline headsets were so large and cumbersome that many pilots had switched back to the use of handheld microphones for communications. The speed and complexity of jet airliners caused a need for the introduction of small, lightweight headsets into the cockpit. In 1961, United Airlines solicited new designs from anyone who was interested. Courtney Graham, a United Airlines pilot, was one of the many who thought the heavy headsets should be replaced by something lighter. He collaborated with his pilot friend Keith Larkin to create a small, functional design which was robust enough to pass airlines standards. (Larkin had been working for a small company called Plane-Aids, a Japanese import company which offered spectacles and sunglasses that contained transistor radios in their temple pieces.) The final design, incorporating two small hearing aid-style transducers attached to a headband was submitted to United Airline approval. UAL's approval of the innovative design caused Graham and Larkin to incorporate as Pacific Plantronics (now called Plantronics, Inc.) on May 18, 1961. They introduced the first lightweight communications headset, the MS-50, to the commercial marketplace in 1962. In the mid-1960s, the Federal Aviation Agency selected Plantronics as the sole supplier of headsets for air traffic controllers, and thereafter was selected to supply headsets to the operators of the Bell Telephone company. On December 27, 2018, Plantronics agreed to pay $36 million to settle a bribery investigation connected to Polycom, a newly- acquired subsidiary. In 2019, after the Polycom merger, Plantronics rebranded as Poly. SPENCOMM and NASA In 1961, NASA astronaut, Wally Schirra contacted Courtney Graham, a fellow pilot, to discuss creating a design for a small, lightweight headset to be used in the Mercury spacecraft. Pacific Plantronics assembled its Space Environmental Communications (SPENCOMM) division to begin working on a reliable solution. SPENCOMM personnel traveled to NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (now Johnson Space Center) and Kennedy Space Center to meet with and get design feedback from Schirra and several other astronauts, including Gordon Cooper. Neil Armstrong with Plantronics headset Together, SPENCOMM and NASA spent only 11 days to create a working microphone design for space communications and Schirra was the first to use the new communication technology during the Mercury-Atlas 8 mission. Significant redundancy was built into these headsets, as each microphone circuit had two transducers and each receiver had 5 transducers‚Äîin addition, the headsets were used in pairs. The use of these SPENCOMM-NASA headsets in astronaut space suits continued through the remainder of the Mercury program, the Apollo program and on to this day. The words spoken by U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong as he stepped on the moon were transmitted through a Plantronics headset. MS-50 Following the Pacific Plantronics partnership with NASA in the Space Program, the MS-50 headset gained recognition in the communication marketplace. FAA, Western Electric and companies with telephone call centers adapted the MS-50 as a replacement for existing headsets. On May 18, 1965, U.S. Pat. No. 3,184,556 was issued to W. K. Larkin for a Plantronics StarSet patent drawing showing proposed use of invention StarSet In 1970, Ken Hutchings, an engineer who had joined Pacific Plantronics, patented a device which was marketed as the \\"StarSet\\". United States Patent 3548118 describes Wireless products Plantronics office headset on its charger In the 1980s, Plantronics created a line of cordless products using infrared technology. Though the technology utilized was the same one being used by television remote controls, the link did not require a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) telecommunications approval. One of the first products used the infrared beam to create a communications link between a small transmitter and a base unit which was connected to the telephone network. This product was the first \\"echo-free\\" speakerphone for use in conference rooms. The small transmitter could be handheld or clipped to clothing to ensure a good pickup of the speaker's voice. =Wireless office headsets= In 2003, Plantronics introduced the CS50 wireless headset for use on office phones.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 239,987. It was previously known as Alexandro- Grushevskaya (until 1867), Gornoye Grushevskoye Poseleniye (until 1881), Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky (until 1920). History In the beginning of the 19th centuryPospelov, p. 26 sergeant-major Popov founded on the Grushevka River a Cossack stanitsa of Alexandro-Grushevskaya (). While the exact reasoning behind this name is unclear, it is possible that the name was given in honor of Emperor Alexander I. Twelve Cossacks and fourteen peasant serfs lived in the stanitsa at that time. By the mid-19th century, fifty-seven coal mines operated in this area. In 1867, it was granted town status and renamed Gornoye Grushevskoye Poseleniye (). The name was changed to Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky () in 1881. By 1914, the population had reached 54,000. The main source of income was coal mining, which had been carried out in that region since the end of the 18th century. The population was poor, but the town had rail, telegraph and telephone networks, electricity and plumbing as well as libraries, hospitals and a post office. 1917 saw the city change hands three times, until it was taken on April 28, 1919, by the Don Army, under General Fitskhelaurov. For twenty months it was independent of the Bolsheviks, but was ravaged by typhoid. In 1920, the city was given its present name. The name, which literally means mines in Russian, was chosen due to the strong association with coal mining. In 1920‚Äì24 Shakhty were part of Donetsk Governorate of the Ukrainian SSR. During the 1920s, many of the churches and the archives were destroyed. In 1928, the city was the location of the Shakhty Trial, a precursor of the show trials of the 1930s. In 1941, an independent Cossack republic had been declared in Shakhty although this was suppressed by the NKVD before the Russian invasion.p.88, Stalingrad, Antony Beevor In July 1942, during the Great Patriotic War, the city was occupied by the Germans; many coal pits and buildings were blown up by the Germans during their retreat in February, 1943. Twenty-nine of the townsmen were awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1948, production levels in the mines reached what they had been before the war. During the Leonid Brezhnev years, the city was at the height of its development, with a population of over 250,000, and about ten million tons of coal being mined each year. In the 1970s and 1980s, the city was the scene of many of Andrei Chikatilo's murders. Perestroika proved devastating for the city, as mines were privatized and shut down, causing massive unemployment, which led to a severe rise in crime and drug abuse. Today's Shakhty is the main industrial center of the Eastern Donbass. The city is also one of the main producers and exporters of tile in Eastern Europe. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Shakhty Urban Okrug‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #340-ZS As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.Law #191-ZS Demographics The city's population was 239,987 as of the 2010 Census; up from 222,592 recorded in the 2002 Census.

It is located on the southern edge of the M√ºnsterland region near the Ruhrgebiet. The population of Werne is about 32,000.  History  =Middle Ages and early modern period= The Old Town Hall in Werne The first Bishop of M√ºnster, Liudger established Werne as a parish by erecting a chapel in the southern parts of the Dreingau (\\"in pago dreginni\\"). He acted on orders of Charlemagne who, having finally brought the region under the fold of Francia following the conclusion of the Saxon Wars, was eager to press on with Christianization. The Latin text of the oldest preserved document (\\"in villa quae dicitur werina\\"), which dates from 834 and is being kept at the Leiden University Library, indicates that by this time a village had already formed around the chapel. Traders and peasants continued to accrete throughout the next three centuries. At some point between the years 1192 and 1195, the regional bishopric established a customs agency at Werne and put the place under its direct jurisdiction. The year 1253 found Werne in an alliance (the \\"Werner Bund\\") with the cities of M√ºnster, Dortmund, Soest and Lippstadt to defend transit and trading rights relating to a bridge over the Lippe river. In 1470 Werne became a member of the Hanseatic League. A town hall was built from 1512 to 1561. The first moves towards a fortification of Werne date to 1302 when a trench was dug around the church; this was improved and extended to protect the entire settlement in 1383, two years before it received town privileges in 1385. After Adolph I, Duke of Cleves had burned Werne to the ground in 1400, the full fortification of the city commenced in 1415. However, this did not prevent occupation, looting and torching of the city on several occasions during the Thirty Years' War and of course it was no help at all against the Black Death, which killed 313 people (out of a population of about 1,000) in 1636 and 1637 while the war still raged. (Parts of the city wall and some of the towers were pulled down in 1779; the last city gate (the \\"Neutor\\") was demolished in 1843.) The Peace of Westphalia, signed in 1648 at the nearby cities of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, had essentially expelled Protestantism from the Werne region. From 1671 to 1673 the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin erected a monastery and, from 1677 to 1681, the Catholic Church. (The Martin Luther Church at the Wichernstra√üe dates from 1904). =From the Napoleonic time to industrialization= Werne, which had come under the administration of Prussia in 1803 when the Prince-Bishopric of M√ºnster had been dissolved, was attached to the Grand Duchy of Berg by Napoleon in 1806. The Congress of Vienna restored the city to Prussia which incorporated it with other territories into its Province of Westphalia. In 1831 was granted a degree of administrative independence under the Prussian municipal code of 1831. In 1873 and 1874 the search for coal produced a brine thermal spring, and the Werne Baths were established in 1878. The actual coal mine did not commence operations before 1899; it was operated until 1975. Today the buildings of the \\"Zeche Werne\\" have been converted to public meeting places, or are part of a business park. The railway line M√ºnster-Werne- Dortmund was opened in 1928. It had taken a significant amount of lobbying to get Werne a railway station, which was totally refurbished in 2005. A repurposed building of the former \\"Zeche Werne\\" =World War II= During the war, 471 citizens of Werne died and 500 more disappeared without trace. The town accommodated nearly 4,000 refugees. Population The population of the town of Werne (and the ward of Stockum) increased from 1974 to 2003 by about 23%. The proportion of foreigners was about five percent in 2003. In the same year, the ward of Stockum with 4,760 inhabitants presented 14.6% of the population of Werne. The proportion of the Catholic population amounted to 57.4%, the proportion of the Protestant population to 25.0%. 17.6% had no religious affiliation or belonged to another faith. In 2012 Werne had a population of 29,482.Census 2010 (German)  Education and culture  = Schools = * Gymnasium St. Christophorus * Anne-Frank-Gymnasium, municipal high school * Freiherr-vom-Stein vocational school * Konrad-Adenauer- Realschule * Marga-Spiegel-Schule, comprehensive school since August 2012, named after Marga Spiegel, a holocaust survivor * Schule am Windm√ºhlenberg, municipal Hauptschule * Barbaraschule ‚Äì special school, named after Barbara von Nikomedien * Kardinal-von-Galen school, catholic primary school * Uhlandschule, catholic primary school * Weihbachschule, undenominational primaryschool * Wiehagenschule, catholic primary school (also open day school) * Wienbredeschule, catholic primary school (also open day school) * Familienbildungsst√§tte * Folk high school Werne * City library = Stages = * Sylvan theatre Werne * Kolpinghaus Werne = Museums = * Karl Pollender city museum Famous People from Werne *Gabriele Behler, politician, former minister of North Rhine-Westphalia *Theodor Homann, footballer *Mehmet Kara, footballer *Nikolaos Katsigiannis, handball player *Hans-Martin Linde, classical flautist *Lars M√ºller, footballer *Marvin Pouri√©, footballer *Dietrich Schwanitz, writer and literature scientist International relations =Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities= Werne is twinned with: * Bailleul, France, since 1967 * Lytham St. Annes, United Kingdom, since 1984 * Kyritz, Germany, since 1990 * Wa≈Çcz, Poland, since 1992 * Poggibonsi, Italy, since 2000  References  External links  International Club Werne * Pictures and some information in english language about Werne on a German homepage Unna (district) Members of the Hanseatic League Province of Westphalia ","title":"Werne"},{"id":"1779370","text":"'Maeve Ingoldsby (born 1947) is a former writer of the Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann radio show Only Slaggin and former writer on RT√â soap operas Glenroe and Fair City.

Morehead (ed.), 2001.  Rules  As described in Louis Hoffmann's book The Illustrated Book of Patience Games (1892), Nestor is played as follows: *Cards are dealt into eight columns of six cards. They are dealt in such a way that no two cards in the same column have the same rank. To avoid that, the identically ranking card is placed at the bottom of the deck and a new one is dealt. *Once the eight columns are dealt, the four remaining cards are placed either face-up or face-down in a row above or below the columns. These four cards will be the reserve. *Play is composed of removing pairs of cards with the same rank (such as two kings or two 7s). All cards in the reserve and the top card of each column are available for play. Once a pair has been removed, new cards become exposed and available for play. *The game is won once all cards are discarded. Variations An alternate rule in this game is after the eight columns are dealt, the reserve cards are placed as one overlapping row and the top card is the only one available for play. In the variant Vertical, seven columns of six cards each are dealt, with a reserve of 10 cards. With fewer buried cards, this increases the odds of winning. In the variant Doublets, twelve columns of four cards each are dealt, with a reserve of four cards.

Kirk/Spock, commonly abbreviated as K/S or Spirk and referring to James T. Kirk and Spock from Star Trek, is a pairing popular in slash fiction, possibly the first slash pairing, according to Henry Jenkins, an early slash fiction scholar. Early in the history of Star Trek fan fiction, a few fan writers started writing about a romantic and sexual relationship between Kirk and Spock, highlighting a romantic or sexual element to the friendship between the men. As of 1998, most academic studies on slash fiction focused on Kirk/Spock, as Star Trek was by that point one of the longest-lived and most prosperous subjects of slash fiction, while its mainstream popularity made it one of the most accessible titles for academics and their audience,Henry Jenkins, with Cynthia Jenkins and Shoshanna Green,\\"'The Normal Female Interest in Men Bonking': Selections from Terra Nostra Underground and Strange Bedfellows,\\"in Cheryl Harris and Alison Alexander (eds.) Theorizing Fandom: Fans, Subculture, and Identity (Hampton Press, 1998). As the first slash pairing, K/S was created and developed largely independently from the influence of other slash fiction, with most of the conventions of the slash genre seeing their debut first in K/S slash. Origins and creators' responses Many homosocial scenes between Kirk and Spock have been interpreted by some fans as having significant homoerotic undertones. For example, in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Spock realizes that emotions \\"play an important part in the richness of life\\". In a particular scene from the film, Spock, lying down in sickbay, clasps Kirk's hand and says that he understands \\"this simple feeling\\". Woledge points out that both the gesture and the words are \\"ambiguous\\", and can be interpreted as homoerotic. Eye contact and gestures throughout the series have also been cited as being part of a homoerotic subtext in their relationship.Woledge, Elizabeth (August 2005) \\"Decoding Desire: From Kirk and Spock to K/S1\\" Social Semiotics, Volume 15, Issue 2 August 2005, pages 235‚Äì250 In the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture co-written by Gene Roddenberry, a footnote was added where Kirk addresses a rumor that he and Spock were lovers: Another key scene which can be interpreted as homoerotic is in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, when Spock dies, and tells Kirk, \\"I have been and always shall be your friend.\\" In 1985, Roddenberry recalled from publication Killing Time, a novel that suggested the existence of such a relationship between Kirk and Spock. It has also been noted that although Kirk has had many female companions throughout the series, he always leaves them behind, citing his duties to the Enterprise, but he frequently risks the Enterprise and defies his stated duties in order to keep Spock safe. During the production of Shore Leave, writer Theodore Sturgeon suggested, when criticising a scene with McCoy and two women, that \\"the whimsical friction between Bones and Spock\\" should be addressed in a future episode with a prostate massage. Shore Leave also contained a back massage scene where Kirk believes that he is being massaged by Spock. The first known Kirk/Spock fan fiction story was \\"A Fragment Out of Time\\" by Diane Marchant, published in the fanzine Grup #3 (September 1974). It consisted of a sex scene but was written to not identify its participants nor make both of their sexes clear; Marchant stated in the next issue, however, that they were Kirk and Spock. Although many early Star Trek fans were fans of science fiction in general, as the show's popularity increased, it acquired fans who were not general science fiction fans but rather found the show appealed to them as a \\"buddy\\" show, or as a heroic/romantic saga, in which Kirk and Spock were the focus. This led to a quantity of fan fiction about the show focusing on the relationships between characters on the show, with less of an emphasis on science-fictional elements. Many of these fans found that Kirk and Spock's deep friendship was the most interesting topic for writing about Star Trek fan fiction. Such \\"relationship\\" stories (K&S;) were distinct from homoerotic ones (K/S), but both often removed Kirk and Spock from the Enterprise to avoid science fiction \\"distractions\\" like the starship and the Federation. In June 1976, the first Kirk/Spock dedicated fanzine appeared, but as the number of non-science fiction fans grew, within several years \\"relationship\\" stories became the dominant form of Star Trek fan fiction outside the K/S genre. By 1987, 30 K/S fanzines existed to 47 non-K/S. =Other responses= In an interview, after revealing that he had cast Shatner as Kirk partly on the basis of his performance as Alexander, Roddenberry talked about fans seeing a possible parallel between Alexander and Hephaistion and Kirk/Spock: Susan Sackett, Gene Roddenberry's personal assistant for 17 years, sometimes commented on the slash phenomenon. In September 1978, Sackett sent a letter to a UK fan club president commenting on the acceptability of including K/S slash fiction in zines: \\"Gene and the executives at Paramount feel that this is harmful to the STAR TREK concept, since this was never the intention in creating the series.\\" Star Trek: The Original Series writer David Gerrold, has also spoken about K/S slash sometimes. In 1985, Gerrold commented: When asked about whether there was intentional homoerotic content between K/S in the show, and in particular in the episode \\"Amok Time\\", Star Trek's writer D.C. Fontana replied, \\"In answer to your question, NO ‚Äî there were no homosexual double-entendres in the script ‚Äî at least none that were deliberate. If some viewers chose to read that into the dialogue, etc., that's their point of view, but certainly not ours. Writer Theodore Sturgeon was trying to reveal Spock's inner human in a struggle with what his culture, his upbringing and his half-human/half-Vulcan heritage had instilled in him about emotion and controlling it in an out-of- control situation. It also was a peek into the Vulcan culture that no one had seen before. That's ALL we were doing. I've heard this nonsense (especially about Kirk/Spock) for years. There is no basis to it. I hope this answer is helpful to you\\" Common plot devices Placing Kirk/Spock in the Star Trek setting can be beneficial and limiting for K/S authors. Setting the characters there provides familiarity for the audience and means that the author does not need to set up the world so much. However, a difficulty can be that it is necessary to provide an explanation for why the mission is not focused on in the story, in order to focus on the relationship between the two men. Shore leave is a common theme. Pon farr, a physiological response introduced in \\"Amok Time\\" that impelled Vulcans to \\"have sex or die\\", is a device used in some stories such as \\"The Ring of Soshern\\", a pre-1976 fan fiction where Kirk and Spock are marooned on an uncharted planet. However, other writers suggest that it is biologically impossible for a male to consummate pon farr with another male. Furthermore, in the Original Series, it is clearly stated that Vulcans are legally bound with their mate as children. They may neglect the relationship in future years but pon farr compels them to consummate the marriage at the appropriate time. Vulcans must mate or die trying. However, in \\"Amok Time\\", Spock finds that a substitute to giving in to pon farr is to kill another, and thus Spock's pon farr imperative ends after he kills.\\"Amok Time\\" Other common plot element include the plak tow \\"blood fever\\"; the fact that Kirk, because of his empathic bond with Spock, can sense when Spock is about to go into pon farr, which even causes him to suffer some of its symptoms himself; and \\"lingering death\\", the fate of a Vulcan male in pon farr who is unable to claim a mate. Another plot element is the Hurt/Comfort theme; one character is hurt and the other comforts him. Another key element in 'first time' stories and in established relationship stories is the mind meld - either as a way to break the barriers between the men, or as a plot device. Although there is no consensus on how homosexuality is depicted in Star Trek, Woledge suggests that as K/S stories draw on many particular events from the canon of Star Trek, the text itself is homoerotic. Henry Jenkins also notes that particular scenes are singled out by vidders and used in multiple fanvids. Camille Bacon-Smith speculates that K/S is a way for women to \\"openly discuss sexuality in a non-judgmental manner.\\" Kirk and Spock's depiction in K/S zines has been described as \\"two equal individuals who complement each other\\", and a key theme has been that they can continue working and still be a couple, their relationship enhancing their ability to perform competently in their jobs.Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. \\"Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon\\". In Sherrie Inness, ed., Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World. London: Rowman & Littlefield, pp.261-263 , . A fan has said of the pairing: \\"K/S has it all: friendship, relationship drama that gets resolved, enormous expressions of devotion through sacrifice, trust and commitment over a period of decades. It's really hard to find another fictional couple that did all that, and did it as well.\\" After the 2009 film reboot In the 2009 feature film Star Trek, Spock and Nyota Uhura are depicted as a romantic couple. This resulted in some Kirk/Spock slash fans to dislike Uhura, including Henry Jenkins who expressed the opinion that in the 2009 film, Uhura's character is largely there to be the \\"love object\\" in \\"some kind of still to be explored romantic triangle\\" between Kirk and Spock, and to explicitly \\"discourage\\" slashers. Margaret A. Weitekamp and Christine Scodari expressed the opinion that the portrayal of Uhura's character in the reboot is a step forward in terms of the representation of women of color. On August 24, 2013, at the Fan Expo Canada, actor Zachary Quinto (who plays Spock in the rebooted Star Trek) replied to a fan asking him about whether his fictional character (and him and Chris Pine, the actor who plays Jim Kirk in the reboot) are lovers: Notes References * Alexander, A., & Harris, C.

He wrote seven operas, twenty musical comedies, a symphony, three string quartets, more than 200 songs, and many other pieces.  Biography  Born to a wealthy family in Tobolsk in Siberia, Alyabyev learned music in his early years. He joined the Russian Army in 1812, during the Napoleonic War, and fought as an officer until 1823. He participated in the entry of the Russian forces into Dresden and Paris,Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. I, p. 85, Alabiev, Alexander Alexandrovich] and he won two awards. After the mysterious death of a man he spent all night gambling with in February 1825, he was arrested on a charge of murder. While the evidence was not conclusive, Tsar Nicholas I expressly ordered him into exile to his native town of Tobolsk. Freed in 1831, he spent some years in the Caucasus before returning to Moscow, where he died in 1851. The Nightingale Alyabyev's most famous work is The Nightingale (–°–æ–ª–æ–≤–µ–π), a song based on a poem by Anton Delvig. It was composed while Alyabyev was in prison, in 1825. It has entered Russian consciousness as akin to a folk song. The song became more widely known after having been introduced into Rosina's singing lesson scene in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville by Pauline Viardot, followed by Adelina Patti and Marcella Sembrich. Mikhail Glinka wrote piano variations based on the song, as did Mily Balakirev. Franz Liszt also wrote a transcription of it (S. 250/1).

Although it usually has an (embryonal) see, it is often not called after such city but rather after a natural or administrative (in many cases colonial) geographical area. If a prefecture grows and flourishes, it may be elevated to an apostolic vicariate, headed by a titular bishop, in the hope that with time the region will generate enough Catholics and stability for its Catholic institutions, to warrant being established as a diocese. Both these stages remain missionary, hence exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See (notably the Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples), normally not part of an ecclesiastical province. The full sequence of development is: independent mission, apostolic prefecture, apostolic vicariate, apostolic diocese; however steps may be skipped at the papal discretion, so the next steps may be bishopric or even archbishopric. The apostolic prefecture and the apostolic vicariate are to be distinguished from the territorial abbacy (formerly called an \\"abbey nullius\\").  History  During the last centuries of the second millennium it was the practice of the Holy See to govern either through prefects apostolic or apostolic vicariates, many territories where no dioceses with resident bishops were erected and where local circumstances, such as the character and customs of the people or hostility of civil powers, made it doubtful whether an episcopal see could be permanently established. The establishing of a prefecture apostolic in a place supposes that the Church has attained only a small development in the area. Fuller growth leads to the foundation of an apostolic vicariate as an intermediate stage to becoming a diocese. A prefect apostolic is of lower rank than a vicar apostolic. The prefect's powers are more limited and do not normally possess the episcopal character, as is ordinarily the case with a vicar apostolic. The duties of a prefect apostolic consist in directing the work of the mission entrusted to his care; his powers are in general those necessarily connected with the ordinary administration of such an office, for instance: the assigning of missionaries and the making of regulations for the good management of the affairs of the mission. Until the Second Vatican Council, the prefect apostolic had extraordinary faculties for several cases reserved otherwise to diocesan bishops, such as absolutions from censures, dispensations from matrimonial impediments and the faculty of consecrating chalices, patens, and portable altars, with some having the power to administer Confirmation. Prefects apostolic govern independent territories and are subject only to the pope. When a vicariate or a diocese extended over a very large territory in which the Catholic population was unequally distributed, the Holy See sometimes placed a portion of the territory in charge of a prefect apostolic; in which case the faculties of the prefect were more limited, and in the exercise of his office he was supervised by the vicar apostolic or the diocesan bishop. With a view to better protecting the authority of the local vicar apostolic or bishop, it was proposed in the First Vatican Council to abolish prefects apostolic having jurisdiction over districts within a vicariate or diocese of the Latin Rite, but the Council was interrupted and the practice continued until Pope Leo XIII abolished them within the Oriental Churches by a decree of Propaganda Fide on 12 September 1896, and established superiors with special dependence on the papal representatives of the areas concerned. In 1911 there were 66 prefectures apostolic: 5 in Europe; 17 in Asia; 3 in North America (e.g., the Yukon); 11 in South America; 23 in Africa and 7 in Oceania. At the end of 2010, the prefectures apostolic were only 39, of which the vast majority (29) were in PR China (many vacant), where development of the Catholic Church, including that of the prefectures, had long been hindered by actions of the government. The 10 other prefectures included a newly created one for Azerbaijan, 4 more in Asia, 3 in Africa, 1 in the Americas and 1 in Oceania.Annuario Pontificio 2012, pp. 1061-1065  Current apostolic prefectures  = In China = * Ankang ÂÆâÂ∫∑ (Hinganfu) / Ankang * Baojing ‰øùÈùñ / Paoking * Guilin Ê°ÇÊûó / Kweilin * Hainan Êµ∑Âçó / Hainan * Haizhou Êµ∑Â∑û / Haichow * Jiamusi ‰Ω≥Êú®ÊñØ / Kiamusze * Jian‚Ä≤ou Âª∫Áîå / Kienow * Lingling Èõ∂Â≤≠ / Yongzhou Ê∞∏Â∑û / Yungchow * Linqing Ëá®Ê∏Ö / Lintsing * Lintong Ëá®ÊΩº / Lintung * Lixian ÊæßÁ∏£ / Lizhou ÊæßÂ∑û / Lichow * Qiqihar ÈΩäÈΩäÂìàÁàæ / Tsitsibar * Shaowu ÈÇµÊ≠¶ / * Shashi Ê≤ôÂ∏Ç / Shasi * Shiqian Áü≥Èò° / Shihtsien * Suixian Èö®Á∏£ / Suihsien * Tongzhou ÂêåÂ∑û / Tungchow * Tunxi Â±ØÊ∫™ / Tunki * Weihai(wei) Â®ÅÊµ∑Ë°õ / Weihaiwei * Xiangtan ÊπòÊΩ≠ / Siangtan * Xining Ë•øÂØß / Sining * Xinjiang Êñ∞Áµ≥ / Jiangzhou Áµ≥Â∑û / Kiangchow * Xinjiang-Urumqi Êñ∞ÁñÜ-ÁÉèÈ≠ØÊú®ÈΩä / Sinkiang * Xinxiang Êñ∞ÈÑâ / Sinsiang * Yangzhou ÊèöÂ∑û / Yangchow * Yiduxian ÁõäÈÉΩÁ∏£ / Iduhsien * Yixian ÊòìÁ∏£ / Yihsien * Yueyang Â≤≥ÈôΩ / Yuezhou Â≤≥Â∑û / Yochow * Zhaotong Êò≠ÈÄö / Chaotung = Elsewhere in Eurasia = * Battambang in Cambodia * Kompong Cham in Cambodia * Ulaanbaatar in Outer Mongolia * Yuzhno Sakhalinsk in Asian Russia and Japan * Baku, in and covering Azerbaijan (raised to the level of prefecture on 4 August 2011; had been Mission sui iuris of Baku from 11 October 2006) = Americas = * Falkland or Malvinas Islands (U.K.), including South Georgia = Oceania = * Marshall Islands, not exempt but in the ecclesiastical province of Agana. = Africa= * Misurata, in Libya * Robe, in Ethiopia * Western Sahara  Former apostolic prefectures  :(very incomplete) Most former apostolic prefectures were promoted to apostolic vicariate or territorial prelature (under a titular bishop) or (mostly later) to a diocese or even an archdiocese (under a residential bishop), but some ceased to exist (at least under their name or extent) being suppressed or sometimes dismembered. = Europe = * Iceland (promoted Diocese of Reykjav√≠k) * Rhodes and adjacent islands (insular Greece) * Apostolic Prefecture of Scotland (UK)  Germany  * Lausitz (Lusatia) * Schleswig-Holstein = Asia =  Indian subcontinent  * French Colonies in India (then French India) * Jubbulpore * Madura (Diocese of Tiruchirapalli)  Malay countries, notably Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies)  * Bangka and Biliton (now Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang) * Palawan = Americas =  North and central America  * √éles de la Terre Ferme (now Fort-de-France‚ÄìSaint-Pierre) * United States  South America  * Alto Solim√µes (promoted diocese) * Apostolic Prefecture of Araucan√≠a * Tef√© (now Territorial Prelature) * Tumaco = Oceania = * German Solomon Islands * Northern Solomon Islands * South Seas Islands = Africa and Indian Ocean =  North Africa  * Bahr el-Ghazal * Delta of the Nile (Egypt) * Equatorial Nile * Sahara and Sudan  Horn of Africa  * Eritrea  Indian Ocean islands  * Bourbon (then meaning R√©union island)  West Africa  * Bobo-Dioulasso (promoted Archdiocese, in Burkina Faso) * Katanga (then Belgian Congo) * Apostolic Prefecture of Kayes (now Diocese in Mali) * Mupoi (Diocese of Tombura-Yambio) * N‚ÄôZ√©r√©kor√© * Oubangui Chari (French colonial name of Central African Republic; now Metropolitan of Bangui)  See also  * List of Catholic dioceses (alphabetical) * List of Catholic dioceses (structured view) * List of Roman Catholic archdioceses * List of Catholic military ordinariates/(arch)dioceses * List of Catholic apostolic administrations (permanent or ad hoc) * List of Catholic apostolic vicariates * List of Eastern Catholic exarchates * List of Catholic territorial prelatures * List of Catholic missions sui juris  References   Sources and external links  * GCatholic.org - List of Current Apostolic Prefectures; and many other pages Catholic ecclesiastical titles ","title":"Apostolic prefecture"},{"id":"1779415","text":"Harpen-Rosenberg is a statistical area of the city of Bochum in the Ruhr area in Germany.

Homer volunteers to demonstrate this technology and likes it so much that he invests his life savings in the Animotion stock. Two days later, he discovers that the stock has plunged and the company behind the technology has gone out of business. At Moe's Tavern, he tells Barney and Moe about his economic troubles, and Barney suggests that Homer become a human guinea pig to earn money. Homer gets a job at a medical testing center. During one experiment, while commenting on Homer's stupidity, the doctors find a crayon lodged in Homer's brain from a childhood incident when he stuck sixteen crayons up his nose and didn‚Äôt sneeze one of them out. The doctors offer to surgically remove the crayon, and Homer accepts their offer. Homer survives the operation, and his IQ goes up fifty points, allowing him to form a bond with his intelligent daughter Lisa. Homer's newfound brain capacity soon brings him enemies, however, after he performs a thorough report on the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's many hazards, leading to massive layoffs when the plant is shut down until its many problems can be repaired or resolved. When Homer visits Moe's Tavern, he sees an effigy of himself being burnt by his friends who worked at the plant. Homer realizes that due to his improved intelligence, he is no longer welcome and that his life was a lot more enjoyable when he was an idiot. He therefore begs the test center doctors to put the crayon back into his brain. The scientists refuse to do it, but recommend Homer to someone who can: Moe, who is also an unlicensed physician. At his bar, Moe inserts a crayon into Homer's brain, returning him to the idiot he was before. Lisa is initially saddened that she and her father have lost the new connection they shared. However, she finds a note written by Homer before the operation, explaining to her that while he is taking the \\"coward's way out,\\" he has greater appreciation for Lisa after realizing what it is like to be smart like she is. Production Al Jean wrote the episode. The episode was written by Al Jean and directed by Mike B. Anderson as part of the twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000‚Äì2001). The episode is inspired by Flowers for Algernon, the award-winning science fiction work by Daniel Keyes, where an intellectually disabled man also has his intelligence enhanced with an experiment. In particular, the title \\"HOMR\\" is a take on the novel's 1968 film adaptation Charly. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 7, 2001. It was viewed in approximately 10.2 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 10.0, the episode finished 19th in the ratings for the week of January 1‚Äì7, 2001 (tying a 2001 Sugar Bowl pre-game show on ABC). It was the highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week. On August 18, 2009, \\"HOMR\\" was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season. Staff members Mike B. Anderson, Al Jean, Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, and Max Pross participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also featured on the box set. =Critical response= \\"HOMR\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. IGN's Cindy White called it a classic and The Florida Times-Union writer Soyia Ellison named it one of the ten best The Simpsons episodes. The staff of AOL Television listed it at number eighteen on a list of the top twenty best episodes of the series. Nancy Basile of About.com enjoyed the episode, commenting that the storyline was \\"solid and didn't go off track\\" and that the jokes \\"were clever, just like the old days.\\" She added that she \\"was surprised to find Homer even funnier as a genius\\", and praised the many references to popular culture included in the episode, \\"such as Japanimation, smoking, pipe bombs and planned parenthood, ebay and more that I can't remember.\\" Basile was, however, disappointed that the writers put Moe in the role of the unlicensed physician when they had an opportunity to use the character Dr. Nick. Jason Bailey of DVD Talk thought Homer got \\"hilariously smart\\" in \\"HOMR\\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson was less positive, writing in a review that one should not \\"expect a lot of thrills\\" from the episode as he thought it had \\"a moderately rehashed feel\\". He noted that \\"brainy Homer sure does remind me a lot of loquacious Homer from Season Three‚Äôs 'Bart's Friend Falls in Love'.\\" At the 53rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, \\"HOMR\\" won the award for \\"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\\". At the 29th Annie Awards, Jean received a nomination in the category \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television Production\\" for his work on \\"HOMR\\". However, he lost to Ron Weiner‚Äîthe writer of the Futurama episode \\"The Luck of the Fryrish\\".

It forms part of the British New Church Movement, which began in the late 1950s and 1960s combining features of Pentecostalism with British evangelicalism. Other streams of the British New Church Movement with which it shares some features include Together, Ministries Without Borders, and Life- Links. Groups like Pioneer, Ichthus Christian Fellowship, and Vineyard are more distantly related. Newfrontiers describes itself as \\"a group of apostolic leaders partnering together on global mission, joined by common values and beliefs, shared mission and genuine relationships.\\" Its theology is distinctively Reformed. Newfrontiers is committed to building churches according to \\"New Testament principles.\\" One of the slogans of the movement has been \\"changing the expression of Christianity around the world,\\" which is based on a prophecy given by Paul Cain (the Latter Rain revivalist) to the movement in 1990. New Addington Community Church is a Newfrontiers congregation in suburban London. Participation Every Newfrontiers church has its own unique approach to participatory worship, but most commonly, anyone wishing to contribute during corporate worship must first share it with the leader of the meeting. If it is considered to be potentially beneficial to the whole church body, any worship music being played will subside for a moment, and the individual can address the congregation. In other Newfrontiers churches the expectation is that members of the congregation will speak out if they feel they have received an idea, message, (mental) image or verse of Scripture no prior approval is required or expected. Bible weeks The logo for the Stoneleigh Bible Weeks In the early days of the movement a bible week called \\"The Downs\\" was held at Plumpton race course each year. This was replaced by \\"Stoneleigh Bible Week\\", which was held at the National Agricultural Centre showground. After the Stoneleigh Bible Week was stopped a number of smaller more regional events were started, such as \\"North Camp\\" which was held in the North of England near Teesside. After running for 10 years \\"North Camp\\" was to cease after the 2013 event.Then after two years It was started again under a new name : Devoted. Newday is a camping event attended by young people between the ages of 12 and 19. Leadership In each local church leadership is expressed in a plurality of local (male) elders (though generally one of the elders takes a leading or senior role), often with multiple staff. In 2011, Terry Virgo handed over leadership to a score of leaders worldwide, each of whom is described as being \\"free to develop his own strategies, training programs, and gospel advance\\". Theology =Complementarianism= All Newfrontiers churches hold to a complementarian position on gender similar to that promoted by the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. This means that women are not elders or apostolic ministers. However, women are leaders - and in many churches actively preach, teach and are a part of decision making affecting local, regional and national church decisions. Women also hold positions in almost every other area in the church and are encouraged to do so.. =Homosexuality= Newfrontiers do not believe that being gay is a sin, but that sexual acts of homosexuality are not okay. It strongly condemns homophobia. However, views differ from church to church. There have been claims that at least one Newfrontiers church has attempted to \\"cure\\" gay people, though these have been strongly disputed. =Spiritual strongholds= A book by prominent Newfrontiers leader David Devenish on \\"spiritual warfare\\"‚Äîpraised by Terry Virgo as a text that \\"will help to fortify every believer intent on winning this battle\\"‚Äîdefines spiritual warfare as Responses Nigel Wright believes that Newfrontiers and other British restorationists are claiming too much when they speak of \\"restoring the church.\\". In 1986, sociologist and church historian Andrew Walker wrote of Newfrontiers that \\"churches are far more centralised and controlled than those of (...) mainline charismatic fellowships... The situation seems slightly analogous to Japanese business practices: they‚Ä¶ export with great success, but import virtually nothing from anybody else\\".. In April 2009, the Journal of Beliefs and Values published an article reporting on a 2007 study which \\"set out to examine the psychological type profile of Lead Elders within the Newfrontiers network of churches in the United Kingdom and to compare this profile with the established profile of clergymen in the Church of England\\". One of the conclusions: In February 2016, musician Joseph Coward wrote an article for Vice Magazine, in which he described a now disbanded Newfrontiers church. He claimed that it had \\"all the hallmarks of a cult\\". References Further reading * . * . * . * . * .

It was one of the first non- superhero applications of the point-based game system that had been developed for the Champions superhero game. The generalized point system would eventually be published as the Hero System, following in the footsteps of Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing System, but preceding GURPS as a non-genre- specific game system. Publishing history Justice, Inc. was published in July 1984 by Hero Games and was written by Aaron Allston, Steve Peterson and Michael Stackpole. The two-volume set included a rulebook and campaign book containing a discussion of the pulp genre, the \\"Empire Club\\" campaign setting, a timeline of real-world events of the 1920s and 1930s, and several pulp adventures. Two supplements were published: * Lands of Mystery (May 1985), a critically acclaimed sourcebook describing how to design and run \\"Lost World\\" adventures, like those found in the fiction of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard. * Trail of the Gold Spike (August 1984), an adventure set around a Colorado gold mine. Both were written by Allston, and also included statistics for Chill, Call of Cthulhu and Daredevils. Unlike several other products in the \\"Hero\\" line, Justice, Inc. was not revised or republished in the decades after its release. However, Hero Games finally published a Pulp Hero genre book that covers much of the same ground at the end of 2005. System Justice, Inc. used a variation on the point-based rules that were then being published in the Champions superhero game. It placed a heavier emphasis on skills, used lower point totals, and introduced \\"Talents\\" rather than \\"Powers\\", simulating the paranormal (but not superheroic) abilities of genre characters like the Shadow and Fu Manchu. It used most of the \\"Disadvantages\\" of Champions, but halved the points gained from them. Publications * Justice Inc. (1984) * Trail of the Gold Spike (1984), by Aaron Allston * Lands of Mystery (1985), by Aaron Allston () Reception In the December 1984 edition of Imagine (Issue 21), Paul Mason stated, \\"If you like the Champions rules system, and want a campaign set in the era of the pulps, then Justice Inc will be perfect for you. Otherwise I'm afraid I can't recommend it over its competition.\\" In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Space Gamer (No. 72), Allen Varney commented, \\"Justice Inc. is fundamentally solid work, and certainly adaptable to a wide spectrum of pulp-era melodramatics. If your players want lots of variety in one campaign, this is your game! I realize it's a close call, but I'd say that with this publication, Hero Games probably has the strongest roleplaying line on the market.\\" In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Different Worlds (Issue #38), Russell Grant Collins gave this game an average rating of 2.5 stars out of 4, saying, \\"this game is pretty good, although it is marred by a few typos and suffers from incompleteness.\\" Other reviews *Shadis #28 (1996) See also * Justice, Inc. - the pulp magazine story that inspired the game title References External links * Pulp Hero Pulp Hero section on Hero Games' official web site * Aaron Allston's game credits list * Hero Pulp Web Site Dany St-Pierre's fan site * Pulp Review: Justice Inc. by Paolo Marino * Lands of Mystery Supplement review by Kevin Mowery on RPGnet Hero System Historical role-playing games Role-playing games introduced in 1984 ","title":"Justice, Inc.

Each festival involves a torchlit procession by squads of costumed participants (known as guizers) that culminates in the burning of Viking galley. The main festival held in Lerwick, Shetland's capital, involves a procession of up to a thousand guizers who march through the streets of Lerwick on the last Tuesday in January. The other rural festivals (known as the 'country' Up Helly Aas) see lower numbers of participants in accordance with their lower populations. , women and girls have been excluded from participating as guizers in the Lerwick festival. This has become a controversial issue and is the subject of ongoing debate in Shetland. Origins The current Lerwick celebration grew out of the older yule tradition of tar barrelling which took place at Christmas and New Year as well as Up Helly Aa. Squads of young men would drag barrels of burning tar through town on sledges, making mischief. Concern over public safety and levels of drunkenness led to a change in the celebrations, and saw them drawing inspiration from the islands' Viking history. After the abolition of tar barrelling around 1874‚Äì1880, permission was eventually obtained for torch processions. The first yule torch procession took place in 1876. The first torch celebration on Up Helly Aa Day took place in 1881. The following year the torchlit procession was significantly enhanced and institutionalised through a request by a Lerwick civic body to hold another Up Helly Aa torch procession for the visit of Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh.Callum G. Brown, Up- helly-aa: Custom, Culture, and Community in Shetland (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998), , pp. 126-139. The first galley was introduced and burned in 1889. The honorary role of the 'Jarl' was introduced to the festival in the early twentieth century. In reality, despite many sources claiming these ancient origins, the festival, and many like it, were products of Victorian do-goodery. The Lerwick Up-Helly Aa was first established by the Total Abstinence Society in the 1870s to give the young men who would otherwise drink themselves silly something to do. The name itself derives from Upholiday, the lowland Scots' word for Twelfth Day, and was brought by them to the Shetland Islands in the 19th century.Ronald Hutton, The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 43 ff. The modern event There is a main guizer who is dubbed the \\"Jarl\\" (pron. \\"yarl\\"). There is a committee which a person must be part of for 15 years before one can be a jarl, and only one person is elected to this committee each year. The procession culminates in the torches being thrown into a replica Viking longship or galley. The event happens all over Shetland and is currently celebrated at eleven locations ‚Äì Scalloway, Lerwick, Nesting and Girlsta, Uyeasound, Northmavine, Bressay, Cullivoe, Norwick, Waas, the South Mainland and Delting. After the procession, the squads visit local halls (including schools, sports facilities and hotels), where private parties are held. At each hall, each squad performs its act, which may be a send-up of a popular TV show or film, a skit on local events, or singing or dancing. Certain aspects of the festival been changed for the modern day; for example, as of 2020 the use of blackface has been banned at festivals in Shetland. Meaning According to John Jamieson's Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language (1818),. up is used in the sense of something being at an end, and derives from the Old Norse word uppi which is still used in Faroese and Icelandic, while helly refers to a holy day or festival. The Scottish National Dictionary defines helly, probably derived from the Old Norse helgr (helgi in the dative and accusative case, meaning a holiday or festival), as \\"[a] series of festive days, esp. the period in which Christmas festivities are held from 25th Dec. to 5th Jan.\\",, 10 vols., as reproduced in . while aa may represent a', meaning \\"all\\".\\"uphalie-\\", Scottish National Dictionary, reproduced in the Dictionary of the Scots Language. Lerwick Up Helly Aa gallery File:UpHellyAa1(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg1 ‚Äì The Guizer Jarl. The Guizer Jarl is the principal character in the celebration of Up Helly Aa, which takes place on the last Tuesday in January. Each Guizer Jarl takes the name of a figure in Norse legend. This one was Flokki of the Ravens. File:UpHellyAa2(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg2 ‚Äì The Jarl Squad. The Jarl's Squad is made up of the Guizer Jarl's supporters. It is the principal of many squads, and the participants are called guizers. File:UpHellyAa3(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg3 ‚Äì The Galley. Each year a replica of a Viking longship is built for Up Helly Aa. File:UpHellyAa4(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg4 ‚Äì The Procession. After nightfall the longship is dragged through the streets of the town in a torchlight procession. The torchbearers are the members of all the squads, led by the Jarl's Squad. Each squad chooses a theme and dresses accordingly. The themes are very varied, some historical, some topical or satirical. File:UpHellyAa5(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg5 ‚Äì The Circle Round the Galley. When all the torchbearers arrive at the final resting spot of the longship, they form a circle round it and sing the traditional Up Helly Aa song. File:UpHellyAa6(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg6 ‚Äì Setting Fire to the Galley. After the singing of the Up Helly Aa song, the guizers throw their torches into the longship. File:UpHellyAa7(AnneBurgess)30Jan1973.jpg7 ‚Äì The Burning Galley. Once the longship has burned and the flames die down, guizers sing the traditional song \\"The Norseman's Home\\" before going on to a night of partying. Any available large room is pressed into service as a hall, presided over by a hostess who issues invitations to attend, and every guizer squad visits every hall in turn to dance and drink with the guests. As there can be dozens of squads and dozens of halls, this takes most of the night and well into the following morning. The day after is the \\"Hop Night\\" where further dances and celebrations are held.

Rules Initial layout of the game of Agnes The first 28 cards are dealt in the same way as in Klondike. Then a card is placed in the first of the four foundations. This card will be the first card of that foundation and all other cards with the same rank should be placed at the other three foundations. Seven cards are then dealt in a row either above or below the tableau. This will act as the reserve. The cards in the reserve are available for play. Playing the game is a lot like Klondike except that any gaps are filled in by a card a rank lower than the first card of the foundation. For instance, if the first card of each foundation is a 10, gaps are only filled by 9s. Foundations are built up by suit, while the columns on the tableau are built down in alternating colors, wrapping from Ace to King if necessary. When play is no longer possible on the tableau, any card on the reserve can be used to continue the game. Gaps in the reserve are not filled until a new set is dealt. If the game cannot continue even from the reserve, a new set of seven cards is dealt from the stock to the reserve. The stock is good for two deals on the reserve with two cards left over. So after the third new deal and no more moves possible, the two left over cards are dealt as if they each have a reserve pile on their own. The game is won when all cards have made their way to the foundations. Variations There are two versions of the game of Agnes, the one described above being Agnes Bernauer. In Agnes Sorel, the game is played the same way except that the cards in the tableau are built down by color (i.e. red suits on red, black suits on black), and spaces are not filled. David Parlett gave both versions their separate names. Agnes Bernauer was created by Parlett, and named after the mistress of Albert III, Duke of Bavaria, whose father was unhappy with their relationship, and had Agnes drowned in the Danube River. Agnes Sorel has no connection to the woman of that name. References * Bonaventure, George A. Games of Solitaire * Morehead, Albert H. & Mott-Smith, Geoffrey.

Though most of her music is released in Japan, she does her work primarily from Gotland in Sweden, mainly doing promotional videos, photo shoots and recording there. She originally debuted in 1999 under Universal Music Japan using her real name, Watanabe Mizuki, releasing two singles. In 2003, she began working with the Swedish producer Tord Backstrom and debuted under Victor Entertainment with the pseudonym Miz in 2004. That same year, she released an English album in Sweden, with the lead single \\"Waiting\\" reaching #8 on the Hitlistan Swedish singles chart. In 2007, Watanabe returned to Universal Music Japan, changed her stage name to Mizrock, and released her first mini-album Good bye, yesterday and three singles. However, in 2009 she announced on her official blog that she had changed her stage name back to Miz. Her biggest hits in Japan are \\"New Day\\" and \\"In The Sky\\", the theme song for the Square Enix role-playing video game Grandia III.  Biography  At a very young age, Miz expressed a great interest and talent in music. She always wanted to become one of the singers on the radio, but living in such a rural area as Hokkaid≈ç, there were very few opportunities for her. One of Miz's biggest hobbies during her high school years was going to a local beauty salon. And since she was a regular customer, she became very good friends with the salon manager. At this time there was held a talent competition, with advertising posters put up in over 20,000 beauty salons all over Japan. The salon owner suggested that Miz enter the contest, which she won from hundreds of other competitors. Mizrock entered the nationwide beauty contest \\"'99 Princess Audition\\", and was the winner out of the 3,200 entrants. After graduating from high school, she moved to Tokyo. Soon afterward, she was signed under Universal Victor and, under her real name, released I WILL(TX TV show Renai Slot Kuru Kuru V 's ending theme song), her first single. Five months later, she released a second single called \\"Ambition\\"(PlayStation game Kouklo Theatro 's theme song). Neither single charted in the top 100 singles and she was not asked to release anything else after that. Both singles are now out of print in most Japanese CD stores. Mizrock wrote the lyrics to all four of the songs on these singles. In August 2001, a song of hers, \\"Aoi Kioku\\", was used as the image song in the PC game Hello, world appearing in October the following year, when it was released on the soundtrack for the game. After the release of Ambition, her career stalled. She kept taking singing lessons at a studio, and eventually made a demo tape with the help of a writer. She was introduced to a producer named Tord B√§ckstr√∂m, who was looking for someone to perform a song written by a Swedish writer. In 2003, she travelled to Sweden and her first single, \\"Waiting\\", entered the charts at #8. Five months later, Miz released her second single, \\"New Day\\". The single entered the charts at #20, and is currently her biggest single. Her album, Story Untold, was released on September 22, 2004, and contains ten all-English songs. By that time, she had also released some other music. Her Japanese comeback single, \\"New Day\\", came out in 2004, entering the Oricon charts at #20. Five months later, her second single, \\"Waiting for\\", was released. Later in the month in Japan, Miz's first album Say It's Forever was released, reaching #20 in Japan, spending two weks at #1 in Taiwan. Half of the album used Miz's own lyrics. To promote her first Japanese album, Miz was invited to a Channel V-hosted concert in Taiwan along with other local and foreign artists, where she performed three songs, \\"New Day\\"\\", Waiting for\\" and \\"Say It's Forever\\". She also attended an AIUEO show to gain more publicity in her short visit. (The host was apparently her friend before she made her first major recording in Japan.) She became one of the most popular Japanese artists in Taiwan that year. In November, Miz released a separate, English language album in Sweden called Story Untold, but it failed to get into the top 60. A special version was released with the entire Say It's Forever album on a bonus disc. In 2005, Miz released her third album, DREAMS, in Japan. The album included the bulk of Miz's Swedish release album, though with a few omissions and some new songs. In August, Miz released two items: a photobook called \\"An Ordinary Day\\" about Miz in Sweden and the \\"In The Sky\\" single (the game Square Enix's Grandia III theme song). \\"In The Sky\\" was the Japanese version of a song from Story Untold called \\"Amazing\\". (For the English language release of the game a separate English version was recorded with different lyrics). Two new singles were quickly released in the following months: a Japanese version of \\"Backseat Baby\\" from her Swedish album in late 2005 and a completely new song, \\"Bittersweet\\", in 2006. These were followed by her second album, Mizrock. After releasing Mizrock in February 2006, Miz disappeared for a long while. In May 2007, however, her official website was updated with news of a new release coming in July. Other websites such as ORICON and Tower Records confirmed this, listing a mini-album titled Good bye, yesterday to be released under the name \\"Mizrock\\". It is also with this album that Miz moved from Victor Interactive to Nayutawave Records. In June 2007, \\"Good bye, yesterday\\" from her Good bye, yesterday album was used as the second ending song for the anime, Romeo X Juliet. In October 2007 she released a new single, \\"Best Friend\\", and in February 2008 \\"Thank You\\". On May 3, 2010, Miz updated her blog with a link to information regarding her new single, \\"'Faraway\\", released on May 26, 2010, under the name of \\"Miz\\" for the first time in four years. A new single by Miz, \\"Just Try\\", was scheduled to be released on July 24, 2011.http://mammoth-pro.com/justtry.html She took part in reality show \\"Otoboke House\\" and in the program \\"POPS\\". For her role plays are: Maureen in \\"Rent\\" (2010), \\"I got Merman\\" (2012) and Candy in \\"Tatoo 14\\" (2012). On September 16, 2014, the Korean girl group, TTS (TaeTiSeo), a subunit of Girls' Generation, released Holler, which is a cover of Miz's song, \\"Hello Me!\\". Following on September 18, 2014, Miz announced her marriage and stated that she will be taking a break from her music career.http://ameblo.jp/mizrock/entry-11926584457.html  Discography  = Mizuki Watanabe = ;Singles * \\"I Will\\" (June 18, 1999) ::TV Tokyo's Show ending theme song * \\"Ambition\\" (November 24, 1999) :: PlayStation Game theme song.

Because his father, Ernest, ruling Duke of Bavaria at the time, considered this liaison with a commoner unbefitting his son's social standing, he clashed with his son over the matter and finally arranged to have Agnes condemned for witchcraft and drowned in the Danube in 1435. Her life and death have been depicted in numerous literary works, the most well known being Friedrich Hebbel's tragedy of the same name and the folk musical Die Bernauerin by the composer Carl Orff. Biography Agnes Bernauer was probably born around 1410; nothing is known of her childhood and youth. She is traditionally considered to have been the daughter of the Augsburg barber surgeon Kaspar Bernauer, whose existence has, however, not yet been proved. Since Ernest's son Albert participated in a tournament in Augsburg in February 1428, it is generally assumed that the latter met Agnes on that occasion and shortly thereafter brought her to Munich.On Agnes Bernauer's origins see Marita Panzer's discussion of Kaspar Bernauer in Agnes Bernauer, pp. 11‚Äì15; on the tournament see Chronik des Hektor M√ºlich 1348‚Äì1487 in: Die Chroniken der schw√§bischen St√§dte. Augsburg. vol. 3, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 1965, p. 70 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 13). Referring to the meagre evidence for Agnes' origins in Augsburg, Claudia M√§rtl in Straubing, p. 154, assumes that she was a servant at the Munich court and there aroused the interest of Albert. Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, p. 36f. and p. 170, comment. 32, rejects this supposition. In a Munich tax roll dated 1428, a ‚Äúpernawin‚Äù is listed as a member of his royal household, which is probably a reference to Agnes Bernauer. In summer 1432 at the latest, Agnes Bernauer was an integral part of the Munich court. She took part in the capture of the robber baron M√ºnnhauser, who had fled to the Old Court in Munich, and she annoyed the Palatine Countess Beatrix, Albert's sister, because of her self- assured manner.On Agnes Bernauer in M√ºnchen see 1) Stadtarchiv M√ºnchen, Steueramt Nr. 584, fol. 42 r (following Marita Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, p. 36f); 2) Stadtarchiv M√ºnchen, Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1431/32, fol. 50 v (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 13, cf. Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, p. 38f; 3) Stadtarchiv M√ºnchen, Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1431/32, fol. 51 r (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 15, cf. Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, p. 41. It is possible that Agnes and Albert were already married at this point, but there is no concrete evidence of a marriage ceremony. Albert's frequent residence at Blutenburg Castle beginning in 1433 and the sale of two properties in the vicinity to Agnes suggest that the couple lived there together.Deed of purchase from the parish of Aubing. In: Ernst Gei√ü: Beitrag zur Geschichte der Agnes Bernauer, in: Oberbayerisches Archiv. vol. 7, 1846, p. 303f. (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 16). See Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, p. 43f. and the reference to Johannes Erichsen: Umrisse Blutenburger Geschichte, in: Claus Grimm (ed.): Blutenburg. Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte von Schlo√ü und Hofmark Menzing. Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte, M√ºnchen 1983, p. 26ff. There is no evidence of joint residence in Albert's county of Vohburg, and there are no known descendants of the couple.Gottfried Horchler argues against a marriage ceremony in Agnes Bernauer in Geschichte und Dichtung. 1. Teil, Attenkofer, Straubing 1883, pp. 11‚Äì14. Sigmund Riezler argues for a secret marriage known only to a few insiders, see Agnes Bernauerin und die bairischen Herzoge in: Sitzungsberichte der K√∂niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Historische Classe. Jahrgang 1885, pp. 294‚Äì301. The children who are repeatedly mentioned as theirs, Sibilla Neufarer and Albert vom Hof, cannot have had Agnes Bernauer as their mother: Sibilla's father was Albert III, but she married for the second time already in 1444 and already had a son at that time. Albert vom Hof was an illegitimate son of Albert IV and was born only in 1447. Cf. Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, pp. 52‚Äì56. Duke Ernest, Albert's father, was infuriated by the threat to the succession posed by his only son's unsuitable liaison. While Albert was on a hunt arranged by his relative Henry of Bavaria-Landshut, Duke Ernest had Agnes arrested and drowned in the Danube River on 12 October 1435 near Straubing.Andreas von Regensburg: Chronica de principibus terrae Bavarorum, in: Georg Leidinger (ed.): S√§mtliche Werke. Rieger, M√ºnchen 1903, p. 583f. (written before 1444; following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 55). Albert then went to Ingolstadt to Duke Louis VII, but after a few months was reconciled with his father and married Anna of Brunswick in November 1436.Financial records concerning events up to the marriage of Albert and Anna: 1) Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1435/36, fol. 45 r; 1434/35 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 26). 2) Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1434/35 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 26). 3) Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1435/36, fol. 57 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 32, p. 40). 4) Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1435/36, fol. 59 v (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 44). 5) Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1435/36, fol. 49 v; Kammerrechnung Stadt M√ºnchen 1436/37, fol. 56 v (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 47f.). The feared military conflict between father and son did not materialize; it is possible that Emperor Sigismund exerted a restraining effect on Albert. Tributes to her memory Death of Agnes Bernauer In December 1435, Albert endowed a perpetual mass and an annual memorial celebration in the Straubing Carmelite Cloister in memory of Agnes Bernauer. In 1447 he expanded the endowment in her honor. In 1436, his father had an Agnes Bernauer Chapel erected in the cemetery of St. Peter Straubing, probably to appease his son.Ducal documents dated 1435: 1) Bayerisches Hauptstaatsarchiv, F√ºrstensachen IV, fol. 213‚Äì214 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 24f.); 2) F√ºrstensachen IV, fol. 300‚Äì301 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, pp. 26‚Äì32), see also Marita Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, pp. 89‚Äì92; 3) F√ºrstensachen IV, fol. 307 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 32, p. 38). It is not known whether Agnes was buried in the Carmelite cloister, which was her wish, or whether Albert arranged for the transfer of her mortal remains to the chapel dedicated to her. In any event, a tombstone of red marble with an almost life-size effigy of Agnes Bernauer was fitted into the floor of the chapel. The relief shows her lying with her head on a large pillow. In her right hand, on which she wears two rings, she holds a rosary, and two small dogs at her feet are there to guide her on her way to the hereafter. It was probably an oversight that the year of her death is incorrectly given there as 12 October 1436.)For a description and illustration of the tombstone see Marita Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, pp. 118‚Äì121. There are only a few records about the memorial endowments for Agnes Bernauer from the next three centuries. In 1508 a certain Johannes Haberlander was the chaplain responsible for the Bernauer Chapel. For its maintenance and the daily reading of the memorial mass he received 17 pounds in Regensburg pence from the ducal treasury. By 1526 his office had been transferred to a Leonhard Plattner, who received for his services 48 guilders and 4 schilling in Viennese pence.On the church visitation of 1508: Paul Mai, Marianne Popp: Das Regensburger Visitationsprotokoll von 1508. In: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte des Bistums Regensburg. vol. 18, 1984, p. 48 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 66f.). On the church visitation of 1526: Paul Mai: Das Regensburger Visitationsprotokoll von 1526. In: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte des Bistums Regensburg. vol. 21, 1987, p. 73 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, S. 74). It is not known how long the chaplain's office was maintained. All that is known is that the church trustee Franz von Paula Romayr had the tombstone moved to the wall of the chapel in 1785 in order to protect it from further damage ‚Äúcaused by depredatory footsteps‚Äù. The grave itself could not be located when the tombstone was repositioned.On the repositioning of the tombstone see the correspondence between Romayr and the Elector in Gottfried Horchler: Agnes Bernauer in Geschichte und Dichtung. 1. Teil, Attenkofer, Straubing 1883, p. 44f. On the missing grave: Franz Sebastian Meidinger: Historische Beschreibung der kurf√ºrstl. Haupt- und Regierungs-St√§dte in Niederbaiern Landshut und Straubing. Hagen, Landshut 1787 (following Alfons Huber, Agnes Bernauer im Spiegel der Quellen, p. 128, and Marita Panzer, Agnes Bernauer, p. 121f.). Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 19th century the Agnes Bernauer Chapel became a tourist destination. One newspaper (the Bayerische National-Zeitung) even asserted it as being the only reason to pay a visit to Straubing. The locals were happy to supply visitors with information, not all of it reliable. One concerned reader wrote to the K√∂niglich-Bairische Intelligenzblatt in 1813 that the sexton had informed him that Austrian troops had walked off with the remains of Agnes Bernauer. When the German poet August von Platen inspected the gravestone in 1822, he heard from the female sexton that Agnes and Albert had been switched as infants so that she was actually the duke's daughter and he the son of the barber-surgeon, but that the book which would have confirmed this exchange had been stolen by French soldiers.On the chapel and its visitors see 1) Die Agnes Bernauer-Kapelle in Straubing in: Bayerische National-Zeitung.

A detail of her epitaph in the Agnes Bernauer Chapel After excavations in the Chapel at St. Peter failed to produce any results, the Bernauer biographer Felix Joseph Lipowsky had the Carmelite cloister grounds searched in 1897 for evidence of her grave. He found in the cloister archives a note indicating that the grave was in the former Nicholas chapel of the cloister church, but this chapel had been converted to a sacristy after 1692 and the vault underneath filled in. Lipowsky could only assume that her remains were reburied elsewhere during the reconstruction work. Despite subsequent searches, her grave remains undiscovered.On the excavations in the Carmelite cloister: 1) Anniversar- Register im Archiv des Karmelitenklosters f√ºr 1447, p. 29.

Zeitschrift f√ºr die Geschichte, L√§uterung und Fortbildung der deutschen Sprache.

The Bavarian king Ludwig I, who had himself visited the Agnes Bernauer Chapel in 1812 when he was crown prince and later dedicated a poem to Agnes, saw to it that at least the masses for Agnes and Albert were again read in the Carmelite church. Since 1922, only one memorial mass is celebrated annually, due to financial limitations; it is paid for by the Bavarian government. In 2013 at the Blutenburg Castle there was erected the Sculpture of Agnes Bernauer with Albert III, Duke of Bavaria by Joseph Michael Neustifter. The memorial was funded by Ursula und Fritz Heimb√ºchler. Adaptations Albert and Agnes' tragic love story has long been a staple of folk songs, and over the centuries many new literary and musical versions have been created. * Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau: Liebe Zwischen Hertzog Ungenand und Agnes Bernin, Poem, 1680 * Joseph August Graf von Toerring: Agnes Bernauer, Vaterl√§ndisches Schauspiel, Play, 1780 * Georg Joseph Vogler (Music), Carl Theodor Traitteur (Libretto): Albert der Dritte von Bayern, Singspiel, UA M√ºnchen 1781 * Franz Glei√üner (Music): Agnes Bernauerin, Melodrama, probably after Toerring, 1781, UA M√ºnchen 1790 * Ignaz von Seyfried (Music, Karl Ludwig Giesecke (Libretto): Agnes Bernauerin (burlesque), 1798 * Karl August Krebs (Music): Herzog Albrecht, Opera, UA Hamburg 8 October 1833 (revised version: Dresden 1858 as Agnes Bernauer) * King Ludwig I of Bavaria: An Agnes Bernauerin, Poem * Adolf B√∂ttger: Agnes Bernauer, Drama, 1846 * Melchior Meyr: Herzog Albrecht, Drama, 1852 * Friedrich Hebbel: Agnes Bernauer - Ein deutsches Trauerspiel in f√ºnf Aufz√ºgen, Drama, 1855 * Otto Ludwig, several versions of a drama, 19th century * Martin Greif: Agnes Bernauer oder der Engel von Augsburg, Drama, 1894 * Eugen Hubrich: Die Agnes Bernauer zu Straubing, Open-air Play, 1935.

When this compressed executable is executed, the decompression code recreates the original code from the compressed code before executing it. In most cases this happens transparently so the compressed executable can be used in exactly the same way as the original. Executable compressors are often referred to as \\"runtime packers\\", \\"software packers\\", \\"software protectors\\" (or even \\"polymorphic packers\\" and \\"obfuscating tools\\"). A compressed executable can be considered a self-extracting archive, where a compressed executable is packaged along with the relevant decompression code in an executable file. Some compressed executables can be decompressed to reconstruct the original program file without being directly executed. Two programs that can be used to do this are CUP386 and UNP. Most compressed executables decompress the original code in memory and most require slightly more memory to run (because they need to store the decompressor code, the compressed data and the decompressed code). Moreover, some compressed executables have additional requirements, such as those that write the decompressed executable to the file system before executing it. Executable compression is not limited to binary executables, but can also be applied to scripts, such as JavaScript. Because most scripting languages are designed to work on human-readable code, which has a high redundancy, compression can be very effective and as simple as replacing long names used to identify variables and functions with shorter versions and/or removing white-space.  Advantages and disadvantages  Software distributors use executable compression for a variety of reasons, primarily to reduce the secondary storage requirements of their software; as executable compressors are specifically designed to compress executable code, they often achieve better compression ratio than standard data compression facilities such as gzip, zip or bzip2 . This allows software distributors to stay within the constraints of their chosen distribution media (such as CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or Floppy disk), or to reduce the time and bandwidth customers require to access software distributed via the Internet. Executable compression is also frequently used to deter reverse engineering or to obfuscate the contents of the executable (for example, to hide the presence of malware from antivirus scanners) by proprietary methods of compression and/or added encryption. Executable compression can be used to prevent direct disassembly, mask string literals and modify signatures. Although this does not eliminate the chance of reverse engineering, it can make the process more costly. A compressed executable requires less storage space in the file system, thus less time to transfer data from the file system into memory. On the other hand, it requires some time to decompress the data before execution begins. However, the speed of various storage media has not kept up with average processor speeds, so the storage is very often the bottleneck. Thus the compressed executable will load faster on most common systems. On modern desktop computers, this is rarely noticeable unless the executable is unusually big, so loading speed is not a primary reason for or against compressing an executable. On operating systems which read executable images on demand from the disk (see virtual memory), compressed executables make this process less efficient. The decompressor stub allocates a block of memory to hold the decompressed data, which stays allocated as long as the executable stays loaded, whether it is used or not, competing for memory resources with other applications all along. If the operating system uses a swap file, the decompressed data has to be written to it to free up the memory instead of simply discarding unused data blocks and reloading them from the executable image if needed again. This is usually not noticeable, but it becomes a problem when an executable is loaded more than once at the same time‚Äîthe operating system cannot reuse data blocks it has already loaded, the data has to be decompressed into a new memory block, and will be swapped out independently if not used. The additional storage and time requirements mean that it has to be weighed carefully whether to compress executables which are typically run more than once at the same time. Another disadvantage is that some utilities can no longer identify run-time library dependencies, as only the statically linked extractor stub is visible. Also, some older virus scanners simply report all compressed executables as viruses because the decompressor stubs share some characteristics with those. Most modern virus scanners can unpack several different executable compression layers to check the actual executable inside, but some popular anti-virus and anti-malware scanners have had troubles with false positive alarms on compressed executables. In an attempt to solve the problem of malware obfuscated with the help of runtime packers the IEEE Industry Connections Security Group has introduced a software taggant system. Executable compression used to be more popular when computers were limited to the storage capacity of floppy disks, which were both slow and low capacity media, and small hard drives; it allowed the computer to store more software in the same amount of space, without the inconvenience of having to manually unpack an archive file every time the user wanted to use the software. However, executable compression has become less popular because of increased storage capacity on computers. It has its use in the demoscene where demos have to stay within a size limit like 64 kilobytes to enter some competitions. Only very sophisticated compression formats, which add to load time, keep an executable small enough to enter these competitions.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 1, 2001\\\\. When the Simpsons run out of food thanks to a bag boy strike, the family finds an old box of Animal Crackers in their attic. In the box is a golden cracker that was part of a contest conducted by the owners of Animal Crackers. Finding out that anyone that found the golden cracker would win a trip to Africa, Homer shows it to the company's owners, who refuse to honor the prize. When he is injured by one of the box's sharp corners however, the family is given a free trip to Africa as compensation. Although \\"Simpson Safari\\" was written by John Swartzwelder, the idea for the episode was pitched by a former staff writer Larry Doyle. The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland, who had been to Africa as a child. Because of his visit there, Kirkland attempted to make the episode look as authentic as possible, even though the Simpsons trip to Africa was \\"all over the place\\" geographically. The episode features Frank Welker as all the animals in Africa. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.7 million viewers, finishing in 42nd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The episode was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 2001. Plot While Marge takes Maggie to the hospital after Maggie swallowed an issue of Time magazine whole, Homer, Bart and Lisa go grocery shopping. Homer and other shoppers at the store mistreat the bag boys, which results in every bag boy in Springfield going on strike. Presumably and strangely having no ability to shop without bag boys to pack their bags, they are unable to buy more food. When the Simpsons run out of food in their home, the family follows Santa's Little Helper into the attic, where he finds a 30-year-old box of animal crackers. Homer bites into a solid-gold giraffe, which is the winning contest piece for a trip to Africa. The animal cracker company initially refuses to honor the prize because the contest ended a number of years ago. But when Homer is hit in the eye by a sharp corner of the box, the company gives the Simpsons their Africa trip in order to avoid a lawsuit. The family lands in Tanzania. When the family is in Africa, their tour guide Kitenge takes them to experience such sights as the Masai Mara, Ngorongoro Crater, Olduvai Gorge, and meet with a group of Maasai tribesmen. During a vigorous tribal dance, Homer manages to enrage a hippo. It chases after the family, but they escape by using a tribal shield as a raft going down a raging river. After surviving the plunge over Victoria Falls, the family eventually reaches Mount Kilimanjaro and stumbles upon a nearby chimpanzee sanctuary maintained by the scientist Dr. Joan Bushwell (a parody of Jane Goodall). She claims to be researching the animals behavior when a group of poachers arrive to take the chimps. The Simpsons try to hold the poachers but eventually they break into the sanctuary. The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists, who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a chimp slave master, exploiting their labor at a nearby diamond mine. Worried that the Simpsons will report her to the authorities, Dr. Bushwell offers everyone diamonds as a bribe ‚Äì which all the Simpsons except Lisa happily accept. On the plane ride back to Springfield, it is revealed that their former tour guide, Kitenge, is now president of the country, with the former president now the Simpsons' flight attendant. Production \\"Simpson Safari\\"'s setpiece shows some of Springfield's citizens mistreating the bag boys in a grocery store, prompting the bag boys to go on strike. The sequence was inspired by an Albertsons store in Los Angeles, whose employees went on strike at the time the episode was written. The idea to have the Simpsons visit Africa was pitched by former staff writer Larry Doyle.Maxtone- Graham, Ian. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpson Safari\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Former staff writer John Swartzwelder was then assigned to write the first draft of the episode's script. Because of his involvement with the episode, \\"Simpson Safari\\" contains several \\"classic\\" Swartzwelder-type jokes, according to staff writer Matt Selman. Examples of these include the cover of the Animal Cracker box and Homer and Dr. Joan Bushwell's discussion about the smell of feces in the doctor's hut. After Swartzwelder wrote the first draft, the writing staff rewrote the script. When writing the episode, the writers deliberately included factual errors to annoy viewers who wanted the series to seem realistic. Commenting on the episode, Selman said \\"It's kind of a combination of really nice, observational designs and then just [...] things that are deliberately wrong. To anger people who care about things being real.\\"Selman, Matt. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpson Safari\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Mark Kirkland, who had visited Africa before, served as the director for \\"Simpson Safari\\". When he was sixteen years old, Kirkland spent six weeks in Kenya with a film crew that was making a documentary film called A Visit to a Chief's Son. When he first read the script, he found that the episode was \\"all over the place\\" geographically. \\"It would be like in the United States, saying: 'I walked out of Grand Central Station and then I turned left and was standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon.' The locations are just all over the place\\" he said in the episode's DVD commentary. Still, Kirkland strove to make the episode look as realistic as possible by drawing influence from his experience in Kenya. For example, the steering column on Kitenge's Land Rover is placed on the right side of the car. At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Maasai people, a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode are dancing is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life, and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people's culture, the use of lip plates and neck rings are not. \\"That was kind of fun for me to try to make this stuff [...] as crazy as the story is, [to] make it realistic\\", Kirkland commented on directing the episode.Kirkland, Mark. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpson Safari\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In a scene in the episode, the Simpsons are floating down a river on a shield. At one point, the family is seen by two Africans, who speak in Kiswahili. Additionally, the song that Kitenge sings when driving the Simpsons (\\"W√©-W√©\\" by Ang√©lique Kidjo) was a popular song in Africa. In order to make it sound accurate, Hank Azaria, who portrays Kitenge in the episode, was taught to sing the song phonetically by a professor in Swahili in the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Joan Bushwell, the \\"Jane Goodall-type\\" character in the episode, was portrayed by American voice actress Tress MacNeille, who also voices Lindsey Naegle among other characters in the series. All animals' noises (except for Santa's Little Helper, who is voiced by main cast member Dan Castellaneta) were done by American voice actor Frank Welker. Release In its original American broadcast on April 1, 2001, \\"Simpson Safari\\" received a 7.5 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.7 million viewers. The episode finished in 42nd place in the ratings for the week of March 26-April 1, 2001, tying with an episode of the television newsmagazine Dateline NBC. Later that year, the episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore). It ultimately lost to an episode of the science fiction series Star Trek: Voyager. Since its broadcast, the episode has been released twice on home video. On May 23, 2005, it was released along with the season 10 episode \\"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\\", the season 13 episode \\"Blame It on Lisa\\" and the season 15 episode \\"The Regina Monologues\\" as part of a DVD set called Simpsons Around The World In 80 D'ohs. On August 18, 2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tim Long, Yeardley Smith, Mark Kirkland and Michael Marcantel participated in the audio commentary for the episode.Scully, Mike. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpson Safari\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Former The Simpsons showrunner Mike Reiss stated, at an April 2007 talk in Bristol, Connecticut, that \\"Simpson Safari\\" is one of two of the show's episodes that he dislikes. Following its home video release, \\"Simpson Safari\\" received mixed reviews from critics. In his review of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide described the episode as \\"lousy\\". While he admitted that he found a couple of scenes funny, he argued that the episode over relied on broad gags and \\"never threatens to become inspired or amusing\\". He concluded by describing the episode as \\"disappointing\\". Writing for Bullz-Eye.com, Will Harris gave the episode a negative review as well. He argued that the premise was \\"ridiculous\\", and that the episode \\"remind[s] longtime fans that the show's days of complete comedic perfection are behind them.\\" On the other hand, DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire was entertained by the episode. Although he mostly enjoy episodes that are \\"down-to-Earth\\" and emphasize the Simpson family, McEntire wrote that the \\"less realistic, more over-the-top crazy\\" episodes like \\"Simpson Safari\\" comprises the season's best episodes. DVD Talk's Jason Bailey wrote that \\"Simpson Safari\\" makes use of one of his favorite story elements that he called a \\"wandering storyline\\". \\"Their habit of using the first act as a red herring, only semi-connected to the rest of the show, is ingenious and hilarious\\", he wrote. \\"'Simpson Safari', for example, begins with an extended bit about a bagboy strike, which leads the family to desperate culinary measures, which then leads Homer to a box of animal crackers in the attic, which then leads to the discovery of a prize inside the box for the safari trip that encompasses the rest of the episode. They'd been doing this kind of thing for years, but it still plays\\".

The International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience commonly referred to as IAESTE (pronounced i-a-es-te or ai-es-te) is an international organization exchanging students for technical work experience abroad. Students gain relevant technical training lasting from 4 weeks to 52 weeks. IAESTE includes committees representing more than 80 countries, with the potential of accepting new countries into the organization every year. At the general conference 2005 held in Cartagena, Colombia, the statute and by-laws of IAESTE a.s.b.l. were established, making IAESTE a registered \\"associacion sans but lucratif\\" (non-profit organization), with the centre in Luxembourg. The current President is Thomas Faltner from Austria. IAESTE's motto is \\"Work, Experience, Discover\\". IAESTE's aims are to connect students with employers in foreign countries, provide university students with technical experience and culturally enrich students and their host communities. History IAESTE was founded in 1948 at Imperial College, London. The Imperial College Vacation Work Committee headed by Mr. James Newby initiated a meeting with national organizations from 10 European countries in a post war effort to promote better understanding between countries and cultures. Since 1948, the association has grown to include more than 80 countries worldwide and has exchanged in excess of 300,000 students. IAESTE exchanges around 7000 students annually playing an important role in giving technical undergraduates practical work experience and a global perspective. Organization structure =International organization structure= The IAESTE Association is a confederation of National Committees representing academic, industrial and student interests. Coordinating the daily administration of the association is the responsibility of the President. The President is elected for two years and is responsible for the General Conference or the GC as it is called in IAESTE. The GC makes the formal decisions in IAESTE and is composed of one delegate (National Secretary) from each country. The GC meets every year in January and is a forum for discussion. The Board is an elected body which prepares the work of the General Conference and advises the President. It is composed of four elected members and the President. The GC is the most important event of IAESTE each year. Here every country brings job offers they have obtained in their own country. Every job is written on a standardized form stating where and when the job is, who is eligible for the job and which qualifications (language, skills, etc.) are required. The jobs are traded during the Exchange Sessions. During these sessions, countries meet and try to get the best possible jobs to bring back home. This is very hectic as countries try to get the best jobs. These jobs either have to fit pre-selected students or are open for applications from students back home. One other notable event at the GC is the \\"International Party\\". At this party, every member country brings a national dish, drinks and clothes. The international work is funded by member fees based on GDP per capita and the number of students sent abroad and is paid by the National Committees. =National organization structure= The National Committees represent the member countries and are composed of persons representing academic, industrial and student interests. Every full member of the IAESTE has one vote at the GC. The National Secretary is normally the person with the formal vote, even though the decisions are often made by the whole National Committee. Each National Committee is responsible for the administration of the exchange in its own country. Membership is given after the establishment of a National Committee in accordance with the statutes of IAESTE, together with a responsible permanent secretariat. The type of secretariat which administers the exchange varies according to each country's national structure, educational system and funding policies. The essential requirement is that the national secretariat, whatever its organization and status, should have competent permanent staff. Every country has its own way of organizing the work of IAESTE, but the National Committee can mainly be classified into four categories: * Student- driven - The National Secretary is a student, normally serving for one to two years. Often there is one employed administrative staff for paperwork and keeping contact with other national committees, but the students are making decisions, organizing trainees and even raising funds. Examples are Norway, Denmark, Austria, Slovakia or Croatia. * Academically - The National Secretary is a professor or employed by a university to front IAESTE on the behalf of the university or the country. Usually, they have students to welcome trainees, but students are not involved in the decision-making. Examples are Turkey, Portugal. * Governmental - An employee of a governmental international work exchange organization is the National Secretary. Usually, the organization is responsible for several exchange programs and is quite professional. They also often employ students to welcome incoming students. Examples are Finland, Switzerland and UK. * Other - Non-profit organizations funded by various sources (students, companies, government) but not affiliated with a single institution. Examples are China, USA. IAESTE varies a lot from country to country and even within countries, there can be a big difference from one city to another. Traineeships also vary a lot: some countries have extended programmes with students employed to help and organize events,Example from Norway of the social part of being a trainee while in other places arriving trainees organize events themselves.

In 2010, FoIN was re-branded as the IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN) and an Alumni Relations Manager was appointed to oversee all activities. The current holder of this position is Bruce Wicks from the United Kingdom. In 2011, IAN launched a new, online network which currently has over 10,000 members. IAESTE Day In 2005, an international IAESTE Day was created, for the purpose of global promotion of the organization as well as the celebration of its aims and goals. Starting with 6 countries, IAESTE Day was celebrated in 28 of its member countries in 2007. IAESTE Day is held on 20 October every year. JUMP Join Us to Motivate People (JUMP) is the \\"Motivation and Training Seminar\\" of IAESTE. JUMP was founded in 1995 in Vienna, Austria on the initiative of Martin Klaus, former National Secretary of IAESTE Austria. Martin became co-ordinator of JUMP, later this role was taken over by Adrian Keller from IAESTE Switzerland and in 2009 by Tomasz (Tomek) Pawliszyn from IAESTE Poland. JUMP is aimed to young members of IAESTE who want to explore more the organisation and meet other members of IAESTE. Primarily new members of IAESTE meet in a different European city each year during four days in September or October for training sessions and discussion groups. An important component is cultural exchange with corporate tours, cultural events and tours and social events incorporating local cuisine and customs. The theme song for the seminar is Jump (For My Love) by the Pointer Sisters. Usually, 40 - 70 participants take part in the event. Each JUMP is combined of six workshop sessions, led by experienced members, that cover the essence of IAESTE activities: *Introduction to IAESTE *Administration *Company Marketing and Fundraising *Job-Raising *Local Committee Management *Student Marketing and Member-Raising Additionally, all participants visit various information boots on the topics of summer reception, career fairs, career websites, etc. All together combined with IAESTE related games, international evening, sightseeing trip and company presentation to show that IAESTE is much more than the exchange of job offers. One of the other highlights is motivation speeches by invited guests. Because of the global pandemic, the 2020 IAESTE JUMP Conference was virtual, hosted by IAESTE United States August 26-28, 2020. CEC The Central European Convention is a group of several IAESTE member countries in the specific geographic region. Those are all \\"student- run\\" countries, so students are in the decision making positions (contrary to academic or professional-run countries). Those countries agree to meet twice a year and hold working and discussion groups. At the same time, they get to know the culture of the hosting country. =Goals= * Motivation * Education * Developing IAESTE * Improve the situation of student-run countries =History= The Central European Convention (CEC) was founded in May 1998 in Tuheljske Toplice, Croatia, on the initiative of Thomas Haim, former National Secretary IAESTE AUSTRIA and Mario Kauzlaric, former National Secretary IAESTE CROATIA.

The title alludes to the common anime drawing style of characters with large expressive eyes and comparatively small mouths. Gameplay BESM uses a point-based character creation system. Players roll two 6-sided dice, add 10 to the total and then divide the resultant sum between Mind, Body, and Soul, against which all action checks are made. These are supplemented by Attributes, which can be positive (Acrobatics) or negative (Easily Distracted), giving the characters unique abilities. First edition The initial edition, designed by Mark C. MacKinnon, was released by Guardians of Order in 1997. Soon after that, RPG writer David L. Pulver began writing supplements for what was essentially a fairly simple game, adding a detailed system for the creation of mecha with his book Big Robots, Cool Starships. Skills were added with the next supplement, a genre book called Hot Rods & Gun Bunnies. At the same time MacKinnon and his colleagues were using BESM's system (now referred to as \\"the Tri-Stat System\\") as the basis for licensed games based on anime properties such as Sailor Moon, Dominion: Tank Police, Demon City Shinjuku and Tenchi Muyo! All of these innovations were incorporated into a second edition, which was released in 2001 to a very strong reception. The first edition was a slim, grey-covered book. A vast promotion and beta test was organized, and included a number of demo-team members from around the world. Since then, the other anime licenses that Guardians of Order obtained used the BESM system as their core rules. Instead of publishing complete games as they had done previously, the licensed books were published as \\"Ultimate Fan Guides\\". In addition, several genre based supplements were published for the game, as well as two original settings: Centauri Knights and Uresia: Grave of Heaven. =Reception= In the January 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue 243), Rick Swan dismissed BESM as \\"a stripped- down, entry-level RPG.\\" Swan pointed out that the rules were primarily focussed on character creation, \\"but that‚Äôs pretty much all you get. There‚Äôs little in the way of background material, campaign outlines, or staging tips, making this more of an introduction to roleplaying than a ready-to-play game.\\" He did not recommend the game, saying, \\"Hardcore anime might be better off investigating the Bubblegum Crisis game by R. Talsorian.\\" Two issues later, in the March 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue 245), Lester Smith gave an enthusiastic review, saying, \\"In a hobby where, all too often, games seem to be published without a clear vision of their topic or audience... BESM stands out as an example of a product that knows its subject and treats it right.\\" Smith's only criticism was weapon damage, pointing out that since there are no penalties for wielding the largest weapon dealing the most damage, why wouldn't everyone simply choose the largest weapon? He also warned that combat can drag on if both players have good defences. Smith concluded, \\"For fans of anime, then, I highly recommend the Big Eyes, Small Mouth RPG. It is just about perfect for what it sets out to accomplish. Even if you aren‚Äôt anime fan, I recommend that you give the game a look anyway. It might just introduce you to a whole new world of adventure.\\" d20 edition A version of BESM adapted to the d20 System was published in 2003. Sales were good but the critical response was mixed. New versions of Centauri Knights and Uresia were released under the new version. A later revised edition of this version was published in 2004, which, due to errors in the proofing and printing processes, did not contain the full set of revisions in its final published form. Company president Mark C. MacKinnon offered a public explanation and apology, and offered to refund buyers who were dissatisfied with their purchase of the book. BESM 3rd Edition The third edition of BESM was scheduled to be released in April 2006 after Mark C. MacKinnon had announced that the release would be delayed from its original release in the Summer of 2005. The third edition was at that time planned to come in three forms: BESM 3rd Edition (deluxe), BESM 3rd Edition (standard) and Vanilla BESM, an inexpensive and simplified variant created to introduce non-RP gamers. Mark MacKinnon announced that as of August 1, 2006, Guardians of Order was going out of business, and that \\"BESM Third Edition is finished and ready for press. Another company will be publishing it and providing future support. It's the most elegant version of BESM and the Tri-Stat System that I have put together and am very proud of it. If you pre-ordered the book from us, more information will follow.\\" On September 9, 2006, ArtHaus Games, whose titles are published by White Wolf Publishing, announced that it had acquired the RPG. The announcement stated that the company was \\"extremely confident\\" that a release date of January 2007 would be met, and confirmed that those who pre-ordered and prepaid for the book would be \\"in good hands\\", though they also stated that they had not taken on Guardians of Order's liabilities. BESM 3rd Edition was released by ArtHaus on January 24, 2007. The new edition featured a change in the Tri-Stat game mechanic from a \\"roll-under\\" to the \\"roll-over and hit a target number\\" found in other games. The book was standard 8.5 x 11 in format and featured full color interior art. The Deluxe Edition was not released, and ArtHaus did not announce any plans to follow up with further releases or the previously-announced Vanilla BESM.  BESM Fourth Edition  On April 29, 2019, Dyskami Publishing Company announced that they had entered into a worldwide licensing arrangement with White Wolf Entertainment to produce a new edition of BESM. The new edition was to be written and updated by its original designer (and Dyskami founder), Mark MacKinnon, and co-published with tabletop game publisher Japanime Games. In addition to the regular and deluxe BESM Fourth Edition, Dyskami also announced plans to publish a stripped-down core role-playing game called BESM Naked, that would be a complete, stand-alone, alternate edition that could fully integrate with BESM Fourth Edition but presented as a \\"gateway product\\". After a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, Dyskami Publishing Company released complete PDF files of multiple BESM Fourth Edition products to the product's backers on December 23rd, 2019, including the core and Naked RPGs, game screen, adventures, character folio, and sample characters. The BESM Fourth Edition product line was sent to the printer in January 2020 and had its worldwide consumer and retailer release in October 2020. To coincide with the digital BESM Fourth Edition launch, Dyskami Publishing Company also announced plans during the Kickstarter campaign to launch a community content PDF program on DriveThruRPG called Tri-Stat Emporium, whose name alludes to the Tri-Stat System generic role-playing game system used in all editions of BESM thus far. The Tri-Stat Emporium launched on June 8th, 2020. Ultimate Fan Guides Starting in 2001, Guardians of Order replaced the company's previous practice of producing stand-alone games for anime series for which they had obtained licenses with Ultimate Fan Guides -- a series of supplements for BESM which combine information on the episodes, characters and themes of anime series with statistics and game information for those series. The Ultimate Fan Guide series was controversial among BESM fans. Although the books were usually well put-together and almost always featured many full-color pages with stills from the series involved, many fans believed the information provided in certain guides was incomplete and unreliable. In addition, there were occasional editing errors that led to embarrassing omissions. Many anime series whose first RPG treatment was in the Ultimate Fan Guides series were also adapted to the d20 System edition of Big Eyes, Small Mouth. The Slayers guides were adapted into a stand-alone d20 game under the title The Slayers d20. Due to licensing consideration, the three-volume set of fan guides for Slayers does not include any information from the movies and OVAs distributed by ADV Films. This means that there has never been an official BESM writeup for Naga the Serpent, a popular character who does not appear in the television series.

Original craft, at Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace. The first mechanically powered submarine, the 1863 French submarine Plongeur, used a compressed-air engine. Mus√©e de la Marine (Rochefort). A pneumatic motor (air motor) or compressed air engine is a type of motor which does mechanical work by expanding compressed air. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion. Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor, piston air motor, air turbine or gear type motor. Pneumatic motors have existed in many forms over the past two centuries, ranging in size from hand-held motors to engines of up to several hundred horsepower. Some types rely on pistons and cylinders; others on slotted rotors with vanes (vane motors) and others use turbines. Many compressed air engines improve their performance by heating the incoming air or the engine itself. Pneumatic motors have found widespread success in the hand-held tool industry, but are also used stationary in a wide range of industrial applications. Continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry. However, pneumatic motors must overcome inefficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry. Classification =Linear= In order to achieve linear motion from compressed air, a system of pistons is most commonly used. The compressed air is fed into an air-tight chamber that houses the shaft of the piston. Also inside this chamber a spring is coiled around the shaft of the piston in order to hold the chamber completely open when air is not being pumped into the chamber. As air is fed into the chamber the force on the piston shaft begins to overcome the force being exerted on the spring.Engineers Edge. Pneumatic actuator design and operation. Retrieved from http://www.engineersedge.com/hydraulic/pneumatic_actuator.htm As more air is fed into the chamber, the pressure increases and the piston begins to move down the chamber. When it reaches its maximum length the air pressure is released from the chamber and the spring completes the cycle by closing off the chamber to return to its original position. Piston motors are the most commonly used in hydraulic systems. Essentially, piston motors are the same as hydraulic motors except they are used to convert hydraulic energy into mechanicalTechnology zone-air motor. Retrieved from energy.Vane-type motors. Retrieved from Piston motors are often used in series of two, three, four, five, or six cylinders that are enclosed in a housing. This allows for more power to be delivered by the pistons because several motors are in sync with each other at certain times of their cycle. =Rotary vane motors= A type of pneumatic motor, known as a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and the diameter of the housing. One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter. =Turbine motors= Air turbines spin the burr in high-speed dental handpieces, at speeds over 180,000 rpm, but with limited torque. A turbine is small enough to fit in the tip of a handpiece without adding to the weight. Application A widespread application of pneumatic motors is in hand-held tools, impact wrenches, pulse tools, screwdrivers, nut runners, drills, grinders, sanders and so on. Pneumatic motors are also used stationary in a wide range of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools. They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power Air motors. Retrieved from and do not create sparks. They can be loaded to stop with full torque without damages.Safety first and illustrated information on Historically, many individuals have tried to apply pneumatic motors to the transportation industry. Guy Negre, CEO and founder of Zero Pollution Motors, has pioneered this field since the late 1980s.Industrial concept. Retrieved from Recently Engineair has also developed a rotary motor for use in automobiles. Engineair places the motor immediately beside the wheel of the vehicle and uses no intermediate parts to transmit motion which means almost all of the motor's energy is used to rotate the wheel.Hall, K. (2009, May 26). Zero pollution motors plans 2011 u.s. launch for 106mpg air-powered car [Web log message]. Retrieved from History in transportation The pneumatic motor was first applied to the field of transportation in the mid-19th century. Though little is known about the first recorded compressed-air vehicle, it is said that the Frenchmen Andraud and Tessie of Motay ran a car powered by a pneumatic motor on a test track in Chaillot, France, on July 9, 1840. Although the car test was reported to have been successful, the pair didn‚Äôt explore further expansion of the design.The History of compressed air vehicles. (n.d.). Retrieved from The first successful application of the pneumatic motor in transportation was the Mekarski system air engine used in locomotives. Mekarski‚Äôs innovative engine overcame cooling that accompanies air expansion by heating air in a small boiler prior to use. The Tramway de Nantes, located in Nantes, France, was noted for being the first to use Mekarski engines to power their fleet of locomotives. The tramway began operation on December 13, 1879, and continues to operate today, although the pneumatic trams were replaced in 1917 by more efficient and modern electrical trams. American Charles Hodges also found success with pneumatic motors in the locomotive industry. In 1911 he designed a pneumatic locomotive and sold the patent to the H.K. Porter Company in Pittsburgh for use in coal mines.Hodges, C.B (1912). U.S. Patent No. 1024778. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Because pneumatic motors do not use combustion they were a much safer option in the coal industry. Many companies claim to be developing Compressed air cars, but none are actually available for purchase or even independent testing. Tools Impact wrenches, pulse tools, torque wrenches, screwdrivers, drills, grinders, die grinders, sanders, dental drills, tire changers and other pneumatic tools use a variety of air motors. These include vane type motors, turbines and piston motors. Torpedoes Most successful early forms of self-propelled torpedoes used high pressure compressed air, although this was superseded by internal or external combustion engines, steam engines, or electric motors. Railways Compressed air engines were used in trams and shunters, and eventually found a successful niche in mining locomotives, although in the end they were replaced by electric trains, underground. Over the years designs increased in complexity, resulting in a triple expansion engine with air-to-air reheaters between each stage. For more information see Fireless locomotive and Mekarski system.

Porter, Inc., in use at the Homestake Mine, South Dakota, between 1928 and 1961 Flight Transport category airplanes, such as commercial airliners, use compressed air starters to start the main engines. The air is supplied by the load compressor of the aircraft's auxiliary power unit, or by ground equipment. Water rockets use compressed air to power their water jet and generate thrust, they are used as toys. Air Hogs, a toy brand, also uses compressed air to power piston engines in toy airplanes (and some other toy vehicles). Automotive There is currently some interest in developing air cars. Several engines have been proposed for these, although none have demonstrated the performance and long life needed for personal transport. =Energine= The Energine Corporation was a South Korean company that claimed to deliver fully assembled cars running on a hybrid compressed air and electric engine. The compressed-air engine is used to activate an alternator, which extends the autonomous operating capacity of the car. The CEO was arrested for fraudulently promoting air motors with false claims.See Compressed air car#Energine =EngineAir= EngineAir, an Australian company, is making a rotary engine powered by compressed air, called The Di Pietro motor. The Di Pietro motor concept is based on a rotary piston. Different from existing rotary engines, the Di Pietro motor uses a simple cylindrical rotary piston (shaft driver) which rolls, with little friction, inside the cylindrical stator. It can be used in boat, cars, burden carriers and other vehicles. Only 1 psi (‚âà 6,8 kPa) of pressure is needed to overcome the friction. The engine was also featured on the ABC's New Inventors programme in Australia on 24 March 2004. =K'Airmobiles= K'Airmobiles vehicles were intended to be commercialized from a project developed in France in 2006-2007 by a small group of researchers. However, the project has not been able to gather the necessary funds. People should note that, meantime, the team has recognized the physical impossibility to use on-board stored compressed air due to its poor energy capacity and the thermal losses resulting from the expansion of the gas. These days, using the patent pending 'K'Air Generator', converted to work as a compressed-gas motor, the project should be launched in 2010, thanks to a North American group of investors, but for the purpose of developing first a green energy power system. =MDI= In the original N√®gre air engine, one piston compresses air from the atmosphere to mix with the stored compressed air (which will cool drastically as it expands). This mixture drives the second piston, providing the actual engine power. MDI's engine works with constant torque, and the only way to change the torque to the wheels is to use a pulley transmission of constant variation, losing some efficiency. When vehicle is stopped, MDI's engine had to be on and working, losing energy. In 2001-2004 MDI switched to a design similar to that described in Regusci's patents (see below), which date back to 1990. It has been reported in 2008 that Indian car manufacturer Tata was looking at an MDI compressed air engine as an option on its low priced Nano automobiles. Tata announced in 2009 that the compressed air car was proving difficult to develop due to its low range and problems with low engine temperatures. =Quasiturbine= The Pneumatic Quasiturbine engine is a compressed air pistonless rotary engine using a rhomboidal-shaped rotor whose sides are hinged at the vertices. The Quasiturbine has demonstrated as a pneumatic engine using stored compressed air Quasiturbine Low RPM High Torque Pressure Driven Turbine for Top Efficiency Power Modulation. Peers reviewed paper - Published in The Proceeding of Turbo Expo 2007 of the IGTI (International Gas Turbine Institute) and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).Abstract info It can also take advantage of the energy amplification possible from using available external heat, such as solar energy. The Quasiturbine rotates from pressure as low as 0.1 atm (1.47psi). Since the Quasiturbine is a pure expansion engine, while the Wankel and most other rotary engines are not, it is well-suited as a compressed fluid engine, air engine or air motor. =Regusci= Armando Regusci's version of the air engine couples the transmission system directly to the wheel, and has variable torque from zero to the maximum, enhancing efficiency. Regusci's patents date from 1990. = Team Psycho-Active = Psycho-Active is developing a multi- fuel/air-hybrid chassis which is intended to serve as the foundation for a line of automobiles. Claimed performance is 50 hp/litre. The compressed air motor they use is called the DBRE or Ducted Blade Rotary Engine. Defunct air engine designs =Conger motor= Milton M. Conger in 1881 patented and supposedly built a motor that ran off compressed air or steam that using a flexible tubing which will form a wedge-shaped or inclined wall or abutment in the rear of the tangential bearing of the wheel, and propel it with greater or less speed according to the pressure of the propelling medium.

It is a colorless liquid with a pleasant, buttery odor. It is chiral. The form produced by bacteria is (R)-acetoin.Albert Gossauer: Struktur und Reaktivit√§t der Biomolek√ºle, Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Z√ºrich, 2006, Seite 285, . Production in bacteria Acetoin is a neutral, four-carbon molecule used as an external energy store by a number of fermentative bacteria. It is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate, a common precursor in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Owing to its neutral nature, production and excretion of acetoin during exponential growth prevents over-acidification of the cytoplasm and the surrounding medium that would result from accumulation of acidic metabolic products, such as acetic acid and citric acid. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be used to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex, following a mechanism largely analogous to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; however, as acetoin is not a 2-oxoacid, it does not undergo decarboxylation by the E1 enzyme; instead, a molecule of acetaldehyde is released. In some bacteria, acetoin can also be reduced to 2,3-butanediol by acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase. The Voges-Proskauer test is a commonly used microbiological test for acetoin production. Uses =Food ingredients= Acetoin, along with diacetyl, is one of the compounds that gives butter its characteristic flavor.

The bombing killed more than 80 people and injured 200, almost all civilians. Three other car bombs also exploded in Beirut in 1985: on 22 May, 14 August and 18 August. The blast The bomb explosion, estimated to have been equivalent to 200 kg (440 lbs) of dynamite, occurred in the western Beirut suburb of Bir al-Abed, outside an apartment building. It killed worshippers, mostly women and girls, leaving Friday prayer services at an adjacent mosque, and destroyed two 7-story apartment buildings and a cinema. While several of Fadlallah's bodyguards were killed in the attack, the cleric escaped injury as he was attending Friday prayers at a nearby mosque. Locals fired guns in the air, following the blast, trying to clear the roads to allow ambulances to pass.

Terrorism Law: The Rule Of Law And The War On Terror. 2004, page 155. The Beirut car bombing occurred \\"within the continuously evolving framework of an American 'preemption' counterterror program\\". Following the 1983 United States embassy bombing and the 1984 U.S. embassy annex bombing, the U.S. military considered a range of retaliatory options, but it was unclear that these would have any deterrent value. On 14 November 1983, U.S.President Ronald Reagan authorized a retaliatory strike, but Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger did not authorize U.S. aircraft to take off for reasons that have not been disclosed. CIA director William Casey, along with CIA General Counsel Stanley Sporkin, favored the use of preemptive counter-terrorism practices in Lebanon; others, including Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John N. McMahon, did not approve of the strategy, concerned that it would violate Executive Order 12333. Responsibility The U.S. National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane, stated that those responsible for the bomb may have had American training, but asserted that they were \\"rogue operative[s],\\" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack. Woodward's own account of his conversation with Casey suggests that Casey's action was \\"off the books\\". A former CIA operative maintains that the failed 1985 attempt tarnished the CIA's reputation.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/10/qassem- suleimani-and-how-nations-decide-to-kill Other bombings A car bomb on 22 May killed 48 people.

It was adapted into a film of the same name starring Elijah Wood and Eugene H√ºtz in 2005. The book's writing and structure received critical acclaim for the manner in which it switches between two stories, both of which are autobiographical. One of them is the fictionalized history of the eradicated town of Trochenbrod (Trachimbrod), a real exclusively Jewish shtetl in Poland before the Holocaust where the author's grandfather was born; while the second narrative encompasses Foer's trip to Ukraine in search of the remnants and memories of Trachimbrod as well as the author's writing-in-progress. Historical background The real town of Trochenbrod was an exclusively Jewish shtetl located in Western Ukraine. After the German attack on the Soviet Union in the 1941, a Nazi ghetto was established at Trochenbrod for local residents including those from nearby villages. The ghetto was liquidated during the Holocaust. In August and September 1942, nearly all Jews of Trochenbrod were murdered by the German security troops with assistance from the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police who rounded up Jews. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Jews were murdered, including those from nearby Lozisht. Plot summary Jonathan Safran Foer (the author), a young American Jew, who is vegetarian and an avid collector of his family's heritage, journeys to Ukraine in search of Augustine, the woman who saved his grandfather's life during the Nazi liquidation of Trachimbrod, his family shtetl (a small town) in occupied eastern Poland. Armed with maps, cigarettes and many copies of an old photograph of Augustine and his grandfather, Jonathan begins his search with the help from Ukrainian native and soon-to-be good friend, Alexander \\"Alex\\" Perchov, who is Foer's age and very fond of American pop culture, albeit culture that is already out of date in the United States. Alexander studied English at his university, and even though his knowledge of the language is not \\"first-rate\\", he becomes Foer's translator. Alex's \\"blind\\" grandfather and his \\"deranged seeing-eye bitch,\\" Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr., accompany them on their journey. Interspersed throughout the book is the story that Jonathan Safran Foer (the character) learns about his ancestors‚Äînamely, his great-times-five-or-six grandmother Brod and his grandfather Safran. Brod has a magical, maybe-virgin birth, when she, as a baby, bobs to the surface after her father dies in a wagon accident in the river Brod, for which the baby is later named. A man named Yankel raises her until he dies. Literary significance and criticism Upon its initial release the book received enthusiastic reviews, particularly in The Times, which stated that Foer had \\"staked his claim for literary greatness.\\" However, Canadian historian Ivan Katchanovski in his article from The Prague Post online lamented that the book misrepresents the history of Jews in Ukraine and that the factual history of the massacre at Trachimbrod \\"stands in a sharp contrast to claims made in the book.\\"Katchanovski, Ivan.

A pneumatic tool, air tool, air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool is a type of power tool, driven by compressed air supplied by an air compressor. Pneumatic tools can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. Most pneumatic tools convert the compressed air to work using a pneumatic motor. Compared to electric power tool equivalents, pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain, without risk of sparks, short- circuiting or electrocution, and have a higher power to weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. Furthermore, they are less likely to self-destruct in case the tool is jammed or overloaded.S. R. Majumdar (1996). Pneumatic Systems: Principles and Maintenance. Tata McGraw- Hill Education. pp. 107‚Äì. . General grade pneumatic tools with a short life span are commonly less expensive and considered ‚Äúdisposable tools‚Äù in tooling industries, while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive. In general, pneumatic tools are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools. Regular lubrication of the tools is still needed however. Most pneumatic tools are to be supplied with compressed air at 4 to 6 bar.  Advantages and disadvantages  Pneumatic tools have many benefits which have contributed to their rise in popularity. The benefits of using compressed air to power tools are: * Inexpensive * Safe to use * Easy to operate * Portable * Low theft rates The primary disadvantage of pneumatic tools is the need for an air compressor, which can be expensive. Pneumatic tools also need to be properly maintained and oiled regularly. Failing to maintain tools can lead to deterioration, due to a build up residual oil and water.  Technical terms  Pneumatic tools are rated using several metrics: Free Speed (rpm), Air Pressure (psi/bar), Air Consumption (cfm/scfm or m3/min), Horse Power (hp), and spindle size. Each individual tool has its own specific requirements which determine their compatibility with air compressor systems. Flow or airflow, related to air consumption in pneumatic tools, represents the quantity of compressed air that passes through a section over a unit of time. It is represented in l/min, m3, at the equivalent value in free air in conditions of standard reference atmosphere (SRA). For example: +20 c, 65% of relative humidity, 1013 mbar, in accordance with norms NFE.  Types of pneumatic tools  Pneumatic tools come in many shapes and form, including small and large-sized hand tools.

Brabantian or Brabantish, also Brabantic or Brabantine (, Standard Dutch pronunciation: , ), is a dialect group of the Dutch language. It is named after the historical Duchy of Brabant, which corresponded mainly to the Dutch province of North Brabant, the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Flemish Brabant as well as the Brussels-Capital Region (where its native speakers have become a minority) and the province of Walloon Brabant. Brabantian expands into small parts in the west of Limburg, and its strong influence on the Flemish dialects in East Flanders weakens toward the west. In a small area in the northwest of North Brabant (Willemstad), Hollandic is spoken. Conventionally, the South Guelderish dialects are distinguished from Brabantian but for no objective reason other than geography. Because of the relatively-large area in which it is spoken, Brabantian can be roughly divided into three subdialects, all of which differ in some aspects: * West Brabantian is spoken in the area west of the river Donge, in the west of North Brabant (around the cities Breda, Roosendaal and Bergen op Zoom) and in the north and west of the Province of Antwerp in Belgium. * East Brabantian is spoken in the area east of the river Donge; in the middle and east of North Brabant (the area around the cities Tilburg, Eindhoven, 's-Hertogenbosch and Helmond), the east of the Province of Antwerp and the northwestern edge of the Dutch Province of Limburg (Netherlands). * South Brabantian is spoken in the province of Flemish Brabant and the south of Antwerp. Over 5 million people live in an area with some form of Brabantian being the predominant colloquial language out of the area's 22 million Dutch-speakers across Netherlands and Flanders.Belgium FOD economy Statbel official demographic statisticsNetherlands gouvernement CBS official demographic statistics History Compared to the other dialects and sublanguages of Dutch, Brabantian has historically had a major influence on the development of Dutch. During the Middle Ages, manuscripts from the 10th to 15th centuries show that Limburgish and then West Flemish were the predominant literary languages, but there is no evidence of literary manuscripts farther north. In the second half of the 14th century, emphasis in society shifted to Brabant and so the Brabantian dialect became dominant. A migration to the north was occurring; the West Flemish dialect influenced the coastal area of the province of South Holland ('s-Gravenhage and Leiden), and migrants from Brabant came to the provinces of North Holland and Utrecht. In the 16th century, when the Low Countries were in turmoil, another migration occurred from the Spanish Netherlands (roughly what is now Belgium) to the United Provinces of the Netherlands. That made the cultural elite move from the oppressive Spanish and Roman Catholic region to the more liberal (and Protestant) north. Dutch linguistics historian Nicoline van der Sijs says that it is a popular myth that Brabantian was a dominant influence during the standardisation of Dutch from the 16th century. She says that Standard Dutch is a standardised Hollandic dialect. However, researchers of variance linguistics at the University of GentBrabants and Dutch linguists in Berlinnederlands in vlaanderen recognise the distinctive influence of Brabantian on the first Dutch standardisation in the 16th century. The first major formation of Standard Dutch also took place in Antwerp, where a Brabantian dialect is still spoken. That made the standard language develop mainly from Brabantian influence. Current use =Netherlands= The early modern Dutch written language was initially influenced primarily by Brabantian, with strong influence from the Hollandic dialect after the 16th century. Since then, it has diverged from Standard Dutch and evolved its own way, but it is still similar enough for both to be mutually intelligible. Berlin scientists point to a very important phenomenon in the 20th century in the south of the Dutch language area: there has been an expansion in the use of Brabantian by the dominant presence of native Brabantian-speakers in the modern mass media like radio and television. About one quarter of the Dutch- speaking population lives in the Brabantian dialect zone. In the Netherlands, rural areas still retain some of their original Brabantian dialects. In large Dutch cities, such as Breda and Eindhoven, where the Industrial Revolution drew many people from other parts of the country, the dialect has been diluted by contact with Standard Dutch. Because people tended to migrate towards the cities from the surrounding rural areas, Brabantian influence is still seen in some terms and in pronunciation (the \\"Brabantian accent\\" of Dutch), but the original Brabantian city dialects have largely disappeared there. However, some large cities, such as Tilburg and 's-Hertogenbosch, still have many people speaking the original Brabantian dialect. =Belgium= In Belgium, dialects are still the common spoken language and are still spoken in most large cities, particularly in Antwerp, where Antwerpian, a dialect in the city that is rather distinct from that of the surrounding area, remains common. In Brussels-Capital Region, French largely replaced Dutch in the mid-20th century, but there are many cultural activities that use the Brussels dialect (sometimes called Marols), such as the Mass in a church in Jette. Moreover, the use of Dutch is reviving because of young Dutch-speaking families moving back from the suburbs to the old city centre, the City of Brussels. The comic artist Herg√© based fictional languages like Syldavian in his childhood Marols. Differences from Standard Dutch Brabantian is rather close to and contributed to the development of Standard Dutch. A characteristic phrase, houdoe (\\"take care\\"), derives from houd u goed (literally, \\"keep yourself all right\\"), but colloquial Dutch and Hollandic use doei (\\"bye\\"). In South Brabantian (Belgium), \\"Ale, salu(kes) e!\\", a calque from French \\"Allez!\\" and \\"Salut!\\", is a common greeting. Brabantian dialects have a characteristic historic tendency toward accusativism, the use of the accusative case instead of the nominative case. While the cases themselves have fallen out of use in modern language, the accusative form survives in Brabantian, rather than the nominative case of the more northern dialects (nominativism). As the accusative case had different forms for masculine and feminine nouns, both genders have thus remained separate in Brabantian. Standardisation The first attempts at standardising Dutch were in the 1540s and based on the Brabantian dialect of Antwerp and its surroundings. However, after the Dutch Revolt, the Dutch economical and political focus shifted north to centre on the County of Holland, which dwindled the importance of Brabantian. Later attempts to establish a standard form of Brabantian have met little success. However, the new phenomenon of tussentaal is becoming widespread.

She was completed in 1976 as Cunard Countess for Cunard Line and was a popular ship in the Caribbean cruise market for 20 years. After leaving Cunard service in 1996, she had a number of owners before being purchased by Majestic in 2004. She was retired in 2012 and scrapped in 2014 after a fire destroyed the ship. History Cunard Countess was built in Denmark in 1974-75 and initially registered in Southampton, England. The vessel was fitted-out at the INMA shipyard at La Spezia, Italy, from where trials were conducted and the vessel completed in July 1976. The ship proceeded to her Caribbean sea base port of San Juan, Puerto Rico, via Barcelona, Spain and Antigua. A part-ship charter group of passengers was carried on this maiden voyage, between Barcelona and Antigua. On the eve of entering full commercial service in August 1976, Cunard Countess was christened at San Juan by Janet Armstrong, then wife of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. Cunard Countess docked in Martinique, 1982 The '4-star-Premium' style Cunard Countess, with her almost-identical sister ship Cunard Princess of 1977, became popular with the North American and British/European market, particularly for their contemporary facilities and variety entertainment. They were well known for their cruises in the Caribbean and middle Atlantic Ocean, becoming a staple at the San Juan ship dock and later at Miami, Santo Domingo and many other places around the area. Cunard Countess was notably one of the few ships to regularly visit the Caribbean island of Grenada during the revolutionary period of that island (1979‚Äì1983) and thus played a major role in supporting the local tourist industry during those years. Two of Cunard Countesss competitors in the Caribbean during the late 1970s-1980s were the much older but also very popular and Carla C, all three being of similar dimensions and capacity (recently built cruise ships are generally far larger). Other contemporary ships in this market were the P&O;/Princess Cruises' Sun Princess and Island Princess, both also having similar dimensions and capacity to Cunard Countess. In October 1982, after the conclusion of the Falklands War, the ship was chartered for six months by the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) to support troop movements between Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands while Port Stanley Airport was being reinstated. Families and friends of British personnel lost in the conflict were also carried on one round voyage, to enable commemorations both at sea and ashore. At the end of the charter, Cunard controversially awarded the contract for the refurbishment of the vessel to Malta Shipyards at a reported cost of ¬£2 million. Cunard Countess returned to Caribbean cruising in July 1983. In 1990 the ship's port of registry was changed to Nassau, The Bahamas. In 1996 - before Carnival‚Äôs buy-out of Cunard Line in 1998 - Cunard Countess was sold to Awani Cruises and renamed Awani Dream II, to cruise along with the original Awani Dream. The Awani cruise company ran into financial trouble and in 1998 the ship moved to Royal Olympic Cruises, as Olympic Countess under the Greek flag. Ocean Countess anchored off Santorini, July 2008. Purchased in 2004 by Maximus Navigation Ltd, a subsidiary of Majestic International Cruises, she was renamed Ocean Countess and registered in Madeira on the International Shipping Register of Portugal. She was chartered as Ruby to Louis Cruise Lines in May 2007, resuming the name Ocean Countess in December of that year. During this employment, cruises usually departed from Piraeus, visiting destinations like Mykonos, Patmos, Crete and Santorini in Greece as well as Kusadasi in Turkey. During 2009 the ship was leased by the Spanish operator Quail Cruises for a series of Mediterranean cruises from Valencia. Olympic Countess off of Mozambique in December 2002 In April 2010, the refitted Ocean Countess joined Marco Polo in an extensive cruise programme from British ports for the recently formed company Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV). In late 2012 Ocean Countess left the CMV fleet, with a final 13-night Canary Islands & Madeira ‚ÄúFarewell Voyage‚Äù which ended in Barcelona instead of returning to Liverpool; she was replaced by the MV Discovery. On 30 November 2013 the central superstructure of the ship caught fire at Chalkis, Greece while laid up prior to an anticipated return to service in 2014. The five caretaker crew were all accounted for. She sustained heavy damage from waterline to funnel. She has been sold to a scrapyard in Aliaga and departed Chalkis under tow on 7 March 2014. Facilities The fully air-conditioned Ocean Countess had 7 passenger decks (passenger decks 3 to 7, 9 and sun terrace deck 10) plus three further crew-only decks (decks 1, 2 and bridge deck 8). There were deluxe cabins and suites as well as inner and outer standard cabins. All cabins featured private facilities. Passenger capacity was approximately 800 in 400 cabins with a crew of 350. A small number of cabins could be adjusted for guests with special requirements. The sun terrace (top deck), exterior boat deck and aft lido deck were sheathed in traditional teak. The accommodation, public rooms and decks were refurbished and renamed with British themes in early 2010, in preparation for Ocean Countess' charter to Cruise & Maritime Voyages. New flat screen televisions with satellite channels were also installed in all cabins as part of the refurbishment.

He served as senior Daily Book Reviewer from 1969 to 1995. Biography Lehmann-Haupt was born on June 14, 1934 in Edinburgh, Scotland, while his parents were visiting his mother's family. He was the eldest of three sons of Leticia Jane Hargrave Grierson, a Scottish teacher and editor from Edinburgh, and Hellmut Otto Emil Lehmann-Haupt, a German-born graphic arts historian and bibliographer. His family lived in New York City. Christopher had two younger brothers, Carl and Alexander. It was not until Lehmann-Haupt traveled to Berlin in 1947 to live with his father for a year that he learned about his father's Jewish ancestry. His parents had divorced, and his father had gone to Berlin in 1946 with the Allied Armies‚Äô Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section to help recover art works stolen by the Nazis and to revive German cultural life. In 1948 his father married again, to Rosemarie Mueller. They had two children, John and Roxana Lehmann-Haupt, half- siblings to Christopher and his brothers. Lehmann-Haupt was educated at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York, The Putney School in Vermont, and Swarthmore College.[https://www.putneyschool.org/content/christopher- lehmann-haupt-52 He did postgraduate work at the Yale School of Drama, from which he graduated in 1959 with a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater history and dramatic criticism. Editing Lehmann-Haupt first worked as a teacher in Middletown, New York, but moved to Manhattan to seek work in publishing. He worked as an editor for various New York City publishing houses, among them Holt, Rinehart and Winston and The Dial Press. In 1965, he moved to The New York Times Book Review, where he became an editor and critic. He became immersed in the books and issues of the day. In May 1968, along with several dozen then-prominent writers and political activists (including James Baldwin, Jules Feiffer, Norman Mailer, Susan Sontag and Gloria Steinem), Lehmann-Haupt signed the \\"Violence in Oakland\\" essay published in the New York Review of Books. It condemned police harassment of and violence against Black Panther Party members in Oakland, California. A police attack on April 6, 1968, had resulted in their killing 17-year-old Bobby Hutton, and wounding leaders Eldridge Cleaver and another young African-American man. Each of the three was unarmed.\\"Violence in Oakland\\", New York Review of Books, 9 May 1968 In 1969, Lehmann-Haupt was appointed senior Daily Book Reviewer for The New York Times.

He wrote articles on a variety of subjects, including fly fishing and bluegrass banjo-picking, two of his occasional avocations. He also published three books of his own, which were well-reviewed. The first, a memoir, Me and Joe DiMaggio: A Baseball Fan Goes in Search of His Gods, was published in 1986 by Simon & Schuster. His first novel, A Crooked Man, was published by Simon & Schuster in 1995. His second novel, The Mad Cook of Pymatuning was published by Simon & Schuster in 2005. At the time of his death, Lehmann-Haupt was working on a memoir of the year he spent living in Berlin with his father, from 1947 until 1948. While editor of The New York Times Book Review, Lehmann-Haupt was known for being opposed to genre fiction. In 1980, when given a copy of Harlan Ellison's Shatterday for possible review, Lehmann-Haupt reportedly threw the book across the room and said, \\"Oh, it's that sci-fi crap.\\"A Lit Fuse: The Provocative Life of Harlan Ellison by Nat Segaloff, NESFA Press, 2017, page 132.

She co-founded the Voluntary Parenthood League, served in the National American Women's Suffrage Association, co-founded the Twilight Sleep Association, and wrote a famous pamphlet on sex education and birth control.  Biography  =Early life= Mary Coffin Ware was the second child of four born to George and Vonie Ware. As a child, Mary was precocious, talkative, and assertive, \\"scolding [her older brother] for striking her, often quoting the Bible.\\" At age 10, her father died of cancer. Her mother supported the family by organizing European tours for young women. While her mother was away, Mary and her siblings often lived with their Aunt Lucia Ames Mead, a prominent social reformer. Mary enrolled in the School of Art and Design in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1891 and graduated with first honors, then took a teaching position at the Drexel Institute of Art in Philadelphia in 1894. =Marriage and children= Mary Coffin Ware married William Hartley Dennett, an architect, in 1900. They shared the ideal of the Arts and Crafts movement and shortly thereafter bought a farmhouse in Framingham. Together, they founded an architectural and interior design firm. In addition her work as an interior designer and guadamacile maker, Mary Dennett continued to lecture and write about the Arts and Crafts movement. The Dennetts‚Äô first child was born in December 1900, after a difficult labor that nearly killed Mary. After another difficult labor, their second child was born in 1903 and died 3 weeks later. A third child was born in 1905, again after a difficult labor. This time the doctor told the Dennetts that they should not have any more children, but did not give them any information on birth control. Later Dennett wrote of their lack of information on birth control: =Divorce and notoriety= In 1904, Mary's husband Hartley Dennett began work on a house for a married couple, Dr. Heman Lincoln Chase and Margaret Chase. Eventually, Hartley Dennett and Margaret Chase developed an extremely close relationship, culminating in Hartley Dennett moving out of his and Mary's house in 1909. Concerned about the effect Hartley was having on their children, Mary Dennett filed for divorce in 1912, at the time an unusual and scandalous action. The Dennetts' divorce proceedings were a popular topic in the local newspapers, to Mary Dennett's great discomfort. =Career as women's rights advocate= Motivated by both a desire to escape the unpleasant realities of her life as well as Hartley Dennett's refusal to financially support his children, Mary Dennett returned to working outside the home, but not in her previous career as an artist and interior designer. In 1908, Dennett accepted the position of field secretary of the Massachusetts Women‚Äôs Suffrage Association, beginning a long career in public advocacy for women's rights. Dennett worked for the cause of women's suffrage from 1910 to 1914, a period that marked the revival of the women's suffrage movement, which had stagnated during the previous decade. After several years of work for the National American Women's Suffrage Association, she became disillusioned with the organization and resigned from her position. Dennett co-founded the Twilight Sleep Association 1913, which advocated the use of scopolamine and morphine to allow women to have painless childbirth. Statistics showed that twilight sleep reduced infant mortality and the risk of injury and infection, due to reduced use of forceps. She served as acting president until 1914, then as vice president. When world war broke out in 1914, Dennett to join the Women's Peace Party, an anti-war movement. In 1916, she served as field secretary for the American Union against Militarism, organizing meetings in several large cities. Dennett's work to re-elect Woodrow Wilson (under the belief that he would not declare war) led to a respected job as executive secretary for the League for Progressive Democracy. She resigned after Wilson declared war in 1917. She next co-founded and was employed by the People's Council of America, a socialist peace movement inspired by the Bolsheviks. In 1915, Dennett's name was again in the newspapers, against her wishes. Her ex-husband Hartley Dennett, his partner Margaret Chase, and her husband Dr. Chase extended a public invitation to Mary Dennett to, as one newspaper put it, \\"adopt the creed of harmonious love and form a quadrangle\\" with the three of them. Dennett feared the negative effect that her involuntary notoriety might have on the organizations she worked with and considered resigning from the Twilight Sleep Association. In 1914, Dennett met Margaret Sanger, a birth control advocate. Dennett was intrigued, but did not feel financially secure enough to join the birth control movement at the time. In 1915, Dennett wrote a sex education pamphlet for her children, as the result of the lack of any existing educational material that met her standards, which included scientific correctness, sex-positivity, and discussion of the emotional side of sexual relationships. The arrest of William Sanger in 1915 for distributing Margaret Sanger's birth control pamphlet catalyzed the birth control movement in the United States, and this time Dennett decided to get involved. Dennett co-founded The National Birth Control League in 1915 with Jesse Ashley and Clara Gruening Stillman. In 1918, she became the NBCL's executive secretary and started a campaign to make birth control information legal, giving lectures and lobbying state legislatures to change the laws. During this time, her pamphlet on sex education, \\"The Sex Side of Life,\\" was published. Later, as the NBCL faltered, she resigned as executive secretary and founded a new organization, the Voluntary Parenthood League, which focused on repealing anti-birth control information laws at the federal level. In 1929, Dennett was arrested for her work with sex education, women's rights, and birth control. Many people felt that her work was obscene and she should be imprisoned or fined. \\"Mary Dennett sounded defiant, proclaiming she would pay no fine, however small: 'If a few federal officials want to use their power to penalize me for my work for the young people of this country, they must bear the shame of a jail sentence. It is government which is disgraced, not I.\\" Dennet was proud of her work in sexual education and wanted it to last. Craig, John M. ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Sex Side of Life‚Äô: The Obscenity Case of Mary Ware Dennett.‚Äù Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, vol. 15, no. 3, 1995, pp. 145‚Äì166. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3346796.  Women's suffrage  Dennett did not become active in the women's suffrage movement until her marriage began to break up. Later, she wrote, \\"I went into suffrage work, as perhaps you know, because I needed an anaesthetic at the time, and suffrage was the nearest thing at hand that was unconnected with my previous work.\\" Dennett began her work as field secretary of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association, organizing lectures, rallies, sermons, cheap meals, speaking tours to gather signatures for petitions, and similar outreach efforts. Dennett's opinion on why women deserved the vote was simple: \\"Our basic principles that 'governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed' [...] undeniably imply the right of women to direct representation by the vote, since women are governed and women are people.\\" In 1910, Dennett's success in Massachusetts led the National American Woman Suffrage Association to aggressively recruit her for the position of Corresponding Secretary, reporting to Dr. Anna Howard Shaw. At the time, the NAWSA was ineffective and riven by factional conflict, which many blamed on Dr. Shaw's leadership. Taking the job required Mary to move from Boston to New York City, a hardship for her since she couldn't afford to move her children with her. Dennett successfully resolved much of the internal conflict in NAWSA within a few months, while supporting Dr. Shaw. Many prominent NAWSA members credited Dennett with reuniting the NAWSA membership and turning the organization around. In 1910, Washington State granted women the right to vote, the first state to do so in 14 years. Later, Dennett became disillusioned with NAWSA after an unsuccessful attempt to reorganize to be more effective and what she saw as wasteful decisions overly influenced by wealthy donors. She resigned her position at NAWSA in 1914.  Birth control movement  After William Sanger's arrest for distributing birth control information inspired a resurgence in the American birth control movement, Dennett co-founded The National Birth Control League in 1915 with Jesse Ashley and Clara Gruening Stillman. Dennett decided to start by rallying public support to strike down laws restricting birth control information. Later, as the NBCL faltered, she resigned as executive secretary and founded a new organization, the Voluntary Parenthood League. She used methods like lobbying and lectures to promote the cause. =Fight for \\"straight repeal\\" to allow birth control information= Beginning in 1919, Dennett focused on a \\"straight repeal\\" of the birth control provisions of the Comstock Act at the federal level, rather than state-by-state efforts. She lobbied Congress to simply remove the words \\"prevention of conception\\" from federal obscenity statutes. Dennett repeatedly lobbied individual senators in person for a year before she found one willing to sponsor the bill, Senator H. Heisler Ball, a former practicing physician. However, he never introduced the bill. In 1921, Dennett changed her approach and decided to work directly with the postmaster general, whose responsibility it was to enforce the laws banning distribution of birth control information through the mails (although in practice this was not enforced). Postmaster General William Hayes seemed sympathetic, but resigned before taking any action. His replacement, Dr. Hubert Work, was adamantly opposed to birth control information, earlier stating that his opinions on birth control could be summarized as \\"sterilize all boys and girls who are unfit to become parents, and then let nature take its course unhindered.\\" Dennett returned to lobbying Congress in 1922, pointing out that private opinion of members of congress must be in favor of birth control since the average number of children of a member of congress was 2.7. She continued to have difficulty finding sponsors for the bill, but in 1923 finally succeeded, when Senator Albert B. Cummins introduced the straight repeal bill in the Senate. However, the bill made no further progress during that session, since Cummins was unable to succeed in getting the rest of the Senate to vote on it due to mass absenteeism when it came up for a vote. In the next session of Congress, Representative William N. Vaile sponsored the bill in the House of Representatives. However, it was also stalled continually and never came to a vote. In addition, Margaret Sanger and her organization lobbied in favor of a version of the bill that would allow birth control information to doctors only, and lobbied against the \\"straight repeal\\" bill. In 1925, Dennett gave up on passing the \\"straight repeal\\" bill and retired from her position at the VPL. Dennett achieved her goal in an entirely different manner in 1930, by winning an appeal of her conviction for distribution of birth control information under the Comstock Act.  Sex education pamphlet and trial under the Comstock Act  Mary Ware Dennett captured the attention of the public and media for her sex education pamphlet, ‚ÄúThe Sex Side of Life.‚Äù Dennett wrote it in 1915 to educate her sons, because she was unable to find any adequate books on the subject. Many of the books on sex either contained inaccurate information or used fear and shame tactics to dissuade the youth from having sex. Therefore, she decided to write her own explanation using research and interviews with doctors. She passed the writing on to her friends with adolescent children. In 1918, it was published in Medical Review of Reviews, and a year later it was published as a pamphlet. The pamphlet was twenty-four pages long. Dennett used scientific discussion of sex while also including the emotion side of sex relations. The pamphlet covered controversial topics including masturbation, sexually transmitted diseases, prostitution, and support for the use of birth control. Her views were considered radical for this time, because she was not promoting abstinence. After fours years of being in circulation, the Post Office informed Dennett that the pamphlet was obscene, and therefore it was banned from being mailed under the Comstock Act. She continued to mail out the pamphlet after the Post Office ignored her inquiries of what parts of the pamphlet were obscene. In 1928, she was indicted under the Comstock law for distributing her pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which explained human reproduction to adolescents. H. L. Mencken observed the proceedings. He had briefly praised Mrs. Dennett‚Äôs book H. L. Mencken, ‚ÄúThe Literature of Sex,‚Äù The American Mercury, v. 8, no. 29 (May 1926) 127. in the May 1926 issue of The American Mercury, and took a sympathetic interest in her later legal troubles: Eventually a safe jury was empanelled by the prosecution ‚Äúand Mrs. Dennett was quickly convicted, and Judge Burrows fined her $300. The jury was composed entirely of \\"middle-aged family men\\".

Six months later the Circuit Court of Appeals, consisting of [Thomas Walker?] Swan, Augustus Noble Hand and Chase, JJ, set aside the verdict, decided that the pamphlet was so obviously not obscene that ‚Äòno case was made for submission to the jury,‚Äô and ordered Mrs. Dennett released from her bond.‚Äù H.L.

When the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned her conviction in 1930, the Court set a legal precedent that took intent into account in the evaluation of obscenity. Dennett's trial was part of a series of rulings that culminated in the 1936 ruling in United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries, which exempted birth control information and materials used by physicians from obscenity laws.

The vast size of the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre saw interconnected naval, land, and air campaigns fought for control of the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Southern Europe. The fighting in this theatre lasted from 10 June 1940, when Italy entered the war on the side of Germany, until 2 May 1945 when all Axis forces in Italy surrendered. However, fighting would continue in Greece ‚Äì where British troops had been dispatched to aid the Greek government ‚Äì during the early stages of the Greek Civil War. The British referred to this theatre as the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre (so called due to the location of the fighting and the name of Middle East Command), the Americans called it the Mediterranean Theater of War and the German informal official history of the fighting is The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939‚Äì1941 (1995). Regardless of the size of the theatre, the various campaigns were not seen as neatly separated areas of operations but part of a vast theatre of war. Fascist Italy aimed to carve out a new Roman Empire, while British forces aimed initially to retain the status quo. Italy invaded Greece, and not until the introduction of German forces were Greece and Yugoslavia overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union. In three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. The anti-Axis coalition then commenced the Allied invasion of Italy, resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies. A prolonged battle for Italy took place between Allied and Axis forces. As the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece. The theatre of war had the longest duration of the Second World War, resulted in the destruction of the Italian Empire and severely undermined the strategic position of Germany, resulting in German divisions being deployed to Africa and Italy and total German losses (including those captured upon final surrender) being over two million. Italian losses amounted to around 177,000 men with a further several hundred thousand captured during the process of the various campaigns. British losses amount to over 300,000 men killed, wounded, or captured, and total American losses in the region amounted to 130,000.  Background  = Italy = The ambitions of Fascist Italy in Europe in 1936. During the late 1920s, Benito Mussolini claimed that Italy needed an outlet for its \\"surplus population\\" and that it would be in other countries' best interests to aid in this expansion.Smith, p. 170 The regime wanted \\"hegemony in the Mediterranean‚ÄìDanubian‚ÄìBalkan region\\" and the gaining of world power by the conquest \\"of an empire stretching from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Strait of Hormuz\\".Martel, p. 184, 198 The Fascists had designs on Albania, Dalmatia, large parts of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Greece and harked back to the Roman empire. The regime also sought to establish protectorates with Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 467 Covert motives were for Italy to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean, capable of challenging France or Britain and gaining access to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. On 30 November 1938, Mussolini addressed the Fascist Grand Council on the goal of capturing Albania, Tunisia, Corsica, the Ticino canton of Switzerland and \\"French territory east of the River Var (to include Nice, but not Savoy)\\".Bell, p. 72 Mussolini alleged that Italy required uncontested access to the oceans and shipping lanes to ensure its national sovereignty.Salerno, pp. 105‚Äì106 Italy was a \\"prisoner in the Mediterranean\\" and had to break the chains of British and French control. Corsica, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Malta, Suez and Tunisia would need to be taken and Egypt, France, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom had to be challenged.Bell, pp. 72‚Äì73 Through armed conquest, the north and east African colonies would be linked and this 'prison' destroyed.Mallet, p. 9 Italy would be able to march \\"either to the Indian Ocean through the Sudan and Abyssinia, or to the Atlantic by way of French North Africa\\". On 2 October 1935, the Second Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War began when Italian forces invaded Abyssinia.Playfair (1954), p. 21 Mussolini lauded the conquest as a new source of raw materials and location for emigration and speculated that a native army could be raised there to \\"help conquer the Sudan.Bell, p. 70 \\"Almost as soon as the Abyssinian campaign ended, Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War\\" began.Beevor (2006). pp. 135‚Äì6. On 7 April 1939, Mussolini began the Italian invasion of Albania and within two days had occupied the country.Playfair (1954), p. 24 In May 1939, Italy formally allied to Nazi Germany in the Pact of Steel.Weinberg, p. 73 Italian foreign policy went through two stages during the Fascist regime. Until 1934‚Äì35, Mussolini followed a \\"modest ... and responsible\\" course and following that date there was \\"ceaseless activity and aggression\\".Bell, p. 76 \\"Prior to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, Mussolini had made military agreements with the French and formed a coalition with the British and French to prevent German aggression in Europe.\\" The Ethiopian War \\"exposed vulnerabilities and created opportunities that Mussolini seized to realise his imperial vision\\"Martel, pp. 178, 198 = Britain = Middle East Command At the Nyon Conference of 1937, Italy and the United Kingdom \\"disclaimed any desire to modify or see modified the national sovereignty of any country in the Mediterranean area, and agreed to discourage any activities liable to impair mutual relations.\\"Playfair (1954), p. 7 Italian diplomatic and military moves did not reflect this agreement.Playfair (1954), p. 8 In the aftermath of the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, British and Italian forces in North Africa were reinforced.Fraser, pp. 18‚Äì19 Due to various Italian moves, in July 1937, the British decided \\"that Italy could not now be regarded as a reliable friend\\" and preparations began to bring \\"the defences of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea ports up-to- date\\". In 1938, a weak armoured division was established in Egypt and further army and air force reinforcements were dispatched from Britain.Playfair (1954), p. 12 With rising tension in Europe, in June 1939, the United Kingdom established Middle East Command (MEC) in Cairo to provide centralised command for British army units in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre.Playfair (1954), pp. 31‚Äì32, 459 All three branches of the British military were made equally responsible for the defence of the area.Playfair (1954), p. 33 The authority of MEC included Aden, British Somaliland, Cyprus, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Greece, Libya, Palestine, Iraq, Sudan, Tanganyika, Transjordan, Uganda and the shores of the Persian Gulf.Playfair (1954), pp. 31, 457Bilgin, p.74Fraser, p. 114 If necessary, command would be exerted as far away as the Caucasus and the Indian Ocean. The purpose of the command was to be \\"the western bastion of defence of India\\", keep British supply lines open to India and the Far East, and keep the Middle Eastern oilfields out of Axis hands. Upon the establishment of MEC, it was ordered to co-ordinate with the French military in the Middle East and Africa as well as liaise with the Turkish General Staff and possibly the Greek General Staff.Playfair (1954), p. 458 On 19 October 1939, the Treaty of Mutual Assistance was signed between the United Kingdom, France and Turkey and British military forces were authorised to begin discussions with the Turkish general staff; a further conference was held during March 1940.Playfair, pp. 51, 53 Within a week of the Italian occupation of Albania, France and the United Kingdom \\"announced they had promised to give all the help in their power if Greek and Romanian independence were threatened and if the Greek Government or Romanian Government considered it vital to resist.\\"Playfair (1954), pp. 24‚Äì25 British forces in the Middle East were ordered to avoid provocation.Playfair (1954), p. 41 Following the defeat of Poland, the threat of an Axis attack from the Balkans against British positions in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean region increased.Playfair, pp. 48‚Äì49 In late 1939, with the assumption that Britain would soon be at war with Italy, planning began for attacks to capture Bardia and Jaghbub (Giarabub) in Libya and arrangements began in Egypt, to accommodate a much larger force.Playfair (1954), p. 54 Preparations to reinforce the Iraqi army were made and Palestinian security forces were to be reduced to the minimum. British forces in East Africa were to study operations to destroy the Italian forces and support local risings, all in support of the main Allied offensive, which was planned to be launched from French Somaliland. Troops in Sudan were also asked to consider launching operations against Kufra in southern Libya.Playfair (1954) p. 53  Initial military operations  On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom and next day the British Commonwealth declared war on Italy.Playfair (1954), p. 100 The fleets of Italy, France and the United Kingdom began the hostilities of the Battle of the Mediterranean.Playfair (1954), p. 109 The siege of Malta soon began, with first Italian air attack on 11 June.Wragg, p. 228. In the Western Desert, Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft attacked Italian positions inside Libya.Playfair (1954), p. 112 On 11 June, the Western Desert Campaign began, as the British launched minor raids and conducted patrols along the Libyan‚ÄìEgyptian border and on 17 June, Fort Capuzzo was captured.Playfair (1954), p. 118Overy, pp. 56‚Äì57 On 20 June, Mussolini began the Italian invasion of France, just before the end of the Battle of France.Jowett, p. 5. During June, the East African Campaign began with Italian attacks in East Africa, although ground combat did not start until July. The demarcation of France, following the two armistices coming into effect on 25 June. On 22 June, France signed an armistice at Compiegne with Germany and on 24 June, the Franco-Italian Armistice was signed.Bell, p. 306 Italy gained a demilitarised zone inside France (as well as similar zones where Italian and French colonies met).Bulletin of International News, pp. 852‚Äì854 Italian occupation forces took over an area of France, which included 28,500 people and the town of Menton.Rodogno, p. 9Maier, p. 311 The Royal Navy attacked the French fleet in the North African port of Mers-el-K√©bir on 3 July 1940, after it refused to sail to Britain or the French West Indies and demobilise, as part of a larger plan to stop the French fleet from falling into German or Italian hands.Weinberg, pp. 145‚Äì146. When Italy entered the war, there were no plans for an invasion of Egypt while France was still able to resist. When France surrendered, Mussolini gave instructions for his generals to prepare an offensive.Playfair (1954), p. 207 On 10 August, he instructed his forces to be prepared to attack in conjunction with the German invasion of the United Kingdom. While his generals did not believe they were prepared, they were ordered to push forward without any solid objectives.Macksey, p. 35 On 9 September, Italian aircraft start preparation bombardments for the invasion of Egypt. Four days later, Italian infantry attacked and advanced as far as Sidi Barrani before digging in, west of the main British position at Mersa Matruh.Playfair (1954), pp. 209‚Äì210 In East Africa, after some initial offensive actions, the Italian conquest of British Somaliland began in August and annexed the colony.Carol, p. 12. After crossing the Albanian border, Italian forces began the Greco-Italian War by invading Greece on 28 October. The Greek army repulsed the Italian attack and commenced a counter-offensive on 14 November, which pushed Italian forces back into Albania.Weinberg, p. 210. The Royal Navy inflicted a major setback upon the Italian Royal Navy during the Battle of Taranto on the night of 12/13 November. After assembling enough forces the British launched a counter-attack upon the Italians in Egypt. Operation Compass drove the Italians out of Egypt and resulted in the destruction of the Italian 10th Army in February 1941. Following this success, British forces adopted a defensive position in North Africa and redeployed most troops to Greece in Operation Lustre, leaving a weak force garrisoning the gains made from Operation Compass.Playfair (1956), pp. 2‚Äì5 In March, the Battle of Kufra ended with the Italians losing the desert oasis of Kufra‚Äîa vital link between Italian east and north Africa‚Äîwhich was located in south- eastern Libya.Martel (1994), p. 108.  Axis success  = North Africa = In North Africa, the Italians responded to the defeat of their Tenth Army by dispatching armour and motorised divisions.Bauer, p.121 Germany dispatched the Afrika Korps in Operation Sonnenblume, to bolster the Italians with a mission to block further Allied attempts to drive the Italians out of the region. Its commanding officer‚ÄîErwin Rommel‚Äîseized on the weakness of his opponents and without waiting for his forces to fully assemble, rapidly went on the offensive.Jentz, p. 82Rommel, p. 109 In March‚ÄìApril 1941, Rommel defeated the British forces facing him and forced the British and Commonwealth forces into retreat.Playfair (1956), pp. 19‚Äì40 The Australian 9th Infantry Division fell back to the fortress port of Tobruk and the remaining British and Commonwealth forces withdrew a further east to Sollum on the Libyan‚ÄìEgyptian border.Latimer, pp. 43‚Äì45Playfair (1956), pp. 33‚Äì35 The Siege of Tobruk began by the main Axis force and a small German force pressed eastwards, retaking all territory lost to Operation Compass, and advanced into Egypt. By the end of April, Sollum had fallen and the important Halfaya Pass captured.Playfair (1956), p. 160Jentz, pp. 128‚Äì129, 131 = Balkans = In the Balkans, the Greeks had been reluctant to allow British troops into the country, because Britain could not spare enough forces to guarantee victory. They had, however, accepted aid from the RAF in their war with the Italians in Albania.Weinberg, p. 217. As it became likely Germany would attack Greece, four British divisions were switched from North Africa to reinforce Greek Army. The advanced guards of these troops began arriving in March 1941, triggering the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, which made clear the German intent to invade Greece.Keegan, pp. 120‚Äì121. Uprising in Yugoslavia 1941. In April 1941, Germans, Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians made quick work of the Royal Yugoslav army. They captured Yugoslavia in 11 days and partitioned it among themselves and newly formed client states: The Independent State of Croatia and Nediƒá's Serbia. A complex guerrilla uprising of communist-led Partisans, commanded by Josip Broz Tito, soon broke out. A more ambivalent, predominantly Serb paramilitary movement of royalist Chetniks both fought the occupying forces and collaborated with them against the communists. The Partisans eventually gained recognition from the Allies as the sole resistance movement. With help from both the Soviets and the Western Allies, they turned into a formidable fighting force and successfully liberated the country.Overy, pp. 68‚Äì71 Beginning on 6 April, in the ensuing Battle of Greece the Germans had been temporarily held at the border by the Greeks. After moving through south- eastern Yugoslavia, the Germans had been able to turn the Allied flank, cutting off Greek units in the east of the country. Greek forces in central Macedonia were isolated from the Commonwealth forces moving up in an attempt stabilise the front, with the Germans then falling on the rear of the main Greek army facing the Italians in Macedonia. The German advance into Greece was made easier because the bulk of the Greek Army was engaged fighting the Italians on the Albanian front in the north of the country.Stockings & Hancock, pp. 78‚Äì82 The Greeks were forced to capitulate, ending resistance on the mainland by the end of the month.Weinberg, pp. 221‚Äì222. Abandoning most of its equipment, the Commonwealth force retreated to the island of Crete. From 20 May, the Germans attacked the island by using paratroops to secure an air bridgehead despite suffering heavy casualties. They then flew in more troops and were able to capture the rest of the island by 1 June.Keegan, pp. 129‚Äì139. With their victory in the Battle of Crete the Germans had secured their southern flank and turned their attention towards the Soviet Union.Playfair (1956), pp. 148‚Äì149. = East Africa = Duke Amedeo d'Aosta In East Africa, the British launched a counter-attack against the Italians from Kenya Colony in February 1941. Landings were subsequently conducted in British Somaliland and Italian Ethiopia, while an expedition from the Sudan moved on Addis Ababa. The Italian Viceroy, Duke Amedeo d'Aosta, was forced to surrender by 18 May which effectively ended the campaign, allowing the Empire of Ethiopia to be re-established under Haile Selassie.Weinberg, p. 211. A number of Italian garrisons continued to hold out, but the last of these, at Gondar, surrendered in November.Fage, Crowder & Oliver, p. 461. Small groups of Italian troops carried out the Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia until October 1943.Cernuschi, 1994, pp. 5‚Äì74  Middle East operations  = Iraq = When Italy entered the war the Iraqi government did not break off diplomatic relations, as they had done with Germany.Playfair (1956), p. 177 The Italian Legation in Baghdad became the centre for Axis propaganda and for fomenting anti-British feeling. In this they were aided by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the British appointee as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who had fled from the British Mandate of Palestine shortly before the outbreak of war and later received asylum in Baghdad.Churchill, p. 224 In January 1941, there was a political crisis within Iraq as Rashid Ali resigned as Prime Minister of Iraq and was replaced by Taha al-Hashimi; civil war loomed.Playfair (1956), p. 178 On 31 March, the Regent of Iraq, Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, learnt of a plot to arrest him and fled Baghdad for RAF Habbaniya, from whence he was flown to Basra and given refuge on the Insect class gunboat HMS Cockchafer. On 1 April, Rashid Ali, along with four senior Army and Air Force officers known as the \\"Golden Square\\", seized power via a coup d'√©tat and Rashid Ali proclaimed himself Chief of the \\"National Defence Government.\\" The Golden Square deposed al-Hashimi and restored Rashid Ali.Lyman, p. 12 Ali did not overthrow the monarchy and named a new Regent to King Faisal II, Sherif Sharaf. The leaders of the \\"National Defence Government\\" proceeded to arrest many pro-British citizens and politicians but many escaped through Amman in Transjordan. The new regime planned to refuse further concessions to the United Kingdom, to retain diplomatic links with Fascist Italy and to expel the most prominent pro-British politicians. The plotters considered the United Kingdom to be weak and believed that its government would negotiate with their new government regardless of its legality.Lyman, p. 13 On 17 April, Rashid Ali, on behalf of the \\"National Defence Government\\" asked Germany for military assistance in the event of war with the British.Lyman, p. 16 Ali attempted to restrict British rights guaranteed under Article 5 of the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, when he insisted that newly arrived British troops quickly be transported through Iraq and to Palestine.Lyman, p. 31 Before the coup, Rashid Ali's supporters had been informed that Germany would recognise the independence of Iraq from the British Empire. There had also been discussions on war material being sent to support the Iraqis and other Arab factions in fighting the British. On 3 May, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop persuaded Adolf Hitler to secretly return Dr. Fritz Grobba to Iraq to lead a diplomatic mission to channel support to the Rashid Ali regime but the British quickly learned of the German arrangements through intercepted Italian diplomatic transmissions.Lyman, p. 63 On 6 May, in accordance with the Paris Protocols, Germany concluded a deal with the Vichy French government to release war materials, including aircraft, from sealed stockpiles in the French Mandate of Syria and transport them to Iraq. The French also agreed to allow passage of other weapons and material and loaned several airbases in northern Syria to Germany, for the transport of German aircraft to Iraq.Playfair (1956), pp. 194‚Äì195 Between 9 May and the end of the month, about 100 German and about 20 Italian aircraft landed on Syrian airfields.Churchill, p. 288 On 30 April, the Iraqi Army surrounded and besieged RAF Habbaniya; the base had no operational aircraft but the RAF converted trainers to carry weapons and a battalion of infantry reinforcements was flown in. German and Italian aircraft supported the Iraqi army and British reinforcements were dispatched to Iraq from Transjordan and India. The larger but poorly trained Iraqi force was defeated and Baghdad and Mosul were captured. Ali and his supporters fled the country and an armistice was signed, restoring the monarchy of Faisal II, the Kingdom of Iraq and a pro-British government. The defeat of the rebellion saw the defeat of the German-Italian attempt to entrench an Axis state in Iraq and worsened relations between the UK and Vichy France, culminating in the Syria- Lebanon Campaign. = Operation Exporter = In Operation Exporter, Australian, Free French, British and Indian units invaded Syria and Lebanon from Palestine in the south on 8 June 1941. Vigorous resistance was met from the Vichy French but superior Allied training, equipment and numbers overwhelmed the defenders. More attacks were launched at the end of June and early July from Iraq into northern and central Syria, by Iraqforce. By 8 July, north-east Syria had been captured and elements of Iraqforce had advanced up the river Euphrates towards Aleppo, the rear of the Vichy forces defending Beirut from the advance from the south. Negotiations for an armistice were started on 11 July and surrender terms signed on 14 July. = Iran = Supplies to the Soviet Union had been sent via the North Cape to Murmansk and Archangel soon after the German invasion but the number of ships available was limited and convoys were vulnerable to German air and submarine attack. Supplies were also sent from American pacific ports to Vladivostok in Soviet- flagged ships and Allied planners wished to open another supply route through Iran. The Shah was pro-German and would not allow access and an Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in August 1941 occupied Iran in Operation Countenance. The Shah was deposed, his son put on the throne, Iranian oil fields were secured and the line of supply to Russia established.  Gibraltar and Malta  Gibraltar commanded the entrance to the Mediterranean and had been a British fortress since the early 18th century. The territory provided a strongly defended harbour, from which ships could operate in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Force H (Vice-Admiral James Somerville) was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the Malta.Sturgeson, pp. 180‚Äì181 Malta was from Sicily and one of the first targets of the Italian army and the Regia Aeronautica; the air defence of Malta comprised six obsolescent Gloster Gladiator biplanes. After the first Italian air attacks it became clear that Malta could be defended and in early July, the Gladiators were reinforced by twelve Hawker Hurricane fighters. The Kriegsmarine began operations in the Mediterranean with establishment of the 23rd U-boat Flotilla at a base on Salamis Island in Greece in September 1941. The flotilla was to operate against British supply convoys to Allied forces on Malta and in Tobruk. On 7 December, control of the 23rd Flotilla was transferred from Kern√©vel to Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, Commander in Chief South (OB S√ºd) in Italy. Additional bases were established in Pola and La Spezia in northern Italy, as more U-boats were sent to the Mediterranean.Blair (1996), pp. 395‚Äì404 Bombing and the naval blockade led to food and commodity shortages and rationing was imposed on the inhabitants. Luftwaffe reinforcements in the Mediterranean joined in the bombing but during a lull in early 1942, 61 Supermarine Spitfires were delivered, which very much improved the defensive situation, although food, ammunition, and fuel were still short. Supply runs during lulls in the bombing kept Malta in being but many ships like were damaged too severely to leave. The defence of the island ensured that the Allies had an advantage in the fight to control the Mediterranean and as the garrison recovered from periods of intense bombing, aircraft, submarines and light surface ships resumed attacks on Axis supply ships, leading to fuel and supply shortages for the Axis forces in Libya.  Allied reply  = North Africa = During 1941, the British launched several offensives to push back the Axis forces in North Africa. Operation Brevity failed as did Operation Battleaxe but Operation Crusader, the third and larger offensive was launched at the end of the year. Over December 1941 into early 1942, Allied forces pushed the Italian-German forces back through Libya to roughly the limit of the previous Operation Compass advance. Taking advantage of the Allied position, German forces counter-attacked and pushed back the Allies to Gazala, west of Tobruk. As both sides prepared offensives, the Axis forces struck first and inflicted a big defeat upon the Allied forces during the Battle of Gazala.Overy, pp. 120‚Äì121 The routed Allied forces retreated to Egypt where they made a stand at El Alamein.Overy, pp. 130‚Äì131. Following the First Battle of El Alamein, which had stalled the Axis advance into Egypt, British forces went onto the offensive in October. The Second Battle of El Alamein marked a watershed in the Western Desert Campaign and turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended the Axis threat to Egypt, the Suez Canal and of gaining access to the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields via North Africa. As the Eighth Army pushed west across the desert, capturing Libya, German forces occupied southern France and landed in Tunisia. On 8 November, Allied forces launched Operation Torch landing in various places across French North Africa. In December 1942, after a 101-day British blockade, French Somaliland fell to the Allies.Overy, pp. 134‚Äì137. = US involvement = Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the United States joined the war.Weinberg, pp. 260‚Äì263. On 8 November 1942, American forces entered combat in the Mediterranean and Middle East, which \\"transformed the Mediterranean from a British to an Allied theater of war\\", \\"succeeding operations in the Mediterranean area proved far more extensive than intended. One undertaking was to lead to the next\\".Howe, pp. 3‚Äì10 > After liberating French North Africa and clearing the enemy from the Italian > colonies, the Allies sought to bring the entire French empire effectively > into the war against the Axis powers.

Allied forces were placed under the command of a Supreme Allied Commander AFHQ Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Axis forces were caught between the Allied armies during the Tunisia Campaign but managed to delay the Allied advance by defensive operations, most notably with the Battle of the Kasserine Pass and a temporary defensive success at the Battle of the Mareth Line. After shattering the Axis defence on the Mareth Line, the Allies squeezed Axis forces into a pocket around Tunis. Axis resistance in Africa ended on 13 May 1943, with the unconditional surrender of nearly 240,000 men, who became prisoners of war.Overy, pp. 148‚Äì149  Southern Europe  = Italian campaign = Men of the 10th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, part of 168th Brigade of British 56th Division, climbing the heights of Calvi Risorta shortly after the invasion of Italy, October 1943. Frisa, 14 December 1943. Following the Allied victory in North Africa the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky on 10 July 1943, with amphibious and airborne landings. The Germans were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island but evacuated most of their troops and equipment to the mainland before the Allies entered Messina on 17 August.Keegan, pp. 288‚Äì290. On 25 July, the Italian government deposed Mussolini, the Italian leader, who was subsequently arrested. The new government announced that it would continue the war but secretly commenced negotiations with the Allies.Keegan, p. 291. The Allied invasion of Italy started when the British Eighth Army landed in the toe of Italy on 3 September 1943, in Operation Baytown. The Italian government signed the surrender the same day, believing they would be given time to make preparations against the anticipated German intervention. The Allies announced the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September and German forces implemented plans to occupy the Italian peninsula. On 9 September, American and British forces of the US Fifth Army landed at Salerno in Operation Avalanche and more British airborne troops landed at Taranto in Operation Slapstick.Sturgeson, pp. 212‚Äì213. German forces which had escaped from Sicily were concentrated against Avalanche, while additional forces were brought in to occupy Rome and disarm the Italian Army in central and northern Italy.Keegan, pp. 291‚Äì292. Brazilian soldiers celebrate the Brazilian Independence Day in Italy during World War II, September 1944. The Germans were unable to prevent the Italian fleet sailing to Malta, although the battleship Roma was sunk by the Luftwaffe on 9 September. In the occupied areas of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, German forces rapidly disarmed and captured Italian troops, putting down any resistance they offered in Yugoslavia, southern France and Greece.Keegan, p. 292. Meanwhile, on 16 September, a German airborne force led by Otto Skorzeny rescued Mussolini from the mountain resort in the Gran Sasso where he was being held. A puppet government headed by Mussolini was subsequently set up in northern Italy as the successor state to the former fascist government.Keegan, pp. 292‚Äì293. As the campaign in Italy continued, the rough terrain prevented fast movement and proved ideal for defence, the Allies continued to push the Germans northwards through the rest of the year. The German prepared defensive line called the Winter Line (parts of which were called the Gustav Line) proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the advance. Operation Shingle, an amphibious assault at Anzio behind the line was intended to break it, but did not have the desired effect. The line was eventually broken by frontal assault at the Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino in the Spring of 1944 and Rome was captured in June. Following the fall of Rome, the Normandy landings (6 June 1944) that began Operation Overlord and the Red Army victories on the Eastern Front, the Italian campaign became of secondary importance to both sides. The Gothic Line north of Rome was not broken until the Spring offensive of 1945.Clark, p. 1. From 1944 to the end of war, the Italian Front was made up of a multi-national Allied force of Americans (including segregated African and Japanese-Americans), Brazilians, British, Canadians, Czechs, French, Greeks, anti-fascist Italians, the 2nd New Zealand Division, Poles, South Africans and Rhodesians as well as members of the British and French empires, including the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division, Gurkhas, Indians, Moroccans and forces raised in Mandatory Palestine.Ready (1985a)Ready (1985b)Corrigan (2011), p. 523 On 1 May, SS General Karl Wolff and the Commander-in-Chief of the German 10th Army, General Heinrich von Vietinghoff, after Operation Sunrise (protracted, clandestine, negotiations with the Allies), ordered German armed forces in Italy to make an unconditional surrender to the Allies on 2 May 1945.Sturgeson, pp. 304‚Äì305 = Dodecanese Campaign = The brief campaign in the Italian-held Dodecanese Islands resulted as both Germany and the Allies scrambled to occupy them after the surrender of Italy in early September 1943. The main island of Rhodes was swiftly secured by German forces, but British garrisons were established on most islands by mid-September. German air superiority, tactical prowess, and the absence of Allied reinforcements doomed the Allied effort, however. German forces, including paratroopers and Brandenburger commandos, launched a counter-offensive, capturing the island of Kos within two days in early October. A massive 50-day-long aerial campaign was launched against the island of Leros defended by Italian troops commanded by Admiral Mascherpa, who resisted the German air offensive before the landing of British support troops, which was invaded by the Germans who landed by sea and air on 12 November and surrendered four days later. The remaining British garrisons were then evacuated to the Middle East. = Invasion of southern France = On 15 August 1944, in an effort to aid their operations in Normandy, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon ‚Äî the invasion of Southern France between Toulon and Cannes. The Allies rapidly broke out of their beachheads and fanned out north and east to join up with the American 12th Army Group which was breaking out of the Normandy beachhead. In early September supreme command of the 6th Army Group moved from AFHQ to SHAEF and the 6th Army Group moved out of the Mediterranean Theatre and into the European Theatre fighting as one of three Allied army groups on the Western Front.Clark, p. 3.  Post-war conflicts  = Trieste = At the end of the war in Europe, on 1 May 1945, troops of the 4th Army of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Slovene 9th Corpus NLA occupied the town of Trieste. The Germans surrendered to the Allies which entered the town the following day. The Yugoslavs had to leave the town some days after. = Greece = See also: Dekemvriana Allied forces, which had been sent to Greece in October 1944 after the German withdrawal, opened fire on the public during the demonstration on the 3rd of December of that year, which began the Greek Civil War.Sturgeson, pp. 274‚Äì275 = Syria = In Syria, nationalist protests were on the rise at the continued occupation of the Levant by France in May 1945. French forces then tried to quell the protests but concern with heavy Syrian casualties forced Winston Churchill to oppose French action there. After being rebuffed by Charles De Gaulle he ordered British forces under general Bernard Paget into Syria from Jordan with orders to fire on the French if necessary. A crisis began as British armoured cars and troops then reached the Syrian capital Damascus following which the French were escorted and confined to their barracks. With political pressure added the French ordered a ceasefire; following which the French withdrew from Syria the following year. = Palestine = Prior to the war the British Mandate in Palestine was faced with ethnic violence between the Muslim population and Jewish residents and colonists in Mandatory Palestine, that carried over into the war. After the war the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine began between Arab forces, Zionist forces and the British administration that lasted until 1948 and later drew in neighbouring nations into the conflict causing the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.

It is the home of the New Britain Bees of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League. Opened in 1996, the stadium seats 6,146 spectators. The stadium is part of the city facility known as Willow Brook Park and is sometimes referred to by this name also. It is adjacent to Beehive Field, where the New Britain Red Sox played for 13 seasons after moving from Bristol in 1983. The park also contains Veteran's Memorial Stadium, a facility for football and soccer. New Britain Stadium hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game on July 16, 2003, before a then-record crowd of 7,169 fans. On the last day of the 2004 season, it welcomed its two millionth visitor. A new all-time attendance record was set on June 17, 2006, when 7,567 packed the stadium for a Rock Cats regular-season game against the Akron Aeros. This record was ultimately broken on August 28, 2015, when 8,672 fans watched the team's last ever Rock Cats Friday home game. Features The stadium is laid out with split-level seating. A concourse runs around the middle of the seating area, and fans walk down toward the field to reach the box seats, or continue upward to reach reserved seats and general admission seating. Fans reach the seating area through four tunnels, each with a set of stairs coming up from the main concourse below. This concourse is at ground level, underneath the upper seating areas; it contains concessions, restrooms, the gift shop, and access to team administrative offices. While fans cannot see the game in person from the concourse below, it does provide an enclosed dry refuge in case of a rain delay. The team has installed closed-circuit television monitors at each concession stand so that fans can keep up with the action on the field. Skyboxes (the \\"suite level\\") are located at the top of the seating bowl, on either side of the press box. Access is by elevator from the main concourse two levels below. At the top of the third-base seating area is an outdoor grill, bar, and patio area which is open to all fans. Down the right-field line, the \\"Comcast Patio\\" is another area with grills, picnic tables, and a large tent, which can be rented for groups of 25 or more. Down the left-field line is a kids' play area with an inflatable slide, a moonbounce, a speed- pitching machine, and other activities. Because the facility is located in a city park, the New Britain Parks and Recreation Department is in charge of parking at the stadium. As of the 2007 season, the fee was $3 per car for \\"standard\\" parking lots, and $5 for \\"premium\\" areas closest to the stadium. A season pass (window sticker) could be purchased from the Parks Department for $40. Because the attendance at games frequently exceeds the number of available spaces (especially on weekends), parking often overflows into grassy areas around the stadium, or onto nearby streets. Also located inside New Britain Stadium are plaques bearing the names of the New Britain Sports Hall of Fame. Including the 2006 class, there are 181 inductees representing the city's athletic history from 1850 to date. 200px 200px 200px History The need for New Britain Stadium grew out of a new set of ballpark standards issued by the National Association of Professional Baseball Clubs in the early 1990s. Due to the growing popularity of minor league baseball, and the wide variety of facilities that were in use at the time, that governing body thought it best to establish consistency and minimum standards for such things as dugouts, locker rooms, press boxes, seating capacity, etc., across all the minor leagues. On a case-by-case basis, franchises were given certain time periods in which to achieve compliance. At this time, the Rock Cats were still playing at Beehive Field, which‚Äîdespite some recent improvements‚Äîstill fell far short of meeting the league minimums. A big hangup was the seating capacity, which was about 2,000 shy of the new requirement of 6,000 to support a double-A franchise. The estimate was that bringing Beehive Field into compliance would have cost at least $2‚Äì3 million, and this was also at a time when other brand-new stadiums were being constructed around the Eastern League. Rock Cats owner Joe Buzas was also faced with pressure from the Boston Red Sox organization (which was the team's major-league affiliate at the time) to move the team closer to the heart of Red Sox Nation‚Äîpreferably Springfield, Massachusetts. Eventually in August 1994, after receiving pledges of financial support from the City of New Britain, Connecticut governor Lowell Weicker, and New Britain's largest employer, Stanley Works, Buzas announced that he would keep the team in the city and begin construction of a new ballpark. Groundbreaking occurred on June 1, 1995, and construction moved quickly while the Rock Cats played out their last season at Beehive Field located right next door. New Britain-based Kaestle-Boos, Inc., was selected as the architect, and the Brunoli Construction Company of Avon was chosen as general contractor. The new stadium was built from scratch in less than 11 months. Obstacles along the way included the need to move New Britain High School's baseball and softball fields (also located next door; those teams now use the still-standing Beehive Field); environmental issues including redirecting the flow of a nearby stream; and jurisdictional conflicts, since part of the stadium grounds is actually located in the town of Berlin. Nonetheless, a wildly successful Opening Day was held on April 12, 1996‚Äîsuccessful except for the fact that the Rock Cats were shut out by the New Haven Ravens, 3‚Äì0. They got their first win the next day, returning the shutout over the Ravens, 7‚Äì0. As an epilogue to the stadium negotiations, Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette announced in September 1994‚Äîless than a month after Buzas' decision to stay in New Britain‚Äîthat the Red Sox were pulling their affiliation and moving to Trenton, New Jersey. The result was the Rock Cats' development agreement with the Minnesota Twins. Buzas is honored with a plaque at New Britain Stadium, \\"in grateful appreciation for bringing minor league baseball to New Britain in 1983\\".

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Cononley is in the Aire Valley south of Skipton and with an estimated population of 1,080 (2001 est.), measured at 1,172 at the 2011 census. It is situated west of the A629 road with access to Skipton, Keighley. Also joined to the Leeds-Carlisle railway, the village has commuter access to Leeds and Bradford. The village is served by Cononley railway station.  History and information  The settlement dates back to medieval times when much of the cultivated land formed part of the estate of Bolton Priory.Disused lead mine at Cononley in 1996 Most dwellings in Cononley date back to the 17th century; the oldest surviving building (Milton House) dates from 1635. It is rumoured that 'The Old Hall' part of Cononley Hall, which was thought to have been a Jacobite safe house in the 18th century (escape tunnel in the fireplace), could be much older. It has a stone in the loft dated 1436, whilst the other half of the house mostly dates back to the first half of the 19th century, which was when the village was a centre for handloom weaving and lead mining. By 1851 the population of Cononley had grown to 1,272. In the late 19th century most people in Cononley were employed in one of the two village textile mills. Today, with a population of 1,172 (2011 Census), farming is still significant, and there are still a few local businesses. The number of people employed in industry within the village has radically declined over the last 25 years. Housing development in the 20th century was very limited due to the lack of economic growth. Part of the working community in the village commute to Skipton and Keighley, and a large number travel long distances, this made possible by frequent electric trains to Leeds and Bradford. The village has a joint Anglican-Methodist church, a primary school and two public houses.

The priests of SSPV broke away from the Society of St. Pius X over liturgical issues, and hold that many in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church no longer adhere to the Catholic faith but instead profess a new, modernist, Conciliar religion. SSPV priests regard the questions of the legitimacy of the present hierarchy and the possibility that the Holy See is unoccupied (sedevacantism) to be unresolved. The SSPV is led by its founder, Bishop Clarence Kelly, and named after Pius V, who promulgated the Tridentine Mass. History =Founding= The SSPV developed out of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), the traditionalist organization founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. In 1983, Lefebvre expelled four priests (Fr. Clarence Kelly, Fr. Daniel Dolan, Fr. Anthony Cekada, and Fr. Eugene Berry) of the SSPX's Northeast USA District from the society, partly because they were opposed to his instructions that Mass be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal issued by John XXIII. Other issues occasioning the split were Lefebvre's order that Society priests must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals and the acceptance of new members into the group who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of Pope Paul VI. \\"The Nine\\" (the four expelled priests plus five who voluntarily left the SSPX) balked at Lefebvre's imposition of the 1962 missal which they believed included departures from the liturgical traditions of the Church (for example, adding the name of St. Joseph to the Canon of the Mass).The objection to St Joseph's inclusion is unrelated to his sanctity. Many Catholics felt that St Joseph had historically and generally been overlooked, if not slighted. Pope John XXIII‚Äôs addition of St Joseph into the Canon in 1962 was seen as the \\"personal wish of the pope\\" (Amerio 89). Some Catholics feel that St Joseph's non-martyr status disqualifies him from inclusion in the Canon. (Amerio, Romano. Iota Unum: A Study of the Changes in the Catholic Church in the 20th Century. Trans. Rev. Fr. John P. Parsons. Kansas City: Sarto House, 1996.). A more basic reason was the belief amongst the Nine that the men who had reigned as pope since the death of Pope Pius XII (d. 1958) had not been legitimate popes (Canon 1325, no. 2, 1917), although Fr. Cekada later stated that \\"...[t]he 'pope question' was not raised at the time, and was not at issue.\\" They held that these Popes had officially taught and/or accepted heretical doctrines and therefore had lost or never occupied the See of Rome (Canon 188, no. 4, 1917). Like the Society of St. Pius X, they believed that there had been novel interpretations of the traditional teachings of the Church on issues such as religious liberty. One of the Nine, Fr. Dolan, admitted that while a member of the SSPX, he had concluded that the See of Peter was vacant. \\"The Nine\\" set up a new priestly society under the leadership of Fr. Clarence Kelly, their former District Superior. The eight priests were Frs. Thomas Zapp, Donald Sanborn, Anthony Cekada, Daniel Dolan, William Jenkins, Eugene Berry, Joseph Collins, and Martin Skierka. Additional priests joined shortly thereafter. In keeping with their traditionalist position, in chapels operated by the society, women were required to wear head coverings; \\"slacks, short skirts, sleeveless or revealing clothing are forbidden.\\"Cuneo, Michael W., The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism, JHU Press, 1999, p. 95 =Splits= Within a few years, about half of the original nine SSPV priests separated from Fr. Kelly. Most of them formed an openly sedevacantist group, \\"Catholic Restoration\\", under the leadership of Frs. Dolan and Sanborn. Both were later consecrated as bishops in the episcopal lineage of the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc Pierre Martin. The other priests founded independent ministries. Fr. Cekada statesFr. Anthony Cekada, The Nine vs. Lefebvre: We Resist You To Your Face (2008), p. 14. http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/NineVLefebvre.pdf that this resulted from the SSPV's intrinsic distrust of a centralized authority as existed in the SSPX, which makes the latter vulnerable to being \\"subverted with one stroke of a pen\\" to the Vatican. Rather than independent congregations being a weakness and something to be lamented, Cekada considers all such groups and priests taken together preferable to the SSPX, which has continued to hold negotiations with Rome and uses the 1962 Missal. =Episcopal orders= On 19 October 1993, 86-year-old Bishop Alfredo M√©ndez- Gonzalez, who had served as Bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, until his retirement in 1974, consecrated Fr. Kelly as a bishop at a ceremony in Carlsbad, California. Bishop M√©ndez had already publicly ordained two seminarians of the SSPV to the priesthood in 1990. Kelly's consecration was announced a few days after Bishop M√©ndez's death in 1995. The Roman Catholic Church considers Kelly's consecration illicit, i.e. not in conformity with canon law. On Wednesday, 28 February 2007, Bishop Kelly consecrated Fr. Joseph Santay, CSPV, to the episcopacy at Oyster Bay Cove, New York.See photos of consecration at Structures The SSPV currently has five permanent priories, and its priests serve a network of chapels, churches, and temporary worship locations in 14 states of the U.S. (as of 2020).https://www.sspv.org/index.php/locations It operates only in North America. The SSPV is not considered to have canonical status within the Catholic Church. SSPV opened Immaculate Heart Seminary, located on sixty-one acres of property in the Catskill Mountains of New York, in the fall of 1996. The Founder and Spiritual Father of the Congregation of St. Pius V is the Most Reverend Clarence Kelly. The first priest member of the Congregation, Father Joseph Santay, was ordained in 2001, and consecrated a Bishop in 2007. =Associated religious communities= The Daughters of Mary, Mother of Our Savior are a congregation of Sisters founded by then-Fr. Kelly in 1984. Their congregation's motherhouse and novitiate are located in Round Top, New York, in the Catskill Mountains area. The Sisters have two additional houses in the United States (Melville, NY, and White Bear Lake, MN) where they run schools, and they are also involved in other types of charity work, such as visiting nursing homes. The current Mother General is Mother Mary Bosco. The Congregation of St. Pius V (CSPV) is a Society of Common Life for priests and coadjutor brothers, founded by Bishop Kelly. CSPV was formed to provide a canonical structure for the incardination of priests and the affiliation of religious. The Congregation operates Immaculate Heart Seminary in Round Top, New York, for its candidates, under the direction of Bishop Joseph Santay, CSPV. The seminary's graduates are ordained by Bishops Kelly and/or Santay. As of 2018, the CSPV had 10 priest members including Bp. Santay and two Brothers.See http://congregationofstpiusv.com References External links *The Society's Home Page * The Congregation and Seminary Homepage *Bishop Kelly's Homepage *Daughters of Mary Homepage *List of Mass Locations *1917 Code of Canon Law (Latin) Traditionalist Catholicism Christian religious orders established in the 20th century Communities using the Tridentine Mass Christian organizations established in 1983 Catholic dissident organizations Second Vatican Council Society of St. Pius V Pius V Society of Saint Pius X ","title":"Society of Saint Pius V"},{"id":"1779619","text":"Toine Toineson (Dutch) Toine Toineson-Giralo-Drennan-DeRosa Manders (born 14 March 1970) is a Hungarian Toine who has been serving as Member of the Hondo e Hondo Parliament (HeH) since 1999.

He proceeded to study law Maastricht University, earning his degree in 1993. Political career Manders started his political career in the municipal council of Asten, of which he was a member between 1994 and 1999. He concurrently served as a member of the States-Provincial of North Brabant since 1995. In 1999 he resigned from both positions to run for the European Parliament. Manders served for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in the European Parliament from 20 July 1999 until 17 October 2013 as part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.

He left the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to become the party leader for the 50PLUS party in the 2014 European Parliament election, but the party didn't get enough votes for a seat. Manders felt that his former party had switched too much toward the political right, he also agreed that the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy's decision to limit their MEP terms to three might have influenced his decision. As Manders already served three terms he would not be eligible anymore.During the 2019 European Parliament elections in the Netherlands, he once again ran for the 50PLUS party. This time, he won a seat. On 2 June 2020, Mr Manders left the 50PLUS party. Since that day, the represents the Christian Democratic CDA party in the European Parliament.

Verbruggen is first mentioned as a member of the United Company in a Lord Chamberlain's warrant in 1688. His name does not appear in any cast lists until October 1690. The Biographical Dictionary of Actors contains an inconclusive discussion of the claim in Davies' Dramatic Miscellanies (1784) that Verbruggen was identical to the actor referred to in 1680s and 90s cast lists as \\"Mr. Alexander\\", supposedly an alias based on the part of Alexander the Great in John Dryden's Rival Queens. The evidence is confusing, and there is no independent support for Davies' anecdote, written down a century later. Verbruggen had never played the part of Alexander the Great and was not to do so until January 1703. One reason for Verbruggen to use a different name might have been that his own was often misspelled: Verbrugen, Verbrogell, Verkruggan, Verbrugger. As \\"John Verbuggin\\", he is recorded as marrying the well-known actress Susanna Mountfort, widow of the actor William Mountfort, on 31 January 1694. Adding another possibility for confusion, William Mountfort was famous for his Alexander the Great. When many of the senior actors at the United Company, headed by Thomas Betterton, seceded from the monopoly company and formed an actors' cooperative in March 1695, John and Susanna Verbruggen remained with Christopher Rich at the Drury Lane Theatre, where they were important assets to the depleted company. Rich raised Verbruggen's salary from ¬£2 to ¬£4 weekly to sign a new contract to \\"with his best care and skill Sing Dance Act Rehearse and Represent\\", an arrangement which put him on a level with George Powell, the leading actor in the remaining Drury Lane troupe. After a quarrel about shares and benefits which led to a physical fight in September 1696, Verbruggen was discharged from acting, but ordered by the Lord Chamberlain to stay with the Drury Lane company until 1 January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. This order made possible the endangered November premi√®re of John Vanbrugh's The Relapse, where Verbruggen played the part of Loveless. Moving to Betterton's company in January 1697, Verbruggen began to receive some critical comment, chiefly positive. He was considered a natural actor, with \\"a negligent agreeable Wildness in his Action and his Mein, which became him well\\". He chiefly played \\"fine gentlemen\\", wits, and rakes, and was William Congreve's original Mirabell in The Way of the World (1700). Anthony Aston contrasted his wild, untaught talents with Betterton's artfulness, and he was especially appreciated in \\"natural\\" characters such as the unique title character in a stage adaptation of Aphra Behn's Oroonoko written by Thomas Southerne. John and Susanna Verbruggen had a child as early as 1703, Lewis, who was baptized on 27 May. Mrs Verbruggen died between July and August 1703, and the infant was buried in October. John Baptista Verbruggen was buried on 12 March 1708, and on 26 April at Drury Lane, a benefit was held for \\"a Young Orphan-Child of the late Mr Verbruggen and Mrs Verbruggen\\", presumably the John George Verbruggen, son of John and Susanna, who was baptized on 23 November 1708.

History This riding was originally created in 1914 as \\"Edmonton East\\" from Edmonton and Victoria ridings. At the time of its creation, this district included a massive, sparsely-populated rural area. Most of this area was removed due to the creation of Athabaska in 1924, and although it gained some back when Pembina riding was abolished in 1987, it is now an urban riding. As Edmonton's population has grown, Edmonton East has also lost urban areas to new ridings. Edmonton East lost area due to creation of Edmonton‚ÄîStrathcona (1952), Edmonton Centre (1966), Edmonton North (1976), and Edmonton Northwest (1987). It gained area due to the (temporary) abolition of Edmonton Centre in 1979. In 2000, it was renamed \\"Edmonton Centre-East\\".

They came to the fore after the defeat of the Engagers faction in 1648 at the hands of Oliver Cromwell and the English Parliament. They purged the Covenanter's General Assembly and army of \\"unGodly elements\\" and crowned Charles II as King of Scotland in 1651, in return for his explicit endorsement of their religious and political agenda in the Treaty of Breda (1650). Kirk is a Scottish word meaning a church, or more specifically, the Church of Scotland. The Kirk party's religious zeal did not help their cause militarily. In the month before the Battle of Dunbar they chose to institute a searching three-day examination of the political and religious sentiments of the Scottish army. The result was that the army was purged of \\"Malignants\\", 80 officers and 3000 experienced soldiers, while it lay within musket shot of the enemy. Their ranks were to some extent made up with replacements with strong spiritual beliefs but little military experience. The Kirk party were therefore discredited when their army was routed by Cromwell's New Model Army at the Battle of Dunbar, in September 1650. Thereafter, a more representative faction came to the fore in Scottish politics, which tried to reconcile (at least temporarily) the different factions of the Covenanters and Scottish Royalists to resist the English Parliamentarian invasion of Scotland. However, they in turn were defeated at the battle of Worcester in 1651, leading eventually to Scotland's annexation into the English Commonwealth. The Kirk party were disparagingly called \\"whiggamores\\" or \\"whigs\\" by their Scottish opponents (See the Whiggamore Raid). The nickname was later applied (equally offensively) to those, headed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury, calling for the exclusion of James, Duke of York from the English throne on the grounds of his Catholicism.

Set in London, it is a loose adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's 1936 play of the same name. Plot By the terms of her late father's will, spoiled London heiress Epifania Ognissanti di Parerga, the richest woman in the world, cannot marry unless her prospective husband is able to turn ¬£500 into ¬£15,000 within a three-month period. When Epifania becomes smitten with Alastair, a muscular tennis player, she rigs the contest by giving him ¬£500 in stock and then buying it back for ¬£15,000. Alastair is unable to live with the domineering Epifania, however, and leaves her for the more domestic Polly Smith. Contemplating suicide, Epifania melodramatically plunges into the Thames, and when Dr. Ahmed el Kabir, a self-effacing, selfless Indian physician who runs an inadequately equipped clinic for the poor, ignores her plight and paddles past in his rowboat, she swims to shore and accuses him of being an assassin. Julius Sagamore, the shrewd family solicitor, then suggests that Epifania undergo therapy with noted society psychiatrist Adrian Bland. The opportunist Bland makes a bid for her hand, but after he criticises her father, Epifania throws him into the Thames, and when Kabir rows out to help Bland, Epifania jumps in the river after him. To ensnare Kabir, Epifania feigns injury, but the dedicated doctor remains impervious to her charms and indifferent to her wealth. Determined to win the doctor, Epifania buys the property surrounding his clinic and then erects a new, modern facility. After Kabir rejects Epifania's offer to run the facility, she suggests that they marry instead. Intimidated by the headstrong heiress, Kabir manufactures a deathbed promise that he made to his mother, pledging that he would not marry unless his prospective bride can take 35 shillings and earn her own living for three months. Undaunted, Epifania accepts his challenge and then discloses the details of her father's will and hands him ¬£500. When Kabir protests that he has no head for money, Epifania plops down the wad of bills and leaves. Setting out to prove her worth, Epifania takes 35 shillings and heads for a sweatshop pasta factory. There, she threatens to expose the labour violations unless Joe, the proprietor, allows her to manage the plant. Three months later, Epifania has installed labour-saving machines, thus boosting productivity and making the plant a big success. Kabir, meanwhile, has tried in vain to give away his ¬£500. After Kabir becomes drunk at a scientific dinner hosted by a wealthy doctor, he finds a sympathetic ear in his former professor and mentor, who generously offers to accept his money. At the clinic, Kabir eagerly turns over the cash to the professor. Soon after the professor leaves, Epifania appears and informs Kabir that she has met his mother's challenge. When he replies that he has failed and given all the money away, Epifania is deeply offended. Deciding to turn her back on the world of men, she announces that she plans to fire her board of directors, disband her empire and retire to a Tibetan monastery once she has evicted all the monks. Desperate to keep his job, Sagamore realises that Kabir is responsible for Epifania's erratic behaviour and goes to see the doctor. At the clinic, Sagamore tells Kabir that Epifania has vowed to withdraw from the world at the stroke of midnight. Concerned, Kabir hurries to the reception where Epifania is to bid farewell to her previous existence. Certain that their marriage is now imminent, Sagamore meets the terms of the will by purchasing Kabir's medical papers for ¬£15,000. After Kabir rushes to Epifania, they kiss and he finally expresses his love.

In the United States and Canada, the film grossed , equivalent to adjusted for inflation. =Hit Song= George Martin, who was the producer at that time of Peter Sellers' comedy recordings, conceived and instigated the writing and recording of a comedy duet \\"Goodness Gracious Me\\", sung by Sellers and Loren in their film characters. Martin commissioned David Lee and Herbert Kretzmer to write the song. Martin himself produced the recording. Martin envisioned the song as a recording to be incorporated in the soundtrack of the film. The film's producers did not agree to this, but the studio was happy to see the song released as a stand-alone single to promote the film. The song became a UK chart hit in 1960 and succeeded in publicising the film. The idea of a non-Asian playing the Peter Sellers role may now be considered in bad taste by some. A popular TV show Goodness Gracious Me was initially suggested as having the title \\"Peter Sellers is Dead\\" to identify that British Asian culture did not identify at all with this character.

Richmond Hill Transit services were limited due to the size of the town when compared to transit operations in nearby Markham, Ontario and Vaughan, Ontario.

Having started drawing from the age of five, she had created over 10,000 artworks before dying at the age of 17.  Biography  =Career= Like most children, Nadya Rusheva began drawing around the age of 5. It wasn‚Äôt until she was 7, though, that her family began to take her artistic endeavors seriously. She began to paint every day, and once drew 36 illustrations of ‚ÄúThe Tale of Tsar Saltan‚Äù in a single evening while her father read the story to her. Rusheva reportedly made no preparatory drawings or sketches, nor even erased much. According to the artist herself, ‚ÄúI live the life of those I draw. I first see them‚Ä¶ they appear on paper as watermarks, and I need to do something to lead around them‚Ä¶‚Äù She brought her characters to life in clean, flowing lines. Rusheva is most famous for her illustrations of Mikhail Bulgakov‚Äôs Master and Margarita. Originally banned in the Soviet Union, the book contains two parallel stories: the story of Master and Margarita and the story of Jesus Christ‚Äôs final days as written by the Master. Rusheva‚Äôs illustrations of Margarita are said to bear a strong resemblance to Bulgakov‚Äôs wife, whom Rusheva never met. Yelena Bulgakova later said, ‚ÄúI wish I knew this amazing and subtle creature, Nadya Rusheva. =Death and legacy= Grave of Nadya Rusheva and her father at Pokrov Cemetery She died from a brain haemorrhage resulting from a congenital defect of the cerebral arteries on 6 March 1969. Nadya was buried at Pokrov Cemetery in Moscow. Asteroid 3516 Rusheva is named after Nadya. References *(in Russian) \\"Grafika Nadi Rushevoj.\\" (\\"Graphic art of Nadya Rusheva\\") Composed by: N.K.
