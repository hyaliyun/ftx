Snell, citing a lack of advertising revenue discontinued print in April 2014, but maintained its website. Native American Times went up for sale in early 2017. Writer and journalist, Andrea Lynette Long takes over the post as Editor in Chief of the Native American Times after only a few months contributing at-large from New York City and Dallas, Texas. Long, 39, is a 2001 graduate from the University of Oklahoma and holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology. She is the only product of the union of Donald E. Long and Aida Ester Johnson (Mora-Sequeria) is a third generation graduate from the once prestigious and world-renowned Yuchi Mission Indian Boarding School where her grandfather M.L. Long and Barbara Riederer attended in the early 1950s. Long also edits the Native Oklahoma Magazine and contributes to a New York-based News Agency, Caracal Reports. Long plans to have the Times back in print and circulation by June 2019. In 2019, Long plans to print and distribute the paper nationwide by creating an Indian Associated Press outlet allowing all agencies to report their local news without having to run independent media companies, allowing for a master glossary of data and facts for all Tribes. Talks began in late October in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs after the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke announced the BIA would be re-organized after over 100 years as a Federal Partner Agency. The Secretary of the Interior plans to close regional offices across the country in efforts to cut costs but the clean up will not aid the on-going tribal fraud occurring in the casino gaming industry. Hundreds of tribal citizens at forums have voiced outrage after reminding the Bureau of the over 100 year history of the Federal Government's inability and unwillingness to adhere to its very proposed treaties. The Times for now, will remain a free newsletter while transitioning to a full format print newspaper, and will remain free online. Online and print subscriptions are slated for early 2019.

The company's headquarters are located in Sterzing, South Tyrol, Italy. With its fleet of snow groomers, Prinoth is active in slope preparation. Its utility vehicles are used as carrier vehicles and for vegetation and biomass management.  History  Prinoth, which is part of the HTI Group, was founded in 1951 when racing driver Ernesto Prinoth opened the predecessor of the current company, a garage. Fascinated by snow vehicles applied his passion for high-performance vehicles to the development of slope vehicles and, in 1962, produced his first P 60 prototype. Two years later, the first production vehicle rolled off the assembly line. Developments continued over the years. Leitner Group acquired the company at the turn of the millennium and continued the range as an independent company under the Prinoth name, becoming the world's most complete provider of snowcats. The further acquisition of the groomer range of Canadian manufacturer Camso (previously Bombardier Inc) in 2005 and the acquisition of Camso's tracked utility vehicle range in 2009 gave Prinoth a wider area of activity beyond snow groomers. With additional equipment of all types, thanks to their tracks, the robust vehicles are able to reach the most remote locations without sinking into mud or soft soil, unlike wheeled vehicles. Thanks to the acquisition of the German forestry machinery manufacturer, AHWI Maschinenbau, Prinoth expanded its activities to the third area of activity in 2011. In addition to snow grooming and the tracked utility vehicle range, the company is now also active in vegetation management and, in addition to the cost-effective processing of forestry and agricultural land, is also seeking solutions in the global development of biomass.

Impounding the Lake Martin, the dam was built in the 1920s to provide flood control, hydroelectric power generation and water supply. Originally known as the Cherokee Bluffs dam, the dam is named in honor of Thomas Wesley Martin, president of the Alabama Power Company during the dam's construction. Preparations for construction of Martin Dam began in 1916 as Alabama Power began to purchase lands that would be flooded by its construction. Actual work on the dam commenced in 1923 and was completed in 1926; the lake filled to capacity for the first time on April 23, 1928 after heavy upstream flooding. However, the dam was not officially dedicated until 1936. At the time of completion, Lake Martin was the largest man-made body of water in the world. Filling the reservoir submerged the towns of Sousanna and Benson as well as many historic Native American sites. The dam is high and long, straddling the border of Tallapoosa and Elmore Counties with the powerhouse located on the Elmore (west) side. The spillway is controlled by twenty x gates and has a total discharge capacity of . At its full capacity of , Lake Martin stretches over up the Tallapoosa River. The lake is drawn down by an average of each winter to facilitate flood control operations at Martin Dam. Martin Dam's powerhouse contained three Francis turbines upon its original construction in 1927, with capacities of 45.8, 41 and 40.5 megawatts (MW). A fourth generator with a capacity of 55.2 MW was incorporated in 1952, bringing the total generating capacity to 182.5 MW. The power plant generates over 327 million KWh each year.

Her oldest sister Anna entered the Sisters of Loreto and became superior of the convent at Fermoy; her sister Bridget lived with community as a lay person.

While in Ireland he arranged for the Sisters of Loreto to establish a mission in Toronto.Choquette, Robert. \\"Power, Michael\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 7, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003 Dease was asked if she would take part. Canada Dease professed her vows on August 3, 1847 and two days later set out for Canada with four other sisters. They arrived in Toronto September 16, 1847 in the midst of a typhus epidemic. Power contracted the illness while tending the sick and died October 1. The sisters rented a house on Duke Street and began to give lessons in languages and music. The following year, they moved to a larger house and began a boarding school. Income from the boarder and day students helped to finance a free school for the poor of the cathedral parish. Power's successor, Armand-Fran√ßois-Marie de Charbonnel wrote: > This good ladies have suffered more than I can say. Deprived of a bishop, a > house and of many things these three years, I am amazed at their having got > through the numberless difficulties they contend with...they are esteemed > and cherished by their pupils...Reverend Mother is very delicate; Sister > Gertrude keeps to her bed; one has died; in fact they are overwhelmed.Smyth, > Elizabeth M., \\"Educationalization in the Modern World\\", Educationalization > and Its Complexities, (Rosa Bruno-Jofre, ed.), University of Toronto Press, > 2019, p. 117 Unused to Canadian winters, Sister Gertrude (Mary) Fleming had had a foot amputated due to frostbite; the founding superior, Mother Ignatius Hutchinson died. Within four years of arrival, Dease was the only member of the initial group still alive in Canada. In March 1851, Dease was named superior. She wrote Mother Frances Ball suggesting that the mission be closed and they return home. Mother Francis directed them to stay. A few sisters arrived from Ireland and more homegrown vocations developed. By 1859, thirty-one members had joined the community. Dease twice returned to Ireland to visit family and recruit more sisters. As superior, she oversaw the work of the sisters in both the publicly funded separate schools and private convent schools. Dease's ability to work with separate schools boards allowed the growth of publicly funded Catholic education in the province and the expansion of the order across North America. Thirteen establishments opened under her watch, including Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School in Toronto (named after their previous home of Loreto Abbey near Dublin), and the first in the United States in Joliet, Illinois. Although initially reluctant, she changed the curriculum to align with that of the provincial schools to better prepare the students for professional careers. To ensure the sisters were fully qualified to teach, by 1870 they began to attend Normal School. In 1881, the Vatican made the North American branch of the Institute a separate generalate and Mother Dease became its first Superior General.

Named for the Indian leader Black Kettle, the grassland is managed by the Cibola National Forest, which also manages the Rita Blanca National Grassland in Dallam County, Texas and Cimarron County, Oklahoma, and McClellan Creek National Grassland in Gray County, Texas. Setting The National Grassland consists of about 100 tracts of land interspaced with privately owned ranchland. It is located in the mixed grass prairie region. The terrain is characterized by sandy and red slate hills in addition to grassland and oak brush. The creek bottoms are wooded with cottonwood, elm, and hackberry. Wildlife includes white-tailed deer, turkey and quail. The Washita River flows through the grassland. It is a small stream here near its headwaters, only a few feet wide and shallow. The nearest town is Cheyenne where the Grassland headquarters is located. History The Washita River flows through the National Grassland. This Black Kettle National Grassland was home to the Comanche and other nomadic Indian tribes who camped and hunted in the area, attracted by abundant water and wood and buffalo herds. In 1868 Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led an attack on a Cheyenne village here in what was called the Battle of the Washita. The Grassland is named for Black Kettle, the Indian leader killed in that attack. The area became part of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian reservation in 1867 and was opened to White settlement in 1892. Farmers enjoyed many years of good crops, especially wheat until the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. \\"Poor conservation and agricultural practices, combined with periods of wind, drought, and rain stripped the area of its topsoil\\" and the government bought the land from bankrupt farmers. In 1938, the Soil Conservation Service began a replanting and restoration effort and in 1960 it was designated a national grassland. The grassland is used for recreation, oil and gas production, and cattle grazing. Recreation There are three developed recreation areas in Oklahoma and one in Texas. Dead Warrior Lake (formerly Dead Indian Lake) is in size and is north of Cheyenne. Spring Creek Lake is north of Cheyenne and is 50 acres (20 ha) in size. Sixty-acre (24 ha) Skipout Lake is west of Cheyenne. A hiking trail circles the lake. Lake Marvin in Texas is 63 acres (25 ha) acres in size. All lakes offer fishing, picnicking, and primitive camping sites. Hiking, wildlife observation, and hunting are permitted on most of the National Grasslands acreage. Croton Creek Watchable Wildlife Area, about west of Cheyenne has two trail loops totaling . The Washita Battlefield National Historic Site is located just west of Cheyenne and offers a walking trail, a visitors center, and a panoramic view of the Battlefield and the National Grassland. North of the Grassland is the South Canadian River which flows through a steep and hilly canyon. On the northern side of the River in Ellis County is the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area, of mixed grass prairie, forested river bottomland, and colorful red sand hills. Hunting for white-tailed deer, quail, and turkey is popular. Near Packsaddle is the Nature Conservancy's Four Canyon Preserve, of similar terrain. The Conservancy is attempting to eradicate non-native plant species from the Preserve and enhance prairie habitat for species such as the vulnerable Lesser Prairie Chicken. Grasslands are believed to be the most endangered ecosystem in North America. The National Grassland, Packsaddle, and Four Canyon preserve a significant remnant of mixed grass prairie and free- flowing prairie river. Antelope Hills in the background.

With the Trinity test and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and then subsequent nuclear weapons testing during the early years of the Cold War, background radiation levels increased across the world. Modern steel is contaminated with radionuclides because its production uses atmospheric air. Low-background steel is so-called because it does not suffer from such nuclear contamination. This steel is used in devices that require the highest sensitivity for detecting radionuclides. The primary source of low-background steel is sunken ships that were constructed before the Trinity test, most famously the scuttled German World War I warships in Scapa Flow. Radionuclide contamination body counting room at the Rocky Flats Plant in Denver, Colorado, made entirely from pre-World War II steel From 1856 until the mid 20th century, steel was produced in the Bessemer process where air was forced into Bessemer converters converting the pig iron into steel. By the mid-20th century, many steelworks had switched to the BOS process which uses pure oxygen instead of air. However as both processes use atmospheric gas, they are susceptible to contamination from airborne particulates. Present-day air carries radionuclides, such as cobalt-60, which are deposited into the steel giving it a weak radioactive signature. World anthropogenic background radiation levels peaked at 0.11 mSv/yr above natural levels in 1963, the year that the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was enacted. Since then, anthropogenic background radiation has decreased exponentially to 0.005 mSv/yr above natural levels. There have been incidents of radioactive cobalt-60 contamination as it has been recycled through the scrap metal supply chain. This is due to recycling sealed radioactive sources such as radiotherapy machines, not from the continued recycling of steel. Applications Devices that require low-background steel include: * Geiger counters * Medical apparatus: whole body counting and lung counters * Scientific equipment: photonics * Aeronautical and space sensors As these devices detect radiation emitted from radioactive materials, they require an extremely low radiation environment for optimal sensitivity. Low-background counting chambers are made from low-background steel with extremely heavy radiation shielding. They are used to detect the minutest nuclear emissions.

As a hurdler for the University of California, Moore tied the world record in the 120 yard high hurdles (the Imperial distance equivalent to the 110 metre hurdles) at 14.2. Prior to running a Berkeley, he had run for Sacramento City College where he was coached by L.D. Weldon and at Petaluma High School. Both became early members of that institution's Hall of Fame.http://wserver.scc.losrios.edu/~physed/forms/mediaguide05-06/halloffame.pdf He was the 1935 United States Champion in the 400 metres hurdles. Sports Illustrated shows a picture of him in Milan, Italy during the 1935 European season, helping carry injured sprinting prodigy Eulace Peacock off the track. Moore competed for the Olympic Club in the high hurdles and 220 yard hurdles into the 1940s. Toward the end of his running career in 1942, he was asked to help with a start up track and field event at Modesto Junior College. Moore served as the starter for the first meet for all but one race . . . the high hurdles, which he won. He had his running shorts on under his uniform and hastily changed to run.http://www.modestorelays.org/GeneralInfo/RelaysHistory/tabid/63/Default.aspx He gained a reputation as a top track and field official. For most of its 67-year run in Modesto Moore's name would go on to become synonymous with the event called the Modesto Relays. Moore did almost everything else to make the meet what it became, from attracting top name talent to adjusting the lights toward the track (rather than just the football field). Moore found sponsorship from S&W; Foods that brought notoriety to the otherwise sleepy Central Valley town. When S&W; dropped its sponsorship in 1994, Moore found a new sponsor in Coca-Cola. At that first meet in 1942, \\"Dutch\\" Warmerdam set a world record in the pole vault with a bamboo pole. More than a decade later, Double Olympic Gold medalist, Bob Richards negotiated a $75 cash bonus, if he broke the meet record, which Moore agreed to. When Richards arrived, he discovered the meet record was the world record, which he never achieved in his career. He served as head of the United States Olympic Committee's task force to select a bidding city for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame as an Event Director in 1988. In 2007, he was given the Howard Schmertz Lifetime Achievement Award by the U.S. Track Meet Directors Association.

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Sumner began authoring a blog where he vocally criticized the view that the United States economy was stuck in a liquidity trap. Sumner advocates that central banks such as the Federal Reserve create a futures market for the level of nominal gross domestic product (NGDP, also known as nominal income), and adjust monetary policy to achieve a nominal income target on the basis of information from the market. Monetary authorities generally choose to target other metrics, such as inflation, unemployment, the money supply or hybrids of these and rely on information from the financial markets, indices of unemployment or inflation, etc. to make monetary policy. In 2015, Sumner published The Midas Paradox: A New Look at the Great Depression and Economic Instability. The book argued that the Depression was greatly extended by repeated gold market shocks and New Deal wage policies.  Market monetarism  A school of economics known as market monetarism has coalesced around Sumner's views; The Daily Telegraph international business editor Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has referred to Sumner as the \\"eminence grise\\" of market monetarism. In 2012, the Chronicle of Higher Education referred to Sumner as \\"among the most influential\\" economist bloggers, along with Greg Mankiw of Harvard University and Paul Krugman of Princeton. In 2012, Foreign Policy ranked Sumner jointly with Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke 15th on its list of 100 top global thinkers. Nominal GDP targeting Sumner contends that inflation is \\"measured inaccurately and does not discriminate between demand versus supply shocks\\" and that \\"Inflation often changes with a lag...but nominal GDP growth falls very, very quickly, so it'll give you a more timely signal stimulus is needed\\". He argued that monetary policy can offset fiscal austerity policies such as those pursued by the British government in the wake of the 2007 economic crisis. In April 2011, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand responded to Sumner's critique of inflation targeting, arguing that a nominal GDP target would be too technically complicated, and make monetary policy difficult to communicate. By November 2011, however, economists from Goldman Sachs were advocating that the Federal Reserve adopt a nominal income target. Nathan Sheets, a former top official at the Federal Reserve and the head of international economics at Citigroup, proposed that the Federal Reserve adopt a nominal consumption target instead. Sumner has argued that one cannot account for the impact of fiscal policy without first considering how monetary policy may affect the outcome; fiscal stimulus may not succeed if monetary policy is tightened in response. Economic journalists have referred to this as the Sumner Critique, akin to the Lucas critique. Summarizing this thinking, The Economist suggested that Personal life Well known in Bentley's economics department as a \\"technophobe,\\" Sumner, who purchased his first cell phone in 2011, apparently \\"triggered expressions of surprise and amusement when he informed his colleagues that he was starting a blog.\\"  Bibliography                 See also * Market monetarism * Nominal income target References External links * Mercatus.org * Faculty webpage at Bentley University * Blog * Marginal revolutionaries, The Economist, 31 Dec 2011 Category:21st-century American economists Category:Living people Category:Monetarists Category:Monetary economists Category:Bentley University faculty Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Mercatus Center Category:1955 births ","title":"Scott Sumner"},{"id":"30514539","text":"Maria Zoe Dunning is a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and gay rights activist. She is known for being the only openly gay person remaining on active duty following a series of lawsuits against the U.S. Military and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy during the 1990s. Biography Commander Zoe Dunning, SC, USNR (Ret.) was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She was nominated to the United States Naval Academy by her Congressman James Sensenbrenner and graduated with the Class of 1985US Naval Academy Register of Alumni (2008) with a Bachelor of Science Degree. After graduation from Annapolis, she was commissioned an Ensign in the Navy Supply Corps. After attending Navy Supply Corps School in Athens, Georgia, she was assigned to the USS Lexington homeported in Pensacola, FL. At the end of her obligated active duty service, she transferred into the United States Navy Reserve and attended Stanford Graduate School of Business in Palo Alto, California. Commander Dunning retired from the Navy Reserve in 2007 after 22 years of service as a commissioned officer in a ceremony on board the USS Hornet (CV12) in Alameda, California. On December 22, 2010, Commander Dunning stood beside President Barack Obama as he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. =Discharge proceedings= In January 1993, while a student at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, she announced her homosexuality at a rally in support of Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, saying, \\"I am both a naval officer and a lesbian, and I refuse to live a lie anymore.\\"http://www.leonardmatlovich.com/gayveteransgallery.html Meinhold acknowledged his gay status on ABC's World News Tonight on May 19, 1992. On June 10, 1993, a three-member Navy administrative board recommended that she be honorably discharged despite arguments that the action violated a Federal judge's ruling the previous winter. Dunning appealed and argued that she made a statement of status and not conduct. In December 1994, another three-member Navy administrative board met at Treasure Island and unanimously agreed with Dunning's argument that her public statement that she was a lesbian did not violate Don't Ask, Don't Tell. She was also promoted between those hearings. Afterwards the military released regulations that made any future use of that defense impossible. In a letter dated May 24, 1995, the Chief of Naval Personnel wrote Dunning, \\"Your administrative separation case proceedings are closed, and you will be retained in the Naval Service,\\" ending a two-year battle. She was represented by Morrison & Foerster. =LGBT activism= In December 2010, Dunning stood next to the President as he signed the DADT repeal bill. She served as the Co-Chair of the Governing Board of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) from its founding in 1993 until 1998, and again from 2006 to through 2011. In November, 2003, she was one of thirty five LGBT alumni of the Naval Academy who petitioned the USNA Alumni AssociationUSNA Alumni Association for special status as a non-geographic chapter of the Alumni Association, similar to the association's RV chapter. The initial request was rejected on multiple grounds. Zoe Dunning has served as a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Pride,Stanford Pride the Stanford LGBTQQI alumni club, since 2011, and as its Vice-President since 2012.

It was an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea (PNG). In 1988 a civil war began with workers and landowners from Panguna mine (See also Panguna). This mine, owned by the PNG government and Bougainville Copper, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group, was established under Australian aegis.The Times, 4 September 1975 A Unilateral Declaration of Independence was made on 17 May 1990, but Australian and New Zealand-brokered peace talks tended to ignore this fact. Francis Ona controlled over half of the island, and proclaimed himself king of Me‚Äôekamui (\\"holy land\\") in May 2004. Musingku assumed the throne of Paapala Kingdom, as well as his 500-man \\"Me'ekamui Defense Force\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYsDWautKpc in the same year, and upon Ona's death from malaria in July 2005, Musingku consolidated control of the \\"Twin Kingdoms\\" on Bougainville Island. U-Vistract In 1997, seven years after the unilateral declaration of independence, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army was in control of the island, but its leadership split into factions. Ona was in control of the army, and sought full independence. His co-president in the Bougainville Interim Government, Joseph Kabui, sought rapprochement with PNG and formation of an Autonomous Bougainville Government. Musingku met with each of them as a mediator, and by 19 December 1997 had signed agreements with each. They jointly realized that it would be impossible to achieve political independence without financial sovereignty. Papala Chronicles Issue 7 p 10 As Musingku's wrote, :In other words, Bougainville needed to create her own independent and sovereign system in order to be free from the control of the other international financial and governing structure. Also, it was very clear that the funds we needed to work with in uprooting, pulling down, destroying and overthrowing the existing foreign control system could not be earned through the conventional system. A new international system needed to be established whose control and coordination would not be based overseas but right here on our own soil. At first, the \\"U-Vistract Mission\\" was established as a Christian mission program in Australia. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) found it to be an unlicensed securities and investment program. :Within a few years, some 70,000 Papua New Guineans had deposited K350 million into U-Vistract alone. U-Vistract also attracted followers in Australia, Solomon Islands and Fiji. In Australia, a small number of Queensland investors contributed some AUD500,000 between July and October 1999. http://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/docs/SSGM_09_05_bainton_cox.pdf > \\"On 19 October 1999 in one of my trips to Australia the ASIC placed me under > house-arrest‚Ä¶.

While in Port Moresby, he tried to set up a bank in the old Hawaiian Bank building, but he was shut down by the PNG government and forced to leave to the Solomon Islands. He began again to set up his system, but the Australian police in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) forced him out. In 2003 he travelled to Ona's headquarters in Guava, Panguna, Bougainville, and established a bank there. Two years later he was able to travel to his ancestral village of Tonu, where he established his bank headquarters in an old cattle farm owned by the paramount chief. Beliefs A Pentecostal Christian, most of his talks and writings are generously sprinkled with biblical references. U-Vistract was initially created as a Christian Mission, and this has continued to be its focus. Musingku has compared his life and mission to that of Biblical saviors Noah, Moses or Jesus Christ. On the new currency that he intends to issue, pictures of Jesus will join the likenesses of Musingku and other Bougainvillean leaders. Fijian Soldiers Incident Musingku in 2005 announced that he was hiring a security force from Fiji to train his guards and other governmental personnel, as well as establish security and satellite and other telecommunications for his bank in Tonu.

Brigadier General John Stark's brigade of New Hampshire militia was based at Bennington, Vermont. The battle is commemorated by the Bennington Battle Monument, located in Bennington, Vermont; the monument is the tallest man-made structure in the state of Vermont. =Royalton Raid= In October 1780 British commanders led an Indian raid against various towns along the White River Valley. War of 1812 Although Vermont was not the scene of any major battles during the War of 1812, its position as a border state with British North America, and the demands by the federal government for the recruitment of troops dictated the state's involvement in the war. Several regiments of U. S. Army troops were raised, as were militia companies for the defense of the state's northern border areas. Vermont troops served primarily in the military campaigns in northern New York.

The rarest variety, var. cremnophylax, is a federally listed endangered species which grows only on the rim of the Grand Canyon. The two other varieties are known from the Buckskin Mountains and Marble Canyon. This plant is a resident of the Kaibab Limestone, where it grows in cracks in the bare limestone. The habitat is a pavement of dry, exposed, white rock that takes full sun and brisk, dry winds. Plants occur in rock crevices that have a few centimeters of soil, if any, and accumulate a minute amount of moisture at times. The species sometimes grows alongside Petrophytum caespitosum, which occupies a similar niche. The rare var. cremnophylax was threatened with extinction when its tiny populations were trampled by tourists creeping to the edge of the Grand Canyon.

L. V. Prasad, starring Mithun Chakraborty, Shilpa Shirodkar, Dipti Bhatnagar, Sadiya Siddiqui, Mohnish Bahl, Arun Bakshi, Hemant Birje, Mangal Dhillon, Johnny Lever and Raghuvaran. Plot Siddhant Sharma (Mithun Chakraborty), a senior prison official, is widely known as \\"Hitler\\" because of his rigid disciplinarian manner. At the prison he foils the planned escape of a gangster, arranged by his gang. He beats and then sacks a corrupt prison officer who was in on it. At home Siddhant is equally authoritarian. His family are only able to relax when he is away at work. He is especially hard on his wayward brother Amar, who is unwilling to get a job and hangs around in the street. In the street Amar sees a young woman, Priya, apparently being kidnapped. He rescues her from her comically incompetent attackers, only to discover that she had arranged it herself in order to get money from her father, a corrupt businessman. Priya and Amar fall in love. Meanwhile, gangsters try to bribe Siddhant into allowing the escape of the prisoner, but he will have none of it. Daulatram, Priya's father, confronts Siddhant and accuses him of instructing Amar to woo Priya, so that the Sharma family can inherit his wealth. When Siddhant asks Amar to explain himself, Amar tells him that he and Priya are in love. Furious at Daulatram for embarrassing his brother, Amar confronts him threateningly, brandishing a knife in front of witnesses. The leader of gangsters, who is in conflict with Daulatram, sees what is happening. He takes the opportunity to kill Daulatram and frame Amar to get back at Siddhant. Unknown to him, the phone has been left off the hook during a call to the police, leaving a taped recording of events on an answering machine at the police station. After Daulatram is found stabbed to death, the police arrest Amar. Siddhant is convinced of his guilt, but his wife Sheila, a lawyer, refuses to believe it. She intends to defend Amar and discover the truth about Daulatram's murder. While she is investigating, she is injured in a road accident. When Amar learns of this, he escapes from the prison, pursued by his brother. He finds the gangsters, grabbing the sacked prison guard, but Siddhant has followed him. Siddhant shoots Amar, wounding him. Siddhant is in anguish, but the tape recording is found by the police, exonerating Amar. Siddhant arrests the gangster leader. However, the gangsters make a doctored version of the tape, rearranging the conversation to implicate Amar. The gangster boss is released. He manages to capture Amar and Priya. When Siddhant comes to negotiate, the gangster reveals that Siddhant's whole family have been kidnapped and wired to explosives. He forces Siddhant and Amar to try to kill each other in a fight to the death. Siddhant allows himself to be apparently beaten, but in an athletic leap he grabs the detonator from the gangster leader. Siddhant and Amar fight and defeat the gangsters, who are taken into custody. Back at home with his family, Siddhant leaves behind his \\"Hitler\\" persona, and learns to relax, dancing to Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\".

Founded in 2010 under the auspices of the YIRA Independent Initiatives Program, YMGE is now a registered civic organization in the Czech Republic. The inaugural conference, YMGE 2011, took place in November 2011 in Prague hosting delegates from around the world. The second annual YMGE in 2012 drew 300 students from 25 countries spanning four continents. From 2013 onwards, YMGE has been hosted in Budapest, Hungary, and has now risen to about 375 attending delegates each year. Beginning in 2019, YMGE has relocated to Lisbon, Portugal, where it has expanded its attendance to include delegates from across the globe. Conference information YMGE was created in an effort to reimagine the Model United Nations conference in a way that would be both more educational and more dynamic for delegates. It combines the best of American and European conference styles to create a hybrid, crisis-based format. The conference comprises two types of sessions. In standard committee debate, delegates in YMGE's 12x12 crisis fixture are placed in a Cabinet representing the different ministers of each of 12 European Union nations, where they address pressing issues within (and sometimes across) their nations' borders. When YMGE's unique crisis arc is revealed, delegates shift into Councils, which are 12 E.U. bodies made up of ministers of the same position from all 12 Cabinets. During these crisis sessions, delegates have the urgent responsibility of dealing with the crisis at hand within the bounds of their Council's authority and power. As in the real world, these committees form the framework of an integrated Europe: when something happens in the world that affects one committee, it affects all committees. Every committee will be kept abreast of developments in each of the others; if a new policy passed by the Belgian cabinet has repercussions in Denmark, it will be up to the Danish ministers to react. Outside of this 12x12 crisis structure, YMGE offers four Specialized Bodies for novice and intermediate delegates alike. While these committees are not integrated into the crisis, they feature dynamic issues that challenge delegates to think effectively and creatively. Mission With the development of the mission to provide an innovative, collaborative, and inspiring environment in Europe for high school students to engage in high- level debate and diplomacy, YMGE has changed its slogan to \\"Inspire, Collaborate, Innovate\\" to accurately reflect the qualities that the conference embraces. In preparation for the 2013 conference and others moving forward, Secretariat members have revised YMGE's mission, vision and values. Leadership YMGE's leadership consists of a Secretariat of eight members. At its helm, YMGE's current president is Nathalie Bussemaker. Two Directors General, making up the Senior Secretariat, manage YMGE's Committees and Operations sides. Committees encompasses all of the Cabinets, Councils, and Specialized Bodies that delegates participate in, recruitment of Yale University undergraduates to lead committees, and YMGE's educational mission. Operations leads YMGE's recruitment efforts of European and international delegations, programming during the conference, and all logistical aspects of the conference. Five Under-Secretaries-General make up YMGE's Core Secretariat, in charge of International Recruitment, European Recruitment, Conference, Branding, and Committees.

It now originates just south of Glenview Road and alongside the abandoned Skokie Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly Chicago & North Western) right of way. Glenview Creek flows in a west by southwest direction for approximately 3/4 of a mile to where it enters the Middle Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River in Harms Woods. A 1910 map shows Glenview Creek had an arm that at one time originated near the current intersection of the Edens Expressway and Old Orchard Road (formerly Harrison Street), then farmland. This long arm arising in the south is labeled as a ditch which crosses Harrison Street twice before heading north towards the main stem near Glenview Road. Another arm travels from the northeast to the southwest where it joins the arm coming up from Harrison Street at Glenview Road. The Chicago & North Western (C&NW;) tracks cross on a trestle four feet high over the creek per the map label. The map gives a key coordinate, showing the trestle over Glenview Creek being precisely 1800 feet north of Harrison Street which validates its identity and location.\\"C&NW; Lines North of Mayfair: Maps,\\" page 17. Joe Piersen, author, published in 2004 by the Chicago & North Western Historical Society. Valuation photos taken by the C&NW; from approximately 1926 show two pairs of wooden trestles-one set for the C&NW; and another set for the parallel Chicago, North Shore, & Milwaukee (CNS&M;, this line was constructed in 1925)-spanning Glenview Creek just south of Glenview Road. The original captions on the photos clearly label the creek as \\"Glenview Creek.\\"\\"Lines North of Mayfair: Photos and Data,\\" page 20. Joe Piersen, author, published in 2005 by the Chicago & North Western Historical Society. Plans to bury Glenview Creek emerge as soon as 1933. A Glenview View article from September 15, 1933 states: \\"The larger of the two projects is for the installation of storm sewer drains in that part of the village lying east of Harms Road. This job was authorized some time ago, but never completed. The cost is approximately $80,000. The other project calls for the completion of the sanitary sewer system immediately east of the Skokie [CNS&M;] tracks and lying along the Wilmette boundary line. This work, costing about $10,000, was also unfinished. Both are special assessment projects.\\"Glenview View; \\"Recommend Two Projects for Glenview-Await Washington Approval on $100,000 Program for Drainage and Sewers,\\" September 15, 1933. In 1935 the Village of Glenview awaited approval of a Works Progress Administration set of public works projects to put people to work. According to the Glenview View newspaper: \\"The largest of these projects is for the extension of the village sewerage system in the eastern part of the village. This would take in a large undeveloped area east of Harms Road and would add materially to the attractiveness of the property as a residential area. Many men would be employed digging the ditches, if this application is approved.\\"Glenview View; \\"Await Approval on WPA Projects to Provide Jobs,\\" October 12, 1935 By 1936, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) project was approved and it placed most of Glenview Creek into storm sewers from Laramie Avenue west by southwest to Harms Road both to create Depression Era jobs and to facilitate drainage. According to a January, 1937, article in the Glenview View newspaper some 35 men were kept employed channeling these waters into a system of storm sewers. The article stated that the next step would be to put the surface waters of Glenview Creek east of the parallel railroad right-of-ways of the C&NW; and the CNS&M; in a sewer.Glenview View; \\"Finish WPA Drainage Job Soon;\\"Jan. 8, 1937. Glenview Creek shows up on an aerial photo of the area dated 1938 still flowing in the open from Echo Lane west through the area that later became Cunliff Park. To the south are farms. Its two arms in the headwaters are still shown. So given the articles above perhaps the work was not finished on time.Historic Aerials by Nationwide Environmental Title Research, LLC, http://www.historicaerials.com/ At some point prior to the mid-1960s the railroad trestles over Glenview Creek were replaced by precast culverts covered by earthen fill. Into the early 1970s the creek in this section between the two railroad ROWs ran clear and featured ferns along its shaded banks. Glenview Creek now comes to the surface only in ditches between the two former railroad right-of-ways near Long Road on the far east side of the village and then again where it re-emerges from under Harms Road and flows some 150 feet into the Middle Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River. Glenview Creek historically appears on a number of maps-even after it disappeared from the surface. A USGS topographical map from 1980 clearly shows the contours of the gentle valley carved out by the then underground Glenview Creek including the stubs of its one-time arms in its headwaters.USGS Map in the Reference Library of the Glenview Public Library An undated map undated Joboul Publishing Company (Evanston, IL) Map in the Reference Library of the Glenview Public Library from the Glenview Public Library shows Glenview Creek running on the surface from the C&NW; and CNS&M; ROWs all the way to where it empties into the Middle Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River near Harms Road. The map presumably is dated prior to 1955 since it shows the Chesterfield Golf Course which was purchased that year by the Glenview Park District and renamed the Glenview Park Golf Golf Club.Glenview Park Golf Course history at http://www.golfglenview.com/gpgc-about-us/gpgc-about-us This map also shows the Edens Expressway which was opened in December 1951 so the timeframe would be between 1951 and 1955. The map however contradicts the article in the Glenview View from 1937 about Glenview Creek being buried in storm sewers though this map may have simply borrowed from other sources while sometimes maps can lag behind.

Personal life Howell was born in Cooper County, Missouri on October 8, 1842.Ornduff, Robert, \\"Thomas Jefferson Howell and the First Pacific Northwest Flora\\", Kalmiopsis (Volume 15), Native Plant Society of Oregon, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, pp. 32‚Äì41, 2008. He came west with his parents, Benjamin and Elizabeth (Mathews) Howell, and his four siblings in 1850. The Howells took up a Donation Land Claim on Sauvie Island in 1854. Howell was largely self-taught, and only had six months of formal schooling. His father was a doctor who had taught him some Latin and science, but he mostly educated himself while farming along the Clackamas River after leaving Sauvie Island. He owned several grocery stores in the Portland area over years. He served as the first post master of the Willamette Slough post office on Sauvie Island starting in 1873. He later served as the first postmaster of Creighton post office in Oak Grove, Oregon, beginning in 1904. Howell married Effie McIlwane in 1892. The Howells had two sons, Dorsey R. Howell (born in 1894) and Benjamin A. Howell (born in 1904). Howell died on December 3, 1912 in Woodstock, Oregon (now a neighborhood in southeast Portland). Career Soon after arriving in Oregon, Howell and his brother Joseph developed an interest in botany. An aquatic plant sent to Harvard botanist Asa Gray in 1878 was named Howellia aquatilis by him in the brothers' honor. In 1877, Howell started an herbarium, in which he cataloged 2,152 species. Today his collections are in many American and European herbaria, with a large set at Oregon State University. Howell published his first catalog of regional plants in 1881. He compiled and published A Flora of Northwest America between 1897 and 1903. Lacking funds, he borrowed type and hand-set the book a few pages at a time, taking them to Portland to be printed. It was the most comprehensive list of Oregon and Washington plants published up to that time. Legacy Over 30 species of plants bear the name howellii in honor of Howell. He donated his collection of approximately 10,000 plant specimens to the University of Oregon, which was subsequently transferred to Oregon State University in 1993. He spent the 1903‚Äì1904 academic year cataloging the collection for the University of Oregon. Thomas Howell is one of the 158 names of people who are notable in the early history of Oregon painted in the friezes of the House and Senate chambers of the Oregon State Capitol. Howell's name appears in the House side. His family's home, the Bybee‚ÄìHowell House, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was purchased by Howell's brothers Joseph and John in 1873 from James and Julia Bybee and was adjacent to their parents' home. References External links *\\"Thomas J. Howell and Louis F.

The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 16, 2011. The episode was written by Loren Bouchard and Jim Dauterive, and directed by Kyoung Hee Lim. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 5.066 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by David Herman, Larry Murphy and Ren√©e Taylor. The original airing of this episode was dedicated to the memory of television producer Aron Abrams, who was found dead of a heart attack on Christmas Day, 2010. Plot Linda annoys the family with her cleaning and preparations for her parents' visit. Bob decides to make his in-laws sleep in Gene's smelly room. When Linda forces Bob to fix the leak on the ceiling, he discovers a crawl space in the attic. As Grandma Gloria (Ren√©e Taylor) and Grandpa Al arrive, Bob realizes that he can pretend that he's stuck in the crawlspace to avoid them. Linda sends family friend and contractor Teddy (Larry Murphy) to rescue Bob, who tells him to come back the next day, after the in-laws leave. During the night, the kids overhear Gloria and Al having sex in Gene's bed; Tina incorporates the sounds into a sexual-zombie nightmare, while Gene samples them for his keyboard. The next day, Gloria decides that she and Al will be extending their stay for another night. Linda finds out that Bob lied about being stuck before and is now really trapped, so she cancels Teddy's visit. Bob starts to go crazy, recording himself with a video camera and befriending Louise's green nightlight. Meanwhile, Gloria makes a tuna burger recipe called Tunami and Linda makes it the Burger of the Day. Bob dreams that he goes into a bar and later encounters Louise's nightlight, who alerts him about Gloria's subversive actions (The Tunami). The scene in the bar and the restroom facilities resembles a similar scene in the horror movie The Shining (1980). While Bob is trapped, the kids get detention: Louise for lying about Bob's death (and reappearance as a ghost), Gene for presenting his NSFS samplings as a history report, and Tina for sneaking above the boys' changing room. The concerned counselor, Mr. Frond, believes they are \\"kids in crisis\\" and conducts a home visit, almost immediately threatening to call social services. As he is making the call, Gloria finds Bob unconscious and breaks through the kitchen wall, then orders Mr. Frond to hang up and never interfere with the family again. As she and Al leave, Louise fights Bob for her nightlight. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Crawl Space\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.066 million viewers and received a 2.5 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, a drop from the pilot episode. Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club rated the episode a C, expressing disappointment with the \\"evil mother-in-law comes to visit!\\" clich√© and feeling that many of the jokes fell flat. However, Kaiser found Bob's interactions with his kids one of the highlights of the episode, singling out Kristen Schaal's parts as Louise as the \\"best part of both episodes so far.\\" References  External links  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 1) episodes ","title":"Crawl Space (Bob's Burgers)"},{"id":"30515317","text":"The Kaunas State Choir is a professional choir based in Kaunas, Lithuania, founded in October 1969 by professor of the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre Petras Bingelis.

St. John's Church, the largest and oldest church in N√∏rrebro, is situated just east of the square. Located close to the major shopping street N√∏rrebrogade and The Lakes, the square is a major junction in the area where the streets Blegdamsvej, N√∏rre All√©, Guldbergsgade, Elmegade, F√¶lledvej and Sankt Hans Gade meet. History Frederik VII's arrival for the consecration ceremony of St. John's Church in 1862 The square on an old postcard The square in the 1890s The site used to be part of Blegedam Common, one of the commons which used to surround Copenhagen when it was a fortified city. The square is located at the site where the cows that grazed the Blegdam Common as well as the adjacent Northn and Eastern Commons gathered for milking. Its status as an important junction goes back a long time. Blegdamsvej is one of the oldest roads in the area and N√∏rre All√© was established in the middle of the 19th century. N√∏rrebro's first church, St. John's, was built at the site in 1862 after the so-called Demarcation Line which restricted building activity outside Copenhagen's fortifications was moved to The Lakes. The site was for a while used as a cattle market. The square emerged towards the end of the century when the area was built over and developed into a dense, working-class neighbourhood. As traffic increased, it was reduced to a large road junction. Sankt Hans Torv today No. 30: The oldest building on the square, dating from 1851 but expanded in 1861 The current square was established in 1993 as part of an urban renewal programme which sought to prompt the ongoing gentrification of the area. It was designed by Sven-Ingvar Andersson and Henrik P√∏hlsgaard for City Architect Otto K√§szner and completed in 1993. The project concentrated traffic along three sides and created a slightly undulating public space with granite paving. The square is lined with caf√©s. French-style Cafe Sebastopol (No. 32) has been located on the square since 1994. Kaffeplantagen, a local chain of coffee houses, opened its first branch at No. 3 in 2004. Notable buildings and residents The square is dominated by a large property with a concave facade flanked by two projecting, rounded corners, which occupies the space between N√∏rre All√© and Guldbergsgade.

The Indian Movement T√∫pac Katari was founded in April 1978 by Luciano Tapia Quisbert. Proclaiming itself ‚Äúthe political vanguard of the Indian people of Collasuyo‚Äù with the policy of returning to communal forms of production and the re-establishment of the indigenous languages, MITKA's base was in the campesino communities of the altiplano (Andean high plain).James Dunkerley. Bolivia: coup d'√©tat. Latin America Bureau, 1980. p. 17. The MITKA has its origins in independence movements started under Spanish rule in 1781 (by T√∫pac Katari in Bolivia and T√∫pac Amaru II in Peru) and continued as peasant movements in 1946‚Äì1952, leading to land reform, universal suffrage and the nationalization of mines between 1952 and 1964, and to the creation of a T√∫pac Katari Confederation in 1971.Political parties of the world. Longman, 1980. p. 44. The MITKA's ideology centered on the historical opposition between Indians, the continent's original inhabitants, and the Spanish and their mestizo-criollo descendants, known collectively in Quechua and Aymara as q'aras. This position rejected Marxist dialectics as foreign and denounced the equally alienating character of conventional politics, both right and left.Javier Sanjin√©s C. Mestizaje upside-down: aesthetic politics in modern Bolivia. University of Pittsburgh Pre, 2004. pp. 15‚Äì16. The MITKA took part in the 1978, 1979 and 1980 elections, running Luciano Tapia Quisbert.

It is the oldest extant water tower in St. Louis, pre-dating both the Bissell Street Water Tower and the Compton Hill Water Tower. History The tower was built in 1871 by architect George I. Barnett in the form of a Corinthian order column with brick, stone and cast iron trim. Inclusive of its base, shaft and capital, it stands tall. Inside was a standpipe with a diameter of five feet, designed to hold water. In addition to being used for firefighting, the pressure in the pipe regulated water pressure in the area. In 1912, the water tower was decommissioned, and its standpipe and internal spiral staircase were removed. The staircase was replaced by a vertical ladder, and the tower was modified to include an aircraft warning light. In 1998, the water tower was restored and lit by floodlights.St. Louis Commerce Magazine. The tower is the tallest free-standing Corinthian column in the world. At it is much taller than the free-standing Corinthian columns Pompey's Pillar in Alexandria () or the Column of the Goths in Istanbul (), or those in colonnades at the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek which are tall, the Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome at , and the Olympieion in Athens at .

Embry Hills is located south of Doraville, east of Chamblee, and north of Tucker, but is not considered part of any of the three cities, although many area businesses and residences use a Chamblee address. History In the mid-1950s, three sibling developers (Jack, James and Neal Embry, for whom the neighborhood is named) purchased 600 acres of farmland west of what is now I-85. Starting in 1957, the Embrys built the 700-800 homes in the neighborhood. They also built several apartment complexes on the acreage. The Embry Hills Club was built in 1958. The land was bisected by I-285 in the 1960s. In 1963, the first phase of the Embry Hills retail district was built. The Embry National Bank (now United Community Bank) soon followed. DeKalb County Public Library recently constructed the new Embry Hills Library, replacing the neighborhood branch that opened in 1990. Transportation Public transportation is available at the Doraville MARTA station. Interstate access from I-85 and I-285 is through the Pleasantdale Road and Chamblee Tucker Road exits, respectively.

Braica was born in Brooklyn, New York and is an alumnus of Bishop Ford High School and Queens College. Braica began his head coaching career at St. Francis College in 2010 and had 22 years of coaching experience at the time split between New York City Tech, St. Francis and St. John's as an assistant coach. Since becoming the 17th head coach in the programs history in 2010, Braica has reached the Northeast Conference Tournament each of his 6 years and produced a 98‚Äì91 overall record and a 65‚Äì41 conference record. Biography Braica attended St. Agnes High School from 1980‚Äì82 and Bishop Ford in Brooklyn from 1982‚Äì84. Braica went on to Queens College and played for the Knights from 1984‚Äì88 as a point guard. At Queens College, Braica met Norm Roberts and became great friends; that would later lead to Roberts hiring Braica as his assistant at St. John's University. Prior to St. Johns's, Braica was an assistant coach for Ron Ganulin at St. Francis College, where in Braica's last seven years, the Terriers posted a 118-83 record, including an 88-42 mark in the Northeast Conference. Other notable accomplishments during Braica's tenure as an assistant at St. Francis include finishing with a .500 or better record in the league seven straight years, at that time the longest active streak in the league.

There was a M√ÅV railway between Szigetv√°r and the second proximate city Kaposv√°r. Since the 1970s, the only way to come to the village has been the main road numbered 67, and by bus. The through traffic is big, because the trucks going to Lake Balaton drive through. History Before the 1950s, Szentl√°szl√≥ was placed in Somogy. The first written sources derive from 1287‚Äì1240. The patron saint is Saint Ladislaus I. Here there was a rectory named Margitapuszta. Szentl√°szl√≥'s rectory was given by Ladislaus I. In the Turkish occupation there was no constant population. In the 18th century Germans came to the village. After World War II they deployed to East Germany, and instead of them, came people from Slovakia. The first church was built in 1738.

Although polyphenols are speculated to be part of the health-promoting effects of consuming fruits and vegetables, no evidence exists to date that dietary polyphenols actually provide health benefits.  Bioavailability  Polyphenols have poor bioavailability, indicating that most of what are consumed are extensively metabolized and excreted. Gallic acid and isoflavones may show absorption of about 5%, with amounts of catechins (flavan-3-ols), flavanones, and quercetin glucosides even less. The least well-absorbed phenols are the proanthocyanidins, galloylated tea catechins, and anthocyanins.  Cognitive function  Due to their potential beneficial effects on pathways related to cognitive function such as inflammation and vasodilation, several types of polyphenol subclasses including blueberries and resveratrol have been investigated as a potential intervention for cognitive outcomes in both healthy adults and those with chronic diseases (e.g. mild cognitive dysfunction and cardiovascular disease).  Cardiovascular health  The European Food Safety Authority found that flavonols in cocoa - at doses exceeding 200 mg per day - could contribute to normal function of the vascular endothelium, and olive oil polyphenols (5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (e.g. oleuropein complex and tyrosol) \\"contribute to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative damage\\", if consumed daily. Because long-term studies of high polyphenol intake have not been conducted, there is a lack of knowledge about safety or effect on health of intake above levels in a normal diet. A 2017 Cochrane review concluded that there is moderate-quality evidence that flavonol-rich cocoa products decrease blood pressure by only 2 mmHg in the short-term, although longer-term studies are needed.  Antioxidant activity  As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), dietary flavonoids have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion. Unlike controlled test tube conditions where antioxidant effects may result when high concentrations of flavonoids are used, the fate of ingested flavonoids in vivo shows they are poorly conserved (less than 5%), with most of what is absorbed existing as chemically-modified metabolites destined for rapid excretion.  Cancer  , there is little evidence that dietary flavonoids lower the risk of cancer.  Phlebotonic  Phlebotonics of heterogeneous composition, consisting partly of citrus peel extracts (flavonoids, such as hesperidin)) and synthetic compounds, are used to treat chronic venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids. Some are non-prescription dietary supplements, such as Diosmin, while one other - Vasculera (Diosmiplex) - is a prescription medical food intended for treating venous disorders. Their mechanism of action is undefined, and clinical evidence of benefit for using phlebotonics to treat venous diseases is limited.

It has posed health risks to the Canadian population and is an area of concern for Canadian lawmakers. Air, water and soil pollution as well as the health effects associated with these three types of pollution, are prominent points of contention in modern Canadian society.  Air pollution  Air pollution in Canada is contributed by industrial and vehicular emissions, agriculture, construction, wood burning and energy production. A recent report found that Canadian companies contributed 73% more to air pollution than companies in the United States. Within the 73% more emissions it was found that Canadian companies contributed 29% more respiratory toxins into the air than the U.S.\\" While Canadian businesses may release more emissions than those in the U.S, overall emissions have decreased in the past few years. This can be evidenced with Environment Canada's 2010 document named Air Pollutant Emission Summaries and Historical Emission Trends. This report found that 2010 emissions, when compared to 2009 emissions, saw an overall decrease. Additionally, it was found that heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (smog precursors) were at lower levels in 2010 than in 1990. =Oil sands pollution= While overall pollution levels have dropped, it was found that oil sands pollution has increased by 20% since 2009. According to a 2009 study, Alberta‚Äôs oil sands are one of the major causes of air pollution in Canada. mirror Tar sands facilities were found to be among the top four highest polluters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)- a major air contaminant. VOCs and other air contaminants are set to increase in the future as a result of continued output from the oil sands. Oil sands pollution is not only set to increase VOCs, but also, acid rain. Acid rain is rain that has been contaminated by airborne chemicals, making it acidic. Two major causes of acid rain are sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Acid rain can cause damage to soil, water, wildlife, plants and buildings. Additionally, the airborne particles that cause acid rain can also contribute to smog. In recent years progress has been made in reducing acid rain, however, Alberta's oil sands may soon set back this progress. =Pollution from oil wells= In southeastern Saskatchewan, air pollution from oil production has breached provincial air quality standards hundreds of times since 2014. =Canada/United States transboundary pollution= In recent years, the Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement, signed on 13 March 1991, has improved air quality by reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in both countries. The agreement was meant to address the issue of transnational air pollution between the two countries. The agreement was expanded in 2000 to also include goals of reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds and levels of ground-level ozone. Ground-level ozone is caused by reactions between nitrogen oxides and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. Ozone is a contributor to smog and is known to cause numerous respiratory diseases. The 2012 Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement Progress Report found that \\"Canada's total emissions of sulfur dioxide have decreased by 57% from 1990 levels while the U.S. has reduced total sulfur dioxide emissions from covered sources by 67% from their 1990 emission levels. Between 2000 and 2010, Canada reduced total emissions of nitrogen oxides by 40% in the transboundary ozone region while U.S. total nitrogen oxide emissions decreased by 42% in the region\\". While transnational pollution between the United States and Canada has decreased many Canadians still say they contend with polluted air as a result of drifting pollution from the U.S. In 2006 the government of Ontario announced that \\"5,000 premature deaths caused by smog in the province every year can be attributed to air pollution that crosses the Canada-U.S. border.\\" Additionally, the then (2006) mayor of Halifax, Peter Kelley, also proclaimed \\"over 50 per cent of air pollutants over New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are from the U.S. For us, we're trying to deal with what's coming our way, but also what we generate here as well.\\" In an attempt to combat the pollution a petition was created. In 2006 the petition was filed by thirteen Canadian municipalities to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calling for a reduction in coal-fired plants. =Climate Change Accountability Act= The Climate Change Accountability Act called for greenhouse gas emissions to be 25% below 1990 levels by 2021, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Although the bill was passed by the House of Commons, the bill was defeated by the Senate. Environment Minister Jim Prentice stated in early 2010 that the new goal for greenhouse gas emissions would be 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, the equivalent of a 3% increase from 1990. Water pollution Water pollution is not a major problem nationally, although it can be a source of concern in some localities. Major causes of water pollution in Canada include acid rain, groundwater contamination and unclean wastewater. =Oil sands pollution= As previously stated, Alberta's oil sands are set to cause growing levels of acid rain consequentially leading to an increase in water contamination in the area. Acid rain will cause Canada's lakes and rivers to become further acidified. This is a problem as it decreases levels of surface water calcium. This lower concentration of calcium is already having particularly adverse effects on plant life, as can be seen with the Daphnia species-an important food source for aquatic species and marine life. A recent study at the University of Alberta found levels of metals like arsenic, lead and mercury to be considerably higher than national guidelines in water downstream from Albertan oil sites. This pollution could potentially result in harmful health implications for fish and other wildlife. The study further discerned that their findings were \\"contrary to claims made by industry and government\\" who purported that \\"pollutants are from natural sources and not from the expanding production of oil from tar sands.\\" Other than contributing to acid rain and high levels of metals in water, sites of oil production can also cause significant damage by human error and runoff. A prominent example is the 2007 case involving the Athabasca River. Due to human error, energy magnate Suncor spilled 9.8 million liters of oil sands waste water into the river causing adverse effects for people and wildlife in the area. The Athabasca River can also be used as an example of oil sands runoff. It was found that the Athabasca's waters, which are downstream from the oil sands, had higher concentrations of pollutants as a result of runoff. High concentrations of pollutants can have serious consequences for wildlife and humans. Recently, it was reported that there were significant increases in fish deformities as well as an increase in cancer rates in a Native community downstream from the Athabasca. =Great Lakes pollution= Pollution of the Great Lakes, the world‚Äôs biggest bodies of fresh water, continue to be a significant problem for both Canada and the United States. According to Derek Stack, executive director of Great Lakes United, \\"High pollution levels in the Great Lakes basin continue to take an apparent toll on the air and water quality of the ecosystem.\\" In 2002, it was reported that the Great Lakes basin was home to 45% of all toxic air pollution in Canada, in turn affecting the Great Lakes' water. An even more recent report suggests that the Alberta oil sands' impact could reach as far as the Great Lakes. The report warns that \\"[oil] refineries will be using the Great Lakes ‚Äòas a cheap supply‚Äô source for their copious water needs and the area‚Äôs air ‚Äòas a pollution dump'.\\" In September 2012, the United States and Canada signed amended version of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The overarching purpose of the Agreement is to \\"restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters\\". Significant amendments made to the Agreement include \\"address[ing] aquatic invasive species, habitat degradation and the effects of climate change, and support continued work on existing threats to people's health and the environment in the Great Lakes Basin such as harmful algae, toxic chemicals, and discharges from other vessels\\". However, some people contend that the changes made to the Agreement while good in principle, lack the \\"hard number goals, and actions to reach them.\\" =Arctic waters pollution= Under the 1970 Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, the Canadian government established a document to prevent pollution of Canadian Arctic waters. However, in recent years Arctic waters have become increasingly polluted. It was recently found that due to pollution some waters have levels of lead that are higher than the Canadian guidelines. Coastal communities that emit waste also contribute to arctic pollution. Arctic coastal communities do not presently have the infrastructure necessary to properly deal with their waste, this could lead to greater pollution in the future as these communities continue to grow in size. Other than coastal communities, waste and litter from the rest of the world continues to be a significant issue in the Arctic, with waste levels doubling in the past ten years. The most significant types of litter found are plastic items and plastic bags. =Pollution from sewage= The Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality are guidelines for drinking water quality standards in Canada developed by Health Canada. These guidelines set forth recommendations for the maximum concentrations of various substances in drinking water. Provinces and territories are responsible for enforcing these guidelines, as there is no national regulatory body for drinking water. Water pollution by sewage is one of the main culprits involved in polluting drinking water. Advocacy group Ecojustice estimates overall raw sewage dumping in Canada to be around 200 billion litres a year. The Canadian government recently announced waste water regulations that would allow for sewage to be dumped into Canadian waters until 2040. Proper measures for waste water disposal will not immediately be put in place, rather, they will be implemented gradually from 2020 to 2040. However, in the meantime, Canadian municipalities may continue to pollute their waters by dumping sewage. This can prominently be viewed with Halifax, Nova Scotia. In Halifax, human waste is dumped directly into the Halifax harbour. This dumping can mainly be attributed to a failure in their sewage treatment infrastructure. Victoria, British Columbia also follows a similar practice by getting rid of their untreated waste into the ocean. However, the government has plans to open operational treatment facilities for 2016. Water pollution resulting from sewage can also be attributed to error in sewage facilities. A recent example can be evidenced with Ottawa. In 2004 Ottawa experienced a 190 million liter raw sewage spill into the Ottawa River. Similarly, Winnipeg, released \\"partially treated sewage water into the Red River for seven weeks\\" in 2011. However, in this case, the city was actually charged for their pollution. Numerous other places like Richmond B.C and Calgary A.B, have experienced significant sewage spills in their native waters. Soil pollution While soil pollution is present in Canada, it is not yet an area of great national concern. Some of the main causes of soil pollution include chemical/oil spills into the ground, road salt, excessive pesticide use by farmers, acid rain, and polluted water. =Soil degradation/pollution= As Environment Canada mentions \\"soil degradation degrades the land and places significant stress on ecologically sensitive biota and flora\\". Soil degradation in Canada's biologically sensitive forests as a result of pollution, is one of the most significant cases of degradation in the country. One study found that 12% of Alberta's forests‚Äô soils are over their acid carrying capacity. This rise in acidity is attributed to the continual extraction of fossil fuel from the Alberta oil sands. Oil refinery sites, like those found in Alberta, have become some of the most dominant contributors to Canadian soil pollution. A further example can be witnessed in Calgary, where a neighbourhood built on an old Imperial Oil refinery needed their soil replaced due to contamination. =Road salt pollution= As a result of Canada's icy winters, salt is needed in order to deice slippery roads. The primary ingredient of road salt is sodium chloride. Road salt, while helping cars and people to gain traction in the winter, can have serious consequences for soil. As National Geographic found, \\"Road salt can pollute soil at every stage in the deicing process.\\" This pollution is a result of numerous factors such as runoff, application and spray from vehicles. In Canada, there has been research that shows that \\"salt run-off from roads can increase local chloride levels to between 100 and 4,000 times normal levels.\\" Salt can have adverse effects on soil and soil composition. Significant levels of chloride (one of the main components in salt) can \\"alter the soil ‚Äòs pH chemistry and elevate levels of heavy metal pollutants, while at the same time causing a loss of soil structure and killing off micro-organisms\\". These effects can have dire consequences for plants rendering them unable to grow or stunting their growth. =PCB pollution= Salt and oil refineries are not the only contaminants of soil. Polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs also pollute the soil. PCBs are released into the environment through \\"spills, leaks from electrical and other equipment, and improper disposal and storage\\". However, recently it was found that household weeds were able to remove PCBs from contaminated soil. A study found that \\"the weeds stored PCBs in their shoots and could be harvested for disposal cutting the need to expensively remove and incinerate contaminated soil\\". Health effects of pollution Pollution is associated with numerous negative health effects in humans. =Air pollution= Air pollution has been shown to negatively effect humans' cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Lung tissue can be damaged with direct exposure to air pollutants such as ozone, potentially causing lung inflammation and impairment of lung function. As Environment Canada mentions \\"impacts from exposure can range from \\"minor breathing problems to premature death\\". Some of the main respiratory diseases caused by air pollution include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Specific cardiovascular disease and problems caused by air pollution include heart attack, hypertension, inflammation around the heart, stroke and arrhythmias. Health Canada estimates that 5,900 Canadians die every year from air pollution. A 2008 study by the Canadian Medical Association estimated that almost 3,000 Canadians die annually from short-term exposure to air pollution, while another 18,000 die annually due to long-term effects of polluted air. The study estimated the economic impact of air pollution to be at $8 billion, including lost productivity, health care costs, deaths and a decrease in quality of life. = Water pollution = Contaminated water can result in a myriad of serious consequences for human health. Additives used to clean drinking water may cause themselves harm. Chlorine, widely used in Canadian drinking water, is a prominent example. Through drinking water treated by chlorine over a long period of time, the risk of certain cancers, such as bladder and colon, increase. Additionally, pregnant women who drink significant amounts of tap water have an increased risk of miscarriage. Drinking polluted water can also result in E. coli (as found in the 2000 outbreak in Walkerton), Giardia, or Cryptosporidium. = Soil pollution = Soil pollution also causes numerous diseases. Some of the most prominent are cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, dysentery, skin infections, and stomach infections.

It was inspired by the 1950 science fiction novel Needle by Hal Clement.  Plot  The story revolves around Hikaru Takabe, a reclusive teenage girl who is secretly host to a being known as Horizon, in search of an intergalactic murderer intent on killing humanity.  Release  The series, partly inspired by the science-fiction novel Needle by Hal Clement, began serialization in Monthly Comic Flapper in April 2008. It was licensed in North America by Vertical. The last two volumes of the Vertical edition are out of print, and are only available in digital format.  Reception  It was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Adaptation from Another Work in 2011. Deb Aoki from About.com said that \\"7 Billion Needles is a solid and entertaining sci-fi/action read that's well worth a look\\", and praised the \\"crisp and straightforward graphic storytelling\\", but criticized the \\"unimaginative character designs\\" saying, \\"do all Japanese schoolgirls look like siblings, just with different hairstyles?\\". Aoki also noted that the plot is basically the same as Parasyte. Writing for Anime News Network, Carlo Santos described the manga as a \\"modern polish and hard-hitting action\\". He also commented that, in the end, \\"Hikaru's quest as the Everyday Teenager Who Miraculously Discovers Special Abilities And Must Now Save The World is just like all the other ones\\". Ain't It Cool News's Scott Green thought \\"7 Billion Needles... maybe it was some failing that I didn't figure it out earlier, but once the title's meaning became evident, it became pretty brilliant.\\" Green praised \\"the ways in which the manga plays with perception, senses, and connection with alien intelligence are the ways in which sci-fi writing is made interesting\\", but noted that \\"it doesn't manage that to the extent that the series becomes one of the more urgently involving that you'll read.\\" Chris Kirby writing for Mania Entertainment said it's \\"a very exciting series as it avoids any preconceived pratfalls this type of story can lean towards.\\" Kirby \\"would love to see this series animated because of how clean and attractive the art is and how mature the overall story is.\\" Joseph Luster from Otaku USA said that \\"there are times that Tadano's artwork comes off as slightly amateurish; awkward poses and angles abound, mostly from human characters. However, he makes up for it in spades in almost every other area\\" and noted \\"the hulking mutations are reminiscent of Akira's Tetsuo [Shima]‚Äîorgans and appendages spewing and twisting together in a tidal wave of flesh.\\" Luster also commented that it \\"makes for a briskly paced and well-constructed narrative that, despite some of the aforementioned shortcomings, is one of the better examples of sci-fi manga currently available.\\" Carlo Santos in another review \\"love how the ending of 7 Billion Needles hinges on humankind's capacity for love. It's a beautiful, moving message in a series where so much of the action is centered around fantastical, non-human things\\", but said that with \\"powers building up, the final battle turns into this outlandish celestial light show that would be more at home in Dragon Ball rather than a thoughtful sci-fi masterpiece.\\"  References   External links  *7 Billion Needles at Vertical * Category:Manga based on novels Category:Horror anime and manga Category:2008 manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Media Factory manga Category:Vertical (company) titles ","title":"7 Billion Needles"},{"id":"30515983","text":"Bunga bunga is a phrase of uncertain origin and various meanings that dates from 1910, and a name for an area of Australia dating from 1852. By 2010 the phrase had gained popularity in Italy and the international press to refer to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's sex parties, which caused a major political scandal in Italy.

In Malay-speaking countries bunga means flower. As such bunga bunga (written as bunga-bunga) is simply the plural form of flower. Possibly, Makassan contact with Australia can explain the existence of the word within the Australian Aborigines' culture.

It was established in 1959. Since October 1998 the magazine has been published by IOP Publishing on behalf of CERN. Up to volume 45 no. 5 (2005) the magazine was published both in English and French. The French edition was published under the title Courrier CERN : Revue internationale de la physique des hautes √©nergies. Currently it is a single-language edition where articles are published either in French or English with an abstract in the other language, although most articles are in English. CERN Courier is distributed to member-state governments, institutes and laboratories affiliated with CERN, and to their personnel. It is published monthly, except for January and August. The views expressed are not necessarily those of the CERN management. The first editor, Roger Anthoine, started CERN Courier with an initial print run of 1000, and by the time he had to put it on hold, little more than a year later, the number had already risen to 3000. In 2015 some 21,000 copies are printed 10 times a year and the journal has a massive readership online. Over the years, particularly with the advent of the CERN Bulletin in 1965, CERN Courier evolved from being a house publication to become a scientific journal. The Courier thus became the ambassador of CERN and particle physics to a large community of knowledgeable specialists and inquisitive people, having been rebranded in 1974 with the subtitle International Journal of High-Energy Physics. In addition to news and events, CERN Courier will often present cover pieces on influential physicists or retrospectives of significant historical moments in high-energy-physics history. Book reviews, white papers, obituaries, and product releases are also featured in the magazine. The 50th anniversary of the first publication of the CERN Courier provided the opportunity for a modest celebration on 2 September 2009. All six of the principal editors that the magazine has had over its 50 years met together for the first time. After getting acquainted and re- acquainted over lunch, they gathered in the library at CERN to answer questions about producing the magazine over the years. From right to left: Roger Anthoine, Alec Hester, Brian Southworth, Gordon Fraser, James Gillies and Christine Sutton. The CERN Courier has been published regularly since the start, apart from the period April 1960 to January 1962 when the magazine \\"hibernated\\" owing to unfortunate circumstances. The magazine has been edited by the following editors: * Roger Anthoine (1959 - 1961) * Alec Hester (1962 - 1965) * Brian Southworth (1966 - 1985) ** Together with Gordon Fraser (from 1977, volume 17, no. 4), Henri-Luc Felder (French edition from 1973, volume 13, no. 4) * Gordon Fraser (1986 - 2001) ** Together with Brian Southworth (until 1990, volume 30, no. 4) and Henri-Luc Felder (French edition until 1992, volume 32, no. 8) * James Gillies (2002 - 2003) **The first issue in 2003 was co-edited with Christine Sutton * Christine Sutton (2003 - 2015) ** Christine Sutton handed over to the next editor as of no. 9, 2015 * Antonella Del Rosso (2015 - 2016) ** Antonella Del Rosso was editor from no.9 2015 to no. 5 2016 * Matthew Donald Chalmers (2016 - ) ** Matthew Chalmers has been the editor since no. 6 2016.

S. Wong Bloody Saturday () is a black-and-white photograph taken on 28 August 1937, a few minutes after a Japanese air attack struck civilians during the Battle of Shanghai in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Depicting a Chinese baby crying within the bombed-out ruins of Shanghai South railway station, the photograph became known as a cultural icon demonstrating Japanese wartime atrocities in China. The photograph was widely published, and in less than a month had been seen by more than 136 million viewers. The photographer, Hearst Corporation's H. S. \\"Newsreel\\" Wong, also known as Wong Hai-Sheng or Wang Xiaoting, did not discover the identity or even the sex of the injured child, whose mother lay dead nearby. The baby was called Ping Mei. One of the most memorable war photographs ever published, and perhaps the most famous newsreel scene of the 1930s, the image stimulated an outpouring of Western anger against Japanese violence in China. Journalist Harold Isaacs called the iconic image \\"one of the most successful 'propaganda' pieces of all time\\". Wong shot footage of the bombed-out South Station with his Eyemo newsreel camera, and he took several still photographs with his Leica. The famous still image, taken from the Leica, is not often referred to by name‚Äîrather, its visual elements are described. It has also been called Motherless Chinese Baby, Chinese Baby, and The Baby in the Shanghai Railroad Station. The photograph was denounced by Japanese nationalists who claimed that it was staged. Capturing the image During the Battle of Shanghai, part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japanese military forces advanced upon and attacked Shanghai, China's most populous city. Wong and other newsreel men, such as Harrison Forman and George Krainukov, captured many images of the fighting, including the gruesome aftermath of an aerial bombing made by three Japanese aircraft against two prominent hotels on Nanking Road on Saturday, August 14, 1937, or \\"Bloody Saturday\\". Wong was a Chinese man who owned a camera shop in Shanghai.Camhi, Leslie. \\"Film: A Dragon Lady and a Quiet Cultural Warrior\\". The New York Times, January 11, 2004. Retrieved on July 3, 2011. The National Revolutionary Army began to retreat from the city, leaving a blockade across the Huangpu River. An international group of journalists learned that aircraft from the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) were to bomb the blockade at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 28, 1937, so many of these gathered atop the Butterfield & Swire building to take photographs of the bombing attack. At 3 pm, no aircraft were to be seen, and most of the newsmen dispersed, except H. S. \\"Newsreel\\" Wong, a cameraman working for Hearst Metrotone News, a newsreel producer. At 4 pm, 16 IJN aircraft appeared, circled, and bombed war refugees at Shanghai's South Station, killing and wounding civilians waiting for an overdue train bound for Hangzhou to the south. Wong descended from the rooftop to the street, where he got into his car and drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: \\"It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning overhead bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [of film] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped.\\" Wong never discovered the name of the burned and crying baby, whether it was a boy or a girl, or whether he or she survived. The next morning, he took the film from his Leica camera to the offices of China Press, where he showed enlargements to Malcolm Rosholt, saying, \\"Look at this one!\\" Wong later wrote that the next morning's newspapers reported that some 1,800 people, mostly women and children, had been waiting at the railway station, and that the IJN aviators had likely mistaken them for a troop movement. The Shanghai papers said that fewer than 300 people survived the attack. In October, Life magazine reported about 200 dead. Publication Wong sent the newsreel footage on a U.S. Navy ship to Manila and from there, the film was flown to New York City aboard a Pan American World Airways airliner. Beginning in mid-September 1937, the newsreel was shown to movie theater audiences, estimated a month later to number 50 million people in the U.S. and 30 million outside of the U.S. and the still image of the crying baby was printed in Hearst Corporation newspapers and affiliates, some 25 million copies. A further 1.75 million non- Hearst newspaper copies showed the image in the U.S., and 4 million more people saw it as a matte reproduction in other newspapers. Some 25 million people saw it internationally. It first appeared in Life magazine on October 4, 1937, at which point it was estimated that 136 million people had seen it. On the facing page in Life magazine, another photograph showed the baby on a stretcher receiving medical care. Reaction The \\"unforgettable\\" image became one of the most influential photos to stir up anti-Japanese feeling in the United States. A \\"tidal wave of sympathy\\" poured out from America to China, and the image was widely reproduced to elicit donations for Chinese relief efforts. Catalyzed by the image, the U.S., the United Kingdom and France protested Japanese bombing of Chinese civilians in open cities. Senator George W. Norris was influenced by the image, being convinced to abandon his longtime stance of isolationism and non-interventionism‚Äîhe railed against the Japanese as \\"disgraceful, ignoble, barbarous, and cruel, even beyond the power of language to describe.\\" Americans used terms such as \\"butchers\\" and \\"murderers\\" against the Japanese. Subsequent to Shanghai's surrender, IJN Admiral K≈çichi Shiozawa said to a reporter from The New York Times at a cocktail party: \\"I see your American newspapers have nicknamed me the Babykiller.\\" The image was voted by Life readers as one of ten \\"Pictures of the Year\\" for 1937. In 1944, Wong's newsreel sequence was used within the Frank Capra film The Battle of China, part of the Why We Fight series. Legacy While in art school in the late 1940s, Andy Warhol painted a version of the photograph, the earliest of his many paintings based on photographs; the original artwork has not been located and may be lost. Warhol's Disaster Series in the 1960s was a return to that format, to interpretations of the highly visible works produced by photojournalists. In 1977, Lowell Thomas, journalist and narrator for Hearst rival Movietone News, set the photo's influence in America as high as two of the most iconic World War II images: a French man grimacing in tears as his country's soldiers abandon France in June 1940, and Joe Rosenthal's Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, shot in February 1945. Wong retired to Taipei in the 1970s and died of diabetes at his home at the age of 81 on March 9, 1981. In 2010, Wong was honored as a pioneering Asian-American journalist by the Asian American Journalists Association. In 2000, artist and journalist Miao Xiaochun projected the famous image against a white curtain, using the faintness of the projection to signify the diminution of its impact over time. The photograph appeared in the Time‚ÄìLife book 100 Photographs that Changed the World, published in 2003. National Geographic included the photograph in their Concise History of the World: An Illustrated Timeline in 2006. The \\"searing image\\" was said by National Geographic author Michael S. Sweeney to have served as the \\"harbinger of Eastern militarism\\". =Allegations of falsehood= Look magazine in December 1937. At the time, Japanese nationalists called the photograph a fake, and the Japanese government put a bounty of $50,000 on Wong's head: an amount equivalent to $ in . Wong was known to be against the Japanese invasion of China and to have leftist political sympathies, and he worked for William Randolph Hearst who was famous for saying to his newsmen, \\"You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war\\" in relation to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Another of Wong's photos appeared in Look magazine on December 21, 1937, showing a man bent over a child of perhaps five years of age, both near the crying baby. The man was alleged to be Wong's assistant Taguchi who was arranging the children for best photographic effect. An article in The Japan Times and Mail said the man was a rescue worker who was posing the baby and the boy for the photographer. Wong described the man as the baby's father, coming to rescue his children as the Japanese aircraft returned following the bombing. Japanese propagandists drew a connection between what they claimed was a falsified image and the general news accounts by U.S. and Chinese sources reporting on the fighting in Shanghai, with the aim of discrediting all reports of Japanese atrocities. In 1956, Look magazine's Arthur Rothstein supported his earlier opinion that Wong borrowed the baby and staged the photograph. In 1975, Life magazine featured the famous photo in a picture book, and wrote in the caption, \\"It has been said that this is staged, but it is evident from various points that this is no more than a fabricated rumor.\\" The baby on a stretcher, receiving first aid In 1999, the Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History, a nationalist and denialist group founded by Professor Fujioka Nobukatsu of Tokyo University, published an article entitled \\"Manipulation of Documentary Photos in China: Fanning Flames of Hate in the USA\\" in which Nobukatsu and Sh≈´d≈ç Higashinakano argue that the photograph shows a man setting first one then two children on the railroad tracks for the purpose of making a \\"pitiable sight\\" for American viewers, to ready American citizens for war against Japan. Nobukatsu argues that Wong added smoke to make the image more dramatic, but Rosholt wrote that the train station was still smoking when Wong arrived. Aforementioned Japanese revisionists do not deny the bombing, nor that Chinese civilians were killed and wounded, but claim the presentation of the photograph as a fake allows for the easy interpretation that there are further falsehoods in the historical record. In the article, Nobukatsu and Higashinakano do not mention the additional Wong photo published in Life magazine which shows the baby crying on a medical stretcher as it is given first aid by a Chinese Boy Scout. Wong filmed more newsreels covering Japanese attacks in China, including the Battle of Xuzhou in May 1938 and aerial bombings in Guangzhou in June. He operated under British protection, but continued death threats from Japanese nationalists drove him to leave Shanghai with his family and to relocate to Hong Kong.

Plot With only 100 students accepted at the prestigious Mondonville Music Academy every year, competition to get in is fierce with students numbering in the highest elite in the country. 14-year-old Aristide \\"Alice\\" Lang is a misfit and baffles both the staff and students around him when he becomes the 101st student to be accepted in this year's intake after a personal interview and performance impresses the board. Not only are people shocked by his coveted place as the 101st student but also through the amazing ability he displays during class and practice, even though he can't read music and doesn't know even the most basic chords. However, the answer comes when he picks up a violin and plays a very difficult piece of music from memory both perfectly and passionately. Before Lang was another 101st student who was a child prodigy and grew up to be famous; the piece so expertly performed by Lang was also this man's signature composition. With the help of his violin teacher Yannik Dalberto, he begins to unravel his past which helps him make sense of the future he's being pushed towards. Characters Aristide Lang ‚Äî 14-year- old Aristide came from the countryside to attend Mondonveille Music Academy because of his grandfather's dying wish and also because the professor he admires teaches there. He can't read scores and barely knows the basics, but he possesses great memory and ears, and can play one song perfectly. He's quite energetic and loud, and tends to be an airhead. Victor De Corteau ‚Äî A third-year honor student at Mondonveille and quite famous at school for being a brilliant violinist, though he eventually switched to viola major. He first mistook Alice as a female and tried to hit on him, resulting in the latter punching him (although he seems to get a thrill getting smacked around by Alice). He seems very attached to Alice and looks out for him, even joking that they are in love. Vick seems secretly related to Max somehow and even asks Alice to be Max's rival; in return he will help Alice to find Alice's father's violin. Theophile Maier ‚Äî Theo is Alice's roommate and also the first friend Alice made. Theo is knowledgeable, shy, and kind but is constantly bullied by Richard because their parents are co-workers and don't get along. He usually sits beside Alice in most of their classes, and he is the one that Alice relies on whenever he is in trouble. Theo has a crush on Claire. Maximilien Brant ‚Äî Ranked first for the entrance examination. Though he looks very serious when playing his violin, most of time he's seen with an entirely different personality. Alice commented that he's a space case, sleeping in weird places, not proper and hardly making sense when he talks. Max is no good remembering people's names but he manages to remember Alice's. He was nice enough to help Alice with his song for his periodic concert. Max seems to somehow be related to Victor. Victor comments that Max's technique is number one, but his sound sounds empty. Richard De Diamant ‚Äî He ranked second for the entrance exam and the only one he thinks worthy of being his rival is Max. Richard is extremely arrogant and always tries to put down Alice for his lack of talent. He has an older brother in third year majoring in Cello. Richard admires Victor's talent and view him as a role model. Claire Delna ‚Äî First supporting female character in this manga, Claire is conservative, serious and wields a blunt personality. She first appears when she accidentally knocks Alice in the head with her heavy cello case (a running gag), but instead of caring about Alice, she was more concerned about her cello. She has a habit of making blunt comments with little regard about the other's feelings. Georges Saphir ‚Äî Originally a character from Chigusa's La Esperanca manga but now attending the same school as Alice; he is in third year majoring in piano. Everyone considers him a beauty with his golden hair and green eyes. Release The manga was serialized in Shinshokan's magazine Wings between April 28, 2007, and February 28, 2015. The individual chapters were later published on tank≈çbon format between November 8, 2007, and May 23, 2015. Digital Manga Publishing has released four English-language volumes of the series in North America from June 9, 2010, to June 25, 2014.

It is faceless and strikes a bell in the church tower.  History  There are no known documents that show an exact date when the clock was manufactured, but it is of similar construction to the Exeter Cathedral Clock, the Marston Magna clock in Somerset and the Cotehele clock in Cornwall. A comparison with those clocks makes it likely that it was constructed in the late 15th century. Sometime after 1670, the clock was converted from verge escapement and foliot to a pendulum. For the conversion, the clock was turned upside-down and the release mechanism for the hour strike was adapted to the new positioning of the clock. In 1984, the clock was taken down from the bell tower to the nave of the church, and put on a concrete plinth in a wooden cabinet with glass panes. The moving parts were painted a lurid bright orange, and a minute hand with a 180 degree dial was added. The manual winding spokes were removed and electric winders were installed for both the going and striking train.  Mechanism  The going train sits on top of the clock and the striking train is below. This used to be the other way around, before the clock was converted to have a pendulum. = Frame = The two-post door frame is made from wrought iron. The top and bottom horizontal bars are fixed to the vertical bars by wedged tenon. The frame bars are approximately thick and wide. = Going train = An anchor escapement was fitted to the clock; the date of this conversion is unknown. The escapement arbor turns anti-clockwise. The pendulum theoretically swings once every second, and the escapement wheel (brass) has 20 teeth, so the escapement arbor takes 40 seconds per turn. On the second arbor, the gears consist of an 8-pin birdcage and a 64-teeth wheel, which thus takes 320 seconds per turn. This arbor is probably not original and might date from the conversion to pendulum. This arbor is held by two short brackets that centre approximately to the left of the main frame. The brackets are roughly riveted to the main frame. An 8-pin birdcage engages with 90 teeth on the main wheel, thus taking 3,600 seconds (one hour) per turn. It is likely that the minute hand and dial were fitted after 1971, as they do not appear in Beeson's photo of the clock. The big wheel of the going train is probably the only geared wheel that is original, as it is of the same construction as the wheels of the striking train. = Striking train = Count wheel and locking mechanism The big wheel of the striking train has 48 teeth, which are of rectangular cut with a rounded-off head. An arbor below the big wheel has an 8-pin birdcage and a 24-teeth wheel, making a x6 gear ratio. This arbor has on the outside of the clock frame a balanced metal rod fixed to it which is used for the clock and release of the striking train. The top end of this rod is slightly longer and flattened, whereas the bottom end of the rod is shorter and wider to compensate the weight. Below this second arbor, there is the fly arbor which is connected via an 8-pin birdcage, making a x3 gear ratio. Each turn of the main wheel will turn the fly 18 times. As the main wheel has 8 hour pins, each single hour strike corresponds to 2¬º turns of the fly, which is located at the back of the clock outside the clock frame. Above the big wheel, the count wheel is mounted on the front of the clock outside the clock frame. The count wheel has 78 teeth on the outside, and the 12 notches are on the inside of the count wheel. The main arbor has an 8-tooth pinion which drives the count wheel. This directly reflects the ratio of strikes to lifting pins on the main wheel, as each turn of the count wheel has to produce 78 strikes (the total of numbers 1 through 12). One turn of the count wheel is equal to 9¬æ turns of the big wheel. The big wheel of the striking train turns anti-clockwise, the second arbor with the lock/release rod turns clockwise, and the fly turns anti-clockwise. It appears that most of the wheels of the striking train are original. The count wheel might have been replaced at a later stage, as its construction and execution is different from the other wheels. It is possible that an earlier count wheel only rang the bell once every hour, as this was not unusual for clocks with similar design. = Lock and release mechanism for the striking train = As the clock was turned upside-down when converted to pendulum, the locking mechanism had to be redesigned so that gravity could provide the force for locking the striking train again. A pivot bracket to the top right of the count wheel holds a three-pronged fork-like construction. The left tine of the fork keeps the flail in place. The middle tine of the fork is used to transmit the release from the main arbor of the going train. At the end of the main arbor of the going train, there are two pegs of metal mounted that turn with the main arbor once per hour. The first one is short (approximately ), and the second is longer (approximately ). They are at roughly a 90 degree angle. As the main arbor of the going train turns anti-clockwise, the first, short peg will push the fork up a little, which releases the flail and also moves the lock pin out of the count wheel. The flail turns clockwise until it hits the second, longer peg. This is the warning. A couple of minutes later, as the longer peg moves anti-clockwise, it completely releases the flail, which now turns clockwise whilst the clock strikes. As soon as a notch comes up on the count wheel, the fork dips again, and the left tine of the fork blocks the flail on its next turn. = Bell lever = Slightly below the centre of the main striking arbor, a pivot bracket goes to the left of the mechanism. This holds a lever that is pushed up as the hour pins of the main wheel move upwards. The lever is connected to the bell in the bell tower via a steel wire.

Later, Jake Randle (bass guitar) replaced Aaron Campbell. He Is We initially relied on social networking, using websites such as Myspace and Facebook. In 2009, they were named PureVolume's number one unsigned band of the year. This online presence and the release of an album of old demos in February 2010 led to their signing with Universal Motown Records. Prior to the release of My Forever, He Is We toured with The Rocket Summer. Their debut album My Forever hit number 6 on Billboards Heatseekers Album Charts.

In 2013, their song \\"All About Us\\", with Aaron Gillespie, was included on The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones soundtrack. Despite rumors surfaced of her changing the name of He Is We and moving in a new direction, she insisted that the rumors were completely untrue and she would do no such thing. However, on June 23, 2014, Rachel Taylor broke away as a solo artist with her debut EP, Come Alive.

Acting and the special effects were provided by Chris Bridges. Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Plot Two desperate and young filmmakers stumble upon the ultimate subject, a 33-year-old cannibalistic serial killer named Anthony McAllister, who has agreed to let them document every aspect of his horrifically violent life-style. Initially terrified, the filmmakers get to know Anthony as a person. They even begin to identify with his ecological and philosophical justifications for his cannibalistic lifestyle. It's only when they investigate further that the filmmakers begin to doubt Anthony's accounts of his past. Tensions noticeably rise as the filmmakers continue to confront Anthony on his conflicting stories and ever- changing philosophies. During an awkward interview, the filmmakers interview Merle, the father of a young girl who was abducted and never found. This abduction was Anthony's first child victim. Merle welcomes them into his home and gives them a heart-felt experience that even Anthony is touched by. As the documentary reaches its conclusion, Anthony begins to become uncomfortably aware of the how much of his life he has revealed to these filmmakers. In a final interview with Anthony, a deadly confrontation erupts and all that remains is a broken camera and this footage.

He began his collegiate career with the Virginia Cavaliers before transferring to Richmond. McCurdy was the nation's leading scorer during his senior season of 1974‚Äì75, averaging 32.9 points per game for the Spiders. He became a radio sales and management executive after college. Basketball career =College= Virginia McCurdy was native of Deer Park, New York, attended Deer Park High School and graduated in 1970. He enrolled at the University of Virginia on a basketball scholarship, but in 1970‚Äì71 college freshmen were ineligible to play varsity basketball, so McCurdy had to play on Virginia's freshman team. He led the team in scoring that season, including a season-high 40 points against Maryland's duo of Tom McMillen and Len Elmore. McCurdy then played for one varsity season with the Cavaliers, but Bill Gibson, the coach who had recruited him, left the school. McCurdy decide to transfer school and chose the University of Richmond. Richmond Due to NCAA transfer eligibility rules, McCurdy was forced to sit out for one full year before suiting up for Richmond. In his junior season in 1973‚Äì74, he averaged approximately 24 points per game. McCurdy was the Spiders' second leading scorer behind Aron Stewart, who averaged 26.5 points per game, and was named to the All-Southern Conference Second Team. The following year, the last of his collegiate career, he increased his scoring average to 32.9 per game and led all of Division I in scoring. He scored a total of 855 points that season, and on February 26 (his birthday) he had a career high 53-point outing against Appalachian State. Both the single season and game totals are still school records. Averaging 22.8 field goal attempts per game, the , forward took 35 percent of the team's shots while rarely passing; he was credited with only 11 assists for the season. McCurdy was an All-Southern Conference First Team selection, and the Associated Press named him to their All-America Third Team. In just two seasons at Richmond, he scored 1,347 points. Kevin Eastman, the starting point guard, was in awe at McCurdy's ability to score. Many years later, Eastman was quoted as saying, \\"Looking back now, it was a remarkable feat. [McCurdy] had virtually no quickness. He didn't really have dribbling skills. He couldn't jump that high. He couldn't run real fast. He was a prime example of how will and enthusiasm and effort allowed him to rise to another level.\\" Jokingly, Eastman added, \\"He worked harder than anybody else on the team, but he was very focused on one skill, and that was shooting. I'm not sure I saw him in a defensive stance all year, and the one or two assists that he got were mistakes.\\" =NBA= McCurdy was selected in the eighth round (132nd overall) in the 1975 NBA Draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. He never played a game in the league, however, and it is speculated that the constant cortisone injections into his foot during his senior year may have scared off teams from giving him a chance. Business career With professional basketball out of the picture, McCurdy focused on becoming a successful businessman. Later in life, after admitting to skipping classes while in college to work on his jump shot, he said, \\"I was almost incoherent when I got out of college. Here I was, hoping to be a businessman, and I couldn't even talk basketball.\\" He hired a tutor to catch him back up to speed in statistics. Within a few years he was a successful employee at Katz Radio, becoming the company president in 1990. After Clear Channel purchased Katz Media Group, McCurdy became regional president for Clear Channel Radio Sales. He was named president of the Katz Radio's business division, Katz Marketing Solutions, in 2009. He later joined Beasley Media Group before retiring in April 2020. Personal life McCurdy resided in Westport, Connecticut, with his wife Cindy. They had four children together, including a son, Sean, who was also a successful basketball player. Sean played at St. Anthony High School for Hall of Fame coach Bob Hurley. Sean was a starter for the undefeated and national champion St. Anthony Friars in 2003‚Äì04. He accepted a scholarship to play basketball at Arkansas, but after two seasons transferred to William & Mary to finish his collegiate basketball career. McCurdy was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2018. He filed a medical malpractice case against the Whittingham Cancer Center at Norwalk Hospital. in Norwalk, Connecticut. The suit argued that he was given improper chemotherapy treatment, receiving only 25 percent of the supposed dosage he should have been given of the drugs Fluorouracil and Mitomycin. With his age and compromised immune system, McCurdy became homebound in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He died at age 68 on July 29, 2020, in Connecticut.

It is endemic to Utah County, Utah, where it is known from only one population. It was thought to be extinct until 1981 when this population was discovered. The population contains 5,000 to 10,000 plants on an area of land covering less than 300 acres. It is vulnerable to damage from grazing cattle, which eat the plant and trample the soil, and from development and erosion. This is a federally listed threatened species. This is a perennial herb with a short stem growing from a woody taproot and caudex unit. The leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and are made up of several leaflets up to 1.4 centimeters long. The foliage is coated in silvery-white hairs that make the plant pale in color. The inflorescence is a raceme of 5 to 10 flowers. Each is about 2 centimeters long and pinkish purple with darker tips on the petals. The fruit is a hairy legume pod about a centimeter long. The plant reproduces sexually by seed and cannot reproduce vegetatively. This plant only occurs in the woodlands around Birdseye, Utah. Its numbers are thought to have increased in recent years, and the threats to its existence are not as severe as once reported, so the plant was proposed for removal from the Endangered Species List in 2017.

Although the Inter-Allied Aeronautical Control Commission believed it to be a long-range bomber able to reach New York, archival records of the Imperial German Navy show that Mannesmann designed the triplane as a transport plane, not a bomber.

Description Polystichum vestitum is a terrestrial fern with an erect and scaly rhizome, sometimes forming a short trunk and growing up to 700 mm in height. The fronds are 220‚Äì600 mm long. There are 3‚Äì7 (usually 5) round sori on each pinnule, halfway between the margin and midrib, with a light brown indusium. The ferns are usually bicolour with a dark brown centre that is surrounded by margins that are a pale brown. On the ferns found on the Chatham Islands and the Islands south of New Zealand (Stewart Island and the Sub Antarctic Island) the dark brown centre can be reduced making it less obvious. Closeup of individual prickly shield fern Distribution The fern is native to the three principal islands of New Zealand (North Island, South Island and Stewart Island) and the Chatham Islands, as well as to New Zealand's subantarctic Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands, and to Australia‚Äôs Macquarie Island.Flora of Australia Online. =New Zealand range= The Prickly Shield Fern is found on the North and South Island of New Zealand, however it is not very common north of Auckland or the Coromandel Peninsula in the North Island. =Macquarie Island= On Macquarie it dominates the fernbrake communities which typically occur on the eastern, leeward side of the island on valley slopes and sheltered valley floors. Although it can form dense stands in which few other plants will grow, more commonly it is found in conjunction with Stilbocarpa polaris, Poa foliosa and Pleurophyllum hookeri.Macquarie Island Flora (2010). The fern is seriously affected by rabbit grazing.Bryant & Shaw (2007). Habitat Polystichum vestitum on the North Island is often found covering the hillsides and at higher altitudes where the climate is colder, while on the South Island it can be found in a more various range of places such as both coastal and alpine regions and at lower altitudes. Polystichum vestitum is common in the more exposed landscapes such as gulley floors, forest margins and tussock grasslands, but can also be found in abundance in the more cooler and wetter forests. Life cycle/phenology Polystichum vestitum, just like all other ferns, are non-flowering plants and cannot therefore produce seed. Instead, ferns reproduce with the spores they are carrying on the underside of their fronds. When springtime arrives, the green fern fronds uncoil and uncurl and stretches up. On the underside of the frond, tiny green bumps start to appear and are soon turning brown. These spots are called \\"sori\\" and consist of masses of spore cases, called sporangia. On Polystichum vestitum the spores are monolete and bilaterally symmetrical located which gives them unique identification. When the spores are ripe, the sporangia is torn apart and the light-weighted spores are carried away with the wind. The spore can remain fertile for many years and go on a journey for hundreds of kilometers. For the spores to be able to start growing, it must fall into wet ground. A spore that falls into dry land, will never begin to grow, since it needs to absorb water. Once the spore has settled down it can start absorbing water through osmosis, which enables swelling and bursting of the outer walls of the spore and the growing tissue can be released. The one spore cell can now divide into two and continue to develop into a small heart-shaped object called ‚Äòprothallus‚Äô, which looks very similar to a liverwort and can therefore be mistaken for it. On the underside of the prothallus, the male reproductive organs are located, while the female ones are at the top. The male sex organs are called antheridia and the female ones are called archegonia. When the sperm and the egg has matured and there is enough moisture on the prothallus, the antheridia release the spermatozoa which is attracted by the scent coming from the ripened egg and swims towards it to fertilize it. Once fertilized, the cell can divide and the new baby fern starts to grow with help from the prothallus, which supports it with nutrients. After a while when the fern has established its own root system and can continue growing on its own, the prothallus dies. A new life cycle can now begin when the fern grows towards maturity. Diet/prey/predators =Diet and foraging= The Prickly Shield Fern prefers soil that is free draining (does not get waterlogged) and is fertile enriched with humus. The fern can survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. It prefers areas with more rainfall and can survive in temperature below 0oc however in these conditions the ferns are more often found under the forest canopy where it will be a bit warmer. It prefers wetter areas and is why it can often be fund in gully's however it does like the soil to be free draining rather than waterlogged. =Predators, parasites, and diseases= On the underside of the fronds in silk tunnels, the tiny caterpillar of the \\"puniu spore-eater\\" moth can be found living and eating the spores from the fern. There are also caterpillars from the \\"pale fern looper\\" and \\"zigzag fern looper\\" moth that feed on the fronds. The plant is also favored by deer and possums. In general, aphids, brown fern scale, caterpillars, mealy bug, slugs and snails are the most commonly parasites to attack ferns. Other problems and diseases could be acid rot, algae, fungus diseases and moulding. Other information The Prickly Shield Fern is in a large abundance and its current conservation status is not threatened and has been for the past 14 years. The etymology of Polystichum comes from the Greek words polus and stikhos, which can be translated as \\"many rows\\" and can be referred to the parallel rows of spore cases on the underside of the fronds. Vestitum has its origins from the Latin vestire and means \\"clothed\\", which denotes from the dense cover of the scales on its leaf stalks.

Carol was also the strongest storm of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season and the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the 1938 New England hurricane. Carol is also the first named storm to attain Category 5 status. Carol developed on August 28 off the west coast of Africa, although the Weather Bureau did not initiate advisories until five days later. On September 2, Carol attained hurricane status, based on a ship report. It moved northwestward, attaining peak winds of 160 mph (260 km/h), based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. After weakening, it brushed Bermuda and turned northeastward near New England, passing west of Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John, New Brunswick on September 7\\\\. While crossing Atlantic Canada, Carol became an extratropical cyclone, which dissipated on September 9 southwest of Greenland. When Carol initially threatened to strike Bermuda, several planes were evacuated from the island. Later, the hurricane produced high waves along the New England coastline which, in combination with foggy conditions, caused several boating accidents. At least 40 people required rescue, and four people were killed. Although winds in the region were minor, fishing damage totaled about $1 million (1953 USD, $ USD). In Nova Scotia, hurricane-force wind gusts downed trees and power lines, as well as heavy damage to the apple crop totaling $1 million (1950 CAD, $ USD). High waves washed several boats ashore, and also killed one person. Ferry travel was halted across Atlantic Canada, although impact was less severe outside of Nova Scotia. In Prince Edward Island, gusty winds caused isolated power outages, and minor flooding occurred in New Brunswick. Meteorological history In late August, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa, developing into a tropical depression developed near Cape Verde on August 28\\\\. It moved west- southwestward for two days before turning to the west. The depression is estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm on August 31, and subsequently it turned to the west-northwest. On September 2, the S.S. Umatilla reported winds up to force 12 on the Beaufort scale, or hurricane strength; the ship also reported very high seas and a rapidly decreasing pressure. Based on the report, the Miami Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Hurricane Carol about 750 miles (1200 km) east-northeast of Barbados. After reaching hurricane status, Carol embarked a steady intensification trend as it moved northwestward. On September 3, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the storm and reported winds of 160 mph (260 km/h), along with a minimum pressure of 929 mbar. This made Carol the strongest storm of the season. At its peak, the maximum winds were in an area in diameter across the center. The hurricane maintained peak winds for about a day before beginning to weaken. Early on September 6, Carol passed about southwest of Bermuda with winds of about . The next day the hurricane turned to the north- northeast, bypassing Cape Cod by about . Late on September 7, Carol brushed western Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John, New Brunswick with winds of around . Shortly after making landfall, Carol transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which crossed the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, eastern Quebec, and Labrador before dissipating southwest of Greenland on September 9\\\\. Preparations and impact Rainfall from Carol in New England As Carol was threatening Bermuda, planes flew away from the island and ships returned to harbor for safety. Although hurricane-force winds were initially predicted, Carol only brushed the island with high waves and gale-force winds. The winds toppled a few trees and power lines, and also injured two motorcyclists after they lost control of their vehicles. Along the East Coast of the United States, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from New Jersey through Maine due to the approaching hurricane. The combination of high waves and foggy conditions caused several boating accidents in New England, killing four people and left at least 40 people in need of Coast Guard rescue. Winds across much of the region were not significant, reaching only on Nantucket. Across southeast Maine, Carol produced at least of rainfall, which was beneficial due to gardeners and trees due to previously dry conditions. Effects were generally minimal in the state, although the rainfall prompted the cancellation of a few Northeast Airlines flights. The hurricane caused moderate damage to the fishing industry in New England, totaling around $1 million (1953 USD, $ USD). In the Grand Banks of Canada, the threat of the hurricane prompted fishing boats to venture back to port. In the Bay of Fundy, foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground. Across Nova Scotia, rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth, a schooner near Halifax, four yachts in Chester, and another three boats in Shelburne ashore. In addition, eleven yachts in Chester sank during the storm. The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect, destroying a garage. In Cow Bay, a man drowned after falling off of a yacht. Rough seas halted ferry service between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, as well as between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; other ferry service across the region were delayed. As Carol moved through eastern Canada, it dropped light to moderate rainfall along its path, peaking at 4.33 inches (110 mm) in the C√¥te-Nord region of eastern Quebec, along the northern coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Strong winds affected much of the region, primarily Nova Scotia, including an 80 mph (129 km/h) gust in Halifax. Across the province, the combination of winds and rain downed the equivalent of about 500,000 ft3 (14,000 m3) of trees, most of which in areas where some trees were already cut. The winds blew trees onto power lines, leaving widespread areas without telephone, telegraph, or power. In Annapolis Valley, strong winds heavily damaged the apple and grain crop, with farms experiencing losses up to 50%. Losses from the apple crop was estimated around $1 million (1950 CAD, $ USD). Strong winds left some property damage, including broken windows and at least one instance of a blown-off roof. Across the province, Carol left several people injured. Outside of Nova Scotia, the winds from Carol were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Brunswick. Light rainfall, peaking at 2.44 inches (62 mm) in the province, caused street flooding in Moncton. The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario, and as far east as Prince Edward Island, where rainfall reached 1.73 inches (44 mm). Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed some trees, resulting in minor power outages. Further north in Quebec, adverse conditions from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash.

He was captured and tortured for months after the fall of the country to Imperial Japan, but managed to convince the Japanese that he was a civilian and was released. Employed by the Japanese Fourteenth Army (though still under suspicion), he gathered and passed along valuable information to the Philippine resistance. He also planned and participated in the mass escape of about 500 Filipino prisoners. Early life Sakakida was born and raised in Hawaii. He was a Nisei, the youngest of four children of Japanese immigrant parents. He was recruited into the U.S. Army in March 1941, while America was still a neutral in World War II. Fluent in Japanese, he was sworn in as a sergeant and was one of the first two Japanese Americans to be assigned to the Corps of Intelligence Police (the other being fellow Nisei Arthur Komori), which became the Counterintelligence Corps shortly after America's entry in the war. After intensive training, on April 7, 1941, he and Komori set sail for the Philippines, then an American possession, aboard the . Upon their arrival in Manila, they were assigned to spy on the Japanese community in the city, posing as merchant sailors who had jumped ship. World War II After the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, Sakakida was rounded up by the Philippine Constabulary and eventually ended up in Bilibid Prison, still maintaining his cover as a civilian, but he was recognized and released. He joined the American retreat, first to Bataan, then to Corregidor. His duties involved translating documents and interrogating Japanese prisoners of war. The situation on Corregidor being hopeless, Sakakida and Komori were eventually ordered to fly out on one of the last evacuation aircraft. Sakakida persuaded his superiors to let attorney Clarence Yamagata take his seat; Sakakida was unmarried, while Yamagata had a wife and children living in Japan and his pro-American activities had been more public. The airplane left on April 13, 1942, and managed to avoid Japanese interception. Sakakida accompanied General Jonathan Wainwright as his interpreter during the surrender negotiations. After the surrender of Corregidor in early May, \\"Sakakida became the only Japanese-American to be captured by the Japanese forces in the Philippines.\\" By Japanese law, he was considered to be a Japanese citizen because of his ancestry, and was charged with treason. The Kempeitai (military police) interrogated and tortured him for two months, but were unable to shake his story that he was a civilian who had worked for the U.S. Army under duress. Sakakida's mother had taken the precaution of voiding his Japanese citizenship at the Japanese consulate in Hawaii in August 1941, and the charge of treason was dropped. He spent nearly a year in one prison after another, before his case was reviewed in February 1943 by Colonel Nishiharu, Chief Judge Advocate of Fourteenth Army Headquarters. Nishiharu concluded Sakakida was most likely innocent, and hired him in March as a staff translatorNisei Linguists: Japanese Americans in the Military Intelligence Service During World War II, James C. McNaughton. p. 458 and personal houseboy. However, he periodically faced devious attempts to trick him into betraying himself. Despite this, security was lax, and Sakakida was often left alone with sensitive military documents, some of which he proceeded to memorize or steal. When a woman showed up at the Judge Advocate General's office to obtain a pass to visit her imprisoned guerrilla leader husband, Ernest Tupas, Sakakida took the risk of revealing his true identity to her. Mrs. Tupas put him in touch with the Philippine resistance, to whom he passed information. He also devised a plan for a mass escape for Tupas and other Filipino prisoners. On a night in October 1943, it was set in motion. Sakakida posed as a Japanese officer and led a band of guerrillas into the prison at Muntinglupa. After knocking out or overpowering the unsuspecting guards, the rescuers freed nearly 500 inmates. Sakakida returned to his quarters with no one the wiser. According to the Associated Press 1996 obituary of Sakakida, three former guerrillas, including a Roman Catholic priest, claimed that he \\"fabricated his role in the escape.\\" Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii responded that \\"Sakakida's story has 'been confirmed time and time again.'\\" In December 1944, Sakakida decided that the time had finally come to flee. He hid in the jungle, cut off from any news. The war had been over for weeks when he made contact with Americans soldiers in September 1945.Nisei Linguists, James C. McNaughton. p. 459 Post-war Sakakida returned to the Counterintelligence Corps and was promoted to master sergeant. He testified at the war crimes trial of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, as he had been an interpreter in the office of the general's Judge Advocate. He remained in Manila for eighteen months, working on war crime investigations; he encountered some of his former torturers, whom he forgave.Nisei Linguists, James C. McNaughton. p. 460 He was commissioned in 1947. He married Cherry M. Kiyosaki of Maui on September 25, 1948. He transferred to the United States Air Force and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. After retiring in 1975, he lived in Fremont, California. He died of lung cancer on January 23, 1996. He was survived by his wife. Awards and honors For his accomplishments, he was awarded the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star and two Commendation Medals, and was inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame. He also received four medals from the Philippine government, including the Philippine Legion of Honor (degree of Legionnaire), presented to him by Ambassador Raul Rabe at a ceremony at the Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C. on April 15, 1994. Despite efforts to have Sakakida awarded the Medal of Honor, the Army refused to consider it on the grounds that a statute required that a recommendation be filed by 1951 at the latest. Senator Akaka introduced legislation to waive this condition. On February 17, 1999, the senator announced that Sakakida had been posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

This project includes a security management information system, a criminal information system, an exit and entry administration information system, a supervisor information system, a traffic management information system, among others. The Golden Shield Project is one of the 12 important \\"golden\\" projects. The other \\"golden\\" projects are Golden Bridges (for public economic information), Golden Customs (for foreign trades), Golden Card (for electronic currencies), Golden Finance (for financial management), Golden Agriculture (for agricultural information), Golden Taxation (for taxation), Golden Water (for water conservancy information) and Golden Quality (for quality supervision). The Golden Shield Project also manages the Bureau of Public Information and Network Security Supervision, which is a bureau that is widely believed, though not officially claimed, to operate a subproject called the Great Firewall of China (GFW) which is a censorship and surveillance project that blocks politically inconvenient incoming data from foreign countries. It is operated by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the government of China. This subproject was initiated in 1998 and began operations in November 2003. It has also seemingly been used to attack international web sites using Man-on-the-side DDoS, for example GitHub on 2015/03/28. History The political and ideological background of the Golden Shield Project is considered to be one of Deng Xiaoping's favorite sayings in the early 1980s: \\"If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.\\" The saying is related to a period of economic reform in China that became known as the \\"socialist market economy\\". Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, the reform led China towards a market economy and opened up the market for foreign investors. Nonetheless, despite the economic freedom, values and political ideas of the Communist Party of China have had to be protected by \\"swatting flies\\" of other unwanted ideologies.R. MacKinnon \\"Flatter world and thicker walls? Blogs, censorship and civic discourse in China\\" Public Choice (2008) 134: p. 31‚Äì46, Springer The Internet in China arrived in 1994, as the inevitable consequence of and supporting tool for the \\"socialist market economy\\". As availability of the Internet has gradually increased, it has become a common communication platform and tool for trading information. The Ministry of Public Security took initial steps to control Internet use in 1997, when it issued comprehensive regulations governing its use. The key sections, Articles 46, are the following: In 1998, the Communist Party of China feared that the China Democracy Party (CDP) would breed a powerful new network that the party elites might not be able to control.Goldman, Merle Goldman. Gu, Edward X. [2004] (2004). Chinese Intellectuals between State and Market. Routledge publishing. The CDP was immediately banned, followed by arrests and imprisonment. That same year, the Golden Shield project was started. The first part of the project lasted eight years and was completed in 2006. The second part began in 2006 and ended in 2008. On 6 December 2002, 300 people in charge of the Golden Shield project from 31 provinces and cities throughout China participated in a four-day inaugural \\"Comprehensive Exhibition on Chinese Information System\\".È¶ñÂ±Ü„Äå2002Âπ¥‰∏≠ÂúãÂ§ßÂûãÊ©üÊßã‰ø°ÊÅØÂåñÂ±ïË¶ΩÊúÉ„ÄçÂÖ®Âúã31ÁúÅÂ∏ÇÈáëÁõæÂ∑•Á®ãÈ†òÂ∞éÈõ≤ÈõÜ At the exhibition, many western high-tech products, including Internet security, video monitoring and human face recognition were purchased. It is estimated that around 30,000-50,000 police are employed in this gigantic project. A subsystem of the Golden Shield has been nicknamed \\"the Great Firewall\\" (Èò≤ÁÅ´ÈïøÂüé) (a term that first appeared in a Wired magazine article in 1997) in reference to its role as a network firewall and to the ancient Great Wall of China. This part of the project includes the ability to block content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewalls and proxy servers at the six Internet gateways. The system also selectively engages in DNS cache poisoning when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical. Because of its disconnection from the larger world of IP routing protocols, the network contained within the Great Firewall has been described as \\"the Chinese autonomous routing domain\\". During the 2008 Summer Olympics, Chinese officials told Internet providers to prepare to unblock access from certain Internet caf√©s, access jacks in hotel rooms and conference centers where foreigners were expected to work or stay.  Actions and purpose  The Golden Shield Project contains an integrated, multi-layered system, involving technical, administrative, public security, national security, publicity and many other departments. This project was planning to finish within five years, separated into two phases. = Phase I = The first phase of the project focused on the construction of the first-level, second-level, and the third- level information communication network, application database, shared platform, etc. The period was three years. According to the Xinhua News Agency, since September 2003, the Public Security department of China has recorded 96% of the population information of mainland China into the database. In other words, the information of 1.25 billion out of 1.3 billion people has recorded in the information database of the Public Security department of China. Within three years, phase I project has finished the first-level, second-level, and the third-level backbone network and access network. This network has covered public security organs at all levels. The grass-roots teams of public security organs have accessed to the backbone network with the coverage rate 90%, that is to say, every 100 police officers have 40 computers connected to the network of the phase I project. The Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China said that the phase I project had significantly enhanced the combat effectiveness of public security. Members participated in the phase I project include Tsinghua University from China, and some high-tech companies from the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Israel, etc. Cisco Systems from the United States of America has provided massive hardware devices for this project, and therefore was criticized by some members of the United States Congress. According to China Central Television, phase I cost 6.4 billion yuan. On , there came the \\"2002 China Large Institutions Informationization Exhibition\\", 300 leaders from the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China and from other public security bureaus of 31 provinces or municipalities attended the exhibition. There were many western high-tech products, including network security, video surveillance and face recognition. It was estimated that about 30000 police officers have been employed to maintain the system. There was a multi-level system to track netizens violating the provisions. Netizens who want to use the internet in a cybercaf√© are required to show their Resident Identity Cards. If some violating event happened, the owner of the cybercaf√© can send the personal information to the police through the internet. It is called a public security automation system, but it is actually an integrated, multi-layered, internet blocking and monitoring system, involving the technical, administrative, public security, national security, publicity, etc. The features are known as: readable, listenable, and thinkable. = Phase II = The phase II project started in 2006. The main task was to enhance the terminal construction, and the public security business application system, trying to informatize of the public security work. The period was two years. Based on the phase I project, phase II project expanded the information application types of public security business, and informationized further public security information. The key points of this project included application system construction, system integration, the expansion of information centre, and information construction in central and western provinces. The system of was planning to strengthen the integration, to share and analysis of information. It would greatly enhance the information for the public security work support. Censored content Mainland Chinese Internet censorship programs have censored Web sites that include (among other things): * Web sites belonging to \\"outlawed\\" or suppressed groups, such as pro-democracy activists and Falun Gong. * News sources that often cover topics that are considered defamatory against China, such as police brutality, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, freedom of speech, democracy sites. These sites include Voice of America and the Chinese edition of BBC News. * Sites related to the Taiwanese government, media, or other organizations, including sites dedicated to religious content, and most large Taiwanese community websites or blogs. * Web sites that contain anything the Chinese authorities regard as obscenity or pornography. * Web sites relating to criminal activity. * Sites linked with the Dalai Lama, his teachings or the International Tibet Independence Movement. * Most blogging sites experience frequent or permanent outages. * Web sites deemed as subversive. Blocked web sites are indexed to a lesser degree, if at all, by some Chinese search engines. This sometimes has considerable impact on search results. According to The New York Times, Google has set up computer systems inside China that try to access Web sites outside the country. If a site is inaccessible, then it is added to Google China's blacklist. However, once unblocked, the Web sites will be reindexed. Referring to Google's first-hand experience of the great firewall, there is some hope in the international community that it will reveal some of its secrets. Simon Davies, founder of London-based pressure group Privacy International, is now challenging Google to reveal the technology it once used at China's behest. \\"That way, we can understand the nature of the beast and, perhaps, develop circumvention measures so there can be an opening up of communications.\\" \\"That would be a dossier of extraordinary importance to human rights,\\" Davies says. Google has yet to respond to his call.Will Google's help breach the great firewall of China?

This prevents their content from going through the Great Firewall of China; however, it requires companies to apply for local ICP licenses. * Onion routing and Garlic routing, such as I2P or Tor, can be used. * Freegate, Ultrasurf, and Psiphon are free programs that circumvent the China firewall using multiple open proxies, but still behave as though the user is in China. * VPNs (virtual private network) and SSH (secure shell) are the powerful and stable tools for bypassing surveillance technologies. They use the same basic approaches, proxies and encrypted channels, used by other circumvention tools, but depend on a private host, a virtual host, or an account outside of China, rather than open, free proxies. * Open application programming interface (API) used by Twitter which enables to post and retrieve tweets on sites other than Twitter. \\"The idea is that coders elsewhere get to Twitter, and offer up feeds at their own URLs‚Äîwhich the government has to chase down one by one.\\" says Jonathan Zittrain, co-director of Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\\"Leaping the Great Firewall of China \\", Emily Parker, Wall Street Journal, 24 March 2010.

Differences from the Great Firewall  The Golden Shield Project is distinct from the Great Firewall (GFW), which has a different mission. The differences are listed below: Politically, # The GFW is a tool for the propaganda system, whereas the Golden Shield Project is a tool for the public security system. # The original requirements of the GFW are from the 610 office, whereas the original requirements of the Golden Shield Project are from the public security department. # The GFW is a national gateway for filtering foreign websites, whereas the Golden Shield Project is for monitoring the domestic internet. Technically, # The GFW is attached to the three national internet exchange centres, and then spread to some of the ISPs to implement the blocking effect, whereas the Golden Shield Project stations in the most exchange centres and data centres. # The GFW is very powerful in scientific research, including many information security scientists, such as people from Harbin Institute of Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, whereas the Golden Shield Project is less powerful in scientific research. # The GFW is built by Fang Binxing, whereas the Golden Shield Project is built by Shen Changxiang.

He was the first British or Commonwealth military pilot to use a parachute, in a test. While serving as a test pilot, he crashed to his death in a captured German fighter. Early life Collett was born in Blenheim, New Zealand on 28 August 1886. His father, Horace Edwin Collett, lived at Lambeth, London, England. His mother, Alice Marguerite Radford, the senior Collett's wife, resided in Tauranga. After completing his education at Queen's College in Tauranga, Clive Collett chose a career in engineering. First World War Collett was in Britain when the First World War broke out. He joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1914. He earned his Royal Aero Club Pilot's Certificate number 1057 at a private flying school on 29 January 1915. He was transferred to Brooklands on 17 February. Two months later, he was commissioned. On 25 May, he joined No. 11 Squadron RFC. On 6 July, he was hospitalized for an injury suffered in an aircraft mishap at Hendon. On 30 July, he was posted to No. 8 Squadron RFC at Netheravon, Wiltshire. Collett pulled an on-base transfer to join No. 32 Squadron RFC on 1 March 1916; however, he was then posted to No. 18 Squadron RFC on 9 March 1916 as a Vickers FB.5 pilot. After a month's service, he was admitted to hospital on 18 April with a broken nose, and returned to Home Establishment in England via the merchant ship Delta. On 13 June 1916, he was posted to the Experimental Station at Orfordness, Suffolk as a test pilot. His duties there included undertaking the British military's first parachute jump from an aeroplane, a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2c, during January 1917. Source is a chronology that lists no earlier jumps from airplanes. On 24 July 1917, he joined No. 70 Squadron RFC, which had just upgraded to Sopwith Camels. As a Captain, he was a Flight Commander. Three days later, he destroyed a German Albatros D.V over Ypres for his first victory. He would win six more victories in August. Collett was accounted an aggressive pilot by fellow ace James McCudden, who noted that Collett \\"...used to come back shot to ribbons nearly every time he went out.\\" Collett himself noted in his combat reports an incident when he continued to fire on a crashed German plane. On 5 September 1917, Collett destroyed another Albatros D.V over Roulers. Four days later, he scored a victory in each of three separate dogfights spread over three-quarters of an hour. He was also wounded in the hand, most probably by Ludwig Hanstein of Jasta 35. Collett was removed from combat. While recuperating, he was awarded the Military Cross on 26 September 1917. A Bar followed shortly thereafter, on 18 October 1917. When recovered, Collett was assigned to No. 73 Squadron RFC as they prepared their Camels for combat. On 23 December 1917, Collett was test-flying a captured German Albatros over the Firth of Forth, which inexplicably dived into the sea. He was buried in grave K903 in Comely Bank Cemetery in Edinburgh.

Season 1 =Ryan: The Family Favorite= First aired: 22 March 2009 The victim for the series premier is named Alan, a man who gets bullied by his bigger younger brother. In his tape, Alan explains that Ryan gets away with bullying him because he is the family favorite. He also states that in the past Ryan pushed him down a flight of stairs and put his head through a wall. Another victim named Nick appears in the tape and accuses Ryan of humiliating him and giving him a scar on the forehead by pushing him down some bleachers. Ryan accepts Mayhem's challenge to fight an MMA fighter. Mayhem brings Ryan to his gym and decides to let Ryan punch him in the head (which he describes as annoying but not painful). After watching Ryan in the gym he decides to put Ryan up against Tony 'The Gun' Bonello. Ryan was tapped out three times in the first round; first for a rear naked choke, and then twice more for two consecutive guillotine chokes. In the second round, he was KO'd after a kick in the gut. After the fight Alan and Ryan hug and Ryan apologizes which Alan seems to accept. *Bully: Ryan :Height: 6' (note: see weight below) :Weight: 200 lbs.

In addition to the money, Mayhem adds the additional stipulation that if Vince loses, he has to move out. He shows up to train at Mayhem's gym, during which he falls down after kicking Mayhem's bag, which causes Mayhem to laugh. He shows up to the fight and learns that his opponent will be former NFL wide receiver Michael Westbrook. During the first round, Vince tapped out four times in the first round, and was KO'd in the second round. He apologizes to Adam and Josh after the fight, but says in an interview afterwards that he will not be paying them the back rent, as the $9,000 they have just won will cover it. Adam notes that he will need a new roommate since Vince will be moving out, and asks Josh if he would like to move in with him, which Josh accepts. *Bully: Vince Carosso :Height: 6'7\\" :Weight: 236 lbs. *Fighter: Michael Westbrook :Height: 6'3\\" :Weight: 223 lbs. *Victim(s): Josh and Adam (bully's current and former roommate respectively) *Money earned by Bully: $1,000 *Money earned by victim(s): $9,000 *Original airing: Sunday, 29 March 2010 =Christian: The Angry Couch Potato= First aired 5 April 2009 Mayhem helps out Cameron and Brian, by dropping Conor \\"Hurricane\\" Heun in the cage with Christian, a lazy, couch potato with a thirst for the pain of others. *Bully: Christian :Height: :Weight: *Fighter: Conor \\"Hurricane\\" Heun :Height: 5'10 :Weight: *Victim(s): Brian and Cameron *Money earned by Bully: $0 *Money earned by victim(s): $10,000($5,000 each.) *Original airing: =Jonathan: The Rollerblade Bully= First aired 12 April 2009 Mayhem Miller helps Sergio and Thomas with Jonathan, a self-proclaimed \\"aggressive in-line skater,\\" who thinks he has the right to pick on weaker people in the neighborhood, by putting him in the ring with MMA champion Jake Shields to teach him a lesson he won't soon forget. *Bully: Jonathan :Height: :Weight: 175 lbs *Fighter: Jake Shields :Height: 5'11 :Weight: *Victim(s): Sergio and Thomas *Money earned by Bully: $2000 *Money earned by victim(s): $8000 *Original airing: 12 April 2009 =Eriq: The Bum Rapper= First aired 19 April 2009 Mayhem Miller helps Eriq's ex-girlfriend Linda, by putting him in the ring with MMA champion Jon \\"Man of Faith\\" Murphy.

The on-site doctor found no such injury, and Linda states that Eriq frequently uses a shoulder injury claim when he fears losing a fight.

The FFV was inaugurated on May 11, 1889, and ran until May 12, 1968; this was the longest running C&O; named passenger train. The train operated on a daily daytime schedule, being carried from Jersey City, NJ‚ÄîPenn Station in Manhattan was years in the future‚Äîas a Pennsylvania Railroad train to Washington, D.C. (after 1908 to Washington Union Station) and, as a C&O; train, from there to Cincinnati, OH (after 1933 calling at the Union Terminal). The train operated westbound as #3 and eastbound as #4. The train ran behind C&O; locomotives beyond Washington, DC, first to Alexandria, VA over trackage rights from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac to Alexandria, VA, there changing to tracks of the Southern Railway (now part of Norfolk Southern). In Orange, VA, C&O; trains left Southern property to turn onto what is now a transfer track between Orange and Gordonsville, VA, but this track was originally part of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, which continued through Gordonsville on to Charlottesville. This segment of track became part of the C&O;, as did the track through Gordonsville, which before becoming part of the C&O; was the Virginia Central Railroad. Northeast of Orange, portions of the Orange and Alexandria railroad became part of the Southern; the present-day Norfolk Southern tracks between Orange and Charlottesville were built after the Civil War. When the FFV was new, the transfer track from Southern property at Orange joined the C&O; main line from Newport News, VA at Gordonsville, and proceeded on them to Charlottesville. About a mile west of the C&O; station in Charlottesville, the C&O; tracks crossed the Southern line. The Southern station was, and is, a union station, with platforms for both main lines; a few C&O; trains, but not seemingly the FFV, stopped at both stations. From Charlottesville, the FFV continued west over the Blue Ridge Mountains and North Mountain to West Virginia, along the New River Gorge, and finally crossing the Ohio River into Ohio at Cincinnati. (The \\"Ohio\\" of \\"Chesapeake and Ohio\\" is the river, not the state.) Major station stops included Alexandria, VA, Charlottesville, VA, Charleston, WV, Huntington, WV, Ashland, KY, and Cincinnati, OH. Charlottesville, besides being a junction point for all traffic going to or coming from Washington, was also where the FFV from Washington and an extension of the train from Newport News were combined. This separate section was labeled in timetables as #43 westbound or #44 eastbound. The Fast Flying Virginian operated alongside the later George Washington and the Sportsman, being one of the C&O;'s most prestigious passenger trains and at the outset a prestigious train absolutely. It was the first train in the C&O; system to operate with a dining car, and the original consist of the FFV was one of the first trains in the country to feature cars with enclosed \\"vestibules\\", enabling safe and convenient passage from car to car. Unfortunately for the FFV, and the majority of American railroads, passenger trains become less popular over time, as the public embraced the automobile and the airplane. By the mid-1960s, the C&O;, like other railroads, depended on mail and express packages to keep passenger trains marginally profitable (while being able to claim, thanks to the accounting rules, that passenger trains lost money). In 1967, when the U.S. Postal Service canceled all their mail contracts with the railroads, the C&O; like all railroads really was losing money on passenger operations. This spelled the end of the FFV, which made its final run on May 12, 1968. Actually, it spelled the end for privately operated passenger service in the US, to be replaced by Amtrak, which came in existence almost exactly two years after the FFV made its last run. Amtrak's thrice-weekly train called the Cardinal (##50 and 51), follows the route of the FFV from New York Penn Station to Cincinnati via Washington, D.C. before continuing on to Chicago, IL via Indianapolis, IN. The 23 October 1890 wreck of the FFV, near Hinton, West Virginia, was immortalized in the folk ballad \\"Engine One-Forty-Three.\\"  References   External links  * Chesapeake and Ohio Historical Society Category:Railway services introduced in 1889 Category:Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Category:Named passenger trains of the United States Category:Passenger rail transportation in Kentucky Category:Passenger rail transportation in Ohio Category:Passenger rail transportation in Virginia Category:Passenger rail transportation in Washington, D.C.

While at Penn, he served as a research engineer and on the committee whose focus was investigating the question of sabbatical leave. In the 1960s, Kane devised a method for formulating equations of motion for complex mechanical systems that requires less labor and leads to simpler equations than the classical approaches, while avoiding the vagueness of virtual quantities.

She is also co-founder and current CEO of the company Global Thermostat. Background and education Chichilnisky was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. After a military coup, the Argentine military violently closed scientific faculties at the University of Buenos Aires on July 29, and she left Argentina for the United States, Supported by a fellowship from the Ford Foundation,. Chichilnisky matriculated in the doctoral program in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology although without an undergraduate degree; she moved to the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, and completed her Ph.D. in mathematics there in 1970, under the supervision of Jerrold E. Marsden. She earned a second Ph.D. in economics in 1976 under the supervision of G√©rard Debreu. Career After a postdoctoral position at Harvard University, she accepted a position as an associate professor at Columbia University in 1977, and received tenure there in 1979, and was named UNESCO Professor of Mathematics and Economics from 1995 to 2008. She also held a chair in economics at the University of Essex from 1980 to 1981, and has additionally been a visiting professor at other universities including at Stanford in 2017. In 2010 Chichilnisky, together with Peter Eisenberger and Edgar Bronfman Jr.. formed Global Thermostat, a company that specializes in Direct air capture from a unit that extracts carbon dioxide directly from air. Research Chichilnisky is the author of over 17 books and over 330 scientific research papers. She is best known for proposing and designing the carbon credit emissions trading market underlying the Kyoto Protocol which was international law since 2005, and was a lead author on the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that won the 2007 Nobel Prize. In the theory of international trade, she constructed an example of a \\"transfer paradox\\", where a transfer of goods from a donor to a recipient can render the recipient worse off and the donor better off. She constructed examples where export-led growth strategies for developing countries could result in paradoxically poor results, because of increasing returns to scale in the technologies of the developed countries. In welfare economics and voting theory, particularly in the specialty of social choice theory, Chichilnisky introduced a continuous model of collective decisions to which she applied algebraic topology; following her initiatives, continuous social choice has developed as an international subdiscipline. During the 1980s and 1990s some of Chichilnisky's research was done in collaboration with mathematical economist Geoffrey M. Heal, who has been her colleague at Essex and Columbia. Litigation In 1994 Chichilnisky sued two other economics professors, accusing them of stealing her ideas. Chichilnisky was countersued and dropped her lawsuit. The subject matter of the controversy was described in contemporaneous news reports as \\"distinctly small-time stuff, at least according to most experts.\\" . Reprinted by the Chicago Tribune, May 6, 2006.

Turnstyle  Kerimofski's first band Turnstyle achieved a degree of success in 1999 with the single \\"Spray Water on the Stereo\\", reaching No. 16 on the ARIA Singles Charts. The band formed in 1995 and went on an 8-year hiatus in 2002. Reforming first in 2010 and again in 2013, the band has permanently reunited and after releasing the album Time Equals Function in 2015 (produced by Kerimofski), have played several shows and released a follow up Happy Factories, released on 1 December 2018. When asked about the new release in a conversation with The West Australian, Kerimofski described it as \\"going to be oddball in parts but a bit more contemporary in sound\\". The band trickled short clips from the album on their Facebook page leading up to the album's release. The band is currently on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia geographically separating its members.  Mitey Ko  Kerimofski joined the duo of poet/activist Allan Boyd and WASO cellist/author Kevin Gillam in 2000 as a percussionist and keyboard player. In 2002, the band's music was the featured musical component of the independent film Teesh and Trude starring Peter Phelps and Susie Porter. Mitey Ko released 4 albums, all featuring Kerimofski.  The Burton Cool Suit  A band Kerimofski once described as \\"a mix of indie rock and 60s garage rock\\", existed between 2003 and 2007. At the behest of some band members Kerimofski abandoned much of his past influences for the band's first release instead taking a more retro approach. The Burton Cool Suit supported Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks on their 2005 Australian tour as well as a varied list of other supports including The Buzzcocks, Idlewild and Youthgroup.The band's second album reintroduced some of Kerimofski's earlier influences by which time he had effectively annulled the band. In an interview with Perth Music Journalist Bob Gordon he said, \\"I felt like I was not making music for myself but for the people who still thought it was 1966, it just wasn't me. The last straw was when The Stems reneged on a promise of us supporting their Australian tour and I told them to go fuck themselves\\". The song 'SQ' was nominated for a WAM Song of the Year award in 2007. In July 2016 The Burton Cool Suit albums were digitally re-released by revered Australian independent record label Half A Cow. To commemorate the release the band performed two shows in October 2016.  The Community Chest  After releasing a well received solo album in 2010, Kerimofski formed the Community Chest featuring close friends, his wife Dee and Turnstyle producer Laurie Sinagra, winner of numerous West Australian Music Industry Awards. Originally formed to perform Adem's solo material, the band forged their own identity and eventually recorded a debut album, which was released in July 2013 on vinyl format. The band released an EP \\"Make Your Decision Now And Live With It Forever\\" in October 2015 which further explored Kerimofski's interest in drones, repetition and rural futurism. Self-produced, the EP was mastered by Stereolab producer Paul Tipler in London. The band released the \\"Concrete\\" EP in early September 2019, eschewing the drones and extended endings of their previous release for more compact songs with even stronger lead synth elements and sparse guitar work. The song \\"Reflections Through Corrugations\\" written by Kerimofski and sung by Dee came in at number 71 of radio station RTRFM's 100 most played songs of 2019. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia Kerimofski prepared four songs for release as separate digital singles, eschewing the LP and EP formats. The first of these \\"In My Dreams\\" was released in September 2020 and mixed by American-born producer Casey Rice.  2017‚Äìpresent  In November 2017, Kerimofski supported Laetitia Sadier, former vocalist for Stereolab on her Australian tour as a solo artist, interpreting selections from his discography using guitar loops and live Casio. In early-2018, Kerimofski released an EP with ex-Lemonheads member and Half a Cow founder Nic Dalton on a project known as The Hotpoints, heavily influenced by Brian Eno and Turkish psychedelia. The EP was preceded by a 7\\"single in 2017. He toured Germany and Spain in October and November 2018. During this flurry of activity Kerimofski engineered for other artists including a 1970s-style synth pop album for Western Australian artist Em Burrows. He has spent most of 2019 finishing off recordings for The Community Chest and performing more live shows than usual with Turnstyle and The Community Chest. In September 2019 Kerimofski performed a live comedy sketch with SNL alumni Fred Armisen on the latter's Australian tour. The two reportedly met after Kerimofski loaned Armisen a guitar amplifier for an instore performance earlier in the afternoon. In October 2019 Kerimofski toured Japan and live streamed a solo performance from a bar in Nakano City at the tour's conclusion.  Personal life  Kerimofski married in 2004 and has a child. The Kerimofski family live in Bassendean, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Adjunct to his home is The Future Ranch, a small studio complex he uses exclusively for recording and rehearsals.  Equipment  Kerimofski predominantly uses Fender guitars, namely Japanese Jazzmasters and Jaguars and a pre-CBS 1965 Duo-Sonic II that he gifted to his wife in 2013. Kerimofski has been seen occasionally playing a 1967 Gibson SG Melody Maker since 2012. Live dates throughout 2015 and 2016 have seen him using a Guild S-100 reissue. After using a Fender 2 x 12 Deville amplifier for many years, in 2009 he switched to a Fender Deluxe '65 reissue, running it through a mid 70s Fender Bassman cabinet. At the beginning of 2018 he returned to using a larger amp, a Fender Twin Reverb. In keyboards, Kerimofski has remained loyal to Casio's MT series, notably the MT65, MT40 and MT45. Adem also owns a collection of Synthesizers including various Roland models, a Korg MS20, and numerous monophonic Moog synths.

After touring for several years on the Chitlin' Circuit, he released several albums and became popular with listeners of exotica music in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the promotion of his albums, a fictional biography was developed, depicting Chaino as an orphan from a lost tribe in central Africa who had been rescued by a missionary after his tribe had been massacred. Chaino was actually born in Philadelphia and raised in Chicago. Early years Chaino was born in Philadelphia, but he grew up on the South Side of Chicago. After attending grammar school, Chaino left home to see the country. He began playing the bongos and toured \\"the so-called 'Chitlin' Circuit of black nightclubs.\\" According to his brother, George Johnson, Chaino lost touch with his family and \\"vacillated between the brink of stardom and edge of starvation as he made a name for himself in the late 1940s and '50s as a percussionist.\\" Exotica albums In 1958, Chaino teamed up with record producer Kirby Allan; the pair released several albums in the late 1950s. The first album released by the Chaino-Allan team was Jungle Mating Rhythms, released by Verve Records in 1958. Chaino and Allan released six additional albums: Percussion for Primitive Lovers, Percussion for Playboys (vols. 1 and 2), Jungle Echoes, Night of the Spectre, Africana, and Temptation. The albums featured Chaino playing bongos, steel drums and other percussion instruments, combined with primal chants and \\"strains of grunting and howling\\" that Allan called \\"sensual primitive music\\" or \\"Americanized African\\" music. In June 1958, Billboard gave Chaino's \\"Eyes of the Spectre\\" a four-star review and noted: > \\"A truly unusual sound can be heard on this album. Chaino turns in what > amounts to a one-man show on a variety of bongos, congo drums, steel drums, > gourds and assorted noisemakers, altho the label's sound work doesn't do it > real justice. Rhythms are basically African or Afro-Cuban. In the > background, Chaino whistles, wails and occasionally gives a blood-curdling > whoop.\\" Chaino on Los Angeles' Bongo Beach, 1959 Seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the exotica genre, the liner notes for Chaino's albums built a mythology of Chaino as an orphan who was \\"the only survivor of a lost race of people from the wilds of the jungle in a remote part of central Africa where few white men have ever been.\\" According to the liner notes, he learned to \\"play seven or more drums at the same time, with such a blur of speed that you can hardly see his hands.\\" The fictional biography developed for Chaino included a story of being brought to the United States by a missionary and his wife after his tribe was massacred by hostile neighbors. One music historian later wrote that the story contained familiar stereotypes that \\"seemed to parallel the screenplay for a Tarzan film.\\" Allan later recalled his experiences with Chaino: \\"He was a troubled artist, but it was what made him a great artist. He vented all his hang-ups and sexual frustrations busting out on those drums. I almost got shot trying to help him. People would come after him for all kinds of reason.\\" In addition to his solo albums, Chaino also worked as a session musician and appeared in two feature films, Night Tide (1961) and The Devil's Hand (1962), and a television movie, The Phantom (1961). (\\"Bongo drummer Chaino has been signed by writer director Curtis Harrington to compose and play a special drum sequence in Harrington's indie film 'Night Tide,' a Virgo production starring Dennis Hopper and Linda Lawson.\\") In 1962, he toured on the same bill with Miriam Makeba. (\\"Sharing the bill at the Ash Grove are Chaino, a fine performer on the African drums ....\\") He was scheduled to perform with Makeba at the Hollywood Bowl, but was unable to appear because he was in jail at the time. Chaino's music enjoyed renewed popularity in the late 1990s as part of the revival of interest in the exotica and ultra lounge genres. In his book, Mondo Exotica, Francesco Adinolfi wrote that, in Chaino's albums, \\"exotica found its fullest expression: repeated, driving rhythms, savage cries, and tribal iconography intended to trigger the pagan fantasies of the listener.\\" In Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living, Matt Maranian wrote: \\"This is music to mate by; a cut above your average exotica.\\" Another reviewer in 1999 wrote that Chaino's work consisted of \\"trippy tunes\\" that \\"could be heard in settings like tiki parties and porno theaters.\\" Later years Chaino later lived in Oklahoma City where he played in local clubs. In 1997, Chaino returned to Chicago for a reunion with his brother. He was badly injured in a bar fight in Los Angeles in 1998 and again returned to Chicago where he stayed with his brother. He developed a brain tumor and, in July 1999, he suffered a heart attack following surgery to remove the tumor and died in Chicago. A retrospective compact disc titled, Chaino, Africana and Beyond was released shortly after his death.

He visited Oregon in 1991 for the International Pinot Noir Celebration and decided that it would be an ideal location. Mike Etzel, the owner of Beaux Fr√®res, also in the Willamette Valley, was hired as a consultant to look for an appropriate location. In 1992, Paul and Eileen Gerrie purchased the abandoned Pellier Winery site in the Spring Valley region of Polk County and established Cristom Vineyards. The existing vineyards were in a state of disrepair and all but one of them needed to be replanted. The first vintage was produced in 1992 from grapes purchased from other local vineyards. The vineyards were replanted from 1993 to 1996. with the first vintage from the estate owned vineyards bottled in 1994. Cristom's current winemaker is Steve Doerner, who joined the winery as head winemaker for its first vintage. Doerner graduated in 1978 from the University of California, Davis with a degree in biochemistry and had spent 14 years at the Californian Calera Wine Company, specializing in working with Pinot noir, as well as studying under Jacques Seysses, owner and winemaker at Domaine Dujac in Burgundy before being appointed winemaker at Cristom in 1992. Doerner was the first established winemaker from the California wine industry to move to Oregon, and has been followed by many others since. After having established himself as winemaker at Cristom, Doerner was made a partner in the business. The estate is named after Paul and Eileen Gerrie's children, being a portmanteau of Christine and Tom. Vineyards Vineyards at Cristom Cristom has eight estate owned vineyards, with an area of . Six of the vineyards are named after family matriarchs. Marjorie is the only vineyard that was not replanted in the years following the purchase of the winery. It is named after Paul Gerrie's mother. The vines were originally planted in 1982, and there are of Pinot noir. The initial single vineyard wine from this location was from the 1994 vintage. Louise is named after Paul Gerrie's maternal grandmother and was the first vineyard to finish being replanted with of Pinot noir. The first single vineyard wine was the 1996 vintage. Jessie is named for Paul Gerrie's paternal grandmother and was planted with of Pinot noir in 1994. The first release was the 1998 vintage. Eileen, is named after Paul Gerrie's wife, the co-founder and co-owner of the estate. This is the highest elevation Cristom vineyard which slopes from . of Pinot noir were planted in 1997 in this vineyard. The first vintage released was in 2000. Cristom is one of the few Willamette Valley producers growing Syrah. Two other vineyards are planted at the estate with Northern Rhone varieties that are unusual for the Willamette Valley region which is primarily known for Pinot noir. These are a Viognier vineyard planted in 1993 and a Syrah vineyard planted in 2002. Cristom is described as a pioneer of these varieties in this region. Wines Pinot noir grapes at Cristom Vineyard Cristom is best known for its Pinot noir based wines. Four single vineyard wines are produced with Pinot noir grapes from the vineyards Marjorie, Louise, Jessie and Eileen. Cristom also produces a Pinot noir blends, the Mount Jefferson Cuvee named after a mountain visible from the winery. The Mount Jefferson Cuvee is a blend from ten different vineyards, with the best barrels of the blend being separated to be bottled as the Sommers Reserve wine. Around 3,500 cases of the Mount Jefferson and 1,250 cases of the \\"Sommers\\" Reserve are produced each year. In addition to Pinot noir, Cristom also produces a Syrah based red wine from the estate vineyard. White wines are produced from three varieties: a single vineyard Chardonnay as well as Pinot gris and Viognier. Around 18,000 cases of wine are produced each vintage, with about 1,500 of that total being white wines.

Containing nearly 200 genera and 975 species , it is one of the largest families of millipedes. Paradoxosomatids occur on all continents except Antarctica, and can generally be distinguished by dorsal grooves on most body segments and a dumb-bell shaped gonopod aperture. Notable groups within the Paradoxosomatidae include the dragon millipedes of Southeast Asia, and the widely introduced Greenhouse Millipede Oxidus gracilis. Description The family is characterised by several traits. Most species possess a groove or furrow (\\"sulcus\\") on the dorsal surface between the keels (paranota) on each segment, and the keels of the second body segment are situated lower on the body than those of the first segment (collum) and third segment. In males, the opening on the underside of the body where the gonopods (male reproductive appendages) attach has a central constriction, forming the shape of an hourglass or dumb-bell. Males of most species also possess one or two projections on the sternite of the fifth body segment. Paradoxosomatids may have 19 or 20 body segments in addition the head, and ozopores (defensive gland openings) situated on the lateral margins of keels on (in most species) segments 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15 to the last segment. Distribution Paradoxosomatids occur on every continent except Antarctica, although the only species found in North America north of Mexico are introduced. The so-called greenhouse millipede, Oxidus gracilis likely native to Japan, occurs worldwide, often associated with greenhouses or agricultural settings.

Though SPC's earliest product was for the Apple II personal computer, most of its products were for use on text-based DOS desktop computers, with non-graphical-user- interfaces (GUI), long before the graphical GUIs of Macintosh or Microsoft Windows existed. A salient benefit of Harvard Graphics, then, was that it brought sophisticated on-screen graphics capabilities to computers running the normally non-graphical, text-based DOS operating system. This factor played a role in the company's ultimate demise in 1996, as Microsoft Windows was shipping on most desktop computers. Windows incorporated built-in graphical capabilities, so much of what Harvard Graphics provided was no longer needed. SPC scrambled to develop a Windows version of Harvard Graphics, but big competitors and their Windows-native business and presentation graphics tools had so penetrated the Windows market by then that it was just too little, too late. As DOS-based PCs began to disappear, so did SPC's revenues. Early history SPC was established in 1980 by three former Hewlett-Packard employees, Fred Gibbons, Janelle Bedke, and John Page, with an eye to producing packaged software for personal computers like the Apple II. The first application to be launched was the \\"Personal Filing System\\" (PFS), a simple database program for Apple II computers. With the advent of the IBM PC the following year, though, the company quickly shifted focus to the burgeoning DOS-based desktop computer market, which also included a fast- growing number of IBM PC-compatible computers. The Apple II PFS product eventually led to the \\"pfs:\\" series of products for DOS. By early 1984, InfoWorld estimated that SPC was the world's ninth-largest microcomputer- software company, with $14 million in 1983 sales. In 1984 IBM executed an OEM- style agreement pursuant to which SPC would develop the IBM Assistant Series, which was an only slightly enhanced, but completely rebranded version of the \\"pfs:\\" family of products (described in the next section) such that no mention of SPC was present in the software or its documentation; and which IBM intended to sell with its IBM PC and PCjr computers. IBM advertised the suite using a Chaplin-esque figure getting all of his ducks in a row, in a Super Bowl TV ad, and in print ads. By only a year later, in 1985 SPC company had achieved $50 million in revenue from the IBM deal, alone. Major products SPC's first product, its \\"PFS\\" brand database for Apple II computers, was reworked, improved, and then released as pfs:File, a flat-file database for DOS. It was the first of a family of products released by SPC under the \\"pfs:\\" brand which, when installed onto the same computer, combined to form a sort of office suite which included companion products pfs:Write (a word processor), pfs:Plan (a spreadsheet), pfs:Report (reporting software), and pfs:Graph (business graphics software). Other, mostly utilitarian products bearing the \\"pfs:\\" brand subsequently emerged, including pfs:Access (for data communications), pfs:Easy Start (a menuing utility), and pfs:Proof (a proofreading utility). Eventually, SPC offered a low- to mid-level desktop publishing product called pfs:Publisher; and it packaged the core word processing, database and spreadsheet products into a suite named pfs:Office. While relatively limited in their capabilities compared with better-known and more powerful products like the DOS database dBase III, the DOS spreadsheet Lotus 1-2-3, and the DOS word processor WordPerfect, the trio of SPC products proved popular, because of their simplicity and ease-of-use, with beginning and intermediate DOS PC users. Lighter-weight versions of the core \\"pfs:\\" word processing, database, spreadsheet and data communications programs were released as a single, integrated suite called pfs:First Choice for DOS, intended to directly compete with, but be more economical than, Microsoft Works for DOS. The pfs:First Choice product subsequently led to what SPC had hoped would be a larger series of far lighter-weight products bearing the \\"pfs:First\\" label, the most famous of which, after pfs:First Choice, was an entry-level desktop publishing product called pfs:First Publisher, and its fonts and graphics add-ons. A business graphics package called pfs:First Graphics came next, so that the \\"pfs:First\\" series could have lightweight business graphics like the original, and slightly heavier-weight, \\"pfs:\\" series offered. There was no compatibility between the \\"pfs:First\\" series and the \\"pfs:\\" series. In response to business users' requests for a far more powerful, yet still economical word processor that really could compete with the likes of the better-known and more-popular DOS word processors like WordPerfect (and even, by then, Microsoft Word for DOS, SPC released an enhanced version of pfs:Write called pfs:Professional Write, a much higher- powered word processor which was eventually joined by companion products pfs:Professional File (a more powerful database, to better compete with dBase), and pfs:Professional Plan (a more powerful spreadsheet, to better compete with Lotus 1-2-3). These became SPC's higher-end, truly business- oriented and, eventually, networkable and multi-user software product line. Starting with the second versions of the Professional trio, the \\"pfs:\\" was dropped from the product names, making them, simply, Professional Write, Professional File, and Professional Plan. When all three were installed on the same machine, the separately-purchased products could interact with one another as a sort of office suite. The trio also had somewhat limited interoperability with SPC's completely separate business graphics software product called Harvard Graphics, and its later series companion Harvard Total Project Manager. There was, however, no compatibility of the trio, or the Harvard series products, with any of SPC's other earlier \\"pfs:\\" or \\"pfs:First\\" products. Starting with the second versions of the Professional Write, Professional File and Professional Plan trio, a separately-purchased Professional series networking add-on (available in 5-user, 10-user and larger packs) could be obtained so that they could all function in a multi-user local area networking (LAN) environment utilizing rudimentary file locking (but not record locking) via NetBIOS on such as Novell's NetWare, or Banyan VINES. In 1986, SPC released its groundbreaking Harvard Presentation Graphics, one of the first PC applications which allowed users to combine charts, clip art, and text and display fonts into presentation slides. Corporate decline and demise The power of Harvard Graphics product made it extremely popular with DOS PC users, helping to drive SPC's sales revenues to $150 million by 1990. As the popularity of Harvard Graphics soared, SPC shifted focus to high-end business graphics software, and so it sold the \\"pfs:\\" and related series software to Spinnaker Software in 1991. This move made SPC an essentially one- product company. The shift ultimately led, however, to the company's demise. By 1993 the DOS-based Harvard Graphics product accounted for 80% of SPC's revenue. It was valuable to users because it brought to the normally-text- only, non-graphical DOS environment a rich and powerful on-screen graphical presentation tool. However, as more and more business desktop computers began shipping with the Microsoft Windows GUI sitting atop DOS in Windows version 1.0 through Windows 95, and then also in the full operating system version Windows NT, the need for software like Harvard Graphics, which did the kind of on-screen graphical heavy lifting so needed in the non-graphical DOS environment, was suddenly no longer necessary because Windows had on-screen graphics capability built right into it. Though SPC scrambled to release a Windows 3.0 version of Harvard Graphics in 1991, big competitors had, by then, deeply penetrated the Windows business and presentation graphics market with products like Microsoft's PowerPoint and Lotus Development Corporation's Freelance, relegating the Windows version of Harvard Graphics's revenues to less than 20% of SPC's overall sales. Though SPC had begun to rebuild its product line to include products in addition to the DOS and Windows versions of Harvard Graphics‚Äîsuch as ActiveOffice, ASAP WordPower, ASAP WebShow, Harvard ChartXL, Harvard Spotlight, the Superbase 2.0, and Personal Publisher (which SPC acquired from T/Maker) -- all of said new products, even combined with the Windows version of Harvard Graphics, accounted for only a tiny part of SPC's overall revenues. So as DOS desktop computers began to disappear from US businesses by 1994, and revenues from the DOS-based version of Harvard Graphics disappeared with them, SPC's overall revenues plummeted. In 1994, the firm laid off half its staff and Gibbons stepped down as chief executive. In 1996 SPC was purchased by, and became a subsidiary of, Allegro New Media, Inc., a New Jersey-based multimedia publisher of interactive CD-ROM software applications, including 25 titles in five product lines, the most notable of which were its Entrepreneur Guides, Berlitz Executive Travel Guides, Learn To Do Series and Business Reference Series. Earlier that year, Allegro had purchased Serif Inc, which produced publishing and graphics software for the SOHO market, including PagePlus Home/Office 95, PagePlus 3.0 and DrawPlus 2.0, as well as a variety of clipart and font collections. Allegro believed that the move would expand its product lines and distribution capabilities. Allegro renamed itself Vizacom in late 1996 and began actively marketing its new products; however, in 2001 Vizacom sold Serif back to its original management, and included the licensure to Serif of the Harvard Graphics line of products in the sale. Serif continued to market Harvard Graphics 98 for Windows until 2017, when the product was taken off the market.

They can reach a length of about and a weight of about . California barracuda are very popular sport fish in Southern California. S. argentea is a thin barracuda of the family Sphyraenidae of the order Perciformes (perch-likes). Body type and physical description The Pacific barracuda has an elongated cylinder shape body. They are slender and have a long pointy snout. They are of brownish-bluish color on their front sides. They are distinct from other Barracudas due to their silvery shiny backsides, small scales, and the lack of bars or spots on their body. Known for their large mouths full of sharp teeth and fang-like structures, the Pacific Barracuda are predatory fish with aggressive characteristics. Their protruding outer jaw aid the Barracuda in its carnivorous feeding habits. The average weight of the Pacific Barracuda is about 5‚Äì8 kg. Their length is about 1-1.1 m, rarely exceeding 1.2 m. Pacific Barracuda have a distinct feature of a forked tailed fin and widely separated dorsal fins. Habitat The Pacific barracuda is found in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. It is usually considered a pelagic species. Although they could be found as north as Alaska, they are predominant along the coast of California down to Panama. During the winter, the Barracuda migrate south from the California coast to the Mexican coast but do not usually move past that distance. Their most prevalent habitat is the Baja Coast of California. The Pacific Barracuda's natural habitat is in open ocean waters. The species is usually near the shores or coastal areas in adult life, however, when young, Pacific barracuda are found in bays in shallow waters. However, some Pacific Barracuda have been recorded to be found in deep waters, about 37 m. The Barracuda are known to form schools and move across the ocean in these schools of fish. However, in some larger species, it has been noted that they can be found swimming solitarily. Feeding and behavior The Pacific barracuda are a predatory fish, exhibiting aggressive behavior in order to feed on other small fishes. Their diet primarily consists of small fish such as anchovies, small pacific mackerels, grunions, squid, groupers, grunts, and even young barracuda. Their tight schools allow them to herd their prey in shallow waters circled by Barracuda, thus feeding a greater amount of fish. The Barracuda uses its sharp eyesight to find prey, following light or sudden movements in the water that may direct the fish to prey. Their jaw and teeth structure allow them to be fierce predators to their prey. Their jaws also allow them to pump water across their gills.\\"California Barracuda.\\" Aquarium of the Pacific  Online Learning Center  California Barracuda.

Their population continually decreased until the 1940s when the state of California put size and technique restrictions on the commercial and recreational fishing of the Pacific Barracuda. These restrictions caused commercial fisheries to start using gill nets instead of purse seines. Furthermore, Barracuda are not a common seafood item. Since these restrictions were put, the population size has increased to near record levels.\\"California barracuda.\\" California barracuda, Open Waters, Fishes, Sphyraena argentea at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Nowadays, although fishing the species is still popular, the population size is overall stable. The stability of their population size is also somewhat attributed to their substantial egg production. They are not on the IUCN Red List of threatened or vulnerable species. The restrictions continue to protect the species. However, due to their migration, some of their range of population may be threatened.Robertson, R., Collette, B., Molina, H., Guzman-Mora, A.G. & Salas, E. 2010. ‚ÄúSphyraena argentea‚Äù.

It occurs through one massive genomic rearrangement during a single catastrophic event in the cell's history. It is believed that for the cell to be able to withstand such a destructive event, the occurrence of such an event must be the upper limit of what a cell can tolerate and survive. The chromothripsis phenomenon opposes the conventional theory that cancer is the gradual acquisition of genomic rearrangements and somatic mutations over time. The simplest model as to how these rearrangements occur is through the simultaneous fragmentation of distinct chromosomal regions (breakpoints show a non-random distribution) and then subsequent imperfect reassembly by DNA repair pathways or aberrant DNA replication mechanisms. Chromothripsis occurs early in tumour development and leads to cellular transformation by loss of tumour suppressors and oncogene amplifications. In 2015, it was found that chromothripsis can also be curative: a woman who had WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome, an extremely rare autosomal dominant combined immunodeficiency disease, found her symptoms disappeared during her 30s after chromothripsis of chromosome 2 deleted the disease allele. Chromothripsis is a neologism that comes from the Greek words chromo which means color (and represents chromosomes because they are strongly stained by particular dyes) and thripsis which means 'shattering into pieces'. First observation Chromothripsis was first observed in sequencing the genome of a chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Through paired end sequencing, 55 chromosomal rearrangements were found in the long arm of chromosome 8 and a significant number of rearrangements were found in regions of chromosomes 7, 12, and 15. Subsequent investigations using genome-wide paired-end sequencing and SNP array analysis have found similar patterns of chromothripsis in various human cancers, e.g., melanomas, sarcomas and colorectal, lung and thyroid cancers. In subsequent investigations, about 25% of studied bone cancers displayed evidence of chromothripsis. Chromothripsis has been linked to the generation of oncogenic fusions in supratentorial ependymoma, chondromyxoid fibroma, and Ewing sarcoma, the latter two being bone tumours. Chromothripsis has been seen in 2‚Äì3% of cancers across all subtypes. Characteristic features * Large numbers of complex rearrangements in localised regions of single chromosomes or chromosome arms (showed by high density and clustered breakpoints) which suggests that chromosomes need to be condensed e.g. in mitosis for chromothripsis to occur. * Low copy number states- alternation between 2 states (sometimes 3) suggesting that rearrangements occurred in a short period of time. * In chromothriptic areas you get alternation of regions which retain heterozygosity-two copy (no loss or gain), with regions that have loss of heterozygosity- one copy (heterozygous deletion). This suggest that the rearrangements took place at a time that both parental copies of the chromosome were present and hence early on the development of the cancer cell. This also supports the fact that chromothripsis occurs as one catastrophic event in the cells history as once heterozygosity is lost it generally can't be regained and hence the 2 copy heterozygous state occurring in patches throughout the chromothriptic region is hard to explain. *Recently, several additional criteria for the inference of chromothripsis events have been described: clustering of chromosomal breakpoints; prevalence of rearrangements affecting a single haplotype; randomness of fragment joins (that is an approximately equal distribution of tail-to-head, head-to-tail, head-to-head and tail-to-tail segmental connections occurring in conjunction with chromothripsis); and randomness of DNA fragment order along resultant derivative chromosome. Furthermore, if all DNA rearrangements in a region with chromothripsis are detectable, the relative order in which segments are joined can be reconstructed and chromothripsis events identified through \\"derivative chromosome walks\\". Breakage and repair of chromosomes Non homologous end joining and Microhomology mediated end joining The most widely accepted and straightforward model for chromothripsis is that within a single chromosome, distinct chromosomal regions become fragmented/shattered almost simultaneously and subsequently rejoined in an incorrect orientation. Deletion of certain fragments, including deletions that are a few hundred base pairs long, and hence gene segments is possible and consequently the production of double minute chromosomes. When multiple chromosomes are involved in chromothripsis, fragments of both chromosomes are joined together by paired end joining and the exchange of fragments between the original chromosomes. Rejoining of fragments require very minimal or even no sequence homology and consequently suggesting that nonhomologous or microhomologous repair mechanisms such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated break induced repair (MMBIR) dominate double stranded break repair and are involved in modelling the chromothriptic landscape, opposed to homologous recombination which requires sequence homology. Joining of fragments and rearrangements have also been shown to take place on paternal chromosomes. As well as in cancer cells, chromothripsis has also be reported in patients with developmental and congenital defects, i.e. germ line cells. Using multiple molecular techniques of these germ line cells that have appeared to have undergone a chromothripsis like process, as well as inversions and translocations, duplications and triplications were also seen and hence increases in copy number. This can be attributed to replicative processes that involve the restoration of collapsed replication forks such as fork stalling and template switching model (FoSTeS) or microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR). This makes it seem that it would be more appropriate to name the phenomenon 'chromoanasynthesis' which means chromosome reconstitution rather than chromothripsis. However most samples displaying chromothripsis that are analysed have low copy states and hence have paired end joining predominating repair mechanisms. Further study of chromothripsis events and chromothriptic samples is required in order to understand the relative importance of paired end joining and replicative repair in chromothripsis. Mechanism One of the main characteristic features of chromothripsis is large numbers of complex rearrangements occurring in localised regions of single chromosomes. The ability to cause such confined damage suggests that chromosomes need to be condensed e.g. in mitosis, for chromothripsis and chromosome rearrangements to be initiated. The mechanisms of chromothripsis are not well understood. There are multiple ideas of how chromothripsis occurs. =Micronuclei model= Schematic of Micronucleus model of chromothripsis The Micronuclei model is the most accepted model as to how and when the breakage and repair in chromothripsis occurs. In cancer cells, fragmentation of chromosomes has been correlated with the presence of micronuclei. Micronuclei are structures formed by mitotic errors in the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Cells with defective chromosome segregation will form micronuclei which contain whole chromosomes or fragments of chromosomes. The segregation of single chromosomes into individual micronuclei explains why DNA fragmentation is isolated to single chromosomes in chromothripsis. These micronuclei undergo defective DNA replication, which is slower than DNA replication in the main nucleus and causes a proximal DNA damage response (DDR) to be initiated. However, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation fail to follow. Consequently, chromosomes that are not correctly replicated in micronuclei become fragmented. The method by which the pulverization of these chromosomes occur is not fully understood, but it is thought to be caused either by aberrant DNA replication or by premature chromosome condensation, which entails semi- replicated chromosomes being compacted by cyclin-dependent kinase activity. The resulting fragmented chromosome segments can be joined together to give rise to a rearranged chromosome, which can subsequently be reincorporated into the main nucleus of a daughter cell. The new chromosome can persist for several generations of cell cycle divisions and contribute to the development of a cancer cell. Although the micronucleus model is appropriate, other factors are likely to contribute towards chromothripsis for various cancer genomes. =Ionising radiation during mitosis= Chromosome shattering is triggered and reassembly of chromosome fragments in close proximity is caused by environmental stimuli such as high energy ionising radiation encountered during mitosis. =Aborted apoptosis= Stress stimuli such as radiation, nutrient deprivation or oxygen deprivation which causes apoptosis will lead to fragmentation of chromatin and cause most cells to apoptose. However a small subset of cells will survive apoptosis. This cleaved DNA will require repair, and when this is done incorrectly, rearrangements will be introduced into the chromosome. There is currently speculation that chromothripsis might be driven by viruses such as Œ≥-herpes viruses which cause cancer, possibly by the inhibition of apoptosis. However this speculation requires further investigation. =Telomeric dysfunction= Telomeric double stranded breaks or telomeric dysfunction is generated by exogenous agents or replicative stress. Telomeric dysfunctions are known to promote chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer cells. For example, Telomeric double stranded breaks/ telomeric dysfunctions can cause sister chromatid/ end to end fusion and the formation of anaphase bridges resulting in dicentric chromosomes that can result in further rearrangements. This is a more plausible explanation as chromothripsis has been seen to mostly involve telomeric regions. Predispositions Mutations in the TP53 gene can predispose a cell to chromothripsis. Through genome sequencing of a Sonic- Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumour, a significant link between TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs has been found. Further studies on the association between TP53 and chromothripsis has signified a role for p53, a tumour suppressor protein, in the massive genomic rearrangement which take place which takes place in chromothripsis. Hence there is a strong association between p53 status and chromothripsis, giving an insight into why some cancers are more aggressive. It has also been shown that TP53 mutation comprising cells show preference to low fidelity repair mechanisms such as non-homologous end joining. TP53 mutations have also been expressed in cells that exhibit shorter and are more end-end fusion prone. It is also hypothesized that TP53 mutations may be implicated in premature chromosome condensation. TP53 may also contribute to the ability of cells to survive the catastrophic event that normally would be considered to be too destructive to withstand. Relationship to carcinogenesis Chromothripsis has been seen to cause oncogene amplification, amplification of oncogene containing regions and the loss of tumour suppressors. Chromosome segregation errors can lead to DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations such as aneuploidy which is linked to tumour development. The formation of micronuclei generally occurs concurrently with aneuploidy and aneuploidy cells are controlled by mechanisms involving p53. In order for micronuclei to progress through the cell cycle and induce chromosome damage, diminished levels of p53 have been seen to be needed. Through further investigation, chromothriptic tumours have been seen to occur in patients with p53 mutations. Defects in DNA damage response can cause increased frequency of micronucleus formation and hence the occurrence of chromothripsis. There are numerous examples of how DDR pathways affect chromothripsis and hence cause tumour development and cancers. *Bloom's syndrome: Mutations in BLM gene which encodes a family of RecQ DNA Helicases cause accumulation of micronuclei that give rise to Blooms syndrome which predisposes patients to cancer. *Fanconi anaemia: Fanconi Anaemia is a disorder that predisposes patients to cancer due to its effect on DNA repair pathways. Mutations in FANCM gene cause increased micronucleus formation and hence extreme chromothripsis. As well as cells encompassing DDR defects, they are likely to have repressed apoptotic mechanisms which will further enhance the occurrence of mutations and aneuploidy. Prognostics and diagnostics  Research in patients with chromothripsis-associated cancers may provide some information about prognosis. TP53 mutations and chromothripsis have been linked in SHH medulloblastoma patients. Poor clinical outcome in neuroblastomas (such as those caused by deletion of the FANC gene in Fanconi Anaemia) has been linked to the frequent occurrence chromothripsis. Screening biopsy materials for chromothripsis in good prognosis estimates and better treatment of patients.  Etymology  The term is a neologism coined by scientists at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and derives from \\"chromosome\\" and \\"thripsis\\", the Greek word for breaking something into small pieces.  Criticism  It was pointed out that initial computational simulations underpinning the single-event nature of chromothripsis, which are central to the theory, did not necessarily prove the existence of a single event, and that known models of progressive cancer development do not contradict the occurrence of complex rearrangements. It has also been suggested that there is no single traumatic event, but that repeated breakage- fusion-bridge cycles might cause the complex genetic patterns.  Experimental evidence for chromothripsis  In 2015, several research groups presented experimental evidence that chromothripsis is indeed caused by a single catastrophic event. Using a combination of live cell imaging and single-cell genome sequencing of manually isolated cells, it was shown that micronucleus formation can generate a spectrum of genomic rearrangements, some of which recapitulate all known features of chromothripsis. Additionally, research studies inducing telomere crises followed by sequencing the resultant clones demonstrated complex DNA rearrangements that directly recapitulated the one- off chromosomal catastrophe model of chromothripsis.

The Se San River is a major tributary of the Mekong River. The dam site is located east of the provincial capital, also named Stung Treng. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018. History The Lower Sesan 2 (LSS2) was first envisaged in a 1999 study funded by the Asian Development Bank, and in which it was deemed an unattractive investment due to its marginal financial viability and its large potential environmental impact. Nevertheless, a memorandum of understanding between Cambodia's Ministry of Mines and Energy and Vietnam Electricity was signed in 2007 to carry out a detailed feasibility study. In January 2011, the Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment licensed Vietnam Electricity to make a US$816 million investment into the project. The Cambodian government approved the project on 2 November 2012. That same year, EVN withdrew from the project, although it retained a 10% stake in the project. On 26 November 2012, an agreement on the dam's construction was signed between the Royal Group of Cambodia and China's Hydrolancang International Energy, a subsidiary of China Huaneng Group. Description The project was built by the Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co. Ltd., a joint company of the Royal Group of Cambodia and Hydrolancang International Energy. Vietnam Electricity holds a 10% nominal stake in the project. After 40 years of operation, the dam's ownership will be transferred to the government. The power plant will have a capacity of with an average output of per year. It will have five turbines of 80 MW each. The dam is expected to cost US$781 million. Impact According to the environmental impact assessment, the dam's reservoir is expected to inundate numerous villages upstream from the dam, which will force the relocation of many thousands of villagers, many of whom have lived on or near the banks of the Se San River for generations. Both upstream and downstream, the effects of the dam are expected to drastically reduce the fishery resources on which many thousands more villagers depend for food and income. The effects will likely be felt as far away as the Tonl√© Sap Lake. Both the Sesan and Srepok rivers originate in Vietnam's central highlands before flowing through Stung Treng and Ratanakiri (and Mondulkiri) provinces in northeast Cambodia, making hydropower development along these two Mekong tributaries an international and transboundary concern. Impact: Up to 2,000 people will be displaced. At least 38,675 people, including a large number of indigenous peoples, included in at least 86 villages located along the Sesan and Srepok Rivers and in the reservoir area would lose access to the vast majority of their fisheries resources due to the dam blocking fish migrations from the Mekong and Sekong Rivers up the Sesan and Srepok Rivers. In addition, at least 87 villages in Cambodia located along tributaries of these two rivers would also lose access to migratory fish. In total, at least 78,000 people living above the Sesan 2 dam site are expected to lose access to migratory fishBest practices in Compensation and Resettlement for Large dam, by Ian G.

The film is currently the third highest-grossing Italian film in Italy. Plot Checco, a man who works as a bouncer at a nightclub in Brianza, dreams of becoming a carabiniere like his uncle Giuseppe Capobianco, however, he is rejected by Colonel Gismondo Mazzini after his third interview in one year. By the recommendation of the Archbishop of Milan, Checco manages to become a security officer at Milan Cathedral. While working at the cathedral he meets Farah, an Arab woman pretending to be an architecture student in order to gain access to the Madonnina. Farah, with the help of her brother and two other accomplices, plans to place an explosive device at the feet of the Madonnina to avenge the killing of her family in an unspecified bombing. Checco takes Farah to a dilapidated trullo, which he inherited from his grandfather in Alberobello. Checco wants the trullo to be demolished, however, it would cost ‚Ç¨10,000. As the two spend time together, Checco falls in love with Farah. Farah becomes conflicted by her plan to destroy Milan Cathedral, and by the friendship and kindness shown to her from Checco and his family. Before returning to her country, Farah gives Checco a suitcase that is supposed to contain the bomb, telling him not to open it until he reaches the Madonnina. When Checco opens the suitcase he discovers a model of a house that conceals the activation mechanism of the bomb. The bomb, which Farah had evidently placed in Checco's trullo, explodes, demolishing it as Checco desired. Throughout the film, Checco continuously mentions (albeit some do also appear) relatives of his sharing the last name \\"Capobianco\\", acting as a running gag. Cast *Checco Zalone: Checco *Rocco Papaleo: his father Nicola *Tullio Solenghi: Cardinal Rosselli *Mehdi Brando Mahdloo: Sufien *Nabiha Akkari: Farah *Ivano Marescotti: Colonel Gismondo Mazzini *Luigi Luciano: Giovanni *Anna Rita Del Piano: Anna Capobianco, Checco's mother Reception The film was met with high commercial success. In its opening weekend, the comedy surpassed Avatar for the most sales in the first 3 days of release, reaching $9.4 million. In just its second week, it reached $42.2 million in box-office revenue, topping Life Is Beautiful to become the highest-grossing Italian film in Italy. Life Is Beautiful retained the worldwide record for an Italian film with $70 million worldwide. The film was surpassed as the highest-grossing Italian film in Italy by Sole a catinelle in 2013, also starring Zalone and directed by Nunziante and is now third behind the leader Quo Vado?, again starring Zalone and directed by Nunziante.

The unit was first formed in July 1942 and served in the New Guinea Campaign and Borneo Campaign during World War II. The squadron was one of only a few RAAF airfield construction units to be retained at the end of the war, and formed part of Australia's contribution to the occupation of Japan from 1945 until it was disbanded in June 1949. 5ACS was re-raised in August 1951 and worked on several RAAF airfields in Australia. It also provided small detachments of engineers to support RAAF deployments to South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War. The squadron was the RAAF's only airfield construction unit from 1961 onward, and was disbanded in December 1974. History =World War II= On 7 July 1942, 250 men of No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron were detached from the unit while it was stationed at Ascot Vale, Victoria and organised into a new squadron intended to serve in New Guinea.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 19Wilson (1998), p. 45 This unit was designated No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron (Special Works Force), and arrived at Port Moresby on 7 August after a difficult voyage during which the ship carrying it from Australia it ran aground twice.Wilson (1998), pp. 46‚Äì47 The squadron began work constructing Wards Airfield on 14 August, and the first of the airfield's runways was ready for use three weeks later. The airfield's completion was delayed until January 1943 due to shortages of personnel and equipment, however.Wilson (1998), pp. 47‚Äì48 No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron (Special Works Force) was redesignated No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron (5MWS) on 16 November.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 18 In order to support Allied offensives in New Guinea 5MWS moved to Goodenough Island between late February and March 1943 where it constructed Vivigani Airfield. This facility initially comprised a fighter runway and bomber runway as well as headquarters, maintenance and logistics facilities.Wilson (1998), pp. 48‚Äì49 During March and April a detachment from the squadron also assisted No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron at Milne Bay.Wilson (1998), p. 50 5MWS departed Goodenough Island on 21 November for a period of rest and reconstitution in Australia. In early 1944 5MWS became part of a force of RAAF and United States Army aviation engineer units which were selected to build airfields at Aitape in New Guinea from which air support would be provided to Allied operations around Hollandia after US Army forces landed there on 22 April. 5MWS departed Melbourne on 15 February, and eventually joined up with the main body of the airfield engineer force at Lae on 1 April where it received training in infantry tactics. The Landing at Aitape took place on 22 April, and 5MWS came ashore the next day. The airfield at Aitape was ready to be used from 25 April and was later expanded by the aviation engineers.Wilson (1998), pp. 62‚Äì65 On 6 July 5MWS landed on Noemfoor Island where it again formed part of an aviation engineer force tasked with repairing and expanding the island's airfields.Wilson (1998), pp. 66‚Äì67 Allied forces had first landed on the island on 2 July, and it was still not secure when construction work began. As a result, 5MWS personnel were required to man perimeter defences, during which they captured 12 Japanese personnel. While at Noemfoor 5MWS was redesignated No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron (5ACS) on 18 July. As at 25 November, No. 4 Airfield Construction Squadron and 5ACS were the main units of No. 62 Wing. This wing formed part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force, which was the RAAF's main mobile force.Odgers (1968), p. 299 In January 1945 4ACS and 5ACS moved to Biak island where they worked on improving facilities used by the US Army and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). In mid-May 1945 4ACS and 5ACS traveled together to Morotai. They remained on this island until June when they departed as part of the Australian-led Battle of North Borneo.Wilson (1998), pp. 70‚Äì71 The two squadrons landed at Labuan on 11 June and worked on repairing and maintaining the island's airfield until the end of the war on 15 August.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 20Wilson (1998), pp. 86‚Äì87 =Occupation of Japan= While most of the RAAF's airfield construction squadrons were disbanded at the end of the war, on 17 November 1945 5ACS was informed that it would form part of Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. For this deployment it was assigned to No. 81 Wing.Wilson (1998), p. 93 5ACS' advance party arrived in Japan in late 1945 and the rest of the squadron arrived at Iwakuni to the east of Hiroshima on 22 February 1946. At this time the unit was under strength as only 14 officers and 189 airmen had volunteered for occupation duties, though a further 173 personnel arrived in March and April.Wilson (1998), pp. 95‚Äì98 5ACS provided engineering support to BCOF for the next three years. Its initial priorities were to repair the airfields at Bofu, Iwakuni and Miho. By mid-1946 5ACS was engaged in work on these airfields, building small forward airstrips for army reconnaissance aircraft and maintaining another four airfields in BCOF's area of responsibility. These tasks were of great importance to the BCOF, and Australian aviation historian Alan Stephens has written that \\"No. 5 ACS's achievements were probably the most significant of any Australian unit‚Äîland, sea or air\\" during the occupation of Japan.Stephens (2006), pp. 214‚Äì215 Japanese labourers and tradesmen were employed on all of 5ACS' projects, with the squadron's personnel undertaking specialist roles.Wilson (1998), p. 101 The size of BCOF was reduced in 1948 and the Australian Government decided to reduce the RAAF force in Japan to a single flying squadron. Accordingly, 5ACS' remaining responsibilities were gradually transferred to the works officer of No. 77 Squadron and the squadron was disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 June 1949.Wilson (1998), p. 102 =Cold War= A RAAF Dakota transport at RAAF Base Darwin in 1961. This aircraft opened the new runway at Darwin when it was complete. 5ACS was reformed on 8 August 1951 at Bankstown, New South Wales to fill the RAAF's need for engineering units and provide a nucleus for the potential formation of other airfield construction squadrons. It initially worked on projects in Sydney before moving to RAAF Base Williamtown in 1952 where it undertook a major upgrade of that base which lasted until 1955. During this period, the squadron also worked on other RAAF facilities in New South Wales.Wilson (1998), pp. 135‚Äì136 Between March and November 1952 a detachment of 30 men from 5ACS was deployed to the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia to support the British nuclear weapons test in the area, Operation Hurricane. Another detachment from the squadron assisted with the construction of range facilities at the Woomera Test Range in South Australia between 1952 and 1955. Most of 5ACS moved to Darwin in 1955 to build a -long runway and supporting facilities at RAAF Base Darwin, though a detachment remained at Williamtown until June 1963 and two other detachments were formed to undertake engineering tasks in the Sydney region and rebuild the runway at RAAF Base Amberley.Wilson (1998), pp. 137‚Äì138 The expansion of RAAF Base Darwin was completed in 1964. Following the disbandment of No. 2 Airfield Construction Squadron on 28 April 1961, 5ACS was left as the RAAF's only construction unit and took on some of 2ACS' personnel and equipment. For a short period the remnants of 2ACS was designated Detachment C of 5ACS while it completed works on RAAF Base East Sale; this sub-unit was disbanded in September 1961.Wilson (1998), p. 133 Once RAAF Base Darwin was completed 5ACS headed south to develop RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine in the Northern Territory. The squadron's advance party arrived at Tindal in October 1963 and work began on the base in late 1964. The runway was opened in March 1967 and the base was ready to support RAAF units in early 1968. Work on expanding Tindal continued during 1968 and 1969. During this period detachments of 5ACS also worked on projects at Darwin and Amberley, and 5ACS' headquarters moved to Amberley on 14 September 1969.Wilson (1998), pp. 141‚Äì143 Detachments from 5ACS formed part of Australia's contribution to the Vietnam War. Following the deployment of No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand in June 1962, a party of 5ACS personnel was also sent to Ubon to plan and oversee the construction of facilities for the squadron. Work on these facilities was undertaken by 100 Thai civilians who had built over 50 huts and other support infrastructure for No. 79 Squadron by the time the project concluded at the end of 1962.Wilson (1998), pp. 118‚Äì119 RAAF units began to be deployed to South Vietnam in 1964, and in May 1966 Detachment A of 5ACS was formed at V≈©ng T√†u to improve the airfield there so it could support the UH-1 Iroquois-equipped No. 9 Squadron. The 19 members of this detachment returned to Australia on 8 October 1966. Detachment B of 5ACS was subsequently deployed to South Vietnam in January 1967 to build facilities for eight No. 2 Squadron Canberra bombers at Phan Rang Air Base. This task was completed in April, and in June Detachment B moved to V≈©ng T√†u to complete the construction of facilities there. Work on V≈©ng T√†u Airport was finished on 20 January 1968 and the detachment was disbanded on 17 February 1968.Wilson (1998), pp. 121‚Äì126 5ACS' last major project was the development of RAAF Base Learmonth in Western Australia. Initial works began on this project in March 1970 when Detachment E of 5ACS was formed there, and the main body of the squadron arrived on 1 February 1971. 5ACS' task was to extend the existing runway at the site and build facilities to support RAAF combat aircraft in the case of a war with Indonesia. These works were undertaken in difficult climatic conditions and the living conditions provided for the airmen and their families were inadequate. Nonetheless, the runway and extensive support facilities were officially opened on 15 December 1972, though further work needed to be completed at this time.Wilson (1998), pp. 143‚Äì147 In August 1973 it was announced that 5ACS would be disbanded. The squadron's strength declined during 1974 as personnel left the RAAF or moved to other units, and it was disbanded at Learmonth on 15 December 1974.Wilson (1998), p. 147 5ACS was the last of the RAAF's airfield construction units, and since its disbandment civilian contractors have been used to build and maintain air bases.Stephens (2006), p. 248 A memorial plaque commemorating 5ACS was unveiled at the RAAF Memorial Grove outside of Canberra on 21 March 2014. In 2015 No. 65 Squadron was raised to centralise the RAAF's airfield repair and recovery capabilities: the '5' in its title was selected in recognition of 5ACS.

Life He was born on 6 February 1686, the son of John Wheatly, a tradesman of London. His mother, whose maiden name was White, was a descendant of Ralph White, brother of Sir Thomas White. Charles entered Merchant Taylors' School on 9 January 1699, and matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 28 March 1705. He was elected a Fellow in 1707, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1710, and M.A. on 28 March 1713, resigning his fellowship in the same year. On 24 May 1717 he was chosen lecturer of St Mildred-in-the-Poultry, and in 1725 lecturer of St Swithin, Londonstone. On 23 March 1726 he was instituted vicar of Brent Pelham, and on 1 April 1726 vicar of Furneaux Pelham in Hertfordshire. He died at Furneaux Pelham on 13 May 1742, and was buried in the parish church. Works His major work was A Rational Illustration of the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, the title used for all editions beginning with the 4th (1722) edition. The title of the 1st (1710) and 2nd (1714) editions was The Church of England man's companion; or a rational illustration of the harmony, excellency, and usefulness of the Book of Common Prayer. The title of the 3rd (1720) edition was A Rational Illustration of the Book of Common Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the use of the Church of England. The 5th (1728) and 6th (1729) editions were the last published during Wheatly's lifetime. The 7th (1752) edition (only title page consulted) was published posthumously and may have been the last edition corrected by the author himself. It probably included the changes caused by the Calendar Act of 1750, effective 1752. The 8th (1759) edition did include the calendar changes, as did all later editions. It and all later editions deleted the Dedication to John, Lord Bishop of London. Later editions were 1794, 1802, 1810, 1819, 1839, 1845, 1846, 1848, 1849, 1852, 1853, 1867, 1871, and 1890. None of these later editions had a numbered edition printed on the title page. The earliest of the later editions (1794‚Äì1819) deleted the first half of the Preface (originally added in 1720) where Wheatly discussed the changes he made to his second edition ‚Äî this half was included in all later editions (1845‚Äì1890). Wheatly was also the author of: * ‚ÄòBidding of Prayers before Sermon no mark of Disaffection to the present Government,‚Äô London, 1718; new edit. London, 1845. *‚ÄòThe Nicene and Athanasian Creeds ... explained and confirmed by the Holy Scriptures,‚Äô London, 1738. * ‚ÄòFifty Sermons on Several Subjects, and Occasions,‚Äô ed.

Not much is known about Scott but letters kept by Lady Hamilton indicate that they knew each other well. Scott gave Emma news of Nelson and she in turn appears to have taken his wife under her wing. It was through her that he learnt of the birth of his son shortly after leaving England. Scott also spent time with Nelson and Emma at their home, Merton, during a brief spell of shore leave in the summer of 1805. Scott served as purser of before transferring to Victory in May 1803, a transfer that Nelson specifically requested. They served together throughout the long campaign that culminated in the Battle of Trafalgar; a battle that claimed the lives of them both. Assisted by a small team of clerks, John Scott acted as Nelson's principal secretary, dealing with most of the public correspondence. Foreign and confidential mail was handled by Victorys chaplain, the Rev. Alexander Scott. Just prior to the Battle of Trafalgar, Victorys surgeon William Beatty was one of the many officers concerned by the conspicuous dress of Lord Nelson. It was Scott who advised Beatty to keep his thoughts to himself, remarking, \\"Take care doctor, what you are about. I would not be the man to mention such a matter to him\\". At Trafalgar, Scott was stationed on the quarter deck of Victory, next to Nelson. It would have been his job to record the battle but one of the first cannonballs to reach Victory, cut him in half, killing him immediately. When Captain Adair of the marines and a seaman rushed forward to remove the corpse, Nelson asked, \\"Is that poor Scott that is gone?\\" Adair nodded. \\"Poor Scott\\", Nelson added. The body was thrown overboard, as was the custom, but the not inconsiderable amount of blood remained on the deck. When Nelson was shot an hour and half later he fell on the same spot and thus the blood that stained his breeches, now displayed in the National Maritime Museum, was Scott's not Nelson's as so often is supposed. Nelson clearly valued Scott, writing in a testimonial, \\"...as a secretary for ability, punctuality and regularity I believe your superior is not to be met with\\".

It is a hydrated phyllosilicate (sheet silicate) of sodium and iron.  Discovery  Tuperssuatsiaite was first found by Karup-Moller and Petersen in Greenland, in 1984, and given the International Mineralogical Association designation IMA1984-002. It was later named after the type locality, Tuperssuatsiat Bay, Ilimaussaq, Greenland. In 1992 Karup-Moller and Petersen, together with von Knorring and Leonardsen, found more specimens from a second find in the Aris Quarry in Namibia, that allowed a better definition of the properties and composition of the mineral. Later still, in 2005, more material was found by a group of researchers from the University of S√£o Paulo at the Bortolan Quarry, Pocos de Caldas, Brazil, and although the crystals were small, accurate determinations were made of their physical and optical properties, which differed slightly from those of the specimens from Greenland and Namibia.Atencio, Coutinho and Vlach (2005) The Mineralogical Record 36-3: 275-280  Mineral group  Tuperssuatsiaite is a member of the palygorskite- sepiolite group, palygorskite subgroup. Subgroup members (formulae according to the IMA): *palygorskite (Mg,Al)2Si4O10(OH)¬∑4H2O *tuperssuatsiaite NaFe3+3Si8O20(OH)2¬∑4H2O *yofortierite Mn2+5Si8O20(OH)2¬∑8-9H2O Iron occurs both in the ferric state Fe3+ and the ferrous state Fe2+. The formula for tuperssuatsiaite contains only ferric iron, and the Greenland material is consistent with this. Analysis of the Namibian material, however, shows that part of the iron is in the ferrous state. Manganese is also present as a substitute for iron, and a zinc- rich material has been reported from Greenland.  Structure  The mineral belongs to the monoclinic crystal class 2/m, meaning that it has a twofold axis of rotational symmetry perpendicular to a mirror plane. At one time it was thought that the material from Namibia might belong to the monoclinic class 2, without the mirror plane, but a more recent study gives it as 2/m, the same as the material from Greenland.C√°mara, Garvie, Devouard, Groy and Buseck (2002) American Mineralogist 87: 1458 The space group is B2/m, meaning that in the unit cell there is one structural unit at each vertex, and one in the centre of each B face. The palygorskite-sepiolite minerals are clay minerals with a layered structure. In tuperssuatsiaite ribbons of SiO4 tetrahedra, similar to those in the amphibole structure, are aligned parallel to the c crystal axis, and they link to form layers parallel to the plane containing the a and b axes. The spacing between the layers, in the c direction, is about 5 √Ö, which is typical for minerals with an amphibole-type structure, due to the repeat distance along the chains of tetrahedra. Channels occur that could be occupied by H2O as in palygorskite.  Unit cell  There are two formula units per unit cell (Z = 2), and the cell dimensions vary slightly for specimens from different locations; for all specimens, to the nearest √Ö, a = 14 √Ö, b = 18 √Ö and c = 5 √Ö, and the angle Œ≤ = 103¬∞ to 105¬∞. For the three main localities the reported values are: *a = 13.729(30) √Ö, b : 18.000(10) √Ö, c =4.828(30) √Ö, Œ≤ = 104.28(10)¬∞ (Greenland) *a = 13.92(7) √Ö, b = 17.73(5) √Ö, c = 5.30(3) √Ö, Œ≤ = 104.78(l)¬∞ (Namibia) *a = 13.945 to 14.034 √Ö, b = 17.841 to 17.93 √Ö, c = 5.265 to 5.277 √Ö, Œ≤ = 103.35 to 103.67¬∞ (Brazil)  Appearance  Tuperssuatsiaite occurs as fan-shaped aggregates up to several centimeters across, as rosettes and as fibers elongated parallel to the c axis. It is red-brown in reflected light, and colorless to light yellowish brown in transmitted light, with a brownish yellow streak. Crystals are transparent with a bright vitreous luster, but aggregates may be dull and translucent.  Optical properties  The mineral is biaxial (+), with refractive indices Nx ~ 1.54, Ny ~ 1.56 and Nz ~ 1.58 to 1.60. For the three main localities the reported values are: *Nx = 1.54, Ny = 1.56, Nz = 1.58 (Greenland) *Nx = 1.5388(5), Ny = 1.5596(5) Nz = 1.595( l) (Namibia) *Nx = 1.548 to 1.556, Ny = 1.560 to 1.565, Nz = 1.648 to 1.662 (Brazil) It is mildly pleochroic, with X colorless, Y colorless to pale brown or green and Z generally reddish brown. No fluorescence has been observed.  Physical properties  Cleavage is good on a plane containing the b and c crystal axes, parallel to the layers within the structure, and twinning is common. Fracture is uneven to conchoidal (shell-like) and the mineral is brittle; it is quite light, with specific gravity 2.465, which is similar to that of quartz.  Type locality  The type locality is Tuperssuatsiat Bay, Tunugdliarfik Firth (Eriksfjord), Ilimaussaq complex, Narsaq, Kitaa (West Greenland) Province, Greenland, and type material is conserved at the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, and at the National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, US, reference number 162402.  Occurrence and associations  *Greenland: The mineral occurs at the type locality in the Ilimaussaq intrusive complex, Greenland, as a cavity filling in late-stage, low-temperature veins with adularia, natrolite and aegirine, and in late natrolite-albite bodies. *Namibia: It occurs in miarolitic cavities in the Aris phonolite, Windhoek, Namibia, associated with microcline, aegirine, natrolite, eudialyte, bastnasite, makatite, villiaumite, titanite, apophyllite, analcime and aragonite. Aris is a phonolite quarry about 20 km south of Windhoek, Namibia, which is mined for road gravel. Some zones of the phonolite rock contain numerous small cavities a few centimetres in diameter, with well-formed, microscopic crystals of various minerals, including the abundant occurrence of tuperssuatsiaite.http://www.koeln.netsurf.de/~w.steffens/aris.htm *Brazil: Tuperssuatsiaite occurs in the abandoned Bortolan tinguite quarry, Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Tinguite is a dark green intrusive phonolite composed essentially of alkali feldspar, nepheline and aegirine. The tuperssuatsiaite occurs in and near miarolitic cavities in the tinguite, as fibers and needles to 4 micrometers thick and 3 mm wide, isolated or more commonly as rosettes, tufts and shapeless aggregates, often associated with pectolite. *Other localities: Tuperssuatsiaite has also been reported from Quebec, Canada and the Lovozero Massif, Russia.http://www.koeln.netsurf.de/~w.steffens/lovo.htm  References   External links  *JMol *Palygorskite structure Category:Phyllosilicates Category:Iron(III) minerals Category:Sodium minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ","title":"Tuperssuatsiaite"},{"id":"30518060","text":"Jensens B√∏fhus Jensens B√∏fhus (, \\"Jensen's Beef House\\") is a Danish steakhouse chain consisting of 33 restaurants (September 2018); 23 in Denmark, 8 in Sweden and 2 in Norway.

He also won two gold medals at the 2003 Pan American Games and a gold medal at the 2007 Pan American Games. He won the American Speed Skater of the Year award three times in a row, in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the 2007 Elmer Ringeisen Sportsmanship Award. In October 2010, after winning two world titles at the inline skating championships in Colombia, he was ranked second among male competitors in the USOC Athlete of the Month competition. As of January 7, 2010, Mantia held the world records for the road race over 500 m (38.6 seconds), 10,000 m (13 minutes, 46.801 seconds) and 20,000 m (28 minutes, 56.189 seconds), and the world records for the track race over 300 m (24.250 seconds) and 15,000 m (22 minutes, 32.644 seconds). Early life Joey Mantia started skating on roller blades as a self-described \\"rink rat,\\" often asking his parents to bring him to the local indoor skating rink. He spent a lot of time at public skating sessions and learned about speed skating by watching inline skating practice at the rink. After experiencing inline speed skating, Mantia decided to dedicate his life to \\"becoming the best speed skater in the world\\". Speed skating career In 2010, Mantia switched from inline speed skating to speed skating on ice. He first moved to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and then to Salt Lake City, Utah, to train with the national team two years later. Mantia finished fourth at the 2011 US speed skating championships over 5000 m, tenth in the 1000 m and eighth in the 1500 m. In early 2013, Mantia made his debut on the World Cup competition circuit. He found success less than a year later, at the Berlin World Cup in December 2013 where he finished first in the 1500 m, beating out his teammate Shani Davis, a two-time Olympic silver medalist in the 1500 m, and Russia's Denis Yuskov, the reigning world champion, to win gold. Mantia represented Team USA at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics where he finished 15th in the 1000 m, 22nd in the 1500 m and 7th in the team pursuit. In January 2018, Mantia qualified for the 2018 U.S. Olympic Team, winning the 1000 m and 1500 m events. He also qualified for the mass start. =Personal records= As of January 17, 2018, his ranking on the all-time Adelskalender is 55th. Personal life Mantia is an investor and owner in Coffee Lab, a coffee shop located on the University of Utah campus. In his free time, Mantia taught himself to play piano.

A user of surveillance data in a general sense is defined in this context as any Air Traffic Control (ATC) subsystem having a requirement to receive at defined instants the best and most up-to-date position information for all air traffic of interest to this user (e.g. Operator Display System, Flight Data Processing System, ATC Tools, Flow-Control Management Units, Remote Terminal Maneuvering Area's, Military Units, etc.). The data can be originating from a surveillance sensor (e.g. radar, ADS-B receiver, Multi-lateration system) or a surveillance data processing system (e.g. ARTAS) RMCDE is a Multibus II based multiprocessor system composed of a number of subsystems (processor and IO boards) connected through a parallel data bus. In addition to its distribution function, the RMCDE offers additional capabilities to manage the surveillance data flow like data validation, conversion and filtering. RMCDE History Until 1990, each ATC centre was serviced by a dedicated set of (local) radars. Radar data exchange was only done at a limited scale, one of the reasons being that the sensors were using proprietary, incompatible formats. An exception to this practice is the Eurocontrol Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC). Designed from the beginning as an international centre handling only en-route traffic, it does not have its own sensors since the MUAC airspace was already sufficiently covered by the sensors of the 4 participating states (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany). In April 1990, the Ministers of Transport of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) launched the \\"En-route Strategy for the 1990s\\" - a multilateral strategy designed to ensure that, by the end of the century, Air Traffic Control capacity will match forecasted demand. This strategy drove an initial programme, EATCHIP - the European ATC Harmonisation and Integration Programme, developed and managed by Eurocontrol to undertake the progressive harmonisation and integration of Air Traffic Services throughout the ECAC area. One of the key points in this strategy was to harmonise the data formats used in ATC data exchange. The format chosen for surveillance data was ASTERIX (All Purpose Structured Eurocontrol SuRveillance Information Exchange). The combination of harmonisation, MUAC data needs and the emergence of computer network technology led the way to the development of a X.25 based surveillance data distribution network:EUROCONTROL Surveillance Data Distribution System (SDDS)Surveillance Communication / Surveillance Data Distribution, Next Generation (SDDS-NG) RADNET. RMCDE Concept The main component in RADNET is the RMCDE. It takes care of the data routing within the network and acts as a gateway between sensors and ATC users. In the early days, the conversion of data from proprietary formats to the open ASTERIX format (and back) played a crucial role in the acceptance of ASTERIX. The conversion allowed a smooth transition toward the new standard. The RMCDE is one of the first systems in the ATC domain that provided what now would be called publish/subscribe services. Each user connected to RADNET can subscribe to surveillance data provided by any of the other RMCDEs in the network. In order to cope with the limited bandwidth of network connections in those days, the RMCDE allows filtering and merging on the source node, so that only data which is of real interest is sent across the network. This gave a huge boost in the international exchange of surveillance data. Whereas this exchange initially was mainly used to get a seamless coverage, it is now becoming an important element in reducing the cost of air navigation service provision by sharing resources. In an ATC centre the RMCDE is used as a front-end processor (i.e. the first system to be encountered by incoming surveillance data). This means that it also acts as a gatekeeper. It therefore has a number of capabilities to protect downstream systems. The surveillance data is checked according to a number of rules set in the ASTERIX standard and corrupted data is immediately discarded. The filter function, both static and dynamic (i.e. depending on load), ensures that downstream systems are not flooded by huge amounts of unnecessary data. RMCDE/RADNET Implementation Team (RIT)  The RADNET/RMCDE combination is not only a new technology that was introduced for surveillance data exchange. It is a complete service concept. In addition to the technology, a common implementation approach was developed, radar sharing agreements were drafted between states and EUROCONTROL established an organisational unit that was responsible for the day-to-day support of both the technological as well as the organisational aspects. The RIT is tasked with configuration management and coordination of activities related to RADNET and the support and development of technology that ensures the continuity of surveillance data distribution in the EUROCONTROL member states. RMCDE deployment Although initially only intended for deployment at MUAC and the centres servicing MUAC (i.e. Amsterdam, Brussels, D√ºsseldorf and Bremen), more than 100 RMCDEs have been deployed in the ATC infrastructures of 18 Eurocontrol member states. Future developments After more than 25 years of service the Multibus II based architecture can be considered as obsolete and the software is no longer compliant with modern regulations. Furthermore, the phasing out of the X.25 technology requires new solutions to be put in place for network communication. Therefore, Eurocontrol decided in 2008 to develop a successor, the SDDS (Surveillance Data Distribution System). The SDDS is fully in line with requirements set by the Single European Sky initiative from the European Union. SDDS is already operational in several EUROCONTROL member states. With the introduction of the SDDS, the RADNET will transition to SURNET which no longer has geographical limitations. The RIT will be renamed to SDDS Implementation, Maintenance and Operational Support Team (SIMOS).

Life The second son of George Daubeny, a Bristol merchant, he was baptized 16 August 1745, educated at a private school at Philip's Norton, and sent when 15 years old to Winchester College. Shortly after his admission he fell ill, was incapacitated for more than a year, and never entirely recovered. He became head boy of the school, and at age 18 gained an exhibition at New College, Oxford, where he later became a Fellow. Coming of age, his father having died, he inherited a fortune, but the state of his health constrained him. In 1770 he went abroad to the German mineral springs. In 1771 he visited St. Petersburg, where, by the influence of the Princess Dashkow, whose acquaintance he had made in Paris, he was introduced at court, and made some study of Greek Catholicism. On his return to England in 1772 he resided for some months at Oxford to prepare for holy orders, a necessary qualification to his admission to a fellowship at Winchester College. He was ordained deacon in 1773 by the Bishop of Oxford, and priest in the following week by Richard Terrick, bishop of London, and in the same year graduated B.C.L. He obtained his fellowship in 1774, but only held it for two years, when the college living of North Bradley, Wiltshire, was offered him. This living was poor and the parish neglected. He now married a Miss Barnston, and until his vicarage could be made habitable lived at Clifton. He set about restoring his church, and supplemented the Sunday morning service by others in the evening and during the week. He also rebuilt the vicarage, raised the income of the living, and started a Sunday school. He was at first unpopular with his parishioners, both on account of his orthodoxy (most of the inhabitants being dissenters), and because he had pulled down cottages to enlarge the vicarage grounds. In 1784 he was appointed to the prebend of Minor Pars Altaris in Salisbury Cathedral, and four years later published his first work, ‚ÄòLectures on the Church Catechism.‚Äô For the two following years Daubeny resided abroad, and was at Versailles on the outbreak of the French Revolution. In 1790 his health was weak and he wintered in Bath, Somerset and while there interested himself in promoting the erection of a free church. His first sermon in aid of this object produced over ¬£1,200. Christ Church, Bath was opened in 1798, and was the first free and open church in the country; Daubeny became the first minister. Christ Church, Bath In 1804 he was appointed archdeacon of Salisbury. In 1801 he had been thanked and invited to court for a sermon preached before the king and queen at Weymouth. Daubeny declined the invitation, as his retired habits rendered him unfit for a court chaplain. George III, however, urged his claims for a bishopric upon various ministers. In 1808 he founded and endowed an almshouse for four poor inhabitants of North Bradley, and also built a school at the same place at his own expense. In a charge delivered in 1812 he gave reasons for supporting the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in preference to the Bible Society, which gave rise to a controversy between the supporters of the different societies, but in which he did not take a very active part. From 1805 to 1816 he was chiefly engaged in literary work and his parochial duties; in the latter year, he had a paralytic stroke. In 1817 he superintended the erection of a poor-house he built for the use of his parishioners. In 1821 he published seventeen sermons, by Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, which he had modernised with the view of making them more popular. The University of Oxford in 1822, in recognition of his services to the church, conferred upon him the degree of D.C.L. During the following year his parishioners expressed a wish that a church should be erected at Road to serve a distant part of the parish, and Daubeny set about collecting subscriptions for the purpose. He got a fever, and his life was for some time despaired of. Shortly after his recovery, he lost his wife. During this year the church at Road, Christ Church, Rode, was consecrated, Daubeny preaching the sermon; its cost, with the endowment and parsonage, was upwards of ¬£13,000, of which he contributed nearly ¬£4,000. On Sunday 8 July 1827 he officiated both at Bradley and Road, and on Monday morning he was taken suddenly ill and died 10 July 1827. By his will, he left several thousand pounds towards parochial objects. Works Daubeny was rigidly orthodox; in his theories of the dignity and importance of the Church of England and her ministers he anticipated the Tractarians. He was a strong advocate for education, though he wrote against the system introduced by Joseph Lancaster. He was a voluminous author. His principal work are: * ‚ÄòLectures on the Church Catechism,‚Äô 1788. * ‚ÄòA Guide to the Church, in several discourses,‚Äô 2 vols. 1798‚Äì9. He prepared a series of lectures, delivered to his parishioners at Bradley, embodying a scheme for the union of different parties in the Christian church; and in 1799 he followed it with an appendix which constituted a second volume. This work, which endeavours to prove that the discipline of the church of England is of apostolic origin, and that, therefore, any departure therefrom is schismatical, became popular; it was, however, attacked by nonconformists. * ‚ÄòThe Fall of Papal Rome,‚Äô &c.; 1798\\\\. * ‚ÄòLetters to Mrs. Hannah More, on her Strictures on Female Education,‚Äô 1799. * ‚ÄòEight Discourses on the Connexion between the Old and New Testament,‚Äô 1802. * ‚ÄòVindici√¶ Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶,‚Äô 1803. * ‚ÄòThe Trial of the Spirits; a Warning against Spiritual Delusion,‚Äô 1804. * ‚ÄòReasons for Supporting the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in preference to the new Bible Society,‚Äô 1812. * ‚ÄòA Word to the Wise,‚Äô 1812. * ‚ÄòA few Plain Thoughts on the Liturgy,‚Äô 1814. * ‚ÄòRemarks on the Unitarian Mode of Explaining the Scriptures,‚Äô 1815. * ‚ÄòOn the Doctrine of Regeneration,‚Äô 1816. * ‚ÄòThirteen Discourses,‚Äô 1816. * ‚ÄòOn Schism,‚Äô 1819. * ‚ÄòSeventeen Sermons of Bishop Andrewes Modernised,‚Äô 1821. * ‚ÄòThe Protestant's Companion,‚Äô 1824. * ‚ÄòSupplement to the Protestant's Companion,‚Äô 1825.

Early life Brookes was born at Cheadle Hulme, near Stockport, Cheshire, and baptised on 19 May 1754. His father, a shoemaker, who removed soon after his son's birth to Manchester, was a cripple of violent temper, known by the name of Pontius Pilate. He had, however, a genuine affection for his boy, who was educated at the Manchester Grammar School, where he attracted the notice of the Rev. Thomas Aynscough, M.A., who obtained the aid which, with a school exhibition, enabled him to proceed to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. on 17 June 1778 and M.A. on 21 June 1781. Religious career and personality In the following year he became curate of Chorlton Chapel, and in December 1790 was appointed chaplain of the collegiate church of Manchester, a position which he retained until his death on 11 November 1821. He acted for a time as assistant master at the grammar school, but was exceedingly unpopular with the boys, who at times ejected him from the schoolroom, struggling and shrieking out at the loudest pitch of an unmelodious voice his uncomplimentary opinions of them as \\"blockheads\\". He was an excellent scholar, and one of his pupils, Dr. Joseph Allen, bishop of Ely, acknowledged, \\"If it had not been for Joshua Brookes, I should never have been a fellow of Trinity\\" - which proved the stepping-stone to the episcopal bench. Brookes was a book collector; but although he brought together a large library, he was entirely deficient in the finer instincts of the bibliomaniac, and nothing could be more tasteless than his fashion of illustrating his books with tawdry and worthless engravings. His memory was prodigious. In his common talk he spoke the broad dialect of the county, and his uncouthness brought him frequently into disputes with the townspeople. He would interrupt the service of the church to administer a rebuke or to box the ears of some unruly boy. A caricature appeared in which he is represented as reading the burial service at a grave and saying, \\"And I heard a voice from heaven saying - knock that black imp off the wall !\\". The artist was prosecuted and fined. Brookes's peculiarities brought him into frequent conflict with his fellow-clergymen. As chaplain of the Manchester collegiate church he baptised, married, and buried more persons than any clergyman in the kingdom. He is described in Parkinson's Old Church Clock as the \\"Rev. Joseph Rivers\\", and he appears under his own name in The Manchester Man by Isabella Banks. In 'Blackwood's Magazine' for March 1821 appeared a \\"Brief Sketch of the Rev. Josiah Streamlet\\", and that Brookes read it is evident from his annotated copy, which is now in the Manchester Free Library. The article was incorrectly attributed to Mr. James Crossley, but was in fact by Charles Wheeler. In appearance he was diminutive and corpulent; he had bushy, meeting brows (Parr styled him \\"the gentleman with the straw-coloured eyebrows\\"), a shrill voice, and rapid utterance. He was careless and shabby in his dress, except on Sundays, when he was scrupulously clean and neat. His portrait, from a drawing taken by Minasi a few weeks before his death, has been engraved. His general appearance gained him the nickname of the \\"Knave of Clubs\\", though he was usually styled \\"St. Crispin\\". Accounts of his character portray him as unconventional, quick- tempered, amiably eccentric and rather abrupt.Bradshaw, L. D. (1985). Origins of Street Names in the City of Manchester. Radcliffe: Neil Richardson. ; p. 51 His friend Joseph Aston wrote a tribute to him in the Manchester Exchange Herald which mentioned his undeviating love of truth and spirit of forgiveness, though \\"deficient in some of those qualities which are too often the apologies for the absence of more substantial virtues\\".Bradshaw (1985), p. 51 Miscellanea Joshua Brookes is portrayed in Mrs Linnaeus Banks's novel The Manchester Man.Lloyd (1972); pp. 63‚Äì64; referring to Thomas Ellwood, South Manchester Gazette, chapter XI.

Sri Mulam Thirunal Ramavarma, who became maharajah of Travancore in 1886, established it in an order issued on 30 March 1888. In 1898, the strength of the council was increased to 15, comprising nine officials and six non-officials. In 1904, a lower house called the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly (known in the local language as Sree Mulam Praja Sabha) was formed with 88 members to provide for increased participation of the people in the administration.http://www.keralaassembly.org/history/popular.html Its membership was limited to representatives of landlords and merchants. Although not a legislature, it was intended to give the people an opportunity to bring to the notice of the government their requirements, wishes or grievances, and to make government policies and measures better known to the people. The members of the Assembly were not elected but chosen, two from each taluk, by the District heads from among landholders who paid an annual land revenue of not less than Rs.100, and landholders or traders whose net annual income was Rs.6000 or above. In 1905, the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly began to have elected members. Out of the new strength of 100 members, 77 were to be elected and 23 were to be nominated. Voting right was limited to persons who paid an annual land revenue of not less than Rs.50, or whose net income was not less than Rs.2000. University graduates with not less than ten years of standing, and having their residence in the respective Taluk, were also eligible to vote. In 1907, the Assembly was conferred the right to elect members of the upper Legislative Council. The Upper Council had 15 members‚Äînine officials and six non-officials. In 1919, the Council was remodelled raising its strength to 25, out of which eight were elected members. In October 1921, the total strength of the Council was further raised to 50, with the majority elected members.

His work includes film and video art, photography, installation and objects. Hess interprets interpersonal conflicts as a result of systemic pressure. Often an individual event is brought to mind in the context of historical events.  Life  Hess' youth is marked by visits to the southern English coast. The proximity to the British overseas ports led him to develop a strong passion for transatlantic ships. Although this topic is not the focus of his work, his works‚Äìespecially film‚Äìreflect countless details and often metaphoric imagery. From 1988, Hess studied at the Stuttgart State Academy of Arts and the Academy of Fine Arts in Hamburg and attended the classes of Katharina Sieverding and Franz Erhard Walther. From 1998 to 2000 he studied Film at the University of Hamburg by Michael Ballhaus and others. Since 2010 he has been teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts, Saarbr√ºcken/GER. Ellmar Hess lives and works in Berlin.  Work  = \\"War Years\\" = Elmar Hess ‚Äì Cold War Elmar Hess, who has an outwardly apparent similarity to the U.S. actor Orson Welles, directed his artistic debut work in 1996. In his film \\"War Years\\", he styled a relationship crisis, a World War II. A huge kitchen table turns into a battlefield on which quarreling lovers, staged in allusion to the meeting between Winston Churchill (Hess mimes) and Adolf Hitler. Like many details in a surreal film event, the film is to be experienced from the narrative perspective of a large model ship that is involved in the turmoil of war. The film focuses on the media handling of the serious German heritage, breaking taboos: images and sounds, figures, landscapes and architecture of the Nazi dictatorship and World War II fade into the storyline of the film with a character of many. In almost playful manner Nazi and Allied war strategies are identified as historical fund with scenes from a private relationship clinch. The relationship drama put the \\"War Years \\" as a tableau of social landscape in a soulless world: People are pressed into the intellectual cross transitions of serious seeming commentary voices and appear involved in the gluttonous machinery of a war that is raging in the vacuum between the social, historical and collateral relations. = \\"Freedom is not for free\\" = Elmar Hess ‚Äì Freedom is not for free In Hess' installation \\"Freedom is not for free\\" from 2006, the theme of his work is similar to \\"War Years\\", ending a conflict of love in front of the tribunal of a human rights committee. The case is a troubadour of grotesque stereotypes and behavior against better knowledge. Behind the individual drama the work traces a vision of society in which the fulfillment of human aspirations through lobbying and manipulation is prevented by the media. As in most current work of Elmar Hess video sequences like in \\"Freedom is not for free\\" are in the center of his installation in which objects, photographs and records of private origin are connected with historical events. The battle of the sexes mutates into the confrontation between the two superpowers during the Cold War. Acting as historical figures acquaintances were kit out by Hess before he photographed them in known poses. Treating his friends ironically deceptively similar, Hess overstates politicians such as John F.

Apple claimed during their media event on March 2, 2011 that the ARM Cortex-A9 central processing unit (CPU) in the A5 is up to two times faster than the CPU in the Apple A4, and the PowerVR SGX543MP2 graphics processing unit (GPU) in the A5 is up to nine times faster than the GPU in the A4. Apple also claimed that the A5 uses the same amount of power as the A4. The last operating system update Apple provided for a mobile device containing an A5 (iPad 2 CDMA, iPhone 4S, and first-generation iPad Mini cellular models) was iOS 9.3.6, which was released on July 22, 2019. The latest operating system update Apple has provided for an Apple TV containing an A5 (third-generation Apple TV and third-generation Rev A Apple TV) was Apple TV Software 7.5, which was released on March 24th, 2020.  Design  The A5 chip features a dual- core 45 nm Cortex-A9 CPU (shrunk to 32 nm in later versions of the chip) including the Advanced SIMD (Neon) extension, and a dual-core 32 nm PowerVR SGX543MP2 GPU. The A5 integrates an image signal processor unit (ISP) that can perform advanced image post-processing, such as face detection, white balance, and automatic image stabilization. The A5 also directly integrates Audience earSmart technology for removing surrounding background noise and secondary voices during phone calls. The clock rate of the Cortex-A9 in the A5 used inside the iPad 2 and first-generation iPad Mini is 1 GHz. Both of these devices, unlike devices containing the A4 with a clock rate of 1 GHz, can automatically underclock their A5 chip to save battery life. The clock rate of the Cortex-A9 in the A5 used inside the iPhone 4S and fifth-generation iPod Touch is 800 MHz (underclocked from 1 GHz). It is unknown what the clock rate of the Cortex-A9 in the A5 used inside the third-generation Apple TV and third-generation Rev A Apple TV is. When the A5 was first released, the production cost of the chip was estimated to be 75% more than the A4, with the difference expected to diminish when production would later increase. , the A5 was manufactured at Samsung's Austin, Texas factory. Samsung invested $3.6 billion in the Austin facility to produce various chips, and nearly all of the facility's output was dedicated to producing Apple chips. Samsung later invested a further $4.2 billion in the Austin facility in order to transition to a 28 nm fabrication process by the second half of 2013.  Apple A5 versions  Three versions of the A5 chip exist: S5L8940 (containing a 45 nm CPU), S5L8942 (containing a 32 nm CPU), and S5L8947 (containing a single-core 32 nm CPU). Apple also designed a separate high-performance variant of the A5 called the Apple A5X, which features a wider memory subsystem and two additional GPU cores. The A5X was used only in the third-generation iPad. = Apple A5 (S5L8940) = The S5L8940 version of the A5 was used in the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S. The CPU was manufactured on a 45 nm fabrication process. The die of this version takes up 122.2 mm2 of area. It uses the PoP method of installation to support RAM. The top package contains two 256 MB LPDDR2 chips, providing a total of 512 MB of RAM. = Apple A5R2 (S5L8942) = The S5L8942 version of the A5 was used in the third-generation Apple TV (one CPU core is disabled), the iPad 2 (iPad2,4 revision), the fifth-generation iPod Touch, and the first-generation iPad Mini. The CPU was manufactured on a 32 nm fabrication process. The die of this version takes up 69.6 mm2 of area‚Äînearly 41% smaller than the die of the S5L8940 version.

Albanian Abjad script alphabet called Elifbaja, from the Ottoman period. The Albanian Vilayet (, Vil√¢yet-i Arnavid) was a projected vilayet of the Ottoman Empire in the western Balkan Peninsula, which was to include the four Ottoman vilayets with substantial ethnic Albanian populations: Kosovo Vilayet, Scutari Vilayet, Manastir Vilayet, and Janina Vilayet. In some proposals, it included the Salonica Vilayet as well. The creation of the Vilayet was confirmed in September 1912, but negotiations were interrupted a month later in October by the beginning of the First Balkan War. Plans for an Albanian Vilayet were lost with the Partition of Albania. A separate Albanian super-vilayet was a part of the agenda of many Albanian organizations and societies since 1877, during the period known as the Albanian National Awakening. Establishment of such a vilayet was agreed between the Albanian rebels and the authorized representatives of the Ottoman government on September 4, 1912, following the Albanian Revolt of 1912. Soon after that agreement however, the First Balkan War broke out and most of the remaining European territory of the Ottoman Empire was occupied by the Balkan League member states. After the army of the Kingdom of Serbia captured Skopje, Ismail Qemali invited a group of Albanians from all four Ottoman vilayets that were agreed to be united into the Albanian Vilayet, to attend an All-Albanian Congress in Valona. There they declared independence on November 28, 1912, and set up the Provisional Government of Albania. The same territories were claimed by nations in the region that had already raised their national development to independent statehood: Shkod√´r vilayet was claimed by the Serbs and Montenegrins, Kosovo vilayet by the Serbs, Montenegrins and Bulgarians, Monastir vilayet by the Serbs, Greeks and Bulgarians and Janina Vilayet by the Greeks. A few weeks after the beginning of the First Balkan War, the biggest part of the territories intended for the Albanian Vilayet was in the hands of Balkan League member states, as a condominium. Final frontiers between the Balkan League members and the new Principality of Albania were decided by the treaties of London and Bucharest, and ignored the frontiers of the proposed Albanian Vilayet, leaving substantial Albanian populations living outside the newly established Albanian nation-state.  Events  = Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights = The Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights was organization established in the city of Istanbul, Turkey, then Ottoman Empire in 1877 by an influential group of Albanian intellectuals, patriots, and politicians, such as Sami Frash√´ri, Vaso Pasha, Abdyl Frash√´ri and many others. The chairman of the Committee was Abdyl Frash√´ri. This Committee published the idea for uniting the vilayets of Monastiri, Scutari, Kosovo and Janina into one Albanian vilayet in the paper Terc√ºman-ƒ± Hakikat. Contrary to what is often said, a claim for territories very often included the Salonica Vilayet too. = League of Prizren 1878 = The League of Prizren was an Albanian political organization founded on 10 June 1878 in Prizren, in the Kosovo province (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire. The initial position of the league, based on the religious solidarity of the landlords and the people connected with the Ottoman administration and the religious authorities, was reason for naming the league ‚Äî The Committee of the Real Muslims () On the first meeting of the league was written a decision memorandum (kararname) that did not mention reforms, autonomy, or the union of the Albanian populated vilayets into one vilayet. Soon after the first meeting of this organization it adopted a new agenda, under the influence of Abdyl Frash√´ri, that included establishing of the Albanian Vilayet. It was not an appeal for Albanian independence, or even autonomy within Ottoman Empire but, as proposed by Pashko Vasa, simply the unification of all Albanian speaking territory within one vilayet. Terc√ºm√¢n-i-≈ûark () (newspapers which provided detailed coverage about events in Albanian populated area), in which Sami Frash√´ri was member of the staff, reported about the events in the Albanian populated area () and about the unionist society () established by the delegates of League of Prizren. = League of Peja 1899 = The League of Peja () was an Albanian political organization established in 1899 in the city of Peƒá (Peja), Kosovo. It was led by Haxhi Zeka, a former member of the League of Prizren and shared the same platform in quest for an autonomous Albanian vilayet within Ottoman Empire. There were two groups of members. The first group of conservative and more moderate members wanted five vilayets (with Salonica Vilayet included) to be united into the Albanian vilayet, and the second group of the more radical members wanted full administrative autonomy for the four vilayets united in the Albanian vilayet. = Albanian Revolt of 1912 = The flag of the Autonomous Albanian Vilayet The Albanian Revolt of 1912 was one of many Albanian revolts in the Ottoman Empire and lasted from January until August 1912. The revolt started in the western part of Kosovo vilayet and was led by Hasan Pristina, Nexhip Draga, Bajram Curri, Riza Bey and others. Hasan Prishtina who was in the Kosovo vilayet during the revolt, and Ismail Qemali who was in Europe gathering weapons and money and attempting to win over European public opinion to the cause of the uprising, maintained communication through the British Consulate in Skopje. Essad Pasha Toptani obliged himself to organize the uprising in Central Albania and Mirdita. After a series of successes, Albanian rebels managed to capture the city of Skopje, the administrative centre of Kosovo vilayet within the Ottoman rule. The revolt ended when the Ottoman government agreed to accept all demands (ignoring only last one, court martial for Ottoman officers who attempted to suppress revolt) on September 4, 1912.  List of accepted demands  On August 9, 1912 Albanian rebels presented new list of demands (so called list of Fourteen Points) related to the Albanian vilayet that can be summarized as follows: * autonomous system of administration and justice * Albanians to perform military service only in territory of the four vilayets, except in time of war * employing the officials knowing local language and customs, but not necessarily Albanians, * establishment of new licees and agricultural schools in the bigger districts * reorganization and modernization of the religious schools and use of Albanian language in secular schools * freedom to establish private schools and societies * the development of trade, agriculture and public works * general amnesty for all Albanians involved in revolt * court martial for those Ottoman officers who attempted to suppress revolt The Ottoman government ended the Albanian revolts by accepting all demands (ignoring only the last one) on September 4, 1912. Hasan Prishtina was planning to start a new revolt in three or four months, because his main goal was not for the autonomy of but independence of the Albanian Vilayet. However the First Balkan War soon broke out and destroyed his plans. = First Balkan War = Territory captured in the First Balkan War. When the First Balkan War broke out, members of the Balkan League captured most of the territory that was promised to be Albanian Vilayet in period October‚ÄîDecember 1912. Balkan allies planned the partition of the European territory of the Ottoman Empire among them and in the meantime the conquered territory was agreed to have status of the Condominium. The final fate of the captured territory was to be decided by the Treaty of London and Treaty of Bucharest. = Albanian Declaration of Independence = When the army of Kingdom of Serbia won Battle of Kumanovo and seized the Skopje and when the Bulgarian army captured Kƒ±rk Kilise, at the beginning of the First Balkan War, Ismail Qemali decided to send telegrams to Albanians from the Albanian Vilayet to come to congress to Valona on November 28, 1912. They declared independence and set up a provisional government. = Treaties of London and Bucharest = Disposition of territories occupied during Balkan Wars according to Treaty of Bucharest (1913) The Treaties of London and Bucharest dealt with the territorial adjustments arising out of the conclusion of the Balkan Wars. The frontiers of the newly established Principality of Albania covered only the portion of the territory of Albanian vilayet while its biggest part become the part of the Slavic states and Greece (Balkan League). The Kingdom of Bulgaria lost the conquered parts of the Albanian vilayet during the Second Balkan War.

Habitat It is a pelagic- neritic, brackishwater / marine fish, widespread in the eastern Atlantic coasts of Spain and Morocco including Madeira and the Canary Islands. It is also found in the western Mediterranean, Adriatic and Black Seas. Fishing The major small-scale fishing gears exploiting this species are the various coastal beach seines, small mesh size (10 mm) gill nets and lift-nets. Rarely it can be caught on very small hook, baited with small chunks of fish meat. Live Mediterranean sand smelt is excellent bait for many predatory species that feed on this gregarious fish.

Based on a life mask and other measurements of George Washington taken by Houdon, it is considered one of the most accurate depictions of the subject. The original sculpture is located in the rotunda of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia, and has been copied extensively. The date given for the sculpture varies. It was commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly in 1784, begun in 1785, signed \\"1788\\", completed in 1791 or '92, and delivered in 1796. Description The original statue is carved from Carrara marble, weighing 18 tons. It depicts a standing life-sized Washington. In his right hand is a cane, his left arm rests on a fasces on which is slung his cape and sword, and at the back is a plow. He is shown wearing his military uniform, as Washington wished to be depicted in contemporary attire, rather than that of antiquity popular in Neo-classical sculpture. With its selection of objects both civilian (the plow and cane) and military (the fasces, sword and uniform), the statue has been interpreted as invoking the imagery and ideal of an Ancient Roman dictator, Cincinnatus, with whom Washington has been compared in his decision to retire from public life following the Revolutionary War. At the time of its commission, Washington had not yet served in the Constitutional Convention, and would not become President of the United States until 1789. Chief Justice John Marshall, a contemporary of Washington's said of the work, \\"Nothing in bronze or stone could be a more perfect image than this statue of the living Washington.\\" Whittemore, Frances Davis, ‚Äò‚ÄôGeorge Washington in Sculpture‚Äô‚Äô, Marshall Jones Company, Boston, 1933 p. 26 Houdon original During the design process, Houdon produced this plaster bust of Washington in 1786. He later revised it before making the final statue. (National Portrait Gallery) In 1784, the Virginia General Assembly commissioned a statue of George Washington \\"to be of the finest marble and the best workmanship,\\" necessitating a European craftsman. The Governor of Virginia gave the responsibility of selecting the artist to Thomas Jefferson, then ambassador to France, who together with Benjamin Franklin recommended that Jean-Antoine Houdon, the most famous sculptor of the day, execute the work. Unsatisfied to work from a drawing of Washington by Charles Willson Peale sent for the project, and lured by a potential commission for an equestrian monument by the Congress of the Confederation, Houdon agreed to travel to the United States to work directly from Washington. His voyage was conditional on his life being insured for the trip, asking \\"that ten thousand livres be paid to his family should he die during the voyage\\".Chinard, Gilbert, editor, ‚Äò‚ÄôHoudon in America‚Äô‚Äô, Arno Press, New York, 1979 p. xv On July 28, 1785, (or, July 22, 1785 Chinard, Gilbert, editor, ‚Äò‚ÄôHoudon in America‚Äô‚Äô, Arno Press, New York, 1979 p. viii) Houdon sailed with Benjamin Franklin and \\"two of his workmen\\" from Southampton, England, arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 14. In early October 1785, Houdon along with three assistants stayed at Washington's plantation Mount Vernon, taking detailed measurements of Washington's arms, legs, hands and chest and making a life mask of his face. By December, Houdon had returned to France. Though inscribed with the date \\"1788\\", it was completed in France in 1791 or 1792 (depending on the source). It was finally delivered to Richmond in 1796 and placed in the rotunda on May 14, 1796. Various explanations for the delay in its delivery have been given, including the French Revolution and untimely payments to Houdon, though most sources agree that the continued construction of the new Virginia State Capitol prevented its installation until the time it arrived. The equestrian monument that originally attracted Houdon to America was never commissioned. The 1783 resolution authorizing such a statue would eventually be fulfilled in 1860 when Clark Mills's equestrian statue of George Washington was installed at Washington Circle. In the early 21st century the statue, together with the life mask and bust created by Houdon during the design process, were used as part of a forensic reconstruction of George Washington at various ages undertaken by Mount Vernon. Copies Beginning in the 19th century, numerous copies of the statue have been made in bronze and plaster, with molds often made directly from the original. =Hubard casts= Following the destruction of a statue of Washington created by Antonio Canova when the North Carolina State House burned in 1831, there was a fear that a similar fate might befall Houdon's statue. During the 1850s, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the casting of 11 bronze copies of the monument. Six bronzes were produced by the foundry of Richmond artist William James Hubard. Known casts from the Hubard foundry are located at: * Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, unveiled in 1856. After the occupation of Lexington in the American Civil War, it was temporarily relocated to Wheeling, West Virginia, and returned in 1866. * North Carolina State Capitol, in 1857. It was the first monument placed on the new capitol's grounds, designed to replace the destroyed Canova statue. * South Carolina State House grounds in Columbia, South Carolina, 1853, and installed in 1858 * Another traveled around a bit, finally finding a home in Lafayette Park, St. Louis, Missouri in 1914 McCue, George, Photographs by David Finn and Amy Binder, ‚Äò‚ÄôSculpture City: St. Louis, Sculpture in the ‚ÄúGateway to the West‚Äù‚Äô‚Äô Hudson Hills Press NY and Laumeier Sculpture Park, St. Louis, 1988 p. 178 * Rotunda of Alumni Hall at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. * New York City Hall, cast 1857, purchased 1884.

Released in 2011 in Japan and 2012 in North America and PAL regions, it is a direct sequel to the 2009 role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII and is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. A port to Microsoft Windows was released on Steam in December 2014 followed by iOS and Android in September 2015. XIII-2 includes modified features from the previous game, including fast-paced combat and a customizable \\"Paradigm\\" system to control which abilities are used by the characters, and adds a new system that allows monsters to be captured and used in battle. It features a heavy time travel element, allowing the player to jump between different times at the same location or different places at the same time. Lightning, the protagonist of the original game, has disappeared into an unknown world. Her younger sister Serah Farron, a returning character, and a young man named Noel Kreiss, journey through time in an attempt to find Lightning. Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 and lasted about one and a half years. The game was unveiled at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game, and developer tri-Ace was hired to help with the game's design, art, and programming. The development team wanted to exceed Final Fantasy XIII in every aspect while making the story's tone mysterious and darker than the previous game. The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used in Final Fantasy XIII and includes a less linear overall design. Final Fantasy XIII-2 received highly positive reviews from Japanese critics and generally positive reviews from Western video game journalists. Though praised for its gameplay, lack of linearity, and graphics, the game's story was criticized as weak and confusing. During the first week of sales in Japan, the game sold 524,000 units, becoming the fifth-best selling game of 2011 in Japan, and sold 3.1 million copies worldwide by January 2013. It was released digitally for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in June 2013 along with a Japan-only re-release including downloadable content. A sequel, Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, was released in November 2013 in Japan and February 2014 in North America, Europe and Australia. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. On November 13, 2018 it was added to Xbox One Backward Compatibility along with its prequel and sequel making it playable on the console. It is also Xbox One X Enhanced allowing it to display in 4K Ultra HD. Gameplay =General navigation= The player directly controls the on-screen character through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game, just as in Final Fantasy XIII. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, providing a 360¬∞ view. Final Fantasy XIII-2, which includes normal and easy modes, has a world rendered to scale relative to the characters; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the world on foot or by chocobo, large flightless birds that appear regularly in the Final Fantasy series. The game world is divided into multiple regions and time periods; the player can visit a region in multiple time periods and multiple regions at the same time period. For example, the region of Oerba can be reached in the years 200 and 400 AF, while the Sunleth Waterscape and Augusta Tower regions can be visited in the year 300 AF. Some regions, because of plot points within the game, have alternate versions of themselves; for example, two versions of the Academia region in the same year can be accessed once the plot has made the second version available. Connecting these regions is the Historia Crux, which the player can access at will. The game's regions are represented as a branching path instead of being accessed linearly. New regions can be unlocked via plot points or by acquiring optional special items and the player may transfer between unlocked regions at any point. When accessing a previously visited region, the player appears in the location of their last visit. Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically saved when players enter the Historia Crux, as well as at key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of accessing stores at save points like in XIII, the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game data log provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII-2. When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not repeatable. The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game. =Combat system= alt=A man and a woman attacking a spined, canine monster with swords in a canyon, with a UI overlay on top of the image depicting their status. Combat is almost identical to the previous game's version of the series' Active Time Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, but there are also other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while in the middle of a fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles. Monsters do not freely roam the map like in Final Fantasy XI to XIII, but instead, they randomly appear as in the earlier Final Fantasy games. For a limited time after monsters appear, the player may attack them to gain a combat bonus; after this window expires, the monsters attack the player to begin a regular battle, and if too much time passes before combat begins, the player cannot restart the fight during combat. When the battle begins, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen as in XIII. Three characters are used in combat‚Äîthe two main characters and a monster. Monsters must be captured from battles before they can be used, and there are around 150 different monster types available to be collected. Captured monsters act just like the main characters, but can also perform a \\"feral link\\" attack that increases the chance of capturing another monster. Either of the two main characters can be selected as the one that the player has direct control over at any point; the other character and the monster are then controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each enemy has a meter, called a Chain Gauge, consisting of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can choose only from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters have only one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were available only to the protagonists of that game. =Crystarium= The Crystarium is a leveling and growth system, making a return from Final Fantasy XIII in an altered form. The system consists of constellation-style representations of the character's weapons and tamed monsters, made up of small and large crystal nodes, which can be accessed from the start of the game. There is one Crystarium system available for each monster and Paradigm role. Crystogen points gained in battle can be used to expand the Crystarium, unlocking bonuses to health, magic, or strength, or provide the characters with new abilities and slots for battle accessories. For the monsters, the bonuses are unlocked with items dropped by defeated enemies. Synopsis =Setting= The story of Final Fantasy XIII-2 follows on from that of Final Fantasy XIII, but as is typical for the series, it is unrelated to all other previous Final Fantasy games. In XIII, one of the fal'Cie‚Äîa god-like race‚Äîtransformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie with magical powers and a 'Focus'‚Äîan assigned task to be completed within a time limit), in the hope that they would initiate the end of the world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe. XIII-2 begins three years after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the collapse of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called Chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline. =Characters= As opposed to the previous game, Lightning, the main character of XIII, only appears as a supporting character and the game's primary narrator. The two main playable characters are Serah Farron, Lightning's sister and the second narrator, and Noel Kreiss, a young man originally from the distant future. Other characters from the previous game who appear in important roles are Hope Estheim, who becomes leader of the Academy, and Snow Villiers, Serah's fianc√©, who set off to find Lightning for Serah. The three other main characters from the previous game, Oerba Dia Vanille, Oerba Yun Fang and Sazh Katzroy, appear in cameo roles. Three new characters are introduced: Caius Ballad, the game's primary antagonist; Paddra Nsu-Yeul, a seeress possessing the all-seeing Eyes of Etro; and Alyssa Zaidelle, a young girl who works as an assistant to Hope. A minor supporting character is Mog, a Moogle sent with Noel by Lightning as Serah's \\"good luck charm\\". =Plot= The game opens in 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is attacked by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears to help fight the monsters and claims to be a time traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where he claims to have met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve a paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII. Traveling to the ruined city of Paddra in 10 AF, they find Hope, who has become the leader of the Academy, with Alyssa as his assistant. They also find a recording of prophecies made by one of the seeresses of Paddra, who are believed to have died out centuries prior: one fragmented prophecy shows Lightning in Valhalla. Paddra is shrouded by an eclipse, which Noel says is not supposed to happen for several centuries. While Serah and Noel resolve the paradox causing the eclipse, they encounter Caius Ballad, a man Noel knows from 700 AF who opposes their mission, and Yeul, who looks identical to a girl of the same name Noel knew in the future. After resolving the paradox, an alternative timeline appears in which there was never an eclipse. The repaired prophecy shows Caius in Valhalla fighting Lightning and the pillar supporting Cocoon collapsing. Noel claims that this takes place around 400 AF, devastating the human population as well as the world, creating a future where he is the last human in existence. Serah and Noel move on, while Hope and Alyssa work on finding a way to prevent the pillar's collapse. Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, the pair find Snow fighting a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays the fall of Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair then go to the city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream- worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart. Yeul explains that every time the timeline is changed, the resulting shock kills her; Caius has been driven mad by watching her die repeatedly and seeks to end the process by unleashing the Chaos trapped in Valhalla to destroy all time. Serah, it is revealed, has the same power, and risks death every time she changes the future. Resolving to go on, Serah breaks free of her dream- world and frees Noel from his, in which he is the last living human after his Yeul dies and Caius leaves for Valhalla. After briefly encountering Lightning, the pair fight Caius, first in 500 AF Academia and then in Valhalla. As they defeat him, he claims to have killed Lightning, then impales himself through the heart on Noel's blade, killing the weakened Etro. When the pair return to Academia in 500 AF, where Vanille and Fang have been rescued from the collapsing pillar and the new Cocoon, named \\"Bhunivelze\\", has risen, Serah dies in front of Noel and Hope from the shock of the future changing. Just then, a black cloud erupts from the sky as the Chaos that Etro was keeping trapped breaks free. Lightning is then shown in crystal stasis on the throne of Etro's temple. If the player completes all optional parts of the game, they are shown an additional scene in which Caius is on the throne, declaring that the goddess is gone for good, and that Yeul and he can begin a new life freed from their 'curses'. Development =Production= Director alt=A Japanese man in a brown jacket and dark grey shirt standing at a podium Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 and lasted about one and a half years. It was carried out by Square Enix's 1st Production Department, a collective name for the teams in charge of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, Dissidia Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. Many of the key personnel from Final Fantasy XIII remained in their roles: Motomu Toriyama was director, Yoshinori Kitase producer, Tetsuya Nomura character designer and Isamu Kamikokuryo art director. The troubled development of Final Fantasy XIII that had been caused by the simultaneous creation of the company-wide engine Crystal Tools gave reason to rethink the production process for high-budget games at Square Enix. For Final Fantasy XIII-2, the team consulted the European subsidiary Eidos to more closely adapt a Western approach to game development. As a consequence, monthly schedules and project milestones were introduced to better monitor the staff members' progress. Furthermore, unlike its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIII-2 was not entirely developed in-house; Japanese studio tri-Ace was contracted to help out with aspects of the game design, art and programming. This was done to keep the number of internal staff members on the game lower. The contributions of external developers were planned and clearly divided beforehand to achieve a more structured team organization. Concept videos and frequent test playing during production helped constantly engage the staff and keep to the original vision of the game. Despite its strong sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints included that the game had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel in line with what players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series. =Writing= Toriyama originally envisioned the plot not as a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII but instead as taking place 900 years after. However, while creating the backstory for the events in between both eras, it was decided to have the game revolve around time traveling. Toriyama expressed his wish to \\"create a story where [Lightning] ends up [truly] happy one day\\" as he considered her emotional state at the end of Final Fantasy XIII doubtful. He also wanted to \\"see [Serah] take an active part\\" because her crystal stasis over the course of the predecessor's story did not allow for such a role. Lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe thought about how the narrative could be continued in a sequel. Emi Nagashima, also known by her pen name Jun Eishima, had written novellas for Final Fantasy XIII and was consulted early on in development to help come up with the plot for Final Fantasy XIII-2. The narrative was divided into smaller \\"pieces of drama\\" similar to a television series rather than one overarching story piece. This was reflected by the game's working title Final Fantasy XIII: Season 2 when the project was first proposed within the company. Unlike Final Fantasy X-2, which had a more cheerful and humorous feel than Final Fantasy X, the staff members wanted the overall tone of Final Fantasy XIII-2 to be serious as well as darker and more mysterious than its predecessor. The original scenario had called for Serah to travel alone with Mog. However, Kitase felt that their dialogue was \\"quite girly, almost camp and a bit over the top\\" and resulted in a tonal shift that was too similar to the one from X to X-2. Noel was added to the story to counter this. Watanabe considered scriptwriting for the game's two-character party difficult. With the lack of varied personality traits provided by an ensemble cast, he had to ensure that conversations between Serah and Noel would not be repetitive or unrealistic. Unfamiliar concepts and terms in Final Fantasy XIII, such as \\"l'Cie\\" and \\"fal'Cie\\", were deemed too difficult to understand and hence avoided in the sequel. A story link to Final Fantasy Type-0 via the location Valhalla was planned but later discarded. =Art design= Based on the much darker tone of Final Fantasy XIII-2 compared to its predecessor, Kamikokuryo decided on surrealism as the main theme for the graphics. The works of Salvador Dal√≠ and Giorgio de Chirico were used as visual references and helped Kamikokuryo strike a balance between photorealism and fantasy-like surrealism. Unlike Final Fantasy XIII, the game had a much tighter schedule allowing for little pre-production. Kamikokuryo hence used photographs instead of self-drawn pictures to explain his setting ideas to the other staff members. For example, a photograph of ruined buildings in the Cuban capital Havana inspired the look of Valhalla. Character design duties were split up: Nomura designed the faces of the new and returning main characters while their clothing was done by other artists. Kamikokuryo drew the final version of Lightning based on a silhouette sketch and suggestions by Nomura. Yusuke Naora took charge of Serah's, Noel's and Caius' costumes, while Hideo Minaba worked on Yeul, Alyssa and the adult version of Hope in the same capacity. Mog was designed by Toshitaka Matsuda after he had received a request for a cute and mascot-like Moogle character. =Music= Composer alt=A Japanese man with graying hair stands behind a piano keyboard. The music of Final Fantasy XIII-2 was composed by Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Mitsuto Suzuki. Keiji Kawamori coordinated the three artists to ensure their styles meshed well. Hamauzu, who was the sole composer for the music of Final Fantasy XIII, wrote roughly a quarter of the game's tracks, as did Suzuki, while Mizuta wrote nearly half. Prior to this game, Mizuta had worked on the music of Final Fantasy XI, and Suzuki had been a sound director for several Square Enix games and served as an arranger for XIII. The game's director, Motomu Toriyama, wanted the game's soundtrack to have more variety than that of the music in Final Fantasy XIII, as well as feature more styles. As a result, the game had three composers rather than just Hamauzu. Toriyama also wished for the music to have \\"a more edgy sound\\" and more vocal pieces, so that it would sound \\"unlike the typical Final Fantasy title\\". The music incorporates a wide variety of styles, from orchestral and electronic to rap, hip-hop, jazz funk, and metal. Since the release of the game, Square Enix has published the 2011 four-disc soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII-2 Original Soundtrack, as well as an album of arrangements and alternate versions of tracks from the game, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack PLUS, in 2012. The theme song for the game, , was released by singer Mai Fukui as a single in 2011, and the English version of the song, sung by Charice Pempengco and included in the non-Japanese versions of the game, was included on her 2012 album Infinity. Reviews of the soundtrack album were positive, with critics praising both the variety of styles and quality of the pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as possibly his finest to date. Reviewers were mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks. Marketing Final Fantasy XIII-2 was first hinted at three months after the January 2010 release of Final Fantasy XIII. Kitase said in an interview \\"If we could do a XIII-2, we could direct all our attention to the story and refine what we have already built.\\" Toriyama stated in the October 2010 Ultimania Omega companion book that he hoped to continue the story. Two months later, Nomura released a drawing of Lightning along with the words \\"She must not be forgotten\\". On January 11, 2011, Square Enix registered the domain name FinalFantasy13-2game.com via a proxy company that it had used to register websites for several other unannounced games. Final Fantasy XIII-2 was officially announced at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo on January 18, 2011. The teaser trailer showed Lightning, outfitted in armor, drawing her weapon and engaging Caius, who was not yet named. To promote the game's release in Japan, Japanese singer Yuko Oshima was appointed the leader of a group of thirteen official test players. =Downloadable content= The game features downloadable content (DLC) in the form of downloadable outfits, weapons, accessories, scenarios, recruitable monsters and minigames. Although there had been initial plans to release DLC for Final Fantasy XIII, these ideas did not come to fruition. For Final Fantasy XIII-2, the team designed and planned for content, including DLC, that would expand on the game since the beginning of its development. Players who own Final Fantasy XIII save data can unlock an additional wallpaper (PS3) or gamer picture (Xbox 360) for the save file. DLC released after the game contained additional weapons, costumes, and monsters. Post-release downloads also included \\"Final Fantasy XIII Lost Report\\", which offers a look back at Final Fantasy XIIIs story through the perspective of non-playable characters from the game, and three downloadable scenarios for other characters: \\"Perpetual Battlefield\\", which reveals Snow's fate; \\"Heads or Tails\\", which shows how Sazh came to 500 AF Academia; and \\"Requiem of the Goddess\\", which shows Lightning's struggle against Caius and explains how she became crystallized in the main story's ending. Reception =Sales= During its first week of release in Japan, Final Fantasy XIII-2 sold 524,000 copies, and the PlayStation 3 version was the highest-selling game for the system. The Xbox 360 version only reached 48th. Although high, initial sales were notably lower than what they were for the game's predecessor, which sold 1.5 million units in its first week. By the end of the year, the game had sold over 697,000 units, and was the fifth-best selling game of 2011 in Japan. It was just below four handheld video games, making it the highest-selling home console game in Japan that year. It finished 2012 with over 840,000 copies sold in Japan. In the United States, the game placed as the second-best selling game of February 2012, just below Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. In the United Kingdom, Final Fantasy XIII-2 was the best-selling game of February 2012. By January 2013, Final Fantasy XIII-2 had sold 3.1 million copies worldwide, almost half of the 7 million IGN Japan copies its predecessor sold. It would ship an additional 200,000 to 400,000 copies according to Square Enix press releases. Its Steam release sold over 330,000 copies by early 2016. To October 15, 2017 has sold a total of 3.7 million copies. =Reviews= Final Fantasy XIII-2 received very favorable reviews by Japanese reviewers, getting perfect scores from the Japanese magazines Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. Famitsu editor Ranbu Yoshida said that \\"it feels like a very different game from its predecessor\\" and that \\"it's easy to lose yourself in changing and redoing areas you've previously finished.\\" Assistant editor Norihiro Fujiwara added that \\"the setting and presentation is fantastic, and the issues people brought up with the first game‚Äîits linearity, its lack of meaty gameplay‚Äîare a thing of the past. You're sucked into the game right from the beginning, and the story's very easy to get into.\\" The game won the \\"Future Division\\" award at the 2011 Japan Game Awards and later won an \\"Award of Excellence\\" at the 2012 Japan Game Awards. Outside Japan, the game received mostly positive reviews, which primarily focused on the changes in the game from its predecessor. Reviewers generally praised the graphics. The Edge review described the environments as \\"entirely captivating\\" and said that the \\"visual and audio design is marvellous\\", and Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot praised the graphics as beautiful and visually diverse. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com disagreed, however, saying that the art \\"represents a step back from the splendor of Final Fantasy XIII\\". The music received mixed reviews; Parish said that the music was great, applauding the unique styles, but Simon Parkin of Eurogamer felt that the music \\"suffers from a lack of coherent direction\\", and tracks often failed to match their scenes. Dale North of Destructoid felt that the soundtrack was \\"wonderfully varied and lots of fun\\" and predicted that \\"traditionalist\\" fans of Final Fantasy music would not like it as much because of the varied new styles. The gameplay was generally praised as well, with many reviewers noting the improvements in areas they saw as problems in the previous game. Parkin praised the game's \\"smart, engaging mechanics\\" and the \\"novel structure\\" of the gameplay. Joe Juba of Game Informer said that the changes to Final Fantasy XIIIs battle system made it his favorite Final Fantasy battle system, and that the gameplay was \\"phenomenal\\". Ryan Clements of IGN felt that the gameplay was an improvement over XIIIs, fixing many of its problems. Parish stated that XIII-2 was an inversion of XIII in that the gameplay took precedence over the story. He described the battle system as \\"a joy\\" and said that the game was \\"never not fun\\". VanOrd agreed that the combat was fun, though he found it to be too easy. The Edge review, which was harsher on the game than most others, also found it to be too easy, which combined with what they saw as poor subquests and a lack of effort put in some regions made the gameplay uninteresting. The story of the game received poor to mixed reviews. Parish felt that it was confusing and inessential to the game, while Juba said that it was \\"a disaster\\" which \\"screws up at almost every turn\\", overshadowing the game's good points. Parkin felt that the characters were weak and the story was not engaging, and Clements said that the story was insubstantial, which he found particularly disappointing as most Final Fantasy games focused heavily on their story. VanOrd was less negative towards the characters and story than most others, but still described the characters as good, but not great. He felt the game focused too much on the less interesting characters of Noel and Serah over Lightning and Caius, and said that the story was \\"semi-coherent\\" and missed several emotional notes, particularly in the first half of the game. Sequel Hints and rumors began circulating about a sequel to Final Fantasy XIII-2 as early as December 2011, when Square Enix registered the Final Fantasy XIII-3 web domain. At the time, the company stated that it was simply a precaution and did not mean there was such a game. After the game was released with a \\"To be continued\\" ending, Square Enix said that the ending was chosen to prompt players to explore the alternative endings and remain ready for the coming DLC levels. However, after the release of what was stated to be the final piece of DLC, officials at Square Enix announced that they would be releasing future Final Fantasy XIII-related content. In late August 2012, a teaser site was unveiled in preparation for the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Event, titled \\"A Storm Gathers\\", promising a \\"new direction for the saga of key character Lightning\\". At the event, it was announced that the title for this game would be Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, that it would be released in 2013, and that it would serve as the ending to the story of the main Final Fantasy XIII character, Lightning.

(1999). Exploring the Learning from an Enterprise Simulation, Journal of Management Development Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonlyHenfrey, Richard (1989). \\"Executive\\" simulation, Executive Development, Vol. 3 Iss: 2 used in corporate situations to improve business awareness and management skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course. The word simulation implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a lifelike experience. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide.Ellet, Bill (1997). TMR Shortlist of Business Simulations, Training Media Review Publications They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation & Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain. __TOC__ Purpose Companies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees.Shaw, Elizabeth, O'Loughlin, Andrew and McFadzean, Elspeth (2005). Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation Part 2: A Role- and Process-based Approach, European Journal of Innovation Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 4 With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on making decisions in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or product design, and these are called Functional Simulations. Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called Total Enterprise Simulations.Biggs, William D. (1990). Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors. Training Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to \\"think outside the box\\" and see the bigger picture.Duncan, Graham A. Home and Away: Application of the Executive Simulation for Education and Training Purposes in Dundee and Malaysia This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful. Although the most common use for training simulations is in a corporate setting,Declan Doyle, F. William Brown, (2000). Using a business simulation to teach applied skills ‚Äì the benefits and the challenges of using student teams from multiple countries, Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 24 Iss: 6 simulation games are increasingly being used to educate young people about the importance of business. From secondary school age all the way up to MBA students, anyone can benefit from the first-hand experience of running a company and making decisions that directly affect performance.Prohaska, Charles R. and Frank, Ellen J. (1990). Using Simulations to Investigate Management Decision Making. Simulation & Gaming, Vol. 21 No. 1 This will allow the participants to gain an overall understanding of the business world, and give some insight into the type of skills that are necessary to succeed.Elgood, Chris (1996). Using Management Games It is also important to note that 'beating the game' should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives.Butler, Michael J. R. and Reddy, Peter (2010). Developing Critical Understanding in HRM Students: Using Innovative Teaching Methods to Encourage Deep Approaches to Study, Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 34 Iss: 8/9 If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice.Hynes, Briga, Costin, Yvonne and Birdthistle, Naomi (2011). Practice-based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education: A Means of Connecting Knowledge Producers and Users. Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning, Vol. 1 Iss: 1 Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation.Neal, D. J. (1997). Group Competitiveness and Cohesion in a Business Simulation. Simulation & Gaming, Vol. 28 Iss: 4 This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period. Development The concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years,Keys, Bernard and Wolfe, Joseph (1990). The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research. Journal of Management, Vol. 16, No. 2 but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called The Top Management Decision Game, and was created by the American Management Association.Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems. Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are computer based,Stuart, John M. (2007). Business Simulations - Do They Have a Place in Training? and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered.Fripp, John (1997). A Future for Business Simulations?, Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 21 Iss: 4 Most simulations are based around a real industry, and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge. Integrated Most corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme.Faria, A. J. (1987). A Survey of the Use of Business Games in Academia and Business. Simulation & Gaming, Vol. 18 No. 2 This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows: * Introduction: the organizer of the program (plus sometimes a specialist in the training simulation) will meet the participants and give them a brief explanation of the purposes behind the training and what they should hope to achieve. * Lectures: sometimes the trainees will also receive one or more lectures around the topics that the simulation will be based on, in order to give them an idea of the type of skills they will need. This is especially important within academia, when the students will often be examined on this section after the event. * The simulation: the simulation will then be played, allowing newly acquired knowledge to be tested and skills practiced. A positive atmosphere is vital here to maintain enthusiasm. * Evaluation: once the simulation has been completed, it is important to summarize what has been learnt and the effectiveness of the training. Presenting results to others may provide a means of internal assessment, as well as showcasing the players‚Äô achievements. This integrated training will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client,Wenzler, I (2005). Development of an asset management strategy for a network utility company: Lessons from a dynamic business simulation approach. Simulation & Gaming, Vol. 36 No. 1 to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible. Benefits Since training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include: * Business awareness ‚Äì before participating in the training programme, many players will have little idea of how to run a business or what it involves. Simulations allow them to temporarily have control over a virtual company, to see whether their decisions lead them to success or failure!Cruz, Natalia, Escudero, Anna, Barahona, Juan and Leitao, Fernando (2009). The Effect of Entrepreneurship Education Programmes on Satisfaction with Innovation, Behaviour and Performance, Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 33 Iss: 3 * Time management and organization ‚Äì most simulations contain timed sessions, which will test the candidates‚Äô skill in submitting decisions within the allotted time slot.Whicker, Lynn, Marcia and Sigelman, Lee (1991). Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction This is an excellent skill for any employee or graduate. * Team coordination ‚Äì the majority of training simulations involve working in groups or teams of people;Wellington, W. J. and Faria, A. J. (1992). An Examination on the Effect of Team Cohesion, Player Attitude and Performance Expectations on Simulation Performance Results improving the abilities to communicate effectively, delegate tasks and diplomatically resolve any situations. This concept can extend beyond office-based occupations, and is frequently used in public safety contexts. * Problem solving ‚Äì simulations will often present tricky circumstances that must be thought through logically to be solved.Faria, A. J. (2001). The Changing Nature of Business Simulation/Gaming Research: A Brief History. Simulation & Gaming, Vol. 32 No. 1 Successful resolution of these shows good management skills. If every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.Business Simulation Means Better Senior Managers at Heinz, Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 23 Iss: 1 See also * Business game * Business simulation * Business simulation game * Experiential learning * Friday Night at the ER * Microsoft Flight Simulator * Print simulation * Project management simulation * Simulations and games in economics education * Web-based simulation References Category:Business software Category:Learning methods Category:Management education Category:Business education Category:Simulation software ","title":"Training simulation"},{"id":"30518869","text":"Jo√£o Vicente da Nova (born 1 April 1907; date of death unknown) was a Portuguese footballer who played as a midfielder.

It was published as a short book or pamphlet, a form that was popular and which contributed to the lively intellectual life of the time. Greene's work is written as a moralistic tale, which, towards the end, is revealed to have been autobiographical. During the course of the story characters introduce song lyrics, fables, and some sharp and resentful criticisms of actors and playwrights. It appears to have been written with the idea that the contemporary reader would try to figure out which actual persons are being represented and satirised by the characters in the story.Acheson, Arthur. Shakespeare's Lost Years in London, 1586‚Äì1592. Brentanos, 1920, pg 102Greenblatt, Stephen. Will in the World. Jonathan Cape, 2004, pg 212 The pamphlet is most famous for a passage which appears to allude to William Shakespeare, who was then starting out on his career as an actor and playwright. The main body of the text is an account of the visit of two brothers, Roberto and Lucanio, to the courtesan Lamilia. This is followed by the later career of Roberto as a playwright. The actual authorship of the pamphlet has been disputed. Some authorities consider it to be wholly by Greene himself. Others take the view that it is a heavily revised compilation of material left by him. It has also been attributed to the writer and printer Henry Chettle, who arranged its publication. Publication Groatsworth was entered in the Stationers' Register 'upon the peril of Henry Chettle' on 20 September 1592, two and a half weeks after Greene's death on 3 September:'The Registers of the Stationers‚Äô Company, Notes and Queries, 3rd Series, Vol. I, (London: Bell & Daldy, 1862), p. 321. > xxo die Septembr ‚Äì Willm.

Chettle, who had entered into partnership with Danter and William Hoskins in 1591, and who continued to work for Danter for several years after the partnership dissolved, claimed in a prefatory epistle to Kind-Heart's Dream (1592) that, because Greene's handwriting was illegible, he (Chettle) had copied out Greene's manuscript so that the work could be licensed.Jowett, John, 'Johannes Factotum: Henry Chettle and Greene‚Äôs Groatsworth of Wit‚Äô, Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, December 1993, 87:4, pp. 453‚Äì86 at p. 469.Jowett, John, ‚ÄòNotes on Henry Chettle‚Äô, Review of English Studies, August 1994, New Series, 45:180, pp. 384‚Äì8 at p. 385. The publication caused \\"a literary scandal\\" because of its comments about other playwrights.Steve Mentz, \\"Forming Greene ‚Äì theorising the early modern author in the Groatsworth of Wit\\" in Kirk Melnikoff, Edward Gieskes, Writing Robert Greene: essays on England's first notorious professional writer, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, p.115. The booklet was one of several publications that followed Greene's death, occasioned by fascination with his dissolute lifestyle. Others written in the first person purporting to be his dying statements were The Repentance of Robert Greene and Greene's Vision. Groatsworth was reprinted by Thomas Creede in 1596. Contents The pamphlet begins with an account of the brothers Roberto and Lucanio Gorinius, sons of a wealthy usurer. Roberto is a scholar, while Lucanio is being groomed to take over the family business. After their father dies, leaving Roberto only a groat to buy a \\"groat's worth of wit\\", Roberto takes his now wealthy brother to visit the dazzling courtesan Lamilia. Lucanio is enchanted with her. The characters tell fables and comic anecdotes and sing songs. Roberto attempts to make a deal with Lamilia to share the proceeds if she can fleece the naive Lucanio, but Lamilia tells Lucanio about his brother's proposal and kicks Roberto out of the house. Roberto then meets an actor who tells Roberto that he can make a living as a playwright. Two years later Roberto is a successful playwright and Lucanio is penniless, having spent all the money he inherited on Lamilia, who has now discarded him. Roberto employs his brother, but Lucanio leaves and spends the remainder of his life as a pimp. Roberto's success does not stop him from squandering all of his money until he is left dying, once again finding himself with just one groat left. The narrator then states that the life of Roberto is similar to his own, and exhorts his readers to follow a more honourable path, summed up in ten precepts. He then addresses three unnamed \\"Gentlemen his Quondam acquaintance, that spend their wits in making Plaies\\", telling them to reform their ways. One is referred to as a \\"famous gracer of Tragedians\\" who has denied the existence of God. The other is a \\"young Juvenal\\" who co-wrote a comedy with Greene. The third is \\"no lesse deserving than the other two\\" but has been driven to \\"extreme shifts\\" to survive. All should beware of actors and newcomers, especially \\"an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Iohannes fac totum, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey.\\" The pamphlet continues with further exhortations to repentance followed by an allegory about a grasshopper and an ant, the former representing fecklessness, the latter representing thrift. The text ends with a letter to his wife, which is said to have been found after Greene's death. Greene apologises to her for his neglect and exhorts her to look after their son. Identities of the playwrights =Shakespeare reference= The comment about an \\"upstart crow beautified with our feathers\\" is generally accepted as a reference to Shakespeare, who is criticised as an actor who has the temerity to write plays (Iohannes fac totum being a Latin equivalent of \\"Jack of all trades\\"), and is possibly taken to task for plagiarism or excessive pride.D. A. Carroll, \\"The Player-Patron in \\"Greene's Groatsworth of Wit (1592)\\", Studies in Philology, 1994. The line in Groatsworth, \\"Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde\\", alludes to Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 (written c. in 1591), which contains the line \\"O tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\\". (I, iv, 137) Boas, Frederick Samuel, Shakespeare and His Predecessors, New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1900, pp. 540‚Äì1. Marino, James, Owning William Shakespeare: The King‚Äôs Men and their Intellectual Property, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011 p. 35.The line also appears in The True Tragedy of Richard, Duke of York (published 1595), a version of 3 Henry VI (B2 v line 17). Schoone-Jongen, Terence G., Shakespeare's Companies, (Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate Publishing, 2008), p. 28. Scholars are not agreed as to what Greene meant by his cryptic comments or what motivated them. Greene complains of an actor who thinks he can write as well as university-educated playwrights, he alludes to a line in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, and he uses the term \\"Shake-scene,\\" a term never used prior to Groatsworth. Most scholars agree that Greene had Shakespeare in mind, who in 1592 would have been an \\"upstart\\" actor writing and contributing to plays such as the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III, all of which were likely written and produced (although not published) prior to Greene's death.\\"Richard III concludes the first tetralogy of Shakespeare's histories... Most scholars and editors have taken 1592‚Äì1593 as the date of the play's composition.\\", Wolfgang Clemen, Commentary on Shakespeare's Richard III, Routledge, 2013. p. 239. Hanspeter Born has argued that Greene's attack on the \\"upstart Crow\\" was provoked because, in his view, Shakespeare may have rewritten parts of Greene's play A Knack to Know a Knave.Born, Hanspeter, \\"Why Greene was Angry at Shakespeare\\", Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England 25 (2012), 133‚Äì173. Believing that Thomas Nashe is \\"by far the stronger suspect\\" for having written the passage regarding the \\"upstart Crow\\",Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare an Ungentle Life. Methuen Drama. 2001. page 50 Katherine Duncan- Jones points to instances in which Nashe may have had reason to be provoked.Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare an Ungentle Life. Methuen Drama. 2001. page 80 Baldwin MaxwellStudies in Philology 27(2): 230‚Äì232 (1930) and Stephen Greenblatt have speculated that Greene was the model for Shakespeare's Falstaff. Greenblatt has also suggested that a line in Hamlet is a dig at Greene's phrase in Groatsworth, \\"beautified with our feathers\\". Polonius, reading a letter from Hamlet addressed to \\"the most beautified Ophelia\\", comments disparagingly that \\"beautified is a vile phrase\\".Stephen Greenblatt, Will in the World ‚Äì How Shakespeare became Shakespeare, W. W. Norton & Company, 2004, p.215-16 Jenny Sager calls the suggestion that Falstaff was based on Greene fanciful and \\"cringe-worthy\\".Sager, Jenny, \\"Kirk Melnikoff, Ed., Robert Greene\\", Early Modern Literary Studies, Volume: 16, Issue: 1, January 2012. It has also been argued that the reference to the 'Upstart Crow' who was also a 'Shake-scene' applies the famous Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn.Peter Bull (2020) Tired with a Peacock‚Äôs Tail: All Eyes on the Upstart Crow, English Studies, https://doi.org/10.1080/0013838X.2020.1717829 =The three other writers= The three university-educated playwrights addressed by Greene were all notorious for their disreputable lifestyles: a polemical woodcut deriding Thomas Nashe as a jailbird, from Richard Lichfield's The Trimming of Thomas Nashe, Gentleman (1597). The three playwrights whom Greene admonishes were members of a coterie of university-educated writers associated with Greene known as the University Wits.Sarker, Sunil Kumar. Shakespeare's Sonnets. Atlantic Publishers. 2006. page 1. Found online: The \\"famous gracer of Tragedians\\" is generally taken to refer to Christopher Marlowe, educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, who was accused of atheism. Greene comments that he is an admirer of Machiavelli, who is several times mentioned in Marlowe's work. It was once commonly argued that \\"young Juvenal\\" was Thomas Lodge,Felix E. Schelling, English Literature during the Lifetime of Shakespeare, Henry Holt, New York, 1927, p.92E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Volume: 1, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930, p.58 co-author with Greene of the comedy A Looking Glass for London; however, Lodge was out of England at the time, and Greene's language implies that all three playwrights were aware of Greene's illness. Most modern commentators now agree that Greene had in mind Thomas Nashe, educated at St John's College, Cambridge, later called \\"gallant young Juvenal\\" by Francis Meres in Palladis Tamia, an apparent allusion to Greene's earlier use of the epithet.Philip Drew, 'Was Greene's \\"Young Juvenal\\" Nashe or Lodge?', SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900, 1967, 55‚Äì66. Greene's phrase \\"bombast out a blank verse\\" appears to be an allusion to a remark by Nashe in the preface to Greene's Menaphon (1589) in which Nashe defended Greene against his detractors, who \\"out-brave better pens with the swelling bumbast of a bragging blanke verse\\". Nashe was also much younger than Greene, unlike Lodge, which would explain why Greene calls him \\"sweet boy\\". However, there are no known comedies co-written by Greene and Nashe. The third writer is usually identified as George Peele, educated at Christ Church, Oxford, who, like Greene, was notorious for his chaotic lifestyle. Peele may already have collaborated with Shakespeare; the early play Titus Andronicus is now generally taken to have been co-written by them.Bate, Jonathan, and Eric Rasmussen, eds. The RSC Shakespeare: The Complete Works. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, p. 1618: \\"modern scholarship has persuasively demonstrated by means of close stylistic analysis that Titus Andronicus was begun by another dramatist, George Peele, who had a high-level classical education and a taste for large- scale symmetrical stage encounters spoken in high-flown rhetoric.\\" Both Peele and Nashe may also have worked with Shakespeare on Henry VI, Part 1. According to Gary Taylor there is considerable evidence for Nashe's dominant role in the authorship of the first act of the play.Taylor, Gary. \\"Shakespeare and Others: The Authorship of Henry the Sixth, Part One\\", Medieval and Renaissance Drama, 7 (1995), 145‚Äì205. Authorship Some scholars hypothesize that all or part of Groats-Worth was written shortly after Greene's death by one of his fellow writers. Henry Chettle has been the favoured candidate, and was suspected at the time, since the manuscript from which it was printed was prepared by him and was in his handwriting. The publication offended at least two contemporary writers. Chettle responded to the complaints in the preface to his Kind Heart's Dream, published later that year. He denied writing the work, stating that he had only transcribed it from Greene's original manuscript into his own hand before publication. He added that he had no wish to know one of the complainants, but wished he had edited out some of the offensive material about the second. It is widely believed that the two authors he comments on are Christopher Marlowe and Shakespeare, though this is far from certain. Chettle wrote, > About three months since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in > sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, in which a > letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by one or two of them > taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge > in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take > offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I never be. The > other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish I had, for > that, as I have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my > own discretion (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I > did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because > myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality > he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of > dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that > approves his art.Joseph Pearce, The quest for Shakespeare, Ignatius Press, > 2008, p.105 Thomas Nashe was also accused at the time of having written it. He denied it in the 1592 edition of his book Pierce Penniless, calling the work a \\"scald, trivial lying pamphlet\\".Honan, Park, Shakespeare: A Life, Oxford University Press, 1999, p.161 In 1969 Warren B. Austin undertook a pioneering computer- aided analysis of the work of Chettle and Greene. He concluded that Groatsworth was written by Chettle on the basis of word choice frequencies. Austin's analysis convinced many scholars, but in 2006 Richard Westley came to the opposite conclusion, accusing Austin of pre-selecting evidence to support his view. Westley concluded that the pamphlet was the work of Greene and that the evidence of Chettle's quirks was the result of his role as a transcriber.Richard Westley, \\"Computing Error: Reassessing Austin‚Äôs Study of Groatsworth of Wit\\", Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 21, No. 3, 2006 Steve Mentz, writing in 2008, argued that Groatsworth included a substantial amount of material written by Greene, but that its idiosyncratic structure suggested that there was significant editorial intervention in the source material creating \\"an unusual sort of collaboration\\" between Chettle and Greene.

Raised in April 1940 in New South Wales, it formed part of the 20th Brigade, and was eventually allocated to the 9th Division. After completing basic training in Australia, the unit was deployed to the Middle East. In early 1941, it took part in the fighting at Tobruk, defending the port until relieved. A period of garrison duties followed in Syria and Lebanon before the battalion took part in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein in mid-1942. As the focus of the Australian Army's operations shifted to the Pacific theatre to fight the Japanese, the 2/17th Battalion returned to Australia early in 1943. In 1943‚Äì1944, the battalion fought in New Guinea, conducting an amphibious landing as part of operations to capture Lae in early September at the end of the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign, before participating in the follow-up landing on the Huon Peninsula as Japanese forces withdrew inland from Lae. In early 1944, the battalion was withdrawn to Australia for rest and reorganisation and a long period of inactivity followed before it returned to combat. Its final campaign came late in the war when it was committed to the fighting in Borneo in June 1945, landing on Brunei. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in early 1946. History =Formation= Formed for service during the World War II, the 2/17th Battalion was raised on 26 April 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) volunteers at Ingleburn, New South Wales. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time,Long 1952 p. 52. the 2/17th was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons; these were supported by a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons:2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 12‚Äì13. signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars.Kuring 2004, p. 494. Upon formation, the battalion was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Crawford, who had previously served in the Militia and commanded the Sydney University Regiment and the 4th Battalion.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 1. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 17th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were black over green, in a diamond shape. A border of grey was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart. The shape was later changed, though, following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, after which the 2/17th and other 9th Division units were authorised to adopt the 'T'-shaped UCP signifying participation in the siege.Long 1952, pp. 321‚Äì323. After completing individual training at Ingleburn, the battalion moved on foot to Bathurst to complete collective training. Following this, the 2/17th embarked for the Middle East from Sydney on 20 October 1940, on board the Queen Mary.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 8. Moving in convoy the Queen Mary briefly stopped in Fremantle, before continuing to Bombay in early November where the battalion was disembarked. Following a few days in camp ashore they were transferred to the Rohna for the next leg of the voyage. The convoy continued, sailing via the African coast into the Gulf of Aden and then through the Suez Canal, before finally berthing at El Kantara in Egypt.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 9‚Äì15. The battalion was assigned to the 20th Brigade, along with the 2/13th and 2/15th Battalions, which were initially allocated to the 7th Division; however, following its arrival in the Middle East in November 1940, the battalion was transferred along with the rest of the brigade to the 9th Division. =Middle East= Arriving in the Middle East in late November, the battalion undertook further training near Gaza in Palestine, before moving to Port Said in mid-December to relieve the garrison there. Returning to Palestine in early January they conducted a number of exercises until late February.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 16‚Äì19. In March 1941 the battalions of the 9th Division were sent into the desert to relieve the 6th Division that was deploying to Greece; as part of this the 2/17th garrisoned Mersa Brega, near Tripoli. Shortly after this, the Germans landed forces in Africa to reinforce the Italians and the British forces in Libya were forced to retreat from Benghazi to the strategically important port town of Tobruk. The 2/17th fell back as part of the general retreat and subsequently took part in the defence of Tobruk, remaining there for almost seven months during which time the battalion's personnel alternated between conducting patrols in no man's land, raiding, occupying the main defensive position and working in the rear areas.Wilmot 1993, pp. 219, 224 & 238. On the night of 13/14 April 1941, a party of about 30 Germans broke into the Australian position and set up eight machine-guns, a couple of mortars and two field guns.Wilmot 1993, p. 97. Seeing this, the nearest platoon commander, Lieutenant Austin Mackell, launched a counterattack with a small party of men consisting of one corporal and five soldiers.Wilmot 1993, p. 98. Covered by fire from a position on their flank, the small party was able to successfully attack the position, and as a result, Corporal John Edmondson, who single-handedly accounted for a number of Germans despite being mortally wounded, was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the nation's highest military decoration. It was the first such award to a member of the 2nd AIF.Wilmot 1993, p. 99. The battalion's losses during the fighting around Tobruk, including the withdrawal prior to the siege, consisted of 32 dead from all causes, 127 wounded and 14 captured.Johnston 2002, p. 248. alt=A portrait photo of a corporal in service dress uniform Following their relief from Tobruk by units of the British 70th Division, the 2/17th Battalion was evacuated by the sea to Alexandria, and then moved to Palestine, arriving there in mid-October, establishing a camp at Julis.Maughan 1966, p. 514. Shortly afterwards, a company was detached from the battalion to undertake guard duties in Broumane, in Syria, and in January 1942 the rest of the battalion followed. There, they were tasked with undertaking garrison duties as part of the occupation force that had been established there after the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign, to defend against a possible German attack on the Allied flank through the Caucasus. Relieving the 2/12th Battalion, the battalion established itself around Afrine, north of Aleppo; in March, after the 2nd New Zealand Division arrived, the battalion moved to Latakia.Maughan 1966, pp. 515‚Äì516 & 529. Later, in July, as Axis forces launched an offensive in the Western Desert that threatened Egypt, during the First Battle of El Alamein the units of the 9th Division were moved back to North Africa to help stem the advance. The 2/17th Battalion subsequently carried out a blocking operation and then occupied a position around Tel el Eisa,Maughan 1966, p. 618. from where it conducted patrols and observed German movements. In September, the 2/17th was relieved by the 2/15th Battalion, and went into reserve around Shammama to prepare for further operations. The battalion was subsequently tasked with active patrolling in the area, and clashed with German parties on a number of occasions, while its positions were also heavily shelled on a number of occasions which resulted in a few casualties. Meanwhile, several exercises and other training was undertaken prior to the upcoming offensive.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 129‚Äì136. During this time it had an effective strength of 30 officers and 731 other ranks.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 136. In late October and early November 1942, the battalion took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein as the British Commonwealth forces went on the offensive. Engaged on the right of the Allied line around the coast, at dawn on 24 October, the Australians left their assembly area and advanced westward astride the coast road towards Tel el Eisa, and then cut inland towards the \\"Kidney Ridge\\", with the 2/17th on the right of the brigade during the initial advance, attacking with three companies forward.Maughan 1966, pp. 668‚Äì669. As the battle continued, they endured heavy counterattacks as the Germans sought to regain control of the strategically important coast road. Once these had been repelled, the focus of the fighting shifted away from the Australians as British forces were able to launch a break out, which subsequently forced the Germans to withdraw.Coulthard-Clark 1998, pp. 230‚Äì232. The 9th Division was subsequently withdrawn to Gaza. During the battle, the 2/17th was heavily committed, losing 62 men killed in action or died of wounds, 203 wounded and four captured.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 175. =Pacific= In early 1943, along with the rest of the 9th Division, the battalion was brought back to Australia in order to take part in fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. This was the final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions from the Middle East, as the Australian Army's focus had shifted to operations in the Pacific theatre against the Japanese. As part of this process the 6th and 7th Divisions had been brought back to Australia earlier the previous year. Embarking upon the transport Aquitania on 27 January 1943, the battalion sailed as part of a large convoy established as part of Operation Pamphlet; this convoy included the transports Ile de France, Nieuw Amsterdam, and the armed merchant cruiser Queen of Bermuda, and was escorted by HMS Devonshire and several destroyers.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 186‚Äì187. The voyage lasted a month, with the troops arriving in Sydney on 27 February. Converted to the jungle divisional establishment on their return to Australia, the battalions of the 9th Division were reorganised to prepare them for the rigours of jungle warfare. This saw their establishment drop to around 800 men, and the loss of much of their vehicular and heavy equipment. Following training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea where it took part in the Salamaua‚ÄìLae and Huon Peninsula campaigns in 1943‚Äì44. During this time, after concentrating at Milne Bay in August 1943, the 2/17th was involved in the first amphibious landing conducted by Australian soldiers since the landing at Anzac Cove of 25 April 1915, when it took part in the landing at Lae as part of Operation Postern on 4 September 1943.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 213. Lae fell more quickly than the Allied planners expected, and as a result, a quick follow-up operation was planned to secure the Huon Peninsula.Keogh 1965, p. 315. On 22 September, the battalion landed at Scarlet Beach and, tasked with securing the beachhead and the flank,Johnston 2002, p. 158. proceeded to move inland towards Sattelberg as part of efforts to capture Finschhafen.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 224. Finding their way blocked, the battalion later took part in significant actions around Jivevaneng and Kumawa, and then, after Sattelberg finally fell, the drive towards Sio.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 245 and 275. The battalion's casualties during this time amounted to 53 killed in action, 10 died of wounds, five died from accident, and 160 wounded in action.Johnston 2002, p. 249. In March 1944, the battalion returned to Australia for rest and re-organisation, sailing on the transport Clip Fontain. Although the Australian Army had been heavily committed to combat operations in the Pacific in the early years of the war against Japan, by 1944 the United States military had assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the Pacific and this had resulted in uncertainty about the role of the Australian Army in future operations.Johnston 2005, p. 14.Dexter 1961, p. 763. As a result, a long period of training followed, and there was a significant turn over of personnel within the 9th Division as many men were discharged due to medical reasons or transferred to other units and young replacements were brought in.Johnston 2002, p. 186. After concentrating at Ravenshoe in May 1944, the battalion was rebuilt, focusing on individual training and then collective training up to battalion level. After this, in September 1944, the battalion moved to Trinity Beach, close to Cairns, where amphibious training was conducted. Further training continued throughout October and November 1944. At the end of the year, the tempo dropped off and the battalion's personnel were occupied with sporting activities prior to leave in February and March 1945. Finally, in early May 1945, the battalion moved to Townsville where it boarded the transport David C. Shanks, bound for Morotai Island.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 284‚Äì288. alt=A landing ship disembarks troops On Morotai, the 2/17th concentrated along with the rest of the 9th Division, which had been allocated to take part in operations to recapture Borneo as part of Operation Oboe. The battalion's part in this plan saw them land on Brunei on 10 June 1945 as part of Operation Oboe Six. Coming ashore near Brooketon,2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 487. the battalion took part in capturing the capital before dispatching companies to secure individual objectives in the outlying areas as the Australians advanced along the coast towards the oilfields at Seria. In mid-July, 'D' Company carried out a patrol along the Baram River on board HMAS Tiger Snake.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 313‚Äì314. On 13 August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the order to cease offensive action was received from 20th Brigade headquarters and two days later the war came to an end with Japan's capitulation. Despite this, it was not until 10 September that the Japanese on Borneo formally surrendered, and the bulk of the battalion remained deployed until the end of the month. During this time they were involved in ensuring all Japanese forces in the area received the surrender instructions and complied with them, and with collecting and escorting surrendered Japanese soldiers and former Indian prisoners of war, with the battalion's last operation being completed in early October.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 317‚Äì318. The battalion's final campaign cost 24 men killed or wounded.Long 1963, p. 501. =Disbandment= Following the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began,James 2009, p. 14. and personnel began to be repatriated to Australia to return to civilian life or were transferred to units of the 34th Brigade for further service during the occupation of Japan. On 29 October, the battalion was declared \\"redundant\\" and was transferred to Labuan having been withdrawn from the Seria area; personnel were subsequently occupied with various sporting competitions and education programs intended to help them transition into civilian life upon their return to Australia.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 318. This return was eagerly awaited, but the Australian troops remained for several months until British and Indian troops arrived to relieve the 9th Division of its occupation duties.Long 1963, p. 565. In mid-December what remained of the 2/17th embarked upon the Pachaug Victory for the return to Australia. Arriving in Brisbane, from there the battalion's personnel moved to Sydney and went on Christmas leave. On 8 February 1946, while at Ingleburn, the 2/17th Battalion was disbanded. During the course of the war, a total of 2,903 personnel served in the battalion, of whom 177 were killed in action or died of wounds, three died on active service, 542 were wounded in action and 18 were taken prisoner.Johnston 2002, p. 247. Members of the 2/17th received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, four Distinguished Service Orders and one bar, one British Empire Medal, 11 Military Crosses, three Distinguished Conduct Medals, 11 Military Medals and 46 Mentions in Despatches. In addition, three members of the battalion were appointed Officers of the Order of the British Empire, and one was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In 1997, a memorial to the 2/17th Battalion was built at Jivevaneng.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, pp. 273-274, 366.

The current museum opened in April 2010 and rehoused the former collection originally held in converted fishermen's cottages behind the main street. History Sheringham has a recorded history going back over a thousand years, but there is also evidence of Roman and Viking settlement in the area. The town's name is thought to derive from a Viking village ('Scira's Home'). The original museum was located in converted fishermen's cottages and washhouses in the heart of the town, and was obviously unable to accommodate a growing collection which included three of the town's restored lifeboats. Solving the space problem - The Mo The Mo was originally a house named after Morag, born 1881, daughter of Sir Thomas Digby Pigott a member of the Upcher family. Richard Frederick Hayward, M.C., K.C., a maritime lawyer and farmer, was the last owner. The military requisitioned the property in 1940 and although initially intended as a defensive stronghold against invading forces, it was principally used to train troops in house to house fighting. Badly damaged, it was pulled down in 1946 and the site was then used as an open-air bandstand and children‚Äôs playground. Anglian Water acquired the site in 1996 from North Norfolk District Council in order to build a multimillion- pound sewerage scheme for the town, in return they built an ‚Äòamenity building‚Äô on the top of a massive storm and overflow tank, and although this new building was leased to the District Council it remained empty until 2009 when NNDC and Anglian Water allowed the lease to be transferred to Sheringham Museum Trust. In April 2010, the museum reopened in a new facility located in \\"The Mo\\". Displays focus on the town's social history, its fishing industry and its development as a holiday resort.

Adriaen Cornelisz. van Linschoten Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was in any case, not a proponent of \\"wellevenskunst\\" (virtue), since Houbraken felt Linschoten's painting style and lifestyle were both far from virtuous. In 1634 Linschoten travelled to Brabant where he married and had two daughters. He returned with his family to Delft, where Pieter Jansz van Ruyven knew him as an old man in 1677 or 1678 and admired his work. Ruyven remembered specifically a story where a church pastor had ordered a painting of Paul the Apostle showing sorrow for his sins and crying to the servant girl of the high priests, and when Linschoten asked if he had painted the \\"crybaby\\" well enough, \\"since though he had been drunk and sorry himself, he had never cried about it enough to feel the emotion\\", the patron was so insulted he refused to buy the painting from such a heathen, though he admired it greatly. Houbraken saw a painting by Linschoten at the home of a gunpowder manufacturer named Mr. Van der Heul in Delft outside the Waterloose Poort. It was a painting of an alchemist in his studio, and Houbraken liked it very much. According to the RKD he was a pupil of Joris van Lier in 1623 and then travelled to Italy, but was back in 1634 when he became a member of the Delft Guild of St. Luke. He moved to The Hague in 1646 but was banned from the city more than once for disorderly conduct.

Schemes inviting workers include Balt Cygnet and later Westward Ho!. In spite its name, Balt Cygnet also accepted applicants from the Ukraine, Poland and countries in the Balkans, among others. History The relatively high level of economic growth in the UK during the post-war period led an acute labour shortage within key sectors. EVWs were first and foremost invited in order to cover the need for low-paid and unskilled work. The majority of EVWs originated in Ukraine, Poland and Latvia. Since many of these people were displaced because of World War II, also a humanitarian element has been attributed to some of the EVW schemes. In total some 91.000 people came to the UK between 1946 and 1949 under the various EVW schemes. EVWs were initially referred to as ‚ÄòDisplaced Persons‚Äô, since many of the arrivals had been displaced by World War II. This term was however replaced by ‚ÄòEVW‚Äô due to its derogatory connotations. In 1953 the term ‚ÄòEVW‚Äô was replaced with simply ‚ÄòForeign Workers recruited under the Westward Ho scheme‚Äô.D. Kay and R. Miles, Refugees or Migrant Workers? European Volunteer Workers in Britain 1946-51, 1992. Some of the schemes in place, such as Balt Cygnet, did not make any provisions for dependents. This also raises questions of the humanitarian aspirations of the British government. These schemes did however experience problems with recruitment, and the most successful scheme ‚ÄòWestward Ho!' did accommodate for both children and spouses. EVWs who came to the UK were generally paid the same wage and had the same rights as British workers. Some did however experience discrimination, especially within trades with strong trade unions. They were for instance often refused positions with more responsibility and were in some places fired before British workers in the case of redundancies.

Consisting of a very large fluviatile shell midden, it flourished in particular from 1500 BC to 500 BC. Excavations at Samrong Sen, which started in the 1880s, have been described as the earliest prehistoric archaeological studies which gave credence to the concept of Southeast Asian Bronze Age.Miksic (2003), p. 208 Excavations conducted to depths of stratifications have revealed that Samrong Sen provides a link to the professional skills and burial practices of the Bronze Age communities who lived in the Banchiang area on the banks of the Chinit River. As Samrong Sen was almost the only known prehistoric settlement in Cambodia for many years, it was visited by many archaeologists and its artefacts were studied by scientists in several countries. It has been characterized as a highly developed Stone Age culture in Indo-China. History Though various spellings have been presented, \\"Samrong Sen\\" is considered to be correct. The site was first discovered and reported in 1876 by M. Rouques, Director of the Fluvial Transportation Company. Samrong Sen was subject to archaeological excavation from the late 19th century through the end of the 19th century, and also into the 20th century. The excavations show close relationship with Neolithic sites in South East Asia and also many Pacific Islands.Sophady (2007), pp. 1‚Äì4 They have revealed that the people who lived at Samrong Sen during the Bronze Age were very similar to the ancestors of the Funanese. Archaeological history of the village in general and the research finding of the archaeological site in particular have been reported by archaeologists Corre in 1879, Fuchs in 1882 and 1883, Mansuy in 1902, Mourer in 1994, Vanna in 1999, and many Cambodian archaeologists and researchers.Sophady (2007), pp. 4‚Äì7 ;Initial villager excavations Initial finds at Samrong Sen were by villagers' excavations while extracting for hydrated lime from shell excavations at this site; these initial finds were handed over by the villagers to the missionaries.Sophady (2007), p.92 After the first excavations of 1876 in the flood plains of Tonl√© Sap, additional excavations were carried out by archaeologists at different locations within this site. Many of the large size collections made from the site during several excavations could have been from casual surface excavations and hence no specific methodology could be explained.Sophady (2007), p.92 ;19th century The earliest artefacts were found by Lieutenant Jean Moura in 1876; he was the Representative of the French protectorate of Cambodia in 1864. The stray archaeological finds were transported to France where they were analysed and interpreted. The Fuchs report of 1883 stated that the top layer consisted of recent flood deposit (inferred from recent pottery). Below this layer were shell lenses which contained black pytahanite, gouges, and chisels. There were also marine shell bracelets, as well as pottery vessels with varying type of incisions. Comparing it with the Mekong delta sediment deposits, Fuch inferred that the site existed a few centuries prior to the advent of Christian Epoch. These excavations also inferred that the site belonged to the Bronze Age on the basis of a comparison of the archaeological finds of similar sites in Thailand and Vietnam. Henri Alphonse Mansuy and Olov Janse, archaeologist from Sweden who found or purchased many of the artefacts, could not date them correctly since the carbon dating technique was not known at that time. The occupational sequence of the site could not be correctly assessed. ;20th century Systematic excavations with stratigraphic control started in 1902, and again in 1923 by Mansuy. Three layers were identified, which revealed shell lenses up to depth. Arm bands and beads found here have similarity with those found in the Mekong sites. Pottery found here was not of any decorative type. Graves, however, gave many finds of fully formed bronze vessels. Excavations carried out in stratified layers have unearthed late Stone Age ceramics and also human remains, out of which many layers are dated 2000 BC, as per radiocarbon dating methods. However, the bronze collections were not found from excavations carried out in stratified layers. Several observations were made on the claims of archaeologists during the early stages of the excavations such as they were overzealous and that they over stated when presenting their findings. Prior to the World War II, the site was again excavated by Janse. He collected many artefacts, which were examined in 1986 by Robert E. Murowchick of Boston University. During these excavations, a crucible (with remnants of scoria) was also found along with bracelets, socketed spearheads, axes and a bell. Chemical analysis of five antiquaries indicated 11.74 to 26.47% of lead which verifies that the technological techniques of casting and annealing were known during the period. However, the bronze items have been dated to late 200 BC. In 1994, radiocarbon dating by Roland Mourer suggests the prehistoric sequence for Samrong Sen as lying between 3400 BC and 500 AD. This has been confirmed by the Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analysis, a methodology adopted to determine the concentration of carbon-14. Finds of Mansuy were further examined by French archaeologists in 1998 for human skeletons. This study identified three fully preserved skulls. In addition, 20 mandibles and several post-cranial ones found here established that these belonged to at least 20 people.Sophady (2007), p.8 Also found was a bronze mould and various arrowheads, axeheads, chisels and fish hooks etc. Geography Samrong Sen is located in central Cambodia on the east bank of the Stueng Chinit River, in the flood plains of the Tonl√© Sap River, near the ancient capital of Oudong. The site is approachable from the Kampong Chhnang, which is away. The village below which the prehistoric archaeological finds are found, is a rugged mound of elliptical shape with a length of 600 m laid in a north-south direction. In the first report made by Edmond Fuchs in 1883, the site was identified as covering an area of by .Higham (1996), pp. 22‚Äì23 It was about to above the Chinit River during low flow season. While parts of the site were exploited in the 1930s, the surviving portion as of the 1960s, is situated on the right bank of the Strung-Kinit, a rivulet within the waterway that flows from the Kompong-Leng mountains into the Tonl√© Sap. The site is approached along the waterway by inland transport from Kampong Chhnang port across the Tonl√© Sap Lake via the Steung Chinit River. The road approach is, however, seasonal only on a non-monsoon road. The Samrong Sen village, where the archaeological site is situated, is in the Kampong Leaeng District in the lacustrine flood plains, an area which is subject to backwater flooding from the Tonl√© Sap lake and the Mekong River flows during the months of June to September (rainy season). The area gets exposed during the dry season from October to May when bush vegetation and water plants grow here and fishing is common vocation. The villagers subsist on hydrated lime extraction from the shells and fishing, activities that were recorded by the earliest researchers of the site and which had continued till the 1930s. As of 1999, 1237 people lived here in 235 stilt houses. A school and a Buddhist Pagoda were also reported in the village.Sophady (2007), pp. 5‚Äì7 Fauna Excavations uncovered bones of faunal species (cattle, pig, dog) and aqua species (crocodile, water turtle and shell fish). Shell fish bones extracted from depths of were subject to carbon dating which has fixed the age of the site around 1650¬±120 BC. Findings Morphological characteristics of the tools have been the basis for the categorization of the Samrong Sen stone tools. The adzes, axes, shouldered adzes, shouldered axes, gouges, chisels, a burnisher, a tool used as a hammer are the eight identified categories. The most common tools found were adzes, followed by chisels and gouges. Axes and shouldered axes were very few. In the early excavation stages, flakes, debris, pre-forms and unfinished tools were not part of the collections. Further, though tool-manufacturing techniques could not be correctly discerned, it has been inferred after careful study of the tools that picking or flaking was the initial step followed by partial, edge, and full grinding. It has also been conjectured that sawing techniques were used. The adzes have quadrangular sections similar to those found in Indo-China, Southern Thailand, Myanmar, and even India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. The stone gouges are linked to similar ones found in Marianas. Other antiquaries included ceramics, stone tools (adzes), a decorated bronze bell (19.7 cm in height), bone spear, harpoon shafts and human remains. Polished stone tools were used for wood working activities and pottery vessels and were produced by professionals. It has been inferred: \\"Standardization in polished stone toll forms and functions was one of the socioeconomic changes experienced by the societies that lived in the flood plain zone of the Tonl√© Sap during the transition of Neolithic and Metal periods in Cambodia.\\" On the basis of studies carried out in ancient archaeological sites in Thailand the occupation of the area in the Neolithic period has also been inferred through the remains unearthed at the Samrong Sen site, as establishing occupation during Bronze Age (after 2000 BC). There is a certain degree of confusion in this dating since it has been noted that \\"Neolithic/Bronze Age periods are poorly separated\\" at the Cambodian sites.Miksic (2003) pp. 213‚Äì214 Other observations showed that the ceramics contained decoration that are incised or impressed, a stylish technology which could exist at other locations; an earthenware vase mounted on a pedestal (reported by Mansuy in 1902 and in Mourer in 1971) attests to the polished stone adzes of the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age and are found in the adjoining countries of Thailand and Vietnam; stylistic changes have been recorded in the stratigraphic sequences such as in the curvilinear geometric ware. With findings of bronzes, arrow heads, hooks, bracelets, an axe, and a sandstone mould for axes, the excavations have also bridged the information gap between the Bronze Age with the excavations done at Angkor Borei. The Bronze Age manufacturing of bronze finds at Samrong Sen and other sites in Cambodia are inferred to have been the outcome of supplies of ingots of copper received from central or northeastern Thailand, as Cambodia lacked any copper resources in its own territory. The finished bronze products produced in Cambodia are, however, testified by the large quantity of moulds and workshop remnants found during excavations. It was also revealed that the settlers of Samrong Sen lived in bamboo houses on stilts, much like today Ciseau poli MHNT PRE 2004 0 132 Moura Somrong Sen.jpgChisel - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Hache √† √©paulement MHNT PRE 2004 0 135 Moura Somrong Sen.jpgShouldered axes - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Hache √† √©paulement MHNT PRE 2004 0 169 Moura Somrong Sen.jpgShouldered axes - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Disque auriculaire, Somrong, Sen MHNT PRE 2013 0 569 Jean Moura.jpgEar stretching plug - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Rondelle en pierre poli MHNT PRE 2004 0 572 Moura Somrong Sen.jpgJade ornaments - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Samrong Sen Parure MHNT PRE 2013 0 570.jpgNecklace - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Samrong Sen Parure MHNT PRE 2013 0 571 Moura.jpgNecklace - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Samrong Sen Vase MHNT.PRE.2013.0.579.jpgCeramic bowl decorated - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Samrong Sen Vase MHNT.PRE.2013.0.578.jpgCeramic vase - former collection of Jean Moura MHNT Collections The 1864 Moura collection of 18 items is housed in the Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle de Toulouse, along with the undated finds of F.

One of the earliest and most well-known examples is the collection by the artists Yoshitoshi and Yoshiiku from the 1860s, which depicted several gruesome acts of murder or torture based on historical events or scenes in Kabuki plays.Forbes, Andrew; Henley, David (2012). 28 Famous Murders. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. Reception Although most of the works are solely violent by nature, it is perhaps the first known example of ero guro or the erotic grotesque in Japanese culture, an art subgenre which depicts either erotic or extreme images of violence and mutilation. The Muzan-e has influenced many modern day art formats and ero guro can be found in manga with the works of Suehiro Maruo, Shintaro Kago or Toshio Maeda; in many live action films such as the pink film movement and most of the works of director Takashi Miike and even non-Japanese artists such as Trevor Brown. Muzan translates from Japanese as cruelty or atrocity, and the works were said to spread a general panic amongst the populace at the time of publishing, with the extreme violence depicted in the paintings taken as a sign of social and moral decline. =References to the Muzan-e in other media= * Suehiro Maruo, a manga artist whose works are heavily influenced by the original woodcuts, and artist Kazuichi Hanawa, created a modern version of the Muzan-e in 1988 with an art book entitled Bloody Ukiyo-e.

It was founded on 8 August 1885 as a result of the will of Goethe's last living heir, his grandson Walther von Goethe, who left the Goethe House to the state. After the Land of Thuringia was formed, the Goethe- Nationalmuseum, along with several buildings erected during the classical age and the Weimar palaces, became the property of Thuringia. In the 1920s, more Weimar buildings were assigned to the Goethe-Nationalmuseum. In 1953, these buildings became the property of the ‚ÄúNationale Forschungs- und Gedenkst√§tten der klassischen deutschen Literatur in Weimar, NFG‚Äù (national research establishments and memorials of the German classical literature in Weimar). Since October 1991, the Goethe-Nationalmuseum belongs to the ‚ÄúKlassik Stiftung Weimar‚Äù (foundation of Weimar classicism) which succeeded the NFG. It administers the main house and 22 other historical houses and museums throughout and around the Weimar municipal area. Exhibits and research In Goethe's residential building, situated at the Weimar place \\"Frauenplan\\", visitors can view the rooms in which he and his wife, Christiane Vulpius, lived, at Goethe's study and library, the reception room, the rooms where the art collection was stored, and the garden. The house also contains research facilities, including the ‚ÄúStudiensaal‚Äù, an institution used during the age of Goethe which is similar to a congress or conference centre today. The Goethe- Nationalmuseum consists of Goethe's residential building and the \\"Goethe- Museum\\". This museum is situated in an extension that was built in 1935 next to the house. The exhibits largely consist of Goethe's collections in the domains of arts and natural science, his library, and about 2,000 drawings he did himself. The collection comprises about 100,000 exhibits and focuses on the period of Weimar Classicism.

Scott Pilarz, was named President of Marquette University in September 2010. Pilarz had served as president at Scranton since 2003. A search was launched by the University of Scranton to find a successor. On December 15, 2010, the University of Scranton's board of trustees, under chairman Christopher \\"Kip\\" Condron, unanimously voted to appoint Father Kevin Quinn as the University's 25th president. Father Quinn took office as the University of Scranton's 25th president on July 1, 2011. His official inauguration took place on Friday, September 16, 2011, at the William J.

An inaugural concert held on September 17, 2011, included a new composition based on Philippians 4:4-8, described as Quinn's favorite passage from the Bible: \\"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.\\" Quinn has stated that a priority is maintaining the price of higher education in order to keep pace with prevailing economic demographics in Northeast Pennsylvania. He resided in Condron Hall, a University of Scranton dorm, joking with local media, \\"It‚Äôs partly selfish. You live with 20-year-olds, it keeps you younger.\\" On August 22, 2016, Father Quinn announced he would step down as University President, effective June 1, 2017.

Raised in York, Pennsylvania, he graduated from Lebanon Valley College with a Bachelor of Music Education and from the University of Michigan with a Master of Music in choral conducting. In August 1980 he played an instrumental role in founding the New York City Gay Men's Chorus (NYCGMC). He served as the NYCGMC's first director from 1980 to 1998. He later returned as director for one season in 2005. During his tenure the chorus notably became the first gay musical ensemble to receive a recording contract. He also commissioned 40 new choral works by numerous notable American composers. Under his baton, the chorus performed more than 50 concerts in Carnegie Hall and completed three European tours.  Family/Early life  Born into a dysfunctional family, Miller had always struggled with his identity, according to his family. His mother and father struggled to get along, worsening his condition among his three siblings, Don (living), Randy (living), and Barbara (deceased 2016). The first person he confided in was his older sister, Barbara, who, as it is told, was irritated and disgusted with Gary for seeing his sexual disposition as an issue. Gary's extended family is extensively large, with his brother Don having over 10 grandchildren.  Accomplishments  Under Miller's leadership the NYCGMC operated not only as a musical ensemble but as a political and social organization. In a 2005 interview in The New York Times Miller said of the chorus, \\"As gay men we wanted to make music for the education and enrichment of the community. It was to be equal parts music, social and political.\\" In 1984 the chorus performed at the Eastern Division Conference of the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA). It was the first time that the ACDA had featured a gay chorus at one of its conventions.\\"Gay Men's Chorus Wins Right To Use Name In S.J.\\", San Jose Mercury News, January 29, 1986 The ACDA had initially refused to allow the chorus to use the word gay in their printed program; a decision which prompted Miller to file a successful lawsuit against the organization with the backing of the American Civil Liberties Union. He also led the chorus in several AIDS benefits which helped raise awareness of the disease as well as bring in funding for medical research.  Current life  Miller currently teaches at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York City and is married to Daniel Starr.

It was described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1870. It is known from Honduras and possibly Mexico. Taxonomy Lophocampa albiguttata was treated as a synonym of Lophocampa alternata by Allan Watson and David T. Goodger in 1986. A comparison of the type material has revealed a clear difference in these two taxa, in particular the forewing pattern. Lophocampa albiguttata was therefore raised from synonymy in 2011. In the original description, Boisduval does not indicate the number of syntypes, based on specimens from Honduras. A female specimen from the Boisduval collection bears a label \\"Oaxaca\\", [Mexico] and a red \\"type\\" label. This specimen from Oaxaca may be a syntype of L. albiguttata, although the species was described from Honduras. A locality error in the original description or labelling error could explain this contradiction. As there is some doubt about the status of this supposed type, the designation of a lectotype or neotype is currently not possible. It is also possible that a syntype is stored in another collection. Finally, no specimens from Honduras have been located to serve as potential neotype.

He is the co-editor (with Maria Tymoczko) of Translation and Power (University of Massachusetts Press, 2002). In his work Contemporary Translation Theories (1993) Gentzler examines modern approaches to translation studies, such as the translation workshop, the science of translation, translation studies, polysystem theory, and deconstruction, all of which began in the mid-1960s and continue to be influential today. He explores the strengths and weaknesses of each method, tracing the connections among the different schools of thought. Illustrating the importance of translation theory to the current debates in cultural studies, Gentzler raises theoretical questions challenging assumptions of the leading translation theories.Review of Contemporary Translation Theories at Iberlibro In Translation and Identity in the Americas, Gentzler looks at the development of translation in Brazil, Latin America, Canada, and the Caribbean, suggesting that translation is integral to cultural construction and identity formation in the Americas. In Translation and Rewriting in the Age of Post-Translation Studies, he argues that texts no longer simply move across borders, but circulate internationally and intersemiotically into multiple languages, media, and forms.

After Jane Duncan died in 1976, Hedderwick was encouraged by her editor to take the plunge and write and illustrate her own stories. However it was not until 1984, three publishers later, that the first of Hedderwick's Katie Morag stories, Katie Morag Delivers the Mail, finally appeared in print inspired by her time on Coll. The book was well received, and three more Katie Morag picturebooks rapidly followed in the next three years. Hedderwick's marriage came to an end in the mid-1980s, and with her children now educated, she gave up a part-time job with the Highlands and Islands Development Board advising community co-operatives and in 1990 moved back to Coll, first letting and then fully buying back the house at Crossapol, where she found her children's childhood pictures still on the walls. In her next Katie Morag book, Katie Morag and the New Pier (1993), she addressed the issue of an island that was changing fast from the remote isolated place she had known in the 1960s. Another four Katie Morag books followed, but increasingly Hedderwick began to find herself becoming a not-entirely-willing tourist attraction on Coll in her own right, and after almost ten years she felt it was time to move on. Five years in the Scottish Borders followed, succeeded by several years restoring a pair of cottages near Jemimaville on the Black Isle looking over the Cromarty Firth; but neither felt quite right, so in 2005 she decided to return again to Coll, where she had a new house built close to her daughter and grandchildren.

In 2016, the building was sold to Chinese developers Xinyuan Real Estate who announced plans for a 16-story luxury condominium tower in the space. The new building, which will keep the original facade over the lower floors, will be designed by the firm of I.M. Pei. The demolition of the theater began in earnest in November 2019. The decorative plasterwork of the landmarked lobby had been previously cut into numbered sections and removed to a warehouse. It is intended to install these in the new structure. Preservation It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1984, the theater's ticket lobby and grand foyer were designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. A group called the \\"Committee to Save the RKO Keith's Theatre of Flushing, Inc.\\" (which dates its work back to 1981) worked to gain community support as part of its goal to maintain and preserve RKO Keith's Theater for adaptive re-use as a performing arts/convention center. In 1986-87 over 3,000 Queens residents signed petitions in order to request that the entire structure be granted \\"landmark status\\" by New York City.Zambito, Thomas. \\"Keith's At Center Stage.\\" Queens Tribune. December 18, 1986 The petitions were submitted to Borough President Claire Shulman, who refused to support landmark status for the entire interior, which had been the original intention of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Committee's co- founder, Jerry Rotondi, in support of this goal, stated, \\"A lot have stories to tell. One man proposed to his wife in the balcony of the theater; another said his father used to supply the goldfish that swam in the main lobby's fountain, a nickel a fish. His father caught those fish in Kissena Park Pond.\\" After several residents learned that the RKO Keith's Theater was purchased by developer Thomas Huang, who intended to build a \\"350-room international hotel\\" in Flushing, the committee grew and took action. The Committee gained support from the Theater Historical Society, Queens Historical Society, New York Landmarks Conservancy, Queensborough Preservation League and State Senator Frank Padavan. Queens Historical Society wrote a letter to Rotondi, which stated, \\"The Committee's work to protect a recognized landmark from insensitive development and inappropriate use... (is) very commendable.\\" At the start of 1989, RKO Keith's interior landmark was struck by vandalism; \\"two sets of bronze doors\\" were stolen along with their frames. In order to properly ascertain this problem, Jerry Rotondi and requested a thorough inspection from the Landmarks Preservation Commission; this was done after Rotondi realized the \\"plywood barrier around the construction site had been broken.\\"Colangelo, Lisa L. \\"Landmark Vandalized.\\" Queens Tribune. January 26, 1989 After completing their survey of the interior damages, both Richard McTighe (the landmarks preservationist) and Huang unanimously decided that a \\"new gate\\" should be built \\"between the plywood barrier and the designated space.\\" In 2009, preservationists sought to purchase RKO Keith's Theater in the hopes of reusing or renovating it as a performing arts center with two objectives, \\"to honor its storied past and once again entertain the community.\\" The theater's price was valued at $24 million. In order to fully revitalize the theater, preservationists and fans, referred to as the \\"Friends of RKO Keith's,\\" sought to collect donations from various film stars.

Note the almost spherical shape of the outside edge of the plasma. The high elongation is also evident, notably the filaments extending off the top and bottom near the central conductor. A spherical tokamak is a type of fusion power device based on the tokamak principle. It is notable for its very narrow profile, or aspect ratio. A traditional tokamak has a toroidal confinement area that gives it an overall shape similar to a donut, complete with a large hole in the middle. The spherical tokamak reduces the size of the hole as much as possible, resulting in a plasma shape that is almost spherical, often compared with a cored apple. The spherical tokamak is sometimes referred to as a spherical torus and often shortened to ST. The spherical tokamak is an offshoot of the conventional tokamak design. Proponents claim that it has a number of substantial practical advantages over these devices. For this reason the ST has generated considerable interest since the late 1980s. However, development remains effectively one generation behind traditional tokamak efforts like JET. Major experiments in the ST field include the pioneering START and MAST at Culham in the UK, the US's NSTX-U and Russian Globus-M. Research has investigated whether spherical tokamaks are a route to lower cost reactors. Further research is needed to better understand how such devices scale. Even in the event that STs do not lead to lower cost approaches to power generation, they are still lower cost in general; this makes them attractive devices for studying plasma physics, or as high-energy neutron sources.  Background  =Basic fusion physics= The basic idea behind fusion is to force two suitable atoms close enough together that the strong force pulls them together to make a single larger atom. This process releases a considerable amount of binding energy, typically in the form of high-speed subatomic particles like neutrons or beta particles. However, these same fuel atoms also experience the electromagnetic force pushing them apart. In order for them to fuse, they must be pressed together with enough energy to overcome this coulomb barrier. The simplest way to do this is to heat the fuel to very high temperatures, and allow the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution to produce a number of very high-energy atoms within a larger, cooler mix. For the fusion to occur, the higher speed atoms have to meet, and in the random distribution that will take time. The time will be reduced by increasing the temperature, which increases the number of high-speed particles in the mix, or by increasing the pressure, which keeps them closer together. The product of temperature, pressure and time produces the expected rate of fusion events, the so-called fusion triple product. To be useful as a net energy exporter, the triple product has to meet a certain minimum condition, the Lawson criterion. In practical terms, the required temperatures are on the order of 100 million degrees. This leads to problems with the two other terms; confining the fuel at a high enough pressure and for a long enough time is well beyond the capabilities of any known material. However, at these temperatures the fuel is in the form of an electrically conductive plasma, which leads to a number of potential confinement solutions using magnetic or electrical fields. Most fusion devices use variations of these techniques. Tokamaks are the most researched approach within the larger group of magnetic fusion energy (MFE) designs. They attempt to confine a plasma using powerful magnetic fields. Tokamaks confine their fuel at low pressure (around 1/millionth of atmospheric) but high temperatures (150 million Celsius), and attempt to keep those conditions stable for ever-increasing times on the order of seconds to minutes.Many advanced tokamak designs routinely hit numbers on the order of ~ 1 √ó 1021 keV ‚Ä¢ seconds / m¬≥, see \\"Fusion Triple Product and the Density Limit of High-Density Internal Diffusion Barrier Plasmas in LHD\\", 35th EPS Conference on Plasma Phys. Hersonissos, 9‚Äì13 June 2008 Doing so, however, requires massive amount of power in the magnetic system, and any way to reduce this improves the overall energy efficiency of the system. = Energy balance = Ideally, the energy needed to heat the fuel would be made up by the energy released from the reactions, keeping the cycle going. Anything over and above this amount could be used for power generation. This leads to the concept of the Lawson criterion, which delineates the conditions needed to produce net power.John Lawson, \\"Some Criteria for a Power Producing Thermonuclear Reactor\\", Proceedings of the Physical Society B, Volume 70 (1957), p. 6 When the fusion fuel is heated, it will naturally lose energy through a number of processes. These are generally related to radiating terms like blackbody radiation, and conduction terms, where the physical interaction with the surrounding carries energy out of the plasma. The resulting energy balance for any fusion power device, using a hot plasma, is shown below. :P_\\\\text{net} = \\\\eta_\\\\text{capture}\\\\left(P_\\\\text{fusion} - P_\\\\text{conduction} - P_\\\\text{radiation}\\\\right) where: * P_\\\\text{net}, is the net power out * \\\\eta_\\\\text{capture}, is the efficiency with which the plant captures energy, say through a steam turbine, and any power used to run the reactor * P_\\\\text{fusion}, is the power generated by fusion reactions, basically a function of the rate of reactions * P_\\\\text{conduction}, is the power lost through conduction to the reactor body * P_\\\\text{radiation}, is the power lost as light, leaving the plasma, typically through gamma radiation To achieve net power, a device must be built which optimizes this equation. Fusion research has traditionally focused on increasing the first P term: the fusion rate. This has led to a variety of machines that operate at ever higher temperatures and attempt to maintain the resulting plasma in a stable state long enough to meet the desired triple product. However, it is also essential to maximize the Œ∑ for practical reasons, and in the case of a MFE reactor, that generally means increasing the efficiency of the confinement system, notably the energy used in the magnets. = Beta number = A measure of success across the magnetic fusion energy world is the beta number. Every machine containing plasma magnetically, can be compared using this number. \\\\beta = \\\\frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \\\\frac{n k_B T}{(B^2/2\\\\mu_0)}Wesson, J: \\"Tokamaks\\", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004 This is the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic field pressure.John Wesson and David Campbell, \\"Tokamaks\\", Clarendon Press, 2004, pg. 115 Improving beta means that you need to use, in relative terms, less energy to generate the magnetic fields for any given plasma pressure (or density). The price of magnets scales roughly with Œ≤¬Ω, so reactors operating at higher betas are less expensive for any given level of confinement. Conventional tokamaks operate at relatively low betas, the record being just over 12%, but various calculations show that practical designs would need to operate as high as 20%. =Aspect ratio= The limiting factor in reducing beta is the size of the magnets. Tokamaks use a series of ring-shaped magnets around the confinement area, and their physical dimensions mean that the hole in the middle of the torus can be reduced only so much before the magnet windings are touching. This limits the aspect ratio, A = R/a, of the reactor to about 2.5; the diameter of the reactor as a whole could be about 2.5 times the cross-sectional diameter of the confinement area. Some experimental designs were slightly under this limit, while many reactors had much higher A. History = Reducing aspect ratio = During the 1980s, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), led by Ben Carreras and Tim Hender, were studying the operations of tokamaks as A was reduced. They noticed, based on magnetohydrodynamic considerations, that tokamaks were inherently more stable at low aspect ratios. In particular, the classic \\"kink instability\\" was strongly suppressed. Other groups expanded on this body of theory, and found that the same was true for the high-order ballooning instability as well. This suggested that a low-A machine would not only be less expensive to build, but have better performance as well.Sykes 2008, pg. 10 In the traditional tokamak design, the confinement magnets are normally arranged outside a toroidal vacuum chamber holding the plasma. This chamber is known as the first wall, and defines the minimum distance between the magnets and plasma. In a production design, another layer, the blanket, sits between the first wall and magnets. The blanket serves two purposes, one is to protect the magnets from the high energy neutrons, which will damage them, and the other is to use those neutrons to breed tritium from lithium, producing more fuel for the reactor. However, this arrangement means there is considerable distance between the magnets and plasma, in most designs something on the order of a meter or more. This places significant limits on the achievable aspect ratio. One attempt to improve the reactor geometry was attempted by a class of designs known as the \\"compact tokamak\\", typified by the Alcator C-Mod (operational since 1991), the Riggatron (conceptual, unbuilt) and IGNITOR (construction in progress as of 2016-02). The later two of these designs dispensed with the first wall and placed the magnets in direct contact with the plasma; in a production design the blanket would be outside the magnets. This greatly simplifies the physical design as well, as the toroidal vacuum vessel can be replaced with a cylinder. The decreased distance between the magnets and plasma leads to much higher betas, so conventional (non- superconducting) magnets could be used.D.L. Jasby, \\"Selection of a toroidal fusion reactor concept for a magnetic fusion production reactor\\", Journal of Fusion Energy, Volume 6 Number 1 (1987), pg. 65 The downside to this approach, one that was widely criticized in the field, is that it places the magnets directly in the high-energy neutron flux of the fusion reactions. In operation the magnets would be rapidly eroded, requiring the vacuum vessel to be opened and the entire magnet assembly replaced after a month or so of operation.\\"Evaluation of Riggatron Concept\\" , Office of Naval Research Around the same time, several advances in plasma physics were making their way through the fusion community. Of particular importance were the concepts of elongation and triangularity, referring to the cross-sectional shape of the plasma. Early tokamaks had all used circular cross-sections simply because that was the easiest to model and build, but over time it became clear that C or (more commonly) D-shaped plasma cross-sections led to higher performance. This produces plasmas with high \\"shear\\", which distributed and broke up turbulent eddies in the plasma. These changes led to the \\"advanced tokamak\\" designs, which include ITER.Charles Kessel, \\"What's an Advanced Tokamak\\", Spring APS, Philadelphia, 2003 =Spherical tokamaks= In 1984,Y-K Martin Peng, \\"Spherical Torus, Compact Fusion at Low Yield\\"., ORNL/FEDC-87/7 (December 1984) Martin Peng of ORNL proposed an alternate arrangement of the magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing through the hole in the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2.Sykes 1997, pg. B247Braams and Scott, pg. 225 This means that STs can reach the same operational triple product numbers as conventional designs using one tenth the magnetic field. The design, naturally, also included the advances in plasma shaping that were being studied concurrently. Like all modern designs, the ST uses a D-shaped plasma cross section. If you consider a D on the right side and a reversed D on the left, as the two approach each other (as A is reduced) eventually the vertical surfaces touch and the resulting shape is a circle. In 3D, the outer surface is roughly spherical. They named this layout the \\"spherical tokamak\\", or ST. These studies suggested that the ST layout would include all the qualities of the advanced tokamak, the compact tokamak, would strongly suppress several forms of turbulence, reach high Œ≤, have high self- magnetism and be less costly to build.Y-K Martin Peng, \\"Compact DT Fusion Spherical Tori at Modest Fields\\", CONF-850610-37 (December 1985) The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. In 1985 ORNL proposed the Spherical Torus Experiment (STX). However, this was during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop and test a prototype central solenoid column built with 6 layers of turns of a high-strength copper alloy called \\"Glidcop\\" (each layer with water cooling).T.J. McManamy et al., \\"STX Magnet Fabrication and Testing to 18T\\", Martin Marietta Energy Systems, December 1988 However, they were unable to secure funding to build the complete STX design.Sykes 2008, pg. 11 =From spheromak to ST= Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a test machine built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the ST layout. Spheromaks are essentially \\"smoke rings\\" of plasma that are internally self-stable. Typical reactors use gas puffers and magnets to form the spheromak and inject it into a cylindrical confinement area, but as the magnetic fields are confined within the plasma, they are free to drift about the confinement area and collide with the first wall. The typical solution to this problem was to wrap the area in a sheet of copper, or more rarely, place a copper conductor down the center. When the spheromak approaches the conductor, a magnetic field is generated that pushes it away again. A number of experimental spheromak machines were built in the 1970s and early 80s, but demonstrated performance that simply was not interesting enough to suggest further development. Spheromaks with the central conductor had a strong mechanical resemblance to the ST design, and could be converted with relative ease. The first such conversion was made to the Heidelberg Spheromak ExperimentBruhns, H., Brendel, R., Raupp, G. and Steiger, J. \\"Study of the low aspect ratio limit tokamak in the Heidelberg spheromak experiment\\", Nuclear Fusion, Volume 27, Number 12, 2178 or HSE. Built at Heidelberg University in the early 1980s, HSE was quickly converted to a ST in 1987 by adjusting its magnetic coils at the outside of the confinement area and attaching them to a new central conductor. Although the new configuration only operated \\"cold\\", far below fusion temperatures, the results were promising and demonstrated all of the basic features of the ST. Several other groups with spheromak machines made similar conversions, notably the rotamak at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the SPHEX machine.Sykes 1998, pg. 1 In general they all found an increase in performance of a factor of two or more. This was an enormous advance, and the need for a purpose-built machine became pressing. =START and newer systems= Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of Derek Robinson, of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) fusion center at Culham.\\"Derek Robinson: Physicist devoted to creating a safe form of energy from fusion\\" The Sunday Times, 11 December 2002 What is today known as the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy was set up in the 1960s to gather together all of the UK's fusion research, formerly spread across several sites, and Robinson had recently been promoted to running several projects at the site. Robinson was able to gather together a team and secure funding on the order of 100,000 pounds to build an experimental machine, the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak, or START Alan Sykes et al., \\"First results from the START experiment\\", Nuclear Fusion, Volume 32 Number 4 (1992), pg. 694. Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV neutral beam injector from ORNL.Sykes 1997, pg. B248 Before it started operation there was considerable uncertainty about its performance, and predictions that the project would be shut down if confinement proved to be similar to spheromaks. Construction of START began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991. Its earliest operations quickly put any theoretical concerns to rest. Using ohmic heating alone, START demonstrated betas as high as 12%, almost matching the record of 12.6% on the DIII-D machine.Sykes 2008, pg. 29 The results were so good that an additional 10 million pounds of funding was provided over time, leading to a major re-build in 1995. When neutral beam heating was turned on, beta jumped to 40%, beating any conventional design by 3 times. Additionally, START demonstrated excellent plasma stability. A practical rule of thumb in conventional designs is that as the operational beta approaches a certain value normalized for the machine size, ballooning instability destabilizes the plasma. This so-called \\"Troyon limit\\" is normally 4, and generally limited to about 3.5 in real world machines. START improved this dramatically to 6. The limit depends on size of the machine, and indicates that machines will have to be built of at least a certain size if they wish to reach some performance goal. With START's much higher scaling, the same limits would be reached with a smaller machine.Sykes 1998, pg. 4 =Rush to build STs= Inside the National Spherical Torus Experiment vacuum chamber. START proved Peng and Strickler's predictions; the ST had performance an order of magnitude better than conventional designs, and cost much less to build as well. In terms of overall economics, the ST was an enormous step forward. Moreover, the ST was a new approach, and a low-cost one. It was one of the few areas of mainline fusion research where real contributions could be made on small budgets. This sparked off a series of ST developments around the world. In particular, the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) and Pegasus experiments in the US, Globus-M in Russia, and the UK's follow-on to START, MAST. In the meanwhile START itself found new life as part of the revolutionary Proto-Sphera project in Italy, where experimenters are attempting to eliminate the central column by passing the current through a secondary plasma.Sykes 2008, pg. 18The PROTO-SPHERA experiment, an innovative confinement scheme for Fusion. Franco Alladio, Instituto Nazionale de Fisica Nucleare. Italy. 14 September 2017. The Proto- Sphera project also removes the need of a divertor, since plasma instabilities are exploited rather than avoided.‚ÄúIn common reactors, attempts are made to prevent instabilities from forming, because these can cause the plasma to escape from the path established by the magnetic field and damage the internal walls of the reactor. To limit this, the surface of the plasma toroid is normally modeled so that the instabilities are concentrated towards an area that can be freely damaged, called divertor. In Proto-Sphera instabilities are exploited instead: by making the column unstable, this collapses into a spherical toroid, exploiting the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection: a phenomenon that takes place in the plasma and in which the magnetic energy of the plasma is converted into kinetic energy of the plasma itself.‚Äù Design Design of the ST40 spherical tokamak with a major radius of 0.4 m. Tokamak reactors consist of a toroidal vacuum tube surrounded by a series of magnets. One set of magnets is logically wired in a series of rings around the outside of the tube, but are physically connected through a common conductor in the center. The central column is also normally used to house the solenoid that forms the inductive loop for the ohmic heating system (and pinch current). The canonical example of the design can be seen in the small tabletop ST device made at Flinders University,See images in Sykes 2008, pg. 20 which uses a central column made of copper wire wound into a solenoid, return bars for the toroidal field made of vertical copper wires, and a metal ring connecting the two and providing mechanical support to the structure. =Stability within the ST= Advances in plasma physics in the 1970s and 80s led to a much stronger understanding of stability issues, and this developed into a series of \\"scaling laws\\" that can be used to quickly determine rough operational numbers across a wide variety of systems. In particular, Troyon's work on the critical beta of a reactor design is considered one of the great advances in modern plasma physics. Troyon's work provides a beta limit where operational reactors will start to see significant instabilities, and demonstrates how this limit scales with size, layout, magnetic field and current in the plasma. However, Troyon's work did not consider extreme aspect ratios, work that was later carried out by a group at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.Freidberg, pg. 414 This starts with a development of a useful beta for a highly asymmetric volume: : \\\\beta=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0}p}{\\\\langle B^2\\\\rangle}. Where \\\\langle B^2\\\\rangle is the volume averaged magnetic field \\\\scriptstyle\\\\langle B^2\\\\rangle = \\\\langle B_{\\\\theta}^2 + B_{\\\\rho}^2\\\\rangle (as opposed to Troyon's use of the field in the vacuum outside the plasma, \\\\scriptstyle B_0). Following Freidberg,Freidberg, pg. 413 this beta is then fed into a modified version of the safety factor: : q_\\\\star= \\\\frac{2\\\\pi B_0 a^2}{\\\\mu_0 R_0 I} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1+\\\\kappa^2}{2} \\\\right). Where \\\\scriptstyle B_0 is the vacuum magnetic field, a is the minor radius, \\\\scriptstyle R the major radius, \\\\scriptstyle I the plasma current, and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\kappa the elongation. In this definition it should be clear that decreasing aspect ratio, \\\\scriptstyle R/a, leads to higher average safety factors. These definitions allowed the Princeton group to develop a more flexible version of Troyon's critical beta: : \\\\beta_\\\\text{crit} = 5\\\\langle B_N\\\\rangle \\\\left( \\\\frac{1+\\\\kappa^2}{2}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{q_\\\\star}. Where \\\\epsilon is the inverse aspect ratio 1/A and \\\\langle B_N\\\\rangle is a constant scaling factor that is about 0.03 for any q_\\\\star greater than 2. Note that the critical beta scales with aspect ratio, although not directly, because q_\\\\star also includes aspect ratio factors. Numerically, it can be shown that \\\\beta_\\\\text{crit} is maximized for: : q_\\\\star = 1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\right)^{4/5} \\\\approx 1.8. Using this in the critical beta formula above: : \\\\beta_\\\\text{max} = 0.072 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1+\\\\kappa^2}{2}\\\\right)\\\\epsilon. For a spherical tokamak with an elongation \\\\kappa of 2 and an aspect ratio of 1.25: : \\\\beta_\\\\text{max} = 0.072 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1+2^2}{2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{1.25} = 0.14. Now compare this to a traditional tokamak with the same elongation and a major radius of 5 meters and minor radius of 2 meters: : \\\\beta_\\\\text{max} = 0.072 \\\\left(\\\\frac{1+2^2}{2}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{5/2} = 0.072. The linearity of \\\\beta_\\\\text{max}\\\\, with aspect ratio is evident. =Power scaling= Beta is an important measure of performance, but in the case of a reactor designed to produce electricity, there are other practical issues that have to be considered. Among these is the power density, which offers an estimate of the size of the machine needed for a given power output. This is, in turn, a function of the plasma pressure, which is in turn a function of beta. At first glance it might seem that the ST's higher betas would naturally lead to higher allowable pressures, and thus higher power density. However, this is only true if the magnetic field remains the same ‚Äì beta is the ratio of magnetic to plasma density. If one imagines a toroidal confinement area wrapped with ring- shaped magnets, it is clear that the magnetic field is greater on the inside radius than the outside - this is the basic stability problem that the tokamak's electric current addresses. However, the difference in that field is a function of aspect ratio; an infinitely large toroid would approximate a straight solenoid, while an ST maximizes the difference in field strength. Moreover, as there are certain aspects of reactor design that are fixed in size, the aspect ratio might be forced into certain configurations. For instance, production reactors would use a thick \\"blanket\\" containing lithium around the reactor core in order to capture the high-energy neutrons being released, both to protect the rest of the reactor mass from these neutrons as well as produce tritium for fuel. The size of the blanket is a function of the neutron's energy, which is 14 MeV in the D-T reaction regardless of the reactor design, Thus the blanket would be the same for a ST or traditional design, about a meter across. In this case further consideration of the overall magnetic field is needed when considering the betas. Working inward through the reactor volume toward the inner surface of the plasma we would encounter the blanket, \\"first wall\\" and several empty spaces. As we move away from the magnet, the field reduces in a roughly linear fashion. If we consider these reactor components as a group, we can calculate the magnetic field that remains on the far side of the blanket, at the inner face of the plasma: : B_{0}= ({1 - \\\\epsilon_B - \\\\epsilon}) {B_\\\\text{max}}.\\\\, Now we consider the average plasma pressure that can be generated with this magnetic field. Following Freidberg:Freidberg, pg. 413 : {\\\\langle p \\\\rangle} = \\\\beta_\\\\text{max}\\\\left (1 + \\\\kappa^2\\\\right) \\\\epsilon \\\\left({1 - \\\\epsilon_B - \\\\epsilon}\\\\right)^2 G(\\\\epsilon) \\\\left(B_\\\\text{max}\\\\right)^2. In an ST, where we are attempting to maximize B_0 as a general principle, one can eliminate the blanket on the inside face and leave the central column open to the neutrons. In this case, \\\\epsilon_0 is zero. Considering a central column made of copper, we can fix the maximum field generated in the coil, B_\\\\text{max} to about 7.5 T. Using the ideal numbers from the section above: :{\\\\langle p \\\\rangle} = 0.14 \\\\left(1 + 2^2\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1.25}\\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{1.25}\\\\right)^2 2.5 \\\\cdot 7.5^2 = 2.6 \\\\text{ atmospheres}. Now consider the conventional design as above, using superconducting magnets with a B_\\\\text{max} of 15 T, and a blanket of 1.2 meters thickness. First we calculate \\\\epsilon to be 1/(5/2) = 0.4 and \\\\epsilon_b to be 1.5/5 = 0.24, then: :{\\\\langle p \\\\rangle} = 0.072 \\\\left(1 + 2^2\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{0.4}\\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{0.24} - \\\\frac{1}{0.4}\\\\right)^2 1.2 \\\\cdot 15^2 = 7.7 \\\\text{ atmospheres}. So in spite of the higher beta in the ST, the overall power density is lower, largely due to the use of superconducting magnets in the traditional design. This issue has led to considerable work to see if these scaling laws hold for the ST, and efforts to increase the allowable field strength through a variety of methods. Work on START suggests that the scaling factors are much higher in STs, but this work needs to be replicated at higher powers to better understand the scaling. =Advantages= STs have two major advantages over conventional designs. The first is practical. Using the ST layout places the toroidal magnets much closer to the plasma, on average. This greatly reduces the amount of energy needed to power the magnets in order to reach any particular level of magnetic field within the plasma. Smaller magnets cost less, reducing the cost of the reactor. The gains are so great that superconducting magnets may not be required, leading to even greater cost reductions. START placed the secondary magnets inside the vacuum chamber, but in modern machines these have been moved outside and can be superconducting.See examples, Sykes 2008, pg. 13 The other advantages have to do with the stability of the plasma. Since the earliest days of fusion research, the problem in making a useful system has been a number of plasma instabilities that only appeared as the operating conditions moved ever closer to useful ones for fusion power. In 1954 Edward Teller hosted a meeting exploring some of these issues, and noted that he felt plasmas would be inherently more stable if they were following convex lines of magnetic force, rather than concave.Robin Herman, \\"Fusion: The Search for Endless Energy\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, pg. 30 It was not clear at the time if this manifested itself in the real world, but over time the wisdom of these words become apparent. In the tokamak, stellarator and most pinch devices, the plasma is forced to follow helical magnetic lines. This alternately moves the plasma from the outside of the confinement area to the inside. While on the outside, the particles are being pushed inward, following a concave line. As they move to the inside they are being pushed outward, following a convex line. Thus, following Teller's reasoning, the plasma is inherently more stable on the inside section of the reactor. In practice the actual limits are suggested by the \\"safety factor\\", q, which vary over the volume of the plasma. In a traditional circular cross-section tokamak, the plasma spends about the same time on the inside and the outside of the torus; slightly less on the inside because of the shorter radius. In the advanced tokamak with a D-shaped plasma, the inside surface of the plasma is significantly enlarged and the particles spend more time there. However, in a normal high-A design, q varies only slightly as the particle moves about, as the relative distance from inside the outside is small compared to the radius of the machine as a whole (the definition of aspect ratio). In an ST machine, the variance from \\"inside\\" to \\"outside\\" is much larger in relative terms, and the particles spend much more of their time on the \\"inside\\". This leads to greatly improved stability.Sykes 2008, pg. 24 It is possible to build a traditional tokamak that operates at higher betas, through the use of more powerful magnets. To do this, the current in the plasma must be increased in order to generate the toroidal magnetic field of the right magnitude. This drives the plasma ever closer to the Troyon limits where instabilities set in. The ST design, through its mechanical arrangement, has much better q and thus allows for much more magnetic power before the instabilities appear. Conventional designs hit the Troyon limit around 3.5, whereas START demonstrated operation at 6. =Disadvantages= The ST has three distinct disadvantages compared to \\"conventional\\" advanced tokamaks with higher aspect ratios. The first issue is that the overall pressure of the plasma in an ST is lower than conventional designs, in spite of higher beta. This is due to the limits of the magnetic field on the inside of the plasma, B_\\\\text{max}. This limit is theoretically the same in the ST and conventional designs, but as the ST has a much lower aspect ratio, the effective field changes more dramatically over the plasma volume. The second issue is both an advantage and disadvantage. The ST is so small, at least in the center, that there is little or no room for superconducting magnets. This is not a deal-breaker for the design, as the field from conventional copper wound magnets is enough for the ST design. However, this means that power dissipation in the central column will be considerable. Engineering studies suggest that the maximum field possible will be about 7.5 T, much lower than is possible with a conventional layout. This places a further limit on the allowable plasma pressures. However, the lack of superconducting magnets greatly lowers the price of the system, potentially offsetting this issue economically. The lack of shielding also means the magnet is directly exposed to the interior of the reactor. It is subject to the full heating flux of the plasma, and the neutrons generated by the fusion reactions. In practice, this means that the column would have to be replaced fairly often, likely on the order of a year, greatly affecting the availability of the reactor. In production settings, the availability is directly related to the cost of electrical production. Experiments are underway to see if the conductor can be replaced by a z-pinch plasmaPaolo Micozzi et all, \\"Ideal MHD stability limits of the PROTO-SPHERA configuration\\", Nuclear Fusion, Volume 50 Number 9 (September 2010) or liquid metal conductorYican Wu et all, \\"Conceptual study on liquid metal center conductor post in spherical tokamak reactors\\", Fusion Engineering and Design, Volumes 51-52 (November 2000), pg. 395-399 in its place. Finally, the highly asymmetrical plasma cross sections and tightly wound magnetic fields require very high toroidal currents to maintain them. Normally this would require large amounts of secondary heating systems, like neutral beam injection. These are energetically expensive, so the ST design relies on high bootstrap currents for economical operation.Freidberg, pg. 412 Luckily, high elongation and triangularity are the features that give rise to these currents, so it is possible that the ST will actually be more economical in this regard.
