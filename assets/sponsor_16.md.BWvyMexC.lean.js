Planned in 1954 and completed in 1957, the complex was designed in the modernist Post-war International style by architects, Bates, Smart & McCutcheon. Its completion marked the appearance of the first high-rise office block in North Sydney and the first use of curtain wall design. Built to provide much-needed office space for the Mutual Life & Citizens Assurance Company Limited, the building continues to be primarily-occupied by its original tenants. History By the early 1950s, the Mutual Life & Citizens Assurance Company Limited (MLC) had recognised that their existing 1938 headquarters on Martin Place was insufficient to their needs, at the same time as the company underwent a vast building programme, and in 1954 announced a new office for North Sydney. On the occasion of MLC's acquisition of a site in the North Sydney central business district for a new office complex, the General Manager of MLC, Milton Cromwell Alder, noted the future division of MLC offices in Sydney as a result: \\"the [current] position in the city [on Martin Place] is becoming intolerable because of traffic congestion, as well as the need to accommodate an expanding staff. The new building will become the head office, and will house most of the clerks. Most administrative and records work will be done there. The present building [on Martin Place] will be retained for executive headquarters and for dealing direct with the public.\\" MLC commissioned their preferred architects, Bates, Smart & McCutcheon, who had also designed their 1938 head office and with whom MLC would collaborate on the majority of their new office expansion programme, designing buildings in Brisbane (1955), Wollongong (1956), Shepparton (1959), Ballarat (1954), Geelong (1953), Adelaide (1957), Perth (1957), Newcastle (1957) North Sydney (1957), and Canberra (1959). The North Sydney MLC Building design, a 59 metre-high tower complex in the Post-war International style, was the result, with noted inspiration coming from Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's 1952 Lever House in New York and coming at the same time as the firm's design of ICI House in Melbourne. It was noted on the approval of the design that the MLC Building, through its design and height, marked the change of North Sydney as a second centre of metropolitan Sydney, with the Mayor of North Sydney, William Henry Brothers, commenting that \\"The northern side of the harbour will eventually develop into the commercial centre of Sydney\\". The modernist design itself was significant, with its first use of curtain wall design, the first use of modular units in Australia and was the first high-rise building in Australia to have a public plaza. As a mark of its position as the tallest building in North Sydney, a weather beacon was installed on the roof by Standard Telephones and Cables. Construction work was stopped temporarily in February 1957 when an electrician fell to his death from the 14th floor. His fellow workers later presented his widow and children with a cheque for A¬£1,200. Completed at a final cost of A¬£4.5 million the MLC Building was officially opened by Prime Minister Robert Menzies on 22 August 1957, who expressed that \\"The view [from the top floor] gives me such a new conception of Sydney that quite frankly I'm beginning to like the place\\". In 2000, the facade was restored by Bates Smart (as it was known from 1995) following a conservation management plan prepared by Peter McKenzie alongside extensive interior renovations for a project termed \\"Campsus MLC\\" by Bligh Voller Nield (James Grose, project architect). Features The building is a modernist, fourteen-storey (two below-ground) cubiform office block of of floorspace constructed on a rigid steel frame with hollow steel floors. Curtain walls of glass and anodized aluminium spandrels, with facing materials of terracotta, marble, granite and mosaic tiles. The MLC Building was Australia's largest office building on completion with over of office space and was also the largest steel structure in the Southern Hemisphere. Conservation The MLC Building is listed as an item on the North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013 as \\"The first high rise office block in North Sydney and the largest for a number of years after its construction. Seminal building on subsequent high- rise design in Sydney and utilised construction and structural techniques not previously used in Australia.\\" It is also on the Australian Institute of Architects' register of Nationally Significant 20th-Century Architecture and the heritage register of the National Trust of Australia (NSW).

The department was reorganized many times, and almost abolished on several occasions. In its early days, the department was frequently merged with, or proposed to be part of the Adjutant General. It expanded greatly after the American Civil War, to the point that it had around 2,000 officers in 1993. The current holder of the position is Leslie C. Smith.  History  The Office of the Inspector General of the United States Army dates back to the appointment of Augustin de la Balme (IG July 8, 1777October 11, 1777) as \\"inspector-general of the cavalry of the United States of America\\" and Philippe-Charles-Jean-Baptiste-Tronson Du Coudray (IG August 11, 1777September 15, 1777) as \\"Inspector General of Ordnance and Military Stores\\" during the American Revolutionary War. The first inspector general was Thomas Conway (IG December 13, 1777April 28, 1778). Next, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (IG May 5, 1778April 15, 1784) was selected by Washington. The position continued, variously merged with, commanding or being commanded by the Adjutant General of the United States Army until after the American Civil War, when it was formally established as an office equivalent to other Army departments. After the war, the inspectorate continued to largely grow. It was criticized for performance during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but the role of the office soon increased significantly, to the point that anything affecting the army's efficiency was within its scope. Upon the outbreak of World War I, the department grew dramatically, shrinking during the Great Depression, and further growing throughout World War II and the Cold War.  Current role  The Inspector General of the United States Army reports to the United States Secretary of the Army (SA) and the Chief of Staff of the United States Army (CSA). The IG investigates and reports on the \\"discipline, efficiency, economy, morale, training, and readiness\\" of the army, and acts as the \\"eyes, ears, voice, and conscience\\" of the SA and CSA. The inspectorate is authorized to undertake any investigations where they see necessary, and cooperates with the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense. The inspector is also responsible for inspecting various issues in the army including alleged problems within the army. The OTIG is composed of officers, non- commissioned officers, and DA civilians. It has a field operating agency, the United States Army Inspector General Agency, which comprises operational and support divisions. Any inspector is required to take the Inspector General oath: The Inspection Division has inspected or reviewed soldier readiness programs, risk management programs, anti-terrorism and force protection, extremist group activities, homosexual conduct policy implementation, and the No Gun Ri massacre during the Korean War.

Founded in 1760, the department has trained some of the world's most renowned and internationally recognized scholars of mathematics. Notable individuals affiliated with the department include John Nash, former faculty member and winner of the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences; Alan Turing, who received his doctorate from the department; and Albert Einstein who frequently gave lectures at Princeton and had an office in the building. Since 2012, the chair of the department has been David Gabai, who was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 2004 and was elected into the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2011. History The first courses in mathematics were offered in 1760 when undergraduates enrolled in classes such as algebra, trigonometry, geometry, and conic sections. Walter Minto was one of the earliest teachers of mathematics beginning in 1787. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the department became \\"one of the world's great centers of mathematical teaching and research.\\" President Woodrow Wilson appointed Henry Burchard Fine as dean of the faculty in 1903 and later as the first chairman of the Department of Mathematics in 1905. The university invited a number of leading mathematics to conduct research at Princeton including Luther P. Eisenhart, Solomon Lefschetz, James W. Alexander II, James Jeans, J.H.M. Wedderburn, George David Birkhoff, Oswald Veblen. In 1928, Princeton created the first research professorship in mathematics in the United States. Research in the field of mathematics also continued to thrive when the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) was founded in Princeton, New Jersey in 1930. Although the IAS and Princeton remain separate, they have continued to maintain close relations and collaborative projects thanks to their proximity to one another. Students and faculty are able to collaborate with IAS members and attend IAS seminar series. The political situation in Europe also caused an increased number of immigrants to enter the United States beginning in the 1930s. These scholars included Ralph Fox, Norman Steenrod, Emil Artin, John Tukey, Valentine Bargmann, Arthur Wightman, William Feller, and Donald C. Spencer. Others worked with both the then School of Mathematics and the Institute for Advanced Study to immigrate to the United States, including Albert Einstein, Hermann Weyl, Oskar Morgenstern, John von Neumann, Eugene Wigner, and Paul Erd≈ës. Albert Einstein, although never holding a position at the university, delivered a series of lectures on his theory of relativity in 1921 and continued to hold an office within the Department of Mathematics' building, Fine Hall, named in honor of the first faculty teacher and Princeton's first dean of science, Henry Burchard Fine. The fireplace in the professors' lounge was surmounted by a famous Einstein quote: \\"God does not play dice with the universe.\\" In 1968, the department moved to a new Fine Hall (the old building being renamed Jones Hall). The new building features three stories of classrooms and graduate student offices. Another ten floors contain faculty offices, a seminar room, and a professors' lounge. Fine Hall has been described as the \\"anchor of mathematics\\" as it was the home of the School of Mathematics. It was then that closer collaboration between the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University strengthened. Fine Hall also connects to Jadwin Hall, which is home to additional classroom and academic facilities. The architects of Fine and Jadwin Hall won the Award of Merit in the Architectural Design Award Program in 1966. Research =Albert Einstein Memorial Lecture= The Albert Einstein Memorial Lecture is held annually at Princeton on or around Einstein's birthday on March 14. The lecture is free and open to the public. The 24th Annual Albert Einstein Memorial Lecture was dedicated to \\"Scientific Inquiry and Growth\\". It featured Nobel Prize Winner Jack Szostak giving a presentation on \\"The Origin of Life\\". =Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics= The department runs the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM), an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental program for scholars interested in the application of mathematics to other fields. The PACM faculty consists of 15 core members, in addition to an executive committee, 34 graduate students, and 30 undergraduate certificate students. The PACM has been at the forefront of research within the field of high-energy physics, notably leading the NSF-funded Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP), a coalition of 17 research universities that develops computing software for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. =Annals of Mathematics= The department also co-publishes a bimonthly academic journal, the Annals of Mathematics, with the Institute for Advanced Study. Founded in 1884, the Annals is frequently recognized as one of the top journals in mathematics. =Women and Mathematics= The Women and Mathematics program is co-directed by the department and the IAS. The initiative aims to \\"recruit and retain more women in mathematics\\" through its lectures and mentorship program. Sun-Yung Alice Chang, the previous chairperson and first female chair, has taken a personal interest in attracting more women into the field. Academics =Awards and Medals= A number of individuals affiliated with the department have won international prizes for their research in mathematics, including the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, the Henri Poincar√© Prize, the Shaw Prize, Goldwater Scholars, and the Fulbright Award. =Undergraduate= At the undergraduate level, approximately 70‚Äì75 students concentrate in the field. Students complete required courses in real analysis, complex analysis, algebra, geometry, and topology. Like all A.B. candidates at Princeton, students are required to complete a senior thesis based on original and independent research. Students are also permitted to study abroad for a semester or an academic year at one of several internationally recognized institutions including the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Bonn University, the University of Moscow, and the University of Budapest. The department encourages those interested in pursuing careers to participate in the Principia: The Princeton Undergraduate Mathematics Journal. The journal was founded to promote and encourage research and exposition in mathematics at the undergraduate level. It was one of the first of its kind to be developed by undergraduates and has served as the model for academic journals at other universities. =Graduate= Ph.D. candidates in the department conduct independent research under supervision of a faculty member. After completing a series of introductory-level courses, graduate students specialize in at least two special or advanced topics within the discipline. Notably, students must demonstrate proficiency in one foreign language (French, German, or Russian), proving their ability to work with mathematical texts from scholars around the world. Graduate students are offered full tuition and student health plan coverage for all five years of the program. They are also able to apply for additional external funding and/or teach courses as Assistants-in-Instruction (AIs). =Rankings= In national and international rankings, the department often places within the top five of universities for the study of mathematics. U.S. News and World Report places the department at No. 1, ahead of Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University. Times Higher Education also places the department as No. 1, ahead of international universities such as the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, and ETH Zurich. Notable faculty The department is home to a number of scholars, researchers, and professors who have continued to be recognized by the international community. The university has been affiliated with 15 Fields Medalists, behind Harvard University (#1 with 18) and the University of Paris (#2 with 16).

Ioni»õƒÉ is known for his writing, especially poetry and poetry in translation, as well as for his cultural activity leading the Australian-Romanian Academy for Culture.  Early life  Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ was born in Bucharest, Romania on January 16, 1960. Ioni»õƒÉ's family left Romania in 1980, initially for Austria, before settling in New Zealand (from 1981 to 1988) and finally in Australia in 1989. He obtained a Bachelor's Degree with Honours in Psychology from Griffith University in Brisbane, graduating in 1997, and became a lecturer/senior presenter for Organisational Improvement & Excellence as part of the Lean Six SIgma Business Excellence Institute (LSSBEI.COM) and the Business Practice Unit of the University of Technology Sydney in 2005.  Writings  = Poetry collections - anthologies = Initially, and somewhat controversially, Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ became known for his bilingual (English/Romanian) anthology of Romanian poetry titled Testament ‚Äì Anthology of Modern Romanian Verse, published by Minerva Publishing House. The first edition (Bucharest 2012) covered 50 poets; the second edition (2015) expanded the scope of the anthology to 93 poets. These volumes span 160 years of Romanian poetry (from about 1850 to the present), translated to English with the assistance of English linguists and literature specialists Eva Foster, Daniel Reynaud, and Rochelle Bews. The anthology includes the best- known Romanian poets, as well as some emergent, less-recognised ones. An even larger edition, covering 120 poets, of Testament ‚Äì Anthology of Romanian Verse (having dropped the word ‚Äúmodern‚Äù from the title), presented only in English, was released in the United States in March 2017, with the support of the Australian Romanian Academy of Culture and the Romanian Cultural Institute, which organized its New York book launch. In 2018, together with Maria Tonu (Toronto, Canada), and with the support of Eva Foster, Daniel Reynaud, and Rochelle Bews, Ioni»õƒÉ also edited and translated the volume The Bessarabia of My Soul, which is a collection of poetry from the Republic of Moldova (MediaTon, 2018). Like Testament, this is a bilingual edition in English and Romanian, and represents some 40 Bessarabian poets starting with Alecu Russo and Alexei Mateevici, and including contemporaries like Grigore Vieru, Leonida Lari, Leo Butnaru and others. Also notable is the presence in this volume of poems by Mihai Eminescu, who is claimed as the national poet by both Romania and the Republic of Moldova. Both the volume and the event have been chronicled at length by Ion Cuzuioc in publications in the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Literary critic and historian Alex »òtefƒÉnescu wrote a review published in Literary Confluences describing the endeavour as a union between competence and good taste (no.2784 from 15 Aust 2018). = Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ's own poetry = Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ has also been published as a poet in his own right, publishing two bilingual volumes in English and Romanian, Hanging Between the Stars (Minerva Publishing House, 2013) and ContraDiction (Pim Publishing, 2016), as well as a Romanian-only volume Insula Cuvintelor de AcasƒÉ ‚Äì The Island of Words from Home (Limes Publishing, 2017). His poetry has been generally well-received by literary critics: Constantin Cuble»ôan wrote that it is ‚Äúdifficult to pigeonhole‚Ä¶ conversant across a number of styles‚Ä¶ a confronting lyrical tone‚Ä¶ a poet with no hang-ups, unlike many other contemporary ones‚Äù; »òtefan Ion Ghilimescu·¥Æ described it as having ‚Äúa trenchant manner, very direct linguistic approach and high expressivity‚Äù; and Lucian Vasilescu observed that, ‚Äúalthough he left Romania a long time ago, Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ [poetically] inhabits the Romanian language‚Äù. Reviewers have positively compared various parts of his work with both earlier poets like Tudor Arghezi or Geo Dumitrescu, as well as more recent poets such as Marin Sorescu. They have also commented on the deep irony and especially self-irony of some of the poems. Ghilimescu, particularly, considers this ironic tone as being somewhat defining of the poet. Cuble»ôan objects to some of Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ's more bawdy poems, but notes them as counterbalanced by the spiritually inspired ones. The spiritual poems were also regarded favourably by Ghilimescu, who suggested possible resonances from Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. Meanwhile, Alex »òtefƒÉnescu notes in his Postscript to the volume Hanging Between the Stars: ‚Äú‚Ä¶and now Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ publishes his own volume of verse, possessed by a pleasure of writing which is a rare commodity to the blas√© writers of today. In fact, this Romanian from Australia rediscovers poetry, employing picturesque words like Nichita Stanescu, or transforming metaphor as a means of discovering the world, like Blaga. He does all this without imitating anyone, rather reinventing lyrical performance ‚Äì with exuberance and freshness‚Äù. In 2016 and in 2018, Ioni»õƒÉ's poems were included into a biennial anthology series of contemporary Australian poetry, All These Presences and On first looking, published by Puncher & Wattmann from Sydney, Australia. This series, initiated by Dr. Carolyn Rickett of Avondale College of Tertiary Studies in New South Wales, Australia, blends the work of established poets (e.g. Jean Kent, Judith Beveridge, Martin Langford, David Musgrave, Judy Johnson, Christopher (Kit) Kelen, Linda Ireland, Stephen Edgar) with emergent talent. = Critical reactions to Testament ‚Äì Anthology of Romanian Verse = Testament - Anthology of Modern Romanian Verse (the title was changed to the more general Testament - Anthology of Romanian Verse by the time it reached the more recent American Edition) generated polarised reactions. The controversy arose mostly from the perspective of literary politics, regarding the choice of poets and poems and therefore how representative the anthology was of Romanian poetry. A fair number of critics were very positive, including Alex »òtefƒÉnescu (\\"Testament ‚Äì Anthology of Modern Romanian Verse represents the pantheon of Romanian poetry\\"... \\"no important Romanian poet is missing\\" and \\"I keep Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ's anthology on my desk [as reference]\\"), Lucian Vasilescu (‚ÄúThe work of the author of Testament is a rare one, if not unique even, thrilling and worthy of reverence‚Äù), Radu Voinescu (‚Äúone cannot contest the coherence of this volume‚Äù; ‚Äúafter the success of the first edition [Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ‚Äôs] anthology has all the hallmarks necessary to successfully represent Romanian culture to a level which we have all desired, for a very long time‚Äù); Florin Ionescu, referring to the second edition - ‚Äúthe current volume represents a true panorama of the poetic diversity of Romanian literature‚Äù·¥µ; finally Melania Cuc ‚Äì ‚ÄúThrough the clear and professional approach, with exceptional dexterity in the use and linkage of syntagma, the poet-translator Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ manages to bring to the light of print, and take to the world, an book of true value for us as a nation‚Äù The opposition to the anthology was equally vehement, and came from two sources. One was Corneliu Vadim Tudor, who wrote a blog article entitled ‚ÄúUgly book! Smacks to whoever wrote you!‚Äù. Vadim Tudor, a Romanian poet and politician, objected to the omission of poets such as Andrei Mure»ôanu (author of the verses to the Romanian National Anthem), Nichifor Crainic, and others. The second one is a similarly scathing article by Razvan Voncu, who also objects to the inclusion of certain poets over others - (‚ÄúA ridiculous anthology‚Äù). He objects to the absence of some poets such as Geo Dumitrescu, Dinu Flamand, and A.E.Baconski, as well as the presence of authors such as Nicolae Tzone or Adi Cusin. Voncu also criticises the chronological presentation of the poets in the volume. The quality of translation itself appears to be a secondary concern among these reviews, although Razvan Voncu asserts that ‚ÄúDaniel Ioni»õƒÉ is not a translator, never mind being a poet‚Äù. It is worth noting that, apart from Voncu's unsubstantiated claim, no Romanian literary critic/reviewer addressed in depth Testament's quality of the reinterpretation in English, or its approach to it. However one English speaking reviewer surmised that ‚Äú‚Ä¶[Testament] transfers well a voice which is distinctly Romanian into English, making it possible for the Romanian accent to be heard in our [English] language‚Ä¶ This volume represents a window into Romania‚Äôs soul.‚Äù In addition, two critics, Pavel Perfil and Alex »òtefƒÉnescu describe the book-launch of Testament in Australia - and single out specifically the recital by actor Tug Dumbly of a poem from it (Eminescu's ‚ÄúGlossa‚Äù) in the Parliament of New South Wales in Sydney on the occasion of Romania's national Day (1 December 2012) - as an exceptional opportunity to represent Romanian poetry at the antipodes. In his extensive critical review of Mihai Eminescu's work, »òtefƒÉnescu renders the whole of Eminescu's Gloss in the English version from Testament, as a demonstration to his readers that this technically difficult work can be successfully transferred into English. =Testament - 400 Years of Romanian Poetry (2019)= In November 2019, Minerva Publishing brought out the bilingual volume Testament - 400 Years of Romanian Poetry - 400 de ani de poezie rom√¢neascƒÉ, Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ being again the editor and principal translator, assisted this time by Daniel Reynaud, Adriana Paul and Eva Foster. This book, occupying 1152 pages, covers the whole spectrum of published Romanian poetry, from early anonymous poetry (The \\"Miori»õa\\" ballad and others), the \\"Metropolitan Dosoftei\\" (17th century), together many other poets before the classical era. The volume is also more comprehensive in the representation of both classical and contemporary poetry, representing the work of about 350 poets. In addition, and different to previous editions, this volume includes critical-biographical notes for every poet included. The preface is by literary critic and historian Alex »òtefƒÉnescu, while Australian poet and editor Martin Langford, director of Australian Poetry Inc. has written the postscript. For this volume, Ioni»õƒÉ was awarded the \\"Antoaneta Ralian\\" Prize for Translation from Romanian into a foreign language - of the Gaudeamus Book Fair - Bucharest 2019. Cultural influence Perhaps because of these differing views, Ioni»õƒÉ has received a considerable amount of exposure in the media, with various television channels (TVR, SperantaTV, TVR International, TVR Transilvania, Cotidianul TV, Na»ôul-TV among others) and radio stations (Radio Romania ActualitƒÉ»õi, SmartFM in Romania, the ABC and SBS stations in Australia, ARCA TV from the US) broadcasting about his work, and interviewing on a regular basis when he visits Romania. This exposure increased especially after the formation, in 2014, of the Australian-Romanian Academy for Culture, a body promoting specific cultural cooperation projects involving artists, writers and academics from Australia and Romania. Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ's work has also been translated into other media: singers-songwriters Catalin Condurache, Sandy Deac and Adrian Ivani»õchi have written and performed songs on some of Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ's more romantic poems.

Depending on the number of players, the number of cards may, however, be greater. The game is common in the German-speaking region among children and young people.  Playing  = Card game = Each player is dealt four cards, except the player to the right of the dealer who is dealt five and starts the game. The aim is to collect four cards of the same value (a so-called quartet) in one's hand (e. g. four Unters or Bauern). This is achieved by passing the \\"fifth\\" card each time to the player on the right. He takes the card and gives another card, or the passed card, to his right in turn. If a card does the complete circuit it is out of the game and a new card is drawn from the top of the talon. When a player achieves the aim by having four cards of equal rank in his hand, he places them face up in front of him and calls \\"Fingerkloppe!\\". The other players must immediately place their cards down likewise. Whoever is the last to do this has lost. In a two- hand game, the loser is the one who has not managed to collect four cards of a kind in his or her hand. = Penalties = After the card game follows the award of penalties to the loser. Two different penalty systems have established themselves: In the original case the loser names a card (e. g. Ace of Hearts or Ober of Leaves) and the winner searches through the shuffled talon from the top until the chosen card appears and picks up the entire stack down to that card. The loser is then rapped on the fingertips with that stack of cards. In the second case, the loser also names a card of his or her choice and also whether the talon is to be counted down from the top or up from the bottom. He then places one hand, palm downwards under the table. The winner now picks the top or bottom card at will. The suit of that card indicates what penalty the loser receives: * Hearts = the winner strokes the back of the loser's hand * Diamonds/Bells = the winner runs his knuckles firmly over the back of the loser's hand * Spades/Leaves = the winner punches the back of the loser's hand with his fist * Clubs/Acorns = the winner pinches the back of the loser's hand This continues until the named card appears. Then a new game starts.  Variations  * Each player, not just the winner, penalises the loser * Quartets of cards are removed from a pack corresponding to the number of players (for four players i.e. 16 cards). These cards are shuffled and dealt, the same number to each player. The game is then played as before, until someone has a set of four cards. * If the loser withdraws his hand when being punished, the entire stack is used as a penalty.

She ran a passenger-cargo service between Seattle, Washington, and the Pribilof Islands, and provided transportation between the two inhabited Pribilofs, Saint Paul Island and St. George Island. She also carried passengers, supplies, and provisions to destinations on the mainland of the Territory of Alaska and in the Aleutian Islands. She occasionally supported research activities in Alaskan waters and the North Pacific Ocean.  Construction and commissioning On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands to the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF).AFSC Historical Corner: The Pribilof Islands Tender Vessels Retrieved September 4, 2018 The United States Department of the Interior‚Ä≤s Fish and Wildlife Service ‚Äì renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) after a 1956 reorganization ‚Äì assumed these responsibilities when it replaced the Bureau of Fisheries in 1940. Since 1917, the Bureau of Fisheries had operated a \\"Pribilof tender,\\" a dedicated supply vessel used to transport passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilof Islands.

With the low bid of $89,589, the Ballard Marine Railroad Company of Seattle won the contract to construct her. The first attempt to launch the ship at Salmon Bay in Seattle on 7 January 1930 failed when, after she was christened with the traditional bottle of champagne broken across her bow, she did not move; the grease used on the launching skids had frozen and the ship remained stuck in place even after two boats in the bay attempted to pull her into the water. By 8 January 1930, the grease had thawed and, with a large and enthusiastic crowd looking on, the launching ceremony was repeated and the ship slid into Salmon Bay. After fitting out, the ship was commissioned into the BOF fleet in the spring of 1930 as MV Penguin. Service history =Bureau of Fisheries= Immediately following her commissioning, Penguin departed Seattle on 5 May 1930 to begin her first voyage to the Pribilof Islands, where she arrived on 16 May 1930, delivering 17 BOF employees and 175 tons of general cargo. In September 1930, she spent two weeks supporting salmon escapement studies in Southeast Alaska's Ketchikan District. By the end of 1930, after only eight months in commission, Penguin had logged over and had proven her capability to operate in extreme weather conditions that arrived late in the year. Commissioner of Fisheries Henry O'Malley ‚Äì the chief of the BOF ‚Äì and his party used Penguin for several weeks in July and August 1931 to inspect fisheries in various parts of the Territory of Alaska, and the BOF fishery patrol vessel substituted for Penguin as the BOF‚Ä≤s Pribilof tender during that period.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Crane, a Long History of Extensive Use In September 1932, Penguin transported three live fur seals and 19 live rosy finches from the Pribilof Islands to Seattle, from which the animals were shipped by train to the National Zoological Park in Washington D.C.; all but one male fur seal and three of the finches survived the trip. On 24 January 1933, the wooden Unangan Aleut trading boat Umnak Native was anchored in Inanudak Bay off Umnak in the Aleutian Islands when a violent storm struck, snapping her anchor chain, and she broke up and sank when her engine failed to start. Only four of the 15 people on board survived, including Bishop Antonin Pokrovsky of the Russian Orthodox Church. Local inhabitants on Umnak found Pokrovsky after he reached shore, but could not transport him, and the steamer Starr, although in the vicinity, lacked the charts necessary to enter the bay safely and pick him up. Pokrovsky was suffering from severe illness and frozen legs, so the BOF was asked to help, and it sent Penguin, which rescued Pokrovsky on 14 February 1933. MV Penguin rides at anchor in the Bering Sea off St. George Island in the Pribilof Islands in 1939 as a baidar, or \\"bidarrah,\\" transships her cargo to the island. The lack of docking facilities for Penguin in the Pribilofs necessitated this time-consuming method of unloading her.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center Multimedia Gallery Retrieved September 8, 2018 Penguin suffered two mishaps of her own later in 1933. On 8 August 1933, her steering gear broke while she was in Seymour Narrows in British Columbia's Discovery Passage; strong tidal currents in the narrows endangered her, but the halibut fishing boat Bernice was nearby and towed her to safety so she could make repairs. On 21 September, Penguin collided with the vessel Tuscan about southeast of Ketchikan, then towed the damaged Tuscan to Ketchikan; Tuscans owners later filed a claim for US$6,800 claim in damages against the BOF, but a trial six months later resulted in dismissal of the claim when Tuscans owners could not prove negligence on the part of Penguin. In 1934, Penguin transported United States Navy, United States Post Office, and Steamboat Inspection Service personnel to various destinations along the coast of the Territory of Alaska. In 1936, a fathometer was installed aboard Penguin which allowed her to navigate more safely in Alaskan waters and especially in the poorly charted waters of the Aleutian Islands. After the BOF established a field station on Amchitka in the western Aleutians in 1937 to expand the study and protection of sea otters, Penguin began making voyages to Amchitka to transport construction materials, construction workers, supplies, and cargo for the construction and maintenance of the station. A case of measles was discovered aboard Penguin while she was at Saint Paul Island in the Pribilofs on 1 July 1939, and she underwent a two-week quarantine. In 1940, Penguins crew assisted the staff at the Amchitka field station with electrical repairs, power plant servicing, and the installation of a radio-telephone transmitter and antennae. In addition to these activities, Penguin continued her regular schedule of voyages between Seattle and the Pribilof Islands, bringing passengers and provisions to the islands and transporting them between the two inhabited Pribilofs, Saint Paul Island and St. George Island. During the 1930s, the annual take of sealskins at the Pribilofs increased significantly, and by 1940 reached an annual total of 64,864, the most taken in 50 years. Fox pelts also were an important export from the Pribilofs; in the December 1938‚ÄìJanuary 1939 trapping season alone, 1,029 fox pelts were also taken on the islands. Byproducts from sealing operations produced at a plant on Saint Paul Island ‚Äì consisting in 1939 of nearly 28,000 US gallons (514 barrels; 105,592 liters) of seal blubber oil, 4,789 gallons of seal carcass oil; and 338,421 pounds of seal meal ‚Äì also were exported. Penguin and military vessels transported all these goods to Seattle. From there, the skins went by rail to St. Louis, Missouri, for processing and public auction by the Fouke Fur Company, while the BOF‚Ä≤s Division of Fish Culture acquired 75 tons of the seal meal for use as hatchery fish food across the United States and the rest of the seal meal was sold at auction. =Fish and Wildlife Service= In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the United States Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, Penguin became part of the fleet of the new FWS in 1940. MV Penguin in an undated photograph. As the threat of war with Japan grew, Penguin was transferred from the FWS to the U.S. Navy in 1941 for special duty, and she arrived at Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island in the Aleutian Islands in early 1942 to resume her voyages to the Pribilofs. During 1942, she transported supplies, provisions, and equipment to an internment camp at Funter Bay, Alaska, in preparation for the evacuation of the Aleut population from the Pribilof Islands to the camp. Between 1947 and 1949, Penguin conducted cruises involving the study of albatrosses that took her as far as the western tip of the Aleutian Island chain, across the North Pacific Ocean, and as far south as San Francisco, California. By 1948, she was logging an average of almost per year. On the night of 3 June 1950, Penguin was moored at the FWS dock in Lake Union at Seattle when a fire destroyed her superstructure and cabins. Her hull was saved, but the FWS concluded that the cost of repairs ‚Äì originally estimated at between US$15,000 and US$20,000, but later at US$75,000AFSC Historical Corner: Penguin II, Pribilof Islands Tender (1950‚Äì64) Retrieved September 6, 2018 ‚Äì was higher than the cost of purchasing a replacement vessel. With Penguin at the time of the fire scheduled to depart for the Pribilofs with much-needed supplies on 13 June 1950, her replacement was a matter of some urgency, so the FWS retired her from service and on 9 June 1950 purchased the United States Army coastal cargo ship Lt. Raymond Zussman and placed her in service as its new Pribilof tender immediately. Lt. Raymond Zussman departed Seattle for her first voyage to the Pribilofs on 17 June 1950, only four days later than Penguins scheduled departure. During the summer of 1950, United States Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman announced that Lt. Raymond Zussman would undergo a name change, saying, \\"The goodwill built up for 20 years in the name of the Penguin will not be lost...the vessel's successor has been named Penguin II.\\" Accordingly, the FWS formally renamed its new Pribilof tender in honor of Penguin on 21 September 1950. =Later career= The FWS sold the damaged Penguin at auction to Tom Farrell and Russ Gibson of Seattle for US$25,778 on 21 March 1951. Believing she could be repaired and returned to service, her designer, H. C. Hanson, obtained her and completely rebuilt her, also installing new wiring and equipment during her reconstruction. The H. O. Merren Company of the Cayman Islands bought Penguin in 1957, registered her under the British flag, renamed her Carib Queen, and based her at Georgetown in the Cayman Islands. H. O. Merren used her to transport tourists from Florida to H. O. Merren's resort in the Caymans.

She spent much of the time during the twelve Nazi years abroad or, later, in state detention. In 1945 she relocated to what now became the Soviet occupation zone (after October 1949 East Germany) where she became the first General Secretary of the politically important Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD).  Life  = Provenance and early years = Maria Rentmeister was born in Sterkrade (Oberhausen) in Germany's heavily industrialised Ruhr/Rhine region, the eldest of her parents' six children. Her father worked as a tailor. In political terms it was Katharina Rentmeister (1881-1952), the mother of the six Rentmeister children, who was probably the more important influence. She is also identified in sources by her soubriquet, \\"die rote K√§the\\" (\\"Red Kathy\\"). Right from the outbreak of the First World War she opposed it, a political standpoint which the political left in Germany shared with increasing passion as the war inflicted ever more carnage on the fighting men and ever greater destitution on those they had left at home. Nor did Red Kate miss an opportunity to share her political passions with her husband simply because he was away at the front. She used to send him stock market reports and financial statements in respect of the large industrial firms in the Ruhr regions. \\"That way you know what it is you are really fighting for: the 'Fatherland' is Krupp [a famously profitable armaments conglomerate]\\" (\\"Damit du wei√üt wof√ºr du f√§llst ... das Vaterland ist die Firma Krupp\\"\\"). K√§the Rentmeister was a member of the Social Democratic Party while her children were small, but in 1929 she would join the Communists. K√§the Rentmeister's six children could not avoid the effects growing up in an atmosphere of heightened political awareness. Maria's younger brother Hans also left a significant footprint on history an am anti-Nazi activist. = Politics = After successful conclusion of her school career, Maria Rentmeister underwent a commercial training. She joined the Young Socialists (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend\\"/ SAJ) in 1927. In 1929 she emigrated to the United States where, according to at least one widely requoted source, she remained for three years and worked as a \\"labourer\\" (als \\"Arbeiterin\\"). Elsewhere there are indications that her employment as a young woman may have been more clerical or secretarial than manual. Sources differ as to whether it was in 1930 or 1932 that Maria Rentmeister joined the Communist Party, but she was clearly a member before 1933. By the end of 1932 was heading up the women's section in the party's district leadership team (\\"Unterbezirksleitung\\") for Oberhausen, and was also a Communist town councillor. = Nazi years = The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. That made political activism on behalf of non-Nazi political parties illegal, and after the Reichstag fire it became obvious that political activism on behalf of the Communist Party was viewed with particularly savage disfavour by government agencies. Maria Rentmeister pursued her now illegal political activism for the Communist Party, but she did so in the Saarland (region) which for reasons of history and politics would not come under full German control till early 1935. In the Saarland she established a reputation with party comrades as a trainer and administrator. By 1935 the leadership of the German Communist Party had been arrested (or worse), or else had fled abroad. Two cities, in particular, were rapidly becoming the de facto head quarter locations for the German Communist Party in exile: Paris and Moscow. It was to Paris that Maria Rentmeister fled during the Autumn/Fall of 1934. There she worked during 1934/35 for the ambitiously named \\"World Committee against War and Fascism\\" (\\"Weltkomitee gegen Krieg und Faschismus\\"). This also involved taking over administrative responsibility for the World Committee's newspaper, \\"Weltfront\\" which was produced under the editorship of Albert Norden who many years later would become an influential senior journalist in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). More immediately, it was through Norden that Maria Rentmeister become involved with the party's \\"Weltfrauenkomitee\\" (\\"World Women's Committee\\"), for which she also worked. = Wilhelm Beuttel = One senior activist comrade who escaped to Paris during the Autumn/Fall of 1935 was Wilhelm Beuttel, who took on a position of responsibility for political \\"education\\" within the exiled party leadership. Maria Rentmeister and Wilhelm Beuttel teamed up and became partners. One source indicates that the two political exiles married at some stage, but most infer, that Beuttel and Rentmeister still had not taken this step when, in July 1944, Beuttel was executed at Cologne. = Party work from outside Germany = In 1936 Maria Rentmeister transferred from Paris to the Netherlands where the focus of her party work was on political \\"education\\". At the same time she worked with others for the German Communist Party leadership's \\"western division\\" (\\"KPD- Abschnittsleitung West\\") on the \\"Westdeutsche Kampfbl√§tter\\" (resistance newspaper), produced for (illegal) distribution among comrades living \\"underground\\" (unregistered at their town halls), across the frontier in Nazi Germany. There are also references to her having been involved in Amsterdam with the \\"Red Aid\\" international workers' welfare organisation. In 1937 the party sent her to Switzerland where she worked for the German Party leadership's \\"southern division\\"(\\"KPD-Abschnittsleitung S√ºd\\"). Her work, as before, involved political \\"education\\". One source also mentions collaboration with exiled German SPD activists, although this would at this time still have run counter to the policy of the powerfully influential Soviet Party Leadership over in Moscow. Wilhelm Beuttel was smuggled from Amsterdam to Z√ºrich at the same time as Rentmeister. At the end of 1937 he was sent back to Amsterdam, however. In or before early 1938 Maria Rentmeister was also sent back to Amsterdam by the party. From Amsterdam Rentmeister now took on responsibility for co-ordinating \\"Communist women's resistance\\" (\\"kommunistischen Frauenwiderstand\\") in western Germany. = Prison = The Netherlands had avoided full military involvement in the First World War, and Chancellor Hitler's guarantee of Dutch neutrality in November 1939 encouraged the already widespread belief that in this respect history might be about to repeat itself. However, the German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and very quickly took the country over. Maria Rentmeister was caught and arrested by the Gestapo soon afterwards. In 1941 the :de:Oberlandesgericht Hammregional high court at Hamm convicted her on the usual charge of \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). She was imprisoned till 1945 in the Anrath prison on the edge of Krefeld. = After the war = War ended, formally, in May 1945 and Maria Rentmeister was released. Her prison and her home region were now under military administration as part of the British occupation zone. Maria, along with most of her relatives, relocated to the large central portion of Germany which was being administered as the Soviet occupation zone, and would be relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Communist Party membership was no longer illegal, and she took a lead in re-establishing a party branch in Dessau, where work was starting on rebuilding the destroyed town, between May and July1945. She was soon able to move to Berlin, less than 100 km to the northeast, where during the Summer of 1945 she worked for the party on culture related matters. From 1945 till its dissolution in November 1947 she also served as chair of the Berlin party Women's Committee. A new political party was formed under contentious circumstances in April 1946 as a result of which Rentmeister was one of many thousand committed communists who signed their party memberships across to the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), which over the next few years would go on to become the ruling party in a different kind of German one-party dictatorship. She served between 1946 and 1950 as a member of the Party Executive, generally seen as the precursor to the powerful Party Central Committee which emerged, formally, in July 1950. She also served, between 1946 and 1948, as a member of the Berlin City Parliament (\\"Berliner Stadtverordnetenversammlung\\"). Most of the members of the postwar Party Executive went on to become Central Committee members following the launch of the German Democratic Rerpublic, but Maria Rentmeister did not. At a meeting of the Party Executive in Autumn 1948 it fell to Rentmeister to deliver an unwelcome message to party comrades, including the future leadership of the German Democratic Republic. Among the workers in the country, a mood of desolation prevailed (\\"... eine desolate Stimmung unter den Arbeitern\\" herrschte). More alarmingly still, the workers displayed strongly anti-Soviet attitudes (\\"... starke antisowjetische Einstellungen\\"). It was not something that those present were equipped to address effectively, but report of that speech does provide an early glimpse of the slow-burn build-up to the 1953 uprising. At the Second People's Congress, on 17/18 March 1948, she was elected for membership of the first German People's Council, mandated to draw up a new constitution (based on a document that had already been provided to it). She was also one of those selected, the next year, for membership of the second People's Council which replaced the first in May 1949 and went on to constitute itself, in October 1949, as the East German parliament (Volkskammer). At that point she did not remain as a Volkskammer member. Rentmeister's political career was very far from over, however. In 1947 Maria Renrtmeister was one of the founders of the Democratic Women's League (Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands/ DFD), serving as a member of its national executive. Between 1947 and 1949 she also served as its general secretary. The DFD was one of five mass organisations which, under the centralised Leninist government model being adopted, was designed to broaden the popular legitimacy of the overall political structure. Alongside the officially designated bloc parties, the mass organidations received from the ruling party their own fixed quotas of seats in the national parliament (Volkskammer). In 1949 Rentmeister took charge at the national Department for Cultural Enlightenment at the Ministry for Public Education. Here, till 1954, she was in charge of developing East German cultural relations with foreign countries. Between 1951 and 1954 she also took on the deputy chairmanship at the National Commission for Cultural Artifacts. Between 1954 and 1958 Rentmeister was the acting head of the National Arts Department within the Ministry for Culture. Between 1958 and 1960 she headed up the press and publicity activities of Progress Film, the country‚Äôs monopoly film distributor. In 1960, officially on health grounds, she retired from her professional career. After 1960 she worked as a volunteer for the Party Central Committee's Institute for Marxism-Leninism. She also involved herself with the Commission for the History of the Local Labour Movement which had been established by the Berlin party leadership team (\\"SED-Bezirksleitung Berlin\\").  Personal  Maria Rentmeister was married firstly to the Oberhausen communist Wilhelm Bettinger and secondly to Fritz Rettmann (1902-1981). Both were actively engaged in anti-Nazi resistance after 1933. Both spent time in prison and / or camps because of their resistance activities. Both nevertheless survived Nazi imprisonment. Aside from this, details, including the dates of the marriages, are not disclosed in sources. Maria Rentmeister also had a daughter.

Reinforced is one of the groundbreaking record labels of the genre.Reynolds, S. (1998) Energy Flash, Picador, p195-199, Early history Reinforced was started in 1989 by Mark \\"Marc Mac\\" Clair of 4hero and Gus Lawrence, soon to be joined by Dennis \\"Dego\\" McFarlane (also of 4hero) and Ian Bardouille. The first releases were all 4hero productions, including Mr Kirk's Nightmare which sold more than 24,000 copies and which truly launched the label. During the height of the rave scene in 1991 and 1992, as with labels such as Moving Shadow and Suburban Base, it was prolific in its output, releasing singles such as \\"The Head Hunter\\" and \\"Cooking Up Yah Brain\\" by 4hero, \\"Feel Real Good\\", \\"Oblivion (Head In The Clouds)\\" and \\"Rainbow People\\" by Manix (Marc Mac), \\"Kingdom of Dub\\" by Tek 9 (Dego), \\"Seance\\" as well as \\"Atheama\\" by Nebula II, and \\"A London Sumtin\\" by Code 071. Probably the most important connection to be made during this time, though, was that of Goldie, who had been introduced to them by his then girlfriend DJ Kemistry. He initially created some design and artwork for the label, and went on to do A&R.; He also gained some studio time, which resulted in a two track 12\\" single (with tracks \\"Krisp Biscuit\\" and \\"Killer Muffin\\") under the alias Rufige Cru, followed up shortly afterwards by a four track EP Darkrider. It was around this time, that Goldie also became obsessed with the use of metal acetates known as dubplates to test out new tracks before release. He created a skull label logo specifically for use on Reinforced dubplates, which would eventually become Metalheadz's logo. The Darkrider EP was amongst a number of releases at this time to explore the darkcore sound in late 1992/early 1993, alongside \\"Journey From The Light\\" by 4hero, \\"Here Comes The Drumz\\" by Nasty Habits (Doc Scott) and \\"Return of Nookie\\" by Nookie. This period saw Reinforced continually push at the boundaries of the music and incorporating techniques such as 'time- stretching' and 'pitch-shifting', and putting out a long-running series of picture disc EPs called the Enforcers which not only allowed for more experimental music to be put out alongside dancefloor-oriented tracks, but which became increasingly innovative in their design and artwork too. 2nd wave Into the second half of the 1990s, a new emerging roster of artists such as Sonar Circle, Alpha Omega, Paradox, and G-Force and Seiji (later to become part of the Bugz in the Attic production crew) were increasingly experimenting with ever chopped up drum patterns, which would eventually develop into the broken beat genre. The aforementioned artists, and a new generation of producers such as Sonic & Silver, Genotype, Syntax, and Breakage came through to launch what was known as the '2nd wave' into the 2000s. Today In recent years, Reinforced have largely been re-releasing back catalogue music, and putting out previously unreleased material and remixes of classic tracks.

Description and taxonomy The species was described in 2018 by zoologist Andrew Gray, and is named after his granddaughter. It can be distinguished from the closely related C. calcarifer (Splendid Tree Frog) by having small green lichen-like markings on its dorsal surfaces rather than white or pale blue spots and lacking characteristic dark ventral markings found on the thighs of C. calcarifer. The species is also easily identified by having a large external eardrum (tympanum), which is almost the same size as the eye, compared to an eardrum half its size, as seen in C. calcarifer. DNA analysis places C. sylviae genetically closer to its sister species, C. craspedopus, than to the true C. calcarifer described by George A. Boulenger in 1902. Distribution C. sylviae occurs from Panama to Honduras, where it lives in primary forest. The type locality for the species is Guayac√°n in Lim√≥n province of Costa Rica.

During the Siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s, the organization provided medical aid, food rations and educational services for the people trapped in the city. History The Jewish Community in Bosnia dates back to the 15th Century, when Sephardic Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition found refuge in the Ottoman-occupied Balkans. The Jewish community thrived in Bosnia, having good relations with the other religious groups in the area. The history of La Benevolencija, however begins in 1892, after the Austro-Hungarian Empire occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina. The occupation brought with it well-educated Ashkenazi Jews from other parts of the Empire. The original goal of La Benevolencija was to pool funds so that Bosnian Jewish students could attend better universities in other parts of the Empire. Because levels of anti-semitism were relatively lower in the Balkans than in other parts of the Empire, many students returned to Sarajevo after their university studies, which helped the long-term growth of the organization. The organization continued to encourage education, opening what would be the largest public library in Sarajevo. World War II decimated the Jewish community in Sarajevo and Bosnia as a whole. After the creation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1945, religious-based organizations like La Benevolencija were banned. Despite these bans, the community continued similar activities to that of La Benevolencija, however on a more secular scale. The fall of socialism provided an opportunity for the Jewish community in Bosnia to re-launch the organization. In 1991 La Benevolencija was re-formed, with a mission to \\"share and celebrate the richness and diversity of Bosnian-Jewish culture\\" with the rest of the community. 1992 brought with it both celebration and tragedy. The organization was able to celebrate its 100th anniversary, but regional conflicts were beginning to reach Bosnia. =During the War= Even before the conflict began in earnest in Bosnia, La Benevolencija prepared for the worst. Upon hearing that elderly patients in Dubrovnik were unable to access medication because of the War in Croatia, the organization began stockpiling medication and food with a long shelf-life. When shelling of the city began in May of 1992, many people in the city sought shelter in the city's synagogue as people were afraid and had nowhere else to go. The Jewish community in Bosnia was benefited by two different situations. First, they were able to use their neutral status to protect people from all the other ethnic groups in the city. Additionally, they benefited logistically. While many of the other humanitarian aid organizations had their supplies outside of the city and were unable to bring them past the siege, La Benevolencija used the gymnasium of the Synagogue to store supplies, thereby making it one of the few places where food and supplies could be found after all the stores had been looted. During the Siege, the organization had many roles. La Benevolencija opened three pharmacies in the city. A clinic was opened in the Jewish Community Center to treat the sick and injured. A non-denominational soup kitchen was organized, which provided 320 meals a day, 7 days a week. The organization provided educational and cultural programs for citizens trapped by the siege, teaching language courses, holding exhibitions for journalists at the Sarajevo Holiday Inn, and organizing the Miss Sarajevo pageant. When phone lines and postal service was cut, the organization set up a two-way radio link for people to keep in contact with the outside world, and worked with international journalists to receive and distribute letters. This was not merely a Jewish effort, however. People from across the community offered their support and expertise to the organization during the siege, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. As the siege dragged on, the organization worked with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee to allow convoys of civilians to escape the city and travel to peaceful territory. Jakob Finci, one of the leaders of La Benevolencija, helped forge the travel documents of Serbs, Croats and Muslims in the city so they would be listed as Jews on their travel documents and therefore escape the city safely. In the end, La Benevolencija helped over 2000 people escape Sarajevo during the Siege. La Benevolencija today After the war, the organization slowly ended its humanitarian work; closing down its pharmacies, ending the soup kitchen and shifting its education programs to job training programs. Working with the World Bank, the UNHCR and the US Government, the organization developed a microcredit program that offered loans up to 10000 Bosnian convertible marks to small businesses. As of 2012, this microcredit program had a 97% repayment rate. The Organization also provides home care services to the elderly in Bosnia. With the help of the JDC, the organization provides care for 100-400 people two to three times a week, operating not only in Sarajevo, but in \\"Mostar, Zenica, Doboj, Banja Luka and Tuzla\\". Radio La Benevolencija Humanitarian Tools Foundation In 2002, inspired by La Benevolencija, a group media professionals in the Netherlands founded the NGO Radio La Benevolencija Humanitarian Tools Foundation (RLB), an organisation producing the radio soap ', , as well as documentaries and educational programmes in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi for the empowerment of people who are the targets of hate violence.Labenevolencija.org: Organisation References External links * La Benevolencija - Jewish Community of Bosnia * Short Documentary of La Benevolencija's work during the War * Survival in Sarajevo: The story of La Benevolencija Jewish Bosnian history Jewish community organizations 1890s establishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina Non-profit organizations based in Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnian War ","title":"La Benevolencija"},{"id":"58434968","text":"Waleed Ahmed (born 4 December 1992) is a Pakistani cricketer.

The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MMRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi- role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF). On 14 December 2018 the Supreme Court upheld the Rafale deal, stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found. The Supreme Court delivered the final legal judgement on the controversy on 14 November 2019 and dismissed all the petitions seeking a review of its December 2018 judgement. Background Narendra Modi and Fran√ßois Hollande in a joint press conference on 10 April 2015 where Modi announced the intention to acquire 36 Rafales On 31 January 2012, the Indian Ministry of Defence announced that Dassault Rafale had won the MMRCA competition to supply the Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft, along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by Dassault Aviation fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be manufactured under license by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) with a transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology. The negotiations with Dassault dragged on due to disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so. In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion (‚Çπ1,86,000 crore), with each aircraft costing $120 million (‚Çπ746 crore). In February 2014, defence minister A. K. Antony said that the procedure of calculation of life-cycle cost was being re-examined and the contract could not be signed in the fiscal year 2013-14 due to budgetary constraints. In March 2014, HAL and Dassault signed a work share agreement to manage licensed manufacture. After the Indian general election in April‚ÄìMay 2014, the National Democratic Alliance led by Bharatiya Janata Party took control of the government from the United Progressive Alliance led by the Indian National Congress. As disagreements over cost and warranty for aircraft produced by HAL continued, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said that the Sukhoi Su-30MKI could be acquired as an alternative to Rafale. Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha disagreed, saying that the Su-30MKI and Rafale had different capabilities, they were not interchangeable. In February 2015, it was reported that the Rafale purchase was headed for cancellation as it had been misjudged to be the lowest bidder due to deficiencies in Dassault's bid. On 25 March 2015, Dassault's CEO √âric Trappier said that although the deal was taking time, it was \\"95 percent completed\\". During an official visit to France in April 2015, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi announced that India would acquire 36 fully built Rafales citing \\"critical operational necessity\\". In July 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar informed the Rajya Sabha that the tender for 126 aircraft had been withdrawn and negotiations for 36 aircraft had begun. In January 2016, India and France signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for acquisition of 36 aircraft without finalising the financial terms of the acquisition. In May 2016, the two sides arrived at a figure of ‚Ç¨7.87 billion (‚Çπ58,891 crore) for the agreement, compared to ‚Ç¨11.8 billion quoted in April 2015 and ‚Ç¨8.6 billion quoted in January 2016. Unnanmed government officials quoted by Press Trust of India said that the decrease in price was due to a change in escalation formula from a fixed 3.9% to a floating rate linked to European inflation indices along with a cap of 3.5%. Jean-Yves Le Drian and Manohar Parrikar signing the Rafale inter-governmental agreement in September 2016 In September 2016, India and France signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) for the acquisition of 36 aircraft following clearance from the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security. According to The Hindu, citing defence sources, the agreement provided for many components superior to those in the original deal, in particular the weapons package. It was reported that India would acquire 28 single-seat aircraft at a cost of ‚Ç¨91.1 million (‚Çπ681.7 crore) each and 8 dual-seat aircraft at a cost of ‚Ç¨94 million (‚Çπ703.4 crore) each. The deal also included tailor-made enhancements for the Indian Air Force at a cost of ‚Ç¨1.8 billion (‚Çπ13,470 crore), a weapons package costing ‚Ç¨710 million (‚Çπ5,313 crore) and a performance-based logistics agreement at a cost of ‚Ç¨353 million (‚Çπ2,641 crore). The weaponry procured included missiles such as MICA and Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and SCALP air-to- ground cruise missile. The India-specific enhancements included, among the dozen or so enhancements, the integration of an Israeli-made helmet-mounted display (HMD), radar warning receivers and low-band jammers. The agreement included a 50% \\"offset clause\\", which required the companies involved in the agreement‚Äîprimarily Dassault, Thales, Safran and MBDA‚Äîto invest 50% of the contract value (approximately ‚Ç¨3.9 billion or ‚Çπ30,000 crore) back into India, with 30% of the total (approximately ‚Ç¨1.2 billion or ‚Çπ9,000 crore) reserved for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Of this 50%, 74% (approximately ‚Ç¨2.9 billion or ‚Çπ22,200 crore) was to come from purchase of goods and services from India, which was expected to bolster the government's efforts to promote Indian defence equipment manufacturers. On 3 October 2016, Reliance Group and Dassault Aviation issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a 51:49 joint venture named Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL) to focus on aero structures, electronics and engine components as well as to foster research and development projects under the \\"Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured\\" (IDDM) initiative. Dassault intended to invest in excess of ‚Ç¨100 million in the joint venture as part of its offset obligations. The joint venture was to manufacture components for Legacy Falcon 2000 series of jets such as the nose, cockpit and doors at the DRAL facility in Nagpur starting from January 2018. Allegations =Allegations of price escalation= The day after the signing of IGA between France and India, Indian National Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per- aircraft cost from crore to crore. A couple of months later in November 2016, minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre informed the Lok Sabha that the cost of each Rafale aircraft acquired under the IGA was approximately ‚Çπ670 crore. In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from crore to crore. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations of procedural wrongdoing and said that approval from Cabinet Committee on Security had been obtained before signing of IGA. She said that the prices could not be compared as the tender for 126 aircraft and the agreement for 36 aircraft had different requirements. Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and said that the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed with better terms than the one that was being negotiated under MMRCA tender. French government officials also rejected the allegations of violation of procurement procedures. In an interview, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that Defence Procurement Procedure allows for government-to-government procurement and there was no procedural bypass in signing of the IGA. He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package including provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in earlier proposal. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables. =Allegations of favouritism= Modi and Hollande during an interaction with Indo-French CEO Forum on 10 April 2015. Anil Ambani can be seen in the second row, wearing headphones. In November 2017, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala alleged that HAL was bypassed in the Rafale contract and questioned the presence of Anil Ambani in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. He also alleged that the necessary government approvals were not obtained before the formation of joint venture between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi accused Indian prime minister Narendra Modi of dropping the requirement of licensed manufacture by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to ensure that the privately owned Reliance Defence Limited obtained an offset contract from Dassault. Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited denied the allegations by Surjewala and released a statement that he was present as a member of Indo- French CEO Forum. The statement added that no government approvals were required for foreign investments of up to 49%. Reliance also threatened to sue Congress if the allegations were not withdrawn. Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denied the allegations and said that transfer of technology to HAL would not be economically feasible in a smaller contract for 36 aircraft, which was an emergency purchase to make up for a decade-long delay. She said that no government approvals were required for the joint venture between two private companies. Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa also denied the allegations and added that technology would be transferred to DRDO. French government officials also rejected the allegations, saying that the offset contracts would be handed by four companies including Dassault and 500 companies would benefit in total. Controversy =2017= While campaigning for 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Rafale deal to attack Narendra Modi. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and favouritism towards Reliance Defence Limited. Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar justified the costs, saying that the cost of the aircraft is often eclipsed by the cost of equipment required to make it combat-ready. He said that the new agreement includes development costs for integration of a helmet-mounted display and a serviceability agreement. He blamed his predecessor in the previous United Progressive Alliance government, A. K. Antony for delaying the acquisition by creating uncertainty over the lowest bidder. In December 2017, Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha that the IGA had better aircraft pricing along with an improved maintenance package and a faster delivery schedule, although she admitted that a direct comparison of prices was not possible due to differences in deliverables. She added that negotiations under MMRCA tender had reached a deadlock and the 36 aircraft were being procured to meet a critical necessity of the Indian Air Force. =2018 budget session of the Indian parliament= In February 2018, in response to demands for details of the agreement to be made public, Nirmala Sitharaman said that the details were classified under a security agreement signed by Indian and French governments in 2008. She said that no state-owned or privately owned companies were included in the IGA. Rahul Gandhi alleged that the secrecy over pricing was evidence of a scam. Randeep Surjewala alleged that Eurofighter GmbH had reduced the price of its Typhoon jet by 20% and questioned why it was not considered. In response, the Ministry of Defence released a statement saying that the parliament had been informed with approximate cost of aircraft and revealing item-wise costs would compromise national security and violate the 2008 agreement. The statement went on to say that Dassault Aviation had not selected its offset partners yet and it was free to do so. On the Eurofighter question, the statement said that the previous government too had rejected an unsolicited bid from Eurofighter that was made a few days after the lowest bidder was announced in 2012. Finance minister and former defence minister Arun Jaitley defended the government's stand by providing examples of two instances where ministers under the previous UPA government had claimed that details of arms expenditure was classified and said that there were 15 such instances in total. Rahul Gandhi responded by presenting examples of three instances where ministers under the UPA government had provided pricing of defence deals. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined the Congress in its demands for details of the purchase to be made public. Aam Aadmi Party alleged that there was corruption involved in the Rafale deal and repeated the allegations of price escalation. In an interview with The Times of India, former chief of air staff Arup Raha said that the MMRCA deal collapsed due to disagreements between HAL and Dassault regarding costs and quality control. He said that there are additional deliverables in the new agreement, such as weapons, maintenance and training infrastructure and performance-based logistics. He added that he had a discussion with Manohar Parrikar before the decision to buy 36 flyaway aircraft was taken. India Today and The Economic Times, quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence officials, reported that the price that was being negotiated under the UPA government amounted to ‚Ç¨99 million for the aircraft without weapons and other addons while the cost of the same under the new agreement was ‚Ç¨91 million. They added that the new agreement included additional deliverables such as Meteor air-to-air missile that was absent in the MMRCA tender and 13 India-specific enhancements. The Indian Express, also quoting unnamed government officials, reported that the cost of ‚Çπ525 crore or ‚Ç¨79 million quoted by Congress leaders was from Dassault's 2007 bid for MMRCA, which included an annual price inflation of 3.9% that would have taken the costs to ‚Ç¨100.85 million in 2015. The report detailed the costs in the new agreement as ‚Ç¨91.7 million for each aircraft, ‚Ç¨1.8 billion for spare parts, ‚Ç¨1.7 billion for weather and terrain customizations, ‚Ç¨710 million for weapons and ‚Ç¨353 million for performance-based logistics along with index-based inflation with a cap of 3.5%. In an interview with India Today, French president Emmanuel Macron said that details of the deal has to be kept secret to protect the commercial interests of companies involved in the agreement and he would not have any objections if the Indian government decided to reveal some details of the agreement while keeping commercial sensitivities in mind. A few days later, India and France signed a new agreement that governs the exchange of classified information between the two countries to replace a similar agreement signed in 2008 that was about to expire in 2018. Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and former minister of state for defence Jitendra Singh, citing Dassault's annual report, alleged that Egypt and Qatar had paid ‚Çπ1,319 crore per aircraft in comparison to ‚Çπ1,670 crore paid by India, which represented an increase of ‚Çπ351 crore per aircraft. They alleged that acquiring 36 aircraft instead of 126 adversely affected national security. Dassault's CEO, √âric Trappier responded by saying that the numbers were not comparable as India's total included costs for Mirage 2000 support and the deliverables for each country was different. He said that India's deal included after-sales support which was absent from other countries' deals. On 12 March 2018, Subhash Bhamre informed the Rajya Sabha that the cost of each Rafale was approximately ‚Çπ670 crore, although this cost did not include the costs of \\"associated equipment, weapons, India specific enhancements, maintenance support and services\\". On 23 March 2018, Congress joined Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress Party in filing a motion of no confidence against the government. In April 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that ‚Çπ45,000 crore was stolen and given to \\"an industrialist friend\\", referring to Anil Ambani. In May 2018, Rahul Gandhi alleged that UPA had finalised a deal to buy Rafales at ‚Çπ700 crore, but Modi cancelled the transfer of technology contract wth HAL and gave it to \\"his friend's company\\", referring to Reliance Defence Limited. In June 2018, it was reported that Comptroller and Auditor General of India was close to finishing its report on the Rafale acquisition. =2018 monsoon session of the Indian parliament= The motion of no confidence was taken up on 20 July 2018. During the debate, Rahul Gandhi claimed that Sitharaman had refused to provide cost details of the Rafale acquisition citing a confidentiality agreement, but Macron had told him that such an agreement did not exist. He repeated the allegations of price escalation and claimed an industrialist has obtained a benefit of ‚Çπ45,000 crore. He also repeated the questions raised by Azad and Singh regarding comparison of Rafale acquisition cost between Egypt, Qatar and India. Sitharaman refuted the allegations and said that the confidentiality agreement was signed by UPA minister A. K. Antony on 25 January 2008 and displayed his signature on the agreement. The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released a statement contradicting Gandhi's claim, saying that the confidentiality agreement signed in 2008 applied to the IGA signed in 2016. The statement also quoted Macron's interview with India Today on their inability to release all the details. Rahul Gandhi refused to budge and said that he stood by the claim. Narendra Modi dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing, pointing to statements by Indian and French governments. Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma backed Rahul Gandhi, saying that he was present when Gandhi asked Macron if the French had any objections to price disclosure, for which Macron answered in the negative. He asserted that only classified information was protected from disclosure but the price was considered to be commercial information. Minister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad criticised Rahul Gandhi for dragging Macron into the controversy and said that the NDA government had purchased Rafale at a cost that was nine percent cheaper than the one being negotiated by UPA government. He said that Dassault's bid was ‚Ç¨79.3 million for each Rafale in 2007, but an escalation formula in the bid took the cost to ‚Ç¨100.85 million after it was opened. He added that if this cost is compared to the ‚Ç¨91.75 million negotiated in the IGA, the latter would be nine percent cheaper. He said that disclosure of other elements of the cost such as India-specific enhancements would not be in national interest and cited multiple examples when ministers in the previous UPA government had refused to disclose details on similar grounds. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the incorporation of Reliance Defence 12 days before Modi's announcement to acquire Rafales in April 2015 was evidence of crony capitalism that led to Dassault's decision to partner with an inexperienced Reliance Defence in October 2016. He added that Reliance Aerostructure was incorporated 14 days after the announcement and received its manufacturing license on 22 February 2016. He questioned Ministry of Defence's statement that no offset partner had been selected in light of Dassault and Reliance's partnership. He also highlighted Reliance's presentation to investors that Rafale offsets was worth crore and Rafale life cycle opportunity was valued at crore. Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Reliance had obtained both contracts for a total of crore and termed it as a theft. Congress demanded that a joint parliamentary committee should be formed to investigate the deal. Rajesh Dhingra, the CEO of Reliance Defence, said that Reliance had not received any Rafale-related contract from Ministry of Defence. He said that Dassault did not have to inform the ministry about its offset partners till September 2019 and share of offsets can only be calculated after all the French companies involved in the contract make their disclosures to the ministry. He said that Reliance cannot get crore of offsets as Dassault's share was only 25% of the total. On Reliance's inexperience, he said that the joint venture‚ÄîDassault Reliance Aerospace Limited‚Äîhad 90 years of experience through Dassault. He said that Reliance made its entry into defence in late 2014 and incorporated multiple companies in the months that followed. He dismissed connections of incorporation dates to Modi's announcement as contrived. Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan demanded a CAG audit of the Rafale deal and alleged that there was a cost escalation of crore per aircraft. They added that the aircraft were ordered in the same configuration as before and that other government officials were unaware of the plans to acquire 36 aircraft instead of 126. They said that the Reliance subsidiary that got an offset contract was inexperienced and incorporated days before IGA was signed. Arun Jaitley denied the allegations. They alleged that Modi had negatively affected India's national security by reducing the aircraft to be acquired from 126 to 36 and had not consulted air force and defence ministry before doing so. The Economic Times reported that the acquisition of 126 aircraft was dropped as Dassault would not be the lowest bidder if HAL were to manufacture Rafale under license, due to additional labour costs. The report added that Dassault's refusal to provide warranty for all aircraft also contributed to the decision. In response to continued attacks from Congress, Arun Jaitley said that Congress had quoted several different prices from 520 to 700 crores. He questioned if Congress was aware of the escalation formula in Dassault's 2007 bid that would have substantially increased the price by 2015. He said that price comparison by Congress was misleading as price of basic aircraft cannot be compared price of \\"fully loaded\\" weaponised aircraft. He said the basic aircraft was 9% cheaper and the overall agreement was 20% cheaper in the IGA after taking currency variations and cost escalation into account. He said that Indian government had no involvement in selection of private companies as offset partners and it was up to the vendor to make that choice. He said the agreement was signed after obtaining necessary approvals following negotiations that lasted over a year. M. J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, wrote in an op- ed published by The Times of India that a bribe of crore in a contract worth crore wasn't plausible. He said that Dassault's bid had been accepted at crore along with a price escalation formula that would have increased the price to crore in 2015. He added that IGA price of crore for each basic aircraft represented a 9% decrease in price. He wrote that the additional items required to make the aircraft operational in the earlier deal would take the total to crore and as a result the IGA price was 20% lower. He said the offsets worth crore were to be awarded to 70 over companies including a few state-owned firms, which meant Reliance couldn't profit to the tune of crore from offsets. Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa (right) standing in front of a Rafale Vice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo said that the controversy was a result of ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy. Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts. Air Marshal Shyam Bihari Prasad Sinha, a past member of cost negotiation committee for the older deal, said that it fell through due to irreconcilable differences between HAL and Dassault on transfer of technology and ownership of manufacturing. Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said that there were several precedents for acquiring two squadrons of aircraft through an inter-governmental agreement when the air force is short of aircraft. Nambiar added that the difference will be made up through a separate process for acquiring 114 aircraft. Shourie, Sinha and Bhushan said that the government was forcing the officers to lie about the deal. Nirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France. She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn't take over the warranty. She said that the figure of crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational. T. Suvarna Raju, a former chairman of HAL, said that HAL had the capability to manufacture the jets, but conceded that the desired cost might not have been achieved. He also said that HAL could guarantee the jets and added that Dassault and HAL had signed a work share agreement which was submitted to the government. Rahul Gandhi referred to Raju's statement and accused Sitharaman of lying. Unnamed government sources quoted by the Indo-Asian News Service and United News of India said that Raju's statement was incorrect as HAL had written to the government in October 2012 and July 2014 regarding disagreements between HAL and Dassault on work and responsibility sharing. They added that HAL and Dassault also could not agree on the number of man hours required to manufacture the aircraft. Congress leaders met Central Vigilance Commissioner K. V. Chowdary on 24 September 2018 requested him to initiate an investigation into the Rafale deal. They also met Comptroller and Auditor General of India Rajiv Mehrishi twice on 19 September and 4 October 2018 and requested him to conduct a forensic audit on the Rafale deal. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav joined the Congress in its demand for an investigation by a joint parliamentary committee. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the older deal could not move forward due to a lack of offsets for Sanjay Bhandari's Offset India Solutions, who he said was an associate of Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra. Vadra denied the allegations and termed it as a \\"political witch hunt\\". Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar said that all price details should be disclosed as Sushma Swaraj had demanded full disclosure during Bofors scandal. Quoting unnamed sources from Dassault, NDTV reported that Dassault picked Reliance as it had land close to a runway and because Anil Ambani took over defence business from his brother Mukesh. The report added that Dassault had a pre- existing partnership with Mukesh's Reliance Industries Limited dating back to 2012 and the negotiations later switched over to Anil's Reliance Defence during Aero India in February 2015. Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar said that a single company cannot get crore worth of offsets as Dassault's share was only crore. Reliance sued NDTV regarding its reporting on the matter which was noted by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. =Fran√ßois Hollande= In August 2018, The Indian Express reported that Reliance Entertainment funded a film produced by former president of France Fran√ßois Hollande's partner Julie Gayet when Rafale negotiations were ongoing. When asked to comment on this, Hollande told Mediapart that the Indian government had proposed the name of Reliance and that they had no choice in the matter. He added that due to this, there was no reason for Reliance to do him any favours. He said that Kev Adams negotiated the funding for the film and Gayet said that Adam's talent agency My Family had approached and secured funding from Reliance and she was merely presented with Reliance as a partner after the fact. The French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs contradicted Hollande by releasing a statement saying that the French companies had \\"full freedom\\" to choose Indian partners for executing their offset obligations and that French companies had utilized the freedom to sign agreements with multiple Indian companies. Dassault also released a statement saying that the decision to partner with Reliance was entirely its own and that it had already partnered with other multiple Indian firms too. Indian Ministry of Defence too released a statement saying that neither the Indian nor the French government had any involvement in Dassault's decision to partner with Reliance. Hollande later reiterated that the French government did not choose Reliance. His spokesperson said that Hollande was referring to the new deal for 36 aircraft when he said that the Indian government made the proposal. When asked by Agence France-Presse if the Indian government had pressured Dassault to partner with Reliance, he said that he was unaware and redirected the question to Dassault. Reliance Entertainment said that it had no relationship with Julie Gayet or her company Rogue International. It added that the financing partner was Visvires Capital and the investment was limited to 15% of the film's budget. The company's statement said that the investment was made six months after Hollande stepped down. Supreme Court verdict In September 2018, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a public interest writ petition seeking cancellation of the inter-governmental agreement alleging corruption. Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that the Congress would wait until the required documentation is in hand before approaching a court. On 10 October The Supreme Court asked the Central government to provide details of the decision making process in the Rafale deal with France in a sealed cover by 29 October. On 14 December 2018, the court dismissed all the petitions seeking a probe into the alleged irregularities in the deal, and gave a clean chit to the Union government on all the three aspects, viz., the decision making, pricing and selection of Indian offset partner. In its ruling, the court said it has \\"studied the material carefully\\" and is satisfied with the decision making process, and that it found no evidence of wrongdoing. It expressed its satisfaction on the pricing aspect, after investigating the details, which were provided to it by the government. It said that it had reluctantly asked the government to provide the details pertaining to the pricing in a sealed envelope, after initial reservation, coupled with the government's invocation of a confidentiality clause under the intergovernmental agreement. \\"We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP (UPA regime‚Äôs) as well as under the inter-governmental agreement. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise,\\" the court said while ruling that it did not consider it necessary to repudiate the government's assertion that \\"there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft\\". It further added that it found no fault with the government's assertion that it got better terms relating to maintenance and weapons package. \\"It is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be kept in a confidential domain,\\" the court said. On the aspect of offset partner, the court rejected allegations of commercial favouritism, citing the lack of any substantive material. \\"We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with (it),\\" the court said. The court said \\"we find no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts [sic] by the Indian government,\\" adding that the \\"perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this court, especially in such matters.\\" Chief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi while writing the judgement for the three-member bench, ruled that, \\"Adequate military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a matter of utmost concern for the nation. The empowerment of defence forces with adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.\\" =Reactions= Notwithstanding the Supreme Court's verdict, the main opposition party, Congress, repeated its allegations of corruption against the government and continued to demand a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the deal, saying that the supreme court was \\"not the forum to decide the issue of such a sensitive defence contract.\\" The Indian government promptly rejected the demand. Congress questioned the court's justification of selection of Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as offsets partner in the deal. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the demand for a JPC probe, and alleged that the government misled the court on the issue, stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report was not shared with the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as yet, and in fact no such report is in the public domain, contrary to the court's order. Mallikarjun Kharge, a senior Congress leader and the chairman of the PAC, who was present along with Gandhi at the press conference, citing personal communication with the deputy CAG, said that neither the PAC, nor the CAG, was in possession of the said report. The ruling party BJP, on the other hand, welcomed the verdict, while saying that the falsehood on the issue was exposed. Dassault Aviation, on the same day of the verdict, issued a statement to the press welcoming the Indian Supreme Court's verdict. \\"Dassault Aviation welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of India rendered today dismissing all petitions filed on the Rafale Contract signed on 23rd September 2016 in the frame of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and France,\\" the statement read. It also reiterated its commitment to ensure \\"successful production in India through Dassault Reliance Joint Venture in Nagpur as well as through a full-fledged supply chain network\\". The petitioners in the case, former minister Yashwant Sinha, former journalist Arun Shourie and lawyer Prashant Bhushan, issued a press statement expressing 'shock' and 'disappointment' over the court's decision to dismiss their petitions and said that the verdict \\"neither addressed the documented facts nor dealt with their main prayer seeking an investigation into the deal to purchase the French fighter jets,\\" adding that \\"some of the facts mentioned in the court judgment are not only not on record but are patently incorrect\\". While claiming that \\"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or placed in the public domain,\\" the trio accused the court of taking a \\"conservative view of judicial review in cases of defence deal corruption involving high functionaries.\\" The trio claimed that the verdict had used as facts, the statements by the government through affidavits and the sealed covers handed only to the court and not with the petitioners, and that these factually incorrect statements were based on the statements made by the government to the court in sealed covers and the factual inaccuracies show how dangers associated in verdict based on unverified statements. They demanded a \\"full public disclosure of all the facts\\" along with \\"a comprehensive and independent investigation into the deal\\". On 16 December 2018, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a \\"sharp attack\\" on Congress for its refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision to reject the petitioners' demands of probes, and accused it of lying, saying: \\"The country's defence ministry is also a liar. The country's defence minister is also false. Officers of Indian Air Force are also liars. The French government is also false. Now they have started to call the highest court of the country a liar too\\". The BJP, on the same day, announced that it will held as many as 70 press conferences across different areas of India to \\"expose\\" the Congress for what it said was plotting conspiracy against the Modi government on the issue of Rafale deal. Samajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had previously demanded a JPC probe, took a stance contrary to that of the Congress after the court's verdict, saying that the decision on the issue has been given by the Supreme court, which \\"is supreme in the eyes of people\\", and hence doubts, if any, should be raised in that court. Upon being asked about the change in his party's stance, Yadav said that his party had demanded a JPC probe before the Supreme court's verdict. \\"I had said JPC should be set up as there can be many things in it. But now the verdict has come and the Supreme Court has deliberated on all angles,\\" he said. Communist Party of India (Marxist) supported the calls for a JPC. =Plea for corrections in verdict= On 15 December 2018, the Union Defence Ministry in a press conference suggested that the Supreme court may have misinterpreted the government's statements on the Rafale deal and requested corrections. The ministry during the press conference had pointed to the mixing of the tenses, \\"perhaps on account of misinterpretation of a couple of sentences in a note handed over to this Hon'ble Court in a sealed cover.\\" The government filed an eight-page application for corrections in the verdict by the Supreme Court stating \\"observations in the judgment have also resulted in a controversy in the public domain.\\" By proposing these correction, the government tried to rectify that the CAG report had not yet submitted its report and the PAC has not examined it. No redacted portion, has been placed either in the Parliament or in the public domain. The ministry claimed that the note simply mentioned the procedures followed on CAG reports and the note was not specific to the Rafale deal CAG report. The verdict had mentioned four steps related to the CAG report out of which 3 were incorrect. The court has not responded to the governments application as it is closed for winter. On 16 December, the Congress asked the Supreme Court, not to entertain the Governments application of rectification of judgement. Congress also urged the court to recall the Rafale judgment as being \\"self-contradictory\\" and to issue notices to the government for \\"perjury and contempt of court as it provided false information to the top court.\\" The Chairman of the PAC Mallikarjun Kharge and the Congress stated that \\"no portion of the CAG report has been placed before Parliament or was in the public domain\\". The Government's correction application may have an open court hearing in January, along with a review petition from the petitioners. = Final Supreme Court judgement = On 14 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all the petitions seeking review of its verdict delivered on 14 December 2018 on the controversy and upheld the previous judgment stating that no irregularities or corruption have been found in the deal.

He is best known for his 1674 defense of Martinique against Dutch forces under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, where he was captain of a warship that played a critical role in driving the Dutch land forces off their beachhead. Early years (1642‚Äì74) Thomas Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg was born on 21 March 1642 in Mouzon, Ardennes. He came from a Saxon family that had settled in Mouzon. His father was Nicolas Renart, sieur des Mahomets. His mother, born Marin, was dame d'Amblimont. His father died in the siege of Mouzon in 1653. When his older brother died in the Battle of Valenciennes (1656) he inherited the seigneury of Amblimont, near Mouzon. Amblimont obtained a position as captain in the regiment of Jean-Armand de Joyeuse, Marquis de Grandpr√©. He joined that regiment on 20 September 1656. In November 1663 Amblimont transferred to the navy as lieutenant de vaisseau. In 1669 he was capitaine de vaisseau in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime. That year he participated in the Cretan War as aide-de-camp of Almeiras. Defense of Martinique (1674) The Third Anglo-Dutch War was launched by the English and French in 1672, but the allies were outmatched by the Dutch forces under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, who inflicted several defeats. After the English had withdrawn from their alliance with France, de Ruyter appeared off Martinique on 16 July 1674 with a fleet that included 18 warships, support vessels and 15 troop transports with 3,400 soldiers. The French were expecting de Ruyter but thought Fort Royal (now Fort-de-France) was impregnable, so had concentrated their forces up the coast at Saint-Pierre. De Ruyter directed his force to Fort Royal, but was becalmed on the first day, giving the French time for urgent efforts to improve the defenses. Dutch assault on Fort-Royal, 1674 The governor of Martinique Antoine Andr√© de Sainte-Marthe arrived to take command at dawn, by which time the French had booms across the harbour mouth and enough men to work the batteries. Two armed ship were anchored off the fort: the 44-gun royal frigate Jeux under Amblimont and the 22-gun merchantman Saint Eustache. At the start of the attempted Invasion of Martinique de Ruyter's force was greeted by heavy gunfire when it entered the harbour in the morning on 20 July. 1,000 Dutch troops were landed at 9:00 a.m. but found themselves trapped below high cliffs, exposed to fire from the French batteries and from the two armed ships. They broke into a rum warehouse and all discipline was lost. The commanders of the Dutch land forces tried to take shelter below a cliff, but Amblimont at once landed six guns from the Jeux and opened fire on the new position. Dutch morale collapsed when their commander Van Uyttenhowe was badly wounded. The Dutch troops escaped by boat around 1:00 a.m., made a second assault at 2:00 p.m., and again were forced to retreat. The Dutch had lost 143 dead and 318 wounded against 15 French dead. They abandoned the effort, sailed north that night, and eventually returned to Europe in disarray. King Louis XIV of France ennobled Sainte-Marthe for his victory against the Dutch. The king had a medal struck to commemorate this feat of arms. Amblimont was made the first marquis d'Amblimont by letters patent. Later career (1674‚Äì96) In 1677 Amblimont cruised in the Antilles in the Alycon in the squadron of Admiral Jean II d'Estr√©es and assisted in the seizure of Tobago. On 7 May 1678 d'Estr√©es launched an expedition from Saint Christopher Island against the Dutch base of Cura√ßao. He had 18 of the king's warships supported by more than 12 buccaneer vessels. His course was down the Lesser Antilles and then west past the Orchila, Roques and Aves islands. The fleet strayed too far south when near the Aves Archipelago and during the night of 11‚Äì12 May 1678 the fleet began to strike the reefs. Amblimont's D√©fenseur (50) was among the warships that sank. Others were the flagship Terrible (70), Belliqueux (70), Tonnant (66), Bourbon (56), Prince and Hercule. Six other ships sank, 500 men were drowned and the French lost most of their guns. The shattered remnants of the force had to retreat towards Saint-Domingue (Haiti). In 1680 Aublimont was made a commander of the Order of Saint Lazarus. In 1683, sailing with Jean Bart on the Mod√©r√©, he helped capture two Spanish vessels in the vicinity of C√°diz. In 1686, still on the Mod√©r√©, he was part of a small squadron under Job Forant(fr) and engaged in battle near Cape Finisterre. On 2 May 1687 Amblimont left La Rochelle on the 52-gun Arc-en-ciel in command of a squadron with two other warships, Perle and Profond, and two transports carrying twelve companies of marine troops to combat the Iroquois threat. The flotilla made a fast passage and reached Quebec City on 29 May 1687. In January 1688 Amblimont married Catherine Balarin de Parisot. Their son, Claude Thomas Renart de Fuschamberg d'Amblimont, also became a squadron leader. Amblimont distinguished himself at the start of the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) in a battle where, with four frigates, he attacked five English vessels, sank two, burned a third and took a fourth. On 27 July 1689 as commander of the Profond Amblimont destroyed a Dutch squadron off the Texel. On 24 May 1692 on the Victorieux he took part in the Battle of La Hougue, for which he was promoted to squadron commander. He was promoted to chef d'escadre in January 1693. He was made a commander of the Order of Saint Louis when that order was established later in 1693. Governor general of the Antilles (1696‚Äì1700) Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac, governor general of the French Antilles, died on 10 June 1696 and was succeeded as interim governor general by Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut. Amblimont was appointed governor general on 1 September 1696, and was received in Martinique on 14 March 1697. He died in Martinique on 17 August 1700. Guitaut was again interim governor until Charles Desnotz took office on 23 May 1701.

Clough (August 21, 1858 ‚Äì 1936) was an American newspaper publisher and editor. At the end of the 19th-century, five women in Michigan owned, edited, and personally managed their own newspapers, one of whom was Clough. For eighteen years, she published The Brooklyn Exponent. She was the recording secretary of the Michigan Woman's Press Association (MWPA). Early years Ethlyn Theresa Packard was born in Monroeville, Ohio, August 21, 1858. She was a daughter of Daniel and Cornelia (Hubbell) Packard. Her parents were natives of Ohio. Career On July 21, 1876, she married Charles W. Clough, newspaper publisher, removing to Attica, Ohio. In 1878, they removed to Clinton, Ohio where the husband founded the Local. In 1881, her husband founded The Brooklyn Exponent. There being no other paper in Brooklyn, Michigan, and Mr. Clough being a practical printer, the location was most favorable for the establishment of a good weekly newspaper, and the Exponent soon commanded patronage and support. But, never robust, the hard labor soon began to tell upon him. At her husband's death, September 30, 1884, Mrs. Clough assumed the management of the paper, having learned how to manage a newspaper accidentally during her husband's lifetime. Mrs. Clough, now a widow with four young children, was conscious of her abilities, and recognizing the necessity of having someone at the head of the business who would have a financial interest in its success, she at once assumed the responsibility of editor and publisher, and conducted the business, supporting herself and family of three children, one daughter, Adelaide M., having been adopted by her husband's sister at the time of his death. Affiliations She was a charter member of the MWPA, and in 1890, was elected a member of the committee on constitution and by-laws, and in 1893, became the recording secretary. She also served as president of Brooklyn's Saturday Night circle, a member of the Bay View Reading Club, which focused on literary study. Personal life Clough's sons and daughters were named respectively: Charles R., Adelaide M., Edward F. and Eleanor Maude. She died in 1936 and was buried at Oxford Cemetery, in Oxford, Ohio.

History The Guildhall was built in 1834-35 to replace the town's original 16th century guildhall and market house. Owing to the inconvenient position of the original hall at Fore Street, the decision to erect a replacement was finalised in 1833. The foundation stone of the new hall was laid on 20 December 1834,The Western Flying Post, Sherborne and Yeovil Mercury - 29 December 1834 - page 3 and the building first opened on 21 September 1835. Designed by the local architect Richard Carver of Taunton in the Classical style, it originally incorporated a town hall, market house and butchery, and had cost over ¬£3,000 to build. The guildhall clock was installed to celebrate the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne in 1837. The building has been Grade II* listed since 1950. Much of the building's interior was remodelled around 1970, with the entire building later undergoing renovation work between 1998 and 2003. The weather vane on top of the building, which is high and weighs was taken down for restoration by a local blacksmith in spring 2002. The guildhall was the meeting place of the municipal borough of Chard, formed in response to the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. It ceased to be the local seat of government when, following further local government re-organisation, the enlarged South Somerset Council was formed in 1974. The Guildhall has housed the offices of Chard Town Council since 2009, and is also regularly used by local community groups for a variety of activities. The mechanism for the guildhall clock, weighing , was removed during the renovation of the building and returned, fully restored, in spring 2008. Architecture The Guildhall is built of Hamstone sourced from nearby Ham Hill, with slate roofs. The two-storey building has a T-shaped plan and is designed in the Classical style. The facade features a Doric portico with a double row of Tuscan columns at ground level and Doric columns on the second- storey. A domed cupola, featuring clock faces on three sides, sits on top of the facade's pediment. Both the council chamber and mayor's parlour survive unaltered.

Page 222 Arthurian romance by Raoul de Houdenc. It consists of 5938Mathias Friedwagner, 1897. His edition is based on all of the manuscripts octosyllabic verses. Meraugis also briefly appears as a character in Raoul's La Vengeance RaguidelMessire Gauvain ou la vengeance de Raguidel, edited by C. Hippeau, 1862. The reference to Meraugis is on page 45 (line 1269).  Plot  Two knights, Meraugis and Gorvain, travel to a tournament where they meet the beautiful Lidoine, heiress to the kingdom of Cavalon now that her father has died. The two knights tell each other that they are in love with her, which immediately leads to a scuffle. Lidoine intervenes and insists that the matter must be settled by a court, not a battle. In Cardeuil, the judgment is in favor of Meraugis, who says he loves her not just for her looks but for her nobleness and valor. Gorvain, outraged, challenges Meraugis to a duel, but when the queen intervenes he agrees to leave. Meanwhile, Lidoine asks Meraugis to leave for a year and do heroic deeds, and after a year, she will judge if he is worthy of her love or not. He agrees. Shortly after, a dwarf appears during the king's dinner and challenges them to locate Gawain, who is missing. Meraugis agrees after seeking Lidoine's consent, who not only consents, but asks to come with them. Meraugis locates Gawain in the 'city without a name', trapped on an island, held captive by a woman who controls the only boat. In order to escape, Meraugis feigns defeat to Gawain, and, under cover of darkness, goes into the castle on the island, locks the woman in her room and steals some of her clothes. He impersonates her to get the boatmen to come and pick up him and Gawain in order to escape the island. Lidoine witnesses this, and, believing Meraugis is dead, flees and goes to Belchis for protection. However, he betrays her and instead holds her captive. She gets a message via a woman named Avice to Gorvain who comes to free her. Meanwhile, Meraugis is discovered barely alive and taken to Belchis's castle where he is well looked after. When he is healed, he notices Lidoine is there. He dresses in all white armor and challenges Gawain to a duel. When Meraugis reveals to Gawain his true identity, Gawain surrenders and is taken prisoner by Meraugis. Belchis is extremely impressed and he and his knights pledge loyalty to Meraugis. At this point, with Belchis's knights loyal to him, he reveals who he is, and frees Gawain and Lidoine. However, Lidoine has promised her kingdom to Gorvain for coming to her aid, so Meraugis challenges him to one final duel. Meraugis wins, but since he and Gorvain were formerly friends, he exiles him instead of killing him. In the Berlin manuscript (but not the Vatican or Vienna manuscripts), Meraugis gives Avice to Gorvain, and both couples live happily ever afterG. Paris, 1888, page 234.

The episode was written by Matt Selman and Renee Ridgeley. In the episode, Marge Simpson and Homer Simpson take part in a reality TV show. Plot The Simpson family is watching a reality TV show called \\"The Amazing Place\\", a parody of the survival show Survivor. Marge reveals her expert knowledge of the show‚Äôs contestant challenges comes from her lifetime of watching the past 47 seasons. Bart and Lisa heavily encourage Homer and Marge to audition, Marge breaks down and, in the attic, shows them samples from every season‚Äôs past tryouts for the show, which were all rejected. The kids decide to edit past efforts into a new submission without telling Marge and Homer. Bart feeds marshmallows to Santa's Little Helper while Lisa edits a video of Marge and Homer's rejection letter openings, which they also recorded, and shows it to the producers at an in-person audition. The producers are attracted to the idea of rewarding an ultimate fan of the show and the show‚Äôs host Tad Tuckerbag joins them at home to deliver the news. At the first trial, while still at ‚ÄúThe Amazing Place‚Äùs tarmac, the contestants play ‚ÄúSuitcase Stowaway‚Äù to find an item in their own luggage that doesn‚Äôt belong. Marge and Homer immediately lose and are ‚Äúshelliminated‚Äù. Heartbroken, they then find out they cannot leave for six weeks and are to be sequestered at the airport hotel. While Marge is miserable and homesick, Homer is happy on all the freebies they are given including room service food, booze, and movies. Homer tries to cheer Marge with a musical number ‚ÄúAirport Hotel‚Äù, sung to the 1956 Elvis Presley song ‚ÄúHeartbreak Hotel‚Äù. Back at home, Bart has convinced a number of school friends to help dig a hole in the yard for a pool, Patty and Selma are babysitting but they approve of the plan. At the hotel, the parents find the post production room where Marge discovers that Homer caused their loss, eating the ‚Äústowaway‚Äù item, a bar of chocolate, infuriating her. In a black and white vignette, in homage to Edward Albee‚Äòs 1962 play 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', where a bitter and frustrated middle age couple entertains a younger couple, Marge and Homer have over a younger eliminated couple. Marge proceeds to make Homer jealous by flirting with Nick, the husband. The next day, it is announced to all the then eliminated contestants, that they can re-enter the show, but only if they do the ‚ÄúDead Weight Drop‚Äù by dumping their spouse if they screwed up. Everyone else declines but Marge selects Nick. The final ‚ÄúMango Tango‚Äù challenge involves picking mangoes, creating mangorita cocktails with them, and crossing a log-covered trench while playing a penny whistle to a pack of monkeys. Marge loses the contest by not following the recipe, but Homer is happy that this time it wasn't his fault. Production Executive producer and co-writer Matt Selman stated that the inspiration for the episode was feeling bad for so many years for the first person kicked off of Top Chef, which he deemed to be \\"worse than not being on the show at all.\\" The idea to parody Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in the middle of the episode came from Selman's wife and co- writer of the episode Renee Ridgeley, who herself has a small cameo as the character Honey in the segment. Actor George Segal was only asked to guest star and record his part within a week of the episode going to air. This was because it was only when a friend told Selman that George Segal had said Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was his favorite movie he was ever in they thought about getting him, so the staff tracked him down as fast as they could. Selman stated that he was \\"delighted to reprise the voice.\\" When directing Segal repising his role of Nick, Selman simply told him \\"just do it how Mike Nichols said to.\\" The episode was supposed to air in season 29, but was later postponed to season 30 as \\"Flanders' Ladder\\" was set to be the season 29 finale.Al Jean's TwitterThe Futon Critic.com Cultural references The Amazing Place - the fictional reality adventure game show, which provides basis of the episode - is based on similar reality shows such as Survivor and The Amazing Race. The show's host, Tad Tuckerbag, is based on veteran New Zealand television personality and host of American version of The Amazing Race, Phil Keoghan (and is voiced by fellow New Zealander Rhys Darby). The episode parodies the 1966 film Who‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf? with George Segal reprising his role from the film. Reception Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3 out of 5 points stating, \\"Public humiliation is the best humiliation. The Simpson family may have bad memories when it comes to their own public appearances, but they thrive on the repressed anguish that comes from being under the microscope. The premise was fresh in showing us how hotel living could be the answer to all life's problems. 'Heartbreak Hotel' offers a diverse entry into the season, which is still underwhelming. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- stating, \\"‚ÄòHeartbreak Hotel‚Äô does a fine job at supplying a motivation that‚Äîwhile new to us‚Äîis true to the characters. Especially Marge, whose decades-long addiction to the reality competition travel show The Amazing Place is seen to be rooted in the long Homer-less hours as a football-and-Moe's widow. Marge explains that, while Homer has his pursuits, she has hers in the form of an encyclopedic knowledge of every hashtagged event, stunt, and twist her favorite show can throw at its grasping contestants.\\" ‚ÄúHeartbreak Hotel‚Äù scored a 1.8 rating with a 7 share and was watched by 4.60 million people, making ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù Fox's highest rated show of the night.

It was invented around 1895 by Leo Hirschfeld, who would later invent the Tootsie Roll. Bromangelon is regarded as the first commercially successful gelatin dessert powder, having been mass-marketed several years before Jell-O, which would eventually drive Bromangelon off the market. Name The origin of the name \\"Bromangelon\\" is unknown. At a Boston exhibition in 1895, representatives of the manufacturer, Stern and Saalberg, Co., claimed the name meant \\"angel's food.\\" But the 1903 edition of the American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record reported a significantly different etymology; ‚ÄúWhat is Bromangelon? ... A foul spirit. From bromos, a stench, and angellus, a messenger, angel, or spirit.‚Äù In some advertisements, the name was broken up as \\"Bro-Man-Gel-On.\\" This may have been a way to make the long name easier to remember or pronounce, or it may have been intended to imply that the name was a portmanteau, like Nabisco's original meaning of \\"National Biscuit Company\\". Product history Bromangelon initially came in four flavors: lemon, orange, raspberry, and strawberry. Over the next 15 years, cherry, chocolate, and peach were introduced, so by 1910, the total number of flavors was brought to seven. This 1895 advertisement shows the four flavors that were available when Bromangelon was invented: lemon, orange, raspberry, and strawberry. Gelatin, a product made from animal collagen, had been used in cooking since the 15th century. However, it was expensive and time-consuming to make, because chefs had to extract it from boiled animal bones and connective tissues by hand. This put it out of reach for many home cooks, and making a gelatin dessert or aspic was regarded as a food-science curiosity reserved for the wealthiest socialites. Bromangelon was not the first powdered gelatin. It had been invented in 1845 by industrialist Peter Cooper, who built the first American steam-powered locomotive, the Tom Thumb. However, Cooper was more interested in making glue than gelatin, so it never caught on. Knox Gelatine, which hit the market shortly before Bromangelon, was popular but still required the user to soak unflavored sheets in water to activate them. Bromangelon was the first flavored instant gelatin powder. Sold in 10- or 15-cent packets (the equivalent of about $3 or $4.50 in 2018), it was quick, cheap, and tasty. Suddenly, home cooks could whip up sophisticated-looking desserts and side dishes in only the advertised \\"2 minutes time\\". People began to use Bromangelon in a variety of dishes, some more outlandish than others. A 1910 hostess' guide from Stern and Saalberg, the manufacturers, recommended new interpretations of classics, such as such as roast turkey with cherry Bromangelon, Bromangelon sherbet, and Bromangelon wine jellies. To a 1909 cookbook of the Woman‚Äôs Club of San Mateo, one Mrs. Brady submitted \\"Macaroon Bromangelon\\", an elaborate trifle-like dessert of ladyfingers, whipped cream, Sherry-soaked macaroons, and strawberry Bromangelon. A particularly elaborate recipe came from a 1900 ad in Good Housekeeping Magazine, which offers \\"Shredded Wheat Biscuit Jellied Apple Sandwich\\". The recipe involves taking what appears to be huge blocks of shredded wheat, stuffing them with stewed apples, and soaking the entire arrangement in a layer of pink Bromangelon. Jell-O was trademarked in 1897, two years after Bromangelon was invented. It was only a minor success until 1904, when the company adopted a new marketing strategy featuring illustrated ads in Ladies' Home Journal, free giveaways, and a kid-centered message. Sales of Jell-O skyrocketed to about $250,000 a year, or about $7 million in today‚Äôs dollars. Bromangelon could never reach that level of popularity, and the product faded away by the 1930s. Connection to Tootsie Rolls The inventor of Bromangelon, Austrian Jewish immigrant confectioner Leo Hirschfeld, trademarked Tootsie Rolls in 1908. Although the precise nature of a connection between the two products is not known, the invention of chocolate Bromangelon around the turn of the 20th century might hold a clue as to what Hirschfeld was working on at the time. When representatives from Stern and Saalberg, the manufacturer of Bromangelon (and later, Tootsie Rolls) came to Barre, Vermont, in October 1907 to demonstrate Bromangelon, they also brought another product called \\"Tootsies\\", which the Barre Daily Times reported \\"is made from Bromangelon.\\" Today's Tootsie Rolls do not contain gelatin, so it is unclear if this was an early prototype or a completely separate product. However, it is likely that, at the very least, the fact that Hirschfeld delivered a success with Bromangelon put him on the map at Stern and Saalberg, which allowed him the financial and institutional backing he needed to launch a major candy product. By 1913, Hirschfeld was the vice president of Stern and Saalberg, which later became the Sweets Corporation of America in 1917 and Tootsie Roll Industries in 1966. Mascot This vintage advertisement for Bromangelon features Tattling Tootsie, an early mascot inspired by the inventor's daughter, Clara, whose nickname, \\"Tootsie\\" eventually was the namesake of the Tootsie Roll.

He was particularly active during the period known as the Anarchy at Samarra (861‚Äì870).  Career  A member of the Mus'abid family, al-Husayn was a blood relation of the Tahirid family, and he is occasionally referred to in the sources by the nisba of \\"al-Tahiri.\\"; . During the caliphate of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861) he was appointed as governor of Fars by his cousin Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim in 850, and was responsible for putting to death his uncle Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Mus'abi, the previous holder of that position.; ; . In 858 he is mentioned as being a member of the al-Mutawakkil's bodyguard (haras) when the caliph made his journey to Damascus, and in the following year he is reported to have been appointed as chamberlain (hajib) upon the death of Ibrahim ibn al-Hasan ibn Sahl.; . Following the death of al-Mutawakkil in 861, al-Husayn returned to Baghdad and became a commander for the governor of the city, his second cousin Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir. In 864 he was selected by Muhammad to lead an army against the Alid Yahya ibn Umar, who had rebelled in Kufa, and after a short campaign he was successful in defeating and killing Yahya in battle.; ;; . During the civil war of 865‚Äì866 between the rival caliphs al-Musta'in and al-Mu'tazz he played a prominent role as one of Muhammad's lieutenants in defending Baghdad against a yearlong siege, having initially commanded the defense of the Shammasiyyah Gate on the east side of the city and later helping to repulse an assault by the besieging Samarran army. In the summer of that year he was charged with recapturing the town of Anbar from the forces of al-Mu'tazz, but despite having a great number of troops he was twice repulsed with heavy losses, causing Muhammad to publicly chastise both him and his men as a result.; . After the end of the war al- Husayn appears to have remained in the service of Muhammad until the latter's death in 867, and he participated in the suppression of a troop riot in Baghdad in 866. Under Muhammad's successor Ubaydallah ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir he was placed in charge of the double bridge of Baghdad and the districts of Qatrabbul, Maskin and Anbar and additionally held command over the non-Arab and Shakiriyyah troops. He had a much more tense relationship with the next governor Sulayman ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, who stripped him of his positions and imprisoned his subordinates, and a dispute between him and several other Baghdadi commanders against Sulayman's officer Muhammad ibn Aws quickly escalated into a spate of violent clashes in 869. In 870 al-Husayn is mentioned as overseeing the seasonal festival (mawsim) during the pilgrimage of that year. He later held the office of chief of security (shurta) of Baghdad on behalf of Muhammad ibn Tahir in 885, during which time he protected a local monastery from being destroyed by a mob.

In 2016, Fader was the inaugural winner of the L‚ÄôChaim Prize for Outstanding Christian Medical Missionary Service. Fader has worked in Kenya and Burundi. He serves as the assistant medical director for Kibuye Hope Hospital. With the 2016 L'Chaim Prize, Fader intends to build a new ward in the hospital, expand its current laboratories, and buy orthopedic equipment.  Early life and education  Jason Fader first discovered the missionary field when he was a child, when his parents were both medical missionaries. Fader graduated from The Rift Valley Academy in 1995, a school in Kenya for both local children and children whose parents are medical missionaries. The Rift Valley Academy was founded in 1906 and accommodates 10 children at a time. In 1999 he graduated from Calvin College where his wife, Heather also attended. Fader got his MD from Loyola Stritch School of Medicine in 2003 and did his general surgery residency at Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the time, Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital had 529 beds and was an independently run academic medical center. At Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital, the general surgery residency program director, Seth Wolk, worked to provide Fader with the extra training he would need to serve as a medical missionary in Africa. He created an individualized program which included an additional sixth year dedicated to training that would support him in Africa. The Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital allowed its students to spend a month of their general surgery residency in a rural United States location. Fader was able to spend this month at the Kijabe Hospital in Kenya, which was a medical missionary hospital.  Missionary work  While studying in Michigan, Fader and his wife met two other families at the Knox Presbyterian Church and together they formed a medical missionary team. After finishing his residency, Fader moved back to Kenya. He worked at the Tenwek Hospital in Bomet, Kenya, roughly 4 hours outside of Nairobi. The Tenwek Hospital, at the time, had 308 beds and served roughly 600,000 people in Kenya. The Tenwek hospital had three general surgeons, one orthopedic surgeon, and one gynecologist. Fader moved to Burundi in 2013. As of 2017, Burundi had 14 surgeons for 10 million people. In Burundi, Fader works as a clinical faculty member at the Hope Africa University's Medical School. In addition to working as a teacher, Fader also serves as the assistant medical director at Kibuye Hope Hospital. Both Hope Africa University and the Kibuye Hope Hospital are located outside of Bujumbura (Burundi's largest city and former capital). Fader has been working to train doctors, perform surgeries, and upgrade and expand medical facilities. Each missionary with Fader is tasked with raising individual financial support and is required to speak both French and Kirundi.  L'Chaim Prize for Outstanding Medical Missionary Service  The L'Chaim Prize for Outstanding Medical Missionary Service was founded by Jewish philanthropist and businessman, Marc Gerson and his wife Erica Gerson, a rabbi. The L'Chaim Prize is a $500,000 grant aimed to award medical missionaries for their service and help them fund their mission. The African Mission Healthcare Foundation (AMHF) oversees the award and it is the largest ever monetary award for clinical care. Fader intended to use the prize money to build a new ward in the Kibuye Hope Hospital, buy orthopedic equipment for surgeries, and expand laboratories at the Hope Africa University Medical School. He also intended to create Burundi's first ever medical internship program and build additional housing for medical staff. The award would add 48 new beds to the existing 172-bed Kibuye Hope Hospital. In 2015, the Kibuye Hope Hospital had a total operating budget of $526,000, which is almost the same price as the overall L'Chaim Prize. In 2015, the hospital took care of 25,000 outpatients, 10,000 inpatients, 1,200 surgeries, and 800 cataract cases.

It was opened in the district of Oliwa in 1954 and covers 123,76 hectares, which makes it the largest zoological garden in Poland in terms of area. The zoo is a member of both the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). History Since 1927, until the outbreak of World War II, a menagerie had existed in Oliwa, which housed animals like brown bears, wild boars, giraffes, monkeys, wolves and raccoons. The official ceremony of the opening of the zoo took place on 1 May 1954 in the Le≈õny M≈Çyn Valley on the site of a former sanatorium that had existed there since 1945 and specialized in treating upper respiratory tract infections and rheumatic disorders. The dynamic development of the zoo in the 1950s and 1960s was made possible by the efforts of its first director Micha≈Ç Massalski. In the 1980s, the zoo was home to 800 animals representing 176 species. The zoo is renowned around the world for its collection of Andean condors and a highly successful breeding program of this bird species. In 2008, the giraffes' pavilion was constructed and currently houses 4 Rothschild's giraffes. In the same year, a leopard and meerkats were transferred to the Gda≈Ñsk Zoo. In 2009, the zoo acquired its first takin, and in 2014 four lions thought to be of Southwest African origin. The zoo is also a member of the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP). Since 2005, as the only zoological garden in Poland, it houses anoas and Javan lutungs. Among the rare species of animals that can be seen in the zoo are: scimitar oryxes, pygmy hippopotamuses, jackass penguins, bongos, Bali mynas, mandrills, yellow anacondas, Visayan spotted deer, takins, southern ground hornbills and Siberian tigers.

She later became one of U of T's first two female associate professors. Trained in physical chemistry, she switched focus to biochemistry when lack of job opportunities for female chemists led her to take a position teaching food chemistry as part of U of T's Domestic Science program. She also played a large role in the development of U of T's women's athletics program.  Early life and education  Clara Cynthia Benson was born in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada June 5, 1875 to Thomas Moore Benson and Laura Abigail Fuller. Laura and Thomas, a widowed businessman, lawyer, and judge, had three children together and additionally raised two daughters from Thomas' first marriage. Clara attended Port Hope High School then entered University College of the University of Toronto (U of T) in 1895 to study chemistry, mathematics and physics. This was only one year after the school began admitting women, and women were still not allowed into the school's reading rooms and were denied access to the library catalogues. Benson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from U of T in 1899 (the first woman to do so) and continued straight into PhD studies. She earned her doctorate in 1903, making her one of the first two women to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto (U of T) (the other being philosophy student Emma Baker). Benson's doctoral research, supervised by William Lash Miller, examined reaction rates of inorganic salt solutions. Her thesis, The rates of the reactions in solutions containing ferrous sulphate, potassium iodide, and chromic acid was published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry (JPC) in May, 1903.  Career and research  Benson's early research was in the field of physical chemistry, with an emphasis on reaction rates of inorganic salt solutions. Her 1902 article \\"The Rate of Oxidation of Ferrous Salts by Chromic Acid\\" may make her the second female author (after Marie Curie) to publish in the Journal of Physical Chemistry (JPC). As a woman, she had difficulty finding a job as a physical chemist after graduating, so she took a position as a demonstrator in food science at U of T's new Lillian Massey School of Domestic Science. She objected to this program's goal of preparing women to be housewives and had even signed a petition organized by University College's Women's Alumnae Association in 1902 questioning the program's introduction. At the time, however, food chemistry was one of the chemistry sub-fields with better professional opportunities for women. This position involved switching from U of T's Chemistry Department to their Physiology (Physiological Chemistry) Department, where she was mentored by the \\"Father of the Medical School at Toronto,\\" A.B. Macallum. Her subsequent research included biochemical examinations of fluid and tissue composition. When food science was incorporated into U of T's medical curriculum in 1905, Benson was promoted to lecturer in physiological chemistry (biochemistry), making her the first woman at U of T to achieve a rank above demonstrator. In 1906, a royal commission report led to the creation of the Faculty of Household Science, of which Benson and the principal, Annie Laird, became associate professors, making them U of T's first female professors. Benson helped develop the school's food chemistry program and, in 1926, was promoted to full professor and head of the Department of Food Chemistry (a position she held until her retirement as professor emeritus in 1945). Starting in 1915, she conducted summer studies at St. Andrews Biological Station examining the chemistry of seafood. At the request of Canada's Ministry of Marine and Fisheries, which was trying to build consumer demand for fish, she organized a group of food scientists from Canadian universities to work to improve fish preparation methods. During World War I she developed and organized a course of instruction on ways to adapt food chemistry analysis techniques to explosives. These methods were adopted by munitions laboratories, helping standardized their production steps. She was sole female founder of the American Society for Biological Chemistry (now the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB)) when it formed in December, 1906.  Other interests and later life  Benson advocated for the development of women's athletics at the University of Toronto, co-chairing a committee on the matter and serving as the first president of the Women's Athletic Association from 1921 until her retirement. She sat on a committee of female faculty members formed in 1928 to fight for the creation of a women's athletic facility. When U of T opened their first women's gymnasium in 1959, they named it the Benson Building in her honor. Benson served on the national board of the YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association), chairing their Foreign Committee, and her work with the organization led her to sponsor two French World War II orphans after her retirement. Her hobbies included stamp-collecting and traveling. She also enjoyed film-making, and videos she took while on some of her travels are housed at U of T's archives. She was colleagues and friends with biochemist Maud Menten, who was also trained by Archibald Macallum. Benson never married nor had children, and after retiring in 1945, she returned to Port Hope where she died March 24, 1964 (aged 89).  Honors and awards  Benson was elected a fellow of the Canadian Institute of Chemistry in 1919, but was not allowed to attend their Annual Dinner in 1920 because she was a woman. She was listed in the 1920s' American Men in Science. U of T's Household Science alumnae created a fellowship in her honor in 1950 and hung a portrait of her by Yousef Karsh in the Household Science building. In 1992, the Canadian Society of Chemistry created the annually-awarded Clara Benson Award to honor female chemists working in Canada. In 2003, U of T celebrated the 100 year anniversary of her PhD achievement with a day of celebrations including a reenactment of her thesis defense.

The depot was built to provide steam engines for services leaving station (originally Market Street) and freight traffic from the Valley Road area of the city. It was also responsible for other sites at Keighley and Ilkley (known as sub-sheds) with Manningham itself being a sub-shed of Holbeck. During its ownership by British Rail, diesel multiple units were based there along with diesel shunters. The shed was closed in 1967. History The first railway to reach Bradford in 1846 extended westwards up the Aire Valley from Leeds before turning south at Shipley and running along the flat ground of Bradford Dale before terminating at what was Market Street station (now ). Whilst a depot was established next to Market Street station (being operational by September 1846), the main depot at Manningham was opened on an enlarged site in 1872 due to the previous site becoming too cramped for its increasing use. Even though a turntable was installed at Manningham, a turntable was retained at Market Street (which itself was replaced by a hydraulic turntable in 1938). By 1938, a newer and longer turntable () had been installed at Manningham. It was originally given the code of 29 under the Midland Railway, which was changed to 20E under the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1935, a code that British Railways (BR) kept in their system in 1950. Manningham had always been a sub-shed of Holbeck (which was coded either as 20A or 55A, with the A denoting that it was the main shed). Manningham moved to 55F (still as a sub-shed of Leeds Holbeck) in 1957 when the depot was transferred from the London Midland Region of British Rail to the North Eastern Region. Manningham itself had sub-sheds at Ilkley and Keighley, with Keighley being transferred away to Skipton in 1935. Keighley was returned to Manningham in 1959. The depot at Manningham was immediately to the east of railway station and included a roundhouse with access/egress facing towards Bradford. There was also a four-road wooden shed which was demolished in the 1930s, but its lines and ash pits were retained. In 1959, DMUs were allocated to the depot to work the local services out of Forster Square. A fuelling point for diesels was not installed immediately and the DMUs had to travel to Bradford's Hammerton Street depot on the east of the city via the Shipley and Windhill line to refuel until sufficient facilities were provided at Manningham. Allocations In 1933, the allocation at the depot ran to 68 steam locomotives being drawn from Midland Railway types with a small selection of Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway engines (L&YR; Class 5 and L&YR; Class 27). In 1950, the depot had 45 locomotives assigned to it drawn from various types including BR, LMS and Lancashire & Yorkshire. By 1955 it had 32 steam locomotives, 25 in 1959 and 21 by 1962, though this included 4 Class 08 diesel shunters. In November 1966, some 5 months before closure, the depot had three Class 03 shunters, five LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T steam locomotives and six LMS Ivatt Class 4 steam locomotives. Closure The depot was closed at midnight on 29 April 1967, with most steam locomotives being transferred to the depot at Low Moor on the south side of Bradford. Steam was withdrawn from the Bradford area by 1 October of the same year. The DMUs had been transferred away to Bradford's Hammerton Street depot eight weeks before the closure of the depot. The site of the depot is now covered with light industrial units.

A number of guns were also converted to railway guns during World War I in order to meet a need for heavy artillery. Design The Canon de 24 C mod√®le 1876 were typical built-up guns of the period with mixed construction consisting of a rifled steel liner and several layers of iron reinforcing hoops. In French service guns of mixed steel/iron construction were designated in centimeters while all steel guns were designated in millimeters. However, reference materials do not always distinguish the difference in construction and use either unit of measurement. The guns used a de Bange breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The mle 1876 was mounted on a number of different models of garrison mounts with limited traverse. One exception was the GPC mount (c√¥te sur aff√ªt type Guerre √† Pivot Central) which was a rectangular steel firing platform which sat on top of a large circular steel track embedded in concrete behind a parapet. A rectangular steel firing platform with four wheels rotated on the track and gave 360¬∞ of traverse. The recoil system for the mle 1876 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. Railway guns In order to address a need for heavy artillery a number of mle 1876 guns were converted to railway guns and given the designation 24 cm Canon G mod√®le 1916. The conversion entailed removing the gun cradle from its carriage and mounting it on a variety of flatbed rail wagons built from steel I beams and timbers on top of a two, three or four-axle rail bogie. The gun carriage changed from an inclined hydro-gravity system to a horizontal hydro-spring system where the recoil was absorbed by a hydraulic buffer and returned to firing position by springs. At the front of the carriage there was also an attachment for an earth anchor and between the axles there were screw jacks which could be lowered to take weight off the axles and anchor the carriage. Elevation stayed the same but there was no traverse. The guns either had to be removed from the tracks and put on a wooden firing platform and levered into place or drawn across a section of curved track to aim. Beginning in 1916 twenty-four guns were assigned to French artillery units, thirteen were assigned to French training units and sixteen were assigned to artillery units of the US Army. Siege artillery In addition to its coastal artillery role, an unknown number of guns were used as siege artillery during the First World War.

The actor was contacted by his agent and the head of drama at Seven Network about the role. After hearing their pitch, Stewart auditioned and won the part. He began filming in December 2015, and made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2016. Justin was introduced to the show along with his three siblings; Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee), Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood) and Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger). The family received immediate comparisons to the show's popular Braxton brothers. Justin is portrayed as an impulsive, aggressive, \\"all-round typical Aussie bloke\\". He takes his role as head of the family seriously and is very protective of his siblings. The character's early storylines saw him clash with Martin Ashford (George Mason) and help save the life of Summer Bay stalwart Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). The Morgans are soon revealed to be in witness protection, following the murders of their parents by a drugs syndicate, who start targeting the siblings. The storyline saw the family held hostage, threatened, and involved in a plane crash. Justin is later shot at and stabbed by corrupt police officer Ranae Turner (Sacha Horler). During the witness protection storyline, Justin is reunited with his daughter Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas), and he develops a relationship with Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo), to whom he later becomes engaged. Following Giovinazzo's decision to leave the show, the couple break up when Phoebe leaves to pursue her music career in the United States. The character is then involved in an on/off relationship with Scarlett Snow (Tania Nolan). Later storylines have seen Justin begin a relationship with Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts), endure Ava's kidnapping, and targeted in a revenge campaign by Ebony Harding (Cariba Heine). For his portrayal of Justin, Stewart received a nomination for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. The character was branded \\"the Morgan trouble magnet\\" by a critic for Soaplife. Casting On 5 December 2015, Jonathon Moran from The Daily Telegraph reported that James Stewart had joined the cast of Home and Away as Justin Morgan, alongside actors Jackson Heywood and Orpheus Pledger who play his brothers Brody and Mason Morgan respectively. All three began filming their first scenes during the following week, ahead of their on-screen debut in 2016. Stewart was contacted by his agent and Julie McGauran, the head of drama at Seven Network, about a role in the show. After hearing the pitch, Stewart accepted the audition. Home and Away marks Stewart's second television appearance since he took time away from acting to be a stay-at-home dad. He commented, \\"I got to the end of three years of raising my daughter and just thought, 'Oh, I need to work. I've got to get her through school.'\\" New Zealand actor Benedict Wall also auditioned for the role of Justin, before he was later cast as Duncan Stewart. Stewart made his first appearance as Justin on 7 June 2016, alongside Heywood and Pledger. Development =Characterisation= Ahead of his screen debut, Stewart said his character's biggest strengths are \\"his love for his family and the lengths he'll go to, to protect them from their past.\\" He also described Justin as being \\"impulsive and aggressive\\", and having an \\"alpha mentality\\". Justin is a mechanic and an \\"all-round typical Aussie bloke\\" who enjoys sports and \\"a good laugh.\\" Stewart insisted that Justin was not a \\"bad boy\\" character, as had been suggested by various articles about the Morgans. He also joked that Justin likes to think he is good with women. Justin takes his role as the head of the family \\"very seriously\\". Along with Tori, he helped raise their younger brothers Brody and Mason. As a result he is \\"fiercely protective of them.\\" Stewart explained that Justin makes all the decisions on behalf of the family, but he often discusses them with Tori. Justin does not want to get too settled in the Bay, and he worries what the town's residents will think of his family. Stewart liked being part of a family and compared it to his role on Packed to the Rafters, where he was \\"an outsider brought in.\\" He also found that as the older brother and not the father, there were different dynamics at play. Stewart told Vanessa Williams of The West Australian that he fell in love with the Morgans from the moment they were pitched to him. The Morgan brothers drew immediate comparisons to the show's Braxton brothers, who were introduced in 2011. Stewart commented, \\"Creating this family is probably more our priority than taking over the Brax boys. How do you take on Steve Peacocke (Brax)? I hope Australia is ready for it, it is the way it is.\\" Heywood thought the Morgans had \\"a very different dynamic\\" to the Braxtons. Stewart agreed, saying that the families were \\"from completely different worlds\\". =Introduction= Justin bonds with and later helps save the life of Alf Stewart, played by Ray Meagher (pictured). Justin is driving his brothers to Summer Bay to meet up with their sister Tori, when they are almost involved in a car crash with Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (George Mason), who swerves across the road. Neither Justin or Ash are willing to back down when they come face to face. Mason admitted that Ash knows he is in the wrong, but he thinks Justin is \\"a hothead\\". Brody and Mason stop Justin and Ash from getting into a physical fight, and the brothers continue their journey to the Bay, where they later come across Tori talking with Ash and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) on the beach. Before another fight between Justin and Ash breaks out, Tori defuses the situation by revealing that Justin, Brody and Mason are her brothers. Justin is glad that his family made it to the Bay safely. Stewart told Stephen Downie of TV Week, \\"It's not so much that Justin is angry at Ash because he was an idiot. It's that he almost killed the one thing he's been trying to look after.\\" Tori warns Justin about his run in with Ash and they wonder if they will be able to stay in their new home this time. Tori secures Justin a job as a deck hand with Alf. Justin is initially annoyed that his sister interfered in his life, but when he gets out on Alf's boat, The Blaxland, he eventually sees that the job is a good opportunity for him. Stewart commented, \\"Justin is reluctant to go on the boat with Alf in the first place. But once he's there, he does start to enjoy it.\\" Justin bonds with Alf over their shared love of the water and the fact they each have \\"bossy\\" sisters. While they are out on the water, the boat breaks down and Justin struggles to fix it. Alf then starts having chest pains and he collapses when he suffers a heart attack. When he realises there is no phone signal, Justin jumps in the water and swims to the shore to fetch help. Stewart called his character \\"an accidental hero\\". =Witness protection secret= Upon their introduction, an Inside Soap columnist stated that the Morgans appeared to live a normal life, but they had \\"a dangerous past\\" and no one was allowed to know who they really were. The family initially keep to themselves, and Justin warns Tori against befriending local doctor Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor). He is worried when she admits to telling Nate that their parents are dead, as he does not want Nate looking into it. Stewart explained, \\"There are a set of rules the Morgans have to live by, which relate to their secret. If Justin has to live by them, then so does the rest of the house.\\" When Mason's former girlfriend Lara Adams (Elle Harris) visits him, Justin asks her to leave. But when she returns, Mason tells her that his family are in witness protection. Brody later reveals that he is being followed, and when Mason says that he spoke to Lara, Justin feels that the family need to leave the Bay. Guest character Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery) was soon introduced to the storyline. He drugs Nate, before going to the Morgan's house and threatening Tori. Justin arrives home soon after and Tori worries that he might put them in more danger, as she knows he is \\"a hothead.\\" McNamee commented, \\"she's trying to keep Justin calm and make sure he doesn't do anything irrational to escalate the situation.\\" The family are soon moved to a safe house by their police liaison officer Atticus Decker (John Adam). They agree that they are tired of running from the drugs syndicate who killed their parents. While Brody, Justin and Tori are arguing, Mason leaves the house to meet Lara, who has been working for Spike and Blaine Varden (Ashley Lyons), the man who killed the siblings' parents. Spike and Blaine trick Mason into telling them the location of the safe house and they hold the family hostage at gunpoint. As Blaine threatens to kill them, he reveals that Justin played a part in their parents' deaths. Spike later returns to the Bay to confront Justin about his father's book. He threatens both Justin and Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo), warning them that the Morgans will die. Stewart explained to Ali Cromarty of TV Week that Justin was \\"heavily involved\\" with his father's activities, but he has no idea what book Spike is talking about. Spike forces Justin and Phoebe to search through several boxes of the Morgan's belongings, and Justin worries about Phoebe's safety. Stewart stated, Justin knows he needs to get the precious cargo, Phoebe, out of the way. But, they both don't want to detach. She desperately wants to help Justin and Justin doesn't want to lose her.\\" Spike eventually leaves, but not before warning Justin that if he goes to the police, his family will be in danger. Justin and Phoebe continue looking through the boxes and they find a clue that helps them locate the book. The scriptwriters later devised a large stunt storyline involving a plane crash. Justin receives a warning from Spike that he has sabotaged the private plane Duncan Stewart (Benedict Wall) has chartered for Tori's birthday trip. Justin gets to the airport just as the flight takes off, and he attempts to chase it down the runway. Stewart spent most of the day filming the chase sequence, and it took nine times to get the scene right. Stewart said he had plenty of rest in between, as it took a long time to turn the plane back around. Justin breaks into the radio room and tries to contact Duncan. However, the passengers are passing out from carbon dioxide leaking into the cabin, and he struggles to get the coordinates. After receiving an incoherent response from Duncan, Justin contacts the police for backup. Stewart told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Justin initially thinks he can do it all by himself, but he soon realises he needs help. The actor also said, \\"Until he has an answer, there is always a moment of hope. But he's also prepared for the worst happening, too.\\" Duncan manages to crash land the plane in the bush, and everyone survives. Decker gives Justin an address for his nieces Hope (Jessica Falkholt) and Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble), who are unsure why their uncle sent Justin to their house. They are then set upon by Spike and his associates, who attempt to kidnap Hope and Raffy. Constable Kat Chapman (Pia Miller) and Ash, who have followed Justin, manage to rescue Raffy, but Spike drives off with Hope. Kat allows Raffy to stay with her, as she has no one else. The Morgans later learn Raffy is Decker's daughter and their half- sister. Decker is later shot to death and Superintendent Ranae Turner (Sacha Horler) is assigned to their case. Both Justin and Kat are suspicious of her and they later learn that she is working for the drugs syndicate. Justin tells his family that they have to leave town quickly. When Kat comes to collect him, they are both shot at by Ranae, who then follows them through the town. Justin is captured when he returns home to collect a USB stick containing evidence against the syndicate. Ranae ties Justin up and she tells him that she ordered the hit on his father. Justin is \\"devastated\\" by the revelation and screams at Ranae to shoot him, but Kat soon arrives with back up. The Morgan's are targeted by corrupt police officer Ranae Turner, played by Sacha Horler (pictured). Ranae later escapes jail and stabs Justin. Ranae and the rest of the drugs syndicate go on trial for their various crimes. Justin gives evidence in court and the members are sentenced to jail. The Morgans \\"breathe a huge sigh of relief\\" as they realise that they are finally free of witness protection. They also decide to keep their assigned identities instead of returning to their old names. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy pointed out \\"sudden name changes might confuse fans...\\" Seven months after their arrival, the Morgan's witness protection secret is revealed to the rest of the Bay in the Coastal News. =Stabbing= The show's 2016 season finale concludes with Ranae stabbing Justin. Ranae manages to escape house arrest using her police contacts and plans to end the Morgans. She has Tori kidnapped and brought to her location. Ranae then makes a \\"sinister\\" call to Justin and he rushes off to save Tori. Both siblings are scared as Ranae threatens to kill them both, before going after Brody and Mason. McNamee stated, \\"This is high stakes for Tori and Justin ‚Äì the syndicate murdered their parents, and they're prepared to kill again.\\" Justin and Tori manages to free themselves and escape, but just when they think they are in the clear, Ranae emerges and stabs Justin in the stomach. Justin slumps to the ground, as Tori attempts to save him. When the show resumed in January 2017, Tori was seen calling an ambulance for Justin, as Ranae and her associates drive off. Justin is rushed to the hospital in a serious condition, as he has lost a lot of blood. Tori knows that he needs to go into surgery, but Nate is busy with another patient, so she realises that she will have to operate on her own brother. Producers then introduced new surgeon and Tori's former boyfriend, Riley Hawkins (Ryan O'Kane), to the storyline, as he steps in to perform the operation. As Justin recovers at home, Brody encourages Justin to show Phoebe how much he loves her, as their relationship is suffering. Justin prepares a meal for them and sets up a table in the garden, onto which he places a jewellery box. However, before Phoebe comes over, Justin starts to feel unwell and he collapses in the garden. Tori finds an unconscious Justin and calls him an ambulance. =Relationships= Phoebe Nicholson The character was given an immediate love interest in the form of established regular Phoebe Nicholson. While Justin is out walking the family dog Buddy, he meets and \\"sweet-talks\\" Phoebe. They then have a one-night stand. Stewart said that Justin falls for Phoebe, as she is \\"cool, fun and she's also super-attractive.\\" The pair's relationship is tested when Phoebe becomes involved in the Morgan's witness protection secret, and Justin's brother, Brody, becomes attracted to Phoebe. But Justin is sure that Phoebe feels that same way about him as he does about her. Stewart commented, \\"Phoebe keeps doing things that make him know she digs him.\\" Phoebe and Justin continue to spend time together. When Phoebe is feeling down after being carjacked, Justin helps to cheer her up by singing to her at Salt. Phoebe then joins Justin on stage to continue the song together. Of her character's attraction to Justin, Giovinazzo said, \\"Phoebe can't deny that she has strong and deep feelings for Justin. They're just drawn to each other.\\" The couple later share a kiss, and an Inside Soap columnist pointed out that they were \\"totally loved up.\\" However, as Justin and his family are being targeted by criminals, Giovinazzo said Phoebe had to be smart about the situation, which meant possibly putting their relationship on hold. Phoebe later admits to Justin that she is in love with him, but he finds that he cannot commit to her because of the threat against his family. Producers tested the relationship again by introducing Justin's estranged daughter Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas), who he had to give up when he went into witness protection. After Justin is reunited with Ava, he comes to Phoebe and \\"breaks down\\" after Ava's mother Nina Gilbert (Zoe Naylor) bans him from seeing her. Justin makes a \\"spontaneous\\" proposal of marriage to Phoebe, who reacts badly and questions whether they want different things in life. Phoebe also admits that she has been hurt by the break down of her parents' marriage. Justin makes it clear that he wants to be with her for the rest of his life. Stewart explained that Justin had not been in a relationship with one person for as long as he had been with Phoebe, and he likes that she gets along with his family. He also said that Justin has \\"never felt like this about a girl\\". Justin attempts to tell Phoebe how he feels and he makes a speech \\"from the heart\\", which causes her to change her mind and accept his proposal. When Giovinazzo decided to leave Home and Away, producers devised a break up for Phoebe and Justin. Phoebe's friend Donna Fields (Melissa Bonne) invites her to join a tour in the United States, and Justin plans to go with her. However, when he learns Brody is at the police station due to another incident involving his drug addiction, Justin realises he cannot leave the Bay. He and Phoebe say \\"a heartfelt goodbye\\" before she leaves. On her return, Phoebe tells Justin that she has been asked to take part in a year-long tour and Justin is determined to go with her this time. Shortly after, he is reunited with his daughter Ava and he finds the thought of leaving her again hard to deal with. Stewart told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that having Ava back in his life \\"means everything\\" to Justin, and when she calls him \\"dad\\" for the first time, it really affects him. During a farewell party for the couple, Justin sings a ballad for Ava, which makes Phoebe realise that she cannot separate them. Phoebe believes she and Justin can have a long-distance relationship, but Justin breaks up with her instead. Of the moment, Stewart commented \\"By the time Phoebe says she's going without him, Justin has come to terms with it in his heart. He doesn't want to anchor her ‚Äì so he sets her free.\\" Scarlett Snow In May 2017, producers introduced guest character Scarlett Snow (Tania Nolan) into Brody's drug addiction storyline. Scarlett also becomes a new love interest for Justin. After Scarlett is carjacked by Brody, she attempts to help him, along with the Morgans. When Scarlett becomes suspicious that Brody is still using, she searches his car and finds his stash of drugs. She and Justin confront Brody, who launches himself at Scarlett and Justin has to hold him back. Brody later steals money and jewellery from Scarlett. Various obstacles stop Scarlett and Justin from dating. Her estranged husband Caleb Snow (Josh McConville) sends a private investigator to find her, prompting Justin to get her out of the Bay for a while. Upon her return, Scarlett gets drunk as she struggles to deal with the anniversary of her son's death, leading Justin to walk her home. She \\"drunkenly flirts\\" with him and wakes up in his bed the following morning. Scarlett fears that she and Justin had a one-night stand, but Justin \\"embarrassingly\\" has to assure her that he just brought her back to his house to sleep off the alcohol. Justin grows closer to Scarlett, as she continues to help out with Brody. When she convinces him to sell his restaurant to fund a private rehab, Justin is \\"delighted\\" and makes his gratitude known. Scarlett then goes to kiss him, but Justin pulls away and asks her to leave. After spending the day together, the pair almost have sex. But Justin calls out Phoebe's name and then passes out on Scarlett's bed from too much alcohol. Scarlett later tells him that they should just be friends. Scarlett eventually agrees to go on a proper date with Justin, who organises a picnic on a remote beach in the Bay. Stewart explained that Justin is nervous, but he was also ready to go on the date. He continued, \\"After all their trials and tribulations, he's keen to start off on the right foot.\\" The date starts off well, and the couple spend time swimming in the water, however, Justin dives in for a last swim and fails to resurface. Stewart described the situation as \\"life-threatening\\". Scarlett pulls Justin from the water and starts to give him CPR, but it brings up memories of her attempt to revive her son. As Nolan's guest stint came to an end, producers implemented a break up for the couple. Scarlett spends time with her husband, leading Justin to realise that she is still in love with Caleb. Justin knows that their relationship cannot work and he refuses to be \\"the other man\\". Scarlett leaves the Bay with Caleb to work on their marriage, leaving Justin \\"heartbroken\\". Willow Harris In late 2017, a new love interest for the character was introduced in the form of Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts). The pair do not get off to a good start, as Willow attacks Justin. When she pulls up to the garage on a motorbike, Justin attempts to \\"charm her\\", but Willow hits him with her helmet and then ties him to a workbench. Willow demands Justin tells her where her money is, but he explains that he gave it to the police. Willow leaves him in the garage overnight, and returns in the morning to taunt him and explain that the money does not actually belong to her. She leaves when Ash and Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman) turn up for work. Johnathon Hughes of the Radio Times observed that Willow seemed to \\"have made an impression\\" on Justin, as he does not want to report her to the police. Willow then kidnaps Buddy. When Justin tracks her down, he stops her from getting beaten by Boyd Easton (Steve Le Marquand). Willow accuses him of making the situation worse. Hughes thought their meeting would lead to romance, saying \\"an attraction develops between them\\". After learning that Boyd has put Willow's father in the hospital, Justin decides to meet with him and his gang. Stewart told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Justin \\"is becoming quite protective of Willow.\\" Justin traps Boyd by recording their meeting and endures a beating in a bid to get evidence against him. Justin then reports Boyd to the police. Willow makes it clear that she is not grateful for his interference. Willow then moves to the Bay. Stewart commented that Justin is \\"thrilled\\" by the development, but he does not want Willow knowing that. Justin helps Willow gain employment at the local gym and as she is thanking him, they kiss. Willow and Justin have sex, but when he attempts to ask where their relationship is going, she throws him out of her caravan. Willow admits that she only wants a casual relationship, but she knows Justin wants more and they end up having sex again. As the storyline between their characters played out on-screen, Stewart and Roberts developed a relationship off-screen. Producers soon tested the relationship with the introduction of Willow's former boyfriend Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor). Dean is a member of the show's fictional criminal gang The River Boys, with which Willow also has connections. After a romantic meal at Salt, Willow and Justin return to her caravan to find a naked Dean in Willow's bed. After throwing him out, Willow explains that she and Dean are old friends and she did not know that he would be there, but Justin has his doubts about her explanation. The scriptwriters created further problems for the couple by reintroducing Justin's daughter, Ava. Willow is unaware Justin is a father, until Ava and her mother Nina arrive in the Bay. As Willow deals with the revelation, Nina \\"drops another bombshell\\" as she wants Justin to look after Ava for a month. Willow bonds with Ava, and Justin feels comfortable enough to leave them alone together. However, when he returns home he finds his daughter boiling water and using knives as she helps with dinner. Willow leaves due to Justin's \\"ferocious reaction\\" and tells Dean that she think Justin overreacted. Dean takes advantage of the rift between the couple, telling Willow that Justin does not respect her. When Justin apologises, Willow is \\"defensive\\" due to Dean's words. Writers devised a break up for the couple following Ava's kidnapping. Willow ends the relationship, so Nina will continue to let Justin have access to Ava. Roberts said her character is \\"devastated\\" about the break up. But instead of telling Justin why she ended things between them, Willow kisses Dean, so Justin will move on. Justin \\"is gutted\\" by the stunt and accepts the relationship is over. Roberts believed Willow was more suited to Justin, saying \\"She came to Summer Bay to straighten her life out, and Justin was a perfect match for that reason!\\" Weeks later, Dean informs Justin that Willow has a gambling problem and needs his help. Justin starts by booking Willow into a motel and staying with her. Willow goes into \\"full meltdown mode\\" when Justin prevents her from placing a bet on a winning horse. Willow then informs Justin that she started gambling because of him, so he asks Tori to speak with her. Leah Patterson In April 2019, writers established a casual relationship between Justin and Leah Patterson (Ada Nicodemou). The storyline begins with Leah offering her advice to Justin about his various family issues, before they end up kissing and spending the night together. The following day, they agree that it was just a bit of fun, but they soon have sex again. Nicodemou admitted that she was surprised by the development, as the characters had not had not shared many scenes or storylines, but she thought that it made sense. She explained, \\"Leah and Justin are a similar age and they're the ones who always seem to look after everyone else. But I think they've also both got to a stage in their lives where they need a friend to chat to and are ready to have a bit of fun.\\" Stewart agreed that they shared similarities, and he thought that it was an \\"obvious move\\" getting the two characters together. He also believed a moment from the previous year, in which a drunk Justin made a romantic advance towards Leah, was the producers' \\"testing the waters\\" for the relationship. =Daughter's kidnapping= Ebony Harding, played by Cariba Heine (pictured), gets revenge on those involved in her brother, Boyd's death. After Justin is forced to testify in court instead of taking Ava surfing, he wakes the following morning to find that she has gone missing. Justin is \\"panicked\\" by his daughter's disappearance and believes it is his fault. Stewart explained, \\"When Justin realises Ava is not in the house, he goes straight into panic mode. As any normal parent would, but the panic slowly increases, hour by hour.\\" As Justin goes to the police, Willow tries to reassure Justin that Ava has gone off on her own before, but he starts to \\"freak out\\". Justin soon receives a ransom demand of $25,000 for Ava's safe return. The family discuss paying the ransom without the involvement of the police, but Raffy worries about Justin's safety and goes to the police herself. As Justin meets with an older woman called Hazel (Genevieve Lemon), the police turn up and scare her off. Justin is \\"fuming\\" with Raffy. Willow soon realises that Hazel is Boyd Easton's mother and that Ava's kidnapping is her fault. The ransom exchange is reorganised and Willow accompanies Justin, along with Dean and Constable Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin). Willow gives Boyd the money and Ava is returned to Justin. However, Dean fights with Boyd, who then drives his car at Dean. Colby shoots Boyd and he dies in the hospital. Hazel and her daughter Ebony Harding (Cariba Heine) vow revenge on everyone who played a part in Boyd's death. When Nina returns to the Bay, she demands to know why Ava was kidnapped. Justin attempts to explain, but a \\"furious\\" Nina decides to take Ava home and tells Justin that he is an unfit father. The incident eventually leads to Justin and Willow's break up, as Nina tells her that if they are together, then Justin cannot see Ava. Meanwhile, Ebony focuses the first stage of her revenge campaign on Justin. Ebony brings her car to Summer Bay Auto to be fixed, and notices that Dean and Ziggy are the only two employees present. Upon her return, she forces Ziggy into handing over the car before Justin has signed off on the work. Ebony then stages an accident by crashing her car into a tree and cutting the brakes. As she is taken to hospital, Ebony makes it known to the police that she blames the garage for being \\"careless\\". An inspector from fair trading closes the garage as an investigation into their work practices takes place. Ebony blackmails Justin into paying her $30,000 to keep the case out of court. She also accepts a job as a waitress at his brother's restaurant. Reception For his portrayal of Justin, Stewart was nominated for Best Actor at the Digital Spy Reader Awards; he received 1% of the total vote. He was longlisted for Best Daytime Star at the 2017 Inside Soap Awards. The following year, Justin and Willow received a nomination for Best Soap Couple at the Digital Spy Reader Awards; they came in last place with 1% of the total vote. Ali Cromarty and Stephen Downie of TV Week were impressed by the new brothers, commenting, \\"Move over Braxtons, there's a new family of hot brothers in Summer Bay.\\" They also branded them \\"loyal, caring and hard- working\\". Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy dubbed the Morgans \\"Summer Bay's unluckiest family\\". He later included their witness protection storyline in his list of \\"soap storylines past their sell-by dates\\". Kilkelly reiterated that the Morgans were \\"the unluckiest family in Summer Bay history\\". He bemoaned the constant stream of villains that arrived in the Bay and the dangerous situations the family found themselves in. Kilkelly added, \\"Seriously, Summer Bay bosses, make it stop! Either kill the lot of them off, or let them go at least a week without being kidnapped or shot at...\\" When Justin survived being stabbed, Kilkelly commented that he proved \\"his resilience yet again\\". A South Wales Echo reporter criticised Justin's actions before his collapse, stating \\"If you're on the mend and planning a romantic dinner, don't rush things or you could jeopardise your recuperation. That's a lesson Justin could do with learning as he romances Phoebe this week. The poor bloke's only gone and got a post-operative infection\\". Claire Crick from Soaplife branded the character \\"the Morgan trouble magnet\\". Crick later dubbed Justin \\"something of a knight in shining armour.\\" Justin's romantic relationships have attracted commentary from critics. A writer for TV Week noted, \\"They're on. They're off. It's hard to keep up with Justin and Phoebe's relationship.\\" Ali Cromarty of the same publication observed \\"ever since they first locked eyes, the chemistry between Justin and Phoebe has been palpable.\\" Of Phoebe's temporary departure, a New Idea columnist commented \\"It may be just for a week, but things have a tendency of falling apart for these two lovebirds faster than you can say 'flamin' galah'!\\" Johnathon Hughes of the Radio Times thought \\"the chemistry is evident\\" between Justin and Scarlett, and added \\"surely it can't be long before they end up in bed for real?\\" When the couple went on their first date, Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis said \\"it's about time! The pair have been dancing around their feelings for each other for weeks, leaving us shouting at our screens in frustration.\\" A writer for TVNZ listed seven reasons why the characters should be together, stating \\"They could be Home and Away's new golden couple, if they'd both just get over themselves and admit it.\\" The reasons included their attraction to one another, their shared interests, and their initial dislike of each other, which the writer said was a \\"classic giveaway\\". They added that Justin and Scarlett would \\"make a beautiful couple.\\" References External links *Justin Morgan at the Official Home and Away website *Justin Morgan at TVNZ Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 2016 Fictional mechanics Fictional orphans Fictional victims of kidnapping Male characters in television ","title":"Justin Morgan (Home and Away)"},{"id":"58436107","text":"Iaroslav Denysenko (Yaroslav Yuriyovych Denysenko, , born 23 September 1991) is a swimmer from Ukraine who competes in Paralympic S13, SB13 and SM13 (individual medley) events.

It is a Grade I listed building. Originally constructed in the late 16th century, the house has been remodelled several times since. It is built in red brick with stone dressings and a slate roof, originally to an H-shaped plan, but since infilled at the front. Originally a two-storey building, it is now a three-storey building with a 7-bay frontage. The central 5 bays project slightly and have a 3-window polygonal bay. The Hall stands within an associated park, whose features include a walled garden and the Carnaby Temple folly (known locally as the Pepperpot). Other buildings, such as the Dairy, the Pigeon House and the Lodge, are Grade II listed buildings. History The house was acquired in 1549 by William Strickland of Marske, who extended it into an H-shaped building with a central hall. Strickland was reputed to have sailed to America with Sebastian Cabot and to have introduced the turkey to England and was twice MP for Scarborough. It passed down to his grandson, the Parliamentarian Sir William Strickland, 1st Baronet who was MP for Hedon in the Long Parliament from 1640 to 1653. It descended via Sir William Strickland, 3rd Baronet, MP to Sir William Strickland, 4th Baronet, MP, who commissioned both Lord Burlington and William Kent to carry out work on the Hall. Further modifications were done by the 4th Baronet in 1684. In the 1720 an extra floor was added with a new slate roof and in the 1760s the front of the house was infilled by the York architect John Carr. The 7th Baronet changed his name to Cholmley in 1865 in order to inherit the estates, including Howsham Hall, of Nathaniel Cholmley, but his son Sir Charles Strickland, 8th Baronet reverted to the traditional surname. The direct Strickland line failed in 1938 on the death of Sir Walter Strickland, 9th Baronet (who had renounced the title and left the country) and the Hall passed to the Strickland-Constable branch of the family. They sold it in the 1950s. The house was then bought back in the 1980s by a family member, Richard Marriott, and has since been restored.

The festival and accompanying rituals are celebrated to honor the spirit deity Agemo, who is believed to be a protector of children and who safeguards Ijebus future through its blessing. The festival is linked with the traditional African religion, in particular, the practices of the Agemo cult and as such, issues like restriction of movement during certain periods of the festival do occur. Festival The festival is mostly celebrated during between the months of June and August, and historically coincided with the harvesting of maize by Ijebu farmers. The period of the festival takes seven days and the beginning period is fixed after a consultative meeting between the Awujale of Ijebu and the heads of the sixteen recognized or titled agemos also called Olofas. The festival was historically preceded by seven days of chants by the Oro cult and the beating of drums to 'gbedu' music. Thereafter, sixteen agemo masquerades from different villages proceed to their shrine at Imosan, via Ijebu-Ode on an annual pilgrimage. Each agemo carries items such as feathers and ram's horns on the head and are followed by some agemo followers. It is considered a taboo for a woman to see the agemo masquerade during their procession to Imosan. On their pilgrimage, the agemo masquerade stops to receive gifts and offer prayers to residents. At Imosan, the masquerades receive additional gifts sent by the Awujale, they spend three days at the Agemo shrine performing traditional religious rites and appeasement of the agemo deity. On their last day at Imosan, a traditional agemo ritual dance is performed this time, it can be witnessed by both men and women. The masquerades will then move to Ijebu-Ode to perform the final rites of the festival. The festival ends with the dance by the leader of the agemo, 'Tami Onire' before the Awujale and further public dances by the other agemos. The agemo festival is an old ritual performance among the Ijebus, historically, the agemo priests were part of the intellectual life of Ijebu and over the years, conflicting ideas about how many titled agemos are recognized or how the rituals should be performed emerged. Though, many recognize 16 agemo titles, there exist more, while the Awujale's in modern times are either Muslims or Christians and doesn‚Äôt stop them from fulfilling many historical roles.

Khan is an American scholar specializing in antitrust and competition law in the United States. She currently serves as an Associate Professor of Law at Columbia Law School.  Early life and education  Khan was born in London to Pakistani parents and moved with them to the United States when she was 11 years old. She graduated from Williams College in 2010 where she wrote her thesis on Hannah Arendt. She was also the editor of the student newspaper at Williams. After graduating she went to work at the New America Foundation, where she did anti-monopoly research and writing for the Open Markets Program. She received her JD from Yale University in 2017.  Amazon's Antitrust Paradox  While still a law student at Yale University, she became a public figure in 2017 when her article in the Yale Law Journal, Amazon's Antitrust Paradox, made a significant impact in American legal and business circles. The New York Times described it as \\"reframing decades of monopoly law\\". In the article, Khan argued that the current American antitrust law framework, which focuses on keeping consumer prices down, cannot account for the anticompetitive effects of platform-based business models such as that of Amazon. She proposed alternative approaches for doing so: \\"restoring traditional antitrust and competition policy principles or applying common carrier obligations and duties.\\"  Career  Khan researched and published on market consolidation issues at the New America Foundation until 2014, when she began law school at Yale. While at Yale, Khan was a co-student director of Yale's Mortgage Foreclosure Litigation Clinic, where she represented homeowners who were being improperly foreclosed on by financial institutions. She also spent a summer working at Gupta Wessler, a firm specializing in public interest and plaintiff-side appellate litigation. After completing her studies, Khan worked as legal director at the Open Markets Institute, which was spun off from New America after Khan and her team criticized Google's market power, prompting pressure from Google, which was a funder of New America. During her time at OMI, Khan met with Senator Elizabeth Warren to discuss anti-monopolistic policy ideas. In 2018, Khan worked as a Legal Fellow at the Federal Trade Commission in the office of Commissioner Rohit Chopra. Khan joined Columbia Law School as an academic fellow, where she pursued research and scholarship on antitrust law and competition policy, especially relating to digital platforms. She published The Separation of Platforms and Commerce in the Columbia Law Review, making the case for structural separations that prohibit dominant intermediaries from entering lines of business that place them in direct competition with the businesses dependent on their networks. In 2019, Khan began serving as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, where she has been leading the congressional investigation into digital markets. In July 2020, Columbia Law School Dean Gillian Lester announced that Khan would be joining the school's faculty as an Associate Professor of Law.  Awards and recognition  For Amazon's Antitrust Paradox, Khan won the Antitrust Writing Award for \\"Best Academic Unilateral Conduct Article\\" in 2018, the Israel H. Peres Prize by Yale Law School, and the Michael Egger Prize from the Yale Law Journal. In 2018 Politico named Khan to the Politico 50, its list of thinkers whose ideas are driving politics, describing Khan as \\"a leader of a new school of antitrust thought.\\" Khan has also been named to Foreign Policy's \\"Global Thinkers,\\" The Prospect's \\"Top 50 Thinkers,\\" the WIRED25, the National Journal 50, Washingtonian's list of most influential women, and Time's \\"Next Generation Leaders.\\" Khan's scholarship has attracted significant public attention around the world.

Early life and education  Bakhtian was inspired by Han Solo and The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet as a child. She attended the Canterbury School in Fort Myers, Florida. She completed her bachelor's degree at Duke University, where she was a Pratt research fellow. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in mechanical engineering and physics. She completed her master's degrees at Stanford University and the University of Cambridge, where she was a Churchill Scholar. At Cambridge she worked on unmanned aerial vehicles using a wind tunnel. Bakhtian earned her doctorate at Stanford University in the department of Aeronautical and Astronautical engineering. She worked with Juan J. Alonso of Stanford and Michael J. Aftosmis Ames Research Center. Her thesis was in the field of supersonic retropropulsion, that is using thrusters to slow objects moving faster than the speed of sound. Bakhtian explored using such thrusters to change the shape of the leading bow shock so as to increase the decelerative drag force. Such technology may one enable landing objects of higher-mass on the surface of Mars, or other objects with a low-density atmosphere. Whilst at Stanford University she attended a course on science policy and became interested in the intersection of government and academia. She was made a Phi Beta Kappa Elizabeth Buttler Reed Scholar. The Space Shuttle had shut down and there was discussion that NASA would not be involved with the International Space Station. She was awarded a Zonta International Amelia Earhart Fellowship in 2011 and spoke regularly on behalf of the NASA speakers bureau. She completed her thesis, Drag Augmentation via Supersonic Retropropulsion for Atmospheric Deceleration, in 2012.

At an early age Canon's family moved out of Bi√±an and transferred to Cabildo street in Intramuros. Canon studied at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and subsequently moved to Spain where Canon pursued his medical studies at the Universidad Central De Madrid, now the Complutense University of Madrid. While in Spain Canon met Teresa Batlle, who later became his wife. Being a childhood friend of Jose Rizal, the two maintained a correspondence; their letters are in possession of Canon's granddaughter Maria Teresa Canon Garcia, the custodian of his momentos. Like Rizal, Canon was a polyglot speaking six languages: French, Spanish, Filipino, German, English, and Italian. Canon and his wife brought the first copies of theNoli Me Tangere into the Philippines. Canon served as a cabinet member of the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines as Secretary of Welfare and Director-General of Public Works. In the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Canon served as a General in Nueva Vizcaya.Canon, Fernando. (2015). In V. Almario (Ed.), Sagisag Kultura (Vol 1). Manila: National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Retrieved from https://philippineculturaleducation.com.ph/canon-fernando/ He was exiled to Spain where he taught electrical and mechanical engineering and had a clinic. He refused to swear allegiance to the United States and rejected his pension as a veteran of the Philippine American War. Upon returning to the Philippines in late 1907 and taught at the Liceo de Manila, now Manila Central University. Canon died on July 18, 1938. Literary works The first published poem of Canon was under the pseudonym kuitib, it was the sonnet a las dalagas malolenses which appeared in 1889 in the newspaper La Solidaridad. This ode to the young women of Malolos, who had requested Spanish classes in the evening, allowed Canon to make a poem about hidden progress and changes: Gold, though covered by slag, emerges much brighter through fire The poem Flor ideal (‚ÄúIdeal Flower‚Äù) was published in the second issue of Cultura Filipina in May 1910 and later on it also appeared in the last pages of the book containing Canon's long poem A la Laguna de Bay. In the anthology Parnaso Filipino, published around 1923, Eduardo Mart√≠n de la C√°mara included two poems of his: ‚ÄúFlor ideal‚Äù y ‚ÄúRizal artista.‚Äù Two of Canon's poems dedicated to Rizal were part of the book Poes√≠as dedicadas a Jos√© Rizal by the 1961 Philippine National Centennial Commission. The essays of Canon: Cundiman, Kuriapi, Kawit, Fire-resistant roofs for light materials, Ohm‚Äôs Law, and Practical Memories appeared in Cultura Filipina, a monthly arts and science magazine in the Philippines, between 1910 and 1914. In Practical Memories, Canon remembers a beautiful vegetable garden that he discovered during his daily trips from Sarri√° (Spain) to Barcelona. This is an excerpt that shows Canon's style: The windmills quivered soundlessly at the slightest blow of breeze and drops or trickles of water gathered at the pond to be distributed, as dew, as cleaning or underground water with temperature and fertilizers that allow the early exuberant growth of small red radishes, artistically clustered here, and there minute cucumbers, now compact ivory lettuce, and in its season, the coveted succulent asparagus and even the ridged watercress... The memory of this orchard is a comparison that Canon uses to discuss the situation of cultivation and the use of land in the Philippines. In 1921 Fernando Canon published his narrative poem A la Laguna de Bay; the poem objectifies to show how Philippine esoteric knowledge and spirituality can intertwine with technology, philosophical thinking, and modernity. Other achievements Canon's inventions included improvements to electrotherapeutic devices, a soap for lepers, and a cane that doubled as a stun gun. Canon studied classical guitar with Francisco T√°rrega in Spain. He became the first secretary of the Conservatory of Music of the University of the Philippines when it was founded in 1916. He wrote an article on the kuriapi, a traditional Philippine string instrument that he also played. Canon was also a chess player. In 1905 Canon won the first Catalan Chess Championship held at the Sportmen's Club of Barcelona, and upon his return to the Philippines he won the first national chess championship in 1908. After winning the championship, there is no further record of Canon ever competing in another chess tournament.

Map of Turkmenistan with Afghanistan to the south-east Description The border starts at the tripoint with Iran on the Tedzhen river. Then proceeds eastwards in a series of mostly straight lines for about , until reaching the Kushk River near the Afghan town of Torghundi, which it follows southwards for a short section. It then proceeds across land for in a north-westwards direction until reaching the Murghab River, which it follows northwards for . It then continues across land north-westwards for , until reaching the Amu Darya river just to the north of the Afghan town of Khamyab. The border then follows the thalweg of this river up to the tripoint with Uzbekistan. The border traverses a thinly populated area consisting mostly of desert and some hills, except for the easternmost section where the Amu Darya is paralleled by a road and railway on the Turkmen side. History The border was inherited from the old Soviet Union-Afghan border, which largely took its current shape during the 19th century Anglo-Russian rivalry in Central Asia known as the Great Game. With the Russian Empire having conquered the Khanate of Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara, and with the British Empire controlling the British Raj, the two powers agreed to leave Afghanistan as an independent buffer state between them. In 1873 Britain and Russia agreed on a rough formulation of the border, with the Amu Darya declared to be the border going east from the vicinity of the village of Khwaja Salar to Lake Zorku, with the Wakhan Corridor to remain in Afghanistan. The western section of the border (i.e. the bulk of the modern Afghan-Turkmen boundary) was to be determined at a later date by a boundary commission. Tensions mounted as the Russians expanded further into what is now Turkmenistan in the early 1880s, reaching a crisis with the Panjdeh incident (near Sandykachi in what is now Turkmenistan), an area claimed by Afghanistan. Discussions calmed the situation and a joint Anglo-Russian boundary commission demarcated the boundary as it is today over the period 1885‚Äì88. As the village of Khwaja Salar could no longer be identified it was agreed that the boundary should meet the Amu Darya in the vicinity of Khamiab, Afghanistan. The easternmost section of the border (now forming part of the Afghan-Tajik boundary) was not finally delimited until 1893‚Äì95, with the Afghans agreeing to waive any claims to lands north the Amu Darya. This agreement also stipulated the position of the land border in section east of Lake Zorkul up to China, with a series of boundary pillars subsequently erected. In 1921 a Soviet-Afghan treaty was signed whereby Russia agreed \\"to hand over to Afghanistan the frontier districts which belonged to the latter in the last century, observing the principles of justice and self-determination of the population inhabiting the same.\\" However this treaty was never implemented, and was explicitly annulled by the Frontier Agreement of 1946, which kept the boundary as it was, with riverine islands to be subsequently allocated by a joint commission. In 1979 Soviet troops of the 40th Army crossed the border at Ymamnazar/Kushka as part of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, en route to Herat and Kandahar. There have been a number of incidents in recent years connected to the ongoing conflict and instability in Afghanistan, prompting Turkmenistan to increase its military presence on the frontier. In 2017 Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow personally visited the border to inspect security arrangements there. Incidents * There were several incidents along the border in 2014. In February Turkmen border guards killed a militant who crossed the border illegally and captured two others. In retaliation three Turkmen border guards were killed later that month. In May that year three Turkmen guards were killed by an armed group crossing the border from Ghormach District, Afghanistan. * In October 2015, several Taliban fighters were chased onto an island in the Amu Darya by Afghan forces, forcing Turkmenistan's border security to prevent them entering their territory. This incident occurred a few weeks after Turkmenistan strongly protested Kazakhstan's president Nursultan Nazarbayev expressing concern about the security situation along the Afghan-Turkmen frontier. * In 2017, four fighters believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State were apprehended crossing illegally into Turkmenistan.

First a sculptor, after the Second World War, Sartori began to fervently study the masks of Commedia dell'Arte which led him to a technique of modeling leather masks on wooden molds. His mask making techniques became famous, and his son Donato (1939 - 2016) later continued the work. Sartori became friends with Jacques Lecoq, who introduced him to the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, where he met Giorgio Strehler and Paolo Grassi. This was a turning point in Sartori's career, and brought him into contact with other artists such as Ferruccio Soleri and Marcello Moretti for the construction of masks for their theater productions. In 1979 his son Donato Sartori founded the Centro maschere e strutture gestuali in Padua, while in 2004, after his death, the Internation Museum of the Masks of Amleto and Donato Sartori (Museo Internazionale della Maschera Amleto e Donato Sartori) was founded in Abano Terme.

Synopsis Erase and Forget features interviews with Bo Gritz filmed over a ten-year period, alongside archival footage and images gleaned from the internet. Production and release Erase and Forget is a Danish-British co-production, which was supported by The Wapping Project Commissions with funding from Women's Playhouse Trust and Arts Council England. The executive producer was Gareth Evans. It was developed out of early collaboration with Vision Machine. Erase and Forget first screened at the 2017 Berlin Film Festival where it was nominated for the Glash√ºtte Original Documentary Award. It screened in October 2017 at the London Film Festival, played in UK cinemas from 2 March 2018 and was internationally screened on online viewing platform MUBI in July and August 2018. Critical reaction The Financial Times gave it 5 stars and wrote 'the film is so loopy you end up like Laoco√∂n, wreathed by serpents of paradox and contradiction.' Empire Magazine , Little White Lies, The Guardian and Frieze were some of the papers or magazines which connected the film to the presidency of Donald Trump and contemporary American politics, with Frieze describing it as 'a portrait of Gritz as a kind of cipher for evolving 20th century American ideologies' and Empire describing it as a 'disconcerting documentary, which also doubles as an insight into the American mindset that led to the election of Donald Trump. The film topped Sight and Sound's 'Five British Artists films' of 2018. There was some criticism around Gritz himself being a contentious character by the Times Kevin Maher, questioning the possible platform Gritz was given by this film. To this Zimmerman points out that she made the film precisely because of his contentious role in popular and military culture.

Eleanora Mary Carus-Wilson (1897 ‚Äì 1 February 1977) was a British economic historian. She is known for her work on rural Medieval textile industries in England. She made significant contributions to the understanding of Medieval technology in the region. Biography Carus-Wilson was born in Montreal, Canada. Mary Carus- Wilson was her mother.https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/P-MSS018/printable/&ved;=2ahUKEwiSqvnx7LLiAhVBTd8KHf1KAbYQFjABegQIBhAG&usg;=AOvVaw1UQaAavClG3LbP_1UqGzWn She grew up in London, England and attended St. Paul's Girls' School. She then went on to Westfield College where she graduated in 1921 with a bachelors and 1926 with a master's degree. She taught part-time at a boarding school for around 10 years until in 1936 she received a Leverhulme Scholarship so she could focus on research full-time. During World War II, she worked as a civil servant in Colwyn Bay, where she worked for the Ministry of Food. After the war, she returned to London to teach at the London School of Economics (LSE). At LSE, she was mentored by economic historian, Eileen Power. In 1948, Carus- Wilson was made a Reader and then went on to become a professor of economic history. She taught at LSE from 1953 until she retired on 1965. She was a Ford's lecturer at Oxford between 1964 and 1965, where she taught English history. Carus-Wilson also worked on creating a publishing program for the Economic History Society between the years of 1951 and 1967. She was made an Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Belgium in 1961 and a fellow of the British Academy in 1963. She also was given an honorary doctorate in 1968 from Smith College. Carus-Wilson died on 1 February 1977.  Work  Carus-Wilson focused on medieval economic history. During the beginning of WWII, she started publishing her research on the cloth industry in England. Her paper, \\"An industrial revolution of the thirteenth century,\\" was \\"widely read,\\" and discussed how medieval textile workers made significant contributions to the technology of textile work in England. Her work led to the \\"discovery of the importance of rural industry in late-medieval England,\\" according to The Economic History Review. She, along with scholars, Lewis Mumford and Marc Bloch, \\"captured the imaginations of a younger generation of scholars in the emergent field of the history of technology with their new vision of medieval technological prowess.\\" Carus-Wilson studied 13th century England's textile industry and described a \\"rapid adoption of waterpowered fulling.\\" Her article used research drawn from primary sources such as royal and ecclesiastical records. Her research showed a type of revolution in technology that was similar to the Industrial Revolution in the amount of change it caused in 13th century England and how quickly it was adopted. In the early 1960s, she contributed 2 chapters on the wool industry to the second volume of the Cambridge Economic History of Europe (1963), which The Economic History Review called \\"valuable.\\"  Publications  *Medieval Merchant Venturers (London, 1954) - collected essays, 1929 to 1950. *England's Export Trade 1275‚Äì1547, with Olive Coleman (Oxford, 1963).

Designed by architect Henry Bacon, the building was the flagship department store of the Halle Brothers Co. from 1910 to 1982. The Halle Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 8, 1983, and converted to office space in 1986. On November 19, 1995, the Halle Building was listed as a contributing property to the Lower Prospect‚ÄîHuron Historic District. The Halle Building was purchased by K & D Group in 2014. The ground floor was converted back to retail, and the sixth through tenth floors turned into apartments. The Pope Building In 1900, the site of the original (1910) and the addition (1914) Halle buildings was occupied by mostly by single-story wood frame houses. On the east side of the intersection of E. 12th Place (also known as \\"Short Alley\\") and Euclid Avenue were two low-rise, mixed-used buildings, 1208 Euclid and 1218 Euclid. Built between 1874 and 1881, they contained retail and offices on the first few floors and residential housing above. 1111 Huron Road, another office building located slightly southeast of (but on the same lot as) 1218 Euclid, was built about the same time. There were also several large structures on or adjacent to the site. The earliest of these was the Cleveland Wheel Club, finished in 1893 and located on the east side of the intersection of E. 12th Place and Huron Road. It was later known as the Wyandot House hotel. The next major structure was the Euclid Point Building (also known more simply as the \\"Point Building\\"), which began construction in 1907 at the intersection of Huron Road and Euclid Avenue (1260 Euclid Avenue). The large property between the Euclid Point Building and the future site of the Halle Building was leased in 1909, and became the Winous Building.; The Cleveland lodge of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks began construction of a 4.5 story office and retail structure at 1041 Huron Road in 1909. The structure was finished in March 1911. =Planning= In 1905,; former Cleveland resident Alfred Atmore Pope and one of his business associates, Harrison Whittemore, purchased the site of the Halle Building and began planning the construction of a 16-story office building on the eastern portion of the site (adjacent to the Point Building). Pope took the lead in overseeing the project, hiring New York City architect Henry Bacon to design the structure. By June 1907, plans for the building were largely complete. It was reduced to just 10 stories and had a frontage on both Euclid Avenue and Huron Road, giving the structure an average depth of . The skin of the building was brick facade clad in glazed terracotta. Bacon designed a structure with three below-ground levels. In addition to the basement, there were two sub-basements, the lowest of which was intended to be used as a station for a then-planned Cleveland subway. The existing structures between 1218 Euclid/1111 Huron and the Point Building were demolished, Cleveland-area builders traveled to New York City consult with Pope and Bacon, and test drillings were conducted at the site to determine the quality of the underlying soil and rock. =Quicksand solution= Sheet steel piling in place along Huron Road Tidewater Construction, a New York firm, began excavation toward the end of June 1907. Quicksand was soon discovered. The geology of the site consisted of of soil, of watery sand, of quicksand, and then a very deep vein of hard, blue clay. The surprising discovery of quicksand required extensive soil engineering by superintendent of design L.J. Lincoln (Bacon's chief assistant) and structural engineer F.A. Burdette. Their solution was to redesign the foundation so the building could \\"float\\" on the bed of quicksand. The T.B. Bryson company of New York City was the general contractor for the cofferdam. To create the cofferdam, Bryson excavated to the watery sand. About 600 steel sheets, manufactured by Carnegie Steel and each long and wide, were then driven completely into ground. This left the sheets embedded in about of the blue clay. Sheet-driving was subcontracted to the Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. Each steel sheet dovetailed with the one next to it, and soft pine splines inserted into the dovetails. The wood swelled when it came into contact with water, helping to ensure a tight seal. Sheet-driving began in the middle of the west side, and worked counter-clockwise. Because 1218 Euclid had a very shallow foundation, a two-story concrete wall had to be erected to support building while excavation occurred. A drop hammer rather than a steam hammer was used on the east side as well, as sheet-driving occurred within of the adjacent structure's wall. Once the sheet-driving reached the east side, work began in the middle of the west side and worked clockwise around the site. Special care needed to be taken on the Euclid Avenue side of the building due to the danger of cave-ins. The work met at the northeast corner of the site. The Bryson company then drove large, round wooden piles through the quicksand and into the clay below. The interior of the cofferdam was excavated, and timber braces (each in thickness and long) were placed apart to help stabilize the sheeting until the foundation and interior walls could be constructed. =Foundation= A complex system of grillage, cantilevers, offset wall columns, and supports was needed for the foundation of the Pope Building The foundation of the Pope Building is a combination of reinforced concrete floating raft and grillage. Reengineering the foundation due to the quicksand problem meant only a single sub-basement was constructed. In the sub-basement, the sheet piling was plastered and then waterproofed with felt and tar. The felt/tar waterproofing was flashed over the top of the sheet piling and extended horizontally about past the outer wall. Below the sub- basement floor was another waterproofing layer that consisted of of reinforced concrete poured atop the watery sand and then topped with felt and tar. The sub-basement walls were built directly against the waterproofed sheet piling, and made of concrete thick. The upper part of the sub-basement walls were reinforced with rebar thick and apart. Grillages to hold the columns in place were placed atop the waterproof layer. Each grillage consisted of two tiers of interlocking I-beams. Each grill supported a single one of the 40 columns that made up the building's superstructure. The floor of the sub-basement was poured atop the waterproofing layer, and made of reinforced concrete. Originally, the building was to have relied on the sheet piling and sub- basement wall columns to support the outer walls. Structural engineers, however, felt that the re-engineered steel sheet pilings would give way under the centripetal forces placed on it by the quicksand as well as the building's weight. This required them to alter their plan for the wall columns that supported the building's frame and upper floors. The new foundation's wall columns (now called \\"fulcrums\\") were set inward from the sub-basement wall. Each fulcrum consisted of two C-beams, each wide and held together by four cover plates. A girder, made of steel plates bolted together and long, wide, and deep, acted as a cantilever. One end was anchored atop the fulcrum, while the other end was supported by a \\"cantilever support column\\" (almost identical to the fulcrum) set from the sub-basement wall. There were no steel wall columns against the outside walls of the basement or above-ground floors. Rather, a cup-like seat surrounded the inward end of the cantilever beam and the top of the fulcrum. Into this was seated the load-bearing column above (which, like those in the sub-basement, were set inward from the exterior wall). The downward pressure of the load-bearing column helped to keep the cantilever in place atop the fulcrum, which in turn acted like a lever to support the exterior walls of the basement and upper floors. Between the grills, of reinforced concrete helped to spread the load and keep the grills in place. The concrete between the grillage and for the floor was poured as a single unit thick. A short girder was placed between the base of each near- wall column and the grillage surrounding the fulcrum to help the grillage and floor retain integrity. A thick brick wall was built against the waterproofed sheet piling in the basement. Against this brick wall, a thick concrete wall was poured. The basement floor was made of reinforced concrete, and designed to support the weight of the building's steam heating plant, air conditioning plant, and other mechanical equipment. The load-bearing columns in the basement were all long. The Pope Building had the deepest basement in Cleveland. It was likely that this was the first time steel sheeting had been used as pilings in a large building anywhere in the United States, and local architects and The Plain Dealer newspaper called the soil engineering and foundation the most successful method of dealing with quicksand that the nation had ever seen. The original basement and foundation design had an estimated cost of $175,000 ($ in dollars). Under the revised plans, the cost of the cofferdam alone was estimated at between $150,000 and $200,000 ($ to $ in dollars), and that of the foundations $200,000 ($ in dollars). The final total cost of both the cofferdam and the foundation was $500,000 ($ in dollars). Work began on the cofferdam on August 20, 1907, and took about two months to complete. About of concrete and of steel were used just for the foundation, which was finished about the end of 1907. As with nearly all foundations, the below-ground levels of the Pope Building were not intended to be completely watertight. The sub-basement was designed to collect water, which would then be pumped out into the city's sewer system. Because Cleveland's sewer lines were only below-ground, this meant that the water had to be pumped upward before it could enter the sewer line. =Completion of the original building= International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers who erected the frame of the Pope Building Tidewater Construction was awarded the contract to complete the building's superstructure. The of steel for the edifice was provided by the Pittsburgh Steel Construction Co., and arrived in mid-September 1908. The facade was made of brick faced with terracotta. The cream-colored, speckled, full-enamel terracotta was manufactured by the North Western Terra Cotta Company, and each tile was numbered so that workers knew exactly where it should go on the building's facade. The brick was made by the Cleveland Hydraulic Press Brick Company. The exterior wall of the first floor was made of reinforced concrete thick, waterproofed with a layer of felt, tar, and burlap. The rebar in the exterior wall was horizontal, carrying weight from column to column without putting too much pressure on the soil below. Above the first floor, two I-beams were attached to the exterior of the frame of the building. One carried the brickwork facade and the other carried the interior floor. The girders supporting floors two through ten were supported by rolled I-beams, with no more than between each girder. The concrete enclosing the girders and the concrete for the floor were poured at the same time. The concrete enclosing the girders rose to a minimum of above the girders, while the reinforced concrete for the floor itself was thick. On November 28, 1908, the Halle Bros. department store signed a long-term lease for the entire Pope Building. This allowed the company to move from its existing location at Euclid Avenue and E. 6th Street, and to double its space. =About the structure as originally built= The structure was routinely referred to as the Pope Building, even two years after Halle Bros. leased it. As originally constructed, the Pope Building consisted of 10 floors, a basement, and a sub-basement. The building had a frontage of on both Euclid Avenue and Huron Road, was deep, and high at the roof line. Each floor had ceilings. With of usable interior space, it was one of the largest retail structures in the Midwest. Access to the building was provided by one freight and five passenger elevators. The interior of the public elevators were highly ornate. Each floor could also be reached by the public via marble stairways. Employees had their own utilitarian staircase, hidden from public view. Recently enacted city regulations required that the building include a fire escape. The Pope Building's fire escape was external to the structure proper and located on the Huron Road side. It was enclosed in its own bay, which projected outward from the building and had extensive windows to provide natural light. A mechanical roofhouse contained the elevator machinery, a laundry, and a separate air circulation system serving the kitchen and bathrooms. Bert L. Baldwin & Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio, designed the electrical, heating, and ventilating systems. The Smith & Obey Co. of Cleveland installed the heating and ventilation. All the heating and ventilation equipment was located in the sub-basement. The heating system consisted of two Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers, Worthington steam pumps, and two separate heating delivery systems. The sub-basement, basement, and first floor were warmed via air heated in the sub-basement and then blown through ventilation ducts. This system also provided forced (but not cooled) air when heating was not needed. The second through tenth floors relied on a \\"Paul\\" dual high- and low-pressure steam system built by the Automatic Heating Company and using steam radiators designed and built by the American Radiator Company. The ventilation system was designed and built by the Donaldson Company. This system both dehumidified and filtered the air. A system provided air to the sub-basement and basement, while a separate system provided air to the first floor. A central spine in the building contained the electrical system, fresh water plumbing, and central vacuum system. All the public floors were covered with hardwood, while the walls above featured Circassian walnut wainscoting and marble paneling. Most counters, chairs, and other interior fixtures were of mahogany. The lobbies on Euclid Avenue and Huron Road drew special attention from the press, which noted their solid bronze doors and fixtures and the extensive use of verde antique, Italian white, and Italian green marble. The total cost of the Pope Building was slightly more than $1.5 million ($ in dollars). The Pope Building opened to the public on February 21, 1910. Thousands of people thronged the structure. Halle Bros. was open for business, but customers were permitted only to look at the store and browse items for sale for the first few days. The department store occupied the entire structure. Bargains were sold in the basement. The first floor contained the glove, jewelry, and men's accessories departments, with bedding, fabric, sewing goods, and shoes sold on the second floor. Women's lingerie and underwear, European gowns, and baby and infant needs were sold on the third floor, while clothing for young and teenage girls as well as hats were sold on the fourth. The fourth floor also contained the public restrooms and a parlor where customers could make telephone calls. Home furnishings such as curtains and drapes, upholstery for furniture, and rugs were sold on the sixth floor. The entire seventh floor was given over to a restaurant. Two-thirds of this space was a lunch room which featured ivory-tinted walls. The remainder was a tea room which was paneled in English Oak. The eighth floor housed the offices of Halle Bros. (with executive suites facing Euclid Avenue). Employees had access to a lounge, dressing area, and showers on this floor. Much of the tenth (top) floor was lit via rooftop skylights, and was where the fine furs and tailoring departments were located. The Pope Building sparked a major revitalization of the shopping district on upper Euclid Avenue. With the Swetland Building (1910) at 1010 Euclid and the Cleveland Athletic Club building (1911) at 1118 Euclid, the Pope Building helped create an almost unbroken city block of buildings with deep foundations. 1914 addition =Planning and construction= In 1912, Alfred A. Pope agreed to build an addition to the original building for Halle Bros. The 10-story addition was directly west of the first structure, with a frontage on both Euclid Avenue and Huron Road and an east‚Äìwest average depth of . The west wall of the original structure was modified so that the two buildings would become one. Henry Bacon designed the addition, as he had designed the original structure. The addition was almost a copy of the original building. It had a steel frame and floors of reinforced concrete, and a brick fa√ßade covered in cream terracotta. One major change provided for extensive rooftop structures, set back from the edge and enclosed by a parapet, for employee use. A new, grand colonnade was also planned for the E. 12th Place side of the addition on the ground floor. Behind the colonnade, a row of small shops and stores were planned. E. 12th Place was one of Cleveland's narrowest streets, and only wide. Its sidewalks were so narrow, people could walk on them only in single file. The city gave permission for the addition to encroach on part of the street. At its north and south ends, the new colonnade was wide, but only wide in its middle. E. 12th Place was closed to vehicular traffic to accommodate the colonnade. A third major entrance to Halle Bros. was planned for E. 12th Place as well, with a grand staircase leading up to the second floor and down to the basement. Tidewater Construction was given the construction contract. The estimated cost of the addition was $750,000 ($ in dollars). Construction on the addition began about August 1913. Tidewater Construction installed a temporary wooden colonnade on Euclid Avenue to protect people on sidewalk from falling construction debris. This type of safety measure had never before been seen in Cleveland, and it won high praise from the Cleveland Real Estate Board. The first serious construction accidents on either Pope building were recorded during construction of the addition. Iron worker Fred Horton, age 32, died after falling several stories from a steel beam into the basement on October 14. James O'Brien fell two stories into the basement on October 27, but he landed on a pile of sand (which saved his life). In early December 1913, Tidewater Construction agreed to recognize its various construction unions, and signed a contract with the Building and Construction Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor. =About the 1914 addition= The addition formally opened on November 2, 1914, increasing the size of the total available space to . The enlargement allowed Halle Bros. to offer a broader range of products, and for the first time the company began to sell candy, furniture, and men's clothing. In addition to air filtration/tempering, heating, and ventilation, the sub-basement of the addition contained the elevator machinery and a pneumatic message system. A central spine in the building contained a spiral conveyor belt, the driving machinery for which was also in the sub-basement. With this system, merchandise could be moved from one floor to another where it could be retrieved by a staff person and given to a customer. As in the original building, the basement was where bargains were sold. For the first time, Halle's had enough space to begin selling men's and boys' clothing. These departments were also located in basement, beneath the colonnade on the addition's west side. The first floor of the addition sold men's accessories and gloves, sporting goods, and select children's toys. The west side of the addition's first floor consisted of several small, self- contained stores which the department store called \\"Men's Row\\". Each of these stores could be accessed via the colonnade, or from the interior of the building. The first floor vestibule was accessed from E. 12th Place, and the entire floor was covered in marble. Patrons could reach the second floor or the basement from the vestibule via a grand marble staircase or an elevator. The second floor was actually a mezzanine, with each department located in its own small, enclosed shop. Departments on this floor included with bedding, fabric, sewing goods, shoes, fine jewelry, small imported porcelain items, and novelties. An information desk on the mezzanine level provided areas where customers could write notes or letters, a kiosk where individuals could purchase tickets to local concerts or plays, several public telephones, a kiosk for the dropping off and picking up of dry cleaning, and a post office. Women's lingerie and underwear and baby and infant needs were sold on the third floor. A greatly expanded women's evening wear department, which included a stage surrounded by lighted mirrors (so customers could view themselves from all angles) existed on the fourth floor. A new department which sold specialized mourning wear, a children's barber, and a manicurist's parlor also occupied the fourth floor. Bedroom, dining room, living room, and library furniture and accessories were sold on the fifth floor, while home d√©cor items and a home decorating service occupied the sixth. Most of the seventh floor consisted of dining establishments. These included a new 75-seat men's lunchroom, furnished in an Italian style and serving grilled items; a tea room decorated in the American Colonial style; and a tea room in a Japanese style. Another children's toy department existed on the seventh floor as well, and adjacent to it was a playground (supervised by store staff) in which small children could play in a sandbox, in a child-size house, or on playground equipment. Adjacent to the playground was an enclosed, golf instruction green. Golfing lessons were given here, and golfing equipment sold nearby. Halle Bros. offices occupied the eighth floor, reserve stock was located on the ninth floor, and the tenth floor held vaults where customers could store fine furs, rugs, and textiles. These vaults were cooled to between , and accessed via a portal of sandstone carved in the Egyptian Revival style. A portion of the tenth floor also contained a tailor's department where alterations could be made. The roofhouses had glass walls and ceilings, and contained a lunchroom, men's smoking room, and women's lounge‚Äîall for the exclusive use of employees. 1949 addition About 1945, Halle Bros. purchased the Elks building at 1051 Huron Road as well as the former Wyandot House (now an office building) at 1103 Huron Road. The company planned a $10 million ($ in dollars) expansion project that included a downtown service building, branches in several Cleveland suburbs, and a new addition to its flagship store in Cleveland. The noted local architectural firm of Walker & Weeks designed the addition. Work on the downtown expansion did not begin until 1947, as World War II-era restrictions on new building and materials were lifted only gradually after hostilities ended. Demolition of the Elks building did not occur until February 1947. The new addition was 12 stories high. Halle Bros. removed the roofhouse structures atop its existing two buildings, and constructed two new stories atop the 1910 and 1914 structures to make them the same height as the new wing. New elevators were installed in the 1910 and 1914 buildings during the construction, and the new 12th floors housed new air conditioning units. Escalators were also added to the 1910 and 1914 buildings at this time. The colonnade on E. 12th Place was demolished. The street was excavated, and a tunnel connecting the basement of the 1914 and 1949 buildings constructed there. When finished, E. 12th Place was reopened for one-way vehicular traffic. In addition to the tunnel, a bridge connected the 1914 and 1949 buildings at the third floor. A.T. Knudsen, a local firm, began work on the cofferdam in April 1947. The Sam W. Emerson Co. of Cleveland was the general contractor. The superstructure and most of the internal construction was complete by October 1948. The basement and first floor opened in November 1948, and the third floor in December 1948. Every month thereafter, another floor opened. The mezzanine (second floor) opened on July 27, 1949, marking the completion of the $5 million ($ in dollars) West Wing addition. The West Wing had the same brick and cream terracotta fa√ßade as the other Halle buildings. Only the basement and first through seventh floors were open to the public, giving the department store an additional of retail space. The main entrances of the West Wing were on Huron Road and E. 12th Place. Display windows were not a feature of the West Wing; instead, large windows allowed the public to look into the court of the building and observe customers and salespeople. The eighth through 12th floors of the West Wing were reserved for employee use. The eighth, ninth, and 10th floors consisted of office space, a goods marking and receiving department, and the advertising and display departments. The 11th floor housed three classrooms where employees received training, the employee cafeteria, a kitchen, a bakery, and an ice cream manufacturing facility. (These latter three provided food to all three of the company's employee restaurants in downtown Cleveland.) The 11th floor also had a 15-room clinic, hospital, and dental center. This healthcare center, which was accredited by the American College of Surgeons, served customers who became ill while shopping at Halle's. Employees also received low-cost healthcare there as part of their benefits package. The 12th floor housed maintenance shops and the building's air conditioning equipment. The western portion of the 12th floor housed the Halle's employee lounge (with views of The Flats to the west). A staircase led from this lounge to the roof, where employees could enjoy a rooftop garden. Atop the roof was a water tower. The second-highest water tower in the city at the time, it provided pressure for the fire control sprinkler system. Post-Halle's history of the building =Closure of Halle's= Halle Bros. occupied what now became known as the Halle Building until the early 1980s. The company was sold to Marshall Field's in 1970, and then to Associated Investors Corporation in November 1981. Associated Investors closed all the Halle's stores, including the downtown flagship store, in January 1982. =Conversion to offices= Forest City Enterprises took at 50 percent ownership in the building in June 1982. Six months later, Forest City and Jacob Schottenstein, majority owner of Associated Investors, formed a joint venture named S&R; Playhouse Realty Co. to renovate the building. S&R; Playhouse Realty sought to renovate floors two through 11 into of office space, and to remodel the basement, first floor, and mezzanine into of retail and restaurant space. The Halle Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 8, 1983. S&R; Playhouse Realty asked Cuyahoga County officials for $10 million ($ in dollars) in industrial bond revenues to pay for the $27 million ($ in dollars) in redevelopment costs it wanted to incur. S&R; Playhouse Realty formed a subsidiary, Halle Office Building Limited Partnership, and assigned it a 50 percent interest in the office portion of the building. S&R; Playhouse Realty sold the other half to outside investors. Forest City and Schottenstein put $8.4 million ($ in dollars) of their own money into the project as well. The ultimate cost of the renovation was $31 million ($ in dollars). The city of Cleveland gave a $7.1 million ($ in dollars) federal Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) loan and Cuyahoga County gave a $14 million ($ in dollars) industrial development loan (funded by a bond issue) to S&R; Playhouse Realty to assist in paying for the remodeling. The basement (now called a \\"concourse\\") became a 400-seat food court named Cabaret. Each office floor had of space. The escalators were enclosed but not removed in case a client leased more than one floor. The 10th and 11th floors became a health club. The city of Cleveland and other area landlords agreed to improve their properties at the same time as part of a broader attempt to improve the economic viability of the area around the Halle Building. In 1983, the eastern portion of the Point Building was demolished. Huron Road was redirected to turn north through this portion of the Point Building site, connecting it with E. 13th Street. A new mini-park and plaza was created on the old site of the road. =Hotel construction to the east= In the fall of 1987, local developers proposed demolishing the remainder of the Point Building and constructing a new luxury hotel on the site to serve the reviving Playhouse Square district to the east of the Halle Building. The Point Building was razed in the fall of 1988 to prepare for this construction. Demolition of the structure left the windowless, blank eastern wall of the Halle Building facing Playhouse Square. The $27.6 million ($ in dollars) Wyndham Hotel at Playhouse Square broke ground in July 1993, and opened on July 7, 1995. On November 19, 1995, the Lower Prospect‚ÄîHuron Historic District (of which the Halle Building is a contributing property) was added to the National Register of Historic Places. =Operational history of the office building= In March 1997, Forest City agreed to move its headquarters into downtown Cleveland's Terminal Tower and remain there for 15 years. In exchange, the city of Cleveland forgave half the 1985 UDAG which had been used to renovate the Halle Building. Forest City also said it would pay off the remaining balance of the UDAG by 1999 as part of the deal. The Halle Building was just two-thirds occupied in 2004, and dramatically slowing business over the last several years meant that only eight restaurants remained in the Cabaret food court by 2006. In 2006, New York City-based real estate investor Stuart Venner (doing business as \\"216 Jamaica Avenue LLC\\") purchased the land under the Halle Building from the land's owner, Realty Investment Corporation, for $845,000 ($ in dollars). Venner discovered that the original 1910 lease (still in force as of 2006) contained a \\"gold clause\\" that permitted rent to rise with the price of gold. Halle Bros. and Forest City's rent had remained at $35,000 a year since 1912. When Venner invoked the gold clause, Forest City's rent for the land beneath the Halle Building rose to more than $1.4 million a year. Forest City's S&R; Playhouse Realty subsidiary (which had been assigned the lease) sued to have the gold clause declared invalid, but in August 2008 the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the gold clause in the lease. K&D; Group ownership =Putting the building up for sale= In late 2012, Forest City announced it was putting the Halle Building on the market after an attempt to secure a large tenant collapsed. The company took a $30.2 million ($ in dollars) loss on the building and reduced its value to $10.5 million ($ in dollars). Cuyahoga County began to seek a new location for its government operations, and Forest City submitted the Halle Building as a potential site in September 2012. Forest City offered to sell the structure \\"as is\\", but the county chose to build a headquarters instead. In October 2013, Forest City reiterated in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it still intended to sell the building or redevelop it with a partner. By the summer of 2014, the Halle Building was only 50 percent occupied. =K&D; Group purchase= K & D Group of Willoughby, Ohio, purchased the Halle Building and the parking garage across the street on Huron Road for $20 million ($ in dollars) on December 3, 2014. K&D; Group hired Berardi+Partners, a Columbus- based architectural firm, to design the renovations. K&D; said it would convert the upper floors into 240 apartments, refurbish two floors and retain them as office space, and add 80 basement parking spaces to the 600-space garage across Huron Road. The company initially said construction would begin in 2016, but just days later pushed the start of construction to 2018. K&D; Group applied for a state of Ohio historic preservation tax credit for 2015, but was not successful. The company applied again in 2016, and won a $5 million ($ in dollars) credit. The credit was the maximum amount allowed. K&D; Group now planned to add an atrium to the center of the building. The company changed its plans for residential housing at the Halle Building, now only converting the upper six floors to apartments. (It said there would be 125 apartments ranging in size from in size.) About of space on the lower floors was reserved for office tenants and retailers. K&D; Group also won a federal historic preservation tax credit and $11.3 million ($ in dollars) in federal New Markets Tax Credit Program loans to assist with the renovation. K&D; Group established two subsidiaries, both condominiums, to own the Halle Building. One was assigned the five-floor office/retail section and the other the five- floor residential portion. An particularly complex financing package fell into place in the late spring of 2017. Construction on the $60 million ($ in dollars) Halle Building conversion began in June, with the office floors being renovated first so that upper-floor tenants could move down and free up space for the residential conversion. Cleveland Construction Inc. of Mentor, Ohio, was the general contractor. About The Residences at Halle Floors six through 10 of the Halle Building are now known as The Residences at Halle. Floors six through nine contain 122 one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, while the 10th and 11th floors contain 12 larger, two-story \\"penthouse\\" luxury units. Units range in size from on the sixth through ninth floors, and up to in the penthouse apartments. Residents have access to a fitness center on a lower floor as well as parking in the Huron Road garage (accessible via a tunnel under Huron Road). Residential tenants began moving into The Residences at Halle in August 2018, with construction on all units scheduled for completion in January 2019. In popular culture During the late 1990s, the Halle Building's facade was used as the location of the fictional Winfred- Louder store on The Drew Carey Show. A portion of a fight scene between Spider-Man and Sandman was filmed in front of the Halle Building for the film Spider-Man 3 (2007).

Early years Martinez attended the Clovis West High School in Fresno, California. He played both football and basketball in high school. He missed his senior season of football due to a torn labrum he suffered while playing basketball. As a junior, he was the Fresno Bee football player of the year after he passed for 2,562 yards with 25 touchdowns and rushed for 1,462 yards and 14 touchdowns. Martinez was regarded as a four-star prospect and was the seventh-highest-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2018 according to the 247Sports Composite. Martinez originally committed to play college football at the University of California, Berkeley and University of Tennessee before ultimately deciding on the University of Nebraska. College career =2018= First-year Nebraska head coach Scott Frost named Martinez the starting quarterback heading into the 2018 season opener, making him the first true freshman to ever begin a season as the starting quarterback at Nebraska. In the Cornhuskers' opening game against Colorado, Martinez threw for 187 yards, one touchdown, and an interception, and added 117 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on the ground. Nebraska lost the game 33‚Äì28. Martinez went down with a knee injury in the final minutes of the Colorado game, an injury that also caused him to miss the following game against Troy, which also ended in a loss for Nebraska. Martinez returned from injury but could not help the Cornhuskers return to winning form, as the team lost its first six games of the year for the worst start to a season in program history. Martinez's first career win came against Minnesota, where he threw for 276 yards and three passing touchdowns, and ran for another touchdown on the ground in the 53‚Äì28 victory. He was named Big Ten Co-Freshman of the Week (with Rondale Moore) for the performance. Martinez earned two more Big Ten Freshman of the Week honors following a loss to Ohio State on November 3 and a victory over Illinois on November 10. Martinez finished his freshman season with 2,617 passing yards, 17 passing touchdowns, and eight interceptions. He added 629 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns on the ground. He finished sixth in the Big Ten Conference in passing yards and total touchdowns, and was fourth in passer rating. =2019= Martinez received high expectations heading into his sophomore season in 2019, earning pre-season honors at Big Ten Media Days and even appearing in Heisman Trophy candidate discussions. However, he struggled mightily, leading Nebraska to a 5-7 record in a disappointing season.

Originally broadcast on the British television channel Dave on 9 November 2017, it was made available early on 2 November 2017 on UKTV Play. After Red Dwarf receives a long-overdue software update, the crew learn their employer has been purchased in a takeover by M-Corp, the universe's largest multi- national conglomerate. Synopsis On his 50th birthday, Lister has what appears to be a heart attack, but come further analysis by Kryten, appears to have been a severe case of indigestion. Just to be safe, Kryten uploads a health-monitoring chip, Chippy, into his bloodstream. However, Chippy ends up exploding and Kryten launches an investigation into the matter. Some time later, Kryten finds Chippy had died due to running on old software, and that Red Dwarf was in dire need of a system update halted due to Cat unplugging it to make way for his personal items. After installing the update, the crew are greeted by M-Corp, who reveal they've bought-out the JMC, the former owners of Red Dwarf, in a corporate takeover. Immediately afterward, new equipment branded by M-Corp materializes on board the ship, but Lister, for whatever reason, can only see the M-Corp equipment and not non-related M-Corp products, such as his Leopard Lager. After some tests, Kryten concludes that the new M-Corp update is blocking Lister's perception of reality, making non-M-Corp products disappear including Kryten (DivaDroid not being owned by M-Corp), Rimmer (his light bee not being manufactured by M-Corp) and Cat (not an employee of M-Corp) become mute and invisible to Lister. Lister is now essentially alone on board the ship, with many of his personal items invisible to him, such as his beloved guitar, his shaving razor and the couch that he sleeps on. Suddenly, M-Corp materialize a portal in the sleeping quarters, which transports Lister to a new, M-Corp simulation where he must trade a limited currency allocated to his account for menial items, such as drinking water. His currency quickly gets depleted thanks to astronomical prices and the M-Corp software begins charging him in time from his lifespan, quickly aging him. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew decide the uninstall the new M-Corp update from the ship after initiating a master reboot, and enter the teleporter into the M-Corp simulation. After tricking the software into corrupting itself, the crew retrieve Lister, now de-aged thanks to the M-Corp installation, and return to Red Dwarf. Lister, however, is still unable to see non-M-Corp products, including the crew, so Kryten decides to essentially reboot Lister's memory to fix the issue, using his 23-year-old memory as saved to the Hologram Projection Suite and rebuilding the rest of his memory via CCTV footage. The episode ends with Lister annoying Rimmer, in a fashion referencing the very first scene of the first episode. Production The final scene referencing the beginning of \\"The End\\" wasn't able to be filmed on the night of the recording in front of the live studio audience; however, Doug Naylor and the crew still wanted the audience members to experience it and so staged it anyway.

In the 1970s, he released a new record titled Huysuz Virjin 1. In 2007, Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT√úK) announced that his program could no longer be broadcast on television channels and that he would no longer revive the character of Huysuz Virjin but he presented the dance program Huysuz'la Dans Eder misin? on Show TV in 2012. In the same year, he joined Benzemez Kimse Sana as a judge which aired on Star TV. On the program's final episode, he appeared as Huysuz Virjin and said \\"This is my last kanto\\", implying that he could not sing kanto again due to his age. He later announced that he would donate 15 million of his property to the Association for the Support of Contemporary Living.  Death  He died on 17 July 2020 at Istanbul Acƒ±badem Altunizade Hospital due to complications from pneumonia brought by COPD.

It is by far the shortest of Uzbekistan's external borders. Map of Afghanistan with Uzbekistan to the north Description The entire border follows the thalweg of the Amu Darya river, from the Turkmen tripoint in the west to the Tajik tripoint in the east. The border is paralleled on the Uzbek side by a road and railway line, and there is a major crossing point to the east of the Uzbek town of Termez. Uzbekistan has built a barrier along the border, consisting of a barbed wire fence and a second, taller, 380-volt electrified barbed-wire fence, land mines and a patrol of heavily armed Uzbek soldiers. History The border was inherited from the old Soviet Union-Afghan border which largely took its current shape during the 19th century Anglo-Russian rivalry in Central Asia known as the Great Game. With the Russian Empire having conquered the Khanate of Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara, and with the British Empire controlling the British Raj, the two powers agreed to leave Afghanistan as an independent buffer state between them. In 1873 Britain and Russia agreed on a rough formulation of the border, with the Amu Darya declared to be the border going east from the vicinity of the village of Khwaja Salar to Lake Zorku, with the Wakhan Corridor to remain in Afghanistan. The western section of the border (i.e. the bulk of the modern Afghan-Turkmen boundary) was to be determined at a later date by a boundary commission. Tensions mounted as the Russians expanded further into what is now Turkmenistan in the early 1880s, reaching a crisis with the Panjdeh incident (near Sandykachi in what is now Turkmenistan), an area claimed by Afghanistan. Discussions calmed the situation and a joint Anglo-Russian boundary commission demarcated the boundary as it is today over the period 1885‚Äì88. As the village of Khwaja Salar could no longer be identified it was agreed that the boundary should meet the Amu Darya in the vicinity of Khamiab, Afghanistan. The easternmost section of the border (now forming part of the Afghan-Tajik boundary) was not finally delimited until 1893‚Äì95, with the Afghans agreeing to waive any claims to lands north the Amu Darya. This agreement also stipulated the position of the land border in section east of Lake Zorkul up to China, with a series of boundary pillars subsequently erected. In 1921 a Soviet-Afghan treaty was signed whereby Russia agreed \\"to hand over to Afghanistan the frontier districts which belonged to the latter in the last century, observing the principles of justice and self-determination of the population inhabiting the same.\\" However this treaty was never implemented, and was explicitly annulled by the Frontier Agreement of 1946, which kept the boundary as it was, with riverine islands to be subsequently allocated by a joint commission. Soviet forces withdraw across the Amu Darya, 1989 In 1979 Soviet troops of the 40th Army crossed the border at Termez via a series of pontoons as part of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, en route to Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul. They later constructed the Friendship Bridge, which officially opened in 1982, however its strategic importance led to it being a target of the Mujahideen insurgency. The Soviet army left Afghanistan via the bridge in 1989. The bridge was closed from 1997 to 2001 due to Uzbek fears over Taliban insurgency, before re-opening to allow aid in following their fall in 2001. As of 2018 it remains the only fixed crossing between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

Background With the growth of McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare, the subject of communism in America began to loom large in the public consciousness. History In 1951, Robert M. Hutchins became the president of the Fund for the Republic, a non-profit organization whose basic objectives were to research and analyze civil liberties and civil rights. In 1954, Wilbur Hugh Ferry became Fund vice president, responsible for administration and public relations, and moved with the Fund to Santa Barbara 1959. In August 1953, Clifford P.

Walter Millis, former editorial and staff writer for the New York Herald Tribune (1924‚Äì1954), became a staff member of the Fund for the Republic (1954‚Äì1968). Bethuel M. Webster served as legal counsel to the Fund and represented the Fund in hearings before the notorious Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives (HUAC). During this period he also defended William Remington, an economist and alleged Communist accused of espionage. Political scientist Clinton Rossiter of Cornell University directed the Fund for the Republic, which aimed to publish a full- scale history of American communism. It engaged David A. Shannon of the University of Wisconsin to write the history of the Communist Party USA during the post-war period. In 1952, it engaged Theodore Draper to write a monograph on the party's early years. Draper had already been thinking of writing a \\"traditional\\" history of the Party, based upon documentary sources and meeting scholarly standards. In 1954, Millis became the director of the Fund's study of demilitarization. Robert W. Iversen wrote a book for the fund called Communism and the Schools, published in 1959.

Named for the Austrian emperor and Hungarian king Franz Joseph I, Kaiser Franz Joseph I was the lead ship of her namesake class. Constructed by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste, she was laid down in January 1888 and launched in May 1889. Kaiser Franz Joseph I was commissioned into the Navy in June 1890. As the first protected cruiser constructed by the Austro-Hungarian Navy, she was intended to serve as Austria-Hungary's response to the Italian cruisers and . Her design was heavily influenced by the Jeune √âcole (Young School), a naval strategy which had gained prominence in the 1880s as a means to combat a larger and more heavily armored navy of battleships through the use of torpedo flotillas. Changes in technology and strategic thinking through the adoption of Alfred Thayer Mahan's \\"decisive battle\\" doctrine which stressed the construction of powerful battleships as the primary capital ship of navies around the world rendered the design of the Kaiser Franz Joseph I obsolete shortly after her commissioning. Nevertheless, she and her sister ship remained an important component of Austro-Hungarian naval policy, which continued to emphasize coastal defense and overseas missions to show the flag around the world. During the course of her career, Kaiser Franz Joseph I participated in several overseas voyages, including several tours of duty to defend Austro-Hungarian interests in China following the Boxer Rebellion. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Kaiser Franz Joseph I was assigned to the Fifth Battle Division and stationed at the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro. Due to her age and obsolete design, Kaiser Franz Joseph I saw little action during most of the conflict, though she did participate in shelling Franco-Montenegrin artillery batteries located on the slopes of Mount Lovƒáen in late 1914, which overshadowed the Bocche di Cattaro. In January 1916, when the Austria-Hungary began an invasion of Montenegro, Kaiser Franz Joseph I assisted in again silencing Montenegrin batteries on Mount Lovƒáen in support of the Austro-Hungarian Army, which seized the mountain and subsequently captured the Montenegrin capital of Cetinje, knocking the country out of the war. In 1917, Kaiser Franz Joseph I was decommissioned, disarmed, and converted into a headquarters ship for the Austro-Hungarian base at Cattaro. She remained in this capacity through the rest of the war. When Austria- Hungary was facing defeat in October 1918, the Austrian government transferred its navy to the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in order to avoid having to hand the ship over to the Allies. Following the Armistice of Villa Giusti in November 1918, an Allied fleet sailed into Cattaro and seized the former Austro-Hungarian ships stationed in the Bocche, including Kaiser Franz Joseph I. She was ceded to France as a war reparation after the war, but sank during a gale off Kumbor in October 1919. Her wreck was twice salvaged in 1922 and 1967.  Background  On 13 November 1883, Emperor Franz Joseph I promoted Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck to the office of vice admiral, and named him Marinekommandant of the Austro-Hungarian Navy as well as Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: Chef der Marinesektion). Sterneck's presence at the Battle of Lissa, and his past ties to Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, led to his promotion being widely supported within the Navy. After spending his first years as Marinekommandant reforming the administrative bureaucracy of the Navy, Sterneck began to pursue a new program of warship construction in the late 1880s and early 1890s. = Emergence of Jeune √âcole = alt= In the 1880s, the naval philosophy of Jeune √âcole began to gain prominence among smaller navies throughout Europe, particularly within the French Navy, where it was first developed by naval theorists wishing to counter the strength of the British Royal Navy. Jeune √âcole advocated the use of a powerful armed fleet primarily made up of cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats to combat a larger fleet made up of ironclads and battleships, as well as disrupt the enemy's global trade. Jeune √âcole was quickly adopted as the main naval strategy for Austria-Hungary under the leadership of Sterneck. His strong support for Jeune √âcole was rooted in a belief that the strategy appeared to fit existing Austro-Hungarian naval policy, which stressed coastal defense and limited power projection beyond the Adriatic Sea. Tests conducted by the Austro-Hungarian Navy during the early and mid 1880s led Sterneck to believe that torpedo boat attacks against a fleet of battleships, a central component of Jeune √âcole, would have to be supported by larger ships such as cruisers. As Austria-Hungary lacked the ability to disrupt global trade due to its location in the Adriatic Sea, and the two potential enemies the Navy could find itself at war with‚ÄìItaly and Russia‚Äìlacked suitable targets for commerce raiding or overseas colonies, the cruisers which would be designed under the principles of Jeune √âcole would instead focus on coastal defense and leading torpedo boat flotillas as opposed to commerce raiding. These tests, as well as the adoption of Jeune √âcole as the principal naval strategy of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, led to the development of Kaiser Franz Joseph I. = Proposals and budget = Under the Navy's 1881 plan which was passed by his predecessor, Friedrich von P√∂ck, Sterneck proposed the construction of a class of cruisers to the Austrian and Hungarian Delegations for Common Affairs as \\"replacements\\" for the Austro- Hungarian ironclads and . Kaiser had not seen active service since 1875 and P√∂ck had intended to have her replaced prior to his resignation in 1883. Lissa had been reassigned to the II Reserve by 1888. The Delegations strongly supported the proposal for the cruisers, in large part due to their relatively low price compared to other capital ships of the era. Two cruisers built to the specifications of Kaiser Franz Joseph I would cost 5,360,000 Guldens, while the ironclad warship , laid down in 1884, had cost 5,440,000 Guldens to construct. The Delegations thus allocated funding to construct two Kaiser Franz Joseph I-class ships‚Äî\\"Ram Cruiser A\\" and \\"Ram Cruiser B\\" (German: \\"Rammkreuzer A\\" and \\"Rammkreuzer B\\")‚Äîunder the 1888 and 1889 budgets. \\"Ram Cruiser A\\" would eventually become Kaiser Franz Joseph I. This means that Kaiser Franz Joseph Is construction costs were later recorded as being 5,146,884 Krone.  Design  alt= Authorized near the start of Austria- Hungary's second naval arms race against Italy, Sterneck had intended Kaiser Franz Joseph I and her sister ship to serve as Austria-Hungary's response to the Italian cruisers ' and . Intended as a counter to the growing strength of the Italian Regia Marina, Kaiser Franz Joseph I was designed to lead a torpedo flotilla into battle against a larger fleet of battleships. While Italy and Austria-Hungary had become allies under the 1882 Triple Alliance, Italy's Regia Marina remained the most-important naval power in the region which Austria-Hungary measured itself against, often unfavorably. Despite the Austrian victory at sea after the Battle of Lissa during the Third War of Italian Independence, Italy still possessed a larger navy than Austria-Hungary in the years following the war. The disparity between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian navies had existed ever since the Austro-Italian ironclad arms race of the 1860s. While Austria-Hungary had shrunk the disparity in naval strength throughout the 1870s, Italy boasted the third-largest fleet in the world by the late 1880s, behind the French Navy and the British Royal Navy. Sterneck hailed the Kaiser Franz Joseph I and her sister ship as the \\"battleships of the future\\", and it was envisioned that she would lead a torpedo division made up of one light cruiser, one destroyer, and six torpedo boats. The displacement and speed of Kaiser Franz Joseph I also illustrated Austria- Hungary's application of Jeune √âcole, while her prominent ram bow reflected the legacy of the Battle of Lissa, which saw a much smaller Austrian fleet defeat the Italian Regia Marina using ramming tactics. Sterneck envisioned a hypothetical engagement with the Italian Regia Marina devolving into a chaotic melee similar to the Battle of Lissa, with Kaiser Franz Joseph I and her sister ship leading torpedo divisions against their opponents. Her bow ram would maximize damage in an engagement of this sort and allow her to sink enemy vessels in a similar fashion to Tegetthoff at Lissa. Her two large guns were also chosen in order to give credence to Sterneck's plan for Kaiser Franz Joseph I to help replace heavily armored ironclads and battleships as the primary capital ship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. = General characteristics = Designed by Chief Engineer Franz Freiherr J√ºptner, Kaiser Franz Joseph I had an overall length of and a length between perpendiculars of . She had a beam of , and a mean draft of at deep load. She was designed to displace at normal load, but at full combat load she displaced . She was manned by a crew of 367 to 444 officers and men. = Propulsion = Her propulsion systems consisted of two shafts which operated two screw propellers measuring in diameter. These propellers were powered by two sets of horizontal triple expansion engines, designed to provide . These engines were powered by four cylindrical double-ended boilers, which gave Kaiser Franz Joseph I a top speed of while conducting sea trials. In order to power her boilers, Kaiser Franz Joseph I carried of coal. This gave her a range of approximately at . = Armament = Kaiser Franz Joseph I had an armament system which was based heavily off of the design of \\"Elswick cruisers\\" such as the Chilean cruiser Esmeralda. She was armed with a main battery of two K L/35 Krupp guns, mounted in turrets fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of six SK L/35 guns, mounted in casemates amidships with three on either side. She also possessed 16 SFK L/44 guns, and four torpedo tubes with two located at the bow and stern, and two located amidships. These heavy guns were intended to help the cruiser open fire on heavier battleships from a distance while supporting torpedo boat attacks on an enemy warship or fleet. In 1905, Kaiser Franz Joseph I underwent a refit for modernization. During this refit, her main battery was replaced by two SK L/40 ≈†koda guns. The mountings her main guns were located on consisted of a rotating platform and a domed gun turret. These turrets were operated by a series of steam pumps below the deck of both ships. While each turret had its own steam pump, pipes ran the length of the ship to connect each steam pump and their accompanying turret together in order to provide a backup system should one of the steam pumps be disabled in combat. The maximum elevation of the two main guns, as well as their loading angle, was 13.5¬∞. When at this angle, the range of the main guns' shells was . The maximum elevation of the ships' secondary armament was 16¬∞, and their shells had the same range as the main battery. = Armor = Kaiser Franz Joseph I was protected at the waterline with an armored belt measuring thick. The turrets had thick armor, while the thickness of the deck armor was . Her conning tower was protected by armor. The machinery for Kaiser Franz Joseph I was assembled by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, and she was constructed with a double-bottom hull and designed with over 100 watertight compartments. The steam-powered pumps used to control flooding aboard Kaiser Franz Joseph I could discharge of water per hour. The defensive systems Kaiser Franz Joseph I- also consisted of coal bunkers located abreast the boiler rooms, and a horizontal cofferdam located at her waterline, which was filled with cellulose fiber. The fiber was intended to seal up any holes in the ship from artillery rounds by swelling up upon contact with seawater, while the impacting shell itself would be slowed down by the surrounding coal, which would also serve to contain any explosions.  Service history  Kaiser Franz Joseph I was laid down by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino at Trieste under the designation \\"Ram Cruiser A\\" on 3 January 1888. \\"Ram Cruiser A\\" was formally named Kaiser Franz Joseph I when she was launched at Trieste on 18 May 1889. After conducting sea trials, Kaiser Franz Joseph I was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 2 July 1890. = Pre-war = Changes in both technology as well as naval doctrine rendered Kaiser Franz Joseph I obsolete shortly after her commissioning. Indeed, the rapid decline of Jeune Ecole during the 1890s and 1900s soon rendered the concept of \\"ram cruisers\\" obsolete as a whole. The thin armor, slow speed, and slow-firing guns present on ships such as Kaiser Franz Joseph I led to Sterneck's \\"battleships of the future\\" being labeled as \\"tin cans\\" and \\"Sterneck's sardine‚Äìboxes\\" by Austro-Hungarian sailors and naval officers. The poor reception Kaiser Franz Joseph I and her sister ship received due to these changes in technological development and strategic thinking thus contributed to the Austro-Hungarian Navy's decision to transition away from cruisers to battleships as the primary capital ship of the Navy. Within ten years of the launching of Kaiser Franz Joseph I, the first s were laid down. Despite these shortcomings, Kaiser Franz Joseph I would have a career spanning nearly 30 years. In the summer of 1890, German Kaiser Wilhelm II invited Sterneck to participate in naval exercises in the Baltic Sea. Kaiser Franz Joseph I was dispatched along with Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf and to represent the Austro-Hungarian Navy. While under the command of Rear Admiral Johann von Hinke, she visited Gibraltar and Cowes in the United Kingdom, where Queen Victoria reviewed the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The cruiser also made port in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Karlskrona, Sweden, before joining the German Imperial Navy in the Baltic for its summer exercises. Following these maneuvers, Kaiser Franz Joseph I made port in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and British Malta before returning to Austria- Hungary.  1895‚Äì1914  Throughout the 1890s, Kaiser Franz Joseph I participated in several diplomatic voyages on behalf of Austria-Hungary round the world. In 1895, Kaiser Franz Joseph I and her sister ship participated in the opening ceremony of the Kiel Canal. Two years later, she completed her first voyage to the Far East, and returned in late 1897 to participate in an international demonstration off the coast of Crete. The following year, she participated in celebrations honoring Vasco de Gama in Lisbon, Portugal. Following the end of the Boxer Rebellion, Austria-Hungary was granted a concession in Tianjin in December 1902 as part of its contributions to the Eight-Nation Alliance. It was decided after the rebellion that the Austro- Hungarian Navy would maintain a permanent presence in the Far East to guard Austro-Hungarian interests in China, as well as provide protection for the Austro-Hungarian concession in Tianjin. ' would be the first Austro-Hungarian ship stationed in China following the end of the Boxer Rebellion, while Kaiser Franz Joseph I conducted training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea throughout 1903 and 1904. While stationed in Austria-Hungary for training purposes, Kaiser Franz Joseph I underwent a refit in 1905 in order to have her Krupp guns replaced with ≈†koda guns. These guns were considered more modern than their predecessors, and had a faster loading time. Other changes included moving the location of the secondary guns to the upper deck, where they would be less exposed to the elements and have a better vantage points compared to their previous location in casemates located close to the waterline of both ships. Later that same year, she sailed for China to relieve Kaiserin Elisabeth, who underwent the same modernization upon her return to Austria- Hungary in 1906.alt= Kaiser Franz Joseph would remain stationed in China until 1908. That same year, she and her sister ship were re-classified as 2nd class cruisers and rotated duties once more, with the Kaiser Franz Joseph I being sent back to China and Kaiserin Elisabeth being transferred to Austria-Hungary to serve as a training vessel. In 1911, Kaiser Franz Joseph I and her sister ship were again re-designated, this time as small cruisers. That same year, Kaiserin Elisabeth returned to Austria-Hungary for the last time, while Kaiser Franz Joseph began her final deployment to China. During this period, Kaiser Franz Josephs crew were deployed to protect Shanghai and Austro-Hungarian interests in China during the Xinhai Revolution. In 1913, the cruisers were ordered to rotate duties one final time, with Kaiserin Elisabeth going to China, and Kaiser Franz Joseph I returning to Austria-Hungary in 1914. = World War I = alt= The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo triggered a chain of events which led to the July Crisis and Austria-Hungary's subsequent declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July. Events unfolded rapidly in the ensuing days. On 30 July 1914 Russia declared full mobilization in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia. Austria-Hungary declared full mobilization the next day. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered full mobilization and Germany declared war on Russia in support of Austria-Hungary. While relations between Austria-Hungary and Italy had improved greatly in the two years following the 1912 renewal of the Triple Alliance, increased Austro-Hungarian naval spending, political disputes over influence in Albania, and Italian concerns over the potential annexation of land in the Kingdom of Montenegro caused the relationship between the two allies to falter in the months leading up to the war. Italy declared neutrality on 1 August, citing Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia as an act of aggression, which was not covered under the Triple Alliance. By 4 August Germany had already occupied Luxembourg and invaded Belgium after declaring war on France, and the United Kingdom had declared war on Germany in support of Belgian neutrality. Following France and Britain's declarations of war on Austria-Hungary on 11 and 12 August respectively, the French Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re was issued orders to close off Austro-Hungarian shipping at the entrance to the Adriatic Sea and to engage any Austro-Hungarian ships his Anglo-French fleet came across. Lapeyr√®re chose to attack the Austro-Hungarian ships blockading Montenegro. The ensuing Battle of Antivari ended Austria-Hungary's blockade, and effectively placed the Strait of Otranto firmly in the hands of Britain and France. At the start of the war, Kaiser Franz Joseph I was assigned to the Fifth Battle Division, alongside the three Monarch-class coastal defense ships, and the cruiser Panther at the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro. Rear Admiral Richard von Barry was assigned command of this division, which was tasked with coastal defense roles. After the loss of the cruiser at the Battle of Antivari, Austro-Hungarian Marinekommandant Anton Haus blamed Barry for failing to intercept the French forces and relived him of command in October 1914, replacing him with Rear Admiral Alexander Hansa. Kaiser Franz Joseph I served as a harbor defense ship for most of the remainder of the war, though she did see action against Montenegrin batteries atop Mount Lovƒáen, which overshadowed the Bocche di Cattaro, where she was stationed. In September 1914, a French landing party of 140 men assisted Montenegrin troops in installing eight heavy artillery pieces on the slopes of Mount Lovƒáen. This bolstered the artillery Montenegro had already placed on the mountain, and posed a major threat to the Austro-Hungarian base located at Cattaro. Throughout September and October, the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Division and the Franco-Montenegrin artillery dueled for control over the Bocche. The arrival of the Austro-Hungarian s knocked out two of the French guns and forced the remainder to withdraw beyond the range of the Austro-Hungarian guns. In late November, the French withdrew and handed the guns over to Montenegro to maintain. Meanwhile, Kaiser Franz Joseph Is sister ship, Kaiserin Elisabeth would be the second Austro-Hungarian warship to be sunk during the war, having been trapped in China at the outbreak of hostilities. She was ultimately scuttled in early November at the German-held Kiautschou Bay concession during the Anglo-Japanese Siege of Tsingtao.  1916‚Äì1918  In late 1915, it was decided by Austria-Hungary and Germany that after finally conquering Serbia, Montenegro would be knocked out of the war next. On 8 January 1916, Kaiser Franz Joseph I and the other ships of the Fifth Division began a barrage which would last three days against the Montenegrin fortifications on Mount Lovƒáen. The sustained artillery bombardment allowed the Austro-Hungarian XIX Army Corps to capture the mountain on 11 January. Two days later, Austro-Hungarian forces entered Montenegro's capital of Cetinje, knocking Montenegro out of the war. After the conquest of Montenegro, Kaiser Franz Joseph I remained at anchor in the Bocce di Cattaro for the remainder of the war. She almost never ventured outside of Cattaro for the next two years.  Cattaro Mutiny  alt=By early 1918, the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several Austro-Hungarian ships at Cattaro, primarily those of ships which saw little combat. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard . The mutineers rapidly gained control of most of the warships in the harbor, while others such as Kaiser Franz Joseph I flew the red flag despite remaining neutral in the rebellion. The crews of the cruisers and resisted the mutiny, with the latter preparing their ship's torpedoes, but rebels aboard the Sankt Georg aimed their guns at Helgoland, forcing them to back down. Novaras commander, Johannes, Prinz von Liechtenstein, initially refused to allow a rebel party to board his vessel, but after the rebel-held cruiser trained her guns on Novara, he relented and let the crew fly a red flag in support of the mutiny. Liechtenstein and Erich von Heyssler, the commander of Helgoland, discussed overnight how to extricate their vessels, their crews having abstained from actively supporting the rebels. The following day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort and rejoined loyalist forces in the inner harbor after shore batteries loyal to the Austro-Hungarian government opened fire on the rebel-held Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf. Liechtenstein tore down the red flag before ordering his ship to escape into the inner harbor; they were joined by the other scout cruisers and most of the torpedo boats, followed by several of the other larger vessels. There, they were protected by shore batteries that opposed the mutiny. By late in the day, only the men aboard Sankt Georg and a handful of destroyers and torpedo boats remained in rebellion. The next morning, the s arrived from Pola and put down the uprising. In the immediate aftermath of the mutiny, Kaiser Franz Joseph Is complement was reduced to a caretaker crew while the cruiser was converted into a barracks ship. Her guns were also removed for use on the mainland. After the Cattaro Mutiny, Admiral Maximilian Njegovan was fired as Commander- in-Chief (German: Flottenkommandant) of the Navy, though at Njegovan's request it was announced that he was retiring. Mikl√≥s Horthy, who had since been promoted to commander of the battleship , was promoted to rear admiral and named as the Flottenkommandant of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.  End of the war  alt=By October 1918 it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl I decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allied Powers in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria-Hungary informed Germany that their alliance was over. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent another mutiny among the fleet. On 29 October the National Council in Zagreb announced Croatia's dynastic ties to Hungary had come to a formal conclusion. The National Council also called for Croatia and Dalmatia to be unified, with Slovene and Bosnian organizations pledging their loyalty to the newly formed government. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl I's government in Vienna asked the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help maintaining the fleet and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command. Emperor Karl I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other \\"nations\\" which made up Austria-Hungary would be able to claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time. All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being, while the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring. The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs without a shot being fired. This was considered preferential to handing the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the newly formed state had also not yet publicly dethroned Emperor Karl I, keeping the possibility of reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy alive. The transfer to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs began on the morning of 31 October, with Horthy meeting representatives from the South Slav nationalities aboard his flagship, in Pola. After \\"short and cool\\" negotiations, the arrangements were settled and the handover was completed that afternoon. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Ensign was struck from Viribus Unitis, and was followed by the remaining ships in the harbor. Control over the battleship, and the head of the newly- established navy for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, fell to Captain Janko Vukoviƒá, who was raised to the rank of admiral and took over Horthy's old responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. = Post-war = Despite the transfer, on 3 November 1918 the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending the fighting along the Italian Front. The Armistice of Villa Giusti refused to recognize the transfer of Austria-Hungary's warships to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. As a result, on 4 November 1918, Italian ships sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume. On 5 November, Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola. While the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs attempted to hold onto their ships, they lacked the men and officers to do so as most sailors who were not South Slavs had already gone home. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they also condemned Italy's actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, Italian, British, and French ships sailed into Cattaro and seized the remaining Austro-Hungarian ships, including Kaiser Franz Joseph I, which had been turned over to the National Council. At a conference at Corfu, the Allied Powers agreed the transfer of Austria- Hungary's Navy to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom. Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to hand over the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over all the ships transferred to them by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to include Kaiser Franz Joseph I, beginning on 10 November 1918. While Cattaro remained under Allied occupation after the war, Kaiser Franz Joseph I remained under the administration of France as it would not be until 1920 when the final distribution of the ships was settled among the Allied powers under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. While under French control, she was converted into an ammunition ship, but sank while moored in the Bocche di Cattaro during a heavy gale on 17 October 1919. Her sinking was attributed to several open hatches and her top-heaviness due to the ammunition stored aboard. In 1922, a Dutch salvage company discovered the Kaiser Franz Joseph I and began salvaging operations. Some of her fittings, including her deck cranes, were ultimately salvaged, though most of the ship remained intact at the bottom of the bay. In 1967, the Yugoslav salvage company Brodospas salvaged the wreck as well.

Blockchains document and confirm pseudonymous ownership of all existing coins within a cryptocurrency ecosystem at any given time through cryptography. After a transaction is validated and cryptographically verified by other participants or nodes in the network, it is made into a \\"block\\" on the blockchain. A block contains information about the time the transaction occurred, previous transactions, and details about the transaction. Once recorded as a block, transactions are ordered chronologically and cannot be altered. This technology rose to popularity after the creation of Bitcoin, the first application of blockchain technology, which has since catalyzed other cryptocurrencies and applications. Due to its nature of decentralization, transactions and data are not verified and owned by one single entity as they are in typical systems. Rather, the validity of transactions are confirmed by any node or computer that has access to the network. Blockchain technology secures and authenticates transactions and data through cryptography. With the rise and widespread adoption of technology, data breaches have become frequent. User information and data are often stored, mishandled, and misused, causing a threat to personal privacy. Currently , many are pushing for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology for its ability to increase user privacy, data protection, and data ownership.  Blockchain and privacy protection  =Private and public keys= A key aspect of privacy in blockchains is the use of private and public keys. Blockchain systems use asymmetric cryptography to secure transactions between users. In these systems, each user has a public and private key. These keys are random strings of numbers and are cryptographically related. It is mathematically impossible for a user to guess another user's private key from their public key. This provides an increase in security and protects from hackers. Public keys can be shared with other users in the network because they give away no personal data. Each user has an address that is derived from the public key using a hash function. These addresses are used to send and receive assets on the blockchain, such as cryptocurrency. Because blockchain networks are shared to all participants, users can view past transactions and activity that has occurred on the blockchain. Senders and receivers of past transactions are represented and signified by their addresses; users' identities are not revealed. Public addresses do not reveal personal information or identification; rather, they act as pseudonymous identities. It is suggested that users do not use a public address more than once; this tactic avoids the possibility of a malicious user tracing a particular address' past transactions in an attempt to reveal information. Private keys are used to protect user identity and security through digital signatures. Private keys are used to access funds and personal wallets on the blockchain; they add a layer of identity authentication. When individuals wish to send money to other users, they must provide a digital signature that is produced when provided with the private key. This process protects against theft of funds. =Peer-to-peer network= Blockchain technology arose from the creation of Bitcoin. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper describing the technology behind blockchains. In his paper, he explained a decentralized network that was characterized by peer-to-peer transactions involving cryptocurrencies or electronic money. In typical transactions carried out today, users put trust into central authorities to hold their data securely and execute transactions. In large corporations, a large amount of users' personal data is stored on single devices, posing a security risk if an authority's system is hacked, lost, or mishandled. Blockchain technology aims to remove this reliance on a central authority. To achieve this, blockchain functions in a way where nodes or devices in a blockchain network can confirm the validity of a transaction rather than a third party. In this system, transactions between users such as sending and receiving cryptocurrency) are broadcast to every node in the network. Before the transaction is recorded as a block on the blockchain, nodes must ensure a transaction is valid. Nodes must check past transactions of the spender to ensure he/she did not double spend or spend more funds than they own. After nodes confirm a block is valid, consensus protocols such as proof of work and proof of stake are deployed by miners. These protocols allow nodes to reach a state of agreement on the order and number of transactions. Once a transaction is verified, it is published on the blockchain as a block. Once a block is created it cannot be altered. Through blockchain's decentralized nature and elimination of the need for a central authority, user privacy is increased. Peer-to-peer networks allow users to control their data, decreasing the threat of third parties to sell, store, or manipulate personal information. =Zero- knowledge proofs= A Zero-knowledge proof is a Consensus decision-making protocol that one party proves to another party that information is true. The \\"prover\\" does not reveal any information about the transaction. This can be done through complex cryptographic methods. This method, which has been recently introduced into blockchain systems using zk-snarks, has been enacted to increase privacy in blockchains. In typical public blockchain systems, a block contains information about a transaction such as the sender and receivers addresses and the amount sent. Many users are not comfortable with this sense of transparency. To maintain the blockchain's nature of decentralization while decreasing transparency, zero-knowledge proofs reveal nothing about a transaction, except that it is valid.  Comparison of blockchain privacy systems  =Private blockchains= Private blockchains (or permissioned blockchains) are different from public blockchains, which are available to any node that wishes to download the network. Critics of public blockchains say because everyone can download a blockchain and access the history of transactions, there is not much privacy. In private blockchains, nodes must be granted access to participate, view transactions, and deploy consensus protocols. Because transactions listed on a private blockchain are private, they ensure an extra layer of privacy. Because private blockchains have restricted access and nodes must be specifically selected to view and participate in a network, some argue that private blockchains grant more privacy to users. While private blockchains are considered the most realistic way to adopt blockchain technology into business to maintain a high level of privacy, there are disadvantages. For example, private blockchains delegate specific actors to verify blocks and transactions. Although some argue that this provides efficiency and security, concerns that in nature, private blockchains are not truly decentralized because the verification of transactions and control are put back into the hands of a central entity, have arisen. = Hybrid blockchains = Hybrid blockchains allow more flexibility to determine which data remain private and which data can be shared publicly.Are blockchains compatible with data privacy law? A hybrid approach is compliant with GDPR and allows entities to store data on clouds of their choices to be in compliance with local laws to protect peoples privacy. A hybrid blockchain contains characteristics of private and public blockchains. Not every hybrid blockchain contains the same characteristics. Bitcoin and Ethereum do not share the same characteristics, although they are both public blockchains.  Use cases for privacy protection  =Financial transactions= After Satoshi Nakamoto spurred the creation of blockchain technology through Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies rose in popularity. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that can be used as an alternative form of payment to fiat. In current financial systems, there exists many privacy concerns and threats. Centralization is an obstacle in typical data-storage systems. Currently, when individuals deposit money, a third party intermediary is necessary. When sending money to another user, individuals must trust that a third party will complete this task. Blockchain decreases the need for this trust in a central authority. Cryptographic functions allow individuals to send money to other users. Because of Bitcoin's widespread recognition and sense of anonymity, criminals have taken advantage of this by purchasing illegal items using Bitcoin. Through the use of cryptocurrencies and its pseudonymous keys that signify transactions, illegal purchases are difficult to trace to an individual. Due to the potential and security of blockchains, many banks are adopting business models that use this technology. =Health care records= In recent years, more than 100 million health care records have been breached. In attempts to combat this issue, solutions often result in the inaccessibility of health records. Health providers regularly send data to other providers. This often results in mishandling of data, losing records, or passing on inaccurate and old data. In some cases, only one copy of an updated health record exists; this can result in the loss of information. Health records often contain personal information such as names, social security numbers and home addresses. Overall, it is argued by some that the current system of transferring health information compromises patient privacy to make records easy to transfer. As blockchain technology expanded and developed in recent years, many have pressed to shift health record storage onto the blockchain. Rather than having both physical and electronic copies of records, blockchains could allow the shift to electronic health records (EHR). Medical records on the blockchain would be in the control of the patient rather than a third party, through the patients' private and public keys. Patients could then control access to their health records, making transferring information less cumbersome. Because blockchain ledgers are immutable, health information could not be deleted or tampered with. Blockchain transactions would be accompanied by a timestamp, allowing those with access to have updated information. =Legal= The notarization of legal documents protects the privacy of individuals. Currently, documents must be verified through a third party or a notary. Notarization fees can be high. Transferring documents takes time and can lead to lost or mishandled information. Many are pressing for the adoption of blockchain technology for the storage legal documents. Documents cannot be tampered with and can be easily accessed by those who are granted permission to access them. Information is protected from theft and mishandling. Another possible use of blockchain technology is the execution of legal contracts using smart contracts, in which nodes automatically execute terms of a contract. By using smart contracts, people will no longer rely on a third party to manage contracts, allowing an increase in privacy of personal information.  Legality of blockchain and privacy  =GDPR= With the recent adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, questions regarding blockchain's compliance with the act have arisen. GDPR applies to those who process data in the EU and those who process data outside the EU for people inside the EU. Personal data is \\"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\\". Because identities on a blockchain are associated with an individual's public and private keys, this may fall under the category of personal data because public and private keys enable pseudonymity and are not necessarily connected to an identity. A key part of the GDPR lies in a citizen's right to be forgotten, or data erasure. The GDPR allows individuals to request that data associated with them to be erased if it is no longer relevant. Due to the blockchain's nature of immutability, potential complications if an individual who made transactions on the blockchain requests their data to be deleted exist. Once a block is verified on the blockchain, it is impossible to delete it. =IRS= Because cryptocurrency prices fluctuate, many treat the purchase of cryptocurrencies as an investment. By purchasing these coins, buyers hope to later sell them at a higher price. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are currentlyfacing struggles because many people do not include revenue from cryptocurrencies in their income reports. In response to these concerns, IRS issued a notice that people must apply general tax principles to cryptocurrency and treat the purchase of it as an investment or stock. IRS has enacted that if people fail to report their income from cryptocurrency, they could be subject to civil penalties and fines. In attempts to enforce these rules and avoid potential tax fraud, IRS has called on Coinbase to report users who have sent or received more than $US20,000 worth of cryptocurrency in a year. The nature of blockchain technology makes enforcement difficult. Because blockchains are decentralized, entities cannot keep track of purchases and activity of a user. Pseudonymous addresses make it difficult to link identities with users, being a perfect outlet for people to launder money. =Blockchain Alliance= Because virtual currencies and the blockchain's protection of identity has proved to be a hub for criminal purchases and activity, FBI and Justice Department created Blockchain Alliance. This team aims to identify and enforce legal restrictions on the blockchain to combat criminal activities through open dialogue on a private-public forum. This allows law enforcers to fight the illegal exploitation of the technology. Examples of criminal activity on the blockchain include hacking cryptocurrency wallets and stealing funds. Because user identities are not tied to public addresses, it is difficult to locate and identify criminals. =Fair information practices= Blockchain has been acknowledged as a way to solve fair information practices, a set of principles relating to privacy practices and concerns for users. Blockchain transactions allow users to control their data through private and public keys, allowing them to own it. Third-party intermediaries are not allowed to misuse and obtain data. If personal data are stored on the blockchain, owners of such data can control when and how a third party can access it. In blockchains, ledgers automatically include an audit trail that ensures transactions are accurate.  Concerns regarding blockchain privacy  =Transparency= Although many advocate for the adoption of blockchain technology because it allows users to control their own data and exclude third parties, some believe certain characteristics of this technology infringe on user privacy. Because blockchains are decentralized and allow any node to access transactions, events and actions of users are transparent. Sceptics worry malicious users can trace public keys and addresses to specific users. If this was the case, a user's transaction history would be accessible to anyone, resulting in what some consider to be a lack of privacy. =Decentralization= Due to blockchain's decentralized nature, a central authority is not checking for malicious users and attacks. Users might be able to hack the system anonymously and escape. Because public blockchains are not controlled by a third party, a false transaction enacted by a hacker who has a user's private key cannot be stopped. Because blockchain ledgers are shared and immutable, it is impossible to reverse a malicious transaction. =Private keys= Private keys provide a way to prove ownership and control of cryptocurrency. If one has access to another's private key, one can access and spend these funds. Because private keys are crucial to accessing and protecting assets on the blockchain, users must store them safely. Storing the private key on a computer, flashdrive or telephone can pose potential security risks if the device is stolen or hacked. If such a device is lost, the user no longer have access to the cryptocurrency. Storing it on physical media, such as a piece of paper, also leaves the private key vulnerable to loss, theft or damage.  Cases of privacy failure  =MtGox= In 2014, MtGox was the world's largest Bitcoin exchange at the time; it was located in Tokyo, Japan. The exchange suffered the largest blockchain hack of all time. During 2014, MtGox held an enormous portion of the Bitcoin market, accounting for more than half of the cryptocurrency at the time. Throughout February, hackers infiltrated the exchange, stealing $US450 million in Bitcoin. Many in the blockchain community were shocked because blockchain technology is often associated with security. This was the first major hack to occur in the space. Although analysts tracked the public address of the robbers by looking at the public record of transactions, the perpetrators were not identified. This is a result of the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions. =DAO Hack= While blockchain technology is anticipated to solve privacy issues such as data breaching, tampering, and other threats, it is not immune to malicious attacks. In 2016, the DAO opened a funding window for a particular project. The system was hacked during this period, resulting in the loss of cryptocurrency then worth $US3.6 million from the Ether fund. Due to the ever-changing price of cryptocurrencies, the amount stolen has been estimated at $US64-100. =Coinbase= Coinbase, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to store, buy, and sell cryptocurrency, has faced multiple hacks since its founding in 2012. Users have reported that due to its log-in process that uses personal telephone numbers and email addresses, hackers have targeted the numbers and emails of well-known individuals and CEOS in the blockchain space. Hackers then used the email addresses to change the users' verification numbers, consequently stealing thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from Coinbase user wallets. References Blockchains Privacy ","title":"Privacy and blockchain"},{"id":"58437070","text":"Participatory surveillance is community-based monitoring of other individuals. This term can be applied to both digital media studies and ecological field studies. In the realm of media studies, it refers to how users surveil each other using the internet. Either through the use of social media, search engines, and other web-based methods of tracking, an individual has the power to find information both freely or non freely given by the individual being searched. Issues of privacy emerge within this sphere of participatory surveillance, predominantly focused on how much information is available on the web that an individual does not consent to. More so, disease outbreak researchers can study social-media based patterns to decrease the time it takes to detect an outbreak, an emerging field of study called infodemiology. Within the realm of ecological fieldwork, participatory surveillance is used as an overarching term for the method in which indigenous and rural communities are used to gain greater accessibility to causes of disease outbreak. By using these communities, disease outbreak can be spotted earlier than through traditional means or healthcare institutions.  History  Towards the beginning of the development of Web 2.0, an increase in online socializing and interaction emerged, largely from the function of social media platforms. Social media platforms originally emerged within the context of the online information highway, where users can control what information is available to other users of the platform. Users can now digitally attach people to locations, without having to physically be within the location, a concept coined as geotagging. With added awareness of the locations of users, an aspect of greater socialization and interconnectivity emerges within both the digital and tangible world. Since the online information highway collects and stores information more permanently than the physical world, many interactions amongst online users can last much longer than physical ones. Since users can control the information and locations in which they associate themselves, they can in part surveil themselves and others to an extent. This is participatory surveillance within a web-based paradigm. In contrast to this, participatory surveillance has begun to be referred to as a tool for ecological field research. Currently, it is extremely difficult to detect disease outbreaks in enough time to prepare people for the outcomes. Often, in hard to reach areas such as the Arctic, researchers cannot gain an intensive look into the subject of disease outbreak closely enough to gain accurate results. Indigenous peoples know the ecology of the land better and how to reach overlooked locations of research. Researchers can use these people as rural surveyors, capturing instances of disease outbreak much quicker and easier than the researchers themselves.  Social media  = Counter- surveillance = Counter-surveillance refers to the personal monitoring of individuals through means of the online information highway. Through government and corporate surveilling practices, the average person has begun to develop an interest in a type of profiling of friends and others through digital technology. However, this enlightens the fact that the average person does not fully understand the surveilling practices used by larger collectivities. With more training in these capacities, it allows greater accountability and management of how surveillance is used and analyzed in everyday associations. As digital technology advances with many dangers associated to privacy, individuals are attempting to be more accountable when meeting individuals. Background check websites and search engine sources reveal just how many people attempt to find information on another person, whatever the reason. Some researchers assert that by using these technologies of surveillance, the same ones used by companies to track consumer tendencies, the public is essentially feeding into practices of their own personal surveillance. = Empowerment = One argument towards social media based participatory surveillance is participatory surveillance within social digital media schemas work to emphasize the power that comes from monitoring what is surveilled of themselves in the context of others rather than being constituted as an invasion of privacy, or disempowerment. Within the visual discourse of reality television, the artistic narrative associated with presenting lives, creates a fake reality in which people can contextualize, therefore keeping the reality of some aspects of an individual or collectives' lives still privatized. This thinking can be transposed to other socially constructed media technologies. In contrast, ambient awareness is associated with cell phones since they are rarely turned off. This poses a greater security risk. Surveillance webcams focus on the aspects of what real users want to show to the digital audience. It is privatized in the respect that users control what they allow others to see causing them to feel liberated. = Infodemiology = An emerging term within social media based participatory surveillance, infodemiology refers to the use of digital based applications or surveys, to better track disease patterns. Largely using information people search for related to health as well as what the public says on digital-based platforms makes up the fabric of this field of study. Coming about in 2002, infodemiology measures common social media platforms, disease and illness related websites, search engine information, and any other online user-related health data. Crowdsourcing based health-related sites have also been gaining traction in infodemiology. Some include Flu Near You, Influenza.net, Guardians of Health, AfyaData, FluTracking, Vigilant-e, and Sa√∫de na Copa. These sites usually gather information through mapping similar symptoms of users. Some sites, such as InfluenzaNet, provide incentives for users to continue tracking their symptoms or encourage their friends to start tracking theirs.  H1N1 virus  Twitter, a user-generated platform for social media, can effectively help track users‚Äô thoughts and opinions on diseases as well as help track disease at a greater rate. For example, the H1N1 virus (swine flu) outbreak in 2009 was analyzed through Twitter reactions and responses in order to investigate these areas of thought. After analyzing and comparing tweets through different severities of the H1NI outbreak, the researchers posited that tweets can be a reliable estimate in understanding disease patterns. The speed at which social media reveals public thought and trends is about two weeks faster than that of standardized disease surveillance through the proper health-related institutions. An example of social media reactions related to the H1N1 virus include an increased lack of discussion around antiviral drugs at approximately the same time as the H1N1 virus became less prevalent. However, due to the nature of social media as user-generated and unregulated, deciphering between what is relevant versus irrelevant material can blur generalizations and facts. Along with this, people are wavering and unreliable with when and what they post about on social media. With that, social media is an unstable variable which, in order to become standardized, would require great expense to create measures in which it would become feasible to make valid generalizations about. To elaborate using the example of Twitter, information on sickness can change meaning in a connotative sense. For example, if a user tweets about popular pop artist Justin Bieber saying they have ‚ÄúBieber Fever,‚Äù this is very apparently not a real sickness, but a faux sickness based on the popularity of an artist. This creates issues in organizing information, requiring complex algorithms that can analyze the contours of these social meanings. Nonetheless, a recent study noted that studies focusing on the use of Youtube to detect outbreaks only had a twenty to thirty percent range of error, leading researchers' to continue looking into the prospect of social media as a force for change in disease outbreak.  Chikungunya virus  Chikungunya virus, associated with moderate to severe skin rashes and joint pain, spread to Italy at the beginning of 2007. The outbreak caused great social concern, therefore causing a plethora of social media reactions to emerge. Using an infodemiological approach, the sites where the outbreak was recorded, specifically PubMed, Twitter, Google Trends and News, and Wikipedia views and edits all provided information into when the disease was received, the concerns associated with the outbreak, and popular opinion on the disease. Interestingly, most of the Twitter posts related to Chikungunya were highly guided by search engine queries rather than empirical investigations, leading to non-usable data. Using mediation technology, Wikipedia proved to be ineffective in determining whether the site was helpful in understanding the outbreak. Moreover, users who gained opinions on the outbreak from news sources were similar to the Wikipedia edits and reactions. Similarly, the PubMed responses were consistent with that of the Wikipedia and Twitter responses. Overall, a significant amount of information was gathered from these sources, deeming these sites to be useful in documenting disease and public reaction. Ecological field work =Cholera outbreak= In hard to access regions such as the Arctic and rural regions in Canada, researching ecological processes and disease spread can be hard to access without constant monitoring. In these rural, less populated area, indigenous populations may become a key aspect in understanding the spread of disease, due to their proximity and connection to the land. For example, the use of Inuit indigenous peoples in helping to identify outbreak zones of avian cholera. Specifically, the Common Eider, a species of sea duck, was being analyzed in Canada. Using the help of the Inuit peoples, the researchers were able to detect the outbreak of cholera in thirteen locations from 2004 to 2016. The Inuit peoples were able to keep a closer eye on death rates of the Common Eider due to their daily routines throughout the land. Privacy concerns As digital technology advances with many dangers associated to privacy, individuals are attempting to be more accountable when meeting others. Background check websites and search engine sources reveal just how many people attempt to find information on another person, whatever the reason. Many researchers altogether ignore the idea of privacy when analyzing methods of participatory surveillance. More so, from a social media perspective, some researchers claim that by openly sharing information with others, this cannot be deemed a breach of privacy. However, a few researchers on the topic mention breaches of privacy within the spheres of both digital media studies and infodemiology. = Infodemiology = Infodemiology relies on users' information to analyze health patterns and public health concerns. However, the legality behind using other people's information without their consent can cause serious ethical privacy violations. However, limitations such as individual privacy concerns and unreliable information cause participatory digital information to sometimes be inaccurate and hard to differentiate from truth. = Doxing = Doxing is a form of cyberbullying, using the Internet to post private information about an individual or organization as a means of attack against the entity. Common information that can be leaked can be anything from a past discretion, home address, or even social security number of the victim. This information could be freely available on the internet for the attacker to access and publicize. This differentiates it from other types of information leaks, since the information is simply being brought to the forefront of the public's viewing. In other words, the public information being leaked could be found freely by other parties even if it was not exposed in a more public light. The term \\"doxing\\" comes from the origins of document, first used in 2001 with the infamous hacker collective called Anonymous. With today's current laws, most legislation pertaining to cyber threats and attacks are rooted in the 1990s, when the Internet was just developing. Due to information being stored online, doxing does not adhere to standard rights of privacy. Constitutionally, individuals should have the right to disclose or not disclose information, while at the same time being able to make decisions about privacy. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech, but doxing uniquely uses information available to the public, leading some 'doxers' to claim that they are simply exercising their First Amendment rights. The only exception to First Amendment rights came about from Cohen v. California, which established the \\"true threat\\" exception. This exception established a breach of free speech rights whenever the content of the speech maliciously invades privacy interests. However, this exception may only work in some doxing situations, where the court measures the extent of the offense and the reactions from the attack.

The normal climbing access is from the Owyhigh Lakes Trail. The peak's name honors John Latimore Buell who arrived in Orting, Washington in 1890 and went into the hardware business.Mount Rainier National Park Place Names. Gary Fuller Reese (author), 2009. Climate Buell Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from Buell Peak drains into tributaries of the Cowlitz River.

Camden also had business connections with French Huguenots in London and was in partnership with George Lear and Peter Thellusson (also a Bank of England director) as sugar refiners.

Map of Tajikistan with Afghanistan to the south Description The border begins in the west at the tripoint with Uzbekistan on the Amu Darya. It continues along the thalweg of this river, which flows in a broadly eastwards direction, until it reaches the junction with the Vakhsh River. Hereafter the boundary continues along Pyanj river for , the surrounding area becoming increasingly mountainous as the river traces a huge horse-shoe shape, up to the confluence with the Pamir River near the Afghan village of Gaz Khun. The boundary follows the Pamir for eastwards as far as Lake Zorkul (Sir-i-kol). The boundary then goes overland for up to the Chinese tripoint, mainly following various mountain peaks and ridges. The border's eastern terminus is found at the Afghanistan-China-Tajikistan tripoint on Povalo-Shveikovskogo Peak () / Kokrash Kol Peak (Kekelaqukaole Peak; ). Much of the boundary is paralleled by Tajikistan's Pamir Highway. History The border was inherited from the old Soviet Union-Afghan border, which largely took its current shape during the 19th century Anglo-Russian rivalry in Central Asia, known as the Great Game. With the Russian Empire having conquered the Khanate of Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara, and with the British Empire controlling the British Raj, the two powers agreed to leave Afghanistan as an independent buffer state between them. In 1873 Britain and Russia agreed on a rough formulation of the border, with the Amu Darya declared to be the border going east from the vicinity of the village of Khwaja Salar to Lake Zorku, with the Wakhan Corridor to remain in Afghanistan. The western section of the border (i.e. the bulk of the modern Afghan-Turkmen boundary) was to be determined at a later date by a boundary commission. Tensions mounted as the Russians expanded further into what is now Turkmenistan in the early 1880s, reaching a crisis with the Panjdeh incident (near Sandykachi in what is now Turkmenistan), an area claimed by Afghanistan. Discussions calmed the situation and a joint Anglo-Russian boundary commission demarcated the boundary as it is today over the period 1884‚Äì87. As the village of Khwaja Salar could no longer be identified it was agreed that the boundary should meet the Amu Darya in the vicinity of Khamiab, Afghanistan. The easternmost section of the border (now forming part of the Afghan-Tajik boundary) was not finally delimited until 1893‚Äì95, with the Afghans agreeing to waive any claims to lands north the Amu Darya. This agreement also stipulated the position of the land border in section east of Lake Zorkul up to China, with a series of boundary pillars subsequently erected. In 1921 a Soviet-Afghan treaty was signed whereby Russia agreed ‚Äúto hand over to Afghanistan the frontier districts which belonged to the latter in the last century, observing the principles of justice and self-determination of the population inhabiting the same.\\" However this treaty was never implemented, and was explicitly annulled by the Frontier Agreement of 1946, which kept the boundary as it was, with riverine islands to be subsequently allocated by a joint commission. The border area was extremely volatile in the 1990s due to the Tajikistan Civil War and the Afghan Civil War. Security has improved since the end of the Tajik war and the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, however the long, porous frontier remains poorly policed and is a major drug smuggling route. There have also been a number of incidents related to the ongoing Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. Russia formerly assisted with policing it prior to 2005, and there have been recent reports that China may now be assisting with border policing.

It was founded in 2017 by Will Crutchfield, who is currently its general and artistic director. History Teatro Nuovo was founded in 2017 to continue the work of Bel Canto at Caramoor after Crutchfield and the Caramoor Summer Music Festival (where he was director of opera from 1997 to 2017) parted ways following his desire to expand the scope and offerings of the program. =Inaugural season= Teatro Nuovo presented its inaugural Bel Canto Festival in the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College in July and August 2018, performing Rossini's Tancredi, Mayr's Medea in Corinto, and a second version of Tancredi featuring the eight alternative pieces Rossini composed after the premiere, which the company called Tancredi rifatto. Like its predecessor, the program is accompanied by a multi-week training program for young singers, with a cohort of resident artists and studio artists led by a faculty that includes Crutchfield, Rachelle Jonck, Marguerite Krull, and Marco Nistic√≤. In its first season, several of the leading roles were sung by program members, joining guest soloists Jennifer Rowley, a bel canto at Caramoor alumna; Tamara Mumford; Amanda Woodbury; and Santiago Ballerini. In contrast to the Caramoor seasons, which were accompanied by the festival's resident Orchestra of St. Luke's, Teatro Nuovo formed a new 48-member orchestra playing on period instruments, seated according to the layout used at the Teatro di San Carlo of Naples in 1816, and revived the historical practice of performing without a conductor. Instead, leadership was divided between the concertmaster (Jakob Lehmann) and keyboard player (Crutchfield for Tancredi, Jonathan Brandani for Medea). This procedure has the effect of making the orchestra \\"a participating and listening ensemble, rather than an instrument to be played upon by a conductor.\\" =Second season= Teatro Nuovo expanded its offerings in its second season: Vincenzo Bellini's La straniera, Rossini's La gazza ladra, and a concert pairing Rossini's Stabat Mater with Gaetano Donizetti's Symphony in E minor. Performances in the second season again took place at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, but also within New York City at Jazz at Lincoln Center's Frederick P. Rose Hall\\"Review: A Bel Canto Boot Camp Teaches Spirit and Polish\\" by Zachary Woolfe, The New York Times, July 15, 2019 and the Church of the Heavenly Rest The critically acclaimed period-instrument orchestra returned for the second season.https://mailchi.mp/4ebdf985c8a6/teatro-nuovo-second-season During the summer of 2019, Jakob Lehmann was named Associate Artistic Director. =2020 season= For 2020, Teatro Nuovo announced revivals of Rossini's Maometto secondo and Il vero omaggio along with the modern premiere of Donizetti's Miserere in G minor in its original Viennese version of 1843. Upon the nationwide shutdown of live performances due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Teatro Nuovo announced that its planned 2020 season would be carried over to the 2021 festival. Critical reception Critical reaction to the new venture emphasized the orchestral innovations. The critic of The Wall Street Journal wrote that \\"the effect was transformative,\\" and the Financial Times headlined its review, \\"this is how it should be done.\\"  References  New York (state) opera companies Organizations established in 2017 2017 establishments in New York City ","title":"Teatro Nuovo (New York)"},{"id":"58437267","text":"Ivan Hakman (; 18 January 1955) is a former professional Soviet football defender and coach.

The film includes unscripted vignettes of ordinary Italians interacting with Massimo Popolizio (pretending to be Benito Mussolini), interspersed among scripted scenes. Plot In 2017 Rome, Benito Mussolini (Massimo Popolizio) falls from the sky in front of the Alchemical Door. As he wanders, disoriented and believing it still to be 1945, through the city, he interprets modern situations and things from a Fascist perspective. Meanwhile, filmmaker Andrea Canaletti (Frank Matano) is fired by the television station MyTV, for which he was filming a movie in front of the Alchemical Door, and despondently decides to watch the movie he had been filming for MyTV when he sees Mussolini in the background. He decides to search for him in the hope of getting his job back; after some time, he is able to find him. Canaletti and others believe Mussolini to be just a comedy actor, and he and Mussolini agree to travel together across Italy, Canaletti wishing to make a documentary that may lead him to success, while Mussolini wants to assay the Italians' mood in the hope of one day returning to power. While they are traveling, Mussolini begins to question and interact with Italians while he is filmed by Canaletti, but then there is an argument between them when Mussolini shoots a dog with a concealed pistol. Despite this, Canaletti decides to continue the documentary with him. The duo gather a lot of interest and acclaim in a short time, and finally, due to Mussolini's continuing growth in popularity and his ideas becoming accepted by more people, the ambitious Katia Bellini (Stefania Rocca), the new chairman of MyTV, decides to create a new television show dedicated to the dictator. The show becomes a boon to both Mussolini ‚Äì who continues to gather popularity and even catches the attention of foreign media - and to Canaletti, who is soon rehired and promoted. Only a few people openly criticize Mussolini's fanatical populist rhethoric and the media circus created by it, as MyTV employees caution in vain against celebrating the character that much for the sake of their show business. Soon, things begin to go wrong for the two: a MyTV executive discovers the unedited footage of Mussolini shooting the dog during his travels with Canaletti and, out for revenge against Bellini for subverting his authority, airs it during a television debate of Mussolini with Enrico Mentana. This ruins the careers of Mussolini, Canaletti and Bellini. Without dwellings or employment, Canaletti and Mussolini move, for the time being, to the house of Canaletti's girlfriend Francesca (Eleonora Belcamino), whom Canaletti was aided in seducing by Mussolini. There, Francesca's grandmother (Ariella Reggio), who survived the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome, has an argument with Mussolini; disgusted by Mussolini's ideas, Canaletti decides to distance himself from him. Outside alone at night, Mussolini gets violently beaten up by a group of masked men. At first, it appears to have been a group of animal rights activists acting in retaliation for the shooting of the dog, but the incident is then revealed to have been orchestrated by Bellini, to shift popularity from MyTV's rival TV station. Mussolini falls in love with her because she reminds him of his mistress, Claretta Petacci. In the meantime, Canaletti rewatches the recordings he made before he met Mussolini, and in them notices the supposed comic falling from the sky. Upon returning to that location, he links the occurrence to the legend of a door between the worlds of the living and of the dead, and concludes that the \\"comic\\" is none other than the real Mussolini. Taking advantage of the beating incident, Bellini manages to organize another show with Mussolini and regains wealth and success. Canaletti, however, steals a pistol from a policeman and bursts into the television studio while Mussolini's show is being filmed. He unsuccessfully tries to convince people that the man they think to be an actor is actually the real Duce. He continues to threaten Mussolini but, even though he has the opportunity to kill him, decides in the end to not shoot him because he doesn't want to lower himself to his level. Canaletti is then arrested. Completely rehabilitated by Italians, Mussolini is pardoned by the dog's owner on live television. As the film ends, it appears he is on the way to successfully using his charisma, his popularity and the media to retake political power in Italy.  Cast   Production  The film was filmed on different Italian locations as Rome, Naples, Milan, Florence and in Umbria.  Distribution  The film was released in Italy on February 1, 2018 and was distributed by Vision Distribution. Box office and reception  The film received some comments by movie critics focused on the reflection brought seeing the movie about an hypothetical return of Mussolini and Fascism in Italy. For example, Boris Solazzo of Rolling Stone said \\"[The film tells us] how much the current world is fascist, hypothesizes how Benito Mussolini, in 2018, would be accepted. Triumphantly. Like all national populists after him. And now\\". Luca Cardarelli of Cinematik said that the hardness of some scenes is a plot device used to make the viewer indignant, to encourage it to a \\"serious reflection on today's Italian civil society and mediatic society and on the actual risks of a \\"What if story\\". Maria Teresa Ruggiero of Universal Movies said \\"Luca Miniero never reveals a judgment on the figure of Mussolini, he shows it as a mask, a character that fits perfectly in the television lounge, as it happens with the participants of a reality show. \\"Sono tornato\\" seems to be more a reflection of the media parable, of how they are used today and how, the public, even forgive a homicide of dogs through a TV-truth mechanism\\". For Paola Casella of MyMovies the film lost the opportunity to be more critical towards Fascism and said \\"Sono tornato aired a month from the vote and is clearly intended as a pre-election warning. But its potential effectiveness, as comic as it is pedagogical, is thwarted by the choice (...) of never facing Fascist ideology in its danger, nor in its ridiculous component, to focus on the figure of a man who expresses himself for famous phrases: phrases that, taken out of context, can appear as pearls of wisdom. (...) In this way it is neither an antidote to History that repeats itself, nor a ridicule of certain \\"tummy reasoning\\" so popular in our day. It is not even politically incorrect enough to really make people laugh, limiting ourselves to painting our age as more confused than amoral, more solitary than egocentric, more tenderly nostalgic than tenaciously reactionary. Which, on the eve of the elections, is at least questionable\\". Raffaele Meale of Quinlan instead lamented the mediocrity of the plot and of the scenes, in particular a scene filmed inside of a Neo-Fascist circle of Rome and said \\"Sono tornato can not handle the heretical and comic potential at the same time inherent in the project, and moreover chooses positions to say the least embarrassing, as the clearance of a phantom neo-fascist party (CasaPound? Forza Nuova? Who knows, maybe a mix between the two components) in whose headquarters Matano and Popolizio go as if they could be part of a democratic path of the nation\\". For Mariarosa Mancusa of Il Foglio the movie is \\"quite depressing\\" especially because of the lack of gags in the second part of the movie and said \\"Benito Mussolini wins his television show, and boasts a remarkable following of Italians \\"when he was there\\" (trains arrived on time, Italy was respected, we had the land in the sun). They are not all nostalgic, at some age does not even allow it. They are convinced that the problems of today's Italy are identical to those of the time, and that only the strong man can solve them. Ready to take a selfie, to try a Roman salute, to be moved by a dead dog more than for the racial laws\\". The film in the first 2 weeks after the release grossed 2.2 million euros and was listed for a Nastro d'argento and after The Post and Maze Runner: The Death Cure was the film that grossed more on 1 February 2018 in Italy.

T'Kint was born in Brussels on 12 December 1816, to a family which claimed descent from the t'Kint de Roodenbekes, one of the Seven Noble Houses of Brussels. His civil service career began in 1840 in the commercial section of the ministry of the interior. In 1841 he was assigned to the project to establish a Belgian colony at Santo Tom√°s de Castilla in Guatemala.Charles Terlinden, \\"T'Kint, Auguste- Pierre-Joseph\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 25 (Brussels, 1932), 368-371. He was responsible for liaising between the Compagnie belge de Colonisation and the Guatemalan government. When the project was abandoned in 1855, he was appointed consul general to Guatemala and Belgian plenipotentiary to all the republics of Central America, with a brief to tie up loose ends left by the failure of Belgian colonisation in Santo Tom√°s, to put the relationships between the two governments on a sounder footing, and to extend Belgian diplomatic relations to other Central American countries. Between 1855 and 1859 t'Kint negotiated Belgium's first treaties of amity and commerce with Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and El Salvador. In 1859 his Rapport sur le commerce de la Belgique avec l'Am√©rique centrale was published in Brussels, and his achievements in Central America were rewarded with the knight's cross of the Order of Leopold. In December 1859 he was appointed Belgian consul general, charg√© d'affaires and plenipotentiary to Mexico, signing a treaty of amity, commerce and navigation on 20 July 1861.

It was developed to provide a more generalized framework for describing various measures of diversity, and can also be used to test various hypotheses pertaining to biogeography. Zeta diversity as an extension of other measures of diversity An illustration of the first three orders of Œ∂-diversity. =Œ±-diversity= The most basic measure of community diversity, alpha diversity (Œ±-diversity), can be described as the average number of distinct taxonomic groups (e.g. unique genera or operational taxonomic unit) present, independent of their abundances, on a per sample basis. In the Œ∂-diversity framework this can be described as Œ∂1, the number of unique taxa present in one sample. =Œ≤-diversity= Beta diversity (Œ≤-diversity) is a measure to allow for a comparison between the diversity of local communities (Œ±-diversity). The greater the similarity in community composition between multiple communities, the lower the value of Œ≤-diversity for that set of communities. Using the number of distinct taxonomic groups per community as a measure of Œ±-diversity one can then describe Œ≤-diversity between two communities in terms of distinct number taxonomic groups held in common between them. Given two communities, A and B, a measure Œ≤-diversity between both communities can be described in terms of their overlap (Œ∂2) as well as the average number of unique taxonomic categories found in A and B (Œ∂1). In the framework of Œ∂-diversity we can then describe the average Œ≤-diversity, as described by the Jaccard index, for a set of samples as frac{zeta_{2}}{2zeta_{1}-zeta_{2}} =Multi-site assemblages= The framework then for Œ∂-diversity can then be extended beyond measures of diversity in one (Œ±-diversity), or between two communities (Œ≤-diversity), to describing diversity across sets of three or more communities. If Œ∂1 describes the number of distinct taxa in community A, and Œ∂2 describes the number of distinct taxa held in common between communities A and B, then Œ∂n describes the number of distinct taxa held in common across n communities.

Shaw (June 1840 - February 1924) was an American tailor and magazine editor. Remembered as a nonconformist, Shaw was a tailor and a farmer before she became associate editor of Good Health in Battle Creek, Michigan. About the year 1870, Shaw became identified with literary work in Michigan. With her friend, Ella Farman, also a writer, Shaw purchased a small farm near Battle Creek and here, for several years, a number of juvenile books and other volumes were written, D. Lothrop & Co. being the publisher. In 1874, the initial number of Wide Awake, for twenty years the friendly rival of St. Nicholas Magazine, was edited in the sitting-room of Shaw and Farman. For two years, every number of the magazine was planned for and arranged, and the copy sent to the Boston publishers. It was the growing needs of this periodical which finally drew its founders to Boston. After Wide Awake was merged into St. Nicholas, Shaw returned to Michigan. She was a charter member of the Michigan Women's Press Association. She worked on several journals put forth by the Good Health Publishing Company of Battle Creek, where for many years she filled a responsible editorial position. Early years Emma L. Shaw was born in Junius, New York, June 1840. She lived until she was six years old, when her parents then moving to Clyde, New York. At thirteen, with her mother, she removed to Chautauqua County, new Jamestown, New York. Here were spent seven years. She lived alone with her mother, spending her time in studying and teaching, and in association with a few congenial girl friends. Though not her home, it was here she first made the acquaintance Ella Farman. Upon her mother's second marriage, Shaw accompanied her mother and stepfather to their home in Michigan, a farm in the vicinity of Battle Creek. Here, she spent a few years, during which a close correspondence was carried on between Shaw and Farman, and resulted in a proposal from Shaw that they two should found a home together. Career =Michigan= Drawn together as they had been when mere school girls by warm affection, the life of the Cary Sisters had fascinated them, and the picture given of the lovely Cary home, with its two gentle, united lives, its refined, sympathetic atmosphere, where each soul could grow to its own intellectual height under the sunny influence of the other's loving interest, had filled them both with a great longing for just such a life. Shaw and Farman resolved that they, too, would found a home. After about a year and a half of planning and preparation, they ventured, in the autumn of 1863, to leave their homes and enter upon a new, romantic life in Battle Creek, Michigan. It was harder than they expected. Both wholly impractical, they had not known just what to expect, but supposed, in a vague sort of way, that somehow they were to have the same leisure for reading and improvement to which they had been accustomed. When they found that merely to support themselves and keep together they would be obliged to sew steadily from morning till night, with little or no time for even their housework, it was a bitter disappointment. But they determined to work harder than ever, and be more economical, thus to save for a home, and to have leisure time to write as they both had literary aspirations. Shaw suggested that they should buy a cottage with a few acres of land a short distance from town with a cow, pig and poultry. Neither then nor afterward, during all their life together, did Shaw ever think or plan in any way for herself. She was so fond and proud of Farman's talent that Shaw's sole thought was to have it recognized by the world. A few years later, they moved into their own house. A gift to Shaw from a relative had helped to purchase the few acres of land, and a legacy left her by another had paid for the lumber that built the house, and bought a horse and wagon, to which they added a cow, chickens, and some garden tools. They found success using then-current agricultural methods to farm their land. Their clothing style included Turkish trousers with knee-length dresses. They lived in this farm house about eight years. The first book written, Anna Maylie (c. 1873), was prepared for a prize offered by D. Lothrop & Co., Boston. It was in the preparation of this book that they both discovered how great a help Shaw could be in literary work, possessing a literary taste and judgment of which even she herself had scarcely been aware. She looked with dismay over the first few pages of Anna Maylie, as they came from Farman's hand, burst out, \\"it cannot go like this,\\" and gave them a copyedit. Shaw now acquired a new value in the eyes of her friend, and her aid was eagerly sought in regard to both plot and detail. The succeeding books were written in this manner, A Little Woman, A Girl's Money, A Noble Life of the \\"Allie-bird Series;\\" Mrs. Hurd's Niece, and A White Hand, the last two not needing, perhaps, so much of Shaw's attention, because of Farman's experience. This gave Shaw the opportunity of doing more of the outside labor, allowing Farman time to remain in the house and write. Friends murmured, relatives grumbled and neighbors wondered why Shaw constantly did the hardest and most disagreeable work, but this was to be the time when all the literary aid and fifteen unselfish years of Shaw's life were ignored. In those days, the word collaborator was little used, and no recognition of any kind was ever given Shaw's work after the manuscripts were completed. While Farman's writing was in progress, Shaw was a \\"darling little critic,\\" and that was thought to pay for all. The six books had all been written for D. Lothrop & Co., and it was somewhere in the latter part of 1874 that Daniel Lothrop began to speak of a magazine for children, free from fairy tales, sensationalism, and everything artificial. The subject was discussed for a few months, the name decided upon, all arrangements sorted out, and in February, 1875, Wide Awake was founded in Shaw and Farman's sitting room. When Farman had been named as the editor of the new magazine, Shaw was joyful. It was hard work, the making up of this magazine so far from the center of supplies. This was felt to be so great an obstacle that in the summer of 1876, the subject of transfer to Boston, Massachusetts, began to be agitated. Though something that she felt must come some time, this news was no less a blow to Shaw. Not that there was no prospect before her also, for her friend had promised faithfully that, when Wide Awake had grown to such proportions that it would need more editorial assistance, Shaw, and no one else, should be assistant editor. Rut it was difficult to leave their home, and sell off or give away the things they had worked so hard to obtain. Yet feeling as she did, that this was the opportunity for Farman, Shaw herself urged the matter. Shaw and Farman, and Wide Awake removed to Boston in September, 1876. =Boston= But Shaw's happiness in Boston life was short lived as she could neither enjoy success nor share it. The old days of camaraderie and confidence were gone. With Farman's prosperity, their relationship changed, till nothing was left for Shaw but to put distance between herself and Farman. So closely had Shaw wrapped herself in Farman's interest, that Shaw's own personality had been obscured. Deciding to return to Battle Creek, Lothrop, who had been like a brother, tried every persuasion to induce Shaw to stay, but it was to no avail. =Back to Michigan= After Farman married in Boston, Emma returned to Battle Creek in 1880. At first, she avoided all literary aspirations. But the new life opened new vistas. New friends gathered around her and with them came new opportunities, and she returned to writing. Shaw became associated with S. Isadore Miner upon the editorial staff of Good Health, published by John Harvey Kellogg, Battle Creek, a leading hygienic and sanitary journal in the U.S. and Europe. They became good friends, but a couple of years later, Miner accepted a position with the Grand Rapids Telegram-Herald, while Shaw remained with Good Health. In 1892, Shaw suffered a long and tedious illness. During this illness, she was nursed by her companion, Mrs. J. A. Holmes. Shaw became blind in 1922 and died in February 1924.

The original layout of the school was classrooms with pillows and sofas instead of chairs and desks. Student Therapy was introduced from the start of Logos High School to help students. Eventually the school grew into a 4-year program and leased and later bought a former grade school from Ladue School District. In 1991, the school expanded to include grades 7-8 with their own separate class room. In 2008, the school expanded to include 6th grade as well. Since Logos High's inception, over 2,000 adolescents have graduated from the high school. 92% of students go to college, while 99% graduate high school. With a student-teacher ratio of 6-1, Logos High School shows itself as an alternative for students who cannot succeed in a traditional high school setting. In an interview with St. Louis Public Radio, Dr. Boyd-Fenger says many students leave after 2 years for public high schools after \\"being pointed in the right direction\\" and vigorous discussion between staff, parents and administration.

A research team in MIT proposed this concept using lithium-ion battery materials. In such a system, both positive (cathode) and negative electrode (anode) consist of active material particles with carbon black suspended in liquid electrolyte. Active material suspensions are stored in two energy storage tanks. The suspensions are pumped into the electrochemical reaction cell when charging and discharging. This design takes advantage of both the designing flexibility of flow batteries and the high energy density active materials of lithium-ion batteries.  Flow Mode and Chemistries  Two different flow modes were explored, intermittent flow mode and continuous flow mode. In an intermittent flow mode, suspensions are pumped into the electrochemical reaction cell in a batch basis and a new batch is pumped in only after the previous batch has been fully charged/discharged. In a continuous flow mode, however, the suspensions are continuously pumped through the electrochemical reaction cell during the charge/discharge process. By using lithium-ion battery active materials, the energy density of the flow battery system can be significantly improved. An aqueous system was also demonstrated besides the organic one. Other chemistries have also been explored for this system, such as sodium-ion battery, lithium-sulfur battery, and others. An illustration of a typical carbon-free semi-solid flow battery, or solid dispersion flow battery  System Developments  = Solid Dispersion Flow Battery = Despite the significant advantage of such a system, one key limitation was the high viscosity, which makes the power consumption for pumping very high and hence the energy efficiency will be decreased. Another research team in University of Virginia reported a carbon-free flow battery system. In this new system, also called Solid Dispersion Flow Battery, a new reaction mechanism was discovered with electrochemical reactions occurring based on particle collisions. =Redox Targeting Flow Battery= An illustration of a typical redox targeting flow battery Another approach is to pump the liquid phase only, leaving the solid active materials in the energy storage tanks. A research group reported redox targeting flow battery. There are redox targeting materials dissolved in the electrolyte and electrochemical reactions occur between the dissolved species. The solid materials are then been chemically oxidized or reduced. By keeping solid materials in the tanks, only the liquid electrolyte is being pumped. This saves the pumping energy although the voltage efficiency is sacrificed.

This dog breed is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club. Marcos Pennacchi (diretor editorial), Revista C√£es & Cia n¬∫ 322, Editora Forix, 2006, reportagem C√£es fora de s√©rie Veadeiro Pampeano. Members of this dog breed helped their human masters to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese \\"Veadeiro pampeano\\": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). This canine is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars. The Pampas Deerhound comes from a lineage which is different from the National Deerhound (Veadeiro Nacional), despite the similarity in the two names. Both breeds are recognized in Brazil by the SOBRACI as being distinct from each other. SOBRACI - National Deerhound standard  History  The Pampas Deerhound was originally known as Veadeiro, Cervero or Bianchini (meaning \\"whiteness, white, or pale\\" in Italian). Characteristics of this dog breed have remained stable for a long time courtesy of inbreeding program between dogs that exhibited desirable hunting traits. In 2000, thanks largely to the efforts of the late Carlos Lafaiete Seibert Bacelar, this dog breed was finally granted official recognition by the Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia (CBKC). Andrea Calmon (jornalista respons√°vel), Almanaque C√£es & Ra√ßas 2009, Editora On-Line, 2009 However, it is still not recognized by any Uruguayan or Argentinean kennel club. Currently, Brazilian breeders of this dog breed are in the process of seeking recognition from FCI. Marcos Pennacchi (director editorial), Revista C√£es & Cia n¬∫ 293, Editora Forix, 2003, reportage especial Novas Ra√ßas Brasileiras.  Origin  Origin of the Veadeiro is shrouded in mystery owing to inconclusive evidence. There are, however, two hypotheses that emerge as being the most probable. The first presumes that this dog is a descendant of a group of primitive dogs, such as Podengos or Podencos Ibicencos, which had been brought to South America when Brazil and Uruguay were Portuguese colonies. Later on these canines were taken to the Argentinian border by hunters. These primitive dogs were widely employed for subsistence hunting in rural areas. They eventually adapted to the new climate, and through cross-breeding, a new lineage originated. Selective breeding by hunters may have contributed towards the evolution of this breed and the gradual development of its traits. Studies conducted by Carlos Bacelar revealed that a family of Pampas Deerhound breeders began breeding Veadeiros for hunting from up to four generations ago. The second hypothesis is that this dog breed was a native of South America. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the dog is a common feature in several regions of Brazil, especially in the south and central-west, and also in certain parts of northern Argentina and northern Uruguay. In the pampas region of these three countries, the official name of \\"Pampas\\" Deerhound was adopted because it was believed that presence of this breed was restricted only to the gaucho pampas region and to a lesser extent in the Argentine and Uruguayan pampas. Its widespread presence was later recorded in other regions of Brazil. Most of the specimens that have been found to conform to the defined ideal standard are being identified through microchips. It is hoped that this will help create definite bloodlines formed by unrelated couples. This in turn would aid in forming the family tree of the breed which is a prerequisite to achieve the international recognition. There are some similarities between the Pampas Deerhound and the Rajapalayam dog that is native to the region of that name in India. Brazil was previously a colony of Portugal. At the same time, India had certain regions under Portuguese dominance for centuries. These formed a part of major maritime trade routes connecting the continents and, thus explaining the presence of a variation of this dog breed in Brazil.  Use as a hunting dog  While hunting, the Pampas Deerhound is a relentless pursuer that is not intimidated by obstacles. They are excellent sniffers. After identifying the trail, the canine can follow the prey relentlessly without a break, even if it takes two days to track down. After finding its prey, the dog knocks it down and brings it to the hunter. If for some reason the dog is unable to bring down its prey, it fences the target till it is within the reach of the hunter. Throughout the duration of hunting, the dog could howl, or emit different sounds for each situation: one while finding the trail, another while losing it, and yet another when it is close to the prey. This dog can hunt alone, in pairs, in packs, or with its owner. They are superb hunters, and are frequently used for hunting deer and wild boars. As they are relatively agile, they can also hunt hares and Brazilian guinea pig. Due to their ability to hunt in packs, these dogs have a quiet demeanor, CBKC - Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Cinofilia, (2010), Sergio Meira Lopes de Castro, Adonize Bonetto, Official Standard Veadeiro Pampeano. Accessed 2018. and they also make excellent companions. They are valued for being very docile and friendly with children, wherein they show patience and remain calm in the company of active children. They are also very attached to their owners and make excellent watchdogs that would alert their masters to the presence of strangers by barking. While the breed's intelligence and agility, in some cases, has been appreciated in context of activities like sheep and cattle herding, it is still regarded as having an inherent aptitude for hunting.  Appearance  Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed. The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail. The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too- marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades. The coat is singular, with the fur being short straight dense and rough, without any undercoat, and without odor. It can range from a leonine fawn color to several shades of light fawn and white, these last colors being the most common. While these colors may be solid, in some cases there may also be a small or large mark of one of these on a white coat. The canine may bear a white mark around its neck and a white mark on its chest and legs.

The first part of the name possibly comes from the old name for the local river (sk√≠rr) which means \\"pure\\" or \\"clear\\". The last part (-stad) means \\"homestead\\" or \\"farm\\". Coat of arms The coat of arms is modern and they were granted on 14 July 1991. The green arms show a silver or white millstone or grinding stone, which was used in the municipality. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Skjerstad, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Skjerstad was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

It lived between the upper Eocene and the lower Pliocene (about 35‚Äì5 million years ago). Its fossil remains have been found in Europe and Asia. Description Microbunodon, unlike most of its close relatives, was small in size and with a slight build. Its weight did not exceed 20‚Äì25 kilograms and the skull was about 20‚Äì30 centimeters long. Microbunodon was slim with long legs and a short snout with long prominent canine teeth in males, similar to a saber-toothed cat. It was characterized by a fused mandibular symphysis, with a ventral ridge-like prominence.

G. Dufour et E. d'Ocagne, Paris. from the Oligocene superior of France. The type species, Microbunodon minimum, lived in the Oligocene in Europe and is known in France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Turkey. Other species attributed to this genus are M. silistrensis (early and middle Miocene, Indian subcontinent and Indochina) and M. milaensis (late Miocene and early Pliocene, Indian subcontinent and Indochina). Other fossils attributed to this genus come from the upper Eocene of China and testify to an exceptional longevity of this evolutionary line (Tsubamoto, 2010). Microbunodon is an anthracothere, a group of artiodactyls usually considered similar to hippopotami. Microbunodon represents an aberrant morphology for this family, whose members usually have large, heavy shapes. Microbunodon and Anthracokeryx have been placed in a separate subfamily, Microbunodontinae.Lihoreau F, Ducrocq S. 2007. Family Anthracotheriidae. In: Prothero DR, Foss SE, editors. The evolution of artiodactyls. Baltimore(MD): The Johns Hopkins University Press; p. 89‚Äì105.  Paleobiology Analysis of dental wear of Microbunodon reveals that it probably had a diet based on leaves and fruit (Lihoreau, 2003). It likely lived in forest environments and had a lifestyle quite similar to that of musk deer and mouse deer. It is likely that it originated in Asia in the Eocene. At the end of the Oligocene, Microbunodon migrated to Europe and spread rapidly, along with other Artiodactyls. This event is known as the Microbunodon event, due to the significant impact that the invasion of these animals had on European fauna of the period (Scherler et al., 2013; Mennecart, 2015).

Today, many Dominicans have African ancestry, as most slaves were transported to South America and the Caribbean islands. Due to the influence of European colonization and European propagation of Africans or \\"dark-people\\" as lesser, being of African ancestry is often not desired or acknowledged in the Dominican Republic. Approximately 90% of Dominicans have some extent of African descent, however, few people self-identify as being black. According to Gates, only 4.13% of Dominicans identified themselves as black while the majority, 82% identified as \\"Indio\\". \\"Indio\\" is a term to mean in-between \\"whiteness\\" and \\"blackness\\", so not explicitly black despite the facts that many Dominicans possess physical features much more similar to Africans. In the Dominican Republic, \\"blackness\\" is often associated with being Haitian and those who possess more African-like phenotypic features are often victims of discrimination. The discrimination Haitians and Dominicans of darker skin tone endure led to the trend of Dominicans denying their African ancestry. Racial classification in the Dominican Republic In Latin America, the mechanism used for racial categorization differs quite significantly from that in North America. In North America, the one-drop rule applies in such that if a person has even the slightest degree of African blood in them then they are considered black. However, in Latin America including the Dominican Republic, there is a bit more flexibility in how people racially categorize themselves. In Latin America people identify themselves mostly based on skin color and not so much their ancestry, hence this allows for more \\"racial fluidity\\". For example, a person who has one black can identify as non-black if appearance wise they can pass of as being another racial category or racially ambiguous. Socio-economic status also heavily influences race classification in Latin America and tends to be associated with whiteness. In the Dominican Republic, those of higher social status tend to use lighter color terminology such as 'blanco/a', 'trigue√±o/a', indio/a, and claro/a to classify themselves. Discrimination against Haitians An example of racism in the Dominican Republic and the prejudice against darker-skinned people is the relations between Haitian and Dominicans. The term ‚Äúanti-Haitianism‚Äù has been coined to describe the discrimination against Haitians by Dominicans. The development of anti-Hatianism ideology can be attributed to the years of the Spanish racist mentality, racial stereotypes, and the historical propagation of dark-skinned people as the \\"inferior\\". Many Haitians have lost their lives as a result of this discrimination. The most notorious event that occurred was the massacres of Haitians in the Dominican Republic border region in 1937 under the order of former president, Rafael Trujillo. Approximately 10-20,000 men, women, children, babies and elderly, who were selected by their skin color, were massacred using machetes, guns or were thrown to sharks. While many of the people who lost their lives were Haitians who immigrated to the Dominican Republic, some were Haitians born in the Dominican Republic and those of Haitian-Dominican descent. Contemporary incidences of Dominican discrimination against individuals of Haitian descent included the mass deportation of Haitians under the premise of purifying the racial state of the Dominican Republic. Following the earthquake that impacted Haiti in 2010, two weeks after the earthquake, the Dominican Government revoked citizenship by birth from the Constitution, thereby affecting the more than 800,000 Haitians who resided in Dominican Republic at the time. As a result of the withdrawal, Dominicans of Haitian descent are denied the issuance of birth certificates at birth which is need to acquire the national ID card. Without a national ID card, these individuals are not allowed to get government documents such as passports and drivers licenses, and they are not allowed to vote or hold political presence in the country. This is a systematic way to prevent Dominicans of Haitian descent from naturalizing or integrating into the society, especially politically. Despite this lack of representation, Haitians represent a large section of labor in the Dominican Republic and are subjected to slavery-like work conditions on sugar plantation.

It formed an additional section of the former Berrima Internment Camp outside the walls of the Berrima Gaol. It was established from 1915 to 1918. The camp was also known as the Berrima PoW Camp, the German Detention Camp and the German Concentration Camp. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011.  History  =Berrima= Berrima, meaning \\"southward\\" or \\"black swan\\" in Aboriginal language, is located in the Southern Highlands of NSW, 130 kilometres southwest of Sydney. The area is associated with the Dharawal people who lived and moved through the land from Port Jackson to the Shoalhaven River to Camden, following the seasonal food supply of the area. The Wingecarribee River running through Berrima, the fertile land and native vegetation in the land around the banks of the waterway would have provided the indigenous people an abundance of water, fish and edible plants. Situated on the Hume Highway, Berrima was first settled by Europeans in the 1830s with the plan that it would become an important regional administrative centre in the State. Located on the principal road to the south of the State, Berrima was well position to fulfil this dream. By the 1850s Its population had grown to around six hundred and at its peak the town boasted thirteen inns that catered for travellers heading south or north along the major road. Berrima's prosperous times were short lived. The construction of the Great Southern Railway in the 1860s, which ran through the towns of Mittagong, Bowral and Moss Vale, by-passed Berrima and as a result the once bustling town rapidly declined. By the turn of the century Berrima's population totalled 80 and many of its buildings had been abandoned. Completed in October 1839, Berrima Gaol's ten metre high outer walls were built close to the Wingecarribee River on the south western rear side. Located through the main gates of the gaol was narrow yard and the services building consisting of the kitchens, laundry, storerooms and a small chapel. Through this building was a second larger yard with a centrally positioned tower block, with north, south and west two storey cell blocks radiating from it forming a \\"T\\" configuration and smaller corner yards. The gaols isolation cells were located in these corner yards. Most of the cells were small, 2.4m square, however there were larger cells, 2.4m x 3m that served as duty rooms for guards and the infirmary.Simons, p34 Still in operation today, Berrima Gaol is the oldest functioning gaol in Australia. The gaol was renown throughout the 19th Century as a \\"foreboding\\" place where hardened criminals were sent.http://www.app.unsw.edu.au/research-docs/Jurisdiction/NSW3.asp 2010 Flogging was common practice as was solitary confinement in the underground cells deprived of light and sound. In 1862 all convicts sentenced to five years or more by NSW courts were subjected to a year of solitary confinement at the gaol.Berrima Concentration Camp: Life on the River. Pg 231 The Berrima Gaol served as NSW's principal gaol until it closed its gates in 1909. =Berrima Internment Camp= In 1915, Berrima Gaol was reopened as an internment camp for German prisoners, serving as a satellite camp of the large Holsworthy Internment Camp at Liverpool, along with Trial Bay Gaol and a number of other facilities in the State. With the declaration of War in 1914, people of German origin and German property immediately became the \\"enemy\\". As Germany had a number of colonies in the South Pacific, there were quite a number of merchant ships in the ports and German shipping vessels in various Australian harbours at the time of the declaration. As a result, the ships were seized by the Australian Armed Forces while in port and German passengers and crew were detained. Other merchant ships were captured offshore by the Navy. Based on the British Government's concentration camp model during the Boer War (1899-1902), the Australian government adopted the principal by setting up concentration camps in each of the six States to intern the \\"alien enemy\\". By early 1915 there were almost 3,000 German internees in Australia. In order to aid communication between camps, to cut costs and to standardise the rules in terms of the treatment of prisoners, the concentration camps were closed in all States other than New South Walesand all internees were transferred to facilities within New South Wales. It was a long and unpleasant journey for many internees who travelled to New South Wales, some were handcuffed and some were treated roughly by officials. There were some internees who were granted reprieve from being detained in the camps. They were allowed to live in the community providing they observed conditions of their parole such as reporting to the authorities on a regular basis. Holsworthy Internment Camp was the major camp to receive the large influx of internees who were being transported from region camps across Australia. There were also Department of Defence internment camps in Bourke in western NSW and Molonglo in the ACT. Two other sites, Trial Bay and Berrima Gaols were set up as satellite camps in early 1915. Berrima Concentration Camp was to be predominately for ships officers and sailors, and Trial Bay camp mainly held German internees of prominent social standing such as businessmen and professionals. The structure of Concentration Camps at the time was based initially on the British code of instructions \\"Royal Warrant\\", of August 1914. The constraints of the daily lives and treatment of the internees was later based on the Australian \\"Rules for the Custody of and Maintenance of Discipline among Prisoners of War in NSW\\". It outlined the compulsory requirements such as twice daily roll call, rising and sleep and meal times. It also stated that an elected Internee Camp Committee would look after the \\"general welfare\\" of the internees and that Committee was to report to the Camp commandant. Under this main committee sat various other sub committees whose job it was to deal with various aspects of life in the camp such as recreation, theatre and music, kitchen services, education and other aspects. Arriving by train to Moss Vale and then on foot along the long and rough road, the first group of 89 German internees arrived at Berrima in March 1915. The Defence Department had done little to the gaol in preparation for its \\"new arrivals\\" other than clearing away the rubbish, making the buildings secure and building an observation platform and a small weatherboard hut for the Camp office. It was the condition of the gaol upon arriving that the internees named the place \\"Ahnenschloss Castle of Foreboding\\". They had no personal items as their luggage had not arrived, the prison cells that were to be their home were mostly empty of furniture and other than a very few provisions like two blankets, the makings for a mattress, and eating utensils, the internees had very little in the way of comfort. Food was supplied, however the internees had to prepare and cook their own food.Simons, p29 The majority of German internees to arrive at Berrima Camp were German merchant mariners, however a minority of internees were prisoners of war from German colonies in the region and other men captured from the German Imperial Navy cruiser SMS Emden. A large proportion of the internees were middle to high-ranking merchantmen, including first officers, chief engineers and captains. Otto Pahnke and Robert Martens held very senior positions as senior supervisors of NGL and HAL lines. From photographs, Simons points out that photographic evidence suggests that these ranks were still observed at the camp level. Part of Germany's Pacific fleet, SMS Emden was quite an infamous Naval cruiser that had many an Allied warship in search of it soon after outbreak of war. Captained by Fregattenkapitan Karl von M√ºller, the Emden captured many Allied merchant mariners and either took over their vessels or sank them. Having carried out an impressive action and successful raid on Penang in the Battle of Penang where the SMS Emden sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug and the French destroyer Mousquet, the cruiser steamed off to the Cocos Islands to destroy an important cable wireless communication station linking Australia with the rest of the world. A convoy of Australian and New Zealand warships heading to Colombo picked up wireless activity from SMS Emden and HMAS Sydney's English Captain Glossop gave the order for his vessel brake away from the convey to deal with the legendary cruiser. Shells were fired from both vessels but the Emden was no match for the Sydney which eventually set the Emden on fire and blew away its control tower, bridge and severely damaged its steering. One hundred and thirty six of Captain von Muller's crew were killed and a further sixty-five badly injured before the Emden finally ran aground on a reef of Windward Island in the North Keeling Group. In the publication Prisoners in Arcady - German Mariners at Berrima 1915-1919, Simmons noted that the Emden men interned at the Berrima Concentration Camp included Chief Engineer Walter Bergien, Engineers Gerhardt Freund and Otto Fisher, Navigator Otto Monkeskieck and Bosun Karl Muller. Martin Meyer, also interned at Berrima was a young reservist who joined the Emden crew as vice navigator and soon after promoted to Lieutenant but was not on the vessel during its last days. This was the case with Bergien, Monkedieck and Muller. Daily life for the internees at Berrima Gaol was structured around morning roll call and evening roll call at 5pm. Between these two defining events, the internees were free to wander within a two-mile radius of the gaol and were locked up during the evening. Berrima's small population doubled with the arrival of the \\"enemy aliens\\" and the guards. The sleepy town once again began to prosper, playing an important role in providing services to the \\"new arrivals\\". The internees bought food, such as bread and meat and other supplies from the village stores. Relations between the townspeople, new and old, were relatively harmonious. The vast majority of the internees spoke some English due to their maritime background and could converse relatively well with the local people. Berrima also played host to families of the internees. They rented houses in the village and there began more interaction with the community, with internees often helping out in the community where needed. A school was set up in a slab hut for the children as evidenced in a photograph showing children, teacher and a sign \\"Tochterschule Berrima 1917\\". The Winagecarribee River played an important role in the daily lives of the internees, providing many opportunities for swimming, fishing and boating along its course. The River winds its way through the Moss Vale and Berrima, around the cliff face below the rear of the town's gaol and then flows eleven kilometres downstream. The bank of the river was reasonably heavily wooded in 1915 with native shrubs and grasses as well as tea trees. Platypuses were plentiful in the river up until the 1940s when the exotic Willow took over the banks of the river. Wide, deep water pools also were a feature at various points along the twisting waterway. One such pool was located just downstream from the gaol. This area was a popular swimming hole for not just the internees but also the villagers and the many visitors to Berrima. The internees named this pool Grosse See, meaning Great Lake and being close to the gaol, it was a major place of activity for them. A half kilometre west from this water hole was another deeper wider pool that the internees used extensively. This pool was given the name Lake Titicaca.Simons , p35 To provide better water-based amenities for themselves the internees turned their hand at altering the waterway. From local rocks and clay they constructed a dam downstream from Lake Titicaca which raised the water levels in the water hole and the river upstream from it by one metre. Damming the river was a plan that the villagers had hoped that the Administration would have embarked on for many years previous to the construction by the internees.Simons, p46 Utilising the river for swimming was an instantly popular recreational activity amongst the internees. They swam from the sandy beaches in the river's coves and erected diving platforms around the deeper water holes. Boating was also a big feature of life on the river with Venetian carnivals being held along with competitive water sports and other such events. Being experienced seamen, the idea of building a boat was not a daunting task. Simple canoes were constructed as well as fleets of elaborately built and decorated rowing and sailing boats. One notable carnival reported in the local newspapers was a \\"mock battle\\" staged by the Berrima Guard, where two watercraft representing the SMS Emden and HMAS Sydney fought it out on the waters of Lake Titicaca close to the Hansa Bridge. The carnivals were usually held on culturally important days, such as the birthdays of German royalty. The river environs were significantly important for the internees well being. To escape the confined spaces of the gaol that they suffered during the evening, many of the industrious internees soon after arriving at Berrima, constructed simple small huts from tea trees in the area. Brushwood branches and foliage were either tied or woven together to form the walls and roof. These initial huts, mainly constructed on the right side of the bank between the dam and Lake Titicaca, served both as private places during the day time and also as shade structures during hot or windy weather. To take advantage of the area along the left bank of the river which was sunnier, less rocky and boasted more fertile soils the internees designed and constructed a bridge across the river. Studying the rivers varying low and high-level marks, the mariners chose to construct a high-level bridge above the general flood level around the area in line with Oxley Street on the right bank and just downstream from the water hole known as the Great Lake. Constructed in three months from local timbers the bridge was officially opened in July 1915 and named Hansa Bridge. The naming of the bridge is significant in that it makes reference to the shipping company HANSA line and pays homage to the maritime history of the Hanseatic League and the confederate cities of north Germany 1260‚Äì1600.Simons, p47 From photographic evidence, John Simmons wrote that there may have been a second bridge built next to Lake Titicaca's dam wall. Simmons also noted that a few weeks after the opening of the bridge the internees constructed a large waterslide 30 metres upstream from the new bridge on the right bank that was reminiscent of an \\"American style water chute\\".Simons After the bridge was constructed more huts were built, mostly on the left bank downstream from the Hansa Bridge. Some were simple brushwood and bark structures, others were built from galvanised iron sheets or flattened kerosene tins. Several more elaborate huts and cabins were constructed. One particular cabin of importance was Alsterburg, that was elaborately constructed from logs and was reminiscent of Germany's Black Forest cabins in design. The huts and cabins were given names and tended to be grouped as in small villages. Realising that the war was to continue for some years and with having experienced Berrima's cold winter months, some of the huts were extended and improved. Also many more internees took to building huts with the peak construction period being the summer of 1916/17 with several resembling a European summer villa or lodge using eucalypt logs. One such cabin was built by NGL officers Rudolf Carstens and Richard Preiss, who also turned their hand to performing in the internee's theatre productions. Most huts housed just a few men, however there were huts that served as clubhouses, such as the Sorgenfrei (Carefree), which was the Swimming Club. Another communal hut, the Lloydhalle 2, was for the use of the younger men from the NGL Line.Simons, p90 The cultural lives of the internees were enriched by regular theatrical and musical performances by fellow internees. A stage platform was built in a natural amphitheatre area just downstream from the first bend of the river on the left bank side. Another important enhancement was the building of a bakehouse not far from the amphitheatre where German-style pies, cakes and pastries were made and sold. The Bakehouse was built by Henrich Bartels from the HANSA line. A particularly successful entrepreneurial undertaking by the internees was the establishment of vegetable gardens. From its small beginnings during the first year, by 1917 the vegetable plots had grown from a few small gardens within the gaol and just outside the gaol to the establishment of impressive plots around the huts on the riverbanks. The produce was sold to the camp's kitchen and if there was an oversupply, the internees also sold the produce to the villagers. Such was the success of this enterprise that soon the internees with an agricultural bent rented local fields and some of the old orchards in Berrima and set to work on preparing the land for large crops of vegetables and fruit. Word spread quickly beyond Berrima about what the Germans or \\"Huns\\" were creating and soon many visitors started arriving in Berrima to witness the Germanic structures that were created and how they lived. With the curiosity of the visitors also came vandalism and antagonism. Some resented the perceived privileges that were afforded to the \\"Huns\\". As a result, a high wire fence cordoning off an area of up to 20 acres on the left bank of the river for use by internees only was constructed to provide more privacy and protection for the internees. It became necessary for the internees to patrol the areas that they recreated to safeguard the watercraft and huts that they had built. Hostility by the local residents towards the internees also grew as the attitude of wartime hysteria increased. Between 1915 and 1919 up to 400 Germans were interned at Berrima. After spending four years living as \\"enemy aliens\\", a formal declaration was finally signed by Germany that officially ended WWI in June 1919. Although an armistice was called for and received, German internees in Australia had to wait months until they could be repatriated when this official declaration was signed. The first group to be repatriated was prisoners of war. This included a small group of internees from the Berrima camp. The remaining internees had to suffer many weeks of postponement and changing regulations as to their departure details and allowances. Adding to their growing frustration about the delays was the news that a monument to commemorate the deaths of four German Trial Bay internees had been vandalised and then completely destroyed. This prompted a reaction of the Berrima internees to leave nothing of their works behind, including huts and watercraft. They immediately retaliated by sinking their watercraft, digging up their garden beds and burning their huts. On 12 August 1919 the remaining internees loaded the waiting wagons with their most treasured possessions and were marched through Berrima towards Moss Vale where they were to be transported by train to Sydney. Here they boarded SS Ypiranga bound for Rotterdam and finally transported back home to Germany.  Description  The Berrima Internment Camp Huts Area includes 42.66 hectare section of bush and pastureland along the north and south banks of the Wingecarribee River downstream of the Berrima Gaol. It also includes a section of the river. It was here that the Germans interned at the gaol built a large complex of huts and other items such as watercraft, boatsheds, mooring posts, jetties and bridges to facilitate their daytime activities while in detention. These activities included gardening, picnicking, pursuing sporting and water related activities such as boating and swimming, rehearsing plays and musical performances or just relaxing. There were thought to be approximately 14 huts on the northern side of the river and around 27 huts located on the southern side of the river. Initially the huts were constructed of brush and were not much more than a primitive shelters located on the banks of the Wingebarribee River. As the war lengthened and the internees became resigned to a long stay in the camp they began to construct more substantial structures of timber slab and/or bark with rubble stone foundations. The gaps between the timber slabs or bark slabs were plugged with termite mud. The rooves of some huts were thatched with grasses, which as could be expected, did not guarantee a waterproof abode. Other huts used bark or timber slabs or scavenged corrugated iron for roofing materials. Some internees made elaborate, European style cabins out of eucalyptus logs, once again plugged and internally lined with termite mud. The more substantial huts were located further back from the river and often were situated to capture the most attractive views of the river. These sturdy cabins and villas often required significant amounts of money to purchase materials. Other internees possibly with fewer financial resources used their ingenuity to design and construct houses out of materials at hand such as flattened kerosene tins or found sheets of galvanized iron. One hut was constructed completely from bundles of newspapers, which surprisingly lasted a number of years after the camp was disbanded. Another was constructed of \\"10,100 clay-filled jam and milk tins\\".\\"Prisoners in Arcady\\" Exhibition Text, Berrima Museum At the end of the war prior to being repatriated and in response to the news that locals had desecrated the German memorial at Trial Bay, the Berrima internees determined that they would destroy their hand crafted watercraft and huts. While some of these artefacts were destroyed at the time a number of the huts remained intact for a number of years. Some of the watercraft had been sold to locals and one that had been sunk was discovered in 1978, buried in a sandbar (Cosmos Archaeology, WWI German Built Watercraft on the Wingecarribee River. Archaeology Impact Assessment). There is evidence of further watercraft (up to 13 in total) in the bed of the river. The listing also includes a collection of associated moveable heritage located at the Berrima Museum and at the Berrima District Historical Archives in Mittagong. Moveable heritage items include: * Carved Box -18 * Gaol Cell Door s * D.A.D.G. Banner * Dolls House -19 * Framed memento of 20th Berrima Guard April 1916 * German Merchant Officer's Service Record Book 1909 - 1915 * Serviette Rings 1916 * Carved Wooden Shield May 1916 * Carved Wooden Shield * Dugour Canoe * Concert Zither * Collection of historic photographs of the Internees and their activities on site circa 1915-1919  Condition  Evidence of the huts that remain on site includes numerous stone rubble platforms and retaining walls on which huts would have been constructed. A number of these are located on the northern side of the river, both on the banks close to the water and further back commanding picturesque views of the river. During a site visit at least 10 potential sites were identified and it is expected that more could be identified on an intensive and methodical inspection. A typical example of these foundations located on the site visit was that of Alsterberg Hut which as well as the rubble foundation platform (approx 4x6 metres) has a set of steps carved in rock leading to the porch area and evidence of stone rubble retaining walls. As well as these foundation sites there are also a number of natural rock platforms with evidence of fixings or postholes for huts. These are located on both the northern and southern banks of the river. In addition an item that is likely to have been a mooring post is located on the southern bank of the river approaching Lake Titicaca, a large pool in the river where it bends to turn north upstream of the internee constructed dam. On the southern banks of Lake Titicaca is located a pile of bricks that have been disturbed by wombat activity. In addition to the huts, moorings and jetties the internees built a bridge across the river that they named Hansa Bridge. It was located directly south of the end of Oxley St on the northern side of the river and spanned the river to a continuation of Oxley St which no longer exists although is evident in maps of the town layout. No evidence of the bridge was uncovered on the site visit but archaeological evidence may exist. The remains of the huts foundations are extensive and many are easily identified in the landscape.  Heritage listing  The Berrima Internment Group is of state heritage significance for its unique historical values as a place where German Mariners were interned between 1915 and 1919 during the course of WWI. The remains contained in the precinct, including those of the huts, recreation facilities, submerged watercraft and moveable heritage associated with the site, clearly tell the story of the lives of those internees and their efforts to retain cultural identity and practices during their period of confinement. The precinct provides a tangible link to an important phase of Australian history and demonstrates how Australians regarded and dealt with enemies of the British Commonwealth and also demonstrates Australia's relationship with Britain at the time. Being the site of internment for German sailors and Naval personnel it demonstrates the way in which classes of \\"enemy alien\\" were segregated as a matter of government policy. In addition to the historic values of the place its State heritage significance in enhanced through its association with crew of the SMS Emden and its archaeological research potential will provide a wealth of information on the method of construction of the huts, the layout of the precinct including gardens, the lifestyle and customs of the large group of \\"enemy aliens\\" interned at Berrima during World War I. The Huts Precinct is a rare and representative example of a recreation area constructed by German Internees while confined in an internment camp during WWI. It is also to only camp in NSW to exclusively house German Mariners detained during WWI. Berrima Internment was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Berrima Internment Camp Huts Area is of state heritage significance for its historical values as a place where \\"enemy aliens\\" were interned between 1915 and 1919 during the course of WWI. The remains of the Huts Precinct including the foundations of huts, boat sheds, jetties etc. comprise a cultural precinct established in the Australian bush around the Wingecarribee River, Berrima which tells the story of the lives and occupations of the German internees while confined. This historic landmark with its archaeological remains reveals the unique lifestyle of this group of people and their determination to retain and express their cultural identity and practices while confined as \\"enemy aliens\\" in Australia. The area provides a tangible link to the an important phase of Australian history and demonstrates how Australians regarded and dealt with enemies of the British Commonwealth and also demonstrates Australia's relationship with Britain at the time. A significant part of this story is demonstrated by the way in which relations between the Internees and villagers changed during the course of the war. It appears that the internees initially at least seemed to be relatively integrated into the community as they were free to wander in a 2-mile radius of the gaol and purchased goods from local shops and often lent assistance to locals. This seemed to change as the numbers of internees grew and the conflict in Europe was prolonged. Being the site of internment for predominantly sailors and Naval personnel it demonstrates the way in which classes of \\"enemy alien\\" were segregated as a matter of government policy. The largest of the camps, Holsworthy Internment Camp was a centralised camp where Germans from all over Australia were interned. From there those Germans of the business and professional class and those from other British Territories were sent to Trial Bay Gaol, German Mariners were sent to Berrima Internment Camp, families were sent to Bourke, and others were sent to Molongolo. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The significance of the Huts Precinct of the Berrima Internment Camp is enhanced through its association with a number of the crew of the notorious German Merchant Navy ship, the SMS Emden. Under the command of the ingenious and daring Captain von Muller, the SMS Emden inflicted a great deal of damage to allied merchant shipping during the early months of the war. Its activities were finally curtailed by the Australian naval vessel, HMAS Sydney on 9 November 1912. Seven of the Emden crew who were injured during capture were interned at Berrima Internment Camp for the duration of the war. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Huts Area at the Berrima Internment Camp is of aesthetic significance at a State level as it shows evidence of a unique cultural precinct with a notably European layout and design, similar to the summer houses of continental Europe, set in the Australian bush at Berrima. In Europe at that time it was a common practice to establish \\"summer houses\\" complete with plot of land for growing vegetables and flowers. While the huts no longer remain, the ruins, foundations, platforms, cellar and other remains contribute to a visually distinctive natural and cultural landscape on the banks of the Wingecarribee River. . The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The heritage significance of the Berrima Internment Camp Huts Area at a state level is enhanced through its importance to the German community in NSW. The place tells an important story in this group's history in NSW and Australia. The place also has a special association with the local Berrima Community and descendants of those who resided there between 1915 and 1919. The story of the German internees and the interaction between residents and the internees at Berrima is an important part of their own local history that is intertwined with the larger history of NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The place is of State heritage significance for its large archaeological resource which will, on further investigation, provide a wealth of information on the method of construction of the huts, the layout of the precinct including gardens, the lifestyle and customs of the large group of German \\"enemy aliens\\" interned at Berrima during WWI. It will contribute significantly to the understanding of this group of people, their experience and determination to maintain their cultural identity and practices in NSW during their wartime confinement and to our understanding of the wartime history of NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The remains contained in the Huts Area at the Berrima Internment Camp is of State heritage significance as evidence of a rare and unique example of a European summer house style collection of huts, gardens and infrastructure to facilitate water-based and other activities established by a group of German Internees during WWI. The village of huts and the activities carried out there ensured that the group maintained and expressed its German identity. While at other camps such as Trial Bay Gaol the German internees constructed shelters and items to facilitate the passing of time and expression of culture, the land area utilised and facilities constructed were not as extensive as those in Berrima and the remains are not as intact and indicative of the original layout. Its rarity values extend to the fact that Berrima was the only WWI Internment Camp to house German mariners with a large percentage of these being of the middle to high level ranks. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The remains of the Huts Area at Berrima Internment Camp are representative of a recreation precinct built by WWI German Internees during their confinement in a NSW German Internment Camp. The intactness of its archaeological remains demonstrate the principal characteristics of a village modeled on the idea of the continental European summerhouse, where householders from urban areas leased or owned small plots of land on which they built \\"summerhouses\\" and tended vegetable and flower gardens.

It was built in 1886 by R. N. Matthews. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Berrima is the second oldest European settlement in Wingecarribee Shire and the oldest continuing settlement in the shire. The first town settlement in the district was in 1821 at Bong Bong, 8 km south-east of Berrima on the Wingecarribee River. The site of Berrima was selected by Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1829 on a visit planning the route for a new road alignment from Sydney to replace the old Argyle Road, which had proven unsatisfactory due to a steep hill climb over the Mittagong Range and river crossing at Bong Bong. In 1830 Mitchell instructed Robert Hoddle to mark out the town based on a plan Mitchell's office prepared, along the lines of a traditional English village (with a central market place and as many blocks as possible facing onto the WIngecarribee River), and using the local Aboriginal name. The new line of road came through the town.> Berrima was to be established as the commercial and administrative centre for the County of Camden. Following the approval of Governor Bourke in 1831, the period 1824 to 1841 saw significant flourishing development as mail coaches changed their route to this new line of road. Early town lots were sold in 1833, predominantly to inn keepers and around Market Square, including the first town Lot sales to Bryan McMahon. Governor Bourke designated Berrima as a place for a courthouse and gaol to serve the southern part of the state. With construction of the gaol from 1835 to 1839 and its courthouse in 1838 to serve the southern part of the state the town flourished into the 1840s as mail coaches called, public buildings including churches in 1849 and 1851, establishment of many hotels and coaching houses to service local resident needs and passing trades, persons and commercial travellers. Its 1841 population was 249, with 37 houses completed and 7 more in construction. Research has indicated there were some 13 hotels or grog houses in Berrima at the one time in the early days before the coming of the Southern Railway to the Moss Vale area, which by-passed Berrima. There is some doubt about the early days of the Berrima Post Office. Apparently the Berrima Office was moved from Bong Bong in June, 1838. A post office was opened at Bong Bong at least as early as 23 December 1829. John Lowe, Clerk to the Chamber of Magistrates, was given the responsibility of looking after the post office. Between 1830 and 1837 a number of people filled the job as postmaster. Records state that James Higgins was appointed postmaster at Berrima 1 June 1838. It would appear that the office was moved from Bong Bong to Berrima on that date. There is very little known of the Berrima Post Office from about 1840 to 1860. The 1851 census showed the number of buildings remained the same, but the population had dropped to 192. During the 1850s Berrima experienced another boom period after the discovery of gold. When the Great Southern Railway bypassed Berrima in 1867, the town again began to decline as Mittagong, Moss Vale and Bowral developed. Berrima remained virtually unchanged for the next 100 years, preserving the town as an almost intact colonial village. On 6 September 1858 the Berrima telegraph station was opened and in 1860 a building was bought for use as the telegraph station. At this time the Postal Department and Telegraph Department had no connection at all with one another. The Berrima Post Office occupied several premises until the 1880s. In 1883 the post office was located in the Glad Tidings building. The telegraph office was nearby. The telegraph business was now being carried on over a telephone line probably to Moss Vale. This was strongly objected to by the residents for the reason that the telephone system was then in its infancy and shouting into the receiver was necessary. Anyone handy to the post office could hear every word. In June 1881 a petition was received from Berrima residents asking for the provision of a new post office. It was suggested that an ideal site would be land owned by the Government, where the old Toll Bar used to be. It was also pointed out that the Commercial Bank authorities were about to build a new bank nearly opposite the site. The Postal Department approved the erection of a new post office on the old Toll Bar site, but finance was not available and the matter was shelved. As a result of further resident agitation and the dilapidated condition of the then post office building, the tender of R. N. Matthews & Sons was accepted 22 April 1886 for 777 pounds. The Berrima Post Office was erected on the earlier \\"Old Tollhouse\\" or Tollbar site. The postmaster was moved into the new office on 17 August 1887. It was not until 1890 that the block of ground, being Lot 19 of Section 2, was transferred to the Postmaster- General. Because of the decline of revenue, Berrima was made a semi-official office and Mrs C. Reynolds took charge of it on 9 January 1909. On 1 March 1912 she was succeeded by Mrs B. Walker. A weatherboard wing was added 1930s. In 1988, a new building was constructed at the rear of the post office. The post office was restored at that time, with internal modifications made. The building continues in use as a post office, and now also incorporates a gift shop and modern three-bedroom residential unit. In late 2019, the Post Office (store) moved out of the building to new location next to the general store, located north and opposite the goal.  Description  Berrima Post Office is a painted brick building with stone foundations. It has a corrugated iron roof and features a verandah to the front of the building. It was reported to be in good physical condition at the time of its heritage listing, with low archaeological potential.  Heritage listing  The Post Office is located on the site of the earlier \\"Old Tollbar\\". The post office is situated on a prominent corner site in the town of Berrima. It makes an important contribution to the historic precinct of Berrima. Berrima Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Early town lots were sold in 1833, predominantly to inn keepers and around Market Square, including the first town Lot sales to Bryan McMahon. Governor Bourke designated Berrima as a place for a courthouse and gaol to serve the southern part of the state. With construction of the gaol from 1835 to 1839 and its courthouse in 1838 to serve the southern part of the state, the town flourished into the 1840s as mail coaches called, public buildings, including churches in 1849 and 1851, establishment of many hotels and coaching houses to service local resident needs and passing trades, persons and commercial travellers. Its 1841 population was 249, with 37 houses completed and 7 more in construction. Research has indicated there were some 13 hotels or grog houses in Berrima at the one time in the early days before the coming of the Southern Railway to the Moss Vale area, which by-passed Berrima. Berrima had been established 18 years before it had a church in which its residents could worship. A subscription list for erection of a church was opened in May 1841, but it was another 4 years before the people of Berrima were ready to consult architect Edmund Blacket about the design of Holy Trinity Church. Blacket found his way to Berrima from Southwark, Surrey, where he was born in 1817. He left England in 1842 to build his own career, stopped over in Sydney on his way to New Zealand, and was eventually appointed Colonial Architect of New South Wales. A self-trained architect, he designed 58 churches, including St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney. Holy Trinity was built by William Munro for A‚Ç§900. The foundation stone for the church was laid by the Anglican Bishop William Broughton on 7 April 1847 and consecrated on 9 June 1849. The church is built of local sandstone quarried nearby. The church is one of the first designed by Edmund Blacket in the simple Victorian Gothic Revival style. The design for Holy Trinity was modelled on the 15th-century church of St Peter in Biddestone, Wiltshire. A plan of St Peter's appears in Augustus Pugin's \\"Examples of Gothic Architecture\\" 1840. Holy Trinity is considerably larger than St Peters, and Blacket modified the design and added numerous details such as the Perpendicular Gothic elements in the chancel arch, the east and west windows and the open timber hammer beam roof. Stained glass windows are a feature, most over 100 years old. The two on the right-hand side of the entry door are believed to be over 200 years old. With its setting on a hilltop of pines Holy Trinity is one of Berrima's landmarks. The 1851 census showed the number of buildings remained the same, but the population had dropped to 192. During the 1850s Berrima experienced another boom period after the discovery of gold. When the Great Southern Railway bypassed Berrima in 1867, the town again began to decline as Mittagong, Moss Vale and Bowral developed. Berrima remained virtually unchanged for the next 100 years, preserving the town as an almost intact colonial village. The church hall was built over 100 years ago.Davies, 2004 The church was rededicated in 1957 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. The stained glass windows are reputed to be over five hundred years old and imported from the United Kingdom. It has received federal heritage funding for of $85,850 for conservation work.  Description  =Site and grounds= The site consists of the church and a later utilitarian timber weatherboard church hall to its north nearer Argyle Street. More than half the site is covered with scrub and maritime pine forest (Pinus pinaster) to the east and south, a significant proportion of this area also slopes steeply towards the Wingecarribee River. The sections of the site that are accessible but that are outside the fence line form part of the parkland surrounds of the site. The neighbouring site to the south has recently been cleared of trees in an attempt to clear the flow of the river. Within the fenced area, the southern part of the site is a wide expanse with few trees, a level cleared area with sandstone outcrops at the surface throughout. The northern part of the site is dominated by an extensive sandstone outcrop, which incorporates a significant change in level, and a relatively dense cover of mature trees. Trees in the grounds include some rare and unusual exotic species, such as: Chinese funeral cypress (Cupressus funebris) west of/beside the hall; Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) on the main stone outcrop and many maritime pines (P.pinaster) from California and Southern Europe respectively; Mediterranean/'Irish' strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) on the left inside the main entry gate towards the church's entry porch; Bhutan cypress (Cupressus torulosa) north of the church; native matt rush (Lomandra sp.) on the rocky outcrop and under the pines; Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus) west of the church; New Zealand lowland flax (Phormium tenax) on the rocks between gate and porch; Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) near the gate; and Asian arborvitae (Thujopsis dolabrata) north of the hall. =Church and hall= The Holy Trinity Anglican Church is sited near the midpoint of the cleared area of the site, whilst the church hall is close to the fence at the north western extremity of the site. It is located on a high point at the eastern end of the central market place, in the heart of Berrima. Its site frontage stretches the full width of the market place along Argyle Street and stretches back through thick scrub and a steep slope to the banks of the Wingecarribee River. The church itself is in the Early English Gothic Revival style used by Edmund Blacket throughout his career, and is typical of his rural churches. It is built of sandstone quarried from the banks of the Wingecarribee River, and features four equal bays running east‚Äìwest with a northern porch and southern vestry. The stonework is laid in ashlar coursing with simple hood mouldings to windows and relatively small buttresses to corners along north and south sides. A small gabled porch with boarded doors is located on the north elevation. The west elevation features a single lancet-headed window with stone tracery, stained glass and a small stone belfry with a conical roof at the apex of the gable. The original ceiling may well have been finished in blue with silver stars as it is now. The stained glass windows have been added over the course of time.  Heritage listing  The Holy Trinity Church is the first church individually designed by the state's leading Gothic Revival architect, Edmund Blacket, who would then go on to design over 100 churches, including five cathedrals, throughout Australia. The church is significant because of its social and religious associations with the local community. It is also significant through its associations with both Bishop (later Archbishop) Broughton ‚Äì Australia's first Anglican archbishop, and Edmund Blacket. It is a good representative example of the smaller Gothic Revival churches Blacket designed for various towns throughout the state and is one of the earliest of these buildings. The siting and relative intactness of the building's early fabric enhance its significance. Holy Trinity Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The series premiered on ABS-CBN's Kapamilya Gold afternoon block and worldwide via The Filipino Channel from October 15, 2018 to September 27, 2019, replacing Araw Gabi. Plot summary =Book One= Los Bastardos is based on the Cardinal Bastards series of Precious Hearts Romances Presents. The story follows the lives of five brothers struggling with one another for their rightful place in their father's heart. The root of their conflict stems from betrayals and secrets surrounding the individuals surrounding Don Roman Cardinal. Don Roman is the illegitimate son of Don Ismael Cardinal, a wealthy coconut plantation owner of the fictitious region of Victorino in the rural outskirts of Manila, Philippines. He reunites with his father as an adult, eventually inherits his father's hacienda and starts a life with his small family when tragedy strikes and he loses his wife Soledad and son, Roman Despite the tragedy, Don Roman pursues their dreams to expand and diversify the Hacienda and build a liquor distillery using ingredients from his coconut crop produce. Throughout his unhappy and lonely life, Don Roman builds a successful empire and sires five sons from four different women. All his sons inherit his handsome physique, tenacity, superior physical strength and astuteness that serves them well in their respective fields, but two sons do not benefit from his inherent kindness because of the family environment they grow up in. Roman Jr, later known as Isagani, is Don Roman's legitimate firstborn son with his wife Soledad, his true love. Don Roman and the town folks fear his young family perished in the mudslide. In fact, Soledad slips him into a passing produce truck. She pins her wedding ring on his shirt praying it would lead him to his father someday, but fails to get on the truck as it picks up speed to escape the oncoming mudslide. The child is raised by the farmers who discover the infant in their truck. Isagani Esperanza inherits his father's good qualities of kindness, compassion and bravery, as well as his father's physical strength, entrepreneurship and unique taste buds, essential for developing fine brandy. He formulates an arrack he calls Coco Brandy, when he was a student in Manila. Isagani buys a small coconut farm to set up his own distillery. He has the opportunity to realize his dreams when he is sought after by two major distilleries to partner with: the Cardinals and Silverios. Isagani chooses to partner up with the Cardinals because he admires Roman's kindness and fairness. A bond forms between Roman and Isagani though neither are aware of their kinship. Joaquin is Alba Santillan's son. Alba is a spoiled heiress obsessed with Roman but fails to win his affection. She gets rid of Soledad and her infant by pushing them off the cliff. While grieving for Soledad, she seduces him one night and then tells him she is pregnant with his second son, Joaquin. In truth, she is already pregnant by her parent's gardener, Enrico. Roman loves the infant like his firstborn, and brings Alba and their son to live in his estate where he is raised as Roman's natural son. He never marries Alba but allows her to live as the mistress of the mansion for the sake of their son. Among the five brothers, Joaquin is the only son who grows up under his care. Joaquin has a strong and loving relationship with his father and inherits his father's fairness and kindness. Joaquin does not have the malevolent and selfish traits of his mother. He grows up to lead the management team of Cardinal Distillery, loved by all. Alba tries her best to poison Joaquin's mind against Isagani, but Joaquin's innate goodness prevails and he decides not to listen to his mother. He leaves for America to sort out his feelings. But tragedy strikes when Joaquin dies in a plane crash on ill fated flight of LAKAN AIRLINES LAK271 or Flight 271 on his return. Alba's liaisons with the gardener is revealed at his memorial services. Despite the revelation Roman mourns Joaquin's passing and sends Alba away. Matteo is Maddie Asuncion Silverio's son. Maddie is the emotionally abused socialite wife of Menandro Silverio and sole heiress of the Asuncion fortune. Drawn to the lonely Don Roman, their affair produces a son, Matteo, but she ends their relationship and raises the child as a Silverio, business rivals of the Cardinals; Aware of his wife's and Roman's betrayal, Menandro uses Matteo as his secret pawn for revenge against them. He raises the child to fear him, devoid of character and moral values, encourage his greed and teaches him to despise the Cardinals. Matteo yearns for his father's approval but never gets it as his father is abusive to his children and wife. Matteo grows up in a household filled with cruelty, hatred and fear. Connor is Pilar's son, Roman's childhood friend who becomes a prostitute. Roman tries to save her from this life, and in their loneliness, they have a relationship. When Alba learns that Pilar is pregnant with Connor, Alba confronts her, and successfully taunts Pilar into leaving Roman for a wealthy client in Japan. Disillusioned with her life, she takes her pain out on Connor and abuses him. She tries to sell him to a stranger for sex but is rescued by Fausto, a con artist, who raises Connor along the same path. The trauma of his mother's rejection changes Connor, his longing for a family is replaced with hatred towards his father who he believes abandoned him. And finally there is Lucas, Sita's son. Sita is an orphan raised in the Santillan household. She grows up as Alba's personal maid and witnesses Alba's duplicitous actions to ensnare Roman. In love with Roman herself, they have a brief affair and produce Lucas. When Alba discovers their relationship, she threatens to take Joaquin away. As a concession, Roman agrees not to acknowledge Lucas as his natural son but is firm that Lucas and his mother live in the estate where Lucas is raised as companion to his son Joaquin. As a result, Lucas grows up in the Cardinal household, treated like family but never knowing the man he serves is his own father. Roman loves Lucas and treats him with respect. He also teaches Joaquin to treat Lucas like a younger brother. Lucas inherits his father's leadership skills, and his mother's patience and gentle nature. He later learns about his paternity, and though conflicted at first, steps into his role as a Cardinal with strength and grace and serves his father well. Ultimately, the five brothers‚Äô lives collide as they learn who their true father is. Connor is the first son to discover his father's identity. Renowned in the criminal underworld as the best con artist, he makes it his personal mission to bring his father down, believing his mother's lies that Don Roman abandoned them. He ingratiates himself with Isagani and Lucas to get close to Don Roman. Isagani and Lucas expose his dubious activities prompting Connor to admit his true identity, but surprisingly, he gains the protection of Roman Cardinal, who is more than happy to reconcile with his son. Connor bides his time to win his father's trust. His ulterior motive is to gain access to all of the Cardinals‚Äô bank accounts, which he intends to transfer to his secret account. But his agenda changes after several attempts fail. He softens towards his father as he learns to trust and believe his father's unconditional love and acceptance of Connor, who always wanted a family to belong to. Matteo, motivated at first to please his father Menandro, learns the truth that Roman is his real father. His keen astuteness allows him to swiftly figure out Menandro's real agenda. Furious over Menandro's treachery, he promptly strips him of his power and takes over the Silverio machinery, when he becomes the sole beneficiary of his mother's wealth. His hatred for Menandro equals his hatred for Don Roman, who he blames is the root of his miserable life. He plans to destroy him and take over the Cardinal empire. Soon after Roman learns about his three sons, he discovers his lost first born son Roman Jr is Isagani Esperanza. The news is welcomed by Lucas but not by Matteo and Connor who realize Isagani is the legitimate son and another barrier to their evil plans. Although they come from different worlds, the discovery that they are siblings affects each of the sons who carry the baggage of their fatherless youths. Unlike Isagani and Lucas who embrace their kinship, Connor and Matteo blame their miserable lives on their father. But as Roman attempts to reunite his sons, the greedy and vengeful individuals in his life make sure he fails: Menandro Silverio is determined to use Matteo to destroy him; and Roman's two former lovers - Alba and Pilar are equally set on seizing the Cardinal wealth. =Book Two= While Don Roman tries to get his four sons to reconcile, a wealthy young man in Los Angeles is preparing for a trip to the Philippines. Lorenzo Cuevas wants to destroy Roman Cardinal too. He is Don Roman's second son with Soledad. Flashback to a few years ago, his adoptive father reveals to him on his deathbed the truth that his real father is Don Roman Cardinal, the powerful ‚Äô‚ÄôHacendero‚Äô‚Äô (landlord) of the Cardinal Plantation and Cardinal Distillery. Don Pedro Cuevas tells Lorenzo of coming across Soledad a few days after typhoons and mudslides devastate the southern region of the Philippines, wandering the countryside, distraught, disheveled, with no memory of who she is or where she comes from. A few weeks pregnant, she suffers bruises and serious injuries sustained from a violent assault. He cares for her and search for her family but initially, no information surfaces. Suffering from memory loss as a result of her traumatic escape, unaware of the full facts about Alba's attempts on her life, Don Pedro Cuevas assumes she is running away from an abusive relationship. Upon investigating further, he traces her former husband to the powerful hacendero (or Hacienda owner, plantation owner) Don Roman Cardinal, who by now is living with a new family (Alba and a their infant son). Believing she is in danger and seeking to protect her, he takes the pregnant Soledad away from the Philippines and they move to California to start a new life. He renames her Consuelo and gives her and Lorenzo his surname. Consuelo recovers from her physical injuries, but her memory of her life with Don Roman and her first born son remains buried. Lorenzo believes Don Pedro Cuevas' story about Don Roman's abusive treatment towards his mother and seeks to avenge her. He conducts an investigation of the Cardinals and learns about his four other brothers. He arrives in the Philippines and arranges to meet his father and his brothers under the pretext of a business partnership with his own multinational hotel and resort corporation. He ingratiates himself with them through his previous business deals with Joaquin while the latter was in America. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Soledad decides to return to the Philippines to join her son. As she arrives in Victorino, the scenic drive down the countryside gives her a sense that it was a part of her past. Unknown to all including herself, Consuelo Cuevas is the true matriarch of the Cardinals. Soledad Cardinal returns to Victorino. Inside the Silverios' crumbling empire, Matteo decides to use his sister Dulce to get Lorenzo to partner with them. Lorenzo, on the other hand, uses Dulce to undermine Isagani, to make it easier for him to destroy his siblings and ultimately Roman. As Consuelo gets acquainted with Victorino and San Jovita, she is inexplicably surprised by its familiarity and happy with the peacefulness and beauty of its surroundings. She tells Lorenzo that she sees herself retiring there. She meets new friends and discovers a Nipa hut which she finds vaguely familiar. The caretaker tells her it is uninhabited but maintained by Don Roman Cardinal, a name that doesn't mean anything to her yet. In the meantime, Connor begins to self destruct. Drowning in his anger towards his father and jealous of his brothers' better stations in life, he drives himself into a downward spiral. In a drunken stupor, he attempts to rape Isay who is on her way home, but his partner Lupita intercepts him, renders him unconscious, and forcibly removes him from the site. Isagani finds her on the roadside and as he tries to get help, Matteo drives by and side swipes him off the ravine. This is how Consuelo Cuevas, on her way home from a day of sightseeing, finds him. Alarmed at his condition, she instructs her driver to pick him up and brings him to the Cuevas resort to be treated. News of the unconscious man rescued by Consuelo reach the Esperanzas who rush to the Ashton Resort, overjoyed to see Isagani. Consuelo remembers Irma from the Carinderia (Filipino term for a roadside cafeteria) where she enjoyed a delicious Ginata- √°n a visit stirring a pleasant yet still unknown memories. Alba is busy planning to get rid of Soledad again. She kills Enrico whose extortion attempts were distracting her, and joins forces with Menandro and Pilar, who share the same goal to destroy the Cardinals and steal their wealth. Meanwhile, Consuelo's and the Cardinals‚Äô worlds become smaller as their orbits grow closer. She is equally puzzled over her overwhelming emotions when Isagani shows her a photograph of Don Roman. Certain that Consuelo would come face to face with Don Roman soon, Lorenzo steps up his plans for revenge. He rejects the business merger with the Cardinals and join forces with the Silverios. Meanwhile, Consuelo seeks the help of specialists in Manila, certain her dreams are related to her past. Alba's mental illness declines further, plagued by nightmares of Enrico and other heinous crimes she committed. Isagani witnesses her hallucinating a conversation with Joaquin, as she confesses of Enrico's murder. Meanwhile, Roman is trying to piece things together, determined to get answers as to why Lorenzo is bent on keeping Consuelo away from the Cardinalsas. When he catches up to the woman interested in Soledad's Bahay Kubo, he is shocked when he recognizes Soledad! He tries to catch up with her at the Resort, where he is first denied entry. His imposing personality intimidates the security and staff as he goes in unchallenged. Searching every room in the resort, he finds her photograph with Lorenzo, and recognizes Soledad, his long lost wife. As Lorenzo and Isagani follow after him, Lorenzo reveals the truth that he is Soledad's second son, and that his adoptive father told him that his real father is Don Roman Cardinal, the abusive husband of Soledad Cardinal, who thought he killed her and then quickly took another woman and son to live with him While Don Roman tells him the real truth, he receives a call from Alba who has Soledad as hostage. Alba wants Roman to find her so she can kill him. Soledad tries to escape from Alba when she recognizes Alba as the woman who tried to kill her and her infant son decades back. She knocks down Alba with a large dead branch and renders her unconscious. Meanwhile, Roman and his two sons reach Alba's home and find Soledad. She immediately recognizes Don Roman and they are reunited. Alba awakens from her unconsciousness but loses her balance, falls off the cliff and is impaled on a dead tree trunk. Reunited at last, Soledad and Lorenzo move into the mansion, and the brothers make an effort to adapt to the new family dynamics. Soledad accepts Roman's illegitimate sons and plans to get them together as a family. But their first family dinner is a disaster when Lorenzo and Matteo comes to blows after Lorenzo terminates their business partnership. Meanwhile, Gigi who is still reeling from Matteo's rejection, joins forces with Menandro to bring down the Cardinals and ultimately take revenge on Matteo. Gigi runs the illegal gambling den and leads the hardcore criminals and the underworld. Soon after the family dinner, Lorenzo hosts an Ashton Resorts' grand opening with members of the business and social community attending, everyone except Matteo. Unfazed, Matteo hires an assassin to bomb the resort to create chaos and mayhem. His instructions were to plant the bomb outside the building, ensuring no one gets hurt. Menandro takes this opportunity to derail Matteo. He overrides Matteo's instructions and pays the bomber-assassin to shed blood, maim the victims and then point the blame on Matteo. That evening, Matteo arrives at the resort, gleefully anticipating to witness the commotion caused by the bomb. He catches the bomber on his way out and realizes the bomber planted the weapon inside. Matteo rushes in and tries to warn people away but it is too late for many guests, especially Sita. While everyone enjoys the festivities, Sita notices a man leaving hastily and as she tries to get closer to him, notices a glowing contraption he left in a flower bush. At the same time she sees Matteo from the upstairs window waving her away and realizes the presence of a bomb near her. Though she tries to run away to warn everyone, it detonates, hitting her with shrapnel and knocks her down. Sita dies soon after she is rushed to the hospital, but not before she is able to speak to Roman and Soledad, entrusting Lucas to them. She also gets to say goodbye to Lucas, who is devastated. Her death changes Lucas. Although the police are gathering evidences surrounding the bombing, Lorenzo and Connor suspect Matteo is involved so they investigate on their own. Lucas also suspects Matteo since he saw him at the resort. To avenge his mother's death, Lucas joins the criminal underworld of Gigi where he learns how to fight. Lucas successfully captures Matteo, tortures him in an abandoned mine and plants a bomb and detonating device to kill him. As his siblings find him, Matteo accidentally trips the detonator and a large explosion seals the cave entrance. He escapes and leaves his siblings trapped inside. They are rescued by Connor. Fully recovered, it's business as usual for Lorenzo who takes over the Silverio Distillery angering Menandro and kicks him out. Lucas, meanwhile, tormented over his mother's death, succumbs to Gigi and her dark criminal world. Lucas turns his back against his family. Elsewhere, Matteo is in danger as the Silverio mansion is set on fire by Menandro and Pilar. Don Roman orders Lorenzo and Connor to rescue Matteo. Don Roman and Soledad, decide to take Matteo into their home. He pretends to get into their good graces but continues his sinister plans to destroy the Cardinals. Meanwhile, Isagani asks Connor to help him infiltrate Gigi's gambling den where Lucas is. Isagani enters the gambling den and confronts Lucas, but gets a brutal beating by Lucas before escaping the premises. Don Roman decides to call the authorities with Matteo's assistance and Gigi is captured. While attempting to rescue Lucas, Don Roman is shot, damaging his liver. It turns out Lucas is the only match for Roman's liver transplant. Gigi is shot and killed by a mysterious assassin in the presence of Lupita and Fausto. Lucas, Fausto and Lupita flee the scene. Menandro and Pilar discuss the shooting but are unaware who did it. The mysterious shooter turns out to be Catalina Silverio's henchmen. Catalina is Menandro's lost sister, also seeking revenge against Don Roman. Matteo attempts to kill Soledad but is foiled by his siblings. Matteo escapes to hide in an old Silverio vacation home to regroup and recuperate from his injuries. In the midst of all the conflict, Isagani proposes to Isay who accepts. Lucas vows to change and rejoin the family and also donates part of his liver to save Roman. =Book Three= A new enemy emerges: Do√±a Catalina Silverio Pacheco. Her father was one of the bandits who ambushed Roman and Soledad early on, was sent to prison for it and later killed in a prison brawl. Her father's death leaves her and older brother Menando Silverio orphans. Menandro sells her to Eduardo Pacheco, a wealthy criminal boss, who marries and abuses Catalina. She loses her child, but poisons him and inherits all his wealth upon his demise. She blames Soledad and Roman Cardinal for her misery. When Menandro fails to destroy the Cardinals, Catalina takes over, arriving with her army of female assassins. Although Lorenzo and Lucas want Matteo to pay for his crimes, Don Roman wants to give him a chance to return into their fold. Hence, the brothers continue to search for Matteo with mixed feelings. Meanwhile, we learn that Dulce is the infant taken from Catalina by her husband and given to Menandro to kill. Unable to kill his infant niece, Menandro legally adopts her as a Silverio. Catalina locates and ingratiates herself to Dulce, gains her trust, and uses her as a pawn in her revenge plan. She easily manipulates Dulce to turn against the Cardinals. Jealous of Isay and Isagani's happiness and upcoming engagement, Catalina pushes Dulce to separate the young lovers. Dulce urges Matteo to gate crash Isagani and Isay's 'Pamanhikan', an engagement dinner when the bridegroom's parents ask for her hand. At the Engagement dinner, Matteo arrives and announces that Connor was Isay's rape assailant. Furious that Isay was placed in peril, Nante believes that Isagani covered it up to protect his brother. Nante calls off the engagement, instructing Isay to cut ties with the Cardinals, and files attempted rape charges against Connor and obstruction of justice against Isagani. The relationship between Isay's father and the Cardinals and Esperanzas quickly deteriorates. The wedding plans are canceled. Don Roman banishes Matteo. As a result, the brothers gather all their evidence and file multiple charges against Matteo who is arrested and incarcerated. While the Fiscal office finds Nante's charges against the Cardinal brothers without merit, Nante plans to take Isay to Catbalogan. Meanwhile, Catalina befriends Soledad and Roman and manipulates Dulce, now estranged from the Cardinals. Her toxic influence quickly transforms Dulce from a good doctor into an enemy of the Cardinals. Unaware of Dulce's duplicity, Isay turns to her trusted friend, who urges her to choose her father. To Dulce's frustration, Isagani refuses to give up on their love, convincing Isay to elope, have a church wedding and then face Nante's ire together. Isay confides in Dulce, who wastes no time warning Nante, foiling their marriage plans once again. Back in jail, Matteo enacts a fake attempt on his life following a plan hatched by Catalina and Dulce, to get him confined into a mental institution where Catalina is a major benefactress and can control the environment. Elsewhere at the resort, Diane gets wasted after being stood up on her blind date. Three men try to take advantage of her inebriation, but Lorenzo rescues her from their aggressive advances and has security kick them off the premises. As he tries to knock some sense into Diane, they become intimate and end up sleeping together. This affects their working relationship soon after as both are confused and awkward with each other. Lorenzo tries to admit his real feelings but is confused about it. Meantime, Nante has a change of heart when an attempt is made on Isay's life by Catalina's assassin. He witnesses the Cardinals risk their own lives to rescue his daughter. Nante gives his blessings for their wedding. Meanwhile, Don Roman is shocked to see Matteo's deteriorating mental state and tries to have him transferred. Unknown to everyone, Matteo is being slowly drugged with powerful psychotic drugs by medical staff under Catalina's orders. By this time, Catalina's unusual interest in Soledad and Roman arouse their sons' suspicions. The Cardinals uncover the connection between Menandro and Catalina, and confirm she is the shadowy Se√±ora referred to by criminals. Lucas also overhears Menandro boasting that the bomb exploding inside the resort that killed his mother, was his idea - \\"Matteo simply wanted to scare, but I wanted to maim and kill.\\" Isagani also discovers that Catalina has been visiting Matteo in the mental facility on several occasions. When Don Roman tries to have him transferred, Dulce refuses and instead demands the Cardinals to stay away from Matteo, threatening a restraining order. Dulce's transformation from a kind, and compassionate doctor into a jealous and unreasonably scorned woman, is complete. She tries to poison Isay and almost kills Isagani. Distraught, she calls Catalina who reveals that she is her mother. From this point, Dulce blindly obeys her mother. Earlier at Catalina's island, Se√±ora advises Lupita and Fausto that they cannot leave until they complete their next assignment. Lupita wants out but Catalina holds Fausto hostage. Catalina recognizes Lupita's superior skills and intends to gain her loyalties so she can serve as her eyes and ears in Menandro's gambling world. Lupita plays along. Meanwhile, the Cardinal brothers obtain evidence of Catalina's shadowy world and her using Matteo's mental illness to harm the Cardinals. Connor also discovers Lupita in Menandro's illegal gambling den. She helps him escape and tries to convince her to escape with him but she won't abandon Fausto. The Cardinals hatch a plan to capture Catalina and Menandro, and rescue Lupita and Fausto. Knowing her cover is blown after an acrimonious heart to heart between Soledad and Catalina turns ugly, lines are drawn. Catalina arranges for Matteo to leave the facility and calls Dulce, Matteo and Menandro to her secret base in Santa Jovita where she reads them the riot act on the final destruction the Cardinals. She is unaware that Soledad has her sons following Menandro, Dulce and Matteo, and the four brothers witness the meeting. Dulce tries one last time to win Isagani back and fails. As planned, the Cardinals follow her as she unsuspectingly leads them to the Silverios' new gambling den. Carolina comforts the distraught and near-hysterical Dulce. Isay is saddened over Dulce's deception. The Cardinals have the gambling den raided and closed, effectively shutting off Catalina's main source of cash liquidity. The Silverios go into hiding. While a nationwide search is conducted by the police, the Cardinal wedding ceremony goes without incident, although the brothers intercept a sniper assassin hired by Menandro to massacre the bride and groom and as many guests as possible. The couple learn about the attempt after they return from their honeymoon. Connor was alerted by Lupita who is determined to protect Connor and the Cardinals. The Cardinals continue to pursue the Silverios, gathering as much evidence to bring them to court. They learn that Matteo is released from the mental institution but they do not know where he is hiding. Fact is, he is brought to Catalina's secure island fortress, where she incarcerates Menandro for his failure to stop the Cardinal wedding. Matteo is Catalina's chief weapon to use against Roman, who is not giving up on his wayward son. Dulce, on the other hand, has a revenge plan of her own. Furious over her mother's failure to stop the wedding, she secretly leaves the island on several trips to follow Isagani to his new home with Isay. Isagani built Isay a beautiful matrimonial bungalow and the newlyweds are enjoying their first weeks as man and wife. Unknown to them, Dulce watches and plans her next move, even entering their home while Isay tends to her household chores. In the meantime, Lorenzo realizes he is in love with Dianne but her familiarity with Connor makes him jealous. Things come to a head when he comes across Connor and Dianne in an embrace. Though it was a brotherly hug, Lorenzo's jealousy erupts into a fight with Connor. Furious, Dianne confronts him where he finally admits he is in love with her. Diane refuses to believe Lorenzo's sincere feelings for her. =Finale= Another tragedy hits the Cardinals when Catalina ambush and assassinate Bert and Irma Esperanza. The ambush occurs on route to Irma's surprise birthday party. Lorenzo, following as escort behind the van, is overpowered by Catalina's men. During the altercation, Catalina arrives and shoots the couple in cold blood. Isagani's parents die in each other's arms, and that is how Isagani finds them. The deaths of his adoptive parents affect Isagani who embarks on a murderous rampage for justice. The Cardinals once again cast their safety net and fight to get Isagani back into their fold. The Cardinals learn that Menandro and Pilar are working with Catalina. To trap Catalina, Isagani pretends to forsake Isay and his family in a ploy to penetrate Catalina's hideout. The plan works and Pilar recruits him for Catalina. Catalina tests Isagani's loyalty, ordering him to kill Isay, and then instructs Dulce to accompany him to make sure she is dead. Isagani poisons his wife and she succumbs to the toxin, but Connor brings the antidote in time to revive her. The plan works as Catalina brings Isagani into her force as her assassin. Their plan unravels when Matteo discovers Isagani with Isay and his brothers. He finds Menandro hiding in Isagani's hideout, traps and kills Menandro in the burning house, and returns to tell Catalina. Meanwhile, out to settle her score against Catalina, Nina discovers that Lupita is working against Catalina, captures her and brings her back to the Island to claim back her position as Catalina's right hand. Both Lupita and Fausto are tortured. They are saved by the arrival of the Cardinal brothers and the authorities. Catalina escapes with Nina and Mateo but blows up the island. Connor saves Lupita by switching the bomb jacket. The boat explodes and Connor is missing, feared dead. While the Cardinals and the authorities search the surrounding areas for Connor, Lupita and Fausto are rushed to the hospital. Dulce is among Catalina's army captured during the raid. With plans to escape, she shoots herself so they bring her to the hospital instead of prison. Meanwhile, her army diminishing into a handful, Catalina hides in her childhood home. Matteo is her only weapon remaining as she fuels his anger with a psychotic drug. As the Cardinals escalate their raids on Catalina's criminal network, Catalina's key henchmen are captured, including the mayor who provides her safe passage, her lawyer and Nina. They cooperate with authorities to catch Catalina. Meanwhile, Dulce escapes from the hospital but is captured by Pilar. Matteo obtains crucial information on the Cardinals' vulnerability: the Cardinal women. Catalina orders her remaining army to kidnap the Cardinal women, offering the last of her gold bars as reward. The Cardinals learn the source of Catalina's hatred towards them: she blames Roman & Soledad for the death of her father, a bandit they had fought off and sent to jail long ago. The Cardinal successfully rescue their girlfriends, but are blindsided by the home invasion of the Cardinal Estate by Matteo, Dulce and Catalina. Roman & Soledad are taken hostage. As the Cardinal brothers rush to their parents, their girlfriends rescue Connor. The brothers are captured and reunited with Roman and Soledad who are strapped with a bomb. An argument ensues between Catalina and the Cardinals, Matteo is surprised that this brothers and his father continues to fight for his right as a family member. Roman suffers a heart episode which requires his medication, asking Matteo to retrieve it, which he does. This enrages Dulce, and as the siblings get into a violent argument, the Cardinal brothers, free their patents and hide inside the large mansion. Catalina breaks up the fight between Dulce and Matteo. She recaptures the Cardinal brothers, and orders Matteo to kill them. He refuses, further infuriating Catalina who decides to take matters into her hands and detonates the bombs her henchmen planted throughout the mansion. Fortunately, Connor and the Cardinal women successfully detonate the bombs a few minutes earlier. Horrified that her mother is bent on killing them all, Dulce tries to escape, but is overpowered by Lupita and the Cardinal women. Matteo, battling the demons exacerbated by the drugs Catalina feeds him with, begins to doubt his hatred towards the Cardinals. As he hesitates finishing off his brothers, Roman comes forward to embrace his wayward son. Mad out of her mind, Catalina fires at Roman but Matteo takes the bullet and pushes Catalina off the stair rails. Despondent, Matteo goes to the mansion's balcony and attempts suicide as he recalls how he has lost everything, including his mother. Roman and his brothers plead with him to not kill himself. Each ask him to forgive them for their misjudgments and lack of compassion, and the sins they committed against him. Remembering Sita's words to him about forgiveness, as she tended to him on the road, Matteo forgives his brothers. He is sent to a mental institution for rehabilitation. Dulce is sentenced to life imprisonment, and Catalina survives the fall and committed to the psych ward in a mental institution. She lives the rest of her life in a straight jacket, losing her mind completely over imagined rats surrounding her bed. With the Silverios finally defeated, the Cardinals finally live in peace, marrying their loved ones and have children. At Lucas' and Coralyn's wedding, Isagani learns that Isay is pregnant again, while Lorenzo and Dianne have three children. The last scene shows the entire family eating lunch al fresco celebrating another milestone: Matteo is finally released from the mental hospital fully rehabilitated. He begins rebuilding his relationship with his brothers, their wives, his father and Soledad.

The fungus has no known asexual state, and unlike many related fungi, is intolerant of high heat exhibiting limited growth when incubated at temperatures over 35 ¬∞C. In rare cases, the fungus is an opportunistic pathogen of marine animals and humans causing cutaneous and subcutaneous infection.  Taxonomy and discovery  Chaetomium murorum was first discovered by August Carl Joseph Corda in 1837 when he sampled the fungus from a wall in Prague. The Latin name \\"murorum\\" means \\"wall\\". In 2016 X. W. Wang et al. re-examined a set of cultures of Chaetomium-like fungi using phylogenetic analysis of the DNA directed RNA polymerase II subunit gene sequence. Chaetomium murorum, together with the genus Emilmuelleria, were then transferred to the genus Botryotrichum as the phylogenetic analysis confirmed that they clustered in the Botryotrichum clade. The current name for C. murorum is B. murorum.  Ecology  B. murorum is a soil fungus also known to occur on animal dung of a range of animals including birds. It is also commonly found in indoor environment and on crops including sugarcane, rice, banana, pea, pumpkin, and cucumber. B. murorum is mesophilic with the optimum growing temperature of . It exhibits limited growth rate at 35 ¬∞C and above. This species grows on a wide range of microbiological growth media under standard clinical laboratory culture conditions, including oatmeal agar (OA), potato carrot agar (PCA), dichloran 18% glycerol agar (DG18), malt extract agar (MEA), and has shown to be able to metabolize keratin. Along with other close related species of Chaetomium such as C. globosum and C. funicola, B. murorum can degrade cellulose material in paper, as it expresses cellulase, xylanase, peroxidase, and laccase activities. The fungus can be utilized in waste degradation biotechnology.Illustration of B. murormum in Kryptogamenflora f√ºr Anf√§nger (1922) by Dr Gustav Lindau (1866‚Äì1923) Original line illustration of Chaetomium murorum (= Botryotrichum murorum)  Morphology  In MEA medium, the ascoma of the Chaetomiaceae-like species is categorized as perithecium with unique ornamentation attached to it. It appears to be brownish or purplish, lemon shaped, with jigsaw-puzzle like (textura epidermoidea) or interwoven (textura intricata) outer walls. The ascoma is typically 160-320 Œºm in height and 150-279 Œºm in diameter. The iconic long wavy terminal hair is four times longer than the ascoma, which can grow up to 3 mm long, ending with a curly tip. The ascoma also has shorter, wavy lateral hairs. The asci grow in bundles, usually club-shaped, and usually form eight irregularly arranged, 12‚Äì16.5 x 7‚Äì8.5 Œºm ball-shaped ascospores, with apical germ pores. The ascospores turn brown when mature. Although it is theoretically capable to reproduce asexually, only sexual morph is observed. The appearance and growth rate of B. murorum colonies vary depending on the growth medium. For example, MEA medium colonies appear to be unpigmented (white in colour) or light brown, and OA medium colonies appear to be purple at the center and unpigmented at the surrounding area. A certain degree of morphological diversity is observed in different cultures of the same species.  Pathogenesis  Even though the fungus is frequently found in indoor environment, and has been isolated from wide range of human food, only isolated subcutaneous infections due to superficial wound caused by contaminated material, such as contaminated agricultural tools, are reported. The infection can cause subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis mostly in people with compromised immune systems. Symptoms include lesion, pus, thickening of skin, and chromoblastomycosis-like, muriform bodies-less tumorous mass, which makes it easily to be misdiagnosed. The fungus was reported to cause dark red, brownish plaques on chest and abdominal region in an agricultural worker. As B. murorum prefers to grow in body parts with lower temperature, most infections are located in extremities, skin, and nails. B. murorum can also cause cutaneous hyperplasia in marine animals.  Mycotoxins  B. murorum produces the secondary metabolites Chaetoxanthone C and D, which cause selective cytotoxicity towards some human protozoan parasitic pathogens, such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium falciparum. These metabolites are candidates for antiprotozoal drug. The chemical pigment isocochliodinol and neocochliodinol, unique to B. murorum and its close related fungus C. amygdalisporum, has shown cytotoxic activity towards HeLa cells.

Instead she is focused on song-writing, guitar playing, and trying to get into Northwestern University for creative writing. Before she leaves for university her doctors suggest a skin graft from a cadaver that might help her cosmetically. After her mother and brother pressure her, Fiona decides to go for the surgery. Fi Doyle is a version of Fiona that never sustained facial injuries. She is close friends with Trent, but rejects his romantic advances. Obsessed with lacrosse, her life is changed when she severely injures her ankle putting her chance of attending Northwestern University on a sports scholarship in jeopardy. While on rest she meets a home schooled boy called Marcus King and the two begin dating. Fi decides not to apply to Northwestern so she won't have to be apart from Marcus but is shocked when she discovers that, despite claiming to have severe allergies, he actually has a weakened heart and is dying. Fiona's surgery is a success and she attends Northwestern University for creative writing. While there she meets Jackson King who is also from Memphis and the two begin a flirty friendship despite the fact that Fiona is still dating David long distance. Despite knowing that Fiona has a boyfriend Jackson asks Fiona on a date. During the course of their discussion they eventually come to realize that the skin from the skin graft that Fiona received was from Jackson's deceased twin brother, Marcus. The realization causes the two of them to abort their friendship. In Fi's timeline she delays going to Northwestern for lacrosse in order to be by Marcus' side. He dies and she finds herself going to a local university that she hates with a terrible lacrosse team made up of amateurs. Upset that her brother is becoming so distant she finds herself becoming closer to Jackson, who shares her grief, and reconnecting with Trent. After Trent urges Fi to visit him at university she realizes that he is still attracted to her and begins to consider dating for the first time since Marcus died. To her surprise Jackson gives her his blessing. As a condition of her scholarship Fiona attends music classes and is forced to finally perform one of her songs for the class. When the performance goes terribly she throws out her writing notebooks. They are retrieved by Jackson and the two share an intimate moment which is witnessed by Fiona's boyfriend David. David and Fiona break up. During summer break Fiona forces herself to confront her fear of performing in public by performing at the local coffee shop's open mic night. Jackson witnesses the performance, and after Fiona tells him that the lyrics in the song were about him, not David, the two share a kiss. After her grades tank due to her disinterest at school Fi is kicked off the lacrosse team. She works hard to up her grades before the end of the semester and succeeds. Emboldened by her achievement Fi writes to the recruiter at Northwestern to explain her situation. While the recruiter does not offer Fi a spot on the team, she does extend a spot at the summer training camp to Fi which might lead to a recruitment from the school. Fi decides to take the opportunity. Before she leaves Trent comes to visit her and confesses that he has always loved her. The two share a kiss.

A mechanical engineer by training, Adolf became managing director and co-owner of his father's firm Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1900. Along with his brother Paul Daimler, Adolf is credited with developing the distinctive Mercedes 3-pointed star logo. Biography Adolf Daimler was born on September 8, 1871, in Karlsruhe, then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Baden. He was the second son of Gottlieb Daimler and spent his childhood in Cologne when his father served as technical director at the Deutz AG gas engine factory. In 1882, the family moved to Bad Cannstatt, one of the outer city districts of Stuttgart, then the capital of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Adolf attended the nearby Royal Institute of Stuttgart (), where he graduated in 1891. After an apprenticeship at the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen company, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Stuttgart from 1895 to 1898. During this time he married Marie Schuler. In 1899 Adolf joined his father's company, Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG), which had been founded in 1890. There he helped develop the Mercedes brand. He and his brother Paul Daimler adapted a three-pointed star to represent the company and trademarked it in 1900. Their father had once used such a symbol to mark the family's house on a postcard depicting a view of the town of Deutz. Adolf became chief engineer in 1900 and deputy board member in 1904. In 1907, he was appointed Chief Operating Officer and appointed to the Board of Directors. After a long illness, Adolf died on March 24, 1913 in the university town of T√ºbingen. His funeral was held on March 26, 1913 at Uff Cemetery in Bad Cannstatt, where his father had already been laid to rest a few years earlier. His funeral was attended by a number of industrialist dignitaries, including Robert Bosch.

The station was located at Mulford Street and Chicago Avenue, in Evanston, Illinois. History Calvary opened as a stop on the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad, which operated between Chicago and Waukegan and served the adjacent Calvary Cemetery in (what was then) the village of South Evanston. At the time, the line only had a single track. The station was situated on the east side of the line, across Chicago Avenue from the main entrance to the cemetery (approximately mid way between Mulford and Oakton Streets). In May 1866, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad was leased in perpetuity to the Chicago and North Western Railway with the Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee line becoming the Chicago and North Western‚Äôs Milwaukee Division. A second track was later added in 1882. Following the opening of the Chicago and Evanston Railroad (whose right-of-way paralleled that of the Milwaukee Division through South Evanston) in May 1885, Calvary became a joint facility shared between the two companies with each railroad paying half for the cost and use of the station. At this time, the Chicago and North Western had two tracks passing the area, however a third track branched off from the eastern track to the east north of the station, passed through the facility, and terminated south of the station. A pair of side platforms were provided for boarding and alighting from the western and easternmost tracks while an island platform was set between the two eastern tracks. The Chicago and Evanston side, immediately east of the North Western, was less complex. This line had two tracks which passed by the cemetery entrance, but only one platform was provided and this was set on the west side of the western track. A joint station building was set between the two rail lines. On May 16, 1908, the Northwestern Elevated Railroad assumed operation of the Chicago and Evanston line north of Wilson Avenue in Chicago and replaced the line‚Äôs existing passenger service with its own. To facilitate the new rapid transit service, the Northwestern Elevated elected not to reuse the existing C&E; stations and instead built its own at the same locations. The cessation of Milwaukee Road service over the Chicago and Evanston line brought an end to the dual operation of the Calvary station. Following the elevation of the line through Evanston onto a solid fill embankment in 1908, the station was moved south to the north side of Mulford Street and the line was upgraded with a third track. The reconstruction simplified the station‚Äôs layout. The new station had a pair of side platforms serving the outer two tracks which were reached by a set of stairways leading down to Mulford Street. Consistent with the North Western‚Äôs left-hand running, the eastern track and platform served southbound trains (to Chicago) while the western track and platform served northbound trains (to Milwaukee). The center track was a bidirectional through track and did not serve the station. A new station building was erected at track level on the east side of the tracks and, as with Rose Hill to the south, Calvary was equipped with an elevator to allow pallbearers on funeral trains to bring coffins down to the ground for interment in Calvary Cemetery. By the 1950s, the management of the Chicago and North Western began to reassess its commuter service and came to the conclusion that the road could be operated more economically and efficiently by closing stations in and near Chicago and focusing on suburban and long-haul traffic. To this end, the company went before the Illinois Commerce Commission in June 1958, requesting permission to abandon more than twenty stops, alter train schedules, revise its ticketing structure, and raise fares on monthly tickets. On November 14, the ICC ruled in favor of granting the majority of the North Western‚Äôs requests, including the closure of the Calvary station. The fare increase and service alterations went into effect on December 1, 1958, and Calvary was abandoned along with twenty other stations either in or near Chicago on the Milwaukee, Galena, and Wisconsin Divisions.

Titho was jailed in the Netherlands after World War II for other war crimes committed there, released in 1953, and then deported to Germany. Despite an arrest warrant in Italy in 1954 Titho was never extradited to stand trial for his actions in Italy, and died in Germany in 2001, confessing and repenting his role in the atrocities just days before his death. Biography Titho joined the SS in 1932 and the Nazi Party in 1933. From 1942 he was a guard at the Amersfoort concentration camp and moved to the Herzogenbusch concentration camp in 1943. His superior, Wilhelm Harster, was promoted to head of the Sicherheitsdienst in Italy in September 1943 and took Titho with him as his driver. Harster appointed Titho as camp commander of Fossoli di Carpi in May 1944 and, after the closure of Fossoli, Titho became commander of the Bolzano Transit Camp, a position he held until the end of the war. Cibeno massacre Shortly before the Fossoli di Carpi camp was closed as a transit camp for Jews, on July 12 1944, Camp Commander Titho oversaw the execution of 67 prisoners, in reprisal for a partisan attack on German soldiers at Genoa, in what became known as the . 70 prisoners were selected, and had their names read out by Titho, who told them they were being taken to Germany. Instead, they were trucked to a local shooting range and killed, but three managed to escape. For his role in the execution of the prisoners the Italian media latter referred to him as the Executioner of Fossoli. During his time as commander at both camps, Titho's deputy was SS-Hauptscharf√ºhrer Hans Haage, who was predominantly responsible for the political prisoners. Shortly after the war, Commissioner of Criminal Police for the Province of Bolzano Arthur Schoster described Titho as \\"not an especially brutal type, rather a weak character who merely carried out the orders of his superiors\\" and as somebody that was mostly interested in having a comfortable life. Schoster, who did not know Titho well, thought that Titho was not directly responsible for the atrocities but certainly knew all about them. Schoster felt that that Titho's deputy Haage was a cruel and brutal man, in truth running the Bolzano camp as Titho was too weak for the task. Of the main German officers at Bolzano, Titho was the only one still present in the town during the allied liberation, as all others had escaped. After the war In 1951 Titho was convicted in the Netherlands for war crimes committed while he was a camp guard there, having been involved in the execution of Soviet prisoners, and was sentenced to six years in jail. He was given an additional year for his mistreatment of Dutch prisoners, but was deported to Germany in 1953 after the Netherlands had declined an earlier extradition request by Italy in 1951. In the early 1970s, his role in the Cibeno Massacre, and the deportation of Jewish camp inmates to Auschwitz from the Fossoli and Bolzano camps were investigated by the state prosecutor in Dortmund, Germany. The two heads of the department investigating Titho had both been members of the Nazi Party from an early date, and the case was terminated on grounds that it could not be proven that Titho knew that the Jews deported to Auschwitz would be killed there, and that, given the late state of the war, it was unclear whether they had eventually been killed at all. The official statement also held that the Cibeno reprisal for the partisan attack did not classify as murder but, at the most as manslaughter, and the charge was therefore invalid because of the statute of limitations. Deathbed confession Shortly before his death Titho admitted that he was, as a member of the SS, guilty of crimes committed in his area of operation and that it had affected him all his life. He apologised to the victims and their family members.

He served as a pilot in World War 1 and on the Mexican border. Woolsey was slated to become the first pilot to travel over the Atlantic Ocean when, as part of the 22,000 mile first ever Pan American Goodwill flight of 1926-27 to 23 countries in Central and South America, he died in a crash over Buenos Aires while piloting the Detroit. He was one of the last pilots to instruct Charles Lindbergh, and it was Lindbergh who fulfilled Woolsey's vision of flying over the Atlantic three months after his death. Woolsey was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. An airport in his home town of Northport, Michigan bears his name.  Early life and education  Woolsey was born in Leelanau County, Michigan, on August 29, 1894, the son of Byron Woolsey and Sarah Hall. Woolsey's grandfather, Chauncey Woolsey, died in 1864 at the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek in Hanover County, Virginia during the Civil War. His great-grandfather, Adolphus Woolsey, served in the War of 1812. Woolsey was a descendant of George (Joris) Woolsey, 17th Century settler of New Amsterdam and progenitor of the Woolsey family in America. Woolsey grew up on a dairy farm and attended school in Northport. He later studied engineering at Valparaiso University in Indiana for three years.  Early career and military service  Woolsey enlisted in the Indiana National Guard in 1916, ultimately gaining a commission as a 2nd lieutenant of artillery at the officers‚Äô training course at Fort Benjamin Harrison near Indianapolis. He served a brief stint on the Mexican border, and subsequently worked at steel mills, in Gary, Indiana. Returning to the Guard, Woolsey transferred to Camp Taylor in Kentucky to serve as an instructor, and it was here that he gained the desire to become a pilot. He went to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas for his pilot training. Kelly Field was one of 32 flight training locations to train Army pilots for the War. Woolsey received subsequent flight training in Dayton, Ohio and at Mitchell Field in Long Island, New York. He served briefly in Europe during the end of the war. In 1925, at Brooks Field in Texas, Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh received his final pilot training from Woolsey.Woolsey Airport hits 80th birthday; here‚Äôs how the family story started Retrieved September 9, 2018 thumb  Pan American Goodwill Flight and death  In 1926 Woolsey flew to Central and South America as part of the Pan American Goodwill Flight a pioneering flight that sought to promote air postal service, U.S. commercial aviation and take messages of friendship to the governments and people of the Americas while establishing new aerial navigation routes. The flight originated with five aircraft and crews taking off from Kelly Field on December 21, 1926, seeking to land in 23 Central and South American countries. The aircraft used for the journey were new observation planes, the Loening OA-1A that could be used as both land planes and sea planes, with Liberty engines and a wood interior structure with an aluminum-covered fuselage and fabric-covered wings. Each plane was named for a U.S. city and crewed by two pilots, one of whom was an engineering officer, since there were very few airfields or repair facilities along the route, with the crew choosing the motto \\"No Work, No Ride.\\" Crew of the New York: Maj.

The Detroit had the cable to the left wheel used for landing break, so Woolsey and Benton decided to fly to Buenos Aires with the wheel retracted, and intended to crawl out to manually release the wheel prior to landing. At roughly 1600 feet Benton climbed out on the wing to lower the wheel. The Detroit and New York accidentally collided mid-air and got locked together.Eaker's Pan American Mission. Air Force Magazine, September 1986, pages 179-187 The crew of the New York were able to parachute to safety before their plane crashed. Woolsey and Benton were killed when the Detroit hit the ground and burst into flames. Woolsey died largely because he remained with the plane as Benton did not have a parachute on when he went onto the wing. \\"I have never witnessed a more courageous sacrifice,\\" said Eaker, who witnessed the crash from his plane.Cute airport, tragic story: Woolsey a hero Retrieved September 9, 2018 After his death Woolsey, along with Benton, lay in state in Buenos Aires as thousands paid tribute.

She was built in 1913 by a family of boat builders, named Walton, who had built several steamships for service on the Magnetawan River. As development of the Magnetawan basin brought roads it reduced the need for steamboats, so they relocated north, to the Pickerel. She was the first steamship on the Pickerel, and could only navigate a small portion until the outlet of Wilson Lake was deepened. She was long, and displaced 54 tons. Unlike most other similar vessels she was built with a relatively low bow, so she could beach her bow to load or unload passengers and cargo where there were no docks. Her bow was plated with steel plates, allowing her to travel through ice-encrusted water, making her the first vessel to be used in the spring. She was worn out by 1928, and was scuttled.

Berjikly's professional focus is on improving the relationship between technology and human emotions.  Early life and education  Berjikly was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and moved to Northern California to attend Stanford University in 1997. He graduated with honors in 2001 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on Human Computer Interaction, and in 2002 with a Masters degree in Management Science and Engineering, with an emphasis on high tech entrepreneurship. At Stanford, Berjikly was named a Mayfield Fellow, elected to Tau Beta Pi, and earned academic distinctions including the President's Award for Academic Excellence, and the Terman Engineering Scholastic Award. Berjikly's extracurriculars included writing for the Stanford Daily, and serving as a teaching assistant for Stanford's CS106 and CS107 introductory computer science sequence. However, it was Berjikly's academic research in the then-nascent field of human computer interaction that would most influence his career and personal interests.  Academic Research  First working under advisor and natural language processing (NLP) pioneer, Computer Science Professor Terry Winograd, and then directly with HCI authority and Communications Professor Clifford Nass, Berjikly contributed to the corpus around Nass' theory of The Media Equation, particularly with respect to how humans interface with interactive voice response (IVR) systems. In a foundational experiment on error handling in IVR systems (what to do when the computer does not understand the speaker), Berjikly and Nass tested different strategies for handling errors, hoping to observe any potential impacts to user behavior and impressions from each respective strategy. The results demonstrated that participants strongly preferred IVRs that criticized themselves when making errors (e.g., \\"Sorry, I didn't understand\\"), and they strongly disliked systems that blamed the user (e.g., \\"Please speak more clearly.\\") Further, participants were significantly less willing to buy books from systems that blamed the user versus self-blaming systems. In short, they concluded, a company would anger its users and sell fewer products with a user-blaming IVR. One surprising finding was that while users disliked the user-blaming system, they found it to be significantly more competent and believed it made fewer errors than the self-blaming system, despite the reality that the two versions made the same mistakes at the same points in the interaction. On this point, Berjikly and Nass concluded that \\"Modesty undermines your perceived intelligence so much, that even insulting the person you are working with makes you seem more competent to that \\"Modesty undermines your perceived intelligence so much that even insulting the person you are working with makes you seem more competent to that person than criticizing yourself.\\"  Early career, thesis, and experience project  After graduating from Stanford, Berjikly took a product management role at networking technology company, Echelon where he led the product management of a combined hardware and software offering called, Networked Energy Services (NES), a networked energy solution where residential and commercial electricity meters could be read and operated remotely. The product line gained the distinction of being the first networked electricity delivery system to be deployed across an entire country, with Italian utility giant ENEL converting completely to Echelon networked meters and data concentrators. At this time, a close friend of Berjikly's developed a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Berjikly felt that the natural feeling of a loss of hope accompanying any serious medical diagnosis was further accelerated by a dearth of patient-accessible information on current research focused on treating or improving the condition. He created This is MS, as an online forum \\"chartered on empowering patients through knowledge\\" for the discussion of research on potential treatments. The site gained a reputation for positivity and insight into new and upcoming treatments. Berjikly observed that, though users were initially drawn by the subject of Multiple Sclerosis, they quickly connected with each other on many other experiences relevant to their lives, with an underlying empathy towards each other through their shared experience of MS. Berjikly noted that, \\"it gave voice to a group of people known to suffer in silence, and the opportunity to be among new friends, those who truly understood each other's challenges.\\" This spurred Berjikly to create a generalized version of This is MS, named Experience Project to provide emotional support on any topic. The concept was for users to share the life experiences that mattered to them, and to write stories about their personal experience with those life events, in order to connect with other users who could empathize with them, and provide support based on their shared backgrounds. Berjikly described his inspiration as: > \\"There are hundreds of people that we pass by each day. Any one of those > people could become a very good friend of yours if you knew which person to > stop, what questions to ask and you felt comfortable asking and they felt > comfortable answering. There is no reason not to use technology to bring us > to that point today...A new user to the site searches for something that is > of paramount importance to them and realizes, 'I'm not alone with whatever > this is. Look at all these other people going through it.\\" At its peak popularity in 2012, Experience Project was ranked in the top 2500 worldwide websites by internet traffic, and by 2016, members had shared \\"over 67 million experiences.\\"  Kanjoya  A core aspect of Experience Project was the concept of users describing an experience in their own words, and ascribing what emotions it made them feel to have that experience. Over time, Experience Project created a unique and expansive knowledge base relating how language was used to express feelings, and how that language differed depending on the nature of the experience, demographic of the speaker, geography, date, etc. This led Berjikly to found Kanjoya, an artificial intelligence company dedicated to the idea that technology could \\"delivery empathy\\" through machine learning algorithms capable of accurately recognizing, in real-time, the emotion present in written text. Early applications of Kanjoya's technology included measuring the emotional reaction of audiences during Presidential debates, understanding how viewers felt towards Super Bowl advertisements, and analyzing consumer sentiment about the economy in newspaper articles in an attempt to predict future actions of the Federal Reserve Board. Eventually, Kanjoya focused on understanding employee sentiment in the workplace, through inputs including open-ended surveys and performance reviews. Kanjoya's products addressed employee surveys, diversity and inclusion, and performance reviews. Kanjoya was acquired by Ultimate Software in 2016, where Berjikly became a Director and stewards the company's future products, including their artificial intelligence strategy. Berjikly's shared his philosophy on the use of advanced technologies like AI in the workplace: > \\"We crave to be understood with empathy, whether we‚Äôre having coffee with a > friend, or taking a survey at work. This is where technology has > historically fallen incredibly short. Scores of products are designed to > improve or understand people and their lives as employees, customers, and so > on, yet they have no capability of recognizing, understanding and respecting > the qualitative, ‚Äúleft-brain‚Äù aspects that actually drive these behaviors.\\" In 2018, Berjikly began advocating for technology companies, both vendors and consumers, to develop AI Codes of Ethics and Behaviors to actively guide the desired use and boundaries of these advanced technologies, versus passively allowing technology's capabilities alone to determine outcomes. > \\"There is a great burden ... to help people communicate, build empathy and > above all ‚Äì to help people be heard\\" In pursuit of this, Berjikly says the ultimate goal for AI in the workplace is to complement people, while recognizing, respecting and reacting to their emotions- instead of seeking to automate or replace them.  Personal life  Berjikly resides in San Francisco with his wife and children.

Prior to becoming a regent, he had served as both an elected member of the People's Representative Council and an appointment to the People's Consultative Assembly, for one term each. Born in Banyuwangi, Anas completed his education at the University of Indonesia before joining the Consultative Assembly for 2 years. Later, he was elected in 2004 for a five-year term in the legislative council, and was elected as regent of Banyuwangi after failing to win his re-election. Background and education Abdullah Azwar Anas was born in Banyuwangi on 6 August 1973, his father a local kyai in the Karangdoro village, part of Banyuwangi's Tegalsari subdistrict. Being the second children of ten, his older brother died at youth, making him the eldest surviving children. He completed his primary education in madrasa, studying in one at his origin village and another in Sumenep, Madura. He later moved to state-funded regular schools, studying in two middle schools before moving to Jember for his highschool. After completing highschool, he moved to Jakarta to study literature in the University of Indonesia (UI), earning his bachelors in 1999 before further earning a masters in social and political science by 2005. In addition, he also studied education technology at Jakarta State University (then known as IKIP Jakarta), graduating with a bachelors in 1998. During his time at UI, he was the president of the central committee of the Nahdlatul Ulama student association. He had also become a radio broadcaster of Jember- based Prosalina when at highschool. Career =Parliament= After graduating from university, he was appointed to the People's Consultative Assembly as a class envoy in 1997 at the age of 24, making him the youngest envoy of that year. Following the fall of Suharto, he ran but lost in the 1999 legislative election. Joining the National Awakening Party, he secured a seat from the East Java III district in the 2004 election after winning 135,667 votes - the third most in the district. However, he was not reelected in 2009, when he was reassigned by his party to the East Java VII district. According to Anas in an interview, he \\"was not serious\\" and was not present in the electoral district during the campaigning period. During his term, he was active in multiple special committees, and part of investigations teams on BLBI (a liquidity aid to Bank Indonesia), a 2008 fuel price hike, the 2008 hajj season and an electoral ballot case. He was part of the eighth commission. =Regent of Banyuwangi= In 2010, Anas ran in a local election for Banyuwangi Regency with Yusuf Widyatmoko as his running mate. Supported by PKB, PDI-P, Golkar, PKS and PKNU, the pair secured 49.23 percent of the votes (372,149) in a three-way contest. He was re-elected in 2015 with a landslide, winning 88.96 percent of votes with the support of PDI-P and six other parties, although his former party PKB did not support him. In 2016, Banyuwangi received an award from the World Tourism Organization, winning in the \\"Re-Inventing Government in Tourism\\" category as the first Indonesian part to receive an award from the organization. When Anas entered office in 2010, Banyuwangi was visited by 487 thousand tourists annually, with the number increasing to 4.6 million by 2017. He also established a regency-owned, 7,600-square meter tourism resort focusing on local culture. Two of the regency's programs - a peer support program for students and an electronic village budgeting program - was named by the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform in its list of 99 most innovative programs nationally. Anas established a 55,000-hectare permanent farmland area in the regency, meant to conserve the agricultural production. Economically, Banyuwangi experienced a 62% increase in GDP per capita between 2010 and 2014, with the local government budget increasing by 150% between 2010 and 2015. The regency received an award from the central government in 2016 for the economic growth. Reports of alleged corruption under his administration were filed to the Corruption Eradication Commission in 2012 and 2017.

Life  Born in Velars-sur-Ouche (Burgundy) (modern department of C√¥te-d'Or), from a family of modest farmers, Desvignes was quickly noticed for his voice and admitted as Altar server (child singing in the choir) of the . He received extensive training there, designed to turn these young singers into future professional performers. He then received further training at the musical school of the Dijon Cathedral where he had the chance to have as his teacher Jean-Fran√ßois Lesueur, who had himself been trained in ch≈ìurs d'√©glise (in Picardy) before the French Revolution in 1789. It was there that Desvignes composed his first major work in 1780, a 4-part Mass. Resolutely modern in inspiration, this small piece (a four-part choir and four soloists, without instruments) requires high level performers: for centuries, all members of the church choirs were professional, until the brutal suppression of the ecclesiastical chapters in 1790. Lesueur then had him appointed Kapellmeister to the √âvreux Cathedral. He was 17 years old. Desvignes stayed only a few months in this position, which he left in 1782 to become chapel master at the Chartres Cathedral, an important place in the kingdom, where he made himself known as a composer of sacred music. The dispersal of the cathedral chapters and their staff by the Revolution in 1790, followed by the closure of the churches in 1793, ended this first career. Desvignes then moved to Paris and converted to opera. He composed several patriotic tunes for the Th√©√¢tre de la Cit√©. Appointed professor in 1793 at the newly founded Conservatoire de Paris, he became chapel master of the Notre- Dame de Paris cathedral in 1802, shortly after the signing of the Concordat between Bonaparte and the papacy, a treaty that allowed the churches to reopen, expected and initiated (informally or very limited) from 1795/1796. As had been the case before throughout France, the mission of the Notre-Dame music school was to train the young singers who were members of the choir (holding the soprano part), with the ambition of making them (once they have become adults) professional members of the choir of the Metropolitan Church of Paris, or of the other churches in France. Despite a cruel lack of financial resources (because the Ancien Regime had not been resurrected), Desvignes then worked to restore the educational establishment abolished by the Revolution (the Christian religion and all its manifestations had been banned in 1793, under the Reign of Terror, while the cathedral had been transformed into a Temple of Reason). In this position, Desvignes trained quite a few young people who played a role in the development of French music of that time. Some of them were the double bassist and professor at the Conservatoire, Armand Durier; the Grand prix de Rome Albert Guillon; the organist and composer Alphonse Gilbert, second Grand Prix de Rome; the librarian of the Conservatoire Auguste Bott√©e de Toulmon; the harpist Fran√ßois-Joseph Naderman and, of course, the composer √âmile Bienaim√©, also second Grand Prix of Rome, whom Desvignes appointed as music master, i. e. conductor and master of the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris. In 1811, Desvignes became deputy head of the musical chapel of Napol√©on Ier at the Tuileries Palace. He became a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon in 1820. Throughout his career, Desvignes has tried both sacred and secular music, especially lyrical music. Among his most striking creations, the Lamentations de J√©r√©mie (text taken from the Bible is worth mentioning, quite often set to music), his Te Deum and, particularly, a Funeral March for 5-part choir and orchestra, curiously written from the liturgical Pie Jesu. It was composed on the occasion of the service celebrated at Notre-Dame-de-Paris in 1806 to commemorate the dead of the Battle of Austerlitz. His contemporary, the critic Albert Gilbert, considered it \\"as one of his most remarkable inspirations\\". The composer took it over in 1808 on the occasion of the death of cardinal de Belloy, the Archbishop of Paris. The audience was impressed and attributed it to Mozart, whose Mass of Requiem was performed during the same service.An anecdote told by Albert Gilbert in the biographical note \\"Pierre Desvignes\\" that he published in the Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris, 7th year, 1840. issue 38, 31 May 1840, pages. 322-23. Pierre Desvignes died in 1827 in Paris and it was his student √âmile Bienaim√© who was chosen to succeed him.  Works  Desvigne's work was manifold. He composed four op√©ras comiques, two serious operas, eleven masses, ninety-five motets, eleven psalm settings and four cantatas, as well as two practice pieces. * Messe √† quatre parties, volume 91 of editions of the Centre de musique baroque de Versailles, Patrimoine musical bourguignon, 2005, 40 pages - in Latin. * La F√™te de l'√©galit√©, pantomi- lyrical melodrama, in one act and in verse - First edition published in 1793 in French. * Pie Jesu Domine, in the form of a Funeral March for choir and orchestra, composed in 1806 for the first anniversary service celebrated at Notre-Dame de Paris in memory of the dead of the Battle of Austerlitz and given again for the burial of His E. the Cardinal of Belloy, Archbishop of Paris (1808).

She lectured on various subjects, especially on educational and sociological questions, and was well-known as a leader and speaker in the club world. Merrill was a charter member of the New England Woman's Press Association. Early years and education Estelle Minerva Hatch was born at Jefferson, Maine, September 30, 1858. She was the daughter of Gilman E. and Celenda S. Hatch. As a child, Merrill attended the public schools of her native town. At fourteen years of age, she entered Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Massachusetts, graduating in 1877. Career Upon her graduation, she returned to Jefferson to teach. At the end of two years' successful work in that place, she again came to Massachusetts, and taught school for three years in Hyde Park. She worked towards establishing in the public schools of Hyde Park an additional course, giving practical business training, opportunities for which previously could be obtained only at private schools.

She also furnished at intervals articles for the Boston Transcript, written under the signature of \\"Jean Kincaid.\\" A break in health, the result of overwork, necessitated rest and change. During her long convalescence, she spent more time writing, her first regular work as a journalist being on the Boston Globe. From furnishing special articles, she progressed to a salaried position. Journalism became such a fascinating occupation that, though she was offered a lucrative professorship in botany in a Southern college, she chose to remain in the newspaper field. Merrill served as co-editor, with Dr. Mary Wood-Allen, of American Motherhood, a Boston magazine devoted to the interests of mothers and home-makers. On October 1, 1887, she married Samuel Merrill, a native of Charlestown, New Hampshire, a member of the Suffolk County, Massachusetts bar, and of the editorial staff of the Boston Globe.

The field is managed by Dusup - the Dubai Supply Authority. Condensate production ran at some 25,000 barrels per day in 2010. Margham also has an oil production capability. Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level. The field is connected by pipeline to Jebel Ali, where the gas condensate is loaded onto tankers for export. Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015. Margham was initially developed as a liquids stripping/gas recycling project (dry gas was pumped back into the reservoir), but now operates as a gas storage facility for Dubai since 2008, allowing Dubai to depend on gas produced from Margham for its electricity generation and desalination needs. This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Baghdad, 1960) is an Iraqi multi-media artist, photographer, animator, video producer and installation artist noted for producing \\"existentialist\\" works with dark, shadowy figures that speak of human frailty. Life and career Sadik Kwaish Alfraji was born in Baghdad in 1960. His initial training was as a painter and printmaker, obtaining first a Diploma of Plastic Art and Painting from Baghdad's Institute of Fine Arts (1982) and later a Bachelor of Arts from Baghdad's Academy of Arts (1987). He studied art not long after Saddam Hussein came to power. Like many other artists, Alfraji realised that the Ba'ath Party was attempting to co-opt art and culture for use as propaganda. However, artists have the ability to play around with concepts, and they began to conceal their intended message using abstraction and other techniques to construct messages of protest that the authorities could not understand. ‚ÄúDictators are stupid,‚Äù he noted, ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt necessarily read between the lines.‚Äù As a young artist in Baghdad in the 1980s, Alfraji worked as an animator for children's television. This sparked a life-long interest in animation and multi-media productions, which has since become the foundation for much of his work. At the time of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Alfraji produced a series of etchings of psychiatric patients as well as an art book, Biography of a Head (1985), the story of a head without a body. After the war, shortages of art materials and media forced many artists, including Alfraji to use \\"found\\" material such as shrapnel and bullets, which were incorporated into their artworks. Alfraji left Iraq in the 1990s for political reasons and later settled in Amersfoort, The Netherlands where he was granted Dutch citizenship. After arriving in The Netherlands, he returned to study, enrolling at the Constantijn Huygens, Kampen, Netherlands and taking out a Diploma in Graphic Design in 2000. He has returned to Iraq only once, in 2009, at the time of his father's death. On this visit, an encounter with his 12-year old nephew became the inspiration for his animated video, Driven By Storms, which has since been acquired by the British Museum. The artist explains: He is the subject of a book, simply titled Sadik Kwaish Alfraji, edited by Nat Muller, Schilt Publishing, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2015). Work  As he often states, his work has been influenced by Expressionism, as well as his love of philosophy and literature, especially existentialism. His artworks, with their shadowy, faceless figures and dark backgrounds are distinctive. The overarching theme in all his work is the frailty of the human condition and the question of human existence. He has exhibited at scores of Middle Eastern and European galleries. He is one of a select group of Iraqi artists to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in 2017. Alfraji‚Äôs works are housed in public collections including the British Museum, London; National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad; The Art Center, Baghdad; National Gallery of Fine Arts Amman; Shoman Foundation, Amman; Royal Association of Fine Arts, Amman; Novosibirsk State Art Museum, Russia; and the Cluj- Napoca Art Museum, Romania; Los Angeles Country Museum; and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Awards * 2012 Artist of the Year at the Esquire Middle East Awards, Dubai, UAE. * 2014 Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center awardee, Italy. * 2015 Grant, Driven By Storms (Ali‚Äôs Boat), Mondriaan Fund, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Early life Henry Howell Williams was born in 1796 to Howell Williams and Dorothy (Wheat) Williams in Providence, Rhode Island. His older brother was Samuel May Williams. Career Williams started work as a sailor from a young age. He joined the Columbian Navy as a young man, serving for several years. After ending his tour with the Columbian Navy, he visited San Felipe de Austin, where his brother Samuel was a legal secretary for the colony. Williams applied for a Mexican land grant, but left before establishing his claim. He instead returned to the United States to work in Baltimore for a merchant, his uncle, Nathaniel Felton Williams. Invincible depicted as wrecked in 1837 Williams was a financier of the Texas Revolution. He managed a family commission house in Baltimore, where he transferred his letters of credit to Samuel, who supplied the Texas Navy with the ammunition, guns, and the schooner Invincible.Henson (1976), pp. 8081. After Texas gained independence, Williams assisted its Navy again while acting as Texas Consul to the United States. He was a liaison between the Texans and the shipbuilder Nicholas Dawson, who supplied six new ships.Henson (1976), p. 101. Williams dispatched the first direct shipment from Texas to England. He delivered cargoes of supplies to the McKinney and Williams wharf, guaranteed advances to Texas cotton planters, and loaded cotton onto the large English brig, Ambassador.Henson (1976), p. 112. Williams was appointed to serve as president of the board of directors of the Galveston City Company. He was an investor in shares of the company, and invested in other Texas real estate. He operated his own eponymous commission house in Baltimore, H. H. Williams and Company.

It is also known as Munday Cottage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Jellore Cottage dates from 1860s. It has been claimed that it was built for the stable-manager of the Victoria Inn. The \\"Settler's Hut\\" at the rear of the cottage was erected in Wheeo as a bushman's hut 1840s, and after falling into disrepair, was moved to Berrima and re- erected in the 1990s. Jellore Cottage was renovated in the 1950s, with interior walls, floors and ceilings covered in masonite, the fireplace boarded over, the fuel stove in the kitchen removed and the chimney sealed. Prior to 1991, the original windows of Jellore Cottage were replaced with aluminium framed components and a modern steel balustrade was added to the front verandah and modern fence. It was restored by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales from 1992. Between 1991 and 2010, the aluminium windows were replaced with timber colonial pane type, and the fence was replaced with timber picket fence. It now operates as bed and breakfast accommodation.  Description  Jellore Cottage is a single storey weatherboard cottage with gabled roof continued as a skillion over the front verandah. Has 2 external brick chimneys at east end with simple band of projecting brickwork as neck moulding. The timber framed verandah is supported on 5 square timber posts (not original). The weatherboard lining of the main gable end walls is continued over the ends of the verandah. The original windows have also been replaced with modern timber colonial style windows. The grounds feature a cottage garden to street with a (recent, sympathetic) low timber picket fence to Jellore Street and the cottage set well back on the block. The site is a long block running north to the Wingecarribee River. West of the cottage is a line of tall, mature Bhutan cypresses (Cupressus torulosa), a former hedge. To the rear is a Lombardy poplar tree (Populus nigra 'Italica'). At the rear of the cottage is the \\"Settler's Cottage\\", a vertical slab cottage that was moved from another site and rebuilt, and another garden.  Heritage listing  This cottage is significant to the local community as a typical representative of the small 19th century weatherboard cottages to be found throughout Berrima. Its overall form and what remains of its early detailing also contribute to the significance of the group of early buildings along Jellore Street. Jellore Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

History  Established in 2012, AFL Media provides content to AFL.com.au and the AFL Live mobile app, and formerly published the AFL Record from 2012 to 2018. Although Telstra currently holds the digital media broadcasting rights for AFL games, there is an agreement in place that allows AFL.com.au to host video content from Telstra Media. Telstra also receives the advertising revenue from the website. Although AFL Media is located in the same building as the AFL's headquarters in Docklands, Victoria, it employs an independent editorial and journalist team to report on the league and produce content on its various mediums. Since its inception as a business, AFL Media had published the match-day AFL Record; however Crocmedia acquired the publishing arm of AFL Media in July 2018, and will assume the operations of producing the AFL Record and its related brands from 2019. =Standing down of Mitch Cleary controversy= The Mitch Cleary standing down controversy was a dispute centred around AFL Media's decision to stand down journalist Mitch Cleary for posting a tweet revealing Brooke Cotchin, the wife of Richmond Tigers player Trent Cotchin, had breached the Australian Football League‚Äòs (AFL) social distancing rules in the interstate \\"hubs\\" that all Victorian AFL teams were in following a resurgence of COVID-19 in Victoria. The move was widely condemned as a ‚Äúbetrayal of journalism‚Äù, and led to widespread public backlash, with many figures urging AFL Media to reinstate him to his position. Among the figures calling for his reinstatement was Brooke Cotchin, who voiced her support for Cleary in a tweet. Due to the backlash, AFL Media eventually walked back on their decision, reinstating Mitch Cleary to his previous position. Reactions and aftermath Journalist Caroline Wilson recommended that Cleary, who she deemed a \\"serious journo\\", should stop working for AFL Media. After the incident, fellow AFL Media journalist Damian Barrett declared his support for the AFL‚Äôs decision, a statement which was widely mocked, as Barrett has a poor reputation among the AFL community. The controversy resulted in a significant worsening of approval towards AFL Media, with several figures, including president of the Collingwood Football Club Eddie McGuire and radio broadcaster Gerard Whateley, stating that it had undermined the image of AFL Media as being independent from the Australian Football League. Journalist Rohan Connolly deemed the event a \\"disaster\\", and stated that it was the product of a gradual decline in the quality of AFL Media's reporting. He went on to state that the event could undermine public confidence in the AFL.  Content  AFL Media provides content for a range of digital products including AFL.com.au and the 18 clubs' official websites, the AFL Live mobile app and the various social media channels operated by the AFL on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. It also produces a range of podcasts and online videos analysing various aspects of the AFL, as well as operating the league's photography and film departments: AFL Photos and AFL Films, respectively. It has been speculated that AFL Media could potentially control the broadcast of AFL games in future broadcasting agreements, and either directly sell to audiences itself or on-sell the content to free-to-air and subscription television networks.  Criticism  Due to its direct affiliation with the Australian Football League, AFL Media has received criticism from rival media outlets and journalists questioning whether it can truly provide independent coverage of the league, and that it is not just a public relations tool. Former St Kilda coach Grant Thomas publicly reiterated this criticism in 2016, stating that AFL Media was \\"avoiding\\" reporting on several controversial issues to protect the AFL's brand.

Etymology  Sadan refers to non-tribal Indo-Aryan ethnic groups of Jharkhand. The term Sadan probably derives from Nishada, referring to an ethnic group of North India. History Bhimbetka The Chota Nagpur plateau region has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. Several stone tools and microliths from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods were discovered in this region. In the Bhimbetka rock shelters, a 9,000-year- old Mesolithic painting of a group dance is similar to the Sadani folk dance Jhumair. During the Neolithic period, agriculture started in South Asia. Several Neolithic settlements have been found in sites such as Jhusi, Lahuradewa, Mehergarh, Bhirrana, Rakhigarhi, and Chirand. In the Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of the Son and North Koel rivers in Palamu district, various antiquities and art objects from the Neolithic to medieval periods have been found; the pot-sherds of redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware, and NBP ware are from the Chalcolithic to late medieval periods. There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district, from the Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000-5,000 BC). Iron slag, microliths, and potsherds from 1400 BCE, according to carbon dating, were discovered in Singhbhum district. During the late Vedic period, several janapadas emerged in northern India. Several Nishada kingdoms probably existed in Jharkhand during that time. In the 6th century BCE, the mahajanapadas emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent. Some parts of present-day Jharkhand were parts of the Magadha and Anga mahajanapadas. In the Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya empire during Ashoka's reign (c. 232 BCE). During the medieval period, the Nagvanshi, Ramgarh Raj, and Chero dynasties were ruling this region. The Mughal influence reached this area during the reign of Emperor Akbar when it was invaded by Raja Mansingh in 1574. There was several invasion during Mughal rule. Influence of the British East India Company reached this region in the 18th century. Raghunath Mahato led a revolt against the East India company in the Jungle Mahals in 1769. Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and Pandey Ganpat Rai led rebels against the East India company in the 1857 Rebellion. Tikait Umrao Singh, Sheikh Bhikhari, Nadir Ali, Jai Mangal Singh played pivotal role in Indian Rebellion of 1857. After independence this region became parts of Bihar state. In November 2000, the new state of Jharkhand separated from Bihar.  Castes and ethnic groups  Various Sadan communities include Ahir, Binjhia, Bhogta, Bhuiya, Chik Baraik, Gosain, Ghasi, Jhora, Kewat, Kharwar, Koeri, Kumhar, Rautia, Kudumi Mahato, Kurmi, Lohra, Tanti , Teli, Rajput, Bania and Lohar among others. Culture Jhumair is a common folk dance of Sadan. Chhau is another folk dance prevalent in the Kurmali-speaking region. Akhara is a village ground where people dance. The Karam and Jitia are important festivals of the Sadan. Other important festivals are Sohrai, Tussu, and Fagua.

It is also known as Carthona and Ballynahinch. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  It was built for merchant and auctioneer James Jerome Higgins and his wife Mary, with conflicting sources providing various construction dates ranging from the early 1830s to early 1840s. Higgins remained in the property until 1850. It was thereafter leased to police magistrates. Mary Stone used it as a school 1900, after which it became derelict until 1927. From 1927 it was owned by prominent local family the Browns for several decades, who undertook extensive renovations. Description Magistrate's House is an early Berrima modified Georgian house with cedar doors, floors of solid jarrah and a stone flagged front verandah. Single storied and built of ashlar sandstone, the house has a half-gabled corrugated steel clad roof (with louvred ventilators) and wide, raftered eaves. The hipped front verandah roof is of similar \\"raftered\\" character (Both roofs may be later alterations). The 4 chimneys are stone with simple, flat neck moulds. Windows to the west elevation have louvred shutters. The tall Oak and Poplar trees, as well as the hedge, provide a distinctive setting. Significance Ballynahinch is significant through its associations as the residence of the magistrates and the role of Berrima as a legal/administrative centre. Its setting and roofline are features which contribute to the streetscape qualities of the Marketplace and the building has some aesthetic significance as an early building with good stonework.

Videos uploaded to YouTube are compared against audio and video files registered with Content ID by content owners, looking for any matches. Content owners have the choice to have matching content blocked or to monetize it. The system began to be implemented around 2007. By 2016, it had cost $60 million to develop and led to around $2 billion in payments to copyright holders. By 2018, Google had invested at least $100 million into the system.  Overview  Content ID creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flagged as a copyright violation if a match is found.More about Content ID YouTube. Retrieved December 4, 2011. When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the \\"infringing\\" video with proceeds automatically going to the content owner. Only uploaders who meet specific criteria can use Content ID. These criteria make the use of Content ID without the aid of a major backer difficult, limiting its usage to big corporations in practice.  Context  Between 2007 and 2009, companies including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material. Viacom, demanding $1 billion in damages, said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed \\"an astounding 1.5 billion times\\". During the same court battle, Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had watched videos on the site. On March 18, 2014, the lawsuit was settled after seven years with an undisclosed agreement.  History  In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute. The system was initially called \\"Video Identification\\" and later became known as Content ID. By 2010, YouTube had \\"already invested tens of millions of dollars in this technology\\". In 2011, YouTube described Content ID as \\"very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File\\". By 2012, Content ID accounted for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.Press Statistics YouTube. Retrieved March 13, 2012. In 2016, Google stated that Content ID had paid out around $2 billion to copyright holders (compared to around $1 billion by 2014), and had cost $60 million to develop. Since mid-2018, Google has been beta-testing a new tool called Copyright Match, a simplified version of Content ID with more limited options, which would be available to uploaders with more than 100,000 views. However, contrary to Content ID, which sends copyright notices automatically, with Copyright Match no action is taken until the creator chooses to do so.  Trademark lawsuit  In 2006, YouTube and content protection company Audible Magic signed an agreement to license the use of Audible Magic's own \\"Content ID\\" fingerprinting technology. When Google bought YouTube in November the same year, the license was transferred to Google. The agreement was terminated in 2009, but in 2014 Google obtained a trademark for their own \\"Content ID\\" implementation. Audible Magic sued Google the same year on the basis that they owned the \\"Content ID\\" trademark and therefore that Google trademarking their implementation was a fraud.  Criticisms  An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube, and concluded that while the system was \\"surprisingly resilient\\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible. The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use. If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.Content ID disputes YouTube. Retrieved December 4, 2011. However, this claim is sent directly to the party that owns the supposed copyright, who has the final decision in the matter unless legal action is pursued. If the reporting party denies their claim, the channel receives a strike. If a channel receives 3 strikes, it is removed from the platform. Prior to 2016, videos weren't monetized until the dispute was resolved. In December 2013, Google changed the way the system worked (seemingly to cover YouTube in case of lawsuits), leading to numerous content creation copyright notices being sent to gameplay videos YouTube content creators. Those notices led to ad revenues being automatically diverted to third parties, which sometimes had no connection to the games. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute. Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \\"Video Manager\\". YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length. The music industry has criticized Content ID as inefficient, with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) estimating in a 2015 filing to the US Copyright Office \\"that Content ID fails to identify upwards of 40 percent of the use of UMPG‚Äôs compositions on YouTube\\". Google has countered these assertions by stating that (as of 2016) Content ID detected over 98% of known copyright infringement on YouTube and humans filing removal notices only 2%. In January 2018, a YouTube uploader who created a white noise generator received copyright notices about a video he uploaded which was created using this tool and therefore contained only white noise. In September 2018, a German university professor uploaded videos with several classical music performances for which their copyright had expired, because both the composers were dead long ago, and the performances were not covered anymore by copyright. After he received several copyright violations by YouTube, he could lift the majority of them, but Deutsche Grammophon refused to lift two of them even if their copyright had expired. In other cases, copyright violations notices were even sent to uploaders who recorded themselves playing public domain classical music, with Sony Music asserting copyright over more than 1,100 compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach via Content ID. Commentators noted that this was also the case on other platforms such as Facebook. In December 2018 TheFatRat complained that Content ID gave preference to an obvious scammer who used the automated system to claim ownership of his content and thereby steal his revenue. In April 2019, WatchMojo - one of the largest YouTube channels with over 20 million subscribers and 15 billion views with an extensive library of videos that rely on fair use - released a video that relied on its 10-year experiences managing claims and strikes via Content ID to highlight instances of alleged abuse. In a follow-up video, the channel estimated that rights holders had unlawfully claimed over $2 billion from 2014-19.

The ship was in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy from 1978 to 1997 and today serves as HS Kountouriotis with the Hellenic Navy . The frigate was initially named after Dutch naval hero Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer and then after Pavlos Kountouriotis, distinguished Admiral of the Hellenic Navy, responsible for Greek naval victories in the Aegean Sea that secured the Aegean for Greece during the First Balkan War. The ship's radio call sign was \\"PADA\\". Design and construction In the early 1970s the Royal Netherlands Navy developed a 'Standard' frigate design to replace the destroyers of the and es. The 'Standard' design would have anti-submarine (the ) and anti-aircraft (the ) variants with different armaments on a common hull design. The first eight Kortenaers were ordered in 1974, with four more ordered in 1976, although two were sold to Greece while being built, and replaced by two of the anti- aircraft variant. Kortenaer was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam) of and a draft of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM 3B and two Rolls-Royce Tyne TM 1C gas turbines in a combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement, driving two propeller shafts. The Olympus engines gave a speed of and the Tyne cruise engines gave a speed of . Kortenaers main anti-aircraft armament was an 8-round NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile launcher in front of the bridge. An OTO Melara 76 mm was fitted forward of the Sea Sparrow launcher, while a Goalkeeper CIWS was planned to be fitted aft, on the roof of the ship's hangar. Goalkeeper was not available when the ships were built, however, and Kortenaer was completed with a second Oto Melara 76 mm gun in its place. Eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles could be carried in two quadruple launchers, although two or four Harpoons was a more normal peacetime load-out. A hangar and fight deck were fitted to accommodate two Westland Lynx helicopters, although only one was normally carried. Close-in anti submarine armament was provided by four 324 mm tubes for US Mark 46 torpedoes. A Signaal LW-08 long-range air search radar was fitted, together with a ZW-06 surface- search radar, with WM-25 and STIR-180 fire control radars to direct the ship's armament. A Canadian SQS-505 hull-mounted sonar was fitted. Kortenaers aft Oto Melara 76 mm gun was replaced by a Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun in 1982, and this, in turn, was replaced by the intended Goalkeeper by 1995. On transfer to Greece, the Goalkeeper was removed. Greece replaced it by an American Phalanx CIWS, while Agusta-Bell AB 212 helicopters replaced the Lynxes. HNLMS Kortenaer, the name-ship of her class was laid down at the Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde (KM de Schelde) shipyard in Vlissingen on 8 April 1975. She was launched on 18 December 1976 and commissioned into service on 26 October 1978.

History  The cottages were built for the Makin family, an early commercial family of Berrima. The Makins lived in the eastern section and rented the other. The family ran a store selling groceries, drapery and chemist goods on what is now the site of the local service station. The cottages were subsequently joined into a single dwelling.

The bombings launched on numerous British cities were known as the Blitz. Initially bombed in the summer of 1940, Norwich was subsequently not attacked until April and May 1942 as part of the so-called Baedeker raids, in which targets were chosen for their cultural and historical value and not as a strategic or military target. The most devastating of these attacks occurred on the evening of 27 April 1942 and continued again on 29 April. There were further attacks in May and a heavy bombardment on 26 and 27 June in which Norwich Cathedral was damaged. Norwich Castle, the City Hall and the Guildhall escaped while many residential streets were destroyed. Background An Anderson shelter standing intact amid a scene of debris in Norwich Norwich suffered extensive bomb damage during the Second World War, affecting large parts of the old city centre and Victorian terrace housing around the centre. Industry and rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942; as part of the Baedeker raids; attacks on Bath, Canterbury, Norwich, Exeter, and York using Baedeker's series of tourist guides to the British Isles. Norwich became one of the targets of the so-called \\"Baedeker Blitz\\", which took place in retaliation for the bombing of L√ºbeck by the RAF earlier that year. Lord Haw-Haw made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new City Hall (completed in 1938), although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, Coleman's Wincarnis works, City Station, the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's department store (now John Lewis) and Curl's department store. The large Harmer's clothing factory on St Andrews Street received a direct hit. In 1945 the city was also the intended target of a brief V2 rocket campaign, though all these missed the city. Civil Defence Region bombing reports at National Archive; M J F Bowyer \\"Air Raid\\". Air raids =Early raids= The first raid of bombs occurred on 9 July 1940. Around 5pm, eleven whistling bombs were dropped on the Riverside Works part of the city. On 30 July, many other buildings were hit, including the large Georgian buildings on Surrey Street. Although quite a number of raids were carried out on the city of Norwich in this year, damage to property was mostly confined to residential areas. Many of the raids were at night or in the early morning, but the most damaging visitations, and those that caused many of the casualties, took place in the afternoon or early evening. The city's death-toll for the year amounted to sixty-one, of whom twenty-six were killed on 9 July during the first raid which Norwich sustained. Throughout 1941, twenty more people were killed and twenty eight injured, during monthly attacks on the suburbs and residential areas. =27 April 1942= Raids were being carried out on Exeter, Bath, Canterbury and York, and incendiary bombs were responsible for a large proportion of the damage done. These cities were deliberately selected from the famous Baedeker Guidebooks in which they were marked as cultural locations containing many places of historic and archaeological importance, and were bombed as a direct response to Britain's bombing of the historic German city of Luebeck on 28 March. In Norwich, the raid that began on the evening of 27 April 1942 was the most severe to hit the city during the war, being carried out by bombers of KG2, KG106, who were led by the pathfinders of I/KG100. Two nights later on 29 April, another raid took place, destroying many buildings in the city centre. Two churches were lost on the 27th, St Bartholomew in Heigham and St Benedicts. Both surviving towers still stand today (2019). =June 1942= Known as \\"The Fire Raid\\", three enemy aircraft which were later destroyed, dropped incendiaries and high explosives, causing several large fires. Notable examples included the thatched department store, Bonds, on All Saint's Green as well as the historic Old Boar's Head inn, which were gutted by fire. St Julian's Church in King Street was hit, as well as the Trinity Presbyterian Church in Theatre Street. 20 Timberhill, known as The Star and Crown public house, was destroyed, as was 72 St Giles Street and Heigham Grove. Many 17th century buildings were completely obliterated. Effects Globe Place, Norwich. View through into Globe Place from Walpole Street. Named after the Globe Pub which disappeared, along with much of this densely populated area during the Blitz of 1942 229 citizens were killed in the two Baedeker raids with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war‚Äîgiving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England. Out of the 35,000 domestic dwellings in Norwich, 2,000 were destroyed, and another 27,000 suffered some damage. Fewer than 5,000 houses escaped without any damage at all. Norwich City Station was lost in the bombings, along with large parts of St Stephen's Street. The thatched buildings on All Saint's Green, notably Bond's department store were completely destroyed by fire. In addition, the junction between Barn Road and St Benedict's Street was completely destroyed, with only the city wall surviving. St Paul‚Äôs Church near Peacock Street and Willis Street was destroyed, with the surviving tower being demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the inner-ring road. Curls' Department store in Orford Place which was rebuilt in 1955, and is now Debenhams. St Augustine's School was wrecked, as well as the Norwich Institution for the Blind on Magdalen Street. Ralph Mottram, author of Assault Upon Norwich, stated that \\"those of us who drove through the blazing streets had an unpleasant reminder of old days of Ypres and Armentieres (First World War)\\".

January 1826), was a Moldavian statesman, translator and poet, one of the forerunners of Romanian nationalism. A scion of the boyar elite, he was the eldest son of Vornic Gheorghe Beldiman, and the nephew-in-law of chronicler Enache KogƒÉlniceanu. Alecu himself held high commission in the Moldavian military forces and bureaucracy, but secretly resented the Phanariote regime which had awarded them. He may have affiliated with a loose group known as the \\"National Party\\", championing an alliance between Moldavia's independence from the Ottoman Empire and support for the French Republic. Beldiman's earliest contributions to cultural life probably date back to the 1790s, and originally included translations of French prose and verse drama. He may have contributed an original play, while his brother, Dumitrache Beldiman, helped arrange some of the earliest Moldavian stage performances, as puppet shows. By 1820, Alecu had become the most productive translator in Moldavia, directly contributing to Westernization and the spread of Enlightenment ideas, and also completing a Romanian version of the Odyssey. His works in the field were circulated in print form by Zaharia Carcalechi, or otherwise copied by hand. Beldiman's anti-Greek sentiment peaked during the 1821, when an invasion by the Sacred Band chased him and other Romanian boyars out of Moldavia. The invasion and its violent aftermath inspired him to write the epic poem Tragodiea Moldovei (\\"Moldavia's Tragedy\\"). Although politically significant and comprising picturesque detail, the work was widely dismissed as a sample of exceptionally bad writing. Upon returning home, Beldiman also came into conflict with Prince Ioan Sturdza, who had him imprisoned at TazlƒÉu Monastery in 1824. Poems he wrote during that interval show him as a conservative critic of republican and nationalist propaganda, and display his pity for the lower classes; he was also becoming more supportive of rule by the Ottoman Empire. Though eventually released, he maintained a low profile for the remainder of his life. His family continued to have a role in Moldavian, and later Romanian politics; his grandson Alexandru Beldiman was a journalist. Biography =Origins and early life= According to family tradition, Beldiman's ancestors crossed into Moldavia from the Principality of Transylvania. Lauren»õiu Ungureanu, \\"Boieri mari, episodul 6: Alecu Beldiman, omul care ne-a adus AdevƒÉrul, in AdevƒÉrul, February 18, 2017Bacalov, p. 25; Iacob, p. 293 This would make them distant relatives of the Hungarian Counts of Beldi. The immigrants entered historical record in March 1579, when \\"a certain Beldiman\\" served as Mayor (»òoltuz) of Suceava.Stoicescu, p. 349. See also Iacob, p. 293 In April 1609, Nichifor Beldiman, recorded in some genealogies as a neme»ô (untitled landowner), became Vornic. He later served as Hetman and Logothete,Stoicescu, pp. 349‚Äì350 and, in late 1615, led the boyars into rebellion against Prince »òtefan IX Tom»ôa. He was captured in neighboring Wallachia and beheaded, his remains being disposed of in the Siret River.Stoicescu, pp. 349‚Äì350, 353. See also Bacalov, pp. 88‚Äì89; CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Iacob, p. 293 His two sons continued to hold major boyar ranks, while his daughter married into the PrƒÉjescu family.Stoicescu, pp. 350, 428 During the 18th century, the family lost its economic prosperity and political influence, and came to be regarded as emancipated peasants, rather than as boyars. Isolated in the rural areas of FƒÉlciu County, they were often known by the nickname M√¢nja.Iacob, pp. 293‚Äì295 Alecu Beldiman's grandfather, Grigore M√¢nja Beldiman, rectified the situation. From beginnings as a page at the court of Prince Constantin Cantemir, he became fluent in Ottoman Turkish in Istanbul, where he also befriended Beizadea Dimitrie Cantemir.Iacob, p. 294 In 1711, following the Pruth River Campaign, the Cantemirs were chased out of the country; a Beldiman branch also left Moldavia and settled in the Russian Empire.Bezviconi, p. 177 These events led to the emergence of a Phanariote regime in Moldavia and Wallachia: from ca. 1711, both Danubian Principalities had lost much of their autonomy within the Ottoman Empire; the boyar elite, formed mainly by Greek immigrants, controlled the administration. Grigore M√¢nja survived this time of troubles, and emerged as a favorite of the early Phanariotes: Nicholas Mavrocordatos and Grigore II Ghica both made used of his services. However, his participation in boyar conspiracies during the third reign of Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ endangered his career and his life.Iacob, pp. 294‚Äì295 Alecu's father was Gheorghe Beldiman (1724‚Äì1792). Orphaned of both parents by 1735, he and his four brothers were virtually adopted by the returning Prince Ghica, who groomed them for high office.Iacob, pp. 295‚Äì297 Gheorghe amassed a personal fortune while climbing through the ranks, serving as Stolnic in 1763, Ban in 1773, and finally Vornic in 1790.Iacob, pp. 297‚Äì298 During the Russo-Turkish War of the 1770s, he declared his personal submission to Catherine the Great.Ion Constantin, Ion Negrei, Gheorghe Negru, Ioan Pelivan: istoric al mi»ôcƒÉrii na»õionale din Basarabia, p. 64. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, 2012. He remained a noted figure in the Russophile party, and as a result earned a permanent appointment to the Moldavian Divan in 1774.Iacob, p. 298 His son's birth came during the final stages of the Phanariote era. Alecu was born in 1760, either in Ia»ôi, the Moldavian capital, or in the smaller town of Hu»ôi.CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119 His maternal family was Greek. His mother, Maria, was the daughter of \\"publican Lefter\\" from Istanbul; her sister was married to Enache KogƒÉlniceanu, the Moldavian chronicler and social reformer.Iacob, p. 298. See also Marcu, p. 119 The couple had an older daughter, Anastasia, and three younger sons: Iancu, Filip, and Dumitrache.Iacob, pp. 291, 298‚Äì300 Beldiman coat of arms Early on, Alecu became fluent in Greek and more unusually for his generation, also in French.CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Eliade, p. 335; Marcu, pp. 121, 123 He was educated at home and in private Greek schools‚Äîunlike Dumitrache, who was a graduate of the Princely Academy. He climbed steadily through the boyar hierarchy, becoming Ceau»ô in the Moldavian military forces in 1785; he was Serdar in 1789. At age 34, Alecu became a Paharnic at the princely court of Michael Drakos Soutzos, before being moved to serve as Ispravnic in Neam»õ County. In 1800, under Prince Constantine Ypsilantis, Beldiman was appointed P√¢rcƒÉlab of Gala»õi.Marcu, p. 119 Following his father's death, he became sole owner of several estates. One was Corne»ôti, outside Ia»ôi; two others, Iezereni and Te»õcureni, were in Bessarabia.Iacob, pp. 301‚Äì304. See also Iorga (1912), p. 110 Beldiman was married three times. His first wife, name unknown, was a member of the Romano clan; the second was Ileana, sister of the Logothete and poet Costache Conachi, making him in-laws with Nicolae Vogoride, future Kaymakam of Moldavia.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 55, 85, 980. See also Marcu, p. 119 Beldiman's final, childless, marriage was to Elena Greceanu.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 55, 980 Researcher Nicolae N. Condeescu pushes the beginnings of Beldiman's literary activity into the 18th century, citing him as the uncredited translator of Vincent Voiture's novel, Alcidales et Zelide. In or around 1799, he also probably completed a version of Eustathios Makrembolites and Godard de Beauchamps' Story of Hysmine and Hysminias.Marcu, pp. 122‚Äì123 In parallel, Beldiman became identified as one of the earliest contributors to the popularization of Western theater. The beginnings of Moldavian own theatrical activity are dated to ca. 1800, when Conachi, Nicolae Dimachi and Dumitrache Beldiman produced a short series of puppet shows, with Romanian-language texts.Tatiana Vi»ôescu, \\"√énceputurile teatrului rom√¢nesc cult. Costachi Caragiali ‚Äì O repeti»õie moldoveneascƒÉ sau noi »ôi iar noi\\", in Language and Literature ‚Äì European Landmarks of Identity, Vol. 1, 2005, p. 129 They also wrote a comedy of their own, making Dumitrache's one of Moldavia's first playwrights. Another play, tentatively dated to 1811, was called Serdarul din Orhei (\\"The Serdar of Orhei\\"); historian Nicolae Iorga believes that it was penned by Alecu Beldiman. Dumitrache and Alecu remained interested in both literature and politics; Filip withdrew to a monastery in 1792, while Iancu died later that same decade.Iacob, pp. 299‚Äì300 According to philologist Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, Alecu Beldiman's next translation was from Homer's Odyssey (as Odiseia lui Omir). Andreas Wolf, a Transylvanian Saxon physician, met the Beldimans ca. 1797, praising them as lovers of arts and literature. Bogdan-DuicƒÉ hypothesizes that Beldiman handed his manuscript to Wolf, who took it to Hermannstadt and promised to publish it there.Lascu, pp. 99‚Äì101 It shows the author's familiarity with, and reliance on, the French-style Romanization of Greek, but is above all infused with staples of the Moldavian dialect.Lascu, pp. 101‚Äì104 Another similar text, tentatively attributed to Beldiman, showed up at Dorohoi, near Moldavia's border with the Duchy of Bukovina.Lascu, p. 99 =Literary fame= An unclear tradition claims that one of the Belidimans was involved in a project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia as a single \\"republic\\", with help from Napoleon Bonaparte.Nicolae Iorga, \\"CugetƒÉtori rom√¢ni de acum o sutƒÉ de ani. I. Trei conservatori √Æn epoca de unire »ôi consolidare\\", in Memoriile Sec»õiunii Istorice, Vol. XXI, 1939, pp. 706‚Äì707 Following the Russian invasion of Moldavia in 1806, the youngest Beldiman brother interrupted his literary activities to serve in the occupation government. Alecu's own literary output became more notable following the Russo-Turkish War and the peace of Bucharest. Both Alecu Beldiman and Conachi had been chased out of their Bessarabian estates by the Russian occupation, which ultimately annexed the region as a Bessarabian Governorate; they settled in Ia»ôi as refugees.Bezviconi, p. 202 In 1815, Prince Scarlat Callimachi appointed Alecu an Aga of his citadel in H√¢rlƒÉu. At around that time, he also became involved in the thriving business of inn- keeping, establishing his own taproom in B√¢rlad.Marcel Proca, \\"Hanuri. Istoria evolu»õiei de la han la hotel\\", in Academia B√¢rlƒÉdeanƒÉ, Vol. XXI, Issue 4 (57), Winter 2014, p. 15 Beldiman was advanced to Postelnic in 1818, and finally became the Ispravnic of Ia»ôi in 1819, under Prince Michael Soutzos.Marcu, p. 119. See also CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27 An 1819 map by Giuseppe Bayardi shows that he owned a mansion on Ia»ôi's S√¢rbeascƒÉ Street.Iftimi & VƒÉleanu, p. 45 His estate grew to include parts of Popeni and Vinderei, in Tutova County, as well as several other townhouses in Ia»ôi. He also owned several hamlets populated by Romanies, which he kept as boyar slaves.Iacob, pp. 303‚Äì304 Abel's burial, as illustrated in the 1818 edition of Moartea lui Avel At this new stage, Beldiman blended Romanian nationalism with an interest in modern education, declaring himself a direct contributor to the \\"material progress of the Romanian people\\".CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Eliade, pp. 336, 348 According to historian Neagu Djuvara, Beldiman closely resembles the Wallachian intellectuals of his era, specifically Naum R√¢mniceanu, Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and Zilot Rom√¢nul, in being virulently anti-Greek and anti- Phanariote.Djuvara, p. 88 Scholar Pompiliu Eliade sees the Beldimans and the Sturdzas as affiliates of the \\"National Party\\", which favored independence from the Ottomans and sought direct protection from the French Republic.Eliade, pp. 231‚Äì235, 248, 335 However, Iorga also highlights the limits of Beldiman's nationalism: although he opted to stay in \\"Turkish Moldavia\\", he \\"never wrote as much as a verse, as much as a single line of prose\\" against Russian occupation in Bessarabia.Iorga (1912), p. 171 Likewise, scholar Ovid Densusianu reads Beldiman as a Moldavian particularist, who was generally indifferent to the tribulations of Romanians in Wallachia and elsewhere.Densusianu, pp. 31‚Äì32 Philologist Andreea Giorgiana Marcu notes that, as a translator of Western literature, Beldiman was necessarily a participant in the Age of Enlightenment. He resonated most with Neoclassicism, and especially with its \\"obviously moralizing\\" accounts.Marcu, pp. 119, 121, 123 Likewise, culture critic George Panu proposes that Beldiman and Conachi must have been closely familiarized with, and imitators of, Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna.Panu, p. 165 Over 40 years, Beldiman arguably became the most prolific among Moldavia's contributors to Westernizing translations.Djuvara, pp. 309‚Äì310; Marcu, pp. 119, 121 As noted by Densusianu, Beldiman translated plays that were never intended for actual stage production, since there was no Moldavian theater to speak of.Densusianu, pp. 28‚Äì29 His texts had to introduce theatrical terminology for which there was yet no equivalent: he proposed obraz (\\"cheek\\" or \\"face\\") for \\"character\\", and schini for \\"scene\\".Marcu, p. 122 However, Eliade proposes that Beldiman was directly inspired to write for the stage by witnessing Moldavia's first first-ever theatrical experiment, produced in December 1816 by Gheorghe Asachi.Eliade, pp. 347‚Äì348 By late 1817, Beldiman had completed his own version of Voltaire's Oreste, which was only published in 1820.CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Lascu, pp. 94‚Äì95; Eliade, p. 348 He soon signed contracts with the Wallachian publisher, Zaharia Carcalechi, who was active in the literary circles of Habsburg Hungary.Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119 In 1818, Beldiman also put out √énvƒÉ»õƒÉturƒÉ sau povƒÉ»õuire pentru facerea p√¢inii (\\"A Guide or Advisor to Bread-making\\"), ultimately based on a text by Christian Albert R√ºckert, but directly translated from the Greek version penned by Dimitrios Samurkasis (Dimitrie Samurca»ô).CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Marcu, p. 121 Also that year, Beldiman completed a translation of Salomon Gessner's Der Tod Abels, from the French intermediary. It was published at Buda as Moartea lui Avel.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 55, 980; Densusianu, p. 27; Lascu, p. 94; Marcu, p. 121 Beldiman followed up in 1820 with Istoria lui Numa Pompilie. This was a translation of Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian's Numa Pompilius, though Beldiman suppressed any mention of the real author.CƒÉlinescu, p. 55. See also Densusianu, p. 27; Eliade, pp. 336, 354‚Äì355, 416; Marcu, p. 121 Its preface includes some of the earliest Romanian views on traductology: Beldiman complained about his struggles in adapting early modern Romanian to render complex phrases in French.Eliade, pp. 354‚Äì355; Marcu, p. 123 As noted by linguist Gheorghe IvƒÉnescu, Beldiman followed Iacob Stamati and other Moldavians in adopting a Wallachian spelling for some of his core vocabulary. Istoria consistently used giudecatƒÉ (; \\"trial\\" or \\"judgement\\") for the Moldavianized judecatƒÉ ([ íudekat…ô]).Gheorghe IvƒÉnescu, Probleme capitale ale vechii rom√¢ne literare, pp. 62, 122. Ia»ôi: Editura UniversitƒÉ»õii Alexandru Ioan Cuza, 2012. Beldiman completed numerous other translations, without ever submitting them for print. Various scribes copied them by hand, and they enjoyed popularity in boyar circles. However, Beldiman discovered that the texts were being slowly altered in the process, and decided to create his own authorized copies.Marcu, p. 121 This process involved several younger scribes. One was Ioni»õƒÉ Sion, who took dictation from Beldiman in writing \\"all sorts of verse and stories\\"; he was not paid for the job, but was allowed to make and keep his own copies.Lascu, p. 101 By 1813, Matei Gane of Ciumule»ôti had already collected and transcribed by hand Beldiman's various works.Constantin Gane, Pe aripa vremei, p. 72. Bucharest: Tipografia Steaua, 1923 Beldiman penned, but never printed, other renditions of tragedies and stories by Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost (with Manon Lescaut), Madame Cottin, Pietro Metastasio, Ren√©-Charles Guilbert de Pix√©r√©court, Jean-Fran√ßois Regnard, Louis d'Ussieux, and various unknown authors.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 55, 980; Carda»ô, p. x; Marcu, pp. 119, 121‚Äì122. See also Densusianu, pp. 27‚Äì28; Djuvara, pp. 309‚Äì310; Eliade, pp. 416‚Äì417; Lascu, passim Reportedly, he also finished translated the Iliad, but this work, if it ever existed, remains lost.Carda»ô, p. x; Lascu, pp. 94‚Äì95 =Tragodiea Moldovei= The final stage of Beldiman's literary and political career was marked by the Greek War of Independence, part of which was fought on Moldavian soil. In early 1821, the country was invaded by Alexander Ypsilantis' Greek forces, comprising the Filiki Eteria and the Sacred Band. This occupation forced Beldiman out of Moldavia, and back into Bessarabia.Densusianu, p. 27 The events, which culminated in an Ottoman incursion and a Greek defeat in the Battle of Dragashani, were narrated by Beldiman in his rhyming chronicle. It is most often called Tragodiea Moldovei (\\"Moldavia's Tragedy\\"), but is also known as Eterie sau jalnicele scene prilejuite √Æn Moldova din resvrƒÉtirile grecilor, prin »ôeful lor Alexandru Ipsilanti venitu din Rusia la anul 1821 (\\"The Eteria or Awful Scenes Occurring in Moldavia Because of the Rebellions by Greeks under Their Leader Alexander Ypsilantis, Who Came in from Russia in 1821\\"). According to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, the work was unintentionally \\"buffoonish\\", reading like a \\"humorous rigmarole\\".CƒÉlinescu, pp. 53‚Äì55 The overall result ran at 4,260 lines of verse which, CƒÉlinescu argues, was of an \\"old-fashioned type\\" and \\"monotonous\\", similar to later works by Constantin Negruzzi.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 54, 210 Alexander Ypsilantis crossing the Prut River into Moldavia; allegory by Peter von Hess Scholar Gheorghe Carda»ô views Beldiman as the final Moldavian representative of a \\"prolix, untalented\\" school of poets, which began in 1681 with the anonymous Chronological Poem of the Moldavian Rulers.Carda»ô, pp. ix‚Äìx Similarly, Densusianu notes that Beldiman demanded from his readers a patience that he never repaid. He was \\"not a poet, but only a versifier, and as such one in a string of mediocre writers.\\" Moreover, his genre of choice, the \\"rhyming chronicle\\", was \\"unrewarding\\" and \\"manically\\" over-detailed, though he remained overall superior to Zilot, his Wallachian contemporary.Densusianu, pp. 29‚Äì30 According to Eliade, Tragodiea is a \\"long and tedious newspaper article, prosaic as no prose has ever been, amusing only because the author himself realizes that his work is so very difficult, and his ability so very limited.\\"Eliade, pp. 335‚Äì336 Eliade also finds that, being no longer disciplined by foreign grammar (as he was in his translations), Beldiman constructs incoherent phrases. His vocabulary is \\"flooded\\" with Greek, Ottoman, or Slavonic terms.Eliade, p. 355; Marcu, p. 123 According to historian Vlad Georgescu, Beldiman was still notable as the most erudite chronicler of his generation.Georgescu, p. 174 As CƒÉlinescu writes, an \\"entertaining jolt\\" in the epic came wherever Beldiman described his contempt for various of his contemporaries: the \\"godless dog\\" Vasileios Karavias and the haughty but \\"so very cowardly\\" Stefan Bogoridi.CƒÉlinescu, p. 54 Complex descriptions remain rare, as Beldiman often dismisses the Eterists and his other adversaries with just one epithet, sometimes bordering on the obscene.Densusianu, p. 30 One line refers to a \\"Lividi Nicolaki, that base and ugly soul\\", who, according to Beldiman, had been appointed commander of Moldavia's Romanies by Ypsilantis' government. Researchers are unsure about whether this is a reference to Niccol√≤ Livaditti, a Triestene painter.Sorin Iftimi, Corina Cimpoe»ôu, Marcelina Br√Ændu»ôa Munteanu, Niccolo Livaditi »ôi epoca sa (1832‚Äì1858). ArtƒÉ »ôi istorie, p. 21. Ia»ôi: Palace of Culture, 2012. Other aspects of the narrative were also polemical, reflecting Beldiman's brand of conservatism. In one episode of his epic, Beldiman sides with the local Turks, whom the Eterist invasion had decimated.Xenopol, p. 34 Another one of his stanzas lambasts Tudor Vladimirescu, leader of the parallel uprising in Wallachia. As noted by CƒÉlinescu, Beldiman and Vladimirescu were both Romanian nationalists, but of different visions; the Moldavian poet described the Wallachian revolutionist as \\"deceitful\\", prone to demagoguery.CƒÉlinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 32. See also Georgescu, pp. 185‚Äì186 Historian A. D. Xenopol also notes that Beldiman was sarcastic in his treatment of the Moldavian republican boyars, whom he called Decemviri.Xenopol, p. 78 The restoration of Ottoman rule was rendered complete by the Eterist defeat at Sculeni in June 1821. Beldiman, having been appointed Vornic,Georgescu, p. 169 made the return trip to Ia»ôi. In November, he purchased the townhouse owned by a fellow boyar, the Wallachian Iordache Filipescu, in PƒÉcurari neighborhood; it was here that he finished writing Tragodiea.Iftimi & VƒÉleanu, p. 26 His poem-chronicle purposefully refrained from documenting the entirety of Ioan Sturdza's reign, which began in 1822.CƒÉlinescu, p. 54; Densusianu, p. 33 One stanza circulates the notion that Sturdza was a \\"son of Moldavia\\", rather than a Phanariote, and expresses his belief that a \\"golden century\\" would follow.Densusianu, p. 31 The Vornic soon returned to championing his version of boyar nationalism: in Tragodiea, he makes explicit references to the \\"national interest\\".Georgescu, pp. 169, 182‚Äì184, 187, 189‚Äì190 From 1823, Beldiman preserved a copy of what he claimed to be Moldavia's Capitulation to the Ottomans, outlining the ancient rights of its inhabitants. The text expanded on earlier forgeries.Georgescu, p. 186; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13‚Äì14, 19‚Äì22, 33‚Äì34 Overall, he was more pro-Ottoman than Zilot and other chroniclers, being above all thankful that the Empire had defeated Ypsilantis.Georgescu, pp. 186‚Äì187 =Death and legacy= In reality, Beldiman was at odds with the new regime. As one of the more conservative boyars, he clashed with the monarch. In March 1824, with Dimachi and others, he authored a letter of protest against Prince Sturdza, which was addressed to his overlord, Sultan Mahmud II.PungƒÉ, p. 224 During the same year, he was briefly imprisoned for his disobedience.Xenopol, p. 101 Confined inside TazlƒÉu Monastery, he produced his final set of poems, Stihuri (\\"Verse\\"). These are patriotic in tone, but noticeably skeptical of nationalism, explaining that, even though the Phanariotes had lost power, bad customs survived through native boyars; unusually in his context, he sided with the lower classes against the aristocrats.Densusianu, pp. 32‚Äì33 Several lines refer to the harsh conditions faced by travelers, noting that rainstorms had rendered infernal his trip to TazlƒÉu.Ion Ionescu, \\"Podurile √Æn Rom√¢nia\\", in Natura. RevistƒÉ pentru RƒÉsp√¢ndirea »òtiin»õei, Issue 4/1936, p. 7 Stylistically, the Stihuri resemble both Neoclassicism and early Romantic poetry, introducing elements later found in works by Barbu Paris Mumuleanu.Marcu, p. 120 Beldiman was ultimately released and made a discreet return to politics, living in relative seclusion for the rest of his life. His last published translation came out in 1824. It was a first volume of William Coxe's Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark, taken from a French version by Paul Henri Mallet. He died in January 1826, or at, earliest, December 1825Iacob, p. 299‚Äîaccording to fellow writer Dimitrie Pastiescul, he still held a pen in his hand when this occurred. Buried at his family's favorite church of Talpalari, Beldiman left a large number of manuscripts, which were reportedly sold by the pound to a local collector.CƒÉlinescu, p. 55 Both Dumitrache and Filip survived their brother's death, the former dying in 1831. Filip, better known under his monastic name \\"Filaret\\", was appointed Bishop of Roman and carateker of the Moldavian Metropolis. In 1842, he served as administrator of Moldavia, filling in for Prince Mihail Sturdza.PungƒÉ, p. 246 From his Romano marriage, Alecu had a daughter. Known as either Pulheria or Profira, she married into the Cantacuzino family.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 55, 980; Djuvara, p. 355; Iacob, p. 299 She was famous for raising her husband's illegitimate son, the half-Romani DincƒÉ, who was formally her house slave. Her refusal to manumit him, and his subsequent suicide, resulted in mass support for abolitionism.Djuvara, pp. 276‚Äì278 Alecu's son, Vasile Beldiman, married a Mavrocordatos.Narcis Dorin Ion, \\"Istorie »ôi genealogie. Convorbiri cu domnul Mihai Dim. Sturdza\\", in CercetƒÉri Istorice, Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 306CƒÉlinescu, p. 980; Iacob, p. 299 His only notable public office was that of Caretaker (Epitrop) of Moldavian schools. His wife Elena sold the Beldiman house in PƒÉcurari to boyar Lupu Bal»ô; it changed hands and served various functions until being demolished in 1966. Vasile died in 1853, and was survived by a son, Alexandru Beldiman, who was the head of Romanian Police and close friend of the Principalities' first Domnitor, Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In this capacity, he failed to prevent Cuza's toppling in 1866, and came to oppose the regime of Carol I, founding the left- wing newspaper AdevƒÉrul. Corne»ôti, still owned by this branch of the family, was passed to poet Dimitrie Anghel, and later to the Mavrocordatos.Iacob, p. 303 Iordachi Beldiman, sometimes described as Alecu's son,CƒÉlinescu, p. 162 was in fact one of his nephews, born to Dumitrache Beldiman. Iordachi married Catinca Dimachi, daughter of the writer. She was made famous by her affair with poet Alexandru Hrisoverghi; according to one account, Hrisoverghi died after jumping out a window in Iordachi's townhouse.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 93, 162‚Äì163 Also a Vornic, Iordachi was noted for commissioning a gallery of portraits of Moldavian Princes.Sorin Iftimi, \\"Chipurile domnitorului Alexandru Moruzi √Æn portrete din secolul XIX\\", in CercetƒÉri Istorice, Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 179 During the United Principalities era, he became a leading figure in Ia»ôi's conservative circles, helping Iacob Negruzzi establish the political review Constitu»õiunea.Iorga (1934), p. 62 Alecu's niece, Maria or Marghioala, was a locally famous philanthropist, married to politician Scarlat Miclescu. Their son, Dimitrie S. Miclescu (1820‚Äì1896), participated in the 1848 revolutionary movement, as well as being a published poet. He became a noted agitator on the far-left of Romanian liberalism and renounced all claim to boyar privilege, including his family name.\\"Dumitru Scarlat Miclescu\\", in Gazeta Transilvaniei, Issue 270/1896, p. 5 Beldiman's translations continued to be read by young intellectuals in all Romanian-speaking areas: Constantin N. BrƒÉiloiu, who went abroad to study in 1828, ordered copies of Oreste and Istoria lui Numa Pompilie, \\"so as not to forget his language\\".Lauren»õiu Vlad, \\"C√¢teva date despre educa»õia unui t√¢nƒÉr boier valah.

For decades, Tragodiea circulated in 23 handwritten copies, two of which were respectively owned by Nicolae BƒÉlcescu and Alexandru Odobescu. In the 1840s, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu set himself the task of printing Beldiman's writings and documents as part of an anthology.CƒÉlinescu, p. 177; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13, 19‚Äì20 As Eterie sau jalnicele scene, Tragodiea was eventually printed in 1861, at the expense of an Alecu Balica; it was reissued in 1875 as Tragedia Moldovei.CƒÉlinescu, p. 980. See also Densusianu, p. 29; Marcu, p. 120 By then, poet Vasile Alecsandri was actively campaigning for Beldiman to be included into the Romanian literary canon,Iorga (1934), pp. 179‚Äì180 while philologist Alexandru Lambrior unsuccessfully proposed to set the Romanian literary standard exclusively on words used by Beldiman and Conachi.Panu, pp. 171‚Äì173 Beldiman's work was finally rediscovered in the 1890s. One of its promoters was the antiquarian George Ionescu-Gion, who insisted that Beldiman was without philosophical merit, but a genuine patriot.Rodica Florea, \\"Reviste »ôi scriitori √Æn ultimele douƒÉ decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea\\", in »òerban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne.

Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1973 The same belief was expressed in 1910 by Xenopol, according to whom Beldiman was not significant as a poet, but voiced the \\"national sentiment in all its freedom\\".

He is regarded as being the one of the leading racing greyhounds in history and won the sports ultimate prize, the English Greyhound Derby. Profile =1942= Ballyhennessy Seal was whelped in April 1942, by Lone Seal out of Canadian Glory. He was bred and reared in Tralee, by L C O'Connell. =1943= His first trial and race was in June, at Tralee Greyhound Stadium. After he won a sweepstake, he was sold to England for ¬£50 and raced at Catford Stadium for his new owners, Mrs F Stow and Mr E A Vivian. Within two weeks of his arrival he won the 18th Rochester Stakes, his first competition and races in England. He soon earned the nickname 'The Seal' and won his 1943 Puppy Derby heat at Wimbledon Stadium, by 14 lengths, in a time of 28.88 seconds. In the final he lost by a short head to Allardstown Playboy. Con Stevens (the Wimbledon Racing Manager) introduced a new invitation race for puppy champions and the invitation went out to Allardstown Playboy; Dark Tiger, the Trafalgar Cup winner; Erlegh Hero, winner of the British Produce Stakes, Model Dasher, the Midland Puppy Derby winner, and Fawn Cherry, winner of the Irish Puppy Derby. Model Dasher was subsequently withdrawn injured, which allowed Ballyhennessy Seal a place in the race. 'The Seal' was fast out the traps and led all the way to win by one and a half lengths in 28.99 seconds. =1944= In the early part of 1944 he was moved from his training base at Catford, to be trained by Stan Martin at Wimbledon. He set a new track record at Stamford Bridge in the May Stakes, when recording a world record time of 27.64 seconds for the 500 yards course. Following this was an appearance in the Circuit at Walthamstow Stadium and another two new track records were set, in the semi finals (28.62) and final (28.59). In addition to the Circuit he won the Wembley Summer Cup, the Stewards Cup and the International and reached the final of the Eclipse. =1945= In 1945 'The Seal' won the Wembley Spring Cup and then sealed his most prominent competition victory to date, when winning the 1945 Gold Collar at Catford in impressive style winning his heat and semi final by eight lengths. Ballyhennessy Seal was then aimed at the sports ultimate prize, the 1945 English Greyhound Derby and the competition started at White City on 16 June. The Seal went to the traps in heat two priced 4-5f but he missed the break and could not catch Magic Bohemian losing by 2¬Ω lengths. Despite the defeat, Ballyhennessy Seal completed a routine victory in the first semi final winning by three lengths at odds of 4-5f. In the final Ballyhennessy Seal led all the way with Rhynn Castle staying prominent throughout, Duffys Arrival and Celtic Chief impeded each other with Magic Bohemian finishing well to take third. After a short break Ballyhennessy Seal returned to action in the Laurels and progressed through the competition with ease but was then reported to be suffering from rheumatism in his hind legs. He was subsequently withdrawn because he did not respond to treatment and was then retired to stud. In 1946 he demanded ¬£100 for a mating fee at the Burhill Kennels.

Shkiryatov (1938) Matvei Fyodorovich Shkiryatov (Russian: –ú–∞—Ç–≤–µ–π –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –®–∫–∏—Ä—è—Ç–æ–≤; 15 August 1883 ‚Äî 18 January 1954) was a Communist Party official and functionary who rose to power in the Soviet Union during the rule of Josif Stalin. His entire career was spent imposing party discipline through the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Though far less well known than successive chiefs of the Soviet police, such as Nikolai Yezhov or Lavrentiy Beria, he was arguably as steeply involved as either of them in the repression during the Stalin years. Unlike them, escaped arrest or public notoriety. Early career Matvei Shkiryatov was the son of a peasant, born in a village called Vishnyakovo, in Tula Province. He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and worked in the illegal party organisation in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Tula. He was arrested repeatedly, but avoided being deported to Siberia or held in prison for very long. There is no evidence that these arrests were for political activity. He was drafted into the imperial army in 1915. After the February Revolution, he was elected to the executive of the Moscow and Tula soviets. In 1918-20, he was secretary of the Moscow branch of the Garment Workers' Union. Party official In 1921, Vladimir Lenin ordered a purge of the communist party, to remove unsuitable individuals who had joined during the chaos of the civil war. Shkiryatov was transferred to the staff of the Central Control Commission (CCC) to assist. At first, he was rooting out drunkards, criminals and other undesirables, but soon progressed to purging those who opposed Stalin on political grounds, which became his life's work. He was a member of the Praesidium of the CCC, 1923‚Äì34, and secretary of the CCC 1923-24 and 1930-34. In 1927-34, he was also of a member of the board of Rabkrin. In 1934, the CCC was reorganised, and renamed the Party Control Commission. He was its secretary in 1934-39, its deputy chairman in 1939-52, and a member of its praesidium until his death in 1954. He was also a member of the Central Committee of the communist party from 1939. Role in the purges In January 1933, the Central Committee heard a case presented by Shkiryatov and the CCC Chairman Jan Rudzutak against a group of Bolsheviks who had had a private meeting at which they had discussed the crisis in the countryside, including mass starvation known in Ukraine as Holodomor caused by Stalin's policy of forcing peasants to move onto collective farms, and had talked about removing Stalin from office. Shkiryatov claimed that this could only mean that they were plotting an act of violence against Stalin. He also attacked the Old Bolshevik A.P. Smirnov, a party member since 1898, who had not taken part in the conversation but knew those involved. Shkiryatov challenged to prove that he did not sympathise with the opposition. Smirnov and the others were expelled from the party, and later shot. In 1933, the novelist Mikhail Sholokhov wrote a long, angry and detailed letter to Stalin about mass starvation in his home district of Veshenskaya, near Rostov, and about the abusive behaviour of named police officers. Shkiryatov was sent to the region in May 1933 with instructions to placate Sholokhov, whose work Stalin valued, and after a ten-day investigations, recommended that two men whom Sholokhov had accused of torturing prisoners should be shot, and two other officials sacked. The death sentences were commuted. In May 1935, Shkiryatov headed the commission which forcibly disbanded the Society of Old Bolsheviks, whose members had bene collecting signatures for a petition against using the death penalty against former party members who opposed Stalin's line. In February 1937, Shkiryatov again acted as a prosecutor at a plenum of the Central Committee, when the two of Lenin's former comrades, Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov were accused of having plotted against Stalin. He declared: \\"What makes you think, Bukharin and Rykov, that leniency will be shown to you?...We cannot limit ourselves to merely expelling them from the party...They must be prosecuted.\\" Both men were later put on trial, and shot. Early in 1938, he was sent to the North Caucasus to purge the local party and ordered the arrests of the head of the NKVD in Rostov and Ordzhonikidze (Vladikavkaz) and many others, and the dismissal of the local party boss, Yefim Yevdokimov, and once again to investigate complaints raised by Sholokhov that innocent communists were being persecuted in the region. In 1939, he was put in charge of investigating the communist youth league, Komsomol, and sent Stalin a memo suggesting that the head of the organisation, Alexander Kosarev, should be reprimanding, adding: \\"If something is not right, you will correct me.\\" Kosarev was arrested and shot. In January 1948, Shkiryatov was one of the officials present at a famous conference in the Kremlin to which the leading Soviet musicians, including Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev were summoned to be lectured on how to write music for a societ audience by Stalin's cultural chief, Andrei Zhdanov. Reputedly, on the second day, Shkiryatov noticed that Prokofiev, the composer of Peter and the Wolf was talking, and ordered him to pay attention. Prokofiev retorted; \\"I never pay attention to people who haven't been introduced to me.\\" In December 1948, after the creation of the state of Israel had led Stalin to suspect that there were Jewish nationalists operating secretly in the USSR, Shkiryatov and the police chief Viktor Abakumov drew up a report denouncing Polina Zhemchuzhina, Jewish head of textile and wife of Vyacheslav Molotov for her links to the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. She was exiled to Kazakhstan. = Personality = Leon Trotsky wrote an uncompleted note about Shkiryatov - \\"crushed, submissive, slightly drunken workingman. Little Shkiryatov would tell Lenin: 'Go away, don't bother us, or we'll burn you\\" but his long career demonstrated that he was ruthless, and humourless. In 1933, he warned that communists should not make jokes, because jokes were \\"sharp weapons\\" and \\"jokes against the party are agitation against the party\\". The historian A. Vaksberg wrote: \\"M. F. Shkiryatov - one of the most vile Stalinist apparatchiks, whose name, with full reason, stands in line with Yezhov and Beria. A long-time figure in the highest control organs of the party, who directed party cleansing and beating Party cadres. Worked hand in hand with the NKVD-MGB, had his \\"own\\" prison, where he personally interrogated especially important prisoners. He died without waiting for his conviction in any form.\\" Shkiryatov died of a heart attack.

The 'Standard' design would have anti-submarine (the ) and anti-aircraft (the ) variants with different armaments on a common hull design. The first eight Kortenaers were ordered in 1974, with four more ordered in 1976, although two were sold to Greece while being built, and replaced to two of the anti-aircraft variant. The Kortenaers were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam) of and a draft of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM 3B and two Rolls-Royce Tyne TM 1C gas turbines in a combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement, driving two propeller shafts. The Olympus engines gave a speed of and the Tyne cruise engines gave a speed of . Callenburghs main anti-aircraft armament was an 8-round NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile launcher in front of the bridge. An OTO Melara 76 mm was fitted forward of the Sea Sparrow launcher, while a Goalkeeper CIWS was planned to be fitted aft, on the roof of the ship's hangar. Goalkeeper was not available when the ships were built, however, and Callenburgh was completed with a second Oto Melara 76 mm gun in its place. Eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles could be carried in two quadruple launchers, although two or four Harpoons was a more normal peacetime load-out. A hangar and fight deck were fitted to accommodate two Westland Lynx helicopters, although only one was normally carried. Close-in anti submarine armament was provided by four 324 mm tubes for US Mark 46 torpedoes. A Signaal LW-08 long-range air search radar was fitted, together with a ZW-06 surface- search radar, with WM-25 and STIR-180 fire control radars to direct the ship's armament. A Canadian SQS-505 hull-mounted sonar was fitted. Callenburghs aft Oto Melara 76 mm gun was replaced by a Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun in 1982, and this, in turn, was replaced by a prototype Goalkeeper installation in September 1984. On transfer to Greece, the Goalkeeper was removed. Greece replaced it by an American Phalanx CIWS, while Agusta-Bell AB 212 helicopters replaced the Lynxes.

During the 1745 Jacobite Rising, he successfully defended Fort William in March 1746 and later conducted the search for Prince Charles after Culloden in April. He gained a reputation for atrocities and reprisals against Highlanders and has been described as one of the most notorious 'Redcoats' of the Rebellion. In October 1752, he transferred to the East India Company as Engineer General of their settlements in India, based in Calcutta, modern Kolkata; he died of fever in Madras, modern Chennai, on 12 May 1754. Life Caroline of Ansbach (1683-1737), mother of the Duke of Cumberland Caroline Frederick Scott was born in 1711, one of three sons of James (or George) Scott and Marion Stewart (1679-1727), daughter of Sir James Stewart (1635-1715). A Presbyterian radical sentenced to death for his role in the 1685 Argyll's Rising, Sir James was appointed Lord Advocate of Scotland in 1692; his son, also named James, was Solicitor General. Originally from Edinburgh, James Scott was a close friend of George I, then Elector Hanover and between 1710 to 1724 held senior diplomatic posts at various German courts. Hanover's involvement in the Great Northern War made this an extremely sensitive and important position and James was closely involved in negotiations to end it. After her husband died in 1726, Marion moved to the Dutch Republic, so her children could attend Leiden University. Scott's unusual first name came from his godmother Caroline of Ansbach (1683-1737), wife of George II and mother of the Duke of Cumberland. Relationships and loyalties were very complex; political Whigs, both Stewarts opposed the 1707 Union, while Scott's cousin, the economist James Steuart, was exiled for his part in the 1745 rebellion. His elder brother George (1708-1780) was appointed tutor to the future George III, on the recommendation of former Jacobite minister Viscount Bolingbroke. Scott never married but left his property to Martha Bowdler, who is assumed to be mother of his four children, three girls and a boy, also named Caroline Frederick (ca 1752-1794). Little is known of his daughters; his son served in the Royal Artillery, was invalided out in 1793 and died in Rochester in 1794. Career Fort William, foreground,Ben Nevis behind ca 1890 In 1737, Scott was commissioned as a cornet in the Royal North British Dragoons, then based in England, before transferring to Guise's Regiment in 1741. During the 1739 to 1748 War of Jenkins' Ear with Spain, Guise's was sent to the West Indies where it took part in the attack of May 1741 on Cartagena de Indias. The expedition was a disaster, the assault force suffering losses of between 80-90%, mostly from dysentery and yellow fever. The survivors returned to England in December 1742; the unit was brought up to strength as a result of the 1740-1748 War of the Austrian Succession, then sent to Scotland for garrison duties. Although technically an officer of Guise's, Scott served in Gibraltar as a military engineer under the Earl of Albemarle and when the 1745 Rising began, he was in Flanders with Cumberland. In July, detachments from Guise's secured the forts between Inverness and Fort William; two companies were captured at the Battle of Prestonpans in September, some of whom changed sides and were later executed as deserters. A letter written by his brother George mentions Scott was among the troops sent to Scotland after Prestonpans. After withdrawing to Inverness in February 1746, the Jacobites captured Fort Augustus in early March, leaving Fort William as the last government-controlled position in the Great Glen.Duffy, Christopher. (2007). The '45, Bonnie Prince Charlie and Untold Story of the Jacobite Rising. pp. 452 - 458. . Cumberland appointed Scott commander and he arrived there on 15 March; like Fort Augustus, its defences had been neglected but it was far stronger and better sited. Control of the sea meant it could be resupplied, while naval vessels moored in Loch Linnhe gave the defenders more firepower than the besiegers. Jacobite commander Colonel Stapleton considered the position too strong to be taken with the forces available. Scott's diaries show he conducted an energetic and aggressive defence and the siege made little progress. At the end of March, Stapleton was ordered back to Inverness and on 3 April, the garrison discovered the Jacobites had gone, leaving guns and heavy equipment behind. Scott's defence was praised by the Duke of Newcastle in a letter to Cumberland on 17 April. State Papers of Scotland III, 30, #20; Newcastle to Cumberland 17 April 1746 Braemar Castle, one of the strongpoints established to control the Highlands; Scott commanded here until the end of 1749 Following the Battle of Culloden on 16 April, Scott led one of the parties searching for Prince Charles; on 21 June, he landed at Kilbride, on Skye, only just missing the Prince who was two miles away. In the course of this, he gained a reputation for brutality and excess; many stories about him were recorded by the antiquarian Alexander Carmichael in the 1860s. One alleges three Highlanders who surrendered to him were drowned in a mill flume at Lochoy, although there is no direct confirmation of this. Royle, p.111 In 2011, Scott was included on a list of alleged war criminals by a group seeking an apology for crimes committed after Culloden. Why he remains so notorious is unclear, since destruction and theft of property and livestock was common practice on both sides. The repression that followed Culloden reflected a widespread mood in the army and was conducted by senior commanders like James Wolfe, Henry Hawley and John Huske. Colonel Whitefoord, Sir Walter Scott's model for the heroic Hanoverian Colonel Talbot in Waverley, wrote suspected rebels were 'immediately put to death...their houses plundered and burnt, cattle drove, ploughs and tackle destroyed.' Royle, p.118 One reason for this was a widespread perception among government officials and Jacobites another landing was imminent. However, Scott clearly had a strong dislike of Highlanders and Jacobites, as demonstrated by his treatment of Isabel Haldane. Royle, p.112 Her husband was Charles Stewart of Ardshiel, who led the Stewart of Appin regiment at Culloden and was exiled as a result. In a letter of complaint to John Campbell, Earl of Loudon, Isabel records Scott's men cut down her fruit trees, removed her furniture, food stores and livestock. They also dismantled her house, the materials later being sold at Fort William for ¬£400. Anderson, p. 333 Fort William, Calcutta, ca 1735; Scott drew up plans for improving it but died before they were implemented In November 1746, Scott was promoted major, replacing his colleague Hugh Wentworth, dismissed for surrendering Fort Augustus. Anderson, p. 270 Albemarle was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Scotland and supervised actions taken to control the Highlands. After the Rising, the military road network begun in 1715 was completed and garrisons placed at key points, the main ones being Inversnaid and Braemar Castle, commanded by Scott. As well as regular patrolling, they enforced the Disarming Act, permitting the confiscation of weapons, and the Dress Act, banning Highland dress unless worn on military service. Reports submitted by Scott record weapons found and arrests of those in 'Highland dress'; the latter caused considerable frustration, since local law officers routinely accepted claims by defendants they were simply 'dyed blankets'. He was relieved at the end of October 1749.Allardyce (1895). p. 528. Shortly afterwards, he transferred to the 29th Foot, which had just returned to Ireland from Nova Scotia; by 1751, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel, based in Philipstown, now Daingean. The poor performance of the British military in the War of the Austrian Succession resulted in a focus on army reform; under the name 'Mr Lovetruth', Scott published a number of letters on the topic. In October 1752, Scott joined the military service of the East India Company and appointed Engineer-General for all their settlements in India and Major Commandant of Fort William, Calcutta. He reached Calcutta in September 1753, where he began construction of new gunpowder mills and drew up detailed plans for improving Fort William's fortifications. He died of fever on 12 May 1754 visiting Madras, now Chennai; the works were still in progress when Fort William was captured in 1756. Ensign Scott, who accompanied him from England and is assumed to be a relative, was taken prisoner and died in what is known as the Black Hole of Calcutta.

Retrieved on September 9, 2018.) is a Jordanian-American convicted murderer held on Texas death row. He was sentenced for the murders of Iranian-American activist Gelareh Bagherzadeh (), a friend of one of his daughters; and his son-in-law, Coty Beavers, in Greater Houston. Multiple media reports described the crimes as honor killings. Background =Ali Irsan and his family= Ali Irsan was born to a father in the Jordanian Army. Irsan, using a student visa, came to the United States in 1979, and became a naturalized United States citizen. He lived on a property in a rural area, in unincorporated eastern Montgomery County, Texas, near Conroe. - The address quoted in the article shows that the house was in an unincorporated area. Craig Malisow of the Houston Press stated that Irsan \\"considered himself to be a devout Muslim.\\" Irsan studied in a \\"medical laboratory\\" program at Kirkwood Community College. He stated in court filings that he studied in a medical program at a tertiary institution in Jordan, and he also stated that he had a Houston Community College \\"diploma of auto -mechanic\\". Irsan, then 22, married his first wife when she was 17. He and Robin Dahl first met in 1979 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa while he studied in community college and she worked on her GED. They married circa 1980, and moved to the Houston area by 1984. The couple had four children, with their first being born in 1981. In 1994 Irsan divorced his first wife. When Irsan was 35, he traveled to Jordan and entered into an arranged marriage with a girl, Shmou Ali Alrawabdeh (), who was approximately 15 or 16. His first wife left the house shortly after he married his second wife. Alrawabdeh, a Jordanian national,\\"Coordinated Effort Results In Multiple Charges Against Jordanian National And Family Members.\\" U.S. Department of Justice. May 23, 2014. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. arrived in the U.S. circa 1995. In federal court, Irsan stated that he married her in Jordan but that he did not legally marry her in the United States. Alrawabdeh had eight children with him while they lived in the United States; including those from his other wife, the total number of children fathered by Irsan is 12. She naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2001. In 1999 Irsan killed Amjad Hussein Alidam (), the husband of Nasemah Rachelle Irsan (), Irsan's eldest daughter, at Irsan's residence. Alidam was an Iraqi immigrant to the U.S. and a Shia Muslim. Irsan stated that he did the killing in self-defense. Irsan never received criminal charges in that case, as area law enforcement believed him to be innocent. A Montgomery County grand jury did not indict Irsan for his murder. Nasemah was sent back to Jordan. =Nesreen Irsan Beavers, Nadia Irsan, Gelareh Bagherzadeh, and Cory Beavers= Two of Irsan's daughters, Nadia (), and Nesreen (), were children of the previous wife. Nadia is a U.S. citizen, and the family previously educated them through homeschooling. After Irsan suffered a heart attack and was diagnosed with a heart condition, Nesreen and Nadia were able to convince their father to allow her and her sister to go to medical school to become doctors to ensure their father‚Äôs health would be properly maintained. To their surprise, Irsan allowed Nadia and Nesreen to enroll in a tertiary institution, a biology program at Lone Star College- Montgomery. Candace Strang, a professor at Lone Star who taught the women stated that, as paraphrased by Malislow in a Houston Press article, Nadia and Nesreen \\"fought hard to convince their father to let them enroll\\". While there, Nesreen and her older sister, Nadia, met Coty Beavers and his twin brother, Cory, there. Beavers was a Christian while the girls were Muslims; at the time both girls wore hijab. Within a few months, the girls began taking off their hijabs and wearing makeup at school. Nesreen very quickly fell in love with Coty Beavers, and the two began secretly dating. While Nesreen initially had the help and support of her big sister, Nadia, after Nadia‚Äôs romantic feelings for Coty‚Äôs twin brother, Cory, were not returned, Nadia quickly became jealous of her sister‚Äôs new relationship and quickly retreated back into the role of dutiful daughter to Irsan. The two women and Cory Beavers were admitted to the molecular genetics program at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in the Texas Medical Center; at MD Anderson Nesreen met Bagherzadeh, an Iranian. Bagherzadeh, a medical student and medical researcher, had molecular genetics as her area of study. She was born in France and was from Tehran. She studied biology in Tehran and later attended university in Budapest, Hungary, before moving to Houston in 2007 to join her parents, who bought a house near Uptown Houston (the area around the Houston Galleria) so she could live there; this residence was within the Woodway Point townhomes, and an area street would become the site of her death. Nesreen introduced Coty Beavers‚Äô twin brother, Cory, to Bagherzadeh. Bagherzadeh publicly protested in favor of women's rights on numerous occasions and criticized the Iranian government. She participated in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests that were held in Houston and also protested against the Al-Hadi Mosque, which she accused of being connected to the Iranian government. Lomi Kriel of the Houston Chronicle wrote that \\"she was outspokenly critical of Islam, even becoming embroiled in an argument with her father's bosses about their faith.\\" She was a member of Second Baptist Church, as she had converted to Christianity in 2011. When Nesreen chose to leave Islam and become a Christian, Bagherzadeh gave her support, and Bagherzadeh also suggested that Nesreen marry her love, Coty Beavers. Nesreen and Coty Beavers became romantically involved in secret after meeting in 2011 while enrolled at Lone Star-Montgomery. Brian Rogers of the Houston Chronicle stated that Nadia felt jealousy over her sister Nesreen‚Äôs relationship with Coty Beavers, especially after Nadia‚Äôs feelings for Coty‚Äôs twin brother, Cory, were not reciprocated; Irsan told his daughters that they were not allowed to date. According to court testimony, Irsan threatened the girls with death if they engaged in romantic relationships, and also stated he would kill their boyfriends if that were ever the case. (the apartment complex was the place where Beavers died) According to Texas prosecutors, Nadia wished to be in a relationship with Cory Beavers, but he declined. The relationship between Nesreen and Nadia deteriorated. Nesreen later found employment at MD Anderson. =Kidnapping, escape, harassment, and marriage= Irsan learned about Nesreen's relationship to Beavers while he was in Jordan. In June 2011 Alrawabdeh held her against her will at Irsan's residence; Nesreen accused Nadia of also holding her against her will. The persons/people holding her captive had discovered e-mails, text messages, and voice mails sent to and from Coty Beavers on Nesreen's communication device. She escaped through a window and went to be with Beavers at his residence, then his mother's house in Spring. In November 2011 Cory Beavers and Bagherzadeh became romantically involved. Nesreen stated she was afraid that her father would harm her. Her father and other members of the family looked for her and sent messages to Bagherzadeh, who refused to divulge the information. He remained unaware of the location of her residence. Beginning around fall 2011, Irsan harassed Nesreen, Coty Beavers, and Bagherzadeh, and the group experienced acts of vandalism against their property. Nesreen, who was 23 at the time, got a protective order that banned her father from contacting her, but he continued to look for her. For those reasons she chose not to attend the graduation ceremony for her class. Circa July 2012, Nesreen married Coty Beavers, taking the name Nesreen Irsan Beavers, and only holding a civil ceremony to avoid getting unwanted attention, doing so at the Harris County Courthouse. The two moved to a new residence a significant distance away from their previous one; they were at the Legacy Park Apartments in unincorporated northwest Harris County, which would become the site of Beavers' death. (the address is shown to give a precise location of the crime scene) Nesreen and Beavers chose a gated apartment complex specifically for their protection, and they rented a third-floor unit to minimize their possibility of being attacked. Whenever Nesreen left the apartment to travel to and from work, Beavers escorted her to protect her. He also had an assault rifle in case he needed to use self- defense. In an interview with the Houston Chronicle, Nesreen stated that historically law enforcement in the Houston area had difficulty with honor crimes because they did not understand the culture and the ramifications for violating honor codes. =Federal fraud convictions= Nesreen told authorities that Irsan had committed fraud related to Social Security. The family received money from the Social Security Administration (SSA), called Supplemental Security Income (SSI), for people who are unable to work and do not have resources, but Irsan and his family concealed their resources even though he told the government that beginning in 1990 he was unable to find work. Irsan held his money in multiple bank accounts, with some under the names of his children while having de facto control over them, while also claiming benefits and hiding the true amount of money he controlled. He also possessed multiple false credit cards, some under false names and some in the names of family members. The criminal schemes began in 1995. Agencies investigating included multiple agencies in the federal, state, and local levels, among them the FBI, SSA, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Homeland Security Investigations, and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. A group of police, with the FBI leading, arrested Irsan, Alrawabdeh, and Nadia on May 22, 2014, accusing them of offenses related to fraud perpetrated against the social security system. Irsan was held in the Joe Corley Detention Facility/Joe Corley Processing Center, a private correctional facility in Conroe, Texas, operated by the GEO Group which, in addition to housing immigration prisoners, acts as a detention center for the U.S. Marshals Service. All three suspects were also held at Federal Detention Center, Houston in Downtown Houston. Federal authorities did not allow him to post bond; Alrawabdeh and Nadia were also held. Six of Irsan's children who were still minors were put in the custody of child protective services (CPS). The prosecuting federal attorneys were Jim McAlister and Mark McIntyre. Lawyer John Floyd represented Irsan in regard to his federal prosecution. The FBI raided the house another time on June 5, 2014. Irsan was initially charged with conspiracy to benefits fraud in a continuing scheme, defraud the United States, and theft of public money over $1,000. On April 3, 2015, Irsan pleaded guilty,\\"Conroe Family Handed Federal Prison Sentences.\\" U.S. Department of Justice. July 6, 2015. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. to \\"conspiracy to defraud the United States\\", while Alrawabdeh and Nadia were convicted of \\"making false statements\\".\\"Conroe Family Guilty Of Disability Fraud.\\" U.S. Department of Justice. April 3, 2015. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. All were sentenced to serve time in the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Irsan received a federal sentence of 45 months and a fine of $290,651 from Judge Lynn Hughes. Alrawabdeh and Nadia each received 24 months. The arrests and prosecutions were not covered in the Jordanian news media. Murders =Bagherzadeh's murder= Bagherzadeh was murdered while in her father's car, outside of her parents' residence on January 15, 2012. Bagherzadeh was 30 at the time of her death. The triggerperson, using a .38 caliber handgun, shot Bagherzadeh through Alrawabdeh's passenger side window, hitting Bagherzadeh in the head with one bullet that went through the passenger side window of the car she drove. Alrawabdeh stated that Nasim Irsan (), Irsan's son, was the triggerperson. Bagherzadeh was driving from the residence of her boyfriend Cory Beavers to her parents' residence, (the street names and numbers establish the precise locations of the crimes: the second occurred in an unincorporated area; Bagherzadeh's parents have since moved away) while talking on the telephone with a former boyfriend. Up to three other bullets were fired at her car. Her car hit a townhouse's garage, and police found her body around 12:30 AM; a shooting had been first reported around 11:45 PM.\\"Investigation into Fatal Shooting at 894 Augusta Drive.\\" Houston Police Department. January 17, 2012. Retrieved on September 11, 2018. Prosecutors stated that Irsan; Alrawabdeh; and Nasim Irsan were together in a car. At 12:30 A.M. a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) officer stopped the car going 79 miles per hour, above the speed limit, on Interstate 45, while it was going back to Montgomery County. Irsan was given a warning and allowed to leave after he stated he was trying to get a drink to deal with a diabetic condition. Initially no leads were announced, and Crime Stoppers stated that there was a $250,000 reward for information that could solve the case. Craig Malisow of the Houston Press described the award as \\"record-high\\". This became the highest reward in U.S. Crimestoppers history. Shortly after the killings, Bagherzadeh's allies and friends believed that the Iranian government had Bagherzadeh assassinated. Authorities had questioned Ali Irsan, as Nesreen had stated he was a culprit, but authorities did not keep him in custody as they had not obtained proof. =Beavers's murder= Coty Beavers was murdered at his residence at the Legacy Park apartments, on November 12, 2012. According to Alrawabdeh, Irsan personally shot Beavers. He had entered the apartment while it was unlocked and stayed inside while Beavers was with Nesreen; Beavers went with her to her car, before she drove away to her workplace, around 5:45 A.M. Irsan shot him after Beavers re-entered the house. Irsan was in hiding inside a bedroom before he killed his victim, 28 at the time of his death, with five or more bullets. Alwarabdeh was also present at Beavers's murder. According to court testimony, Irsan had anticipated that Nesreen would be with him and intended to kill her too. Nesreen found Beavers's body, at about 4:30 P.M. Two days prior to the killing, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO), a suspect asked people in Legacy Park for the whereabouts of Beavers. Cory Beavers stated to the news channel KPRC that his brother \\"said basically if I'm ever killed or murdered it was Ali Irsan. I mean he was that specific about it.\\" Beavers's mother, Shirley McCormick, stated in Irsan's state trial that \\"We knew who was responsible, but we didn‚Äôt know who all had helped him. I told [the police officers] it was Ali Irsan, and he also had to be the one who killed Gelareh.\\" =Motive= Prosecutors of the Harris County government stated that Nesreen's conversion and marrying a Christian man motivated the father to commit the murders. In her court testimony, Alrawabdeh stated that Irsan planned to also kill Nesreen, Cory Beavers, and the Beavers twins' mother. She stated \\"If a girl ran away from home, it would bring disgrace to the family.\\" Stating that the difference in religion and the element of premarital sex would reflect poorly on Irsan, Alrawabdeh stated, \\"I‚Äôm from an Arabic country and I‚Äôm aware of the culture. The family would kill her to clean their honor.\\" According to prosecutors, Irsan wished to kill Nesreen's loved ones first to inflict emotional distress on her, before killing her at a later date. Devon Anderson, the Harris County district attorney in 2015, stated that Irsan \\"believed that [Nesreen] and others, including the two victims, had violated his honor as a Muslim.\\" Prosecution =Investigation, arrest, and pre-trial detention= Officers of the Harris County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) searched Irsan's residence nine days after Beavers's death. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted surveillance on the suspects. On the day Irsan was arrested for federal fraud charges, May 22, 2014, Harris County prosecutors announced that Irsan was also being charged for Bagherzadeh's murder. By March 2015 those charges were dismissed, but the Harris County authorities stated they would file additional charges. Harris County district attorney Anderson did not say why the initial charges were dropped with newer ones later filed; Michael Barajas of the Houston Press stated \\"It appears that decision was purely strategic\\". After prosecutors established the connection between the two killings, new capital murder charges against Irsan were filed on April 22, 2015, charging him for the murders of both Bagherzadeh and Beavers. According to Texas state law, capital murder can be filed if two killings are connected as part of the same scheme. Irsan's lawyers stated that he had no connection to either murder and the circumstances of the murders were not known. They also stated that the murders of Bagherzadeh and Beavers were not connected. The federal government continued to hold Irsan, Alrawabdeh, and Nadia while Harris County prosecutors announced new criminal charges in 2015. Nadia Irsan received charges accusing her of stalking her sister, a felony to the third degree; the maximum possible sentence, if convicted, would be 10 years. Prosecutors can file murder charges against her if they find that she had helped plan any murders, due to the rule of parties statutes. Nasim, charged with Bagherzadeh's murder, was arrested on April 22, 2015 and subsequently moved to the Harris County jail; he was 21 at the time. His bail was set at $500,000. Alwarabdeh also was charged with Bagherzadeh's murder, as she had allowed the triggerperson to use her window to kill Bagherzadeh. By May 1, 2015, Nadia remained in federal incarceration while her father and stepmother were moved to the Harris County jail. In the courtroom, Irsan asked for the state to not notify the Jordanian government, citing that he was a citizen of the United States. Later in 2015 Nadia was moved to the Harris County Jail, and she was given house arrest in January 2017 with a $250,000 bail. Texas State District Judge Jan Krocker scheduled Nadia's stalking trial for July 2017. In the meantime Krocker chose house arrest since Nadia had only been accused of stalking. After state criminal charges had been announced, an anonymous person claiming to be one of Irsan's children created a petition stating that \\"racial prejudice and discrimination\\" had victimized the family. While Montgomery County authorities stated they were re-investigating the 1999 death of Alidam, they would only file charges on the matter if new evidence was presented. =Murder trial and sentencing= The Bob Casey Federal Courthouse in Downtown Houston, the site of the capital murder trial of Ali Irsan, prosecuted by the State of Texas Allan B. Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas houses the State of Texas death row for men. Irsan's capital murder trial began on June 25, 2018. It was held at the Bob Casey Federal Courthouse in Downtown Houston. The normal venue for state felony cases, the Harris County Criminal Courthouse in Downtown, had sustained damage from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and the post-storm restoration was not yet complete. The prosecutors sought the death penalty against Irsan, making it the first death penalty prosecution in Houston in 2018, and also the first death penalty case during the tenure of Kim Ogg, the Harris County district attorney since January 1, 2017. Anna Emmons, Marie Primm, and Jon Stephenson were appointed special prosecutors, since Ogg's first assistant, prior to the beginning of the murder trial, represented a suspected co-conspirator in another case; Ogg recused. Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte were attorneys appointed by the judge to represent Irsan, while Katherine Scardino was the attorney appointed for Alrawabdeh. Jan Krocker served as the state district judge. Nesreen testified against her father, as did Cory Beavers, who lost his twin brother and girlfriend, and McCormick, who lost her son. Alrawabdeh entered into a plea deal that gave her a conviction of kidnapping instead of murder, and as part of the plea deal she testified against Irsan. Alrawabdeh was to be released with time served after the end of the trial. In 2019 prosecutors stated that her case is still open so long as she has additional testimony to give. In addition Dahl testified against her first husband, and first daughter Nesemah testified against her father. Two younger sisters of Irsan flew from Jordan to the U.S. to testify in his favor. Other relatives resident in Jordan used Skype to communicate with the court. Arabic translators translated testimony from people who lacked English fluency. Two sons of Irsan also testified in favor of their father. Even though his lawyers asked him not to, Irsan testified in his own trial. Irsan was declared guilty on July 26, 2018. The jurors came to this conclusion after 35 minutes of deliberation. In the punishment phase, which lasted two weeks, the jury deliberated between two possible outcomes for a capital murder conviction under Texas law: life without parole or the death penalty. Prosecutors presented a witness who accused Irsan of boasting about murdering Alidam without consequence in 1999. Nesreen testified that Irsan used severe corporal punishment, and that he praised the September 11, 2001 attacks and suicide bombings while living in the United States. On Tuesday, August 14, 2018, Irsan received a death sentence. The jury held a deliberation for nine hours before reaching the sentence. Irsan went into the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) on August 20 of that year. His head and beard were shaved due to TDCJ policy. Men sentenced to death under Texas law are normally held at the Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas.\\"Death Row Facts.\\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. =Subsequent developments= In August 2019 Nasim Irsan, already in correctional custody for more than four years, reached a plea deal: he pleaded guilty to murder instead of capital murder and received a 40-year sentence, with time off for time already served. He may apply for parole around 2039. Alwarabdeh refused to testify against Nasim, and prosecutors stated this complicated their case against him. In November 2019 prosecutors filed a charge of conspiracy to commit murder against Nadia, with the potential sentencing range, if convicted, from 15 years to life imprisonment. She refused a potential plea deal which involved the stalking charge being dropped. Marie Primm, who served as the prosecutor pro tem, stated that this filing was not due to the addition of new facts, but rather due to where \\"the evidence took us.\\" Aftermath and analysis Governor of Texas Greg Abbott wrote on Twitter that people who commit honor killings in Texas would be sentenced to death. Brian Rogers of the Houston Chronicle stated that experts considered the case to be unusual because usually only the offending woman is killed in an honor killing, and that the Irsan affair increased attention given to honor killings in the United States. Michael Creed, another brother of Coty Beavers, said \\"You don‚Äôt have to be Muslim to be a victim of an honor crime. These are not infrequent events that happen in some random part of the world. They‚Äôre happening in America and they‚Äôre on the rise.\\" Beavers's father, Dennis Beavers, also stated \\"If we in this country are not careful, a tragedy like ours could happen to your family.\\" Relatives of Coty Beavers and Bagherzadeh stated that they became more fearful after the murders, with Cory and another brother of Beavers having guns for protection. On January 23, 2012 Bagherzadeh's funeral was held at Second Baptist Church. Her parents sold their Houston house and moved to Maryland, where their eldest son lived. Ebrahim Bagherzadeh, Bagherzadeh's father, stated that being in Houston reminds them of their daughter and makes them feel sad. The Houston Crimestoppers Memorial in Midtown Houston has a memorial to Bagherzadeh. Nesreen suggested that law enforcement allow potential victims of honor killings to change their identities to avoid being tracked down by vengeful family members. In media The case was covered in the episode \\"Deadly Dishonor\\" in season two of the television program A Wedding and a Murder. Dateline NBC also had a two- hour episode airing in November 2019.

It is overlooked by the Christ Church to the east on Brunswick Road. The square is surrounded by terraced houses and flats with the Gloucester National Spiritualist Church on the north side and Gloucester House on the south side. There are nine grade listed buildings around the square. The square has been part of the Eastgate and St Michaels conservation area since 1968. History The square dates back to the Roman era when it was known as the Gaudy Green, which originated from the Latin term \\"Gaudium\\" which means to enjoy. Archaeological excavations of the site have found a Roman graveyard to the north, next to the Chillingworth Mews housing estate, which is likely to have extended into the square. Albion Street to the west is also believed to be of Roman origin. During the Elizabethan era, the city's stocks were present on the green. It was also used for leisure, as archery was practised here. In 1643, an army camp was established on the green by the King's troops during the English Civil War. Prince Rupert led the royalist troops in a siege of Gloucester which was parliamentarian at this time. From the green the royalists dug tunnels under the city walls to where Parliament Street is today. Three large cannons were also placed on the green and fired at the south gate of the city walls. In the mid-1700s, the green was a red light district. At this time it was classed as the parish of Littleworth, which was the poorest region of the city. The houses were slums with no sanitation. The opening of the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal in 1827 and the development of Gloucester Docks bought more money into the city, so the green was sold by its then owner the Duke of Norfolk to private buyers. Between 1822 and 1825 the area was developed by Thomas Reece, an ironmonger. By 1825, 19 terrace houses had been built with the central area preserved as a garden. All the residents signed a deed of covenant on 15 April 1825 to ensure nothing could ever be built on the garden. The area became known as Brunswick Square, named after Caroline of Brunswick, the wife of George IV. A managing group to maintain the garden was also formed and is known as the Brunswick Square Central Lawn Association. During World War II, the area became run-down and, in 1942, the metal railings were removed to support the war effort. In the 1960s, the city council wanted to turn the square into a car park, however the deed of covenant signed in 1825 prevented this from happening. In 2000, a ¬£25,000 grant from the Gloucestershire Environmental Trust and Cory Environmental was used to restore the gardens. Royal Visits On the 3 June 1909, Edward VII visited the square; it is believed around 10,000 school children were there to meet him. In the 1930s Princess Mary visited the YMCA at 18 Brunswick Square.

In 1086, Domesday Book listed 25 tenants in the parish including a priest, at which time it was held by Eldred, Archbishop of York, who had bought it from Earl Godwin in 1061. =St George's Church= The parish church of St George is a 12th century Norman church built around 1125. Until around 1740 it was dedicated to St Matthew. Between 1868 and 1871, the incumbent, Rev W Wiggins, had the interior walls stencilled in a colourful medieval style.

He was one of the best European colts of his generation in 2009 when he was unbeaten in three races including the July Stakes and the Prix Morny. He failed to win in two races as a three-year-old and was retired at the end of his second season. He has stood at a breeding stallion in Ireland and Italy and has had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Arcano is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by the Yellow Bird Syndicate. As a yearling in October 2008 he was offered for sale at Tattersalls and bought for 90,000 guineas by the bloodstock agents McKeever St Lawrence on behalf of a group of owners headed by members of the Sangster family. The colt was sent into training with Brian Meehan at Manton in Wiltshire. He was sired by Oasis Dream, a sprinter who won the July Cup and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2003 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Jwala, Charming Thought, Goldream, Midday, Power and Muhaarar. Arcano's dam Tariysha was an unraced mare bred in Ireland by the Aga Khan. She was a female-line descendant of the outstanding French sprinter Texana. Racing career =2009: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Arcano started the 7/2 second favourite for a maiden race over six furlongs on good to firm ground at Newbury Racecourse on 11 June. Ridden by Martin Dwyer, he took the lead a furlong out and held off the challenge of the John Gosden-trained Showcasing (later to win the Gimcrack Stakes) to win by a head. On 9 July the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in which he was again partnered by Dwyer and was made the 7/4 favourite against ten opponents. After tracking the front-running Orpen Grey, he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length with a gap of three lengths back to Red Jazz in third. Shortly after the race the colt was acquired privately by Hamdan Al Maktoum. The Prix Morny over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 23 August attracted a field of five runners and saw Arcano, ridden by Richard Hills, start the second choice in the betting behind his fellow English challenger Canford Cliffs (winner of the Coventry Stakes). The other three runners were Special Duty (Prix Robert Papin), Zanzibari (Prix de Cabourg) and Dolled Up (Prix du Bois). After being restrained at the rear of the field as Special Duty set the pace, the colt began to make rapid progress in the last 300 metres and took the lead in final strides. In a \\"blanket finish\\" Arcano won by a short neck and a neck from Special Duty and Canford Cliffs with Dolled Up and Zanzibari also finishing within a length of the winner.

The winning time of 1:07.90 was a new course record. In the official rating of 2009's European two-year-olds Arcano was given a rating of 118, making him the fourth-best juvenile of the season behind St Nicholas Abbey, Passion for Gold and Jan Vermeer, and level with Canford Cliffs, Siyouni and Vale of York. =2010: three-year-old season= Almost eight months after his last start, Arcano began his second campaign in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury in April. He started at odds of 2/1 in a five-runner field but sustained his first defeat as he came home third behind Dick Turpin and Canford Cliffs. On his only subsequent race Arcano was dropped in class and distance for a minor event over six furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 31 July. He started the 10/11 favourite but finished last of the five runners behind Vitoria. Stud record Arcano was retired to stud to become a breeding stallion in Ireland before moving to Italy in 2016. The best of his progeny have included: Just Glamorous (Prix du Petit Couvert), Tajaanus (Sweet Solera Stakes), Another Touch (Pomfret Stakes), Abel Handy (Cornwallis Stakes) and Grey Britain (Fairway Stakes).

Lady Charlotte was the first of twenty-one 'ladies of quality and distinction' who signed Thomas Coram's first petition, presented to King George II in 1735, calling for the establishment of the Foundling Hospital.  Biography  Lady Charlotte was a daughter of Daniel Finch, 7th Earl of Winchilsea and 2nd Earl of Nottingham, by his second wife, the former Anne Hatton. She married the Duke of Somerset on 4 February 1726, and the marriage was not a happy one. He was known as \\"The Proud Duke\\", and is said to have reproached her, after she had gently tapped him on the shoulder with her fan, with the words: \\"Madam, my first wife was a Percy and she never took such a liberty\\". The duke had for some years been corresponding with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, now widowed, and continued to write to her after remarrying.  Age controversy  Burke's Peerage lists Lady Charlotte's year of birth as 1711, making her just 14 years old when she married the 63 year old Duke.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Page 3680. However, correspondence between one of her descendants and the curator of the Foundling Museum's 2018 exhibition, \\"Ladies of Quality & Distinction\\", cites the family bible, which gives her year of birth as 1693. This is also the birth year engraved on her grave stone.  Family  Seymour already had children from his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Percy, who died in 1722. By Charlotte he had two further children: * Lady Frances Seymour (18 July 1728 ‚Äì 25 January 1761), who married John Manners, Marquess of Granby, and had children. * Lady Charlotte Seymour (21 September 1730 ‚Äì 15 February 1805), who married Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Aylesford, a distant cousin, and had children. The duke was a strict father, and required Lady Frances and Lady Charlotte to stand and watch him taking his afternoon nap. If he woke and found that one of them was not paying attention, he threatened to disinherit her. Copies of letters sent by Charlotte to her father are held in the National Archives. In Eliza Haywood's 1726 satire, The Secret History of the Present Intrigues of the Court of Carimania, the duchess is referred to under the pseudonym of \\"Euridice\\", while the duke was \\"Doraspe\\". The duke died at the family seat of Petworth House in 1748, aged 86. Lady Charlotte died on 21 January 1773.  The Foundling Hospital  In his efforts to establish the first Foundling Hospital, Thomas Coram approached ladies of nobility to support his petition to King George II. Lady Charlotte, Duchess of Somerset, was his first signatory, signing the petition on 9 March 1729 at Petworth. It is not known how Coram was introduced to Lady Charlotte, although Ruth K. McClure in her book 'Coram's Children, The London Foundling Hospital In The Eighteenth Century' suggests that it may have been through Henry Newman, secretary of the SPCK of which Coram was also a member, who had previously spent five years in the service of the Duke of Somerset. In his notebooks, Coram noted the date on which each of the lady petitioners signed in a list captioned 'An Exact Account when each Lady of Charity Signed their Declaration'.Thomas Coram pocket book, Foundling Hospital Archive: The papers of the Foundling Hospital from 1731 to the late twentieth century at the London Metropolitan Archives, volume 98.

Ramos, a gold badge chair umpire certified by the International Tennis Federation, is one of only two persons to have chair umpired a singles finals match in all four of the Grand Slam tournaments, the other being Alison Hughes. Ramos is also notable for umpiring many other high-profile matches and for penalizing several high- profile players during his decades-long career.  Career  Ramos' Wimbledon finals debut as chair umpire came at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships ‚Äì Men's singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In 2008 he chair umpired the match in which Venus Williams defeated her sister Serena Williams at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships ‚Äì Women's Singles. In 2012 he chair umpired the London Olympics final between Andy Murray and Roger Federer, making Ramos the only umpire to have chair umpired a singles final at all four Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympics. He has also officiated a number of matches in the Davis cup. A highly experienced umpire, Ramos developed a reputation for strict adherence to rules, to the point of being described as a \\"stickler\\". According to tennis experts, Ramos is one of the few umpires who isn't afraid to call a rules violation against elite players. =Grand Slam Finals= Ramos has been in the chair of a number of Grand Slam finals during his career which include: * 2005 Australian Open ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2005 French Open - Women's Singles * 2007 Wimbledon Championships ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2008 Australian Open ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2008 French Open ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2008 Wimbledon Championships ‚Äì Women's Singles * 2011 US Open ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2014 Australian Open ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2016 Australian Open ‚Äì Men's Singles * 2018 US Open ‚Äì Women's Singles  Controversies  Ramos has issued violations to several high-profile tennis players who then objected to Ramos' penalties. = 2016 French Open = During the 2016 French Open, Ramos issued a code violation to Nick Kyrgios after the latter shouted at a ball boy about a towel during a match. Kyrgios continued to clash with Ramos after the violation was issued, stating later that Ramos was operating on a double standard since Kyrgios claimed his opponent (Marco Cecchinato) was also committing violation- worthy offenses. = 2016 Summer Olympics = At the 2016 Summer Olympics Ramos issued a code violation to Andy Murray after Murray criticized Ramos' \\"stupid umpiring\\". = 2017 French Open = During the 2017 French Open, Andy Murray received two time violations from Ramos, the second of which was a loss of first serve. Murray noted that he indeed had been in violation of the controversial time rule and described Ramos as a \\"very good umpire\\", but he criticized the penalty. Ramos also gave Novak Djokovic a loss of first serve after Djokovic committed multiple time violations. Djokovic then yelled to himself in Serbian and flipped a tennis ball at a ball boy behind him, leading to Ramos penalizing him for unsportsmanlike conduct. = 2018 US Open = At the 2018 US Open women's singles final between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, Ramos gave Williams three code violations. Williams' first code violation was a warning for receiving coaching during the match (Williams' coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, later admitted to coaching using hand signals, though he noted the rule against such signals was not always enforced). Williams contested this, stating her coach had only given her a thumbs-up and reassuring Ramos that she never gets coaching or cheats. Later in the match, Williams intentionally broke her racket against the ground, incurring a second code violation from Ramos, which was a point penalty. Williams continued to argue with Ramos between games, first asking and then demanding he apologize for implying she was cheating by getting coaching, and then telling him, \\"You stole a point from me\\". Willams then told Ramos: \\"You will never, ever, ever be on another [tennis] court of mine as long as you live ... You owe me an apology. Say it. Say you‚Äôre sorry . . . How dare you insinuate that I was cheating. You stole a point from me. You're a thief, too.\\". This exchange resulted in Ramos issuing Williams a third code violation for verbally abusing the umpire, which awarded a game to Osaka. Play was then stopped, and Williams called the tournament referee and supervisor onto the court, but the two officials upheld Ramos' violations. Williams went on to lose the match to Osaka 6‚Äì2 6‚Äì4. Williams was fined $17,000 for the violations. After the match Williams accused Ramos of sexism by claiming that men were not penalized in the same manner for the same conduct she was accused of. While Williams' claim was backed by the WTA and Billie Jean King, Williams' behavior was criticized by the US Open (which issued the $17,000 fine), and the ITF. Martina Navratilova provided a complex analysis of the incident, largely critical of Williams' outburst, but not dismissive of the possibility of a general double standard in tennis. Some observers noted that Williams as a player should have been experienced enough not to lose control of her emotions as she was well aware of the potential for a third violation, and there was also criticism that Williams was acting like a diva \\"bigger than her sport\\". The International Tennis Federation (ITF) supported Ramos, stating his \\"decisions were in accordance\\" with the Grand Slam Rulebook Code of Conduct which players agree to adhere to‚Äîspecifically Article III: Rule P of the Grand Slam Rulebook which forbids players from making a verbal remark towards an official that \\"implies dishonesty\\", such as \\"liar\\" and \\"thief\\".

Payne House, also known as the Payne Mansion, is a Victorian house in the Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, California, United States. Built in 1881 and designed by William Curlett in a mix of Stick, Eastlake, and Queen Anne styles, it survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It has been adapted to house a hotel and a restaurant. House The Theodore Payne House was designed by William Curlett and his brother-in-law Theodore Eisen The authors give the date of completion as 1882. in a blended Victorian style, with Stick, Eastlake, and Queen Anne elements. It is the last of several mansions along its section of Sutter Street, and one of the few surviving upper-class houses from before the 1906 earthquake and the ensuing fire. It was built with modern conveniences including heating, hot and cold running water, and indoor toilets, and had a porte coch√®re (now removed), many bay windows, and an open octagonal candle-snuffer turret. The interiors include Tiffany stained-glass windows. History The mansion was built in 1881 for Theodore Fryatt Payne, whose father, also called Theodore Payne, had become wealthy in the Gold Rush and who made his own fortune manufacturing nuts and bolts, and his wife Mary Pauline O'Brien, who inherited the largest share of her uncle William S. O'Brien's silver fortune from the Comstock Lode. A March 1882 article in a builders' magazine projected the cost of construction at $16,500; both the lot and the building contract were in Mrs. Payne's name. The Paynes moved out of the city after the 1906 earthquake to Menlo Park, where they had a house built out of reinforced concrete; Theodore Payne died in 1907 and his widow sold the San Francisco house in approximately 1909, after which it was owned by Edgar and Ida Anderson and by 1933 had become a Japanese YMCA. In about 1940 it became Karl Lengfeld's antiques store, a use that continued into the late 1960s and involved some alterations to the interior. It has also been the headquarters of the San Francisco Medical Society and an alcoholism treatment center; in the 1990s it was available for rent as a wedding venue. Its exterior having been little altered, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 2011 it was purchased by Jing Yao and her husband, Chinese hotel entrepreneurs who converted it into their first venture in the United States, a ten-room hotel oriented toward Chinese business travelers called Leader House. Leader House and a Chinese restaurant on two floors within the building received the necessary city permissions in late 2013 but never opened; instead it was operated as the Payne Mansion Hotel, the most expensive Airbnb rental in San Francisco at $10,000 a night for the entire building. It was bought in 2018 by Bernard Rosenson, a Southern California hotelier, and late that year the Mansion on Sutter hotel opened there, with a French restaurant named 1881.

He was a forefather of the late medieval powerful Marcali family. Family Gregory was born in the first half of the 1240s. He originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) P√©c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was the eldest son of Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Gregory had four younger brothers, Mark II, Stephen, Lucas III and Apor.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus P√©c 1. Zala branch) Stephen was the ancestor of the Berzencei (or Musinai) family and its cadet branches, the Lor√°ntfis and S√°ndorfis.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus P√©c 3. Berzencei [Musinai] branch) Lucas was isp√°n of Zala County, while Apor was considered an influential baron at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. Their cousin was Denis, the most notable member of the clan. Gregory had a son Joachim from his marriage to an unidentified noble lady. Joachim was referred by written records from 1311 to 1321. His castle at Szentgy√∂rgy (also called B√©kav√°r, lit. \\"Frog's Castle\\") was besieged and captured by Andrew K≈ëszegi around 1315. Through his only grandson Stephen, Gregory was the forefather of the powerful Marcali family, which became prominent in the 15th century. The family died out in 1487.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus P√©c 2. Marcali branch) Career Gregory is first mentioned by a royal charter in 1266, which refers to him as isp√°n of Rojcsa (today Rovi≈°ƒáe, Croatia), which laid in the territory of Kri≈æevci (K≈ër√∂s) County and belonged to the dominion of B√©la, Duke of Slavonia. In this capacity, he participated in the Bulgarian campaign, which took place in that year. When Duke Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria, taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, they crossed the Danube in 1265 and raided the Hungarian fortresses north of the river which belonged to Stephen's realm. In response, after B√©la IV and his son Stephen signed the peace treaty on the Rabbits' Island, the rex junior, with the limited support of B√©la's royal army, invaded Bulgaria in the summer of 1266. The main army seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts, while another army commanded by Gregory P√©c routed the Bulgarians in Vrchov (or Vracsa). In the same time, Egyed Monoszl√≥ led Stephen's army to successfully besiege and capture Tirnovo, also plundering the surrounding areas. Historian Attila Zsoldos considers the intention behind the appointment of the young Gregory as leader of one of the involving armies was to give him opportunity to demonstrate his military skills. Duke Stephen, a talented military leader, has been trying to build personal relationships with those noblemen, who arrived to Bulgaria from his father B√©la's dominion. His political career reached its peak during the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary, whose rule was characterized by feudal anarchy, when many groupings of barons ‚Äî primarily the Cs√°ks, K≈ëszegis, and Gutkeleds ‚Äî fought against each other for supreme power. When B√©la of Macs√≥ was murdered by Henry K≈ëszegi and his soldiers following a sharp dispute around 15 November 1272, his province, the Duchy of Macs√≥ was divided among the members of the leading noble families. Gregory P√©c became Ban of Barancs and Kucs√≥ (present- day Braniƒçevo and Kuƒçevo in east-central Serbia, respectively), first mentioned in this capacity on 27 November. He still held both dignities on 14 May 1273. However, both banates proved to be short-lived administrative units. He was succeeded by Stephen, son of Tekesh as Ban of Kucs√≥ in 1279, while the region of Braniƒçevo was ruled by two Bulgarian nobles, brothers Darman and Kudelin shortly after Gregory's last appearance as ban. Gregory fought against the troops of Ottokar II of Bohemia, who invaded the borderlands of Hungary in April 1273. He participated in numerous clashes against the Moravian army alongside his kinsmen, Denis and Benedict. Gregory served as isp√°n of Somogy County from June to September/December 1275. He regained the office around July 1276, holding the position until the same month of the next year. He functioned as judge royal around September 1288, during the last regnal years of Ladislaus IV. It is possible that he held the dignity until the next year, when he was succeeded by Amadeus Aba. Following Ladislaus' assassination in 1290, Gregory was considered a confidant of Andrew III of Hungary. His inherited and acquired lands laid in the borderland of domains of two oligarchic powers, the Cs√°ks and the K≈ëszegi family, thus his political, social and financial status were constantly at risk. It is plausible that he built the castle of Szentgy√∂rgy in order to protect his landholdings against the K≈ëszegis. He was made isp√°n of Bars and Nyitra counties in 1291 to represent the royal power in the dominion of the Cs√°k clan. When Andrew III and Albert of Austria jointly invaded the K≈ëszegis' lands and their main fort at K≈ëszeg in August 1296, Gregory participated in the military campaign. This is the last relevant information about him. Following Andrew's death in 1301, he retired from public life, if he was still alive at all. According to a non- authentic charter dated July 1309 (in fact it was written a century later), he acted as an arbiter in a lawsuit between the Tengerdis and the Somogyv√°r Abbey.

He received his PhD from Wisconsin in 1999 and has taught at Duke University ever since. He became a fellow of the Econometric Society in 2018. Arcidiacono is known for his research contributions to three fields: affirmative action in higher education, structural estimation of dynamic discrete choice models, and college major choice, having written survey papers on each topic. He has also published papers on peer effects, racial discrimination, the minimum wage, and marriage markets. Education and career Peter S. Arcidiacono was born in Oregon in 1971. He graduated from Tigard High School in 1990, completed a B.S. in Economics in 1993 at Willamette University, and received his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1999 under the supervision of John Kennan. Arcidiacono has spent his entire academic career at Duke University (assistant professor, 1999‚Äì2006, associate professor, 2006‚Äì2010, and full professor, 2010‚Äìpresent). Research and contributions =Affirmative action in higher education= Arcidiacono's research on affirmative action in higher education has centered on the theme that there exists a trade-off between institutional quality and the fit between a school and a student. Thus, students who are admitted under affirmative action may be made worse off due to lack of academic preparation. Arcidiacono's expertise in this field led to his being hired as an expert witness in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. UNC lawsuits. =Dynamic discrete choice models= Arcidiacono, along with Robert A. Miller and John Bailey Jones, is the co-developer of using the Expectation‚Äìmaximization algorithm and conditional choice probabilities (CCPs) to simplify the maximum likelihood estimation of structural econometric models. These methods allow a researcher to estimate the structural parameters of an economic model in stages because of additive separability in the objective function. Additionally, CCPs allow the researcher to estimate the structural parameters without having to fully solve the agent's dynamic decision problem. Both approaches result in substantial computational gains. =College major choice= Arcidiacono's work on college major choice has used dynamic discrete choice models to understand how much student decisions are driven by future labor market earnings versus other factors, such as academic ability, enjoyment of college coursework, or future occupational match. He has also used elicited expectations models to answer similar questions. Professional service Arcidiacono has served in several editorial positions since 2007: * Co-Editor, Quantitative Economics, (July 2016‚Äìpresent) * Foreign Editor, Review of Economic Studies (October 2011 ‚Äì October 2017) * Associate Editor, Journal of Applied Econometrics, (January 2007‚Äìpresent) * Associate Editor, AEJ: Applied Economics, (May 2009 ‚Äì May 2012) * Editor, Journal of Labor Economics, (July 2008 ‚Äì July 2013) * Co-Editor, Economic Inquiry, (December 2007 ‚Äì January 2011) University admissions lawsuits Along with Richard D. Kahlenberg, Arcidiacono was hired by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) to serve as an expert witness in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard lawsuit, which was heard by Allison Dale Burroughs in Massachusetts federal district court in Boston in October 2018. Harvard hired Ruth Simmons and David Card as its expert witnesses. Arcidiacono and Kahlenberg also served as expert witnesses for SFFA in the Students for Fair Admissions v. UNC lawsuit, with the defendants hiring Caroline Hoxby and Bridget Terry Long. That lawsuit has yet to receive a trial date. =Amicus briefs= On June 15, 2018, many documents surrounding the Harvard litigation (including the expert reports of Arcidiacono and Card) were publicly unsealed. About six weeks later, a group of economists filed an amicus brief in support of Arcidiacono's findings in his expert witness report. The economists involved were Michael Keane, Hanming Fang, Yingyao Hu, Glenn Loury, and Matthew Shum. The brief argued that Arcidiacono's findings were correct and that Card's analysis was wrong for three reasons: # Harvard's personal rating scores are biased against Asian-Americans, and thus should not be included in the admissions model # Interactions between race and disadvantaged status should be included in the admissions model # Applicants in special recruiting categories (such as recruited athletes or legacies) should be excluded from the admissions model because they are not similarly situated to other applicants One month following, another group of economists filed an amicus brief in support of Card's analysis, claiming that the points made in the original brief were either mistaken or not germane to the question of racial discrimination. The brief also argued that Card's decision to not pool applicants across admissions cycles was correct. This group of economists consisted of Susan Dynarski, Harry J. Holzer, Hilary Hoynes, Guido Imbens, Alan B. Krueger, Helen F. Ladd, David S. Lee, Trevon D. Logan, Alexandre Mas, Michael McPherson, Jesse Rothstein, Cecilia Rouse, Robert M. Solow, Lowell J. Taylor, Sarah Turner, and Douglas Webber. An amended brief was filed shortly thereafter which added George Akerlof and Janet Yellen to the list. Controversy Arcidiacono's paper with Esteban Aucejo and Ken Spenner, entitled What happens after enrollment? An analysis of the time path of racial differences in GPA and major choice, analyzed data from Duke University and found that African American students switch out of more academically difficult majors at higher rates than their peers. However, the study found no gap in switching once adjusting for differences in academic background. Members of the Duke University Black Student Alliance protested the paper. Personal life Arcidiacono is a devout Catholic, husband, and father of five children. He has publicly discussed issues of being a Christian in academia.

Subseries These trolleybuses have 3 subseries, as shown below: =Ikarus 415T.1= The first trolleybus of this type was made in 1992 as a prototype from the Ikarus 415 bus model launched in 1985, featuring innovative technologies at the time, including microprocessor-control. The prototype was initially tested in Budapest, and it was modified in 1997, and it would later end up in Debrecen and Bratislava for trials. Finally, it ended in Tallinn where it would serve as a basis to buy the Ikarus 412T low-floor models, being retired in 2006 and eventually scrapped. The livery on this vehicle was of a purple body with a yellow trim and dark-gray underside. =Astra-Ikarus 415.80T= In 1997, RATB ordered 200 trolleybuses, seeking to replace some of the ageing DAC-series trolleybuses (from 1980-1995). An agreement with Ikarus was reached, where it would produce the bodies at their plant in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and the final assembly would be done by the Astra Railway Carriage factory in Arad, using licensed electrical equipments from GVM (Ganz Electrical Works), Ansaldo and UMEB (Uzina de Motoare Electrice Bucure»ôti/Bucharest Electrical Motor Works). The first 30 units were completed by 1997 and at the end of 2002, all 200 units were introduced. The livery applied on these vehicles is of a light blue body, with a yellow trim and dark-gray underside, similar to the one of the prototype, and on some units, the sides are painted white. They were delivered in 2 batches, as follows: *First batch (51xx, round windows) ** 5100-5129, made in 1997 ** 5130-5199, made in 1998 *Second batch (52xx, square windows) ** 5201-5205, made in 1999 ** 5206-5211, made in 2000 ** 5215-5245, made in 2001 ** 5246-5299, made in 2002 ** 5212-5214, made in 2002 (initially made in 2000, they were brought by Gala»õi, and the replacement vehicles only arrived in 2002) *Third sub-batch (5300), made in 2002.http://www.villamosok.hu/troli/ik-415-435/index.html A few interesting facts about these vehicles is that 5202 has an ICPE-SAERP-made microprocessor (on the rest of the vehicles, these were made by Ansaldo) and 5207 was presented at the Moscow Expo Centre in 2000. 5132, 5135, 5175, 5201 and 5249 were converted to driving-school vehicles, and 5135 appeared in Marilena from P7 (2006) by Cristian Nemescu. Trolleybus 5300 is no different than the ones from the second batch, it was classed differently just because of its number (note that trolleybuses numbered 5301-5400 are Irisbus Citelis-es). The lack of a trolleybus numbered 5200 is widely attributed to an urban legend that this number was reserved for the Ikarus 411T low floor prototype of the 415T which underwent testing in Bucharest around 1998-1999, which was returned to Ikarus. Currently, only 3 examples were scrapped, and were stripped of spare parts, but starting from 2017, another few examples were retired, due to the lack of parts. As of September 2018, it is believed that 10 examples were out of order. Rumors spread that the rest will be sold to Ukraine, Moldova or Russia as second-hand vehicles. The three Gala»õi Ikarus trolleybuses were initially supposed to be delivered to Bucharest with the numbers 5212-5214, but were then bought by Transurb SA to replace the older DAC trolleybuses. They were the only trolleybuses in Gala»õi from 2001 to 2008, until the arrival of MAZ-203T trolleybuses from Belarus. Their initial numbers were 223-225, but were renumbered in 2008 as 1279-1281. As of September 2018, all three are going to be retired, spending most of their time in the depot, being replaced with ≈†koda 26Tr trolleybuses. =Ikarus-Dinamo 415.83T= This variant was a prototype that was supposed to be designed for the local Russian market, in 2001. For adaptation to the Russian market, it was fitted with electrical equipment similar to the ones on the ZiU-9, being made at the Dinamo Electrical Constructions Factory from Moscow, and the bodywork was identical to the 5200-series vehicles from Bucharest. The livery was also identical to the Bucharest examples, but it used a darker blue. The trolleybus was shown at the Expo Centre in Moscow in 2001, in a similar fashion of how Ikarus presented 5207 from RATB, 2 years prior. Whilst Dinamo was hoping that the Russian transport companies would buy a modern trolleybus that had equipment similar to the familiar ZiU-9s, and that Ikarus was hoping that such orders would save the company from impending bankruptcy, in the end, no orders materialised. The reason for the lack of orders were the sudden increases in the production costs, causing the vehicle to cost twice as much as a ZiU-9 (its design dated from 1972, and its production only stopped around 2016). The prototype was in the end abandoned at the Csepel Szigethalom yard, and in 2004 it was converted into a diesel bus, still in operation by Alba Volan ZRt.
