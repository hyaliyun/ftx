His father Bertrand was the illegitimate son of Rotrou III, Count of Perche. He was a cousin of Margaret of Navarre, the queen of Sicily. He arrived in Sicily sometime around 1159 and, through Margaret's influence, was created Count of Gravina in Apulia immediately. Late in that same year, Gilbert joined a conspiracy of nobles, including Richard of Aquila, Roger of Acerra, and Bohemond of Tarsia, Count of Manoppello. The conspiracy was of only minor lords, but it gained traction. The aim of the conspirators was to assassinate Maio of Bari and in this they succeeded on 10 November 1160. The rebellion which followed was short-lived in Sicily, and Gilbert was one of the barons restored to favour, along with Bohemond. However, on the peninsula, the rebels, led by Andrew of Rupecanina, Robert of Loritello and Tancred of Lecce, marched on Butera and burned it. King William himself entered the field against Tancred, his nephew, while Gilbert held the Campania for him. Gilbert took advantage of the death of William in 1166 to pressure his cousin, the regent, into giving him a high position at court. Gilbert became the personal enemy of Margaret's chief minister, the caïd Peter, and plotted his downfall and death. Peter fled Sicily and reconverted to Islam. However, Margaret still ignored her cousin and appointed one Richard of Mandra, who had saved her late husband's life, count of Molise and chancellor. Gilbert promptly turned on him and the two met for a duel, but were separated before combat could begin. At that point, to rid Palermo of him, Margaret sent Gilbert to the peninsula as catepan of Apulia and Campania to prepare for a possible invasion of Frederick Barbarossa. The year 1166 also saw the arrival of Rodrigo, Margaret's brother and Gilbert's cousin, from Navarre. Rodrigo was sent to Apulia with the name Henry and the title Count of Montescaglioso and there he stayed briefly with Gilbert. In 1167, Barbarossa finally sent an army into the Campania. This army first established the Antipope Paschal III at Viterbo to prevent Pope Alexander III from reaching Rome. Gilbert defeated the invasive imperial forces and sent them back into Tuscany. Barbarossa himself besieged Ancona, but the appearance of Gilbert's army south along the Adriatic coast forced him to abandons the siege. Later in that year, an uncle of Gilbert's, Stephen du Perche, chancellor and Archbishop of Palermo, who had visited Gravina a year earlier, secretly sent for Gilbert's army to support him at Messina. At a council in Messina, Henry of Montescaglioso was accused by Gilbert of conspiring against the chancellor. Evidence of a confession was duly provided and the Navarrese count was imprisoned in Reggio Calabria. Gilbert, now high in favour, successfully got the count of Molise, an old adversary, arrested as well. Gilbert left with his army; but Messina was in an uproar. Messina revolted and freed the imprisoned Count Henry. The insurrection spread and the people of Palermo forced the removal of Stephen du Perche. This accomplished, an interim council was set up to assist the regent. The council exiled Gilbert and he joined Stephen on crusade, taking his wife and son, Bertrand of Andria, with him.

In this capacity, their duties are similar to those performed by the RAF Regiment and Royal Air Force Police of the United Kingdom, namely, to conduct ground combat operations as highly trained infantry troops, law enforcement and security in defense of U.S. air bases.

Built in 1932, the arena hosted circuses and boxing matches. Its seating capacity was 72,000 spectators on wood bleachers. The idea of the stadium came from boxing promotor Tex Rickard who died before it was completed. The Bowl, located at 48th Street and Northern Boulevard in Long Island City, was the site where James J. Braddock defeated Max Baer for the World Heavyweight title on June 13, 1935 -- a fight later dramatized in the film Cinderella Man. Braddock's first comeback fight against John \\"Corn\\" Griffin was also in the venue. Jack Sharkey and Primo Carnera also captured the heavyweight crown in the 1930s at the Bowl. But because no titleholder ever successfully defended his title there, the stadium was soon dubbed the \\"Jinx Bowl\\". The Madison Square Garden Bowl was torn down during World War II to make way for a US Army Mail Depot (and also because arena management deemed it more economical to rent baseball stadiums for fights). Metal from the stadium was melted down to make bullets and other war materials, including those to build the Mail Depot. The depot itself was torn down in the 1960s, and the area is now home to a Major World used-car dealership and strip mall.

It was promoted as \\"television's first ESP game\\". Art James was host, with Johnny Jacobs as announcer (though Johnny Gilbert would fill in on occasion). Created by Jack Barry, this short-lived game was the first one produced by Barry on NBC since the quiz show scandals of the 1950s, and the first of three games Barry produced at NBC (the other two were the syndicated Bullseye and NBC's Hot Potato, both under the Barry & Enright Productions brand). In 1986, Barry & Enright threatened to sue Mark Goodson Productions for copyright infringement regarding the name of a game on The Price is Right that was also called Blank Check and debuted in 1981. Rather than retiring the game, Price simply rebranded it as \\"Check Game\\", and it is still being played under that name today. Format Six players competed for an entire week of shows, trying to fill in a four-digit check. One contestant played as the \\"check writer\\" and stood behind a podium positioned stage left. That contestant hit a plunger that stopped five spinning numbers, which could be used to write the check. If the contestant spun a straight (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5) they won a bonus prize. Host James asked the other five contestants, seated in a gallery at stage right, a question requiring a response containing a common relation between two things. The contestant who rang in with the correct answer attempted to guess what number (from the five spun at the start of the game) the check writer chose as the ones digit in their check. Guessing correctly meant they switched places with the check writer and started a new check for themselves, and the check writer won the amount for which the check had been completed up to that point. If the contestant answering the question was unable to guess which number the check writer had selected, the selected number became the ones digit in the check and play continued for the tens and hundreds digits as described above. If the check writer was able to complete three digits in their check, the check writer played a game against a studio audience member. The audience member was shown four prizes and their values, and asked to pick one. The check writer had to guess the prize the audience member selected. If incorrect, the audience member won that prize, and the process repeated with the remaining prizes. If the check writer incorrectly guessed three times, the check writer lost their position and the audience member won all four prizes. If the check writer guessed correctly at any point, the game ended with the audience member winning all prizes accumulated to that point and the check writer earned the chance to place a fourth digit in their check. James then asked one last question to the gallery contestants. The correct respondent tried to guess the final digit selected by the check writer for the thousands digit in their check. If successful, the respondent became the new check writer. If the correct digit was not guessed, the number was placed in the check and the check writer won that amount in cash. Once a check writer completed a four-digit check (or if they lost the audience game), another question was asked to the remaining five contestants. The person with the correct answer then exchanged places with the former check writer. The contestant who wrote the biggest check during the week also won a car. James expressed dislike with the show's format. He and staff members sometimes referred to it as \\"Blank Mind\\" because they thought that it \\"was dumb luck, a guessing game\\". Broadcast history Blank Check debuted at 12:30 PM (11:30 AM, Central) replacing, in a scheduling shuffle with Celebrity Sweepstakes, a daytime version of Name That Tune hosted by Dennis James. At this point, the program had to end five minutes before the half-hour in order to accommodate an NBC News bulletin anchored by Edwin Newman. Check was the eleventh program to air in the 12:30/11:30 slot since that newscast began in October 1960; The Who, What, or Where Game (hosted also by James) ran the longest, from 1969 to 1974. NBC discontinued the five-minute newscast, its last daytime newscast, on December 31, 1976. The series was replaced on July 7 by The Magnificent Marble Machine at 12:00 Noon (11:00 AM, Central) in a scheduling shuffle with Geoff Edwards' ailing Jackpot! (which had overhauled its format the previous Monday); Jackpot! was canned twelve weeks later. The frequent scheduling changes of game shows reflected NBC's struggle to overcome CBS's resurgence in the field since 1972 and, increasingly, ABC's success with daytime serials such as All My Children. Theme The pilot used Quincy Jones' Chump Change, which had previously been used on Now You See It, while the actual series featured a similar-sounding song composed by Alan Thicke, called Hip Check. Hip Check would later be used as a prize cue on Wheel of Fortune.

Biography Lyman was born in Waltham, Massachusetts on August 23, 1833, son of Boston mayor Theodore Lyman II and Mary Henderson of a prominent New York family. The first Theodore, Lyman's grandfather, founded a successful shipping firm in the 1790s in York, Maine, that provided the basis for the family fortune. Theodore, Sr, sought out noted Salem architect, Samuel McIntire, to design and build his country seat, known as the Vale, in the Boston suburb of Waltham. Now known as The Lyman Estate, it is today a park and house museum owned by Historic New England. Mayor Lyman (Theodore, Jr.) served two terms and retired from public office in 1836 upon the sudden death of his wife Mary. His son Ted, as he was known by family and friends, was educated by private tutors and traveled extensively in Europe with his father. Mayor Lyman died in 1849, possibly from a stroke. Young Theodore was sixteen years old. From his father he inherited a working farm in Brookline, Massachusetts, called Singletree. His older sister Cora inherited the town house on Beacon Hill, and the two split stocks and investment income amounting to $430,000. Lyman's uncle, George Williams Lyman, took deed to the Vale. Cora's husband, Gardner Howland Shaw, guided Theodore into Harvard University where he was graduated in 1855 near the top of his class. Theodore then entered the University's Lawrence Scientific School and studied under professor Louis Agassiz, one of the preeminent natural scientists of the 19th century. He graduated with honors in 1858. Lyman was a founding member and underwriter of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Anatomy. Lyman first met future major-general George Gordon Meade in 1856 while conducting research on starfish in Florida. Lieutenant Meade was there overseeing construction of lighthouses for the Army Corps of Engineers. They became friends and corresponded frequently prior to the Civil War. Ted Lyman married Elizabeth \\"Mimi\\" Russell in 1858. Elizabeth was the daughter of George Robert Russell of Russell & Company, a successful merchant turned philanthropist. Mimi's mother was Sarah Parkman Shaw. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, commander of the famed 54th Massachusetts Infantry (portrayed in the movie \\"Glory\\"), was Mimi's first cousin. On the eve of the Civil War, Ted and Mimi embarked on a grand tour of Europe's capitals. Their first child, Cora, was born in 1862 in Florence, Italy. Lyman returned to the United States in May 1863 and joined the staff of Major General George G. Meade as an aide-de- camp with a commission as lieutenant-colonel from Governor Andrew of Massachusetts. Lyman served under Meade for the remainder of the war, from September 2, 1863, to April 20, 1865. During this time, he acted as headquarters archivist. He saw action on the battlefield when he carried flags of truce through hostile lines at Cold Harbor and Petersburg. His published letters and notebooks establish him as the preeminent recorder of events and personalities within the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac. After the war, he became a companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Loyal Legion. After the war he became a state Fish Commissioner, later a federal commissioner, and he was one of the first scientists to advocate the widespread use of fish ladders, known then as \\"fishways.\\" He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Academy of Sciences, a trustee of the Peabody Education Fund, and an overseer of Harvard University. In his role as overseer he was influential in getting his cousin Charles W. Eliot elected as President of Harvard, a position Eliot held for near forty years. Lyman was also active in the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Society of the Army of the Potomac, and the Military Historical Society of Massachusetts. Ted and Mimi's daughter Cora died in 1869 of a \\"brain fever.\\" The couple subsequently raised two boys, Theodore IV and Henry. Theodore Lyman IV attained renown as a physicist. Lyman was elected as an Independent Republican representative to the Forty-eighth Congress (March 4, 1883 – March 3, 1885) on a reform platform. The bipartisan coalition that put him into office collapsed by 1885, and he was passed over for nomination for a second term. He retired to Singletree in Brookline, where he devoted himself to the care of his sons. Through the last decade of his life, he suffered from a debilitating nervous disease. He gradually lost use of his limbs and was unable to continue work at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Despite his paralysis, he was lucid and retained a sense of humor until the end of his life. He died in Nahant, Massachusetts on September 9, 1897 and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. During his life, Theodore Lyman acquired hundreds of acres of land on Buttermilk Bay, Cape Cod, to preserve the spawning grounds of the ocean running red brook trout. His legacy and summer cottage are preserved today as the Lyman Reserve, located in Wareham, Plymouth and Bourne. The property is open to the public and managed by The Trustees of Reservations.

It was originally written to use 1/87 scale miniatures which were easily available at the time of its writing. Written by Mike Reese and Leon Tucker with contributions by Gary Gygax, the game was published by Guidon Games in 1971 and republished by TSR, Inc. in 1975. Product overview It came as a boxed set containing three booklets with illustrations by Don Lowry. It has the distinction of being the first published game to use a 20-sided die.Timeline of the Historical Miniatures Wargaming Hobby : Courier Magazine TSR printed about 5,000 copies of the game and then let it go out of print in 1977.Email from Mike Reese: The Miniatures Page The name of the game recalls the popular Avalon Hill board wargame Tactics II (1958). Although World War II style combat was popular with board wargamers, few miniature wargamers were enacting World War II battles in the mid-1960s, in part because appropriate miniatures were scarce. In 1968 Reese and Tucker, two members of the LGTSA, began play- testing rules for tank combat that would eventually form the core of Tractics. Gygax contributed some rules on infantry, covered in the second booklet, and the third booklet would cover additional topics such as airstrikes and the MODERN period (which at the time included rumors of the XM-1 tank). Gameplay The rules are for the dedicated wargaming enthusiast. The players must first acquire the miniatures and build the terrain. Reese and Tucker were interested in an accurate simulation, and as a result the game provides data describing the rate of movement, thickness of armor, and rate of fire for the makes of tank in service from 1940 to 1970. The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered World War II only. Tractics is not a perfect information game and requires the use of a judge. A player does not initially know where his enemy is located, and pieces are placed in the playing area only when they come into open view or are detected by active observation. Tanks have a base 30% chance (i.e. must roll a 15 or higher on a 20-sided die) to hit a target. Modifiers apply depending upon factors such as how well the target is concealed.

Early life William Veeder was born on September 14, 1940, in Denver, Colorado to Virginia Holderness and author William H. Veeder. He grew up in Arlington, Virginia. Education William Veeder completed his undergraduate studies at Notre Dame, and then spent two years at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, where he earned his Master of Fine Arts. Veeder received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1969, and joined the faculty at the University of Chicago that same year. Critical methodology William Veeder’s critical methodology is primarily rooted in psychoanalysis and gender theory, but he is also a strong advocate of close reading, a critical approach whereby “one gets to content through form”. He is guided by a quote from an art criticism essay written by Henry James, in which James asserted, “In the arts, feeling is always meaning.” Veeder begins his classes with this quote, usually underlining the words “always” and \\"meaning” and capitalizing the word “always.” Works Veeder has been working for over 25 years on a historical novel about Ambrose Bierce and Emma Frances Dawson, which as of 2005 was unpublished and nameless.

The attraction is based on the ancient city of Pompeii when it was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Guests board flat-bottom boats that advance through the attraction along a canal of water as if the volcano is alive once again. Special effects include swinging flickering lights, cracking wooden boards, burning walls and ceilings, and tumbling statues. At the end of the ride guests go through a misty dark room right before they go down the five story drop into the splash pool below. The ride's fire elements were installed by the same company that made the fire elements for the movie Backdraft. Ride experience Guests enter the queuing area near the back of the structure of the ride, where they pass a ruined structure with \\"Pompeii\\" written on it, with graffiti-lime \\"Escape From\\" written above the sign. Guests then walk under the final chute to the ride, where they wind past evidence of the Pompeii disaster and past billboards of an archaeological exploration of the ruins. They continue to a covered structure where boats pass the queue, and statues and columns stand crumbling in water next to the queue. Guests then are placed in rows to board the boats. After boarding flat bottom boats as if they are touring the ruins of Pompeii, guests are taken up a incline. The boat makes a small drop into the main ride building, where they pass by an abandoned archaeological site and crumbling structures as tense music begins to play. The boat passes under crumbling walls where wooden beams break apart and fall into the water to the side of the boat. The boat floats past the ruins into a room full of crumbling statues and structures standing among the water. Here, real fire begins to spread throughout the room - overhead, on top of the statues, and over the water as dramatic music begins to play. The boat continues through the fiery room, past burning columns and statues. As the boat exits the room, they pass a large statue of Jupiter, which also catches fire. The boat then passes under a crumbling wooden structure as ripples of fire burn on the ceiling. A dark room leads the boat past more crumbling structures and directly under a statue, which falls right over top of the boat, but the fall is stopped by a slightly concealed pillar to the right. The boat continues, where the music picks up dramatically, into the dark room, with fog and more ruins and statues. The boat then advances to where a door blows open and allow guests to see outside of the ride just before plunging down the 48.5-foot tall, 80-foot long chute into the water below. The boat splashes into the water (where water squirters can spritz riders) before the flume runs around a small garden with a Roman sundial (which replaced many archaeological dig-related props) and returns riders to the loading area to disembark. History Guests would wait upwards of 2 hours to ride on Pompeii, but during the first summer - the ride was often closed for 'unknown reasons' to the public. However, these reasons were in fact known and none were actually mechanical ride problems. The ride's downtime stemmed from its building fire-alarm system which during the hottest days (when combined with the heat from the fire effects) caused the sprinklers (which worked on a melting point) to turn on in the back hallways and the ride's safety system would spit the boats out of the building then shutdown the pumps for the ride. The added downtime was implemented to clean up the water in the back hallways, get the alarm company on-site to reset the sprinkler heads, and to get the ride pumps fired back up. On the evening of July 21, 2018 there was a small fire which temporarily shut down the operation of the ride. The fire started on the roof of the attraction's show building and was quickly contained and extinguished. No injuries were reported and the ride re-opened a few days later.

Carr began working on the game after watching the movie The Blue Max. It is the only game to be on the event schedule every year of the Gen Con convention since Gen Con I.\\"Only one game has been played every year at Gen Con since 1968 -- the Dawn Patrol board game, originally entitled Fight in the Skies by Mike Carr.\\" The game attracted a devoted following and it became an early Gen Con tradition to play the game on Saturday morning. Edition history Carr produced the first three editions of the game himself and distributed them among fellow members of the International Federation of Wargamers. Guidon Games published the fourth edition in 1972 and TSR, Inc. published subsequent editions, starting with the 5th edition in 1975. When TSR produced the 7th edition in 1982, they renamed the game Dawn Patrol. This edition had a print run of 20,000 copies, the largest in the history of the game. Playing the Game Players use a grid and cardboard counters to represent the locations of their planes. Since air combat is three dimensional, each player uses a log to keep track of the altitude of his plane. At the end of each turn, a player may fire on any enemy planes within his sights. A six-sided die is rolled to determine if a hit is made, and if necessary a second die is rolled to determine the amount of damage. If a player comes up behind an enemy plane, he may elect to tail the enemy. The tailed player tries to break the pursuit: each turn he secretly selects one of 16 possible maneuvers. He may for example climb, dive, turn, bank, loop, stall, barrel roll, go into a tail spin, or perform a falling leaf. The tailing player, meanwhile, is allowed to select some of the possible maneuvers for himself, the exact number depending upon his distance from the enemy. The tailed player then performs his maneuver, and if the tailing player has the maneuver in his selected list, he can duplicate the maneuver and stay on the enemy's tail. The game was frequently commended for its realism. In addition to detailed combat mechanics, Carr provides performance statistics for the 28 Allied and 30 German/Austrian aircraft in use during 1917 and 1918. The game includes historical notes and an extensive bibliography. Reception Skip Williams comments: \\"Board games featuring World War I air combat have been popular among game designers, if not game fans, for decades.

A woman wearing a visard, as engraved by Abraham de Bruyn in 1581. A woman wearing a moretta muta appears in this 1751 painting by Pietro Longhi. A visard (also spelled vizard) is an oval mask of black velvet, worn by travelling women in the 16th century to protect their skin from sunburn. It was not held to the head by a fastening, but rather the wearer would clasp a bead attached to the interior of the mask between their teeth. The fashion of the period for wealthy women was to keep their skin pale, because a tan suggested that the bearer worked outside and was hence poor. The practice did not meet universal approval, as evidenced in this excerpt from a contemporary polemic: The front of a 16th-century velvet visard. Its reverse. A visard recovered from inside the wall of a 16th-century building in Daventry, England. In Venice, the visard developed into a design without a mouth hole, the moretta, and was gripped with a button between the teeth rather than a bead. The mask's prevention of speech was deliberate, intended to heighten the mystery of a masked woman even further. In Scotland in the 1590s Anne of Denmark wore masks when horse riding. These were faced with black satin, lined with taffeta, and supplied with Florentine ribbon for fastening and for decoration.Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court', Court Historian, 24:2 (August 2019), p. 163  Citations  See also * 1550–1600 in Western European fashion  References   External links * Details of a visard in the collection of the Norwich Castle Museum * A miniature visard made for a 17th-century child's doll in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum 16th-century fashion 16th century in Europe 17th-century fashion 17th century in Europe History of clothing (Western fashion) ","title":"Visard"},{"id":"5003915","text":"Don't Give Up the Ship is a set of rules for conducting Napoleonic era naval wargames. The game was published by Guidon Games in 1972 and republished by TSR, Inc. in 1975. The game was developed as a collaboration between Dave Arneson, Gary Gygax, and Mike Carr. It was the first collaboration between Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax, the co-authors of Dungeons & Dragons. Mike Carr edited the rules and researched the historical single ship actions that are included as game scenarios. History The name comes from the dying words of James Lawrence to the crew of his USS Chesapeake, later stitched into an ensign created by Purser Samuel Hambleton and raised by Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry in the Battle of Lake Erie, during the War of 1812. In the foreword, Gygax writes about the genesis of the rules: June 1971 International Wargamer which contained Don't Give Up the Ship rules After they met for the first time at Gen Con, due to their joint interest in ship battles, they decided to collaborate on a new game, Don't Give Up the Ship! By 1971, Arneson and Gygax had produced a draft version of the game.Playing at the World blog article \\"Don't Give up the Ship in Manuscript\\" The game was published in 1971, and became another of Guidon Games's \\"Wargaming with Miniatures\\" line releases. They circulated the rules at Gen Con that year, and began serializing them in the pages of the International Wargamer. The early rules show a significant debt to Fletcher Pratt's naval wargame system, which Arneson had played heavily in the Twin Cities. Later, in the pages of the International Wargamer, Arneson would also publish a list of fighting ships of the Great Age of Sail for use in naval miniature simulations. The rules that Gygax and Arneson developed call for pencil and paper, six-sided dice, rulers and protractors, and model ships, ideally of 1:1200 scale. Single ship engagements can be played on a tabletop, but fleet battles require more space. Arneson had previously played Fletcher Pratt wargames on a classroom floor at the University of Minnesota, and the distances in Don't Give Up the Ship also exceed the dimensions of a tabletop. Wind speed and direction are determined by a roll of the dice; sail ships can only make slow progress against the wind by tacking. A protractor is used to measure the angle between the wind direction and the ship direction, and this determines ship speed. The protractor is also called into use to determine which cannons can fire on an enemy ship. Cannons can aim at the masts or at the hull, and the chance of hitting is 5 in 6 at short range (4\\") and 1 in 6 at long range (16\\"). The amount of damage from a hit is determined by the weight of the cannonball. The rules are elaborate and cover morale, sinking, fires, broken masts, and boarding. The conclusion of the book provides the statistics necessary to re- enact historical encounters such as took place between the USS Constitution and HMS Guerriere on August 19, 1812. The second edition adds 4 pages of simplified rules for battles between fleets, as well as a map for the Battle of Trafalgar. However, detailed scenario information is not included to reproduce the battle. The original Guidon Games edition of Don't Give Up the Ship also included a detachable sheet to detail the qualities of ships and track their state through the game. This served as a precedent for later character sheets in role-playing games pioneered by Arneson and Gygax.Playing at the World blog article \\"Sheets Before Characters\\" Ships of the Line Dave Arneson developed a set of naval campaign rules for the Great Age of Sail called Ships of the Line which he intended as a sequel to Don't Give Up the Ship. It collected many of the naval rules from Arneson's ongoing Napoleonic campaign, as documented in his fanzine Corner of the Table. From a September 1972 introduction written by Gary Gygax which is attached to surviving drafts, it would appear that Guidon Games originally planned to publish Ships of the Line. In 1975, TSR Hobbies added Ships of the Line to its product roadmap, and the title is listed as forthcoming in some TSR advertisements of the day, for example in Strategic Review #3. However, no published edition of Ships of the Line ever appeared. Arneson distributed some photocopies to local gamers in the Twin Cities and to remote play-by-post participants in his Napoleonic campaign. Another planned TSR title, Naval Orders of Battle, aimed to provide statistics on ships of the Great Age of Sail, compiling work which Arneson published in the International Federation of Wargaming zine the International Wargamer in 1972. It too never appeared. Legacy Mike Carr (in yellow) runs Don't Give Up the Ship at Gen Con 2013 Although Don't Give Up the Ship has been out of print for decades, it is still played and studied, due to the high profiles of the game's creators.

Its name echoed Lincoln's Inn in London, which is one of the four Inns of Court where English barristers are based. Originally, Lincoln's Inn was known as Choate Inn of the International Legal Fraternity of Phi Delta Phi but became a private club when the Harvard Faculty voted to ban all fraternities in 1907. The Inn was a student-run refuge where students meet to relax after hard weeks of study. As a student-owned club, Lincoln's Inn is beyond university regulation. The Inn had a diverse and dynamic membership that was open to all members of the HLS community. Lincoln's Inn membership was once strictly male but it now admits women, and women have been President of the Society on numerous occasions. It has become especially popular with first-year students as a way to meet their classmates. Lincoln's Inn Society merged with HL Central in 2007, following declining membership and a lack of funds.  History  The Lincoln's Inn Society was founded in 1907 by three Harvard Law School students who hoped to found a social organization to provide some relief from the stress of law school. Some of the most distinguished members of the legal profession count themselves among the society's over 3,200 alumni, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter, several U.S. Senators and Representatives, and managing partners from the nation's most prestigious law firms.  Events  The Inn is more than a gathering place. The Inn has a lively social calendar that includes some of the most exciting events at the Law School. Winter Dinner: The flagship event of the Inn is the annual Winter Dinner, a black tie/formal event held at a downtown hotel. Members meet early in the evening at the Inn for the signing of the annual poster, a tradition as old as the Inn itself. Original posters from as far back as 1918 can be found adorning the walls of the house. Tickets are free for members and guest tickets are available for purchase. Unfortunately, in 2007, due to a lack of funds, the winter dinner was not held, but members of the Society hope to reinstate it soon. Harvard/Yale Game: Harvard may not be a university known for its athletics, but the annual Harvard/Yale game is a tradition that Inn members, and most of the community, can get excited about. The Inn provides a pre-game tailgate party and, when the game is held at Yale, a bus to transport members to New Haven to cheer on the Crimson. Theme Parties: The Inn throws a number of festive themed events throughout the year. Some past highlights have included \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" the Inn's annual Halloween party; the James Bond Martini Night; numerous Hawaiian-themed events; and the annual St. Patrick's Day party. Spring Fling: In the mid 2000s, the Spring Fling offered students a chance to unwind a bit from their pre-exam stress by taking a scenic boat cruise of Boston Harbor. In some years, the Spring Fling has been a semi- formal dance as well. A poster signed by all the current members is drawn every year to commemorate that year's Christmas/Winter Dinner.  Property  The Inn itself is an historic three-story Victorian house located across the street from the Law School campus. The house's amenities, before renovation, included three fireplaces, a pool table, a foosball table and a refurbished sports bar. All members receive keys and full access to the Inn during its operating hours. In 2007, the inn was renovated to change the second floor into offices and provide a more academic feel. Lincoln's Inn is located at 44 Follen Street (). The property is owned by the society. The house is over 100 years old and has housed Lincoln's Inn for approximately 60 years.

He was the son of John and Georgia Baird Buck. He has one brother, John William Buck. His father, John, started out as a sharecropper and eventually owned over of land in Wilson, Smith, and Trousdale counties. Neither of his parents completed the eighth grade, as they dropped out of school to work in the Great Depression. His father was stricken with polio while Buck was at Lebanon High School. His father spent many months at Vanderbilt Medical Center recovering in the black lung, but never walked again. He served as a member of the House for thirty-six years. He was re-elected as a member of the Democratic Party. Buck was Vice-Chair of the House Transportation Committee and the Chair of the House Public Transportation and Highways Subcommittee. He served as Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, a member of the House Judicial Administration Subcommittee, and the House Criminal Practice and Procedure Subcommittee. Buck graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Tennessee Technological University and graduated with a J.D. from University of Tennessee Law School. He works as a farmer and as an attorney, owning a law practice with his wife, Lena Ann Graves Buck, also an attorney, called Buck & Buck Attorneys at Law near Smithville. He and Lena have 4 daughters, Kathy, Melinda, Sara and Jennifer. In 1990, Frank Buck narrowly lost to Bill Purcell in a bid for the position of House majority leader. Buck is known for efforts on ethics reform, with a long and lengthy record of supporting and passing ethics reform in his thirty-six year long legislative career. He exposed a whiskey-for-votes racket operating in DeKalb County and helped to bring reform as a member of the DeKalb County Ethics Commission. In 1994, he took issue with the expense of different execution methods reported by Department of Correction officials that placed a firing- squad execution at $7,000. He also passed legislation that resulted in the highway logo advertising seen on Tennessee highways. He was most proud of enacting the \\"Lemonade Stand Bill\\" which prevented the Tennessee Department of Health from requiring certificates of health from lemonade stands. In 1993 and 1994, Buck introduced legislation that would have restrained lobbyists from giving gifts and paying travel expenses of members of the General Assembly, and forced more disclosure of such acts. In 1994, he sponsored a bill introduced by former Sen. Carol Rice that became known as the \\"cup-of-coffee\\" bill, which would have prevented legislators from taking so much as a cup of coffee from lobbyists. A version of it was passed in 1995—without Buck as a sponsor—with a loophole that allowed legislators to receive free meals and drinks if another legislator is invited. He has received numerous awards from groups for his work on ethics reform including one from Common Cause for the Cup of Coffee bill. In February 2008, Buck announced he would not run for re- election and would retire when his current term expired.Long-time House member Buck will not run again : State and Regional News : Knoxville News Sentinel  References   External links  * Election results for the 2004 state House elections * 2008 Election results following Buck's retirement from politics 1943 births Living people Members of the Tennessee House of Representatives People from Trousdale County, Tennessee People from DeKalb County, Tennessee ","title":"Frank Buck (politician)"},{"id":"5004001","text":"Athlete squatting with four-channel, electrical muscle stimulation machine for training, attached through self-adhesive pads to her quadriceps. Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or electromyostimulation, is the elicitation of muscle contraction using electric impulses. EMS has received an increasing amount of attention in the last few years for many reasons: it can be utilized as a strength training tool for healthy subjects and athletes; it could be used as a rehabilitation and preventive tool for partially or totally immobilized patients; it could be utilized as a testing tool for evaluating the neural and/or muscular function in vivo; it could be used as a post-exercise recovery tool for athletes. The impulses are generated by a device and are delivered through electrodes on the skin near to the muscles being stimulated. The electrodes are generally pads that adhere to the skin. The impulses mimic the action potential that comes from the central nervous system, causing the muscles to contract. The use of EMS has been cited by sports scientists as a complementary technique for sports training, and published research is available on the results obtained.Examples of peer-reviewed research articles attesting increased muscular performance by utilizing EMS:  In the United States, EMS devices are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).FDA Guidance Document for Powered Muscle Stimulator, standard indications for use, page 4; contraindications, p. 7; warnings and precautions, p. 8. Product code: NGX A number of reviews have looked at the devices.  Uses  Athlete recovering with four-channel, electrical muscle stimulation machine attached through self-adhesive pads to her hamstrings Electrical muscle stimulation can be used as a training, therapeutic, or cosmetic tool. =Physical rehabilitation= In medicine, EMS is used for rehabilitation purposes, for instance in physical therapy in the prevention muscle atrophy due to inactivity or neuromuscular imbalance, which can occur for example after musculoskeletal injuries (damage to bones, joints, muscles, ligaments and tendons). This is distinct from transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), in which an electric current is used for pain therapy. In the case of TENS, the current is usually sub-threshold, meaning that a muscle contraction is not observed. During EMS training, a set of complementary muscle groups (e.g., biceps and triceps) are often targeted in alternating fashion, for specific training goals, such as improving the ability to reach for an item. For example, after neurological injuries such as spinal cord injury, electrodes may be placed on the legs and/or the gluteal muscles to target range of motion, conditioning, and/or firing of the legs (see Figure). A series of studies led by Dr. Stephen Page and colleagues showed that an electrical stimulation brace worn on the affected arms of stroke survivors could be integrated into routine occupational therapy, and significantly increase affected arm use and function, even years after the stroke occurred. =Weight loss= The FDA rejects certification of devices that claim weight reduction.FDA Import Alert 10/02/2009 Electrical Muscle Stimulators and Iontophoresis Devices Muscle stimulators are misbranded when any of the following claims are made: girth reduction, loss of inches, weight reduction, cellulite removal, bust development, body shaping and contouring, and spot reducing. EMS devices cause a calorie burning that is marginal at best: calories are burnt in significant amount only when most of the body is involved in physical exercise: several muscles, the heart and the respiratory system are all engaged at once. However, some authors imply that EMS can lead to exercise, since people toning their muscles with electrical stimulation are more likely afterwards to participate in sporting activities as the body becomes ready, fit, willing and able to take on physical activity. = Effects = \\"Strength training by NMES does promote neural and muscular adaptations that are complementary to the well-known effects of voluntary resistance training\\". This statement is part of the editorial summary of a 2010 world congress of researchers on the subject. Additional studies on practical applications, which came after that congress, pointed out important factors that make the difference between effective and ineffective EMS. This in retrospect explains why in the past some researchers and practitioners obtained results that others could not reproduce. Also, as published by reputable universities, EMS causes adaptation, i.e. training, of muscle fibers.Quoted from National Skeletal Muscle Research Center; UCSD, Muscle Physiology Home Page – Electrical Stimulation Because of the characteristics of skeletal muscle fibers, different types of fibers can be activated to differing degrees by different types of EMS, and the modifications induced depend on the pattern of EMS activity. These patterns, referred to as protocols or programs, will cause a different response from contraction of different fiber types. Some programs will improve fatigue resistance, i.e. endurance, others will increase force production.  History  Luigi Galvani (1761) provided the first scientific evidence that current can activate muscle. During the 19th and 20th centuries, researchers studied and documented the exact electrical properties that generate muscle movement. It was discovered that the body functions induced by electrical stimulation caused long-term changes in the muscles. In the 1960s, Soviet sport scientists applied EMS in the training of elite athletes, claiming 40% force gains. In the 1970s, these studies were shared during conferences with the Western sport establishments. However, results were conflicting, perhaps because the mechanisms in which EMS acted were poorly understood. Medical physiology research pinpointed the mechanisms by which electrical stimulation causes adaptation of cells of muscles, blood vessels and nerves. Society and culture = United States regulation = The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certifies and releases EMS devices into two broad categories: over-the counter devices (OTC), and prescription devices. OTC devices are marketable only for muscle toning; prescription devices can be purchased only with a medical prescription for therapy. Prescription devices should be used under supervision of an authorized practitioner, for the following uses: * Relaxation of muscle spasms; * Prevention or retardation of disuse atrophy; * Increasing local blood circulation; * Muscle re-education; * Immediate post-surgical stimulation of calf muscles to prevent venous thrombosis; * Maintaining or increasing range of motion. The FDA mandates that manuals prominently display contraindication, warnings, precautions and adverse reactions, including: no use for wearer of pacemaker; no use on vital parts, such as carotid sinus nerves, across the chest, or across the brain; caution in the use during pregnancy, menstruation, and other particular conditions that may be affected by muscle contractions; potential adverse effects include skin irritations and burns Only FDA-certified devices can be lawfully sold in the US without medical prescription. These can be found at the corresponding FDA webpage for certified devices.FDA-Certified Devices The FTC has cracked down on consumer EMS devices that made unsubstantiated claims;FTC Charges Three Top-selling Electronic Abdominal Exercise Belts with Making False Claims many have been removed from the market, some have obtained FDA certification. =Devices= Non-professional devices target home-market consumers with wearable units in which EMS circuitry is contained in belt-like garments (ab toning belts) or other clothing items. The Relax-A-Cizor was one brand of device manufactured by the U.S. company Relaxacizor, Inc. From the 1950s, the company marketed the device for use in weight loss and fitness. Electrodes from the device were attached to the skin and caused muscle contractions by way of electrical currents. The device caused 40 muscular contractions per minute in the muscles affected by the motor nerve points in the area of each pad. The directions for use recommended use of the device at least 30 minutes daily for each figure placement area, and suggested that the user might use it for longer periods if they wished. The device was offered in a number of different models which were powered either by battery or household current. Relax-A-Cizors had from 1 to 6 channels. Two pads (or electrodes) were connected by wires to each channel. The user applied from 2 to 12 pads to various parts of their body. For each channel there was a dial which purported to control the intensity of the electrical current flowing into the user's body between the two pads connected to that channel. As of 1970, the device was manufactured in Chicago, Illinois, by Eastwood Industries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Relaxacizor, Inc., and was then distributed throughout the country at the direction of Relaxacizor, Inc., or Relaxacizor Sales, Inc. The device was banned by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1970 as it was deemed to be potentially unhealthy and dangerous to the users. The case went to court, and the United States District Court for the Central District of California held that the Relax-A-Cizor was a \\"device\\" within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 321 (h) because it was intended to affect the structure and functions of the body as a girth reducer and exerciser, and upheld the FDA's assertions that the device was potentially hazardous to health. The FDA informed owners of Relax-A-Cizors that second-hand sale of Relax-A-Cizors was illegal, and recommended that they should destroy the devices or render them inoperable. Slendertone is another brand name. the company's Slendertone Flex product had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for over- the-counter sale for toning, strengthening and firming abdominal muscles. = In popular culture = In the Case Closed detective franchise, the protagonist's Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes are loosely based on EMS principles.

In 1964 the hill was named in recognition of the Chumash Indians who lived in the area due to efforts by Louisiana Dart, curator of the San Luis Obispo County Museum. Access to the peak is currently unavailable. The peak was quarried in the 1970s for foundation material in the construction of new buildings on the Cuesta College campus nearby.Cuesta.edu: History of Cuesta College . accessed 10.20.2015.

She was the youngest competitor at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, and was one of the first Canadian gymnasts to attract attention from the international gymnastics community. Although she was born in Canada, Kelsall spent a fair amount of her gymnastics career training in the United States. She trained in Oregon under coaches Dick and Linda Mulvihill, who at the time were perfecting a form of gymnastics training that incorporated video recordings and mechanical spotting equipment. She was the junior Canadian national champion in 1976, the senior National Champion in 1977 and 1980, and the British Columbian champion in 1977. She represented Canada at various international competitions from 1975 through 1980, including the 1975 Pan Am Games, where she placed thirteenth in the all-around; the 1977 American Cup, where she was the all-around bronze medalist; the 1978 World Championships and the 1978 Commonwealth Games, where she was a member of the gold medal-winning Canadian team and tied for the bronze medal in the all- around. In 1976, the thirteen-year-old Kelsall placed third at the Canadian Olympic Trials. FIG regulations at the time required gymnasts to be fourteen years old by the start of the Olympics. The Canadian Gymnastics Federation applied for, and received, a special exception for Kelsall to compete, because she would turn fourteen by the end of the year. At the Olympics, Kelsall placed a modest 27th in the all-around, but was a key member of the ninth- place Canadian team. Canada participated in the Olympic boycott of 1980, and as such, Kelsall did not have the opportunity to attend a second Olympic Games. She moved on to college, where she competed as an NCAA gymnast for the University of California, Berkeley for four years. After her undergraduate work and a brief career as a professional dancer, Kelsall returned to university. She is currently a chiropractor in the Pacific Northwest, with additional certification in massage therapy and other modalities. Kelsall originated an element on balance beam, the Kelsall Stretch. The skill is a flexibility move that is performed on the beam by standing on one foot while performing a split and grabbing the other leg from behind. Kelsall was featured in the book \\"The Making of a Gymnast: The Karen Kelsall Story\\" (1978) authored by Jean Boulogne.

It is designed to wound or kill by fragmentation. The mine is similar in appearance to the MON-50, but is approximately twice the size with a much greater depth. Design The MON-90 has an attachment point on the bottom for connecting a special clamp which can be attached to wood, metal etc. but it has no scissor type legs. It has a sight centered on the top which is flanked by two detonator cavities. The mine contains 6.2 kg of RDX (PVV-5A) to propel approximately 2000 steel rod fragments to a lethal range of 90 meters in a 54' arc (60 m wide spread at 90 m range). The MON-90 is usually command actuated using a PN manual inductor and an EDP-R electric detonator (ZT non-electric detonator also available). It can also be actuated by a variety of booby trap (BT) switches including: *MUV series pull *MVE-72 electric breakwire *VP13 seismic controller. The MON-90 is usually mounted above ground level on the surface or up in a tree to give the greatest dispersion of fragments. It is waterproof and will function effectively from temperatures of +50' to -50'C. Due to its large size the MON-90 is effective against unarmored vehicles and it may have applications as an anti-helicopter mine. It can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions.

The name \\"Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup\\" is derived from the name of the Vélodrome d'Hiver (\\"Winter Velodrome\\"), where a majority of the victims were temporarily confined. The roundup, assisted by French Police, was one of several aimed at eradicating the Jewish population in France, both in the occupied zone and in the free zone. According to records of the Préfecture de Police, 13,152 Jews were arrested, including more than 4,000 children. They were held at the Vélodrome d'Hiver in extremely crowded conditions, almost without food and water and with no sanitary facilities, as well as at the Drancy, Pithiviers, and Beaune- la-Rolande internment camps, then shipped in rail cattle cars to Auschwitz for their mass murder. French President Jacques Chirac apologized in 1995 for the complicit role that French police and civil servants played in the raid. In 2017, President Emmanuel Macron more specifically admitted the responsibility of the French State in the roundup and, hence, in the Holocaust. The Vélodrome d'Hiver The Vélodrome d'Hiver was an indoor velodrome (cycle track) at the corner of the boulevard de Grenelle and in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Eiffel Tower. It was built by Henri Desgrange, editor of L'Auto, who later organised the Tour de France, when his original track in the nearby Salle des Machines was listed for demolition in 1909 to improve the view of the Eiffel Tower. As well as track cycling, the new building was used for ice hockey, wrestling, boxing, roller-skating, circuses, spectacles and demonstrations. In the 1924 Summer Olympics, several events were held there, including foil fencing, boxing, cycling (track), weightlifting, and wrestling. Precursors The \\"Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup\\" was not the first roundup of this sort in France during World War II. In what is known as the green ticket roundup (), 3,747 Jewish men were arrested on 14 May 1941, after having received a summons in the mail (delivered on a green ticket) to 6,694 foreign Jews living in France for a status review (). The summons was a trap: those who honoured their summons were arrested and taken by bus the same day to the Gare d'Austerlitz, then shipped in four special trains to two camps at Pithiviers and Beaune-La-Rolande in the Loiret department. Women, children, and more men followed in July 1942. Planning the roundup The Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup, part of a continent-wide plan to intern and exterminate Europe's Jewish population, was a joint operation between German and French administrators. Until the German occupation of France in 1940, no roundup would have been possible because no census that listed religion had been held in France since 1874. A German ordinance on 21 September 1940, however, forced Jewish people in the occupied zone to register at police stations or (\\"sub- prefectures\\"). Nearly 150,000 registered in the department of the Seine that encompasses Paris and its immediate suburbs. Their names and addresses were kept by the French police in the fichier Tulard, a file named after its creator, André Tulard, of the Commissariat général aux questions juives (CGQJ) or Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs. This was then headed by Xavier Vallat, and housed at in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, in the building of the former Banque Léopold Louis Dreyfus. Theodor Dannecker, the SS captain who headed the German police in France, said: \\"This filing system subdivided into files sorted alphabetically; Jews with French nationality and foreign Jews had files of different colors, and the files were also sorted, according to profession, nationality and street.\\" These files were then handed to the Gestapo, in charge of the \\"Jewish problem.\\" What became known as the \\"Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup\\" was to be larger than the green ticket roundup which had taken place a year earlier. To plan it, René Bousquet, secretary-general of the national police, and Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, who had replaced Xavier Vallat in May 1942 as head of the CGQJ, travelled on 4 July 1942 to Gestapo headquarters at 93 rue Lauriston in the (Paris, 16th arr) to meet Dannecker and Helmut Knochen of the SS. A further meeting took place in Dannecker's office on the avenue Foch on 7 July. Also present were Jean Leguay, Bousquet's deputy, Jean François, who was director of the general police, , head of Paris police, André Tulard, and others from the French police. Dannecker met Adolf Eichmann on 10 July 1942, and another meeting took place the same day at the General Commission for Jewish Affairs (CGQJ) attended by Dannecker, Heinz Röthke, Ernst Heinrichsohn, Jean Leguay, Gallien, deputy to Darquier de Pellepoix, several police officials and representatives of the French railway service, the SNCF. The roundup was delayed because the French asked to avoid holding it a couple of days before Bastille Day on 14 July. The national holiday was not celebrated in the occupied zone, and there was a wish to avoid the risk of civil uprisings. Dannecker declared: \\"The French police, despite a few considerations of pure form, have only to carry out orders!\\"CDJC-CCCLXIV 2. Document produced in court Oberg-Knochen in September 1954, cited by Maurice Rajsfus in La Police de Vichy – Les forces de l'ordre au service de la Gestapo, 1940/1944, Le Cherche Midi, 1995, p. 118 The roundup was aimed at Jews from Germany, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and the apatrides (\\"stateless\\"), whose origin couldn't be determined, aged from 16 to 50. There were to be exceptions for women \\"in advanced state of pregnancy\\" or who were breast-feeding, but \\"to save time, the sorting will be made not at home but at the first assembly centre\\". The Germans planned for the French police to arrest 22,000 Jews in Greater Paris. They would then be taken to internment camps at Drancy, Compiègne, Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande. André Tulard \\"will obtain from the head of the municipal police the files of Jews to be arrested.... Children of less than 15 or 16 years will be sent to the Union générale des israélites de France (UGIF, General Union of French Jews), which will place them in foundations. The sorting of children will be done in the first assembly centres.\\" Police complicity Star of David badge in June 1942, a few weeks before the mass arrest The position of the French police was complicated by the sovereignty of the Vichy government, which nominally administered France while accepting occupation of the north. Although in practice the Germans ran the north and had a strong and later total domination in the south, the formal position was that France and the Germans were separate. The position of Vichy and its leader, Philippe Pétain, was recognised throughout the war by many foreign governments. The independence, however fictional, had to be preserved. German interference in internal policing, says the historian Julian T. Jackson, \\"would further erode that sovereignty which Vichy was so committed to preserving. This could only be avoided by reassuring Germany that the French would carry out the necessary measures.\\" Jackson adds that the decision to arrest Jews and Communists and Gaullists was \\"an autonomous policy, with its own indigenous roots.\\" In other words the decision to do so was not forced on the Vichy regime by the Germans. Jackson also explains that the roundup of Jews must have been driven by the French since the Germans would not have had the necessary information or the manpower to find and arrest a full 13,000. On 2 July 1942, René Bousquet attended a planning meeting in which he raised no objection to the arrests and worried only about the (\\"embarrassing\\") fact that the French police would carry them out. Bousquet succeeded in a compromise that the police would round up only foreign Jews. Vichy ratified that agreement the following day. Although the police have been blamed for rounding up children of less than 16—the age was set to preserve a fiction that workers were needed in the east—the order was given by Pétain's minister, Pierre Laval, supposedly as a \\"humanitarian\\" measure to keep families together. This too was a fiction given that the parents of these children had already been deported; documents of the period have revealed that the anti-Semitic Laval's principal concern was what to do with Jewish children once their parents had been deported. The youngest child sent to Auschwitz under Laval's orders was 18 months old. Three former SS officers testified in 1980 that Vichy officials had been enthusiastic about deportation of Jews from France. The investigator Serge Klarsfeld found minutes in German archives of meetings with senior Vichy officials and Bousquet's proposal that the roundup should cover non-French Jews throughout the country. In 1990, charges of crimes against humanity were laid against Bousquet in relation to his role in the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup of Jews based on complaints filed by Klarsfield. The historians Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper record: > Klarsfeld also revealed the telegrams Bousquet had sent to Prefects of > départements in the occupied zone, ordering them to deport not only Jewish > adults but children whose deportation had not even been requested by the > Nazis. The roundup , director of the city police, ordered on 12 July 1942 that \\"the operations must be effected with the maximum speed, without pointless speaking and without comment.\\" Beginning at 4:00 a.m. on 16 July 1942, 13,152 Jews were arrested. According to records of the Préfecture de police, 5,802 (44%) of these were women and 4,051 (31%) were children. An unknown number of people, warned by the French Resistance, hidden by neighbors or benefiting from the lack of zeal or thoroughness of some policemen, escaped being rounded up. Conditions for the arrested were harsh: they could take only a blanket, a sweater, a pair of shoes and two shirts with them. Most families were split up and never reunited.For more information on a reliable and well known case of deportation, see the article on Bereck Kofman, father of the famous French philosopher Sarah Kofman. After arrest, some Jews were taken by bus to an internment camp in an unfinished complex of apartments and apartment towers in the northern suburb of Drancy. Others were taken to the Vélodrome d'Hiver in the 15th arrondissement, which had already been used as a prison in a roundup in the summer of 1941. The Vel' d'Hiv' The Vel' d'Hiv' was available for hire to whoever wanted it. Among those who had booked it was Jacques Doriot, who led France's largest fascist party, the Parti Populaire Français. It was at the Vel' d'Hiv' among other venues that Doriot, with his Hitler-like salute, roused crowds to join his cause. Among those who helped in the Rafle du Vel' d'hiv' were 3,400 young members of Doriot's PPF. The Germans demanded the keys of the Vel' d'Hiv' from its owner, Jacques Goddet, who had taken over from his father Victor and from Henri Desgrange. The circumstances in which Goddet surrendered the keys remain a mystery and the episode is given only a few lines in his autobiography. The Vel' d'Hiv' had a glass roof, which had been painted dark blue to avoid attracting bomber navigators. The glass raised the heat when combined with windows screwed shut for security. The numbers held there vary according to accounts but one established figure is 7,500 of a final figure of 13,152.Le Figaro, 22 July 2002 They had no lavatories: of the 10 available, five were sealed because their windows offered a way out and the others were blocked.\\"The track that died of shame\\", Procycling, UK, 2002 The arrested Jews were kept there with only water and food brought by Quakers, the Red Cross and a few doctors and nurses allowed to enter. There was only one water tap. Those who tried to escape were shot on the spot. Some took their own lives. After five days, the prisoners were taken to the internment camps of Drancy, Beaune-la-Rolande and Pithiviers, and later to extermination camps. After the roundup Roundups were conducted in both the northern and southern zones of France, but public outrage was greatest in Paris because of the numbers involved in a concentrated area. The Vel' d'Hiv' was a landmark in the city centre. The Roman Catholic church was among the protesters. Public reaction obliged Laval to ask the Germans on 2 September not to demand more Jews. Handing them over, he said, was not like buying items in a discount store. Laval managed to limit deportations mainly to foreign Jews; he and his defenders argued after the war that allowing the French police to conduct the roundup had been a bargain to ensure the life of Jews of French nationality. In reality, \\"Vichy shed no tears over the fate of the foreign Jews in France, who were seen as a nuisance, ' (\\"dregs\\")' in Laval's words. Laval told an American diplomat that he was \\"happy\\" to get rid of them., Tallandier, 2006. When a Protestant leader accused Laval of murdering Jews, Laval insisted they had been sent to build an agricultural colony in the East. \\"I talked to him about murder, he answered me with gardening.\\" Drancy camp and deportation The deportation route from Paris to Auschwitz The internment camp at Drancy was easily defended because it was built of tower blocks in the shape of a horseshoe. It was guarded by French gendarmes. The camp's operation was under the Gestapo's section of Jewish affairs. Theodor Dannecker, a key figure both in the roundup and in the operation of Drancy, was described by Maurice Rajsfus in his history of the camp as \\"a violent psychopath.... It was he who ordered the internees to starve, who banned them from moving about within the camp, to smoke, to play cards, etc.\\" In December 1941, forty prisoners from Drancy were murdered in retaliation for a French attack on German police officers. Immediate control of the camp was under Heinz Röthke. It was under his direction from August 1942 to June 1943 that almost two thirds of those deported in SNCF box car transports requisitioned by the Nazis from Drancy were sent to Auschwitz. Drancy is also the location where Klaus Barbie transported Jewish children that he captured in a raid of a children's home before shipping them to Auschwitz where they were killed. Most of the initial victims, including those of the Vel' d'Hiv', were crammed in sealed wagons and died due to lack of food and water. Those who survived the passage died in the gas chambers. At the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, the camp was run by the Resistance—\\"to the frustration of the authorities; the Prefect of Police had no control at all and visitors were not welcome\\"—who used it to house not Jews but those it considered had collaborated with the Germans. When a pastor was allowed in on 15 September, he discovered cells 3.5m by 1.75m that had held six Jewish internees with two mattresses between them. The prison returned to the conventional prison service on 20 September. Aftermath Pierre Laval with the head of German police units in France, Carl Oberg The roundup accounted for more than a quarter of the Jews sent from France to Auschwitz in 1942, of whom only 811 returned to France at the end of the war. With the exception of six adolescents, none of the 3,900 children detained at the Vel d’Hiv and then deported survived. Pierre Laval's trial opened on 3 October 1945. His first defence was that he had been obliged to sacrifice foreign Jews to save the French. Uproar broke out in the court, with supposedly neutral jurors shouting abuse at Laval, threatening \\"a dozen bullets in his hide\\". It was, said the historians Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper, \\"a cross between an and a tribunal during the Paris Terror\\". From 6 October, Laval refused to take part in the proceedings, hoping that the jurors' interventions would lead to a new trial. Laval was sentenced to death, and tried to commit suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule. Revived by doctors, he was executed by firing squad at Fresnes Prison on 15 October. Jean Leguay survived the war and its aftermath and became president of Warner Lambert, Inc. from London (now merged with Pfizer), and later president of Substantia Laboratories in Paris. In 1979, he was charged for his role in the roundup. Louis Darquier was sentenced to death in 1947 for collaboration. However, he had fled to Spain, where the Francisco Franco regime protected him. In 1978, after he gave an interview stating the gas chambers of Auschwitz were used to kill lice, the French government requested his extradition. This request was refused by Spain.English translation of the 1978 interview in L'Express, accessed online, 7 August 2009. He died on 29 August 1980, near Málaga, Spain. Helmut Knochen was sentenced to death by a British Military Tribunal in 1946 for the murder of British pilots. The sentence was never carried out. He was extradited to France in 1954 and again sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. In 1962, the president, Charles de Gaulle, pardoned him and he was sent back to Germany, where he retired to Baden-Baden and died in 2003. Émile Hennequin, head of Paris police, was condemned to eight years' penal labour in June 1947. 23 January 1943: German-Vichy French meeting in Marseille. SS-Sturmbannführer Bernhard Griese, Marcel Lemoine (regional préfet), , (Commander of Marseille's Sicherheitspolizei), -laughing- René Bousquet (General Secretary of the French National Police created in 1941) creator of the GMRs, -behind- Louis Darquier de Pellepoix (Commissioner for Jewish Affairs). René Bousquet was last to be tried, in 1949. He was acquitted of \\"compromising the interests of the national defence\\", but declared guilty of for involvement in the Vichy government. He was given five years of Dégradation nationale, a measure immediately lifted for \\"having actively and sustainably participated in the resistance against the occupier\\". Bousquet's position was always ambiguous; there were times he worked with the Germans and others when he worked against them. After the war he worked at the Banque d'Indochine and in newspapers. In 1957, the Conseil d'État gave back his Légion d'honneur, and he was given an amnesty on 17 January 1958, after which he stood for election that same year as a candidate for the Marne. He was supported by the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance; his second was Hector Bouilly, a radical-socialist general councillor. In 1974, Bousquet helped finance François Mitterrand's presidential campaign against Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. In 1986, as accusations cast on Bousquet grew more credible, particularly after he was named by Louis Darquier,Intervies, L'Express, 1978 he and Mitterrand stopped seeing each other. The parquet général de Paris closed the case by sending it to a court that no longer existed. Lawyers for the International Federation of Human Rights spoke of a \\"political decision at the highest levels to prevent the Bousquet affair from developing\\". In 1989, Serge Klarsfeld and his , the and the filed a complaint against Bousquet for Crime against humanity for the deportation of 194 children. Bousquet was committed to trial but on 8 June 1993 a 55-year-old mental patient named Christian Didier entered his flat and shot him dead. Theodor Dannecker was interned by the United States Army in December 1945 and a few days later committed suicide. Jacques Doriot, whose French right-wing followers helped in the round-up, fled to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany and became a member of the exile Vichy government there. He died in February 1945 when his car was strafed by Allied fighters while he was travelling from Mainau to Sigmaringen. He was buried in Mengen.  Action against the police  A French gendarme guarding Jews held at the Drancy internment camp After the Liberation, survivors of the internment camp at Drancy began legal proceedings against gendarmes accused of being accomplices of the Nazis. An investigation began into 15 gendarmes, of whom 10 were accused at the Cour de justice de la Seine of conduct threatening the safety of the state. Three fled before the trial could start. The other seven said they were only obeying orders, despite numerous witnesses and accounts by survivors of brutality. The court ruled on 22 March 1947 that the seven were guilty but that most had rehabilitated themselves \\"by active participation, useful and sustained, offered to the Resistance against the enemy.\\" Two others were jailed for two years and condemned to dégradation nationale for five years. A year later they were reprieved.  Government admission  For decades the French government declined to apologize for the role of French policemen in the roundup or for any other state complicity. It was argued (by de Gaulle and others) that the French Republic had been dismantled when Philippe Pétain instituted a new French State during the war and that the Republic had been re-established when the war was over. It was not for the Republic, therefore, to apologise for events caused by a state which France did not recognise. President François Mitterrand reiterated this position in a September 1994 speech. \\"I will not apologize in the name of France. The Republic had nothing to do with this. I do not believe France is responsible.\\" On 16 July 1995, the next President, Jacques Chirac, reversed that position, stating that it was time that France faced up to its past. He acknowledged the role that \\"the French State\\" played in the persecution of Jews and others during the War. > Il est difficile de les évoquer, aussi, parce que ces heures noires > souillent à jamais notre histoire, et sont une injure à notre passé et à nos > traditions.

The president recognized that this event was a crime committed \\"in France, by France,\\" and emphasized that the deportations in which French police participated were offences committed against French values, principles, and ideals. The earlier claim that the Government of France during World War II was some illegitimate group was again advanced by Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front Party, during the 2017 election campaign. In speeches, she claimed that the Vichy government was \\"not France\\". On 16 July 2017, also in commemoration of the victims of the roundup, President Emmanuel Macron denounced his country's role in the Holocaust and the historical revisionism that denied France's responsibility for 1942 roundup and subsequent deportation of 13,000 Jews. \\"It was indeed France that organised this [roundup]\\", he said, French police collaborating with the Nazis. \\"Not a single German took part,\\" he added. Chirac had already stated that the Government during the War represented the French State. Macron was even more specific in this respect: \\"It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it's convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.\\" Macron made a subtle reference to Chirac's 1995 apology when he added, \\"I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.\\" Memorials and monuments =Paris= Commemorative plaque to the victims held in the Vel' d'Hiv after the 16–17 July 1942 roundup of Jews in Paris. A fire destroyed part of the Vélodrome d'Hiver in 1959 and the rest of the structure was demolished. A block of flats and a building belonging to the Ministry of the Interior now stand on the site. A plaque marking the Vel' d'Hiv' Roundup was placed on the track building after the War and moved to 8 boulevard de Grenelle in 1959. On 3 February 1993, President François Mitterrand commissioned a monument to be erected on the site.Presidential decree, 3 February 1993 It stands now on a curved base, to represent the cycle track, on the edge of the quai de Grenelle. It is the work of the Polish sculptor Walter Spitzer and the architect Mario Azagury. Spitzer's family were survivors of deportation to Auschwitz. The statue represents all deportees but especially those of the Vel' d'Hiv'. The sculptures include children, a pregnant woman and a sick man. The words on the Mitterrand-era monument still differentiate between the French Republic and the Vichy Government that ruled during WW II, so they do not accept State responsibility for the roundup of the Jews. The words are in French: \\"\\", which translate as follows: \\"The French Republic pays homage to the victims of racist and anti-Semitic persecutions and crimes against humanity committed under the de facto authority called the 'Government of the French State' 1940–1944. Let us never forget.\\" The monument was inaugurated on 17 July 1994. A commemorative ceremony is held here every year in July. A memorial plaque in memory of victims of the Vel' d'Hiv' raid was placed at the Bir-Hakeim station of the Paris Métro on 20 July 2008. The ceremony was led by Jean-Marie Bockel, Secretary of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and was attended by Simone Veil, a deportee and former minister, anti-Nazi activist Beate Klarsfeld, and numerous dignitaries. =Drancy= A railway wagon used to carry internees to Auschwitz and now displayed at Drancy A memorial was also constructed in 1976 at Drancy internment camp, after a design competition won by Shelomo Selinger. It stands beside a rail wagon of the sort used to take prisoners to the death camps. It is three blocks forming the Hebrew letter Shin, traditionally written on the Mezuzah at the door of houses occupied by Jews. Two other blocks represent the gates of death. Shelomo Selinger said of his work: \\"The central block is composed of 10 figures, the number needed for collective prayer (Minyan). The two Hebrew letters Lamed and Vav are formed by the hair, the arm and the beard of two people at the top of the sculpture. These letters have the numeric 36, the number of RighteousSee Righteous among the nations thanks to whom the world exists according to Jewish tradition.\\" On 25 May 2001, the cité de la Muette—formal name of the Drancy apartment blocks—was declared a national monument by the culture minister, Catherine Tasca. A new Shoah memorial museum was opened in 2012 just opposite the sculpture memorial and railway wagon by President François Hollande. It provides details of the persecution of the Jews in France and many personal mementos of inmates before their deportation to Auschwitz and their death. They include messages written on the walls, graffiti, drinking mugs and other personal belongings left by the prisoners, some of which are inscribed with the names of the owners. The ground floor also shows a changing exhibit of prisoner faces and names, as a memorial to their imprisonment and then murder by the Germans, assisted by the French gendarmerie. The Holocaust researcher Serge Klarsfeld said in 2004: \\"Drancy is the best known place for everyone of the memory of the Shoah in France; in the crypt of Yad Vashem (Jérusalem), where stones are engraved with the names of the most notorious Jewish concentration and extermination camps, Drancy is the only place of memory in France to feature.\\"Le camp de Drancy et ses gares de déportation: Bourget- Drancy et Bobigny, 20 août 1941 – 20 août 1944, FFDJF, January 2004.

It was created in the early 1970s and became prominent throughout Texas and Southern California. It was started to combat growing inequality and dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party that was typically supported by Mexican-American voters.Ignacio M. Garcia, United we win: The rise and fall of La Raza Unida Party (University of Arizona Press, 1989). After its establishment in Texas, the party launched electoral campaigns in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and California, though it only secured official party status for statewide races in Texas. It did poorly in the 1978 Texas elections and leaders and members dropped away. La Raza, as it was usually known, experienced most of its success at the local level in Southwest Texas, most notably when the party swept city council, school board, and mayoralty elections in Crystal City, Cotulla, and Carrizo Springs. Much of the success was attributed to the aggressive grassroots organizing that was concentrated in cities that had the lowest income and education levels.  MAYO and the birth of La Raza Unida Party  The Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) was begun by five young men studying at St. Mary's University in 1967: Jose Angel Gutierrez, Mario Compean, William Velasquez, Ignacio Perez, and Juan Patlan. Jose Angel explained \\"All of us were the products of the traditional Mexican American organizations … All of us were very frustrated at the lack of political efficacy, at the lack of any broad based movement, and at the lack of expertise\\".Armando Navarro (2000) La Raza Unida Party, p. 20 Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement and by leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and black nationalists like Malcolm X, they reached the conclusion that the actions being taken by the leaders of the Chicano Movement were not doing enough to get results. They decided that they would halt the current approach being utilized by groups like LULAC and the American G. I. Forum, \\"which by the 1960s relied on litigation and support from sympathetic Anglos to achieve their goals\\". The five men decided that their new tactics would be much more confrontational, utilizing civil disobedience tactics used in the Civil Rights Movement. They decided to incorporate Saul Alinsky's model of confrontation politics: \\"And we said that was going to be the strategy[…] use confrontational politics based on information[…] well researched, but also foregoing the use of nice language\\". MAYO became dedicated to creating meaningful social change by relying on abrasing, confrontational (but nonviolent) measures. They protested, picketed, and spread their message through newspapers like El Deguello, El Azteca,and La Revolucion. Their tactics earned them criticisms both white and Mexican American political figures who felt that they were being too abrasive in their tactics. Jose Angel became targeted especially after comments he made where he called to \\"eliminate the gringo\\". While he elaborated to say that by gringo he meant \\"a person or institution that has a certain policy or program, or attitudes that reflect bigotry, racism, discord, prejudice, and violence\\", the damage was done. Despite attacks on all sides, MAYO continued to organize protests and boycotts, which is what ultimately led them to Crystal City. The La Raza Unida Party started with simultaneous efforts throughout the U.S. Southwest. The most widely known and accepted story is that the La Raza Unida Party was established on January 17, 1970 at a meeting of some three hundred Mexican- Americans in Crystal City, Texas by José Ángel Gutiérrez and Mario Compean, who had also helped in the foundation of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) in 1967. In Lubbock, the youth organization was headed by the journalist Bidal Aguero, who later worked in the Raza Unida Party. The party originated from a group called WOW, or Workmen of the World. Its original thirteen members included Alfredo Zamora, Jr., the first Chicano mayor of Cotulla, Texas, who unseated a member of the Cotulla family. A second Hispanic mayor followed, Arcenio A. Garcia, who was twenty-four at the time of his election, the youngest mayor then in Texas. Zamora left LaSalle County within two years and the next election in 1972 was won by Garcia under the Raza Unida party. Previously in December 1969, at the only national MAYO meeting, Chicano activists decided on the formation of that third party Raza Unida. This new party would focus on improving the economic, social and political aspects of the Chicano community throughout Texas. This party resulted in the election of the first 2 Mexican American Mayors in LaSalle County. Following the victory of the RUP in municipal elections in Crystal City and Cotulla, the party grew and expanded to other states, especially California and Colorado. In Colorado the RUP worked closely with Rodolfo \\"Corky\\" Gonzales and the Crusade For Justice based out of Denver. In California, the RUP spread throughout the state and held strong ground in the County of Los Angeles at one point with as many as 20 different chapters. The novice city council was not very effective in implementing its goals and damaged the party's reputation in the short-term. The RUP, however, ran candidates for governor of Texas, Ramsey Muniz in 1972 and 1974 and Mario Compean of San Antonio in 1978. They petitioned the conservative Dr. Hector P. Garcia to run on the RUP ticket, but he declined. In 1972, they ran a candidate, Secundion Salazar, in a competitive U. S. Senate race in Colorado. Salazar received 1.4 percent of the vote, as victory went to the Democrat Floyd Haskell. During the late 1970s the La Raza Unida Party decided to change tactics from a \\"get out the vote\\" organization to a more community based, grassroots, revolutionary nationalist format seeking the unity of all Chicanos, other Latinos, and Native Americans in the American Southwest, commonly called Aztlán. Xenaro Ayala was voted in as the national party chairman in 1978. The party held a second national convention in which Juan Jose Pena was elected chairman in 1980. However, the party was effectively eliminated from electoral politics after Compean's weak showing in 1978. A reunion conference commemorating the 40th anniversary of the party was held from July 6 to 7, 2012, in the capital city of Austin. According to an organizer, the aging former members of the party wanted to get together for \\"el ultimo adios,\\" or \\"one final goodbye\\". Attendees included José Ángel Gutiérrez and Mario Compean.  1972 Texas elections  After initial successes where Chicanos were elected in the South Texas counties of Dimmit, La Salle, and Zavala, La Raza Unida Party decided to be more ambitious for the 1972 gubernatorial elections. The campaign run by La Raza Unida for the 1972 was extremely controversial because it was entirely racially based. The leaders of the party believed that change could only occur by \` shared by Mexican Americans. They also asserted that racism against Mexican Americans was so prolific that the entire political system would have to be reevaluated. Mario Compean, past spokesperson for La Raza Unida, said \\"Ours was a message of liberation from […] a corrupt political system anchored on the twin pillars of racism and discrimination, on the one hand, and social subordination imposed by capitalism on the other\\". The candidate endorsed by La Raza Unida was an ex-Baylor football-player-turned-lawyer named Ramsey Muñiz. He was, at the time, a political unknown, who had been involved with MAYO since 1968 but not distinguished himself. Muñiz ran an aggressive campaign, \\"everywhere he went he hammered away at both parties, although the Democrats, who controlled the state legislature and the governor's mansion, received the brunt of the criticism\\". In a speech at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, he said, > Ya basta. Raza Unida offers the people an alternative and the days of being > led to the polls to vote straight ticket for these two other parties are > over… if it is not done this year, it will come next year or the next… as > long as there are Mexican Americans there will be persons to replace people > like me\\" Muñiz ran on a campaign devoted to improving education in Texas, developing multilingual and multicultural curriculums, equal funding for all school districts, for local school boards to proportionately reflect their communities, free early childhood education, and a number of other services. Despite his immense popularity and recognition in the state as one of the leading Mexican-American political figures, his fellow LRUP candidates fell short in attaining the same level of popularity. Despite obstacles, Muñiz campaigned tirelessly both in the state and outside – targeting areas with high numbers of migrant workers from Texas. Similar to campaigns run previously in Crystal City, La Raza Unida distributed massive amounts of buttons, stickers, and posters along with holding huge vote drives on election day in the barrios. Ramsay Muñiz lost his bid for governor in the 1972 elections. He obtained 6.28 percent of the vote, Dolph Briscoe – the Democratic candidate – received 47.8 percent of the vote, and Republican Henry Grover received 45.08 percent. An estimated 18 percent of Mexican Americans who voted in the 1972 election voted for Ramsay Muñiz. He received very high voting rates in rural cities and counties with lower incomes[xiv]. He received 51 percent of the vote in Brooks County and 46 percent in Jim Hogg County. In the 15 Mexican American counties, he received 30,020 votes compared to Grover's 31,641, and the winning Democrat, Dolph Briscoe. who polled 60,697 votes. While they lost the gubernatorial election, La Raza Unida Party won fifteen local positions in several borderland counties: La Salle, Dimmit, Zavala, and Hidalgo. Despite this success in the 1972 election, it could not be replicated at the state level again. However, several counties in South Texas continued to see candidates elected by La Raza Unida for years after the 1972 election, until 1978, when the party broke apart. Women played a growing role in the party in Texas in the 1970s, holding party offices at various levels and running as political candidates, as well as doing campaign work in many localities.Dionne Espinoza, \\"'The Partido Belongs to Those Who Will Work for It': Chicana Organizing and Leadership in the Texas Raza Unida Party, 1970-1980,\\" Aztlan (2011) 36#1 pp 191-210. Political scientists have examined the 1972 gubernatorial race when La Raza Unida Party called for ethnic solidarity. There was deep alienation among Mexican Americans from Anglo- dominated politics. However, Mexican American support for LRUP was uneven across Texas and reflected differing levels of economic attainment and incorporation.Benjamin Marquez, and Rodolfo Espino, \\"Mexican American support for third parties: the case of La Raza Unida,\\" Ethnic & Racial Studies (2010) 33#2 pp 290-312Efrén O. Pérez, \\"Xenophobic Rhetoric and Its Political Effects on Immigrants and Their Co‐Ethnics.\\" American Journal of Political Science 59.3 (2015): 549-564.  Crystal City indictments  In 1976, eleven officials in Crystal City, Texas, were indicted on various counts. Angel Noe Gonzalez, the former Crystal City Independent School District superintendent who later worked in the United States Department of Education in Washington, D.C., upon his indictment retained the San Antonio lawyer and later mayor, Phil Hardberger. Gonzalez was charged with paying Adan Cantu for doing no work. Hardberger, however, documented to the court specific duties that Cantu had performed and disputed all the witnesses called against Cantu. The jury acquitted Gonzalez. Many newspapers reported on the indictments but not on the acquittal. John Luke Hill, the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, had sought to weaken RUP so that he would not lose general election votes to a third party candidate. Victory, however, went not to Hill but narrowly to his Republican rival, Bill Clements. Compean received only 15,000 votes, or 0.6 percent, just under Clements's 17,000-vote plurality over Hill.Rick Casey, \\"Not first time La Raza Unida has been blamed\\", San Antonio Express-News, February 13, 2016, p.

The first Altair, converted from a Sirius, flew in September 1930.Francillon 1982, p. 101. Like the Sirius, the Altair was a single-engined, low-winged monoplane of wooden construction. The undercarriage, which was operated by use of a hand crank, retracted inwards. Four Altairs following the prototype were converted Sirii, with another six Altairs built from scratch: three by Lockheed, two by the Detroit Aircraft Corporation, and one by AiRover. The AiRover Altair, dubbed The Flying Testbed, was powered by a Menasco Unitwin engine, which used two engines to drive a single shaft. The Unitwin was used in the Vega Starliner, which never went into production. Operational history The prototype Altair was purchased by the United States Army Air Corps and designated Y1C-25, with a second Altair, fitted with a metal construction fuselage was also purchased by the Army as the Y1C-23 and used as a staff transport, as was a single similar aircraft operated by the US Navy as the XRO-1.Francillon 1978, pp. 101–106.

Significance  According to the Jain texts, the sangha will be maintained till the very end of the present strife-ridden spoke of time (pancham kaal). With the end of the sangha, the dharma (religion) will also end.  Other Uses  The word sangha has been used to refer to various lineages in the Digambara sect of Jainism.

Swallowing is typically performed normally, so it is not a true case of dysphagia, but it can become quite irritating. It is common, with 22–45% of people experiencing it at least once in their lifetime. Causes The \\"lump in the throat\\" sensation that characterizes globus pharyngis is often caused by inflammation of one or more parts of the throat, such as the larynx or hypopharynx, due to cricopharyngeal spasm, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), laryngopharyngeal reflux or esophageal versatility. In some cases the cause is unknown and symptoms may be attributed to a psychogenic cause i.e. a somatoform or anxiety disorder. It has been recognised as a symptom of depression, which responds to anti-depressive treatment. The results of recent studies have strongly suggested that GERD is a major cause of globus, though this remains under considerable debate. A less common cause, distinguished by a \\"lump in the throat\\" accompanied with clicking sensation and considerable pain when swallowing, may be due to thyroid-cartilage rubbing against anomalous asymmetrical laryngeal anatomy e.g. the superior cornu abrading against the thyroid lamina, surgically trimming the offending thyroid- cartilage provides immediate relief in all cases. However this cause is frequently misdiagnosed, despite requiring a simple clinical examination involving careful palpation of the neck side to side which elicits the same click sensation (laryngeal crepitus) and pain as when swallowing, most cases are due to prior trauma to the neck. High resolution computed tomographic (CT) or MRI scan of the larynx is usually required to fully understand the anomalous laryngeal anatomy. Anterior displacement of the thyroid ala on the affected side while swallowing can help resolve symptoms. Diagnosis As globus sensation is a symptom, a diagnosis of globus pharyngis is typically a diagnosis of exclusion. If globus sensation is presenting with other symptoms such as pain, swallowing disorders such as aspiration or regurgitation (dysphagia), weight loss, or voice change, an organic cause needs to be investigated, typically with endoscopy. Barium swallows are not recommended as a diagnostic tool as although they are less invasive than endoscopy and may be reassuring to the patient, they commonly miss sinister causes. It is very rare that globus sensation presenting with no other symptoms has a sinister cause and therefore endoscopy is not recommended in this case. =Differential diagnosis= Differential diagnosis must be made from Eagle syndrome which uses the patient's description of \\"something caught in my throat\\" as a diagnostic tool. Eagle syndrome is an elongation of the styloid process causing irritation to nerves and muscles in the region resulting in a number of unusual symptoms. Management Reassurance of the patient is recommendable when no cause can be found. If a cause is identified, treat the cause symptomatically or, if possible, systemically.

By the 1970s–80s it had become extinct, with recent reports in Mayanist literature finding that there are no living native speakers.See Campbell and Canger (1978); Ethnologue entry on \\"Chicomuceltec\\" (Gordon 2005). Communities of contemporary Chicomucelteco descendants, numbering approximately 1500 persons in Mexico and 100 in GuatemalaSee Gordon (2005) for population estimates, which draw on sources collected in the early 1980s. are Spanish speakers. Chicomuceltec was formerly sometimes called Cakchiquel Mam, although it is only distantly related to the Cakchiquel or Mam, being much closer to Wastek (Huastec). History and genealogy The Chicomuceltec language was first documented in modern linguistic literature as a distinct language in the late 19th century, where it appeared in an account published by linguist Karl Sapper of his travels in northern Mesoamerica 1888–95.The work in question is Sapper 1897, with later expansions to the material appearing in Sapper 1912; as cited in Dienhart (1997), \\"Data sources listed by author\\" . Chicomuceltec's relationship with Wastek was established in the late 1930s (Kroeber 1939), which concluded via word-list comparisons with other Mayan languages that it bore a higher degree of affinity with Wastek than other Mayan language branches.See précis of Kroeber 1939, appearing in Fernández de Miranda (1968), pp.74–75. =Historical documentation= A two-page document dated to 1775 which was retrieved from the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris is the oldest- known testament of the Chicomuceltec language. Taking the form of a Roman Catholic confession, the manuscript contains eight sentences written in Chicomuceltec. It also mentions that the language was then referred to as \\"Cotoque\\".As described by Dienhart (1997), the manuscript was reproduced in Zimmermann 1955 (whose research it was which uncovered the document), accompanied by his linguistic analysis of its contents. Geographical distribution Map showing one migratory proposal for the early split of Wastek and Chicomuceltec from the Proto-Mayan \\"homeland\\". The geographical distribution of Wastek and Chicomuceltec in relation to the rest of the Mayan languages —with Wastek centered on the northern Gulf Coast region away from the others lying south and east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec— led Kroeber to also propose that Chicomuceltec was either a remnant population left behind after the Huastec people's migration north from the Chiapas highlands region, or alternatively represented a return of a Huastec subgroup to their earlier homelands.Fernández de Miranda, loc. cit. Decline and extinction By the early 20th century it was clear the language was in decline, and when in 1926 Franz Termer visited the community of Chicomucelo, he reported finding only three individuals (all over 60 years of age) who could speak Chicomuceltec, out of a township of approximately 2,500. The Chicomuceltec speakers themselves conducted their day-to-day conversations in Spanish.Termer (1930), as annotated in Dienhart, op. cit.

It is designed to wound or kill by fragmentation and resembles a large bowl. Design The MON-100 mine body has a smooth, well finished appearance with a webbing handle mounted on the upper edge. It is usually attached to a mounting shackle by wing nuts on either side of the mine body (the shackle is connected to a spike for securing the mine to buildings, trees etc.). The concave face of the mine has a detonator cavity in its center (this is the side aimed at the target). The mine contains 2 kg of explosive to propel 450 steel rod fragments to a lethal range of 100 m, at maximum range the spread of the fragmentation is 9.5 m. The mine alone weighs 5 kg but with the shackle and mounting spike the weight is 7.53 kg. The MON 100 can be command actuated using a PN manual inductor attached by demolition cable to an EDP-R electric detonator. It can also be actuated by a variety of booby trap (BT) switches including: *MUV series pull *MVE-72 electric breakwire *VP13 seismic controller. The MON-100 will usually be mounted above ground level on the surface or up in trees to give the greatest dispersion of fragments. The mine can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions. Depending on its actuation method the MON-100 may be resistant to blast overpressure from explosive breaching systems like the Giant Viper and M58 MICLIC. The mine is also produced for export to Poland.

Demining hazards Because it is a directional type of mine, it should never be approached from the front, always from the rear or side. The MON-90 is known to be used with the VP13 seismic controller which prevents close approach for any clearance operations. If the mine is encountered with any type of electrical wires running from it, secure both ends of the wire before approaching the mine, because it could be linked to another mine or other booby trap device. On detonation the mine will normally propel lethal fragmentation to a range between 75 and 125 meters. The actual hazard range for this mines can be as high as 160 metres (this is directly in front of the mine, fragmentation range and density drop off to 125 meters to the sides and rear of these mines).

Nathaniel Thayer I (July 11, 1769 – June 23, 1840) was a congregational Unitarian minister. Early life Nathaniel Thayer was born in Hampton, New Hampshire to Ebenezer Thayer and Martha Olivia Cotton. His father was a pastor in Hampton for many years. His maternal grandfather was John Cotton of Newton, Massachusetts, who was the great-grandson of John Cotton. Career Thayer graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, then Harvard College in 1789 and was ordained junior pastor of a Congregational meeting house in Lancaster, Massachusetts on October 9, 1793. In 1789 the town of Lancaster gave him land on Main street, just south of the church, to build a permanent residence. There he built a twelve-room home. He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Harvard in 1817. The Lancaster congregation's fifth meeting house designed by Charles Bulfinch in 1816, was built during his tenure. Respected for his \\"tact and sagacity\\", Thayer's involvement was often sought to settle ecclesiastical disputes across the state of Massachusetts. As a result, in his 47 years as a minister, he served on more than 150 church councils, and he frequently drew up the decisions. For a number of years, Thayer was involved in a dispute with James G. Carter, then-Deacon of Thayer's congregation and later a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, over the latter's refusal to return funds donated toward the establishment of an instructional academy that failed to materialise. Thayer publicly denounced Carter's actions and called on him to reimburse donors of the failed project. Carter, however, refused and was eventually removed from his position as the church's Deacon. Messerli (1965) argues that Carter's alienation of Thayer (and, by extension, most of the state's clergy) significantly contributed to his loss to Horace Mann in the 1837 election for the position of Secretary of the just-established Massachusetts Board of Education, the first state board of education in the United States.

It is 320 km from Auckland. Barrier Air operates daily flights to and from Auckland Airport. History On 13 June 2005, Kaitaia Airport received an injection of $333,850 to upgrade its runway facilities so that it could accommodate larger aircraft. The Far North District Council approved loan funding for Kaitaia Airport's project to allow it to accommodate aircraft with a pavement classification number of 15,000 kg in mainwheel axle weight. This upgrade would allow Air New Zealand to fly into Kaitaia with its Bombardier and ATR 72-500 aircraft. During the project, $1.4 million invested into the airport was to provide larger hardstand areas and better terminal facilities. At the end of April 2015, Air New Zealand discontinued its service between Kaitaia and Auckland. Barrier Air began operating the route with a Cessna Caravan from 28 April 2015. Aircraft transit Kaitaia Airport is the most northern airfield in New Zealand that has fuel available. It has a long and smooth runway, the longest in Northland, and is used by light aircraft, as well as private aircraft such as the Gulfstream V. 852 km to the north-west of Kaitaia is Norfolk Island Airport, from which it is 754 km to Noumea in New Caledonia, or 900 km to Lord Howe Island, which can be used as a stepping stone to the Australian mainland. These distances are within the range of many light aircraft fitted with long range tanks, while the direct distances are usually used with the larger private aircraft which are able to land at Kaitaia Airport. From New Caledonia other Pacific Islands such as Vanuatu and Fiji are within range and can be used as further 'stepping stones' to the other South Pacific and North Pacific destinations. Airlines and destinations Kaitaia Airport previously received Beechcraft 1900Ds, operated by Eagle Air on behalf of Air New Zealand, twice daily Monday–Friday and daily Saturday–Sunday. This route was taken over by Barrier Air from 28 April 2015. Other airlines also expressed interest in operating the route, including Tauranga-based Sunair. The airport is home to the Kaitaia Aero Club, which operates a small flight school from its hangar.

It was the last book to be released in the New Order series for the next eighteen years as the 29th book of the series, The Storms of Chai, was published in 2016. Gameplay In a game book, the reader makes choices to effect the outcome of the story. Lone Wolf books rely on a combination of thought and luck. Certain statistics such as combat skill and endurance attributes are determined randomly before play (reading). The player then chooses which Kai disciplines or skills they possess. This number depends directly on how many books in the series have been completed (\\"Kai rank\\"). With each additional book, the player chooses one additional Kai discipline. In this first book, the player starts with five disciplines. Plot The reader plays as one of Lone Wolf's Grand Masters. On a visit to the court of Xo-lin, news of an invasion force by the Autarch Sejanoz of Bhanar brought to the palace in Pensei. Xo-lin must be rescued and brought to sanctuary in the distant city of Tazhan across the Lissanian Plain. Reception The Hunger of Sejanoz was the last of Dever's Lone Wolf books to be published before a hiatus of eighteen years. The book is rare and sells for hundreds of dollars where copies exist. Also, the omission of 50 extra sections is controversial, as most Lone Wolf books have 350 sections and this one only 300. It is rumored that the publishers, knowing that no more books would be released, excised those last pages connecting the book to the next part of the story. At a press conference during the 2008 Lucca Comics & Games convention, Dever confirmed that the republished version of this book will contain 350 sections.

Economic theory posits that distortions change the amount and type of economic behavior from that which would occur in a free market without the tax. Excess burdens can be measured using the average cost of funds or the marginal cost of funds (MCF). Excess burdens were first discussed by Adam Smith. An equivalent kind of inefficiency can also be caused by subsidies (which technically can be viewed as taxes with negative rates). Economic losses due to taxes were evaluated to be as low as 2.5 cents per dollar of revenue, and as high as 30 cents per dollar of revenue (on average), and even much higher at the margins.See Martin Feldstein, Tax Avoidance and the Deadweight Loss of the Income Tax, 81(4), Review of Economics and Statistics (1999), at p. 674; Charles L. Ballard, John B. Shoven and John Whalley, The Welfare Cost of Distortions in the United States Tax System: A General Equilibrium Approach, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 1043. For a review of literature arguing that moving to a uniform taxation of investment will lead to 0.1% to 0.3% increase in GNP, see Lawrence H. Summers, Should Tax Reform Level the Playing Field?, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 2132, Cambridge, MA, January 1987.  Measures of the excess burden  The cost of a distortion is usually measured as the amount that would have to be paid to the people affected by its supply, the greater the excess burden. The second is the tax rate: as a general rule, the excess burden of a tax increases with the square of the tax rate. The average cost of funds is the total cost of distortions divided by the total revenue collected by a government. In contrast, the marginal cost of funds (MCF) is the size of the distortion that accompanied the last unit of revenue raised (i.e. the rate of change of distortion with respect to revenue). In most cases, the MCF increases as the amount of tax collected increases. The standard position in economics is that the costs in a cost- benefit analysis for any tax-funded project should be increased according to the marginal cost of funds, because that is close to the deadweight loss that will be experienced if the project is added to the budget, or to the deadweight loss removed if the project is removed from the budget.  Distortion and redistribution  In the case of progressive taxes, the distortionary effects of a tax may be accompanied by other benefits: the redistribution of dollars from wealthier people to poorer people who could possibly obtain more benefit from them - in effect reducing economic inequalities and improving GDP growth.Ostry Jonathan, Berg Andrew, Tsangarides Charalambos. “Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth”. Staff Discussion Notes No. 14/02, International Monetary Fund, February 2014 In fact almost any tax measure will distort the economy from the path or process that would have prevailed in its absence (land value taxes are a notable exception together with other capital or wealth taxes). For example, a sales tax applied to all goods will tend to discourage consumption of all the taxed items, and an income tax will tend to discourage people from earning money in the category of income that is taxed (unless they can manage to avoid being taxed). Some people may move out of the work force (to avoid income tax); some may move into the cash or black economies (where incomes are not revealed to the tax authorities). For example, in Western nations the incomes of the relatively affluent are taxed partly to provide the money used to assist the relatively poor. As a result of the taxes (and associated subsidies to the poor), incentives are changed for both groups. The relatively rich are discouraged from declaring income and from earning marginal (extra) income, because they know that any additional money that they earn and declare will be taxed at their highest marginal tax rates. At the same time the poor have an incentive to conceal their own taxable income (and usually their assets) so as to increase the likelihood of their receiving state assistance (welfare trap). It can be argued that the distortion of incentives (the move away from a fiscally neutral stance that does not affect incentives) does more harm than good. There was an example of distortion of the economy by tax policy some years ago in the UK when cars supplied by employers to their employees were taxed at advantageous rates (e.g. encouraging the growth of company car fleets). Over several years the distortion grew to the point that the majority of cars used by working families were company cars and the dealership structures, and even the types of cars used, altered to adjust to the tax regime.  Deliberate distortion  Not all distortions are bad; Pigovian taxes create distortions that correct for externalities and therefore have a negative MCF. Here, the fiscal distortion is deliberate, so as to compensate for externalities. \\"Sin taxes\\" are levied on products that incur additional costs to society, such as alcohol, tobacco and pollution. Ideally, these taxes raise the price to the exact level that the market would bear if the negative externalities were included in the price. Pigovian taxes are often preferable to outright prohibition, since prohibition incites trafficking, often resulting in crime and other social costs, but no revenue.

In response to an ongoing controversy in the music world over who was, in fact, the world’s fastest drummer, Boo McAfee teamed up with electrical engineer and drummer, Craig Alan Kestner, and developed the DrumometerTM to accurately count drum strokes on a drum pad.http://www.musiciansfriend.com/drums-percussion/drumometer-drumometer- model-ii#productDetail McAfee and Kestner were awarded U.S. Patent No. 6,545,207 on their invention,http://www.google.com/patents/US6545207 and began promoting “World’s Fastest Drummer®” (“WFD”) competitions with the DrumometerTM.

Photo by Ron Kestner “Extreme Sport Drumming” competitions are now regularly held worldwide, and have been featured on CNN, MTV, VH1, PBS, FOX and ESPN. Boo McAfee and Extreme Sport Drumming were recently the subject of the film Fast Company, which opened to rave reviews at the Milwaukee Film Festival on September 27, 2015. The popularity of Extreme Sport Drumming, however, has led to many imitators of the patented DrumometerTM. After trying for years to license, or stop. the sales of copycat drum stroke counting devices, McAfee has now begun filing patent infringement lawsuits with the help of patent attorney Anthony Dowell of Chicago. “I contacted all of the companies selling imitation drum stroke counting pads,” McAfee said. “Unfortunately, none of them would respect my patent rights and pay a reasonable license fee. Guitar Center told me they wouldn’t even talk to me unless I filed ‘formal proceedings.’ So that’s what we did.” “Boo’s experience is common these days,” patent attorney Anthony Dowell explained. “In today’s patent climate, companies have no respect for inventors or patent rights. Most will ignore an inventor until a patent infringement lawsuit is filed. That usually gets their attention.” Dowell has filed three patent infringement lawsuits for McAfee in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the first against Guitar Center and Yamaha on October 27, 2015 (15-cv-9555) and two more against Ahead Products, Inc. (15-cv-10395) and Cherub Technology Inc. (15-cv-10403) on November 18, 2015. WFD competitions The primary goal of most WFD competitions is to determine who can play the most single strokes in sixty seconds. According to author Josh Davis, \\"the Drumometer uncovered a deep well of competitiveness.\\" After experimenting with various WFD competition formats in the southern United States, the event achieved international prominence when respected studio and clinic drummer Johnny Rabb became the first person to break 1,000 single strokes in 60 seconds, claiming the title World's Fastest Hands and recognition from the record keepers at Guinness. McAfee and Kestner then officially sanctioned their events and copyrighted the phrase World's Fastest Drummer. This was followed by ads in Drum! and Modern Drummer magazines touting Rabb's accomplishment and their Drumometer device. Subsequently they created new classes of speed drumming: fastest feet (for two-footed bass drumming), bare hands, and tag team, among others. Drumometer orders then followed, and the race to best Rabb's feats began. Musical genres - death metal, country, jazz, screamo - have since battled for dominance in the various categories.

Although based on the god Yama of the Hindu Vedas, the Buddhist Yama has spread and developed different myths and different functions from the Hindu deity. He has also spread far more widely and is known in most countries where Buddhism is practiced, including China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Bhutan, Mongolia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. Yama in Theravāda Buddhism In the Pali canon, the Buddha states that a person who has ill-treated their parents, ascetics, holy persons, or elders is taken upon his death to Yama.See, for example, MN 130 and AN 3.35 , both of which are entitled \\"Devaduta Sutta\\" (The Divine Messengers). Yama then asks the ignoble person if he ever considered his own ill conduct in light of birth, deterioration, sickness, worldly retribution and death. In response to Yama's questions, such an ignoble person repeatedly answers that he failed to consider the karmic consequences of his reprehensible actions and as a result is sent to a brutal hell \\"so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.\\" In the Pali commentarial tradition, the scholar Buddhaghosa's commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya describes Yama as a vimānapeta (), a \\"being in a mixed state\\", sometimes enjoying celestial comforts and at other times punished for the fruits of his karma. However, Buddhaghosa considered his rule as a king to be just. Modern Theravādin countries portray Yama sending old age, disease, punishments, and other calamities among humans as warnings to behave well. At death, they are summoned before Yama, who examines their character and dispatches them to their appropriate rebirth, whether to earth or to one of the heavens or hells. Sometimes there are thought to be two or four Yamas, each presiding over a distinct Hell.According to the Majjhima Nikaya Atthakatha states that \\"there are in fact four Yamas, one at each of four gates (of hell?).\\" The paranthetical expression is from the text. Yama in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese mythology Miyazu, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. Statue of Yama (Enma) at Nariai-ji In Chinese mythology, King Yan () is the god of death and the ruler of Diyu, overseeing the \\"Ten Kings of Hell\\". He is also known as Yanluo (), a transcription of the Sanskrit for King Yama (, Yama Rājā). In both ancient and modern times, Yan is portrayed as a large man with a scowling red face, bulging eyes, and a long beard. He wears traditional robes and a judge's cap or a crown which bears the character for \\"king\\" (). He typically appears on Chinese hell money in the position reserved for political figures on regular currency. Yan is not only the ruler but also the judge of the underworld and passes judgment on all the dead. He always appears in a male form, and his minions include a judge who holds in his hands a brush and a book listing every soul and the allotted death date for every life. Ox-Head and Horse-Face, the fearsome guardians of hell, bring the newly dead, one by one, before Yan for judgement. Men or women with merit will be rewarded good future lives or even revival in their previous life. Men or women who committed misdeeds will be sentenced to suffering or miserable future lives. In some versions, Yan divides Diyu into eight, ten, or eighteen courts each ruled by a Yan King, such as King Chujiang, who rules the court reserved for thieves and murderers. The spirits of the dead, on being judged by Yan, are supposed to either pass through a term of enjoyment in a region midway between the earth and the heaven of the gods or to undergo their measure of punishment in the nether world. Neither location is permanent and after a time, they return to Earth in new bodies. \\"Yan\\" was sometimes considered to be a position in the celestial hierarchy, rather than an individual. There were said to be cases in which an honest mortal was rewarded the post of Yan and served as the judge and ruler of the underworld. Some said common people like Bao Zheng, Fan Zhongyan, Zhang Binglin became the Yan at night or after death. These Chinese beliefs subsequently spread to Korea and Japan. In Japan, he is called Enma (, prev. \\"Yenma\\"), King Enma (, Enma-ō), and Great King Enma (, Enma Dai-Ō). In Korea, Yan is known as Yeom-ra () and Great King Yeom-ra' (, Yŏm-ra Daewang). In Vietnam, these Buddhist deities are known as Diêm La or Diêm Vương and are venerated as a council of all ten kings who oversee underworld realm of địa ngục. is a superstition in Japan often told to scare children into telling the truth. A Japanese proverb states . Jizō is typically portrayed with a serene, happy expression whereas Enma is typically portrayed with a thunderous, furious expression. The kotowaza alludes to changes in people's behaviour for selfish reasons depending on their circumstances. Yama in Tibetan Buddhism Yama, The Metropolitan Museum of Art In Tibetan Buddhism, Shinje (Tibetan: གཤིན་རྗེ་, Gshin.rje) is both regarded with horror as the prime mover of the cycle of death and rebirth and revered as a guardian of spiritual practice. In the popular mandala of the Bhavachakra, all of the realms of life are depicted between the jaws or in the arms of a monstrous Shinje. Shinje is sometimes shown with a consort, Yami, and sometimes pursued by Yamantaka (conqueror of death). 19th century kagamibuta netsuke depicting Enma In popular culture *In the anime series Hell Girl, the titular protagonist is called Ai Enma. *In the One Piece manga series, a legendary Katana was named Enma after the Buddhist King of Hell. *In the 2012 video game, Spelunky, he is the secret Final Boss, located in 5-4 of Hell.

It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. Sukarno believed that parliamentarian system implemented during the liberal democracy period was ineffective due to Indonesia's divisive political situation at that time. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. With the introduction of this system, Indonesia returned to the presidential system and Sukarno became the head of government again. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme ('nationalism'), agama ('religion'), and komunisme ('communism') into a co-operative Nas-A-Kom (or Nasakom) governmental concept. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics — the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed in February 1957 'Guided Democracy' and proposed a cabinet representing all major political parties (including the Communist Party of Indonesia, although the latter were never actually given functional cabinet positions). From that time, there was no Western-style general election in Indonesia until the 1999 election of the Reformasi era. Background The Liberal democracy period, from the re-establishment of the unitary Republic of Indonesia in 1950 until the declaration of martial law in 1957, saw the rise and fall of six cabinets, the longest-lasting surviving for just under two years. Even Indonesia's first national elections in 1955 failed to bring about political stability. In 1957, Indonesia faced a series of crises, including the beginning of the Permesta rebellion in Makassar and the army takeover of authority in South Sumatra, due to the increasing dissatisfaction of non-Javanese Indonesians to the centralization policy implemented by Jakarta. One of the demands of the Permesta rebels was that 70 percent of the members of Sukarno's proposed National Council should be members from the regions (non-Javanese). Another demand was that the cabinet and National Council be led by the dual-leaders (Indonesian: dwitunggal) of Sukarno and former Vice-President Hatta.. In March 1957, Sukarno accepted the Army chief of staff General Abdul Haris Nasution's proposal for a declaration of martial law across the whole nation. This would put the armed forces in charge, and would be a way to deal with the rebellious army commanders, as it would effectively legitimise them.. In the face of a growing political crisis amid splits in the cabinet, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo returned his mandate to the president on 14 March. =Establishment of Guided Democracy= Sukarno President Sukarno made an official visit to the People's Republic of China in October 1956. He was impressed with the progress made there since the Civil War, and concluded that this was due to the strong leadership of Mao Zedong, whose centralisation of power was in sharp contrast to the political disorder in Indonesia. According to former foreign minister Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, Sukarno began to believe he had been \\"chosen by providence\\" to lead the people and \\"build a new society\\".Ide Anak Agung, (1973) pp. 251–2. Shortly after his return from China, on 30 October 1956, Sukarno spoke of his konsepsi (conception) of a new system of government. Two days earlier he had called for the political parties to be abolished. Initially the parties were opposed to the idea, but once it became clear that they would not need to be abolished, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) threw its support behind Sukarno. As well as the PKI, the Indonesian National Party (PNI) supported Sukarno, while the Islamist Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party of Indonesia opposed the plan. There were demonstrations in support of it. On 21 February 1957, Sukarno detailed his plan. Sukarno pointed out that at the village level, important questions were decided by lengthy deliberation with the goal of achieving a consensus. This model of decision-making, he said, was better suited to the nature of Indonesia than the Western-style voting system. While deliberations at the local level were guided by the village elders, Sukarno envisioned that the president would guide them at the national level. The centerpiece would be a 'mutual co-operation' cabinet of the major parties advised by a National Council (Indonesian: Dewan Nasional) of functional groups, while the legislature would not be abolished. Sukarno argued that under this system, a national consensus could express itself under presidential guidance. On 15 March 1957 President Sukarno appointed PNI chairman Soewirjo to form a \\"working cabinet\\", which would be tasked with establishing the National Council in accordance with the president's concept. However, since Masyumi, the largest opposition party, was not asked to participate in the formation of the cabinet, Soewirjo's efforts came to nothing. However, on 25 March, Sukarno asked Soewirjo to try form a cabinet again in one week to, but to no avail, Soewirjo failed. Finally, Sukarno held a meeting with 69 party figures at the State Palace on 4 April 1957, at which he announced his intention to form an emergency extra-parliamentary working cabinet, whose members Sukarno would choose. The new \\"Working Cabinet\\", headed by non-partisan prime minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja was announced on 8 April 1957 at Bogor Palace. Although the PKI was not included, several members were sympathetic to the party. In theory, it was a non-partisan cabinet. The National Council was established by emergency law in May 1957. It was chaired by Sukarno, with Ruslan Abdulgani as vice-chairman. At its inauguration on 12 July, it had 42 members representing groups such as peasants, workers and women, as well as the various religions. Decisions were reached by consensus rather than through voting. As a non- political body based on functional groups, it was intended as a counterbalance to the political system. The cabinet was not obliged to heed the advice given by the National Council, but in practice they rarely ignored it.Lev (2009) pp. 37–43. Meanwhile, the armed forces were trying to enhance their political role by establishing functional groups of their own. Nasution began trying to woo the parties' functional groups in June 1957, and managed to unite the many veterans' organizations under army control. He also used martial law to arrest several politicians for alleged corruption, while regional army commanders restricted party activities, particularly those of the PKI, whose headquarters in Jakarta was attacked in July. In his Independence Day address on 17 August 1957, Sukarno laid down the ideology of guided democracy, later renamed the Manipol (Political manifesto). This was later expanded into the ideology known as USDEK -- standing for the 1945 Constitution (Undang-Undang Dasar 1945), Indonesian socialism (Sosialisme ala Indonesia), guided democracy (Demokrasi Terpimpin), guided economy (Ekonomi Terpimpin) and Indonesian identity (Kepribadian Indonesia). =Regional rebellions during the liberal democracy era= In the midst of the Cold War, the CIA—along with the UK and Australian governments—supported rebellions in Sumatra and Sulawesi during 1958. These rebellions were launched as reactions to Sukarno's seizure of parliamentarian power, the increasing influence of the Communists, the corruption and mismanagement of the central government, and against the domination by Java of the outer islands. In September and October 1957, various rebellious army officers, including members of the Permesta movement, held meetings in Sumatra. They agreed on three objectives: the appointment of a president less in favor of the PKI, the replacement of Nasution as the head of armed forces and the banning of the PKI. Some of these regional rebels were subsequently accused of involvement in the assassination attempt on Sukarno on November 30. On February 10, 1958, rebels including army officers and Masyumi leaders meeting in Padang, Sumatra, issued an ultimatum to the government demanding the return of parliamentary system, through the dissolution of the cabinet, elections and Sukarno's position as a figurehead role. Five days later, the formation of Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI), announced. It was based in Bukittinggi, Sumatra, joined two days later by the Permesta rebels in Sulawesi. Despite US support in the form of arms for the PRRI rebels, the Indonesian military defeated the rebels with a combination of aerial bombardment and operations by troops landed from Java. By the middle of 1958, the rebellions had been effectively quashed but guerrilla activity persisted for three years. Amnesty was granted to rebel leaders although their political parties were banned. Early nationalist leaders were discredited, including former Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir, who along with others was arrested in 1962. Formation = Return to the 1945 Constitution = The structure of the Indonesian government in 1962 In 1958, Masyumi and the Nahdlatul Ulama, which had split from Masyumi in 1952, called for the planned 1959 elections to be postponed as they feared a PKI victory. In September, prime minister Djuanda announced the postponement. Meanwhile, the Constitutional Assembly was still unable to reach agreement on the basis of a new constitution, and was deadlocked between those who wanted Indonesia to be an Islamic state, and those who supported the idea of the state based on the Pancasila ideology. In July, Nasution proposed returning to the 1945 Constitution, and in September, he resumed political activity. Sukarno quickly endorsed this idea, as the 1945 document made the president head of government as well as head of state and would thus be better suited to implementing Guided democracy. Under the Provisional Constitution of 1950, the president's role was largely ceremonial as head of state, though Sukarno commanded great moral authority due to his status as Father of the Nation. Gradually, the return to the 1945 Constitution gained support from the political parties, and on July 5, 1959, Sukarno issued a decree (formally Presidential Decree number 150 of 1959 on the Return to the Constitution of 1945) to reinstate the 1945 constitution and dissolving the Constitutional Assembly. Four days later, a working cabinet with Sukarno as prime minister was announced, and in July, the National Council and Supreme Advisory Council were established. Although political parties continued to exist, only the PKI had any real strength. Political landscape = Marginalization of Islamic political parties = After the dissolution of the Constitutional Assembly, Sukarno banned Masyumi in 1960 due to its leaders' ties with the PRRI and strong opposition against the new form of government. The representation of Islamic parties in the parliament were down to 25 percent, while Nahdlatul Ulama's influence also reduced even though its official stance was to support the implementation of guided democracy. =Rise of the PKI= In an attempt to strengthen his position in his rivalry with Nasution, Sukarno gradually became closer to the PKI and to the Indonesian Air Force. In March 1960, Sukarno dissolved the legislature after it had rejected his budget. In June, the Mutual Cooperation House of People's Representatives (DPR-GR), in which the armed services and police had representation as functional groups, and a Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) were established, with the PKI chairman, D.N. Aidit, as a deputy chairman. The PKI was estimated to have 17–25 percent of the seats in the DPR-GR, and now had representation in all institutions of state except the cabinet. Despite actions against the PKI by regional army commanders, Sukarno repeatedly defended it. Sukarno also began pushing his ideology uniting Nationalism, Religion and Communism, which would become known as Nasakom. It is an acronym based on the Indonesian words NASionalisme ('nationalism'), Agama ('religion'), and KOMunisme ('communism'). alternate version at Google Books with preview The Nasakom ideology was an attempt by Sukarno to create an Indonesian form of socialism which would mix socialist and nationalist ideas and adapt them to the unique Indonesian situation of a nation of thousands of islands, many ethnic groups, and diverse religions. However, the army's successes in defeating various rebellions, including the PRRI and the Darul Islam movement in west Java meant that Nasution still had the initiative. Later that year, the PKI began a \\"unilateral action\\" (Indonesian: aksi sepihak) campaign to implement the 1959–60 land reform laws, which led to violent conflict with NU supporters. Therefore, in December 1960, Sukarno established the Supreme Operations Command (KOTI), to ensure that the campaign to liberate West Irian from the Dutch would not be controlled by the military. Actual combat operations were to be directed by the Mandala command, headed by (future president) Major-General Suharto, who was the first commander of the Kostrad. The PKI, anxious to make use of the nationalism issue to cement its alliance with Sukarno, wholeheartedly supported this effort.Mortimer 1974, pp. 175–7. In June 1962, Sukarno managed to foil an attempt by Nasution to be appointed armed forces commander; he instead became chief of staff with no direct military commanding role, although he kept his position as minister of defence and security. By 1962, the PKI had over two million members, and in March, Sukarno made two of its key figures, Aidit and Njoto, ministers without portfolio. That same year, the West Irian dispute was resolved after the Dutch agreeing a transfer to UN administration. It was later formally annexed by Indonesia after the controversial 'Act of Free Choice' in 1969.. In early 1965, Aidit proposed to Sukarno the creation of \\"the Fifth Force\\" (i.e. in addition to the army, navy, air force and police), made up of armed workers and peasants and the appointment of Nasakom advisers to each of the armed forces. This was a direct threat to the armed services. In 1965, Sukarno announced the discovery of a document allegedly written by the British ambassador, the so-called Gilchrist Document, which was touted as proof of armed forces-led plots against the government. = Rise of the political roles of the armed forces and police = The 1960 decision by Sukarno to appoint sectoral representatives each to the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly and the Mutual Cooperation - People's Representative Council began 44 years of a military and police presence in the legislature. Some of the 241 sectoral MPs appointed to the PPCA were active duty personnel of the armed forces and police which gave an even more political role for the armed forces, which served as counterbalance to the PKI presence in the legislature. These armed forces and police representatives thus formed a loyal oppostion to the PKI in the legislative branch. To counter the PKI-supported Central All-Indonesian Workers Organization, the SOKSI (Central Workers' Organization of Indonesia) was established in late 1961 with strong armed forces support, three years later, in October 1964, the Sekber Golkar (Sekretariat Bersama Golongan Karya, or Joint Secretariat of Functional Groups), the future Golkar Party, was established to unite the many anti- communist organizations that have been led and sponsored by the armed forces and police. Among the 60 armed forces organizations under the Golkar umbrella, aside from the SOKSI, were the Kosgoro (Union of Mutual Cooperation Multifunction Organizations), MKGR (Mutual Assistance Families Association) and the Gerakan Karya Rakyat (People's Working Movement). Even as some personnel in the armed forces and police sided with the PKI and many were either sympathizers or joining in increasing numbers (including personnel of the Marine Corps, Air Force and the Police Mobile Brigade Corps), majority of the active military personnel and sworn police officers were anti-Communists, including many top Army officers. Aside from the legislative branch, the armed forces and police also began to be present even in the executive, with Sukarno appointing many officers from the services to government ministries in the state cabinet aside from the Ministry of Defense and Security. In the March 1963 General Session of the PPCA in Bandung in West Java, Sukarno, in a major violation of the 1945 Constitution, was elected to the life presidency (Presiden Seumur Hidup/Panglima Besar Revolusi) with the help of the armed forces and police, including their deputies to the assembly as suggested by Nasution, in a major blow to the PKI's plans for the presidential post.  Economy  Following the failure of a United Nations resolution calling on the Netherlands to negotiate with Indonesia over the West Irian issue, on 3 December, PKI and PNI unions began taking over Dutch companies, but 11 days later, Nasution stated that personnel from the armed forces would run these companies instead. This action then gave the armed forces a major economic role in the country. On 25 August 1959, the government implemented sweeping anti-inflationary measures, devaluing the currency by 75 percent and declaring that all Rp. 500 and Rp. 1000 notes would henceforth be worth one tenth of their face value. Meanwhile, anti-ethnic Chinese measures, including repatriations and forced transfer to cities, damaged economic confidence further. In 1960, inflation had reached 100 percent per annum.  Foreign policy  = West Irian dispute and liberation = After the recognition of Indonesia as a sovereign state (soevereiniteitsoverdracht) on 27 December 1949, both Indonesia and The Netherlands agreed that the issue regarding the status of Nieuw-Guinea or West Irian (present-day Papua and West Papua) will be negotiated one year after the formation of the federal government. Indonesia rejected Netherlands proposal to retain the sovereignty over the territory, considering it as an integral part of the country.Bob Catley and Vinsensio Dugis, The Garuda and The Kangaroo, pp.20–21. On 15 February 1952, the Dutch Parliament voted to incorporate New Guinea into the realm of the Netherlands. After that, the Netherlands refused further discussion on the question of sovereignty and considered the issue to be closed.Audrey and George Kahin, Subversion as Foreign Policy, p.45Soedjati Djiwandono, Konfrontasi Revisited, 1-2 On 23 February 1957, a thirteen country–sponsored resolution (Bolivia, Burma, Ceylon, Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Yugoslavia) calling for the United Nations to appoint a \\"good offices commission\\" for West New Guinea was submitted to the UN General Assembly. Despite receiving a plural majority (40-25-13), this second resolution failed to gain a two-thirds majority. Undeterred, the Afro-Asian caucus in the United Nations lobbied for the West New Guinea dispute to be included on the UNGA's agenda. On 4 October 1957, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio warned that Indonesia would embark on \\"another cause\\" if the United Nations failed to bring about a solution to the dispute that favoured Indonesia. That month, the Indonesian Communist Party and affiliated trade unions lobbied for retaliatory economic measures against the Dutch. On 26 November 1957, a third Indonesian resolution on the West New Guinea dispute was put to the vote but failed to gain a two-thirds majority (41-29-11). In response, Indonesia took retaliatory measure against Dutch interests in Indonesia.Nicholas Tarling, pp. 114-119, 129-132 Following a sustained period of harassment against Dutch diplomatic representatives in Jakarta, the Indonesian government formally severed relations with the Netherlands in August 1960.John D. Legge, Sukarno: A Political Biography, pp.402–03 By 1960, other countries in the Asia-Pacific region had taken notice of the West Irian dispute and began proposing initiatives to end the dispute. During a visit to the Netherlands, the New Zealand Prime Minister Walter Nash suggested the idea of a united New Guinea state, consisting of both Dutch and Australian territories. This idea received little support from both the Indonesians and other Western governments. Later that year, the Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman proposed a three-step initiative, which involved West New Guinea coming under United Nations trusteeship. The joint administrators would be three non-aligned nations Ceylon, India, and Malaya, which supported Indonesia's position on West Irian. This solution involved the two belligerents, Indonesia and the Netherlands, re-establishing bilateral relations and the return of Dutch assets and investments to their owners. However, this initiative was scuttled in April 1961 due to opposition from the Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, who publicly attacked the Tunku's proposal.Michael Green, \\"Uneasy Partners\\", pp.159–60 On 23 November 1961, the Indian delegation at the United Nations presented a draft resolution calling for the resumption of Dutch–Indonesian talks on terms which favoured Indonesia. On 25 November 1961, several Francophone African countries tabled a rival resolution which favoured an independent West New Guinea. The Indonesians favoured the Indian resolution while the Dutch, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand supported the Francophone African resolution. On 27 November 1961, both the Francophone African (52-41-9) and Indian (41-40-21) resolutions were put to the vote failed to gain a two–thirds majority at the United Nations General Assembly. The failure of this final round of diplomacy in the UN convinced the Indonesians to prepare for a military invasion of West Irian.\\"West New Guinea,\\" in \\"The Month in the United Nations: Sixteenth Session of the General Assembly,\\" External Affairs Review (New Zealand) XI, no. II (November 1961): pp. 49-50.Nicholas Tarling, Britain and the West New Guinea Dispute, pp. 400-418. On 19 December 1961, President Sukarno gave orders for the Indonesian military to prepare for a full–scale military invasion of the territory; codenamed Operation Trikora. He also ordered the creation of a special People's Triple Command or Tri Komando Rakyat (Trikora) with the objective of 'liberating' West New Guinea by 1 January 1963. Trikora's operational command was to be called the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat) and was led by Major-General Suharto, the future President of Indonesia. In preparation for the planned invasion, the Mandala command began making land, air, and sea incursions into West Irian. General Suharto also planned to launch a full- scale amphibious operation invasion of West Irian known as Operation Jayawijaya (or Operation Djajawidjaja).Bilveer Singh, West Irian and the Suharto Presidency, p.86Soedjati Djiwandono, Konfrontasi Revisited, p. 131 On 24 June 1962, four Indonesian Air Force C-130 Hercules jets dropped 213 paratroopers near Merauke. Throughout the year, a total of 1,200 Indonesian paratroopers and 340 naval infiltrators landed in West New Guinea. By mid-1962, the Indonesian military had begun preparations to launch Operation Jayawijaya around August 1962. This operation was to be carried out in four phases and would have involved joint air and naval strikes against Dutch airfields, paratroop and amphibious landings at Biak and Sentani, and a ground assault on the territory's capital Hollandia. Unknown to the Indonesians, Dutch intelligence agency Marid 6 NNG had intercepted Indonesian transmissions and obtained intelligence on Indonesian battle plans. However, a ceasefire agreement known as the New York Agreement, which facilitated the transfer of West New Guinea to Indonesia control by 1963, was signed by the Dutch and Indonesians on 15 August 1962. As a result, the Trikora Command cancelled Operation Jayawijaya on 17 August 1962.Wies Platje, pp.305–07. = Confrontation with Malaysia = In 1963 the establishment of Malaysia was announced, incorporating Federation of Malaya and the former British colonial possessions in northern Borneo. Indonesia rejected the formation as a neo- colonialist project of the United Kingdom. The Philippines also rejected the formation due to its claim to Sabah. PKI once again sought to exploit the issue to strengthen its political position. They organised mass demonstrations in Jakarta, during which the British Embassy was burned to the ground. On 17 September, a day after Malaysia was established, Indonesia broke off diplomatic relations with Malaysia, and shortly after, the low level conflict known as konfrontasi (confrontation) was commenced. Meanwhile, the army led by Lt. General Ahmad Yani became increasingly concerned with the worsening domestic situation and began to secretly contacted the Malaysian government, while managing to obstruct the confrontation to minimal level. This was implemented to preserve an already exhausted army recently conducted the Operation Trikora, while also maintaining its political position. At the same time, both the Soviet Union and the United States began courting the Indonesian army. The Soviet Union was anxious to reduce the influence of the China-oriented PKI, while the US was worried about communism per se, and large numbers of Indonesian officers travelled to the US for military training. However, during the confrontation the PKI was also targeting the army, and was attempting to infiltrate it. Sukarno withdrew Indonesia from the United Nations on 7 January 1965 when, with U.S. backing, Malaysia took a seat on UN Security Council. The confrontation largely subsided after the September 30 Movement weakened Sukarno's political standing. Both countries signed the Bangkok Accords on 16 August 1966, albeit protest from Sukarno. Relations between both countries were fully restored on 31 August 1967. End of Guided Democracy During his 1964 Independence Day speech, Sukarno publicly denounced the United States. An anti-American campaign ensued in which American companies were threatened, American movies were banned, American libraries and other buildings were attacked, American journalists banned, and the American flag was often torn apart. Large anti-American propaganda posters were set up around Jakarta's streets. American aid was stopped.Hughes, John (2002), The End of Sukarno – A Coup that Misfired: A Purge that Ran Wild, Archipelago Press, p. 21, In August 1965, Sukarno announced that Indonesia was withdrawing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and in his Independence Day speech on 17 August, announced the Jakarta-Phnom Penh- Hanoi-Peking-Pyongyang Axis, and said that the people would be armed in the coming months. On 27 September, General Nasution announced that he opposed the planned \\"fifth force\\" formation and the \\"Nasakomization\\" of the entire armed forces. On the night of 30 September 1965, six generals were kidnapped and murdered and a group calling itself the 30 September Movement seized control of the national radio station and the centre of Jakarta. Although the movement was quickly crushed by Suharto it marked the end of guided democracy and of Sukarno as an effective president. The New Order regime established by Suharto had its own ideology -- Pancasila Democracy.

It was originally developed to help patients with brain injuries or psychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder. It can be contrasted with cranial electrotherapy stimulation, which generally uses alternating current the same way. Research shows increasing evidence for tDCS as a treatment for depression. There is mixed evidence about whether tDCS is useful for cognitive enhancement in healthy people. There is no good evidence that tDCS is useful for memory deficits in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, non-neuropathic pain, or improving upper limb function after stroke. tDCS efficacy in medical use = Depression = In 2015, the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) found tDCS to be safe and to appear effective for depression treatment, although more and larger studies was needed at that point. Since then, several studies and meta- analysis have been conducted that add to the evidence of tDCS as a safe and effective treatment for depression. A meta-analysis was published in 2020 summarising results across nine eligible studies (572 participants), presenting moderate/high certainty of evidence. Active tDCS was significantly superior to sham for response (30.9% vs. 18.9% respectively), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%) and depression improvement. According to a 2016 meta analysis published in the British Journal Psychology, 34% of tDCS-treated patients showed at least 50% symptom reduction (compared to 19% placebo) across 6 randomised controlled trials. = Other medical use = Recent research on tDCS has shown promising results in treating other mental health conditions such as anxiety and PTSD. More research is required on the topic. There is also evidence that tDCS is useful in treating neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury and improving activities of daily living assessment after stroke. tDCS safety - adverse effects and contraindications According to the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the evidence on tDCS for depression raises no major safety concerns. As of 2017, at stimulation up to 60 min and up to 4 mA over two weeks, adverse effects include skin irritation, a phosphene at the start of stimulation, nausea, headache, dizziness, and itching under the electrode. Typical treatment sessions lasting for about 20–30 minutes repeated daily for several weeks in the treatment of depression. Adverse effects of long term treatment were not known as of 2017. Nausea most commonly occurs when the electrodes are placed above the mastoid for stimulation of the vestibular system. A phosphene is a brief flash of light that can occur if an electrode is placed near the eye. People susceptible to seizures, such as people with epilepsy should not receive tDCS. Studies have been completed to determine the current density at which overt brain damage occurs in rats. It was found that in cathodal stimulation, a current density of 142.9 A/m2 delivering a charge density of 52400 C/m2 or higher caused a brain lesion in the rat. This is over two orders of magnitude higher than protocols that were in use as of 2009. Mechanism of action tDCS stimulates and activates brain cells by delivering electrical signals. The way that the stimulation changes brain function is either by causing the neuron’s resting membrane potential to depolarize or hyperpolarize. When positive stimulation (anodal tDCS) is delivered, the current causes a depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which increases neuronal excitability and allows for more spontaneous cell firing. When negative stimulation (cathodal tDCS) is delivered, the current causes a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. This decreases neuron excitability due to the decreased spontaneous cell firing. In case of treating depression, tDCS currents specifically target the left side of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) located in the frontal lobe. Left DLPFC has been shown to be associated with lower activity in the depressed population. One of the aspects of tDCS is its ability to achieve cortical changes even after the stimulation is ended. The duration of this change depends on the length of stimulation as well as the intensity of stimulation. The effects of stimulation increase as the duration of stimulation increases or the strength of the current increases. tDCS has been proposed to promote both long term potentiation and long term depression, and further research is needed for validation. Operation Transcranial direct current stimulation works by sending constant, low direct current through the electrodes. When these electrodes are placed in the region of interest, the current induces intracerebral current flow. This current flow then either increases or decreases the neuronal excitability in the specific area being stimulated based on which type of stimulation is being used. This change of neuronal excitability leads to alteration of brain function, which can be used in various therapies as well as to provide more information about the functioning of the human brain. =Parts= Transcranial direct current stimulation is a relatively simple technique requiring only a few parts. These include two electrodes and a battery-powered device that delivers constant current. Control software can also be used in experiments that require multiple sessions with differing stimulation types so that neither the person receiving the stimulation nor the experimenter knows which type is being administered. Each device has an anodal, positively charged electrode and a cathodal, negative electrode. Current is \\"conventionally\\" described as flowing from the positive anode, through the intervening conducting tissue, to the cathode, creating a circuit. Note that in traditional electric circuits constructed from metal wires, current flow is created by the motion of negatively charged electrons, which actually flow from cathode to anode. However, in biological systems, such as the head, current is usually created by the flow of ions, which may be positively or negatively charged—positive ions will flow towards the cathode; negative ions will flow toward the anode. The device may control the current as well as the duration of stimulation. =Setup= To set up the tDCS device, the electrodes and the skin need to be prepared. This ensures a low resistance connection between the skin and the electrode. The careful placement of the electrodes is crucial to successful tDCS technique. The electrode pads come in various sizes with benefits to each size. A smaller sized electrode achieves a more focused stimulation of a site while a larger electrode ensures that the entirety of the region of interest is being stimulated. If the electrode is placed incorrectly, a different site or more sites than intended may be stimulated resulting in faulty results. One of the electrodes is placed over the region of interest and the other electrode, the reference electrode, is placed in another location in order to complete the circuit. This reference electrode is usually placed on the neck or shoulder of the opposite side of the body than the region of interest. Since the region of interest may be small, it is often useful to locate this region before placing the electrode by using a brain imaging technique such as fMRI or PET. Once the electrodes are placed correctly, the stimulation can be started. Many devices have a built-in capability that allows the current to be \\"ramped up\\" or increased gradually until the necessary current is reached. This decreases the amount of stimulation effects felt by the person receiving the tDCS. After the stimulation has been started, the current will continue for the amount of time set on the device and then will automatically be shut off. Recently a new approach has been introduced where instead of using two large pads, multiple (more than two) smaller sized gel electrodes are used to target specific cortical structures. This new approach is called High Definition tDCS (HD- tDCS). In a pilot study, HD-tDCS was found to have greater and longer lasting motor cortex excitability changes than sponge tDCS. =Types of stimulation= There are three different types of stimulation: anodal, cathodal, and sham. The anodal stimulation is positive (V+) stimulation that increases the neuronal excitability of the area being stimulated. Cathodal (V-) stimulation decreases the neuronal excitability of the area being stimulated. Cathodal stimulation can treat psychiatric disorders that are caused by the hyper- activity of an area of the brain. Sham stimulation is used as a control in experiments. Sham stimulation emits a brief current but then remains off for the remainder of the stimulation time. With sham stimulation, the person receiving the tDCS does not know that they are not receiving prolonged stimulation. By comparing the results in subjects exposed to sham stimulation with the results of subjects exposed to anodal or cathodal stimulation, researchers can see how much of an effect is caused by the current stimulation, rather than by the placebo effect. = At-home administration of tDCS = Recently, tDCS devices are being researched and created intended for at-home use - ranging from treating medical conditions such as depression to enhancing general cognitive well-being. History The basic design of tDCS, using direct current (DC) to stimulate the area of interest, has existed for over 100 years. There were a number of rudimentary experiments completed before the 19th century using this technique that tested animal and human electricity. Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta were two such researchers that utilized the technology of tDCS in their explorations of the source of animal cell electricity. It was due to these initial studies that tDCS was first brought into the clinical scene. In 1801, Giovanni Aldini (Galvani's nephew) started a study in which he successfully used the technique of direct current stimulation to improve the mood of melancholy patients. (Lanzarini pdf 5 of 9) *Aldini J. Essai théorique et expérimental sur le galvanisme, avec une série d’expériences faites devant des commissaires de l’Institut national de France, et en divers amphithéâtres anatomiques de Londres. Paris: Fournier Fils, 1804. There was a brief rise of interest in transcranial direct current stimulation in the 1960s when studies by researcher D. J. Albert proved that the stimulation could affect brain function by changing the cortical excitability.Albert, D. J. (1966). The effect of spreading depression on the consolidation of learning. Neuropsychologia, 4. He also discovered that positive and negative stimulation had different effects on the cortical excitability. . Research continued, further fueled by knowledge gained from other techniques like TMS and fMRI. Comparison to other devices Transcranial electrical stimulation techniques. While tDCS uses constant current intensity, tRNS and tACS use oscillating current. The vertical axis represents the current intensity in milliamp (mA), while the horizontal axis illustrates the time-course. In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), an electric coil is held above the region of interest on the scalp that uses rapidly changing magnetic fields to induce small electrical currents in the brain. There are two types of TMS: repetitive TMS and single pulse TMS. Both are used in research therapy but effects lasting longer than the stimulation period are only observed in repetitive TMS. Similar to tDCS, an increase or decrease in neuronal activity can be achieved using this technique, but the method of how this is induced is very different. Transcranial direct current stimulation has the two different directions of current that cause the different effects. Increased neuronal activity is induced in repetitive TMS by using a higher frequency and decreased neuronal activity is induced by using a lower frequency. Variants related to tDCS include tACS, tPCS and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a group of technologies commonly referred to as transcranial electrical stimulation, or TES. Research = tDCS and depression = Latest research on tDCS has shown increasing evidence for the treatment of depression. A systematic review of placebo-controlled trials on tDCS was published recently in 2020. The meta-analysis collated results across nine eligible studies (572 participants) up until December 2018 to estimate odds ratio (OR) and number needed to treat (NNT) of response and remission, and depression improvement. The results showed statistically superior efficacy of active tDCS compared to sham for Nine eligible studies (572 participants), presenting moderate/high certainty of evidence, were included. Active tDCS was significantly superior to sham for response (30.9% vs. 18.9% respectively; OR = 1.96, 95%CI [1.30–2.95], NNT = 9), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%, OR = 1.94 [1.19–3.16], NNT = 13) and depression improvement (effect size of β = 0.31, [0.15–0.47]). Previously, a 2016 meta-analysis showed that 34% of tDCS-treated patients showed at least 50% symptom reduction (compared to 19% placebo). A 2017 study conducted by Brunoni showed 6-weeks of tDCS treatment resulted in reduction of at least half of depression symptoms in 41% of depressed people (vs. 22% placebo and 47% antidepressants). In 2015, the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) found tDCS to be safe and to appear effective for depression treatment. Up until 2014, there have been several small randomized clinical trials (RCT) in major depressive disorder (MDD); most found alleviation of depressive symptoms. There have been only two RCTs in treatment-resistant MDD; both were small, and one found an effect and the other did not. One meta-analysis of the data focused on reduction in symptoms and found an effect compared to sham treatment, but another that was focused on relapse found no effect compared to sham. = tDCS beyond depression = In 2016, European meta analysis has found level B evidence (probable efficacy) for fibromyalgia, depression and craving. There is mixed evidence about whether tDCS is useful for cognitive enhancement in healthy people. Several reviews have found evidence of small yet significant cognitive improvements. Other reviews found no evidence at all, although one of them has been criticized for overlooking within-subject effects and evidence from multiple-session tDCS trials. There is no good evidence that tDCS is useful for memory deficits in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, non-neuropathic pain, or improving upper limb function after stroke. A 2015 review of results from hundreds of tDCS experiments found that there was no statistically conclusive evidence to support any net cognitive effect, positive or negative, of single session tDCS in healthy populations - there is no evidence that tDCS is useful for cognitive enhancement. A second study by the same authors found there was little-to-no statistically reliable impact of tDCS on any neurophysiologic outcome. A few clinical trials have been conducted on the use of tDCS to ameliorate memory deficits in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and healthy subjects, with mixed results. A 2016 Cochrane review found evidence that tDSC can improve activities of daily living in Parkinson’s disease but the evidence was very low to moderate quality. Research conducted as of 2013 in schizophrenia, has found that while large effect sizes were initially found for symptom improvement, later and larger studies have found smaller effect sizes (see also section on use of tDCS in psychiatric disorders below). Studies have mostly concentrated on positive symptoms like auditory hallucinations; research on negative symptoms is lacking. In addition to the tDCS research in depression, tDCS has been studied in reversing cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Some researchers are investigating potential applications such as the improvement of focus and concentration. tDCS has also been studied in addiction. Research conducted as of 2012 on the use of tDCS to treat pain, found that the research has been of low quality and cannot be used as a basis to recommend use of tDCS to treat pain. In chronic pain following spinal cord injury, research is of high quality and has found tDCS to be ineffective. In stroke, research conducted as of 2014, has found that tDCS is not effective for improving upper limb function after stroke. While some reviews have suggested an effect of tDCS for improving post-stroke aphasia, a 2015 Cochrane review could find no improvement from combining tDCS with conventional treatment. Research conducted as of 2013 suggests that tDCS may be effective for improve vision deficits following stroke. tDCS has also been used in neuroscience research, particularly to try to link specific brain regions to specific cognitive tasks or psychological phenomena. The cerebellum has been a focus of research, due to its high concentration of neurons, its location immediately below the skull, and its multiple reciprocal anatomical connections to motor and associative parts of the brain. Most such studies focus on the impact of cerebellar tDCS on motor, cognitive, and affective functions in healthy and patient populations, but some also employ tDCS over the cerebellum to study the functional connectivity of the cerebellum to other areas of the brain. Regulatory approvals tDCS is a CE approved treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) in the UK, EU, Australia, and Mexico. As of 2015, tDCS has not been approved for any use by the US FDA. An FDA briefing document prepared in 2012 stated that \\"there is no regulation for therapeutic tDCS\\".

He was an able military commander who liberated the western coast of India from Portuguese rule. The high watermark of his career was the capture of Vasai fort from the Portuguese in a hard-fought battle. He was known to run strategy for the Maratha Empire and was known to plan all the battles for Bajirao. Maratha campaigns against the Portuguese A painting of Chimaji Ballal Peshwa near Parvati temple, a part of the Peshwa Memorial atop Parvati in Pune Chimaji Appa concentrated his energies towards the Western Ghats. Vasai (formerly known as Bassein) was the ultimate objective of the war, as this was the capital of the provincial government of Portugal's northern Indian Capture of Belapur Castle In 1733, the Marathas, led by Chimaji Appa, with Sardar Shankarbuwa Shinde wrested control of the Belapur Fort from the Portuguese. Sardar Jankojirao Shinde actual Great grandfather of Ranojirao Shinde and real younger brother of Dattajirao Shinde [The First] (Scindia) opened the attack from maratha side. He had made a vow that if it were to be successfully recaptured from the Portuguese, he would place a garland of beli leaves in a nearby Amruthaishwar temple, and after the victory the fort was renamed as Belapur Fort. The capture of Vasai After careful planning, Chimaji Appa led Maratha armies into the occupied territories in 1737. Chimaji's strategy was to go for the weakest link in the chain to the strongest, thereby progressively weakening the Portuguese. On 28 March 1737, Maratha forces led by Ranojirao Shinde and Shankarbuwa Shinde captured the strategic island fortress of Arnala, thus cutting off a crucial relief line to Vasai. Thane and Salsette Island were freed in 1737. In November 1738, Chimaji Appa captured the fort of Dahanu and on 20 January 1739, Mahim capitulated. This was speedily followed by the capture of the forts of Kelve/Mahim by Chengojirao shinde, Sirgão – by Ranojirao shinde, Tarapur – by Janojirao shinde, and Asserim on 13 February 1739 by Chimnajirao Peshwa self. On 28 March 1739 Portuguese lost the island and the fortress of Karanja to Raoloji Shinde's forces. Finally in February 1739, Chimaji Appa invaded Bassein Fort. He first occupied Versova fort., Dharavi and blockaded Bassein Creek. Then mines were laid at various points under the fort walls and detonated, causing a breach in the wall. As the Marathas including Ranojirao Shinde and his cousin grandfather Janojirao son of Shrimanat Changojirao poured into the fortress, the Portuguese fought on desperately and viciously, using their technically advanced weapons and artillery, they caused high casualties among the Marathas. Inch by inch the fort was secured and resistance contained in small pockets. At this stage the tower of Saint Sebastian collapsed in an explosion, and Portuguese morale plummeted. All resistance ceased immediately. On 16 May the Portuguese army surrendered. Portuguese Captain Caetano de Souza Pereira signed the surrender as most of the top army officers were already dead. Samadhi of Chimaji Appasaheb Peshwe and his wife Annapurnadevi (Who also went Sati on her husbands pyre) Chimaji was magnanimous in victory, and surviving Portuguese were given a safe passage from the city. Portuguese were given eight days to take all their movable property and move out. Accordingly, the last remnants of Portuguese army and administration pulled out of Vasai by 23 May 1739. Great maratha warrior Manajirao, alias Jankoji Shinde Son of Chengojirao Shinde [and actual father of Ranoji], killed Portuguese top official General Martinho da Sylveira, General Pedro de Mello and Lt. Colonel João Malhão. The Portuguese sources record that during the entire war with Chimaji Appa during 1737–1740, besides the Northern Province's capital Baçaim (Portuguese name for Vasai), they further lost eight cities, four chief ports, twenty fortress, two fortified hills and 340 villages. The losses amounted to nearly the whole of the Northern Provinces. To celebrate his victory and to fulfill a vow taken in front of Devi Vajreshwari, Chimaji appa had a temple built for the goddess nearby. The Vajreshwari Temple still stands there as a relic of Maratha glory. Chimaji Appa collected five large bells after he won in war against the Portuguese from Vasai Fort. He offered the bells at Bhimashankar, at Menavali near Wai in front of a Shiva Temple on the banks of the Krishna river, Banshanker temple( Pune), Omkareshwar Temple ( Pune) and Ramlinga temple Shirur. Chimaji Appa is a well known and highly respected figure within Vasai, Bhayandar, Virar, Thane and Navghar region. Konkani celebrate his victory even today on Gudi Padwa a Maharashtri new year. Appa's contribution to Agri history is carried forward through generations through classic Powada across Maharashtra. He founded and renamed many villages including Vasai now a suburb, Bhayandar now a suburb, Virar now a town, Navghar now a town, Murdha, Rai, Morva, Dongri, Gorai and many more. Chimaji Appa died in 1740. The conquest of Bassein was long cherished by the Marathas as a matter of national pride and glory. A relationship built on trust and camaraderie between Bajirao and Chimaji was the key to the meteoric rise of the Marathas during Bajirao Peshwa's reign. Family Chimaji was married to Rakhmabai (Pethe family). Rakhmabai was loving wife of Chimaji appa . They had a son Sadashivrao known popularly as Sadashivrao Bhau who led the Maratha forces in the historic Third Battle of Panipat against Ahmad Shah Durrani. Rakhmabai died shortly after Sadashivrao's birth.  In popular culture  *In the 2015 drama film Bajirao Mastani directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Chimaji Appa was portrayed by Vaibbhav Tatwawdi. *In the popular historical drama Peshwa Bajirao, which has been telecasted on Sony TV from 23 January 2017, the character of Chimaji Appa has been portrayed by the young child artist Ayaan Zubair Rehmani and the elder version is being played by actor Saurabh Gokhale.

The film, which has music scored by noted musician Yuvan Shankar Raja and cinematography handled by Arvind Krishna (cinematographer), released on 4 July 2003, winning critical acclaim and becoming a commercial success upon release, is considered as the breakthrough for Dhanush that catapulted him into the foray of lead actors in the Tamil film industry. The film was later remade in Telugu in 2004 as Nenu, in Kannada in 2009 as Ravana, in Indian Bengali in 2010 as Amanush, and in Bangladesh Bengali in 2004 as Onno Manush. The story explores the mind of a youth who is mentally and physically abused in his childhood. The lack of a mother's love haunts the protagonist throughout the film as the girl of his infatuation is killed. Becoming a psychopath, he desperately tries to woo his newly found lady love and his efforts culminate in a nail-biting cliffhanger. Plot Vinod (Dhanush), who has grown up under the care of a church father Rozario (Nagesh), is an introvert but a genius. He is forcibly sent to college by Rozario but is a complete misfit in class. Though shunned by the rest of his class, Divya (Sonia Agarwal) becomes his friend, and he gradually warms up to her. His feelings soon turn into love, but he realizes that Divya considers him as only a friend and learns that she is in love with another classmate, Aadhi (Sudeep). Divya's father is enraged on knowing about her love. He locks her up and prevents her from contacting anyone. Vinod comes and requests to meet her on the pretext of getting some old clothes for himself to wear. Pitying Vinod, her father allows him to meet Divya. Vinod escapes with Divya and convinces her that she will meet Aadhi in Ooty. Vinod has set up a secret place in Ooty for executing his plan of wooing Divya. He makes her stay with him, while convincing her by talking about Aadhi's arrival. On one such day, he reveals his miserable past, when he was made to work for paid labour after being orphaned at an early age. He revolts against the oppression one day. Promptly, he is beaten black and blue for his bravery. Moreover, he also loses his girlfriend to rapists in that place, who also kill her. After some days he kills the woman running the orphanage and also kills the rapist, helped by other children. They manage to break the place, escape from there, and seek refuge in the place of Rozario. Divya is touched by his past. Incidentally, the police and Aadhi arrive at the place. While Vinod was away to get some food, they try to explain to Divya that Vinod is a psychopath. Divya scoffs at their claims, citing his gentlemanly behaviour over the days that she has been alone with him. Vinod, learning that the police have arrived at the scene, begins to indulge in violence. He opens fire, killing a police constable. Forcing them out of their hideout, he manages to evade the police inspector and Aadhi and successfully brings Divya back to their original place of stay. Divya soon identifies the tiger in the cow's skin. Vinod pleads with her, telling Divya that all he wanted in his life was her presence, but she called him a friend and stated her inability to accept him as her partner for life. Meanwhile, Aadhi regains consciousness and comes back to attack Vinod and rescue his girlfriend. A violent fight follows, where Vinod treats Aadhi with disdain. The fight culminates with Vinod, Aadhi, and Divya teetering at the edge of a slippery cliff. While Divya clutches a tree bark tightly, Vinod and Aadhi slip out and barely manage to hold either of her hands. Divya is forced to choose between her boyfriend and friend. Aadhi's pleas notwithstanding, Divya does not have the heart to kill Vinod, who smiles wryly at Divya and lets go of her, falling to his death in the ravine.

The venture, produced by his home production, also marked the first collaboration of Selvaraghavan with cinematographer Arvind Krishna, whom he would later associate with newcomer Sonia Agarwal. Selvaraghavan had written the script for the film in the late 1990s and had first narrated the story to Dhanush in their shared bedroom at home, before asking him to play the lead role of Vinod.http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/08/20/stories/2003082000060100.htm Soundtrack For Kaadhal Kondein, director Selvaraghavan and music composer Yuvan Shankar Raja came together again after their earlier successful collaboration in Thulluvadho Ilamai (2002), for which Selvaraghavan worked as a writer. The soundtrack of Kaadhal Kondein released on 20 March 2003, featuring seven tracks with lyrics written by Pazhani Bharathi and Na. Muthukumar. The music, especially the film score, received universal critical acclaim, establishing composer Yuvan Shankar Raja as one of the \\"most sought after music directors\\" in the Tamil film industry. More than one year after the release of the film, an \\"original soundtrack\\" was released, that followed the Hollywood-style. It was said to be the first time, that an original soundtrack was released for a film in India as the soundtracks released in India do not contain any film score pieces but full songs that feature in the film itself. The OST of Kaadhal Kondein contains 20 tracks overall, which includes the seven earlier released tracks, four \\"montage\\" bit songs, that featured in the film, but not in the soundtrack, and nine pieces from the actual film score, which were titled as \\"Theme Music\\".

Gold and Judith Helfand. With a lighthearted tone, the film follows one woman's quest for an environmentally sound cladding for her parents' house in Merrick, Long Island, New York. It also investigates the many negative health effects of polyvinyl chloride in its production, use and disposal, focusing on the communities of Lake Charles and Mossville, Louisiana, and Venice, Italy. Filming for Blue Vinyl began in 1994. It was aired on HBO as part of the series America Undercover.  Synopsis  The documentary comes out of Helfand's desire to have a safer environment for her parents to live in, after she discovers that they covered their house in vinyl siding. Throughout the documentary, Helfand intends on revealing that vinyl siding creates a dangerous living environment for people living in the house covered with vinyl siding, and for the environment around them. To explore her theories, Helfand and her team visit three different locations. The first is Lake Charles, Louisiana, the home of one of the biggest PVC plants in the United States. She interviews various local residents and learns that most of them know the problems associated with the plant, but either don't see ways to fix them or don't have any desire to fix them. Helfand seems to become a bit frustrated with the lackadaisical attitude that some of the residents have in this section. Also during her time in Lake Charles, she meets some members of the Vinyl Institute, an organization that defends the interests of the vinyl industry, and representatives from the Institute initially refuse her questions about any harmful effects from PVC production. Helfand meets Elaine Ross as well, whose husband was killed as a result of working in the PVC production plant owned by Vista, and learns about her lawyer, William \\"Billy\\" Baggett, whose work in her case is starting to make a serious change towards safer plants and better regulations. After spending time in Lake Charles, Helfand and her team travel to Venice, Italy, where they meet more citizens hurt by large vinyl productions plants. The problem, they discover, is a worldwide issue. Helfand meets and interviews Dr. Caesar Maltone, a biologist whose experiments helped to create the basis for most of the lawsuits against vinyl production plants around the world. The documentary reveals that a few large vinyl production companies signed a secrecy agreement to make sure Maltone's findings stay secret from the rest of the world. The documentary focuses mainly on the Italian company EniChem, which is located in Venice and was the focus of Maltone's study. But, the vinyl producers do set certain rules and regulations on vinyl productions plants to try and avoid excessive lawsuits. For example, they declare that the limit of exposure that any given worker will have in the process of vinyl production is 1 ppm (part per million). But, after Helfand consults with Maltone again, he reveals that no limits that companies put can fully prevent exposure when production happens. Helfand returns again to Louisiana, this time to a community near Lake Charles named Mossville. This community was so hurt by the pollution from nearby vinyl production plants that their groundwater supply was affected, and the community is largely deserted. Because of this disaster, along with problems in Lake Charles, Helfand showcases the work of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which is a community organization that works with homemade air quality testers to make sure their community is held to the right environmental standards. From Mossville, Helfand travels to California to discuss some alternatives to the vinyl siding on her parents' house, and learns about many different alternatives that are used in property building in lieu of traditional vinyl siding. To end the film, she finds a safe alternative to vinyl siding by using repurposed wood, and gives her parents' house good protection from the elements, while being environmentally and economically conscious.  Background  = History = PVC or polyvinyl chloride production dates back to the 19th century but began being widely used in the 1950s when companies discovered its versatility. By the 1980s, 20 companies were producing PVC. The advancements in chemical makeup made the material ideal for construction. Its low cost, durability, and processability made it a widely used product outside of construction into markets like IT, healthcare, and transportation The market for PVC extended out of construction into beauty products like aerosol hairspray. PVC was largely deemed harmless until four workers died of angiosarcoma in a PVC production factory in Louisville, Kentucky. After this, the vinyl industry developed a standard of one part per million (1ppm) as the acceptable level during the production of PVC and also removed PVC from hairspray products (award of commendation article). The Vinyl Institute claimed that only resin workers were at risk during the production and that the new (1ppm) standard protected against that. Hefland investigates these newer concerns with the production of PVC and tries to determine whether companies like the vinyl institute were committed to protecting their consumers with these types of guidelines. = Research = Blue Vinyl teamed up with Working Films to create the My House is Your House CampaignMy House is Your House Campaign to turn the film into an organizing tool by increasing deliberate consumer advocacy and influencing industry change.Blue Vinyl and the My House is Your House Consumer Organizing Campaign, 2002–2003 The My House is Your House campaign sparked out of this documentary to continue the efforts after an attempt to inspire consumers through the film. This campaign focuses on the harmful effects of Polyvinyl Chloride production also known as \\"PVC\\" or \\"Vinyl.\\" 75% of all PVC is used in construction materials. According to this campaign, PVC plastic is considered one of the most detrimental in terms of harmful effects. During production, it emits toxic byproducts including dioxin which has been linked to many cancers, neurological damage, respiratory problems, and birth defects among others. In addition to the health risks associated with PVC production, environmentalists associated with the film suggest that dioxins released through PVC plants do not disappear but are absorbed by animals and humans. PVC is also non-recyclable and highly flammable causing complications with the life cycle of this construction product. = Proposed alternatives = The documentary communicates the issue of uninformed consumers that purchase PVC as a cheap and efficient building material. Helfand hoped the film would bring light to the lack of understanding about materials used in the majority of American's homes. After her dissatisfaction with settling with vinyl, Judith seeks alternatives for housing construction. The My House Your House Campaign served as an education and advocacy focused effort was developed after the film to educate consumers about and take action against the use and production of PVC-based products and their life cycle. Helfand and the My House is Your House campaign assessed the impact of the life cycle of PVC, the affordability of PVC versus other construction materials, and the possibilities of incorporating these into routine construction practices. They provide links to environmental organizations that are committed to offering alternatives outside of the PVC market. On the campaign's website there's a list of alternative materials that might present less consequences than vinyl. These materials include piping, siding, roofing membranes, wall coverings, and furniture.  Reception  = Accolades = It was a complete shock to everyone when Blue Vinyl had come out on DVD because it exposed the dangers of a commonly used substance. Vinyl or Polyvinyl is a not only cheap but easily attainable through your local store or hospital. A couple examples of the many things PVC is put into is computers, cellphones, cars, dashboards, and hospital iv bags. The film explains the dangers of what could happen if this substance goes near a flame considering it is highly flammable and will release toxic fumes when burned. Many of the PVC plant workers have been diagnosed with cancer because of the toxic fumes that this vinyl contains. This film compares Lake Charles to an Italian city because they have both been used as a dumping ground and thus effecting the environment. PVC is said to be not only dangerous when produced but also when disposed. The corporations are exposed for letting this substance effect the communities it is produced in and for profiting off of the people in the communities. Most construction areas use PVC because of the many ways it could be used to build a house. = Critiques = The film received scrutinyhealthybuilding.net when the DVD was released with portions missing from the original broadcast. Lori Sanzone, a woman diagnosed with angiosarcoma of liver (ASL), a type of cancer associated with vinyl exposure, had her diagnosis changed to a different disease. Also, after an out-of-court settlement, an Italian court ended a lawsuit talked about in Blue Vinyl. Counter to the accolades, many pointed out that there were inaccuracies in the original film. The Vinyl Institute president, Tim Burns, issued a statement announcing changes between the film and DVD. He noted that a star witness supporting the claim that exposure to vinyl production can cause ASL, Lori Sanzone, is missing from the DVD version. (In the original film she was pictured as someone who had developed ASL from working in the plant). Burns claims that she did not have ASL and only worked in a PVC factory for seven days. He notes this led to Sanzone's case was dismissed in January 2004. Burns also notes the misuse of the case against Italian Vinyl producers which was dismissed in court before the production of the film. This is kept in the DVD version with a title rolling with this information at the end.  See also  *Vinyl siding *Polyvinyl chloride *Louisiana Bucket Brigade  References  *Blue Vinyl. Dir.

After the Soviet ultimatum in June 1940, a new pro-Soviet government was formed, known as the People's Government. The new government dismissed the Fourth Seimas and announced elections to the People's Seimas. The elections were heavily rigged, and resulted in a chamber composed entirely of Communists and Communist sympathizers (the electorate had no choice as 79 candidates were offered to the 79 seats). The new parliament unanimously adopted a resolution proclaiming the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned for admission to the Soviet Union as a constituent republic. The Supreme Soviet of the USSR accepted the Lithuanian petition on August 3, 1940. The People's Seimas adopted a new constitution, a close copy of the 1936 Soviet Constitution, on August 25 and renamed itself to the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR. According to Lithuanian and Western sources, these events were merely a cover to create an illusion of constitutional legitimacy of the forcible Soviet occupation. When Lithuania declared its independence in 1990, it argued that it did not need to follow the process of secession from the Soviet Union outlined in the Soviet constitution. It took the line that the actions of the People's Seimas—and indeed, the entire process of annexation—violated both Lithuanian and international law, and it was merely reasserting an independence that legally still existed. According to Soviet and Russian sources, the election of the People's Seimas marked the culmination of a socialist revolution that the Lithuanian people had carried out independent of Moscow's influence. Thus, according to the Soviet line, the People's Seimas—as did legislatures elected under similar circumstances in Estonia and Latvia—represented the legitimate will of the Lithuanian people to join the Soviet Union. Background According to the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Lithuania was assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence. Almost immediately Lithuanian diplomats were invited to Moscow for negotiations. The Soviets proposed the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty: Lithuania would receive a portion of Vilnius Region in exchange for Soviet bases within Lithuania. Similar pacts were already signed with Latvia and Estonia. Finland rejected a similar proposal and the Soviets started the Winter War which delayed the occupation of the Baltic States. After the Winter War was over and Germany was winning the Battle of France, the Soviets heightened their propaganda, accusing Lithuania of abducting its soldiers from the bases in Lithuania and conspiring with Latvia and Estonia against the Soviet Union. On June 14, 1940 the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding to form a new pro-Soviet government and to allow an unspecified number of the Red Army soldiers to enter Lithuanian territory. Lithuania accepted the ultimatum and on June 15, the Red Army entered Lithuania unopposed. People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vladimir Dekanozov arrived to supervise the process of the annexation of Lithuania. President Antanas Smetona opposed the occupation, and fled the country in protest. Before his departure, he turned over his powers on an interim basis to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys, who stood next in the line of succession under the 1938 Constitution. On 16 June, Merkys announced on a national radio broadcast that he had deposed Smetona and was now president in his own right. Merkys appointed a new pro-Soviet government, headed by left-wing journalist Justas Paleckis, which later became known as the People's Government. Merkys resigned two days later at the behest of the Soviets, leaving Paleckis as acting president. Writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius became the new Prime Minister. For all intents and purposes, Lithuania had lost its independence. Lithuania's official position since 1990 has been that Merkys' usurpation of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional, since Smetona never resigned. Therefore, Lithuania contends that all subsequent actions leading up to the Soviet annexation were ipso facto void. On June 27, Paleckis dissolved the Fourth Seimas of Lithuania, citing the Constitution of 1938. Elections On July 1, the Paleckis government announced elections to a new parliament, the People's Seimas, to be held on July 14. The Communist Party of Lithuania emerged from underground with 1,500 members after the Soviet invasion. Soon afterward, the government announced the formation of the Union of the Working People of Lithuania, ostensibly a popular front. Voters were presented with a single list of candidates, including some non-Communists. No other organizations were allowed to participate. On July 11 and 12, the Soviet authorities reduced the possible points of opposition by arresting leading figures of the old regime and deporting some of them to the interior of the Soviet Union – even though Lithuania was still formally an independent state. Later elections were extended into July 15. Each voter had his or her passport stamped after voting. According to the official results, voter turnout reached 95 percents. Most of the original election records were destroyed. The remaining bits show that turnout was indeed high, but many ballots were invalid (missing, destroyed, left blank, or marked with anti-Soviet slogans). The Union list received over 99% of the votes, a total that was announced even before the polls closed—classic signs of massive election fraud. Annexation The People's Seimas met on July 21, 1940. Its sole order of business was a resolution creating the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and requesting the Soviet Union to admit Lithuania into the Union. This resolution was passed by acclamation. Twenty representatives were to deliver the declaration to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR: acting President Justas Paleckis, Minister of the Interior Mečys Gedvilas, Minister of Agriculture Matas Mickis, Minister of Education Antanas Venclova, Minister of Defence and Commander of the Army Vincas Vitkauskas, former priest and chief control inspector Liudas Adomauskas, chairman of the trade unions Motiejus Šumauskas, Communist Party activists Karolis Didžiulis-Grosmanas and Icikas Meskupas- Adomas, writers Liudas Gira and Petras Cvirka, poet Salomėja Nėris, Palanga mayor Stasė Vaineikienė, soldier Viktoras Ditkevičius, farmers Juozas Demskis and Birutė Abdulskaitė, workers Kazys and Pranas Petrauskas, Pranas Zibertas, and Marija Kutraitė. Each member of the delegation received 5,000 litas payment for their signatures, which was a substantial sum for that time. The Soviet Union approved the Lithuanian resolution on August 3, and the People's Seimas declared itself the provisional Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 9, 2011 river in Siskiyou County, California, United States. It is a tributary of the Klamath River, one of the largest rivers in California. History Historically, fur trappers called the river the Beaver River, before the Hudson's Bay Company nearly extirpated beaver from the area in the early 19th century. Scott Valley was first entered ( first Europeans) Stephen Meek, Thomas McKay, George Adolphus Duzel and 16 other Hudson's Bay trappers in 1836. In 1850 alone, Meek reportedly trapped 1,800 beaver in Scott Valley, which was then known as Beaver Valley. Meek, who had hunted all over the West, declared the Beaver Valley one of the best places he had ever seen to trap beaver and hunt game, and returned to retire there at the Josiah Doll ranch from 1871 until his death in 1889 at the age of 90. The 1850 discovery of gold during the California Gold Rush by pioneer John W. Scott at Scott Bar, downriver from Scott Valley, brought many prospectors into the area; Scott's discovery led to the naming of the valley and the river in his honor. Watershed The Scott River's watershed covers about . About two-thirds of the land is privately owned and about one-third is publicly owned. About 45 percent of the land is used for forestry, grazing for 40 percent, 13 percent for cropland and the remaining 2 percent of land is used for various purposes. Habitat and conservation Dredges that operated in the Scott Valley between 1934 and 1950 did some of the most visible damage done during the mining era. Large Yuba dredges, which also used mercury to process sand and gravel, excavated material below the river channel and flood plains and created piles of tailings more than high downstream of the town of Callahan. In Sugar Creek, a Scott River tributary that is usually ephemeral, local landowner Betsy Stapleton worked with Michael Pollock of NOAA to create \\"beaver dam analogues\\" by driving posts into the creekbed to attract beavers to build dams. Now Stapleton's reach on Sugar Creek has perennial beaver ponds while the neighboring creeks run dry in summer and fall. Pollock's method had been used successfully in Bridge Creek, Oregon where the subsequent increase in beaver dams led to a dramatic increase in rainbow trout abundance.

In May 2016, it merged with Bay of Plenty Polytechnic to form Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology. Regional campuses existed in Taupo, Tokoroa and Whakatane, and formerly Turangi and Kawerau. These were backed by a variety of specialist campuses and buildings, such as the Waipa Campus just south of Rotorua and the newly established offerings available from Waiariki in the Tauranga suburb of Windermere. Waiariki was divided into three faculties, which offered masters, graduate, postgraduate and degree qualifications, as well as diplomas and certificates in several subject areas. They were the Faculty of Applied Technology and Primary Industries - Te Kura Takawāo, the Faculty of Business, Information Technology and Creative Arts - Te Kura Taki, and Te Pākaro Ihenga: Faculty of Health, Education and Humanities. Qualification subject areas included nursing, teaching, social work, art, sustainability, Māori, forestry, business, computing, tourism and hospitality. These were backed by an equally diverse range of trade-based qualifications, in areas such as engineering, agriculture, horticulture, fashion, carpentry and hairdressing.  Tangatarua Marae  Waiariki has an on-site marae named Tangatarua, which translates as \\"two peoples\\" to reflect their bicultural nature. Tangatarua Marae was officially opened on 5 October 1996 and is named after a Te Arawa ancestor, Ihenga, who lived on the land where the Mokoia Campus is today.  Academies  The Waiariki Academy of Sport offered talented athletes the opportunity to prioritise their sporting careers while gaining a tertiary education. Similarly, the Waiariki Academy of Singing and Music supported talented young singers and musicians to reach their musical goals while studying. Waiariki also offered teenagers interested in trade areas the Bay of Plenty Trades Academy, which allowed secondary students to get a taste of trade subjects and tertiary life while still at high-school.  History  Waiariki Community College was born in 1976, after the Rotorua Boys’ High School Technical Institute Division was merged with the Rotorua Girls' High School Business College to form a Senior Technical Division under the Rotorua High Schools' Board of Governors. Building on the Mokoia Drive site commenced that year, and the Waiariki Community College was opened two years later on 1 April 1978. Tokoroa's 'outpost' opened in 1973, and subsequently became Waiariki's first regional campus in 1978. By the time Waiariki Community College changed its name to Waiariki Polytechnic in 1987, it was the largest polytechnic outside of the main city centres. The first two degree-level qualifications in tourism management and nursing were launched in 1995, and three years later, the name finally changed to Waiariki Institute of Technology.

Overview of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, Fact Sheet 1. Washington, DC (January) Toward the end of that period, CCSP issued 21 separate climate assessment reports that addressed climate observations, changes in the atmosphere, expected climate change, impacts and adaptation, and risk management issues. Shortly after President Obama took office, the program's name was changed to U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) which was also the program's name before 2002. Nevertheless, the Obama Administration generally embraced the CCSP products as sound science providing a basis for climate policy.See Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States. Because those reports were mostly issued after the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and in some cases focused specifically on the United States, they were generally viewed within the United States as having an importance and scientific credibility comparable to the IPCC assessments for the first few years of the Obama Administration.For example, see Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act: Technical Support Document 2009.

Changes in Earth's orbit alone would have increased summer sea ice. * Sustained warming of at least 2 to 7 °C would be likely to eventually melt the entire Greenland ice sheet, which would raise sea level by several meters. * The past tells us that when thresholds in the climate system are crossed, climate change can be very large and very fast. No one knows whether human activities will trigger such events in the coming decades and centuries.

Randall Dole, Martin Hoerling, and Siegfried Schubert (editors). National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, NC, 156 pp. in December 2008. According to the report, from 1951 to 2006 the yearly average temperature for North America increased by 1.6° Fahrenheit, with virtually all of the warmingsince 1970. During this period, the average temperature has warmed approximately 3.6 °F over Alaska, the Yukon Territories, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, but no significant warming occurred in the southern United States or eastern Canada. More than half of the warming of North America is likely (more than 66 percent chance) to have resulted from human activity. There is less evidence that precipitation is changing. The report found no significant trend in North American precipitation since 1951, although there have been substantial changes from year to year and even decade to decade. Moreover, it is unlikely that a fundamental change has occurred in either how often or where severe droughts have occurred over the continental United States during the past half-century. Nevertheless, drought impacts have likely become more severe in recent decades. It is likely that the impacts have been more severe because the recent droughts have lasted a few years, and because warmer temperatures have created stresses in plants, which make them more vulnerable. =Changes in the atmosphere= Scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentrations (SAP 2.1) The US Department of Energy released the second SAP in July 2007, entitled Scenarios of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Atmospheric Concentrations and Review of Integrated Scenario Development and Application.CCSP SAP 2.1 web page Scenarios of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Atmospheric Concentrations and Review of Integrated Scenario Development and Application This two-volume report explored emission scenarios that could stabilize the net effect of greenhouse gases at four different levels.

Coastal sensitivity to sea level rise (SAP 4.1) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released Coastal Sensitivity to Sea-Level Rise: A Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region CCSP 2009 . Coastal Sensitivity to Sea Level Rise. James G. Titus (convening lead author). Washington, DC: US Environmental Protection Agency. 320 pp (SAP 4.1) on January 16, 2009. According to the report's abstract, rising sea level can inundate low areas and increase flooding, coastal erosion, wetland loss, and saltwater intrusion into estuaries and freshwater aquifers. Much of the United States consists of coastal environments and landforms such as barrier islands and wetlands that will respond to sea-level rise by changing shape, size, or position. The combined effects of sea-level rise and other climate change factors such as storms may cause rapid and irreversible coastal change. Coastal communities and property owners have responded to coastal hazards by erecting shore protection structures, elevating land and buildings, or relocating inland. Accelerated sea-level rise would increase the costs and environmental impacts of these responses. Preparing for sea-level rise can be justified in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared to the cost of reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long- lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been the exception rather than the rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises. A committee set up under the Federal Advisory Committee Act monitored the progress of SAP 4.1, and questioned several aspects of the final report. The original plan included maps and estimates of wetland loss from a then-ongoing EPA mapping study conducted by James G. Titus, who was also a lead author of SAP 4.1. Early drafts included the maps and results, but the final draft did not. Experts and environmental organizations objected to the deletions. The federal advisory committee also took issue with the maps' removal from SAP 4.1 and recommended that EPA publish the mapping study.Report of the Coastal Elevations and Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee Report to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, October 2008. EPA later confirmed that EPA management had altered the report and suppressed the mapping study, although it declined to explain why. Thresholds in ecosystems (SAP 4.2) USGS released Thresholds of Climate Change in Ecosystems CCSP, 2009 Thresholds of Climate Change in Ecosystems (Fagre D.B., and C.W. Charles, lead authors) U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC. 156 pp. (SAP 4.2) on January 16, 2009. A key premise of the report was that an ecological threshold is the point at which there is an abrupt change in an ecosystem that produces large, persistent and potentially irreversible changes. The report concluded that slight changes in climate may trigger major abrupt ecosystem responses that are not easily reversible. Some of these responses, including insect outbreaks, wildfire, and forest dieback, may adversely affect people as well as ecosystems and their plants and animals. One of the greatest concerns is that once an ecological threshold is crossed, the ecosystem in question will most likely not return to its previous state. The report also emphasized that human actions may increase an ecosystem's potential for crossing ecological thresholds. For example, additional human use of water in a watershed experiencing drought could trigger basic changes in aquatic life that may not be reversible. Ecosystems that already face stressors other than climate change, will almost certainly reach their threshold for abrupt change sooner. Effects on agriculture, land resources, water resources, and biodiversity (SAP 4.3) The United States Department of Agriculture released The Effects of Climate Change on Agriculture, Land Resources, Water Resources, and BiodiversityCCSP 2008. The Effects of Climate Change on Agriculture, Land Resources, Water Resources, and Biodiversity (Peter Backlund, Anthony Janetos, and David Schimel, convening lead authors) U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC. 362 pp (SAP 4.3) in May 2008. The executive summary includes the following findings. Agriculture * Life cycle of grain and oilseed crops will likely progress more rapidly; but with rising temperatures and variable rainfall, crops will begin to experience failure, especially if precipitation lessens or becomes more variable. * Climate change is leading to a northward migration of cropland weeds, and range and pasture plant species, which affects crops, grazing land, and livestock operations. * Higher temperatures will very likely reduce livestock production during the summer season. Land resources * Climate change has likely increased the size and number of forest fires, insect outbreaks and tree mortality in the Interior West (Colorado, the Great Basin), Southwest and Alaska * In arid lands, changes in temperature and precipitation will very likely decrease the vegetation cover that protects the ground surface from wind and erosion. * Rising CO2 will very likely increase photosynthesis for forests, but this increase will likely only enhance wood production in young forests on fertile soils. Water resources * Runoff may increase in eastern regions, gradually transitioning to little change in the Missouri and lower Mississippi, to substantial decreases in the interior of the west (Colorado and Great Basin). * Stream temperatures are likely to increase, which will harm aquatic ecosystems. * Mountain snowpack is declining and melting earlier in the spring across much of the western United States. Biodiversity * The rapid rate of warming in the Arctic is dramatically reducing snow and ice cover that provide denning and forage habitat for polar bears. * Corals in many tropical regions are experiencing substantial mortality from increasing water temperatures, increasing storm intensity, and a reduction in pH. Adaptation options for climate-sensitive ecosystems and resources (SAP 4.4) EPA released Preliminary Review of Adaptation Options for Climate- Sensitive Ecosystems and ResourcesCCSP, 2008 Preliminary review of adaptation options for climate-sensitive ecosystems and resources. Susan H. Julius and Jordan M. West (editors). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC. 873 pp (SAP 4.3) in May 2008. The study focuses on national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, wild and scenic rivers, national estuaries, and marine protected areas, all of which are protected by the federal government. The report analyzed how to meet existing management goals set for each protected area to understand what strategies will increase the resilience of each ecosystem. EPA concluded that climate change can increase the impact of traditional stressors (such as pollution or habitat destruction) on ecosystems, and that many existing best management practices to reduce these stressors can also be applied to reduce the impacts of climate change. For example, current efforts to reverse habitat destruction by restoring vegetation along streams also increase ecosystem resilience to climate change impacts, such as greater amounts of pollutants and sediments from more intense rainfall. EPA also concluded that the nation's ability to adapt to climate change will depend on a variety of factors including recognizing the barriers to implementing new strategies, expanding collaboration among ecosystem managers, creatively re-examining program goals and authorities, and being flexible in setting priorities and managing for change. Effects of Climate Change on Energy Production and Use (SAP 4.5) DOE released Effects of Climate Change on Energy Production and Use in the United StatesCCSP, 2007 . Effects of Climate Change on Energy Production and Use in the United States. Thomas J. Wilbanks et al. (editors). Department of Energy, Office of Biological & Environmental Research, Washington, DC. 160 pp. (SAP 4.5) in October 2007. The report concludes that the possible impacts of climate change on energy production are important enough to start considering how to adapt. The report's executive summary summarized the report with three questions and answers: * How might climate change affect energy consumption in the United States? The research evidence is relatively clear that climate warming will mean reductions in total U.S. heating requirements and increases in total cooling requirements for buildings. These changes will vary by region and by season, but they will affect household and business energy costs and their demands on energy supply institutions. In general, the changes imply increased demands for electricity, which supplies virtually all cooling energy services but only some heating services. Other effects on energy consumption are less clear. * How might climate change affect energy production and supply in the United States? The research evidence about effects is not as strong as for energy consumption, but climate change could affect energy production and supply (a) if extreme weather events become more intense, (b) where regions dependent on water supplies for hydropower and/or thermal power plant cooling face reductions in water supplies, (c) where temperature increases decrease overall thermoelectric power generation efficiencies, and (d) where changed conditions affect facility siting decisions. Most effects are likely to be modest except for possible regional effects of extreme weather events and water shortages. * How might climate change have other effects that indirectly shape energy production and consumption in the United States? The research evidence about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible effects of climate change policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is likely to affect risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, and it is very likely to have some effects on energy technology R&D; investments and energy resource and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn affect U.S. energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric energy markets, and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.

J.L. Gamble (editor). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC. 214 pp (SAP 4.6) in July 2008. The report was directed by Janet L. Gamble of EPA and written by 28 authors. According to EPA,Environmental Protection Agency 2008 Findings of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.6] Washington, DC. 2 pp. some of the key conclusions of this report are: * It is very likely that heat- related illnesses and deaths will increase over coming decades. * An increase in ozone could cause or exacerbate heart and lung diseases. * Several food and water-borne diseases are likely to be transmitted among susceptible populations, although climate will seldom be the only factor. * The very young and old, the poor, those with health problems and disabilities, and certain occupational groups are at greater risk. * The U.S. is better prepared than most developing countries to respond to public health impacts from climate change. * The most vulnerable areas in the United States are likely to be in Alaska, coastal and river basins susceptible to flooding, and arid areas where water scarcity is a pressing issue, and areas where economic bases are climate-sensitive. * Populations are moving toward those areas that are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of climate change. * The U.S. has a well-developed public health infrastructure and environmental regulatory program to protect our air and water. If these are maintained, the U.S. can respond to many of the effects of climate change, moderating their impact. The report was formally reviewed by an independent panel set up in compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This FACA panel's report gave a generally favorable review while providing many specific areas where improvements were needed. The advisory committee's greatest concern was that the report tried so hard to be evenhanded and not overstate what we know, that it came close to leaving the impression that we know little in cases where a lot is known. EPA revised the report to satisfy those concerns and published a response to each of the comments.Response to Comments of the Human Impacts of Climate Change Advisory Committee. Climate Change Science Program. April 2008 While not taking issue with the report's findings, the Government Accountability Project complained that EPA delayed releasing the report three months so that its results could be excluded from a regulatory finding about whether greenhouse gases threaten public health.Feds: Climate change to cause 'irreversible' health risks, Dan Vergano, USA Today, July 18, 2008 Impacts on transport and infrastructure (SAP 4.7) The United States Department of Transportation released Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Transportation Systems and Infrastructure—Gulf Coast StudyCCSP, 2008 Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on Transportation Systems and Infrastructure: Gulf Coast Study, Phase I. M. J. Savonis, V.R. Burkett, and J.R. Potter (editors). Department of Transportation, Washington, DC. 445 pp. (SAP 4.7) in March 2008. The report was prepared by Michael Savonis of the Federal Highway Administration, Joanne Potter (a consultant to DOT), and Virginia Burkett of USGS. The premise of SAP 4.7 was that climate is changing. Sea levels in the Gulf of Mexico are likely to rise by two to four feet over the next 50 to 100 years from the combination of climate-induced warming and land subsidence. Tropical storms are anticipated to increase in intensity and the number of heavy precipitation events is expected to increase, raising prospects of flooding and structural damage. And the number of very hot days (i.e., >90 °F) could rise by 50%. The report concluded that the expected impacts of these climate effects on transportation are striking. A significant portion of the region's road, rail, and port network is at risk of permanent flooding if sea levels rise by four feet. This includes more than 2,400 miles (27%) of the major roads, 9% of the rail lines, and 72% of the ports. More than half (64% of interstates; 57% of arterials) of the area's major highways, almost half of the rail miles, 29 airports, and virtually all of the ports are subject to temporary flooding and damage due to increased storm intensity. The increase in daily high temperatures could increase wear on asphalt and the potential for rail buckling. Construction costs are likely to increase because of restrictions on workers on days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Transportation planners can employ climate data to draw meaningful conclusions about the future. In fact, the Gulf Coast Study recommends that transportation decision makers in the Gulf Coast should begin immediately to assess climate impacts in the development of transportation investment strategies. The study also found, however, that transportation planners need new methodological tools to address the longer time frames, complexities and uncertainties that are inherent in projections of climate phenomena. Such methods are likely to be based on probability and statistics (i.e., risk assessment techniques) as much as on engineering and material science. =Using information to manage risks= Three SAP's were prepared to further CCSP's Goal 5 * NASA released \\"Uses and Limitations of Observations, Data, Forecasts, and Other Projections in Decision Support for Selected Sectors and Regions.\\"CCSP 2008 Uses and Limitations of Observations, Data, Forecasts, and Other Projections in Decision Support for Selected Sectors and Regions.

Shortly thereafter, a team of authors synthesized key findings from the SAP's. In June 2009, CCSP changed its name to United States Global Change Research Program and released the unified synthesis report, entitled Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States .United States Global Change Research Program. 2009. Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States. Washington, DC 188 pp The report had ten key findings which became the bedrock of the Obama Administration's view of the impacts of climate change. # Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced. Global temperature has increased over the past 50 years. This observed increase is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. # Climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow. Climate-related changes are already observed in the United States and its coastal waters. These include increases in heavy downpours, rising temperature and sea level, rapidly retreating glaciers, thawing permafrost, lengthening growing seasons, lengthening ice-free seasons in the ocean and on lakes and rivers, earlier snowmelt, and alterations in river flows. These changes are projected to grow. # Widespread climate-related impacts are occurring now and are expected to increase. Climate changes are already affecting water, energy, transportation, agriculture, ecosystems, and health. These impacts are different from region to region and will grow under projected climate change. # Climate change will stress water resources. Water is an issue in every region, but the nature of the potential impacts varies. Drought, related to reduced precipitation, increased evaporation, and increased water loss from plants, is an important issue in many regions, especially in the West. Floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most regions. Declines in mountain snowpack are important in the West and Alaska where snowpack provides vital natural water storage. # Crop and livestock production will be increasingly challenged. Many crops show positive responses to elevated responses to carbon dioxide. However, increased heat, pests, water stress, diseases, and weather extremes will pose adaptation challenges for crop and livestock production. # Coastal areas are at increasing risk from sea-level rise and storm surge. Sea-level rise and storm surge place many U.S. coastal areas at increasing risk of erosion and flooding, especially along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Pacific Islands, and parts of Alaska. Energy and transportation infrastructure and other property in coastal areas are very likely to be adversely affected. # Risks to human health will increase. Health impacts of climate change are related to heat stress, waterborne diseases, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents. Robust public health infrastructure can reduce the potential for negative impacts. # Climate change will interact with many social and environmental stresses. Climate change will combine with pollution, population growth, overuse of resources, urbanization, and other social, economic, and environmental stresses to create larger impacts than from any of these factors alone. # Thresholds will be crossed, leading to large changes in climate and ecosystems. There are a variety of thresholds in the climate system and ecosystems. These thresholds determine, for example, the presence of sea ice and permafrost, and the survival of species, from fish to insect pests, with implications for society. With further climate change, the crossing of additional thresholds is expected. # Future climate change and its impacts depend on choices made today. The amount and rate of future climate change depend primarily on current and future human-caused emissions of heat-trapping gases and airborne particles. Responses involve reducing emissions to limit future warming, and adapting to the changes that are unavoidable. The organization The CCSP was known as US Global Change Research Program until 2002, as authorized by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The Bush Administration changed its name to Climate Change Science Program as part of its U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative. The Administration envisioned \\"a nation and the global community empowered with the science-based knowledge to manage the risks and opportunities of change in the climate and related environmental systems.\\" President Bush reestablished priorities for climate change research to focus on scientific information that can be developed within 2 to 5 years to assist evaluation of strategies to address global change risks.Transcript of 11 June 2001 Presidential Rose Garden speech, White House web site One the CCSP's cornerstones was the creation of 21 Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs)CCSP Information on Synthesis and Assessment Products web page to provide information to help policymakers and the public make better decisions. =Participants= The following is a list of participating agencies. * Agency for International Development * United States Department of Agriculture * Department of Commerce: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Institute of Standards and Technology * United States Department of Defense * United States Department of Energy * Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health * United States Department of State * Dept. of Transportation * United States Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey * U.S. Environmental Protection Agency * National Aeronautics & Space Administration * National Science Foundation * Smithsonian Institution The CCSP was guided by a committee of senior representatives from each of these departments and agencies, known as the CCSP Principals. The CCSP was also overseen by the Interagency Working Group on Climate Change Science and Technology.An organizational chart may be found at this link.Climate Change Science Program Org Chart (The committee of CCSP Principals was essentially synonymous with the Subcommittee on Global Change Research of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources under the National Science and Technology Council in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.) Specific program activities were coordinated through Interagency Working Groups. A coordination office facilitated the activities of the Principals and IWGs. That office as well as the IWG's continued to operate when the CCSP became the USGCRP. =Directors= * James R. MahoneyBiographical info for James R. Mahoney from CCSP web site served as the first director of the CCSP and Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere from April 2002 to March 2006. * William J. BrennanBiographical info for William J. Brennan from NOAA web site became Acting Director of CCSP in June 2006.Press release of 19 June 2006 from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Brennan remained as the acting director until June 2008 when he was confirmed as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and thereby became the director. (Jane C. Luxton of Virginia had been nominated by President Bush in September 2006 for the position, but her nomination was later withdrawn.Concerns raised about NOAA deputy administrator nominee stall confirmation process 6 December 2006) * Jack A. Kaye became Acting Director of CCSP upon Brennan's retirement from NOAA in January 2009. =Reviews and criticism= The Climate Change Science Program operated during an administration that believed that continued scientific investigation was necessary before policies should be implemented. The CCSP faced the challenge of navigating the narrow path between administration officials who were sceptical of the general scientific consensus about greenhouse gases,, and scientific critics who were skeptical about almost everything that the administration did related to climate change.E.g. James E. Hansen and Joseph Romm. As a result, the CCSP was under more scrutiny than most federal scientific coordination programs. The National Research Council (NRC) reviewed CCSP several times. The NRC's 2004 reviewImplementing Climate and Global Change Research: A Review of the Final U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, 2004 concluded that \\"the Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program articulates a guiding vision, is appropriately ambitious, and is broad in scope\\" and \\"the CCSP should implement the activities described in the strategic plan with urgency.\\" The NRC also recommended that CCSP should expand its traditional focus on atmospheric sciences to better understand the impacts, adaptation, and the human dimension of climate change. More focus on helping decision makers was necessary, it concluded. A 2007 NRC reviewEvaluating Progress of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program: Methods and Preliminary Results, 2007 was more critical. \\"Discovery science and understanding of the climate system are proceeding well, but use of that knowledge to support decision making and to manage risks and opportunities of climate change is proceeding slowly.\\" The NRC was particularly critical of the program's failure to engage stakeholders or advance scientific understanding of the impacts of climate change on human well-being. Looking to the future of the program, a 2008 NRC reportRestructuring Federal Climate Research to Meet the Challenges of Climate Change put forward a set of research recommendations very similar to that embodied in the CCSP Strategic Plan revision of 2008. The Climate Change Scientific Program was occasionally criticized for the alleged suppression of scientific information. In March 2005, Rick S. Piltz resigned from CCSP charging political interference with scientific reports: \\"I believe ...that the administration … has acted to impede forthright communication of the state of climate science and its implications for society.\\" Piltz charged that the Bush Administration had suppressed the previous National Assessment on Climate Change, by systematically deleting references to the report from government scientific documents.Lowball Warming Chris Mooney, American Prospect, June 20, 2005 Piltz later complained about political tinkering with the timing of SAP 4.6, and suppression of sea level rise mapping studies associated with SAP 4.1.Feds: Climate change to cause 'irreversible' health risks, Rick Piltz and Anne Polansky, Climate Science Watch, June 10, 2009 See also * Effects of global warming * National Assessment on Climate Change Notes External links * CCSP's archived website * U.S. Global Change Research Program Climate change organizations based in the United States Reports of the United States government Environmental policy in the United States ","title":"Climate Change Science Program"},{"id":"5004888","text":"Eugene!

It features a space flight simulator game and action game elements with an emphasis on strategy and exploration. The box describes the title as an \\"Interstellar Action and Adventure\\" game. The game features space exploration, trade, combat and diplomacy in the same vein as 4X s such as Master of Orion. Lightspeed, unlike the popular series of turn-based strategy games, plays out in real-time. A sequel, entitled Hyperspeed, was released by MicroProse in 1991. It was nearly identical to Lightspeed, except that it included two additional star clusters for veterans of the first game. Plot The player must help recolonize the human race after the Earth's habitability is critically reduced by an ecological catastrophe. The entire human race is being housed in huge Conestoga-class colony ships, which are waiting for the player to secure at least one planet with an Earth-like environment and to also acquire enough material resources to ensure that the colony or colonies in question can build a fledgling industrial base as soon as possible. The player is allowed limited time to accomplish this goal. In addition, the player must contend with the alien races living in the area that the player is exploring. The mission's success requires diplomacy to acquire allies and the elimination of races that may be potentially hostile to humanity. The player may also deem it necessary to destroy a friendly race in order to secure enough resources to successfully complete the objectives. Gameplay Spaceflight is similar in style to the Wing Commander or X-Wing titles. Most races initially adopt a neutral stance towards the player, unless they ambush the player in between star systems. The player can then choose to attack or hold their fire, which can influence future relations with that species. The player may also choose to launch an unguided probe to initiate communications with neutral or friendly species. The player-controllable vehicles consist of the main Trailblazer-class cruiser (top left screenshot on box back) and small spacecraft chassis that can be quickly reconfigured for three different roles (that of a space superiority fighter, a powerful self-guided kamikaze missile with poor maneuverability or a weak homing missile with excellent maneuverability). The player can also launch an escape pod when their Trailblazer is hopelessly crippled. Main viewscreen of Trailblazer ship. L/R displays show engineering status and engine speed/fuel. Radar lower right, current target lower left In addition, the Trailblazer is also equipped with a fast moving turret with which to shoot down lightly armored fighter craft. While this weapon (along with the weapons equipped on a fighter-variant chassis) cannot penetrate capital ship armor, the Trailblazer is also equipped with a powerful front-mounted main gun to deal with larger threats. Guided missiles and kamikaze craft can also damage capital ships. Some aliens are equipped with shield generators that can negate main gun attacks. However, these generators are vulnerable to fighter and turret fire, as they are attached to the exterior of the ship. The shield component, along with certain weapon turrets, can be targeted by precision fire - a revolutionary feature for the time. This also ensures that no one weapon system becomes redundant at any point during the course of a game. As a gameplay element, the Trailblazer cruiser can only be crippled but not destroyed. The ship also contains a view the ship's engine room, which allows the player to enhance the ship's performance by upgrading or replacing the ship's components. The engine room is split into various areas including the Spindrive FTL engine, main cannon, sublight engine, turret, and deflector shielding. These components can be destroyed in battle or by the use of the Emergency Spindrive function in order to retreat from battle and head to a safer star system to recoup and repair. If the Spindrive is running without additional components its fuel efficiency could drop to the point that it could become impossible to reach a friendly base to re-equip without running out of fuel. In this situation, the player would be forced to use the escape pod and return to main base for a replacement Trailblazer. This however would cost precious mission time. The game gives the player the option to choose one of two star clusters in which to play in. The Hyades cluster is the easier of the two, while the Cerberus cluster offers a challenge for expert players. One can also engage in practice ship-to-ship combat from the main menu, or can elect to view a 3D gallery of some the ships in the game. The game featured groundbreaking polygonal 3D graphics for its time, running at 320x200 256-color VGA resolution and quality if played on capable hardware. Reception In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, Computer Gaming World gave Lightspeed one-plus stars out of five. A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game one star, describing it as \\"The lamentable predecessor to Hyperspeed\\". In 1996 the magazine ranked Lightspeed as the 46th worst game of all time, calling it \\"more repetitive than 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' with no payoff.\\" Sequel References External links * *Hyperspeed Base * 1990 video games DOS games DOS-only games MicroProse games Space trading and combat simulators Space colonization Video games developed in the United States Video games scored by Jeff Briggs ","title":"Lightspeed (video game)"},{"id":"5004907","text":"Love Is Like a Butterfly is the fourteenth solo studio album by Dolly Parton. It was released on September 16, 1974, by RCA Victor. The title track was the third consecutive single to reach #1 on the U.S. country charts for Parton. For the few years before her pop chart success, \\"Butterfly\\" was considered Parton's signature song and was used as the theme song for her 1976 syndicated music series Dolly!. The album peaked at # 7 on the country albums charts. The album was rereleased on iTunes in March 2014 the same day as her 2014 album Blue Smoke was made available for pre-order. Critical reception In a positive review of the album, Billboard said, \\"Beginning with her beautiful hit single, Miss Parton sings a variety of songs which demonstrate her stature in this business. It's an outstanding album, full of great songs, most of which she wrote herself, and covering a great many subjects. Some are ballads, some up-tempo, and she handles everything with grace.\\" The review noted \\"If I Could Cross Your Mind\\", \\"Gettin' Happy\\", and \\"Once Upon a Memory\\" as the best tracks on the album. The review concluded with a note to record dealers, saying that the album has \\"an outstanding cover, which merits prominent display.\\" Another positive review of the album from Cashbox said, \\"Whether with Porter or by herself the inimitable songbird Dolly Parton will have an avid following [in] whatever she chooses to do or whomever she chooses to sing with.

It was founded as \\"Matsunk\\" by Swedish settlers in 1710. The name was changed to Swedeland sometime in the late 19th century. History Situated along the Schuylkill River and the Matsunk creek the Swedish villages was composed of about 19 homes. After the conquering of the Swedish colony by the Dutch, followed by English control, in 1664, a third generation settler with the New Sweden Colony named Peter Yocum the Third (1678-1753) established Swedeland. William Penn offered the Swedish and Finnish colonists land from his grant in this Upper Merion area. By the mid-19th century Abraham Supplee operated a factory producing Kentucky Jean, employing some 25 hands. The extensive works of the Swede Iron Company were also here, consisting of two large furnaces and a rail road leading from the Iron ore mines to the Schuylkill River. The land in the vicinity Swedeland/Matsunk was known for its fertile soil, limestone and Iron ore quarries. The Alan Wood Steel Company built a massive steel Plant and Coking Facility in Swedeland in 1919 this brought forth a need for additional housing. Alan Wood Steel operated into the early 1980s. The Swedeland Volunteer Fire Company was formed in 1920 and continues to protect the citizens of Upper Merion and nearby communities. Swedeland has continued its industrial heritage and is surrounded by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, chemical manufacturer Lonza, the Renaissance Business Park and The Philadelphia Newspapers Incorporated Complex.

Throughout his career, he has written music for many major TV sports events such as the Super Bowl, NCAA finals, The Masters, Olympics, NFL Today, US Open, and many more. Biography As a member of the trio of Cotton, Lloyd & Christian, put together by Mike Curb in the early 1970s, he enjoyed two hits on the Billboard adult contemporary chart on 20th Century Records. The group performed on Dick Clark's American Bandstand and Midnight Special. As a solo artist he performed on The Merv Griffin Show, Solid Gold, and was a judge on Star Search. Christian also played guitar with Chet Atkins, Jerry Reed, and the Wayne Newton band. As a record producer, he is best known for starting Amy Grant's music career by signing her at age 16 to his production company, and calling Myrrh Records executive Stan Moser, to advise he was making an album with Grant as part of a long-term production agreement Christian had signed with Myrrh Records. Christian produced her first album and acted as executive producer for her second, handing over production duties to his college friend Brown Bannister. He owned her songs until 1997 when they were sold to Gaylord Entertainment. He has produced the Pointer Sisters, Patti Austin, Al Jarreau, Natalie Cole, Amy Grant, Dallas Cowboys, B J Thomas, Dan Peek, B W Stevenson, Debby Boone, Steve Archer, Bill Gaither, Marilyn McCoo, Eric Champion, Ali Lohan, Pat Boone, and over 100 other albums. As the first artist signed to Boardwalk Records owned by Neil Bogart, with Bob Gaudio (Four Seasons) producing, he recorded \\"I Want You, I Need You,\\" which peaked at No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1981 and reached the No. 8 on Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart. \\"I Want You, I Need You\\" was a number one song in some countries outside the US. Cheryl Ladd sings back-up on the song along with many other artists on the album including Christopher Cross, Nigel Olsson, Frankie Valli, Dann Huff, Tommy Funderburk, Bill Champlin, Paul Jackson, Amy Holland, and Robbie Patton. Other artists on Boardwalk were Ringo Starr, Joan Jett, Mike Love (Beach Boys), and Night Ranger. Robert Kardashian (the Kardashians' father) was his best friend, manager and was responsible for Chris signing with Boardwalk Records. A second hit, a medley of the 1968 Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell Motown songs \\"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\\" and \\"You're All I Need to Get By\\" sung with Amy Holland, hit No. 21 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 88 on the Hot 100 in 1982. In 1981, Christian launched his own label Home Sweet Home Records. On that label he signed and produced albums for White Heart, Steve Archer, Mark Heard, Dan Peek, B.J. Thomas, Eric Champion, Rick Riso, Luke Garrett, Marilyn McCoo and others. In 1992, he founded HSH Educational Media with his brother Brad. He executive produced and wrote the music for the children's series Gerbert, which aired on PBS and what is now ABC Family for over 10 years.

It was used for passenger trains from 1849 to 1941. It was rebuilt in 1903.  History  Converting the gauge, 21 May 1892 The South Devon Railway originally planned to bring its broad gauge railway from Exeter St Davids to the Eldad area of Plymouth, terminating on a hill above Stonehouse Pool. In the event, it was redesigned to end at a station situated between Union Street and Millbay itself. The railway reached a temporary station at Laira on the eastern outskirts of Plymouth on 5 May 1848 and was extended to Millbay on 2 April 1849. At this time the station was just known as Plymouth as no other stations existed in the town. The station became known as \\"Plymouth Millbay\\" after other stations were opened in the town in 1876-7 at Mutley and North Road. A separate ticket platform was erected just outside the station in 1851 and was used until 1896. This enabled all tickets to be checked while the train paused outside the station and the opportunity was often taken for the engine to be detached and sent to the engine shed at this time and the train was then propelled into the platforms by a pilot engine. The station was expanded ready for the opening of the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859 and the South Devon and Tavistock Railway on 22 June 1859. The railway encouraged the private venture of the Plymouth Hotel Company to open the Duke of Cornwall Hotel opposite the station in 1862. The South Devon Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR) on 1 February 1876. The lines were converted to standard gauge on 21 May 1892, although standard gauge goods trains were working to the docks from 1878 over mixed gauge tracks. The station was extensively rebuilt in 1900-03 when the old wooden buildings were replaced by a new stone terminus. The station was closed to passengers on 23 April 1941 after bombs destroyed the nearby goods depot; the passenger station being used thereafter only for goods traffic and access to the carriage sheds. All traffic ceased from 14 December 1969 except for goods trains running through to the docks which continued until 30 June 1971. The site is now occupied by the Plymouth Pavilions leisure complex. Two granite gate posts (still showing traces of bomb or enemy aeroplane cannon damage from the Plymouth blitz) outside the Millbay Road entrance are all that is left of the station. An old railway goods shed on the docks branch still stands in what used to be Washington Place. Description When first opened, the platforms were covered by a large wooden roof but more conventional canopies were provided when the station was redesigned in 1900-03. Outside the station was the South Devon Railway headquarters building on the east side of the forecourt and opposite was the independent Duke of Cornwall Hotel which accommodated passengers for the trains and ships. The line from Millbay docks crossed Millbay Road on a level crossing and then climbed up a gradient between the main station and the goods shed. Alongside the level crossing was a bridge that carried some of the sidings of the goods depot. The station was built at the higher level on the back of the hill that forms Plymouth Hoe. It was partly on a viaduct, the arches of which were rented out to local businesses and, later, used as a garage for local railway buses. Trains waiting to depart faced north-eastwards but, crossing Union Street on an iron bridge, the line swung northwards. It then passed a complex of carriage and engine sheds before reaching Cornwall Junction near the bridge carrying Five Fields Lane (now North Road West), where the line to Penzance diverged to the north-west and that to London turned to the east.  Millbay Docks  The Plymouth Great Western Docks were constructed, as was the railway, under the supervision of Isambard Kingdom Brunel but they were owned by an independent company in which the railway invested. The inner basin was opened in 1857 but before the end of the year a gale had caused extensive damage which led to financial trouble which caused the South Devon Railway to acquire an increasing share in the company until the railway took full control in 1874. A siding had been laid into the docks in 1850 which crossed Millbay Road on a level crossing and was worked by horses; South Devon Railway 0-4-0 locomotives operated in the docks from 1873. Extensions were laid to the West Wharf and Graving Dock in the late 1870s and, from 18 June 1878 a third rail was added to allow access for London and South Western Railway (LSWR) goods traffic. The first passenger trains started to run through to the East Quay in 1882, generally running \\"non-stop\\" to London Paddington station except for locomotive changes. Competition with the LSWR's services from Ocean Quay on Stonehouse Pool lead to increasing speeds from 1904, although mail was only contracted to be carried on the GWR services. On 9 May 1904 City of Truro was the first locomotive recorded in excess of while working one of the GWR's trains, with the whole journey to London taking just 3 hours 54 minutes. The GWR route was shortened by 20¼ miles on 1 July 1906 with the opening of the Castle Cary Cut-Off line that avoided the \\"Great Way Round\\" through Bristol Temple Meads, but in the early hours of 30 June 1906 an LSWR special had derailed at high speed passing through Salisbury railway station, after which speeds returned to a more sedate pace, with trains taking around five hours. The LSWR service was closed in 1910. The quayside was open to the elements until 1905 when a canopy was provided, although passengers and their luggage were dealt with in the lower floors of some Brunel-designed warehouses. Improved accommodation was provided in 1936, the new floor of which was decorated with the GWR's land at Plymouth and save a day advertising slogan, which referred to the time saved by trans-Atlantic passengers being carried ashore by lighter at Plymouth from liners bound for London via Southampton or Le Havre. A new swing bridge with a railway track was put in place in 1945 to link Glasgow Quay (opposite the entrance from Millbay station) and South Quay. The last passenger trains ran from the docks in 1963, the final year of trans- Atlantic liners calling at the port. Freight traffic continued until 30 June 1971. Signalling The first signal box was built in 1899 as one of the first stages of the rebuilding of the station. This long structure was on the east side of the line with 117 levers in a Type DT frame. It was replaced in 1914 by a long box housing 115 levers in a Type HT3 frame. This in turn was closed on 14 December 1969 when control of the remaining trains was transferred to the new Plymouth Panel Signal Box at North Road. Another small box was provided at Millbay Crossing to control the level crossing on Millbay Road.

Early life Chuck Negron was born on June 8, 1942, in Manhattan to Charles Negron and Elizabeth Rooke. When Negron was five years old, his father, a nightclub singer, and his mother divorced. Negron and his twin sister, Nancy, were placed in an orphanage by their mother who took them back again two years later. Negron grew up in The Bronx, where he sang in local doo-wop groups and played basketball both in schoolyard pick-up games and at William Howard Taft High School. The latter talent led to his being recruited to play basketball at Allan Hancock College, a small community college in Santa Maria, California; later, he played at California State University, Los Angeles. Career = Music = In 1967, singer Danny Hutton invited Negron to join him and Cory Wells to found the band Three Dog Night. The group became one of the most successful bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s, selling approximately 60 million records and earning gold records for such songs as \\"One\\", \\"Easy To Be Hard\\", and \\"Joy to the World\\". Negron was primary vocalist on the hits \\"One\\", \\"Easy To Be Hard\\", \\"Joy to the World\\", \\"Pieces Of April\\", \\"Old Fashioned Love Song\\", and \\"The Show Must Go On\\". The rock and roll lifestyle took its toll on Negron, and by the time Three Dog Night disbanded in 1976, Negron had a serious heroin addiction which began in the early 1970s. In July 1975, the British music magazine, NME, reported that Negron had been arrested for cocaine possession in Kentucky. He overcame his addiction in September 1991 and embarked on a solo career, recording the albums: *Am I Still In Your Heart? (1995) *Joy to the World (1996), a Christmas CD *Long Road Back (1999) *Chuck Negron – Live In Concert (2001), a double CD set, recorded at Southern Methodist University (Dallas) and released on Sindrome Records, with sidemen Richard Campbell on bass guitar, Danny Mishkit on guitar, keyboards and saxophone, Frank Reina on drums and Terence Elliott on lead guitar *Live and In Concert (2005) *The Chuck Negron Story (2005) *Negron Generations (2017) = Book = He wrote his autobiography, Three Dog Nightmare (1999), in which he describes his life as a high school athlete, member of a successful rock band, and drug addict. In the book, he discusses his descent into drug abuse and attributes his recovery from heroin addiction to his turning to God in desperation, after dropping out from more than thirty drug treatment facilities. A revised edition with several new chapters was released in 2008, with an updated version released in 2018. Personal life In 2006, Negron was featured in an episode of the A&E; reality show, Intervention, about his son Chuckie and grandson, Noah Negron. Negron has been married three times. He was married to Paula Louise Ann Goetten from 1970-73. They had one daughter, Shaunti Negron-Levick. In 1976, he married Julia Densmore, the former wife of The Doors drummer John Densmore. They were married for twelve years, with Chuck stepping into the role of step dad for her son, Berry Duane Oakley, Jr. They also had a son, Charles Negron III (Chuckie). In 1993, Negron married Robin Silna. They had a daughter, Charlotte Rose Negron, and they divorced in 2001. Negron also has a daughter, Annabelle Negron, with actress Kate Vernon. Taylor Negron (an actor, comedian, painter, and playwright) was Negron's cousin.

A Mexican title was granted to Antonio Maria Ortega in 1834 by Mexican Governor José Figueroa.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant extended along the Pacific coast from Cojo Canyon east of Point Conception, past Arroyo Hondo and Tajiguas Canyon, to Refugio Canyon, and encompassed much of the Gaviota Coast.Diseño del Rancho Nuestra Senora del RefugioSanta Barbara County Rancho Map History The first European visitors to California were Spanish maritime explorers led by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who sailed up and down the coast in 1542. Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno again sailed along the California coast in 1602. Spanish ships associated with the Manila Galleon trade probably made emergency stops along the coast during the next 167 years, but no permanent settlements were established. The first land expedition to California, led by Gaspar de Portolà, camped at today's Tajiguas Creek on August 23, 1769, on its way to Monterey Bay. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, who accompanied the expedition, noted the presence of two native towns, facing each other across the creek, near the ocean—similar to the arrangement found the previous day at Dos Pueblos. The following two days, August 24–25, the expedition moved on along the coast to the west, still over lands that later belonged to the rancho. On the 24th, the camp was at Gaviota Creek, and now Gaviota State Park. The soldiers named the place La Gaviota (Spanish for seagull). On the 25th, the party camped at today's El Bullito Creek, about halfway between Gaviota and Point Conception. The rancho was granted to José Francisco Ortega, who in 1769 had served as an expedition scout for that first Portola expedition. As leader of the scouts, Ortega was among the first Europeans to see many places in California, including San Francisco Bay. Ortega played an important role in the founding of the Santa Barbara Presidio in 1782. In 1786, after his retirement, Ortega received approval for the Rancho Nuestra Señora del Refugio land grant and built his home in Refugio Canyon in 1794. Ortega Family The grant was confirmed to his son Antonio Maria Ortega in 1834 by Mexican Governor Figueroa. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Nuestra Señora del Refugio was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 154 SD and patented to Antonio Maria Ortega in 1866. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 The first sale of lands belonging to Rancho Nuestra Senora del Refugio to non-family members, the Gaviota Ranch, occurred in 1858. In 1866, Thomas B. Dibblee of Rancho San Julian, acquired several parcels originally included in the Rancho, and he eventually owned approximately three-quarters of the original grant. William Welles Hollister purchased the Hollister Ranch land in 1866. The Dibblee-Hollister partnership owned several land grants in the Santa Barbara area. With the sale of Arroyo Hondo in 1889, all rancho lands had been sold by the Ortegas.Hvolboll, E. P., 1990, The property God has given me: A brief history of the Ortega Family's Rancho Nuestra Sefiora del Refugio, Noticias 34(3):45–64.

Privateers under Hippolyte Bouchard burned the original ranch buildings at Refugio Canyon in 1818, but the adobes at Arroyo Hondo and Canada del Corral still remain.

It is an hour-long episode and brings to a climax the romantic character arc between Niles and Daphne, a significant running plotline for the first seven years of the show's production. Plot =Part I= Frasier, Daphne, Niles, Mel and Martin return from the funeral of Morrie, the doorman of Elliott Bay Towers. Daphne in particular is very emotional, which everyone attributes to nerves before the wedding. Martin bears a final gift from Morrie; a rare bottle of wine retrieved from France following the Second World War. Simon, Daphne's boorish and obnoxious brother, arrives unexpectedly, and Martin invites him to stay in his Winnebago. Mel leaves to prepare for a mid-week retreat to celebrate her first six months with Niles, while he confesses to Frasier that he feels anxious about their relationship. After Niles denies that he still possesses lingering feelings for Daphne, Frasier urges his brother to seize the moment and move on from his habitual sense of caution. When Martin gives Daphne the bottle of wine as a wedding gift, Daphne breaks down once more. Frasier is left to comfort Daphne, and Daphne reveals that she knows about Niles' seven-year crush on her. She has tormented herself about her own feelings towards Niles, and believes that she has fallen in love with him in return. Despite her impending marriage, Frasier urges her to confront Niles and discuss this with him before her marriage. When Niles returns, however, he has exciting news: he has, on impulse, eloped with Mel and married her. =Part II= Frasier arrives at the luxurious hotel where Daphne and Donny's wedding will take place, hoping to speak to Daphne about recent events. Daphne brushes the matter off, dismissing her feelings as just nerves, and gives Frasier the bottle of wine to thank him for all his kindness and support. They are interrupted by the arrival of Daphne's overbearing and hypercritical mother, Gertrude. That night following the rehearsal dinner, Frasier and Martin discuss Daphne and Niles. Frasier confesses that he does not believe either Daphne or Niles when they claim to be happy, leading Martin to warn him about interfering; two marriages are at stake. Meanwhile, Niles and Daphne join each other for a dance, and Frasier watches them as they dance close together. Cornering Niles in a hotel room, Frasier reveals that Daphne knows how he feels towards her, and that there is a possibility she shares his feelings. Niles is tormented, but resolves to talk to Daphne to find out. Managing to get Daphne alone, Niles confesses that Frasier has told him of her feelings towards him, and tells her that he loves her. Before they can discuss anything, they are constantly interrupted, firstly by Martin, then by Donny, then Mel, and finally by Daphne's entire family. Escaping the party to the balcony, the two stand together awkwardly, until Daphne takes action, and the two share their first kiss. She then tells him that they have made too many commitments to others to back out now. Niles is left on the balcony, alone. The next morning, as the wedding takes place, Niles sits in the front cabin of the Winnebago, unable to watch Daphne be married. Martin and Frasier join him, Frasier bringing with him the rare bottle of wine to honour Niles' bravery in at last opening his heart to Daphne. The three men prepare to enjoy a glass, only to discover that the wine is undrinkable; unfortunately, Morrie kept his wine rack in the boiler room. Frasier and Martin leave to attend the wedding, leaving Niles alone, until a knock at the door rouses him. He turns to see Daphne before him in full wedding dress, asking him if he wants to go on a date. She has chosen him after all, and as the two prepare to flee the wedding, Daphne realises that she can finally call him \\"Niles\\".

Thunder Perfect Mind is an album by the English group Nurse with Wound. It is a \\"sister\\" album to Current 93's album Thunder Perfect Mind, released around the same time; some basic sounds and lyrics are shared but the overall sound of each record is very different. In David Keenan's England's Hidden Reverse, Nurse with Wound mastermind Steven Stapleton explains that he had a dream in which he was handing David Tibet of Current 93 a copy of a new NWW album and that the record was called Thunder Perfect Mind, the title already chosen by Tibet for his imminent new release. Upon hearing of this dream, Tibet immediately agreed to share the title. The album revolves around two lengthy tracks; \\"Cold\\" is a driving industrial piece full of relentlessly chaotic machinery noises, while \\"Colder Still\\" is a sweeping dark ambient piece, ending with an extended version of \\"Thunder Perfect Mind II\\" from Current 93's Thunder Perfect Mind. After a brief silence, the release concludes with a short answerphone message left by John Balance. Excerpts and reworkings of \\"Cold\\" have appeared in various forms on several other Nurse with Wound releases, most notably the single \\"Steel Dream March of the Metal Men\\", the a-side of which was entirely derived from the track. Although issued by Stapleton on his own imprint via World Serpent, the label is listed as \\"Untied Diaries\\" rather than the usual \\"United Dairies\\". This was the first NWW album to feature Colin Potter, who has collaborated with Stapleton on almost all subsequent NWW releases. The album was finally released on vinyl in 2002 on the Streamline label, distributed through Drag City, with \\"Colder Still\\" being divided over two sides of vinyl. A remix of \\"Cold\\" was added to both the re-issued vinyl and a remastered CD on United Dairies. An edit of \\"Cold\\" was featured on the compilation Livin' Fear of James Last.

It uses mostly floral motifs, especially Persian figures, animals, and patterns related to hunting. Persian embroidered women's trouserings, also known as \\"Gilets Persans\\", have rich patterns; these were in fashion until the late 18th century. The designs are always of diagonal, parallel bands filled with floral ornamentation. History =Sassanid era= Persian embroidery existed from the ancient times and at least from the time of the Sassanids. Numerous designs are visible on rock sculptures and silverware of that period, and have been classified by Professor Ernst Herzfeld. Patterns on the coat of Chosroes II at Taq-e Bostan are in high relief; they may represent embroidery. Roundels, animals, and other familiar motives of Sassanid art were also used. Peculiarities The earlier Persian embroideries are almost all of type in which the design covers the entire work. The reverse is mainly true of the later pieces, in which the plain-coloured background is equally as important as the varied silks of the needlework. Earlier pieces are almost all similar in design to one or other of the many types of carpets. These are mainly worked in darning-stitch on cotton or loosely woven linen, while occasional examples are in cross-stitch or tent-stitch. Carpet-weaving was mainly done by men, and embroidery by women; members of the same family worked at both trades. References * Brief guide to Persian embroideries.

Respondents who provide a score of 7 or 8 are referred to as “passives” and enter into the overall percentage calculation. The result of the calculation is expressed without the percentage sign. It is a management tool used as a measure of customer satisfaction and has been shown to correlate with revenue growth relative to competitors.Call Centers for Dummies, By Real Bergevin, Afshan Kinder, Winston Siegel, Bruce Simpson, p.345 NPS has been widely adopted by Fortune 500 companies and other organizations. Companies, employers, or other bodies ask the questions of customer, employee, or other respondents such as resellers, implementation partners, and suppliers. NPS ranges between −100 (all respondents are \\"detractors\\") and +100 (all respondents are \\"promoters\\"). Scores vary substantially between industries, so a good score is simply one whose trend is better than that of competitors in the same industry, as measured by double- blind benchmark research. The metric was developed by (and is a registered trademark of) Fred Reichheld, Bain & Company and Satmetrix. It was introduced by Reichheld in his 2003 Harvard Business Review article, \\"The One Number You Need to Grow\\". Its popularity and broad use have been attributed to its simplicity and its openly available methodology. How it works The Net Promoter Score is calculated based on responses to a single question: How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague? The scoring for this answer is most often based on a 0 to 10 scale. Those who respond with a score of 9 to 10 are called Promoters, and are considered likely to exhibit value-creating behaviors, such as buying more, remaining customers for longer, and making more positive referrals to other potential customers. Those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors, and they are believed to be less likely to exhibit the value- creating behaviors. Responses of 7 and 8 are labeled Passives, and their behavior falls between Promoters and Detractors. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. For purposes of calculating a Net Promoter Score, Passives count toward the total number of respondents, thus decreasing the percentage of detractors and promoters and pushing the net score toward 0.Satmetrix Net Promoter web site The Net Promoter Score and System Companies are encouraged to follow the likely-to-recommend question with an open-ended request for elaboration, soliciting the reasons for a customer's rating of that company or product. These reasons can then be provided to front-line employees and management teams for follow-up action. The open-ended question is often a conditional one meaning that it only appears if the customer gives below a certain threshold, such as below 7 (detractor). Local office branch managers at Charles Schwab Corporation, for example, call back customers to engage them in a discussion about the feedback they provided through the NPS survey process, solve problems, and learn more so they can coach account representatives. Reichheld and Co-Author, Rob Markey say the rating and answers to the \\"Why?\\" question provide all that is needed to identify reference customers and improvement opportunities. Practitioners often claim that responses to the \\"Why\\" question provide more important information than the score, itself. USAA and Verizon, for example, both claim that the score is less important than the reasons why. For some, the lack of any easy way to automatically analyze the verbatim answers without human bias is problematic. Others, such as Dell or Intuit, claim that technology helps analyze the verbatim responses effectively. Additional questions can be included to assist with understanding the perception of various products, services, and lines of business. These additional questions help a company rate the relative importance of these other parts of the business in the overall score. This is especially helpful in targeting resources to address issues that most impact the NPS. Companies using the Net Promoter System often rely on software as a service vendors that offer a full suite of metrics, reporting, and analytics. The primary objective of the Net Promoter Score methodology is to predict customer loyalty (as evidenced by repurchase and referral) to a product, service, brand, or company. Reichheld and Markey developed the methodology by comparing the ability of several different questions to predict future purchases and referrals of individual respondents. They chose the likelihood to recommend question based on the observation that it best predicted these customer behaviors in 11 of 14 industries studied. They also found that differences in Net Promoter Scores among direct competitors in a market could explain substantial differences in revenue growth rates among competitors in that market. Importantly, Markey points out that \\"competitive benchmark\\" Net Promoter Scores collected through a carefully constructed double-blind Quantitative marketing research methodology provide the only valid basis for comparing scores. Net Promoter System also requires a process to close the loop. In closing the loop, the provider actively intervenes to learn more from customers who have provided feedback, and also to change a negative perception, often converting a Detractor into a Promoter. The Net Promoter survey will identify customers who need follow-up, including Detractors, and should automatically alert the provider to contact the consumer and manage the follow-up and actions from that point, a practice followed by companies such as Scotiabank. Proponents of the Net Promoter approach claim the score can be used to motivate an organization to become more focused on improving products and services. The Net Promoter approach has been adopted by several companies, including Australia Post, Siemens, E.ON, Philips, GE,\\"With Its Stock Still Lackluster, G.E. Confronts the Curse of the Conglomerate,\\" New York Times, 16 August 2006 Apple Retail,\\"Another Myth Bites The Dust: How Apple Listens To Its Customers,\\" Forbes.com, 26 August 2011 American Express, IBM, Vanguard, and Intuit.\\"Would You Recommend Us?\\" Business Week, 29 January 2006. It has also emerged as a way to measure loyalty for online applications, as well as social game products.\\"Net Promoter Score for Social Gaming,\\" 28 February 2011. Some proponents of the Net Promoter Score suggest that the same methodology can be used to measure, evaluate and manage employee loyalty. They claim that collecting the feedback from employees in a manner similar to Net Promoter customer feedback can provide companies a way to improve their culture. What is sometimes called the \\"employee Net Promoter Score\\" or eNPS has been compared to other employee satisfaction metrics and some companies have claimed that it correlates well with those other metrics. For some industries, notably software and services, it has been shown that Detractors tend to remain with a company and Passives leave. This appears to be the case where switching barriers are relatively high. In the face of criticisms of the Net Promoter Score, the proponents of the Net Promoter approach claim that the statistical analyses presented prove only that the \\"recommend\\" question is of similar predictive power to other metrics, but fail to address its practical benefits, which are at the heart of the argument Reichheld put forth. Proponents also counter that analyses based on third- party data are inferior to those conducted by companies on their own customer sets, and that the practical benefits of the approach (short survey, simple concept to communicate, ability to follow up with customers) outweigh any statistical inferiority. They also allow that a survey using any other question can be used within the Net Promoter System, as long as it meets the criteria of sorting customers reliably into promoters, passives and detractors. Criticism of NPS While the Net Promoter Score has gained popularity among business executives, it has also attracted controversy from academic and market research circles. = Lack of superiority to other loyalty-related questions = Research by Keiningham, Cooil, Andreassen and Aksoy disputes that the Net Promoter metric is the best predictor of company growth. Furthermore, Hayes (2008) claimed there was no scientific evidence that the \\"likelihood to recommend\\" question is a better predictor of business growth than other customer-loyalty questions (e.g., overall satisfaction, likelihood to purchase again). Specifically, Hayes stated that the \\"likelihood to recommend\\" question does not measure anything different from other conventional loyalty-related questions.Hayes (2008), \\"The True Test of Loyalty,\\" Quality Progress, June 2008, 20–26. The customer metrics included in this study perform equally well in predicting current company performance.\\"Satisfaction as a Predictor of Future Performance: A Replication. Jenny van Doorn , Peter S.H. Leeflang, Marleen Tijs International Journal of Research in Marketing (Impact Factor: 1.71). 12/2013 = No evidence for 11 point scale superiority = While several studies, such as one by Preston and Colman, have shown that there is little statistical difference in reliability, validity, or discriminating power, an unpublished paper by Schneider et al (2008) found a more nuanced pattern. Out of four scales tested in two studies (the original LTR with neutral label, a 7-point version with neutral label, a 7 point fully labeled, and 5 point fully labeled), the 7-point scales were better than the 11-point scale advocated by Reichheld, with partly-labeled scale outperforming all others by a smaller margin in predicting stated historical recommendations . = Reliability compared to a composite index of questions = \\"A single item question is much less reliable and more volatile than a composite index.\\" \\"Furthermore, combining CFMs (customer feedback metrics), along with simultaneously investigating multiple dimensions of the customer relationship, improves predictions even further.\\" = Lack of predictive power for loyalty behaviors = \\"Recommend intention alone will not suffice as a single predictor of customers' future loyalty behaviors. Use of multiple indicators instead of a single predictor model performs significantly better in predicting customer recommendations and retention.\\" \\"…given the present state of evidence, it cannot be recommended to use the NPI as a predictor of growth nor financial performance.\\" =Not suitable as key performance indicator= As part of a critical analysis of the Net Promoter Score, Ralf Lisch highlighted that \\"it is a weak point of the approach that the so-called passives are shut out from the score although they have an influence on the percentage of the remaining two categories.\\" Furthermore, losing detractors as customers can improve the NPS while the business eventually suffers. Lisch comes to the conclusion that contrary to the claim that the Net Promoter Score is \\"the one number you need to grow\\", the NPS is not suitable as key performance indicator.

It is marketed by AgroFresh Solutions, Inc., a publicly held (NASDAQ:AGFS) U.S. company with global operations. SmartFresh technology halts the fruits and vegetables' natural ripening process to prolong freshness. Function 1-MCP blocks the effects of both endogenous and exogenous ethylene through preferential attachment to the ethylene receptor. It is applied in storage facilities and transit containers to slow down the ripening process and the production of ethylene in fruit. Ethylene agent is not useful postharvest for fruit that is already ripe. The method of prolonging produce lifetime in this way was approved by the EU in 2005, and can be combined with standard controlled atmosphere technology. Consumer concerns The use of 1-MCP to prevent fruit ripening came under scrutiny by the press during late 2005, when it was shown that the method is occasionally used to inhibit ripening of fruit by as much as a year, causing consumers to purchase year-old fruit without being aware of it. Fruits which have been treated with 1-MCP do not trigger any labelling regulations, and are allowed for use with certified organic foods, and are therefore non-distinguishable from non-treated products.Europeans buying year- old apples In the United States the National Organic Program does not allow the use of 1-MCP on organic produce, however the only test devised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency; radioisolated analytical method is too expensive, though it can measure residues on fruit up to 90 days post treatment. Its convenience of application makes it easily accessible for farmers and producers. Fruits which have been treated with 1-MCP do not trigger any labeling regulations. Studies have shown there is no residue left on the fruit post processing. Identified as a synthetic, 1-MCP is not approved for use on U.S. foods labeled “organic” by the United States Department of Agriculture. 1-MCP has regulatory approval for use on produce in more than 30 countries, including the U.S. and European Union. By 2006, retailers were split on whether this quality enhancer should be used. In a True Food Network publication of Greenpeace,True Food Network : News Apple & Pear Australia business manager Tony Russell claimed that prolonged lifetime of produce is necessary to deliver edible fruit during the whole year, and that these fruits are still healthy. He was countered by Sydney Postharvest Laboratory director Dr Stephen Morris in that Vitamin C and antioxidant levels may still decline, a concern also shared by others in the industry. SmartFresh is perceived by Susan Kegley, a senior scientist at the San Francisco-based Pesticide Action Network North America, as being “likely to be very low-risk to consumers”. Other scientists see 1-MCP as \\"most likely harmless to humans\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/dining/25fruit.html?pagewanted=2 See also *Post-harvest losses (fruit and vegetables) References =Notes= =Bibliography= * New York Times (2006).

The line was built by the Great Central Railway (GCR), was absorbed by the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923, and became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways. It ran mainly on reserved track.  History  G&IER; car 18 (also formerly Gateshead No 18, built by the company in 1923) is washed at Pyewipe Depot before making its last journey. The origin of the line lay in the decision of the Great Central Railway (GCR) to build a vast new docks complex on the marshlands of the south bank of the Humber near the small settlement of Immingham. The GCR reached agreement for the purchase of the land required and presented two Bills in Parliament of which the second was enacted as the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act 1904. A number of railways was authorised in connection with the construction and operation of the dock estate, comprising a new main-line railway approaching from Ulceby in the south (the Humber Commercial Railway); a branch from Goxhill in the west, facilitating services to and from New Holland and the Humber ferries (the Barton and Immingham Light Railway); and a direct link towards Grimsby (the Grimsby District Light Railway, GDLR, for which light railway powers were granted on 15 January 1906). Dock operation was labour-intensive and the GCR recognised that it would need to operate a passenger service to bring in dockers from neighbouring towns, principally the fishing port of Great Grimsby about seven miles east. The company also built a large locomotive depot at Immingham, which required workers’ transport. These enactments and considerations were the starting point of the G&IER.; Ex-GCR car 15, built in 1915, passes Pyewipe depot outbound for Immingham To facilitate construction of the docks the GDLR was initially built from the Grimsby direction as a contractors’ railway and the GCR ran a steam-hauled workmen's service on this from 3 January 1910. The GCR had two reasons for proposing an electric tramway in addition to this light railway. (Legally the G&IER; would form part of the GDLR, although there was no physical connection between them). They had developed a major power generating plant at the Docks, which used electricity extensively for crane and lock operation. This could economically supply the tramway, and did so until 1957. Secondly they envisaged on-street operation in Grimsby itself, extending the area served and facilitating direct connexion with the existing Grimsby and Cleethorpes tramways. The GCR's 1906 light railway order included a 1½ mile street tramway between Corporation Bridge and Cleveland Bridge in Grimsby, and a private right-of way alongside the existing GDLR between Cleveland Bridge and Immingham Dock. The network An ex-GCR car leaves Immingham Town for Grimsby on 1 July 1961. On the far left is the Grimsby District Light Railway The electric line opened from Grimsby as far as Immingham Town on the eastern fringe of the dock estate on Wednesday 15 May 1912. It was extended about a mile into the estate on 17 November 1913, terminating at the landward end of the Eastern Jetty, a short walk from the Immingham Dock station of the Barton and Immingham Light Railway. For reasons not fully understood the 1913 extension joined the existing line at Immingham Town by a trailing junction, necessitating a reversal on all through journeys. A short spur was built in 1914 from Immingham Town terminus to Queens Road nearer Immingham Village, but this was never opened to normal traffic, possibly because of the onset of the First World War. The G&IER; from Corporation Bridge to Immingham Town was single track with passing loops of a standard length of . The 1913 extension from Immingham Town to Immingham Dock was double track alongside the road, except where it shared the road as it crossed \\"Tramcar Bridge\\" east of Immingham Town. There were originally eight intermediate loops on the cross- country Pyewipe – Immingham Town section, numbered in sequence from Pyewipe, although most stops also had names. Four of the loops were removed in 1917, the track being used for war purposes. There were three or possibly four loops on the street section in Grimsby. There were small waiting rooms and offices at Corporation Bridge and Immingham Dock termini. A temporary structure was erected at Cleveland Bridge after the line was cut back in 1956. Although the Grimsby terminus at Corporation Bridge was only a few yards from the municipal tramway tracks in Victoria Street the intervening bridge was not rebuilt until 1928, and by then Grimsby's trams were giving way to trolleybuses and the connecting tramway was never built. The G&IER; did, however, operate a local tram service on its street section between Corporation Bridge and Cleveland Bridge for two years 1928 – 1930.  Power supply  The line was electrified at 500 volts direct current, with power supplied through simple trolley wire supported either from span wires between steel poles (concrete poles between Immingham Town and Immingham Dock), or from side brackets. Current collection was by trolley poles. A separate high-tension feeder on wooden poles ran alongside the line, providing current for dock operation in Grimsby. Traction power was at first supplied by two substations, transformed and converted from a 6,600 volt ac main fed from the docks generating station. The first was built three miles from Immingham by Siemens Brothers. Two Westinghouse 250 kW rotary converters produced 500 V DC for the trams. Traction feeders were installed every half-mile. The substation itself was a redbrick construction, built by Dennis Gill & Sons of Doncaster for £507. The 1913 extension was supplied by a substation within the dock estate. The second substation, continuously manned, was also built by Gill, for £707, next to the car sheds at Pyewipe. It contained three 250 kW Westinghouse rotary converters. One converter was used for lighting, one for traction and the third as a standby. From 26 November 1957 high tension power was drawn from the National Grid and the dock power station was closed down.  Pyewipe car sheds  Ex-Gateshead car No 17 at Pyewipe, built 1928, was rebuilt by British Railways as a well- equipped repair car, and renumbered 320224. The line's tower wagon stands behind it. The sheds were formally known as \\"Cleveland Bridge Works\\" but rarely so in practice, gaining the name \\"Pyewipe\\" from nearby marshes and road on the edge of Grimsby. They serviced all the trams. They did not house the cars, which, unusually for British trams, spent all their life outdoors, only entering the workshop when repairs were needed. The workshop had the capacity to hold three trams on two tracks. It also housed a machine shop, paint shop and store. Until 1940 cars were periodically sent to Dukinfield carriage works for major repair. The second-hand Gateshead cars (see below) were overhauled at York before entering service. The G&IER; had no physical connection with the national network apart from a right-angled flat crossing with a siding near Corporation Bridge which was unusable for interchange traffic. The line closed long before the days when putting a tram on the back of a low-loader to take it to Manchester would be normal. When heavy repairs were needed or new trams were delivered they were craned between tramway metals and the GDLR which ran past the shed.  Rolling stock  The controls of the ex-GCR tramcars were basic: a Dick, Kerr DB1, Form K4 controller and a vertically- mounted hand brake wheel The line was originally equipped with eight unique bogie single-decked tramcars, designed by the GCR and built by Brush, to which four more were added in 1913, and a further four (built by the GCR themselves) in 1914. Four of the original cars were short-bodied, intended for through operation onto the Grimsby street tramways, but the majority of the fleet, at 43 feet 8 inches (16.51 metres) overall length, were by far the largest British trams until modern times: with 72 seats, they had a larger capacity than many contemporary double-deckers. Although relatively progressive for the period, the cars lacked what were already becoming refinements in Europe: they used trolley-poles not pantograph collectors and they lacked any means of coupled or multiple-unit operation, thus failing to exploit the main labour- saving qualities of modern tramcars. The cars had wooden swing-back lateral seats throughout their lives. They had a central luggage and goods compartment (known locally as \\"The Horse Box\\") and handled milk, produce, and small consignments. All remaining cars were painted in BR ‘electric green’ after 1951, replacing LNER brown livery. Ex-Gateshead car No 17 After 1945 Grimsby Corporation promoted a 200-acre industrial estate west of the town and near the G&IER;, and in the absence of any direct road, workers at the new factories also relied on the tramway. To handle the extra passenger traffic British Railways acquired three single-decked bogie trams from Newcastle Corporation Transport in 1948 (the only cars on the line to have upholstered seats)ex-Newcastle cars at Immingham, via Britain from AboveAn ex-Newcastle and an ex-GCR tramcar at Corporation Bridge BingA Newcastle car on Tyneside flickr and a further nineteen were bought in 1951 from the Gateshead and District Tramways Company, which had just ceased operation (one was dropped whilst being craned into the shed during delivery and destroyed, so only eighteen entered service). The ex-Gateshead cars had wooden longitudinal bench seats, allowing more standing room down the vehicles' centres. By then the four ‘short’ trams had been withdrawn, though one of them, No.5, was converted into a works car. The ex-Newcastle trams and four GCR-type cars were withdrawn by 1953, the body of one of the latter - No.10 - was used as a shed at Pyewipe depot. The undertaking had a maximum of 25 passenger trams in operation by 1954 out of 37 supplied. One of the Gateshead cars was adapted as a works vehicle, at which point the earlier works car - No. 5 - was scrapped. The new works car was given District Engineer's number DE320224, probably the highest ever carried by a tram anywhere.  Operations  The 1948 timetable - typical of the line's heyday Because of the particular needs of the workforce the G&IER; was unique amongst British tramways in operating a service throughout every day and night for most of its existence. Normally service during the day was every 20 or 30 minutes with less frequent trams overnight and extras at peak times. Because traffic was very heavily peaked, departures at shift- change times often took the form of convoys of up to seven trams. Running time was 27 minutes. At the line's peak in the 1950s 19 cars were required in service, reduced to ten after 1959. 24 cars were in running order when the line closed. A typical G&IER; ticket of the final type. These were issued by conductors on board the trams. As an integral part of the railway system, GCR, LNER, and later BR, the tramway featured in the public railway timetables and through tickets were issued from the rest of the system. Amongst others, printed tickets between King's Cross and Immingham Dock ‘via electric cars’ were available. Local ticketing used the colourful and complex ‘Bell Punch’ system until the end. The final G&IER; timetable: after 1959 the trams only ran in the rush hours The railway was not signalled, unlike many other single- track tramways, although local signals were introduced after the Second World War at two level crossings. The track on street sections in Grimsby and at Immingham used conventional grooved tramway rail; the private track sections were originally laid with flat-bottomed rail, replaced later by railway- pattern bullhead rail, and the pointwork required a different wheel profile from that normally used on tramways.  Closure  Letter announcing the line's closure GEx-GCR car No 12, built by Brush in 1913, formed the last public working at 14.03 from Immingham Dock on 1 July 1961, seen here reversing at Immingham Town Handling highly peaked traffic, much of it railway or dock employees travelling either free or at reduced fares, was never lucrative despite high passenger numbers (1.35 million in 1948 and over a million as late as 1956), but as long as docks and railway were under common ownership and management this was a lesser consideration. Although partly re- laid in 1950 the in-town street section was closed from 1 July 1956 when Grimsby Corporation exercised their right to buy the line in order to abandon it, and the trams then terminated at the edge of Grimsby with a connecting bus service. Closure of the remainder was first proposed in 1958, and a bus service commenced on 28 February 1959, worked jointly over an indirect route by Grimsby Corporation and the Lincolnshire Road Car Company. A tram service was only retained in much curtailed form in peak periods, pending completion of a direct road to the industrial estate and the docks. Although the road had still not been built the tramway was again proposed for closure in 1960, and the service was finally withdrawn on 1 July 1961. Even at closure it was still handling around 250,000 passengers a year. On the last day special trams were operated for enthusiasts, and a ceremonial last car (GCR-type tram No 4) was decorated and carried a commemorative headboard, leaving Immingham Dock at 14.12.

Major cities in the numbering plan area (NPA) include Burlington, Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids, Oelwein, Fort Madison, Iowa City, Keokuk, Mount Pleasant, and Waterloo. Despite its relatively modest population, Iowa was assigned three area codes when the area code system was implemented in 1947, one for each third of the state. 319 covered the eastern third, and stretched along the entire border with Wisconsin and Illinois. By the end of the 20th century, it was felt that the 319 code was running out of available numbers due to the increase in mobile devices, lines for computer equipment, FAX machines, and other services. In late 2000 it was announced that a new area code 563 would be assigned to northeastern Iowa. Cell phone service providers hoped that it would be an overlay since it would not require reprogramming of cell phones. However, overlays were still a relatively new concept at the time, and met with considerable resistance due to the requirements for 10-digit dialing and mixing of area codes within the same area. In the end, it was decided that a geographic split would be employed. As a result, the northeastern portion of the old 319 territory, including Bettendorf, Clinton, Davenport, Decorah, Dubuque and Eldridge, was shifted to the new 563 area code. The new code became operational in March 2001, and became mandatory in December 2001.

Traffic pumping Many calling card and conference service providers operate in area 641. For calls to a rural number in area 641, the long distance provider has to pay the termination fee to the receiving telecom party: up to 8 cents a minute. Using this arbitrage, some of the service providers operate here and require one to dial the \\"local access number\\" in area 641. Large telecom providers are the hardest hit with the costs for these so-called free service providers.

He is one of the Saptarishis (seven great Rishis) of India. Vashistha is credited as the chief author of Mandala 7 of the Rigveda. Vashishtha and his family are mentioned in Rigvedic verse 10.167.4, other Rigvedic mandalas and in many Vedic texts.\\"according to Rig Veda 7.33:11 he is the son of Maitravarun and Urvashi\\" Prof. Shrikant Prasoon, Pustak Mahal, 2009, , . His ideas have been influential and he was called as the first sage of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy by Adi Shankara. The Yoga Vashishtha, Vashishtha Samhita, as well as some versions of the Agni Purana and Vishnu Purana are attributed to him. He is the subject of many legends, such as him being in possession of the divine cow Kamadhenu and Nandini her child, who could grant anything to their owners. He is famous in Hindu legends for his legendary conflicts with sage Vishvamitra. In the Ramayana, he was the family priest of the Raghu dynasty and teacher of Lord Rama and his brothers. Etymology Vashishtha is also spelled as ' and is Sanskrit for \\"most excellent, best or richest. According to Monier-Williams, it is sometimes incorrectly spelt as Vashishta or Vashistha (', )., Archive 2 History In Rigvedic hymn 7.33.9, Vashishtha is described as a scholar who moved across the Indus river to establish his school. He was married to Arundhati, and therefore he was also called Arundhati Nath, meaning the husband of Arundhati. Vashishtha is believed to have lived on the banks of Ganga in modern-day Uttarakhand. Later, this region is believed in the Indian tradition to be the abode of sage Vyasa along with Pandavas, the five brothers of Mahabharata. He is typically described in ancient and medieval Hindu texts as a sage with long flowing hairs that are neatly tied into a bun that is coiled with a tuft to the right, a beard, a handlebar moustache and a tilak on his forehead. In Buddhist Pali canonical texts such as Digha Nikaya, Tevijja Sutta describes a discussion between the Buddha and Vedic scholars of his time. The Buddha names ten rishis, calls them \\"early sages\\" and makers of ancient verses that have been collected and chanted in his era, and among those ten rishi is Vasettha (the Pali spelling of Vashishtha in Sanskrit). =Ideas= Vashishtha is the author of the seventh book of the Rigveda, one of its \\"family books\\" and among the oldest layer of hymns in the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism. The hymns composed by Vashishtha are dedicated to Agni, Indra and other gods, but according to RN Dandekar, in a book edited by Michael Witzel, these hymns are particularly significant for four Indravarunau hymns. These have an embedded message of transcending \\"all thoughts of bigotry\\", suggesting a realistic approach of mutual \\"coordination and harmony\\" between two rival religious ideas by abandoning disputed ideas from each and finding the complementary spiritual core in both. These hymns declare two gods, Indra and Varuna, as equally great. In another hymn, particularly the Rigvedic verse 7.83.9, Vashishtha teaches that the Vedic gods Indra and Varuna are complementary and equally important because one vanquishes the evil by the defeat of enemies in battles, while other sustains the good during peace through socio-ethical laws. The seventh mandala of the Rigveda by Vashishtha is a metaphorical treatise. Vashishtha reappears as a character in Hindu texts, through its history, that explore conciliation between conflicting or opposing ideologies.Ramchandra Narayan Dandekar (1981), \\"Vasistha as Religious Conciliator\\", in Exercises in Indology, Delhi: Ajanta, pages 122-132, According to Ellison Findly – a professor of Religion, Vashishtha hymns in the Rigveda are among the most intriguing in many ways and influential. Vashishtha emphasizes means to be as important as ends during one's life, encouraging truthfulness, devotion, optimism, family life, sharing one's prosperity with other members of society, among other cultural values. Texts Vashishtha curses Kaikeyi Vasishtha is a revered sage in the Hindu traditions, and like other revered sages, numerous treatises composed in ancient and medieval era are reverentially named after him. Some treatises named after him or attributed to him include: * The Vashishtha samhita is a medieval era Yoga text. There is an Agama as well with the same title. * The Vashishtha dharmasutra, an ancient text, and one of the few Dharma-related treatises which has survived into the modern era. This Dharmasūtra (300–100 BCE) forms an independent text and other parts of the Kalpasūtra, that is Shrauta- and Grihya-sutras are missing. It contains 1,038 sutras. * The Yoga Vashishtha is a syncretic medieval era text that presents Vedanta and Yoga philosophies. It is written in the form of a dialogue between Vashishtha and prince Rama of Ramayana fame, about the nature of life, human suffering, choices as the nature of life, free will, human creative power and spiritual liberation.Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, , pages 252-253 Yoga Vashishtha teachings are structured as stories and fables, with a philosophical foundation similar to those found in Advaita Vedanta.KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, , page 5 The text is also notable for its discussion of Yoga.G Watts Cunningham (1948), How Far to the Land of Yoga? An Experiment in Understanding, The Philosophical Review, Vol. 57, No. 6, pages 573-589F Chenet (1987), Bhāvanā et Créativité de la Conscience, Numen, Vol. 34, Fasc. 1, pages 45-96 (in French) According to Christopher Chapple – a professor of Indic studies specializing in Yoga and Indian religions, the Yoga Vashishtha philosophy can be summarized as, \\"Human effort can be used for self-betterment and that there is no such thing as an external fate imposed by the gods\\". *The Agni Purana is attributed to Vashishtha. *The Vishnu Purana is attributed to Vashishtha along with Rishi Pulatsya. He has also contributed to many Vedic hymns and is seen as the arranger of Vedas during Dwapara Yuga. Mythology =Birth= According to Mandala 7 of the Rigveda, Mitra-Varuṇa and Urvaśī are his parents. Vashishtha's birth story is found in many later texts including the Devi Bhagavad Purana. He is described to be born thrice. In the first one, he was a Manasputra (mind born son) of Brahma. After the Daksh Yajna, Vasishtha was dead. He was recreated by Brahma, thus his second birth. Vashishth became the royal guru of Nimi, a king. However Nimi forgot to invite Vashishth in a yajna and in rage, Vashishtha cursed Nimi to die soon. Nimi also cursed the same. Frightened, Vashishtha ran towards his father, Brahma. Brahma suggested him to emerge in Varuna and Mitra. When Urvashi was seen by Varuna and Mitra, Vashishth remerged from them. A Vashishtha statue in granite stone. According to Agarwal, one mythical legend states that Vashishtha wanted to commit suicide by falling into river Saraswati. But the river prevented this sacrilege by splitting into hundreds of shallow channels. This story, states Agarwal, may have very ancient roots, where \\"the early man observed the braiding process of the Satluj\\" and because such a legend could not have invented without the residents observing an ancient river (in Rajasthan) drying up and its tributaries such as Sutlej reflowing to merge into Indus river. =Rivalry with Vishwamitra= Vashishtha is known for his feud with Vishwamitra. The king Vishwamitra coveted Vashistha's divine cow Nandini (Kamadhenu) that could fulfil material desires. Vashishtha destroyed Vishwamitra's army and sons. Vishwamitra acquired weapons from Lord Shiva and incinerated Vashishtha's hermitage and sons, but Vashistha baffled all of Vishwamitra's weapons. Vishwamitra betook severe penances for thousands of years and became a Brahmarshi. He even reconciled with Vashishtha. =Disciples= Vashishtha is best known as the priest and preceptor, teacher of the Ikshvaku kings clan. He was also the preceptor of Manu, the progenitor of Kshatriyas and Ikshvaku's father. Other characters like Nahusha, Rantideva, lord Rama and Bhishma were his disciples. When the Bharata king Samvarta lost his kingdom to the Panchalas, he became the disciple of Vashistha. Under Vashistha's guidance, Samvarta regained his kingdom and became the ruler of the earth. The Vashishtha Head A copper casting of a human head styled in the manner described for Vashishtha was discovered in 1958 in Delhi. This piece has been dated to around 3700 BCE, plus minus 800 years, in three western universities (ETH Zurich, Stanford and UC) using among other methods carbon-14 dating tests, spectrographic analysis, X-ray dispersal analysis and metallography.Harry Hicks and Robert Anderson (1990), Analysis of an Indo- European Vedic Aryan Head – 4500-2500 B.C., in Journal of Indo European studies, Vol. 18, pp 425–446. Fall 1990. This piece is called \\"Vashishtha head\\", because the features, hairstyle, tilak and other features of the casting resembles the description for Vashishtha in Hindu texts. The significance of \\"Vasishtha head\\" is unclear because it was not found at an archaeological site, but in open Delhi market where it was scheduled to be remelted. Further, the head had an inscription of \\"Narayana\\" suggesting that the item was produced in a much later millennium. The item, states Edwin Bryant, likely was re-cast and produced from an ancient pre-2800 BCE copper item that left significant traces of matter with the observed C-14 dating.  Vashishtha Temples Vashisht village, Himachal Pradesh There is an Ashram dedicated to Vashishtha in Guwahati, India. This Ashram is situated close to Assam-Meghalaya border to the south of Guwahati city and is a major tourist attraction of Guwahati. Vashishtha's Temple is situated in Vashisht village, Himachal Pradesh. Vashishtha Cave, a cave on the banks of Ganges at Shivpuri, 18 km from Rishikesh is also locally believed to be his winter abode and houses a Shiva temple, also nearby is Arundhati Cave. Guru Vashishtha is also the primary deity at Arattupuzha Temple known as Arattupuzha Sree Dharmasastha in Arattupuzha village in Thrissur district of Kerala.

The trough could be rock-cut, wood-lined or clay-lined to ensure it was watertight. Radiocarbon dates vary quite widely, the earliest being late Neolithic, with clusters of dates between 1900–1500 BC and 1200–800 BC, with some outliers in the Iron Age. There are also some dates that go into the early Medieval period. The technology used at burnt mounds has much greater antiquity and is found from the palaeolithic onwards. Description and creation The shattered rock fragments are thought to be the remains of stones heated in fires, which were used to heat water. The shattering of the rock appears to have been the result of thermal shock when the heated stones were dropped into liquid, normally believed to be water. The mound is assumed to result from the periodic clearing out of the trough, with the stone fragments and charcoal being cast up into a mound. The mound is frequently a crescent shape, which is seen as being the result of the upcast. There has been considerable debate about the time required to create the mounds. Some interpretations posit the rapid accumulation of material, as a trough was used intensively and very frequently; others suggest a slower accumulation, where the trough was used occasionally over a long period of time. One thesis is that mounds were created at hunting sites; this explanation would most likely result in the latter pattern of accumulation, while the former would suggest that the use of the trough was for an essentially domestic purpose. Locations =Britain and Ireland= The vast majority of burnt mounds are found in the uplands of Britain, and in Ireland where they are called fulachtaí fia. Recognised from the nineteenth century onwards, they attracted little significant interest until the 1980s. In Ireland they are often found in low-lying ground close to water. In Britain, they appeared to have a distribution pattern confined to the higher ground. However, this may be illusory, as examples have been found at lower altitudes during linear route excavations. The reason that they had not been recognised before was that the mounds have been ploughed out, although the trough may partially survive and there will be layers of the burnt mound material surviving as a spread of material. The mixture of burnt and shattered rock with charcoal, labelled as burnt mound material, is found on occasion without the trough. There are settlement sites on Orkney, where the burnt mound material is found as thick layers , but there is no trough to explain the shattering of the rocks. The upland bias in distribution in Britain has led to a suggestion that they were cooking sites for hunting parties, and there are images from Medieval Irish texts that appear to show this. The burnt mounds are always adjacent to water courses, and there can be several instances along the same burn or stream. The implication found in many accounts of burnt mounds gives the impression that they are found in Ireland and Scotland, but they also are found in Wales and in England. The Welsh examples tend to be upland and rural, as are many of the English ones, but there are also many found in the lowlying English Midlands. =Other locations= Burnt mound material has also been found elsewhere in northwestern Europe, such as in Sweden and Switzerland. Possible purposes It is not necessarily the case that all burnt mound material must have been created for the same purposes, and it would be a mistake to seek a single explanation for all the examples of burnt mounds and burnt mound material. Similar material has been produced all over the world , and there may be a range of explanations. =Possible use for bathing= Barfield & Hodder interpreted burnt mounds as possibly places for bathing in heated water or steam, based on their discoveries of structures that could have involved tents and broken stones next to streams in the Birmingham area.*Birmingham City Council leaflet by planning archaeologist https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/new-discoveries-in-sutton-park.htm One example is in Moseley Bog where experiments were made in the late 1990s to assess the plausibility of the sauna hypothesis. A related thesis is that the hot stones were used to heat water in a large, rectangular pit lined with large, flat stones, and that the hot water could then be used for a variety of purposes - bathing being just one option. =Cooking= Burnt mounds are also hypothesized to have been used as cooking sites. There are descriptions of the use of such places for cooking in some of the early Medieval tales, although the historicity of these accounts is open to question. The process has been found to work; experiments were carried out in Ireland in the 1950s to show that a joint of meat could be fully cooked in about three to four hours through this method. However no burnt mounds have been found with any direct evidence of cooking. Bone is rarely if ever reported from burnt mound sites, which would be unusual for a cooking site. This has been explained as the result of the soils being too acidic for the bone to be preserved, but it would be unlikely that all of the soils relating to burnt mounds were so acidic that no bone survived, particularly as the pH of the soil will vary considerably from site to site, and there are also examples of burnt mounds that have been recorded on neutral or basic soils, without bone being apparent in the burnt mound material, In addition some mounds occur in places which are believed to have never been inhabited,https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/new-discoveries-in-sutton- park.htm but this may be explained as cooking by hunting parties or those who were outlawed from living near permanent settlements.Nagy, Joseph Falaky (1985). The Wisdom of the Outlaw - The Boyhood Deeds of Finn in Gaelic Narrative Tradition. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. =Other purposes= Several other purposes have been suggested. A possible non-domestic purpose is salt production. More domestic purpose suggestions are heating water for bathing, dyeing or leather treatment, fulling, and the making of ale.Fulacht_fiadh#Function See also * Fulacht fiadh References =Bibliography= ;Academic books * ;Academic articles External links *Tennessee Archaeology Net Bibliography Page - FCR (Fire- Cracked Rock) Bibliography *Prehistoric Birmingham - 3000 years old Burnt Mounds *Burnt mound in Fox Hollies Park, Birmingham *Burnt mounds in Woodlands Park, Birmingham *Burnt mounds at Moseley Bog, Birmingham Archaeological features Mounds ","title":"Burnt mound"},{"id":"5005499","title":"List of golf video games"},{"id":"5005505","text":"is a railway station in the city of Tagajō, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

He was also a victim of the Holocaust. Early life Seeler was born in the small, provincial town of Greifenberg in Pomerania, Germany (now Gryfice in northwestern Poland), to a Jewish family. He moved to Berlin at the age of 15. His first verses are said to have been published as early as 1917-1918; the first collection of poems, Dem Hirtenknaben, was issued in Berlin in 1919; another one, entitled Die Flut, saw the light of day in Vienna in 1937.Moriz Seeler, Die Flut: Gedichte (Vienna, Buchhandlung Richard Lányi, 1937). Biography He is perhaps best known as the founding father of the Junge Bühne (‘Young Stage’), an avant‑garde matinee-theatre which came into being in Berlin in the spring of 1922. In 1927 he co‑authored the libretto to Friedrich Hollaender’s cabaret Bei uns um die Gedächtniskirche rum. In June 1929 he co‑founded (together with Robert Siodmak and Edgar G. Ulmer) Filmstudio 1929, a Berlin production house. In 1929-1930 he co‑produced, together with Heinrich Nebenzahl, the silent quasi-documentary film Menschen am Sonntag, directed by Robert Siodmak (1900-1973) and starring Brigitte Borchert and Erwin Splettstößer, which shows a candid picture of life in Weimar-era Germany that was soon to vanish for ever. In 1998 a small book written about him by Günther Elbin, Am Sonntag in die Matinee, appeared in Germany.Günther Elbin, Am Sonntag in die Matinee: Moriz Seeler und die Junge Bühne: Eine Spurensuche (Mannheim, Persona-Verlag, 1998). Following this development, in November 2000, a memorial plaque was erected on the façade of the tenement at the Brandenburgische Straße 36 in what is now the Berlin borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, identifying the house as the locale where Moriz Seeler lived from 1916 to the mid‑1920s: the inscription refers to him as a ‘Jewish poet’, not a German one. In September 2002 a street, previously known as Franz‑Ehrlich-Straße, in another of the Berlin boroughs (that of Treptow-Köpenick), was renamed Moriz‑Seeler‑Straße in his honour. The capital of Austria has had a street named Moritz‑Seeler‑Gasse (sic: not Moriz) since 1969. His name is commonly spelt ‘Moritz Seeler’. Disappearance Having been imprisoned by the Nazis in November 1938, he is said to have been deported to Latvia, where he went missing in Riga, doubtless having fallen victim to the Nazis in one of that city's three Jewish ghettos (according to another account, he was murdered at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943 -- and this account, less well-known and less generally accepted, may well be the accurate one).

Name His full name was Muhammad Ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Shawkani.“Dogs in the Islamic Tradition and Nature” (Article Included) The surname \\"ash-Shawkani\\" is derived from Hijrah ash-Shawkan, which is a town outside San‘a’al-Badr at-Taali' bi Mahaasin man Ba'd al-Qarn as-Sabi' , vol. 2 pg.214 Biography Born into a Zaydi Shi'a Muslim family, ash-Shawkani later on adopted the ideology within Sunni Islam and called for a return to the textual sources of the Quran and hadith. As a result, he opposed much of the Zaydi doctrine. He also opposed Sufism. He is considered as a mujtahid, or authority to whom others in the Muslim community have to defer in details of religious law. Of his work issuing fatwas, ash- Shawkani stated \\"I acquired knowledge without a price and I wanted to give it thus.\\"cited in Messick, Brinkly The Calligraphic State:Textual Domination and History in a Muslim Society, Berkeley 1993, p.145 Part of the fatwa-issuing work of many noted scholars typically is devoted to the giving of ordinary opinions to private questioners. Ash-Shawkani refers both to his major fatwas, which were collected and preserved as a book, and to his \\"shorter\\" fatwas, which he said \\"could never be counted\\" and which were not recorded.cited in Messick, Brinkly The Calligraphic State:Textual Domination and History in a Muslim Society, Berkeley 1993, p.150 He is credited with developing a series of syllabi for attaining various ranks of scholarship and used a strict system of legal analysis based on Sunni thought. He insisted that the ulama were required to ask for textual evidence, that the gate of ijtihad was not closed and that the mujtahid was to do ijtihad independent of any maddhab, a view which stemmed from his opposition to taqlid for a mujtahid, which he deemed to be a vice with which the Shariah had been inflicted. Legacy Salafis in Saada, would later claim ash-Shawkani as an intellectual precursor, and future Yemeni regimes would uphold his Sunnization policies as a unifier of the country and to undermine Zaydi Shi'ism. Beyond Yemen, his works are widely used in Sunni schools. He also profoundly influenced the Ahl-i Hadith in the Indian subcontinent (such as Siddiq Hasan Khan) and Salafis in Saudi Arabia and across the globe.

Geography Sommières is to the south of the garrigues and on the edge of the Vaunage, a wine growing region. It straddles the River Vidourle. History The village first settled on the arcades of the Roman bridge on the Vidourle river, built by Roman Emperor Tiberius during the first century. The village grew in the protection of the castle. It was annexed into the French kingdom by King Louis IX in 1248, following the crusade against the Albigensiens. It became a Protestant stronghold, and it was besieged by the Catholics in 1573 and again by Louis XIII in 1622. = Siege of Sommières 1573 = The Fourth War of Religion (1562–98) started with the St Bartholomew's Day massacre and finished with the Edict of Nantes. The Catholic forces were trying to suppress the Huguenots in this one of their strongholds. Marshall Damville laid siege to Sommières for the second time on 11 February 1573, and the garrison held out 9 April, resisting the attackers with red hot iron and boiling oil. Though nominally a royal victory, the defenders were offered generous terms, including the right for the garrison to march out with full honours of war. The Siege of Sommières delayed the advance of the royal army by two months and is calculated to have cost them 2500 lives. Only 38 houses remained standing Rickard, J (9 February 2011), Siege of Sommières, 11 February-9 April 1573 , http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/siege_sommieres.html = Siege of Sommières 1622 = This time the Catholic king himself led the army. The siege was short. The town was back in Protestant hands in 1625 when the Protestant Duke of Rohan entered the city. He was to leave in haste and the Catholics were back. In 1703, Jean Cavalier the leader of the Camisards with a force of 800 men unsuccessfully attempted to take the city. The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes left the Protestants in a dangerous situation- and the Château at Sommières was used as to incarcerate them- along with English and Dutch sailors and women accused of prostitution.Sommières 2000 ans d'histoire... in French = Recent history = The town has always been prone to flooding, and as recently as 2002 the River Vidourle flooded, causing major damage to the town and properties along the bank. This time it washed out the Champion supermarket, which reopened at Villevieille in July 2008. In October 2008 this supermarket was rebranded Carrefour. The floods are called 'vidourlades'.Guide Michelin, Gorges du Tarn Cévennes Languedoc, 2nd edition 1994 Population Sights The village has a Roman bridge, a medieval centre, a fortified gate and the ruins of a castle. The Roman bridge is 190m long, it was built on the instructions of Emperor Tiberius at the start of the 1st century. It was restored in the 18th century.Structurae:The Bridge At the town end of the bridge is the gothic town gate known as the 'Tour de l'Horloge'. Only 7 of the 19 arches can be seen, the others lie beneath the town where they act as cellars. The ancient Roman road (Via Luteva) leads from the gate, along the Grande Rue to the 'Marché-Haut' or Place Jean Jaurès, the old wheat market. Here it turns left and leaves the town heading to Alès, and Nîmes. Economy Sommières used to be a centre for leather and linen.

While it is likely he is related to the later historian and general Thucydides, son of Olorus, the details are uncertain; maternal grandfather and grandson fits the available evidence. Life and political career Thucydides was born in the deme of Alopeke (Ἀλωπεκή) of Athens. The exact year of his birth is unknown, but his family was noble and he was a relative of Cimon, the charismatic general and leader of the conservative party. After Cimon's death, he succeeded him in the leadership of the conservatives and decided to exert a vehement opposition against Pericles, who was leading Athens at the time. Thucydides represented the thorough-going conservative party at Athens; their views are most clearly represented by \\"the Old Oligarch\\" in his Constitution of the Athenians, which has come down to us among the works of Xenophon.Donald Kagan, The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 138 Donald Kagan suggests that Thucydides' ultimate goal, which he could not state openly as doing so would alienate the pro-democratic majority, was to roll back the constitutional changes made by Ephialtes, reinstating the more aristocratic and conservative government that had prevailed in Cimon's day.Kagan, The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 136 Thucydides' political strength reached its peak in the wake of the First Peloponnesian War and the reorganization of the Athenian empire in the early 440s BC. Thucydides developed a new and effective political tactic by having his supporters sit together in the assembly, increasing their apparent strength and giving them a united voice.Plutarch, Pericles 11.2 Kagan asserts that this tactic helped Thucydides mount a concerted opposition to Pericles which brought to light ideological differences among Pericles' supporters. In 444 BC, the conservative and the democratic parties confronted each other in a fierce battle. Though some modern scholars doubte.g., A. Andrewes, \\"The Opposition to Pericles\\", Journal of Hellenic Studies 98 (1978): \\"These chapters of Plutarch [Pericles 11-12, 14] seem to me false to the feeling of mid-century Athens about the empire...; they are no good guide to the character or policy of Thucydides\\" (p. 5). the details of Plutarch's account, according to Plutarch, Thucydides, the new leader of the conservatives, accused Pericles, the leader of the democrats, of profligacy, criticizing the way Pericles spent the money for his ambitious building plan. Thucydides managed to incite the passions of the Athenian Assembly in his favor, but when Pericles took the floor, the atmosphere immediately changed. Pericles proposed to pay for all the construction from his own purse, under the term that all these monuments would belong to him and not to Athens. The public applauded his stance and Thucydides suffered an unexpected defeat from the charismatic orator.Plutarch, Pericles, XIV As a result of his failure in confronting Pericles, Thucydides was ostracized for ten years, in 442 BC, and Pericles once again stood unchallenged in the Athenian political arena. Plutarch relates that, when Thucydides was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus II, if he or Pericles was a better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was a better fighter, because, even when he is defeated, he achieves to convince the audience that he won.Encyclopedia The Helios (in Greek) After being ostracized, Thucydides is said to have traveled to Sybaris, a city of Magna Graecia on the Gulf of Taranto in Italy, or Aegina, but this is unconfirmed.Encyclopedia 21st Century, Volume 18, \\"Thucydides\\" (in Greek) Thucydides is mentioned in the \\"Wasps\\" by AristophanesLoeb Classical Library 488, page 344, as an example of a defendant who is silenced by the overwhelming power of his accuser's (Pericles') arguments. While in Athens, Thucydides is also said to have accused Pericles' personal friend, Anaxagoras, of atheism and sympathy for the Persians.Diogenes Laërtius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers II, 12 Notes References *Diogenes Laërtius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers *Encyclopedia 21st Century, Volume 18, \\"Thucydides\\" (in Greek) *Encyclopedia The Helios (in Greek) *Kagan, Donald.

The species is named after the French entomologist Charles Oberthür (1845–1924) who originally described it. Subspecies Subspecies include:Funet * Pyrgus armoricanus maroccanus Picard, 1950 (Algeria and Morocco) * Pyrgus armoricanus persicus (Reverdin, 1913) Distribution and habitat This species can be found throughout Europe although it is commoner in the south and absent from the British Isles and most of Scandinavia.Fauna europaea It is also present in Northwest Africa. These butterflies mainly inhabit hot grassy flowery meadows and in dry, rocky and herbaceous forests, at an elevation of above sea level. Description Pyrgus armoricanus has a wingspan of 24–28 mm. Both wings have a white fringe along the edges. The upperside of the forewings is dark brown with well developed white markings. On the recto of the hindwings there are clearly visible grayish marks. The underside of the hindwings shows a pale reddish-brown colour with a large pale discal spot and light coloured veins. The males and females are similar in appearance. Oberthür's grizzled skipper Like all Pyrgus species, it can be very difficult to identify in the field. The upperside of the forewings are often noticeably darker brown than other Pyrgus species, especially when fresh, with clear white markings. It resembles some smaller races of large grizzled skipper (P. alveus). It is slightly larger than Pyrgus malvae. This species is quite similar to Pyrgus carthami, Pyrgus alveus, Pyrgus serratulae and Pyrgus malvae. The eggs are yellowish, roundish and flattened, with numerous, strong longitudinal ribs. The caterpillars have strong short hairs. They are mostly dark brown to gray-brown, rarely greenish brown or reddish- brown with a black head. Pupae are strongly bluish-frosted with black dots and dashes on the back. Biology P. armoricanus flies in May and June with a second generation in the south of the range in August and September. Adults of this second generation are usually smaller than those of the first. The females lay their eggs individually on the underside of the leaves of host plants. In most of Europe the larva feeds on Potentilla species (Potentilla tabernaemontani, Potentilla reptans, Potentilla arenaria, Potentilla pedata) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca). In southern Scandinavia (Sweden and Denmark), however, the main larval food plant is Filipendula vulgaris and to some extent also Helianthemum nummularium.Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa The caterpillar overwinters.

Doctor Who  = Online content = In 2000, Goss was made a BBC senior content producer and put in charge of the BBC's official Doctor Who website. Originally the site was part of the BBC's Cult TV website. Goss slowly expanded the content to include Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Farscape, The Simpsons, 24 and Doctor Who. He was subsequently voted Number 19 in TV Cream's 2004 poll of Top 50 Media Movers and Shakers. With the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the Cult site was slowly wound down in order to concentrate solely on the show. Goss moved to BBC Wales to oversee the production of the new show's web site, expanding the contents to include cast and crew interviews, games and spin-off sites based on the broadcast episodes. His aim was to construct a whole world beyond the show that viewers could get further involved in, notably employing graphic designer Lee Binding for front pages and site design, and writer Joseph Lidster for the spin-off sites' fictional content. Sequence, a Cardiff-based design agency, were also responsible for all of the 2006 Doctor Who series games, experiences and many of the associated websites. Goss also produced the video clip \\"krill-loop\\" for a tie-in website. = Television, radio and DVD = Having produced previous Doctor Who web only animations (such as Scream of the Shalka) and Shada, in 2005 Goss produced the animations of two missing episodes of The Invasion. The animation, developed by Cosgrove Hall, was originally intended as web-only content but was later added to the DVD release and went on to be voted best DVD special feature in the 2006 Doctor Who Magazine awards. In 2006, Goss developed and produced The Infinite Quest, a Doctor Who animation shown on BBC One and CBBC in 2007. He was also producer of the special features for the DVD release. He has since produced DVD extra features for further 2 Entertain Doctor Who releases, including The Chase, The Keys of Marinus, The Masque of Mandragora, and The Trial Of A Time Lord. In 2006, he appeared in an episode of Doctor Who Confidential. In 2013 Scream of the Shalka was released on DVD with extras which include James Goss presenting a documentary on how the series came to be made and appearing in a documentary about the BBC cult website. He also produced a series of 5 (short) documentaries called Doctor Forever which appeared across Doctor Who DVD Special Edition releases in 2013. He was also involved in producing a series of documentaries for the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who which in 2013 were first shown on BBC America and subsequently on Watch in the UK. = Books = In 2007, he contributed to the Doctor Who short-story collection Short Trips: Snapshots. His first book, Almost Perfect, a tie-in to the Doctor Who spin-off series Torchwood, was released in October 2008 and was followed by two more Torchwood novels and Bad Blood, a novel based on the TV series Being Human. Goss's Dead Air, read by David Tennant, was voted 2010 Audiobook Of The Year. His Eleventh Doctor audiobook The Hounds of Artemis was given away free with a February 2011 issue of The Guardian. It is read by Matt Smith and Clare Corbett. His books Dead of Winter (Doctor Who) and First Born (Torchwood) were both nominated for the 2012 British Fantasy Society Awards. He has written numerous stories produced by Big Finish Productions in their Doctor Who related ranges. In 2013, BBC Books published Goss's short novel Summer Falls, purportedly written by Doctor Who character Amelia (Pond) Williams. In September 2014 his Twelfth Doctor novel Blood Cell was published. In addition to the three Torchwood novels and Doctor Who novels, James Goss is the co-author, with Steve Tribe, of The Dalek Handbook (2011), Doctor Who: A History of the Universe in 100 Objects (2012) and The Doctor: His Lives and Times (2013). In 2014 he contributed to The Shakespeare Notebooks. In 2015 his novel Haterz, about a man making the internet a better place one murder at a time, was published in the UK by Solaris Books and launched at the Forbidden Planet Megastore in London on 12 March 2015 with a book reading and signing by the author. In 2016 James Goss's novel, What She Does Next Will Astound You, which tied into Class, was published. Goss has written three novelisations based on Fourth Doctor stories by Douglas Adams. The first two, City of Death (2015) and The Pirate Planet (2017) were based on the serials of the same titles, which had not been adapted for the original Target Books series. (An abridged edition of City of Death was released in 2018 under the classic Target branding.) The third, Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen (2018) was based on an unproduced film script later reworked as Life, the Universe and Everything. An audiobook of The Pirate Planet has also been released, read by Jon Culshaw utilizing his well-known imitation of the Fourth Doctor.  Theatre  Goss's stage play Dirk, adapted with fellow student Arvind Ethan David from the Douglas Adams book Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, having been first performed (in its authorised form) in 1995, has been staged around the world.

It is not a disease or a syndrome, nor is it contagious or endemic. Instead, it is a generalized set of symptoms that may be applied to any species of tree suffering a wide range of different stressors. Norway maple, red maple and sugar maple are the species most commonly affected. The trouble often starts after insect-induced defoliation, which weakens the trees and makes them more susceptible to secondary pathogens. Early signs of decline include small or scorched foliage, and premature fall colors on some of a tree's branches. Later, dead twigs may become visible as signs of distress become evident throughout the crown. As the tree's condition deteriorates, whole branches die. The tree may attempt to compensate for its diminishing crown by producing leafy shoots on its trunk. The defoliation may occur early enough that the tree may produce new leaves in summer that do not harden off before the first frost. Fruiting bodies of bracket fungi may appear on the trunk or in the crown. Eventually, the whole tree dies. The process from first signs of trouble to total death may span anywhere from a few years to several decades. In urban areas decline is aggravated by soil compaction or disturbance, soil pollution (caused by discarded cigarettes, pet droppings, careless or malicious use of herbicides, and road salt), air pollution and unfavorable moisture conditions. In rural areas, maple decline is often attributed to soil acidification caused by acid rain. Soils which have developed from nutrient-poor parent materials such as sandstone, quartzite and granite are most sensitive to acidification. Fertile areas often show maple decline where large numbers of livestock such as cattle are allowed to roam in woodlots, as herds or flocks of livestock can compact a soil to a degree which is unfavorable to many of the trees. Carelessness with machinery or taps in sugar bushes is a frequent cause of decline in sugar maple and black maple. Unusual weather conditions can also lead to maple decline. A classic example occurred across southern Quebec in 1981 when an exceptional February thaw destroyed the snow cover. Later, hard frost penetrated the unprotected ground. The soil was still frozen when the growing season began. Widespread dieback was seen over the remainder of the decade. Subsequent experimentation has verified that trees in Quebec are more likely to show stunted growth and dieback where snow cover is prevented from developing over a winter.

He left school aged 14 and said that anything he learned afterwards was self-taught. He started publishing poems from the age of about 21 and he became co-editor of the now-defunct literary magazine Chanticleer with the Irish poet, Patrick Galvin, at around the same time. Shortly afterwards he started reviewing regularly for the Times Literary Supplement, mainly dealing with modern and 17th-century poetry. He listed among the prime influences on his work Dylan Thomas, Andrew Marvell and (\\"inevitably\\") W.H. Auden. More recently, as may be evident from some of his later poems, the more economical style of Ian Hamilton has been an influence. Meanwhile, in his more prosaic working life, he graduated from carpentry, via work on a travelling fair and a period dealing in antiques, to travel journalism; in fact he was founder-editor of the weekly Travelnews, a newspaper serving the travel industry. He published two small collections of verse in the mid to late 1950s: This and That (Fantasy Press 1955) and Errors of Observation (The School of Art, University of Reading 1957) and issue number 8 of The Poet magazine in 1954 was devoted entirely to his poems.

Biography He was born in Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) on September 23, 1840. He attended public school. He was the youngest son of Henry and Elizabeth Sorg, immigrants from Hesse-Darmstadt (or Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel), Germany. Paul Sorg moved with his parents and siblings to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1852 where he was apprenticed as an iron molder. He attended night school in Cincinnati. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War. In 1864 Paul J. Sorg met John Auer, a German-born tobacco roller in Cincinnati. Auer could make tobacco, but he couldn't keep books; for his part, Sorg knew nothing about tobacco, but he was a good bookkeeper. These two men organized a firm for the manufacture of tobaccos, starting a plant in Cincinnati. In 1869 they partnered with another tobacco firm in Cincinnati. One of the new partners lived in Middletown, Ohio and urged the newly formed company, Wilson, Sorg and Company, to relocate there and a new plant was constructed. Sorg and Auer soon sold their share of the business and immediately formed another company, P. J. Sorg Tobacco Co., to manufacture cut filler and plug tobacco. One of their brand names was \\"Biggest and Best.\\" This new firm they built up to become one of the largest of its type in the world and Sorg became Middletown's first multi-millionaire. Susan Jennie Gruver On July 20, 1876, he married Susan Jennie Gruver (1854–1930) in Middletown; they had two children, Paul Arthur Sorg (1878–1913) and Ada Gruver Sorg (1882–1956). In 1888, he completed a $1 million, 35-room stone Romanesque mansion that still stands in Middletown, converted to apartments at one time the mansion is currently under restoration by Mark and Traci Barnett and being converted back to a single family residence. Being a public-spirited man, he made many civic and charitable contributions to build up the city of his adoption, including the 1891 Sorg Opera House (designed by Samuel Hannaford) that is the performance center of Middletown's Sorg Opera. At a special election held in May 1894 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of George W. Houk, Paul Sorg was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-third congress from Ohio's Third district. He declined at first to accept renomination in 1894, in pique that a friend had not been appointed Consul to Berlin by President Grover Cleveland, to whose campaign Sorg had contributed generously. However, he relented and was narrowly re- elected to the Fifty-fourth in 1894 when the Republicans swept all but two seats of the Ohio delegation and two-thirds of Congress partly as a result of the Panic of 1893. He was the ranking member on the Committee on Labor. He declined a third election in 1896. James M. Cox, a Butler county native working as assistant telegraph and railroad editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer, went with Sorg to Washington as his executive secretary. A few years later, Cox held the same seat in Congress. After leaving Congress, he allowed his name to be put in nomination for Governor of Ohio at the July 1897 Democratic convention, but withdrew his name during the second ballot. He allowed efforts toward nomination again for the 1899 election, but these came to nothing when he became ill. Sorg resumed his former tobacco business activities in Middletown, forming a Tobacco Trust with Lorillard and Liggett until he sold the business to Continental Tobacco Company for $4.5 million in 1898. With the proceeds, he purchased in 1899 a paper company that had been the first paper mill in Middletown but had subsequently gone through several hands. He renamed the company, the Paul A. Sorg Paper Co., for his son who became president of the firm. Paul J. Sorg continued his business career as president of a bank in which he had invested in 1891. He also had real estate and railroad interests. His saw a future for the bicycle industry in its earliest beginnings, and he may have even foreseen the great war of the nations which was to come only a few years after his death, for his development of the Miami Cycle Company included, first, the introduction of its wheeled productions into every market, and second, the manufacture of shells and shrapnel which were immediately in demand by the United States government. Fully realizing the vital necessity of railroads to the growth of a western community, he was the chief instrument in securing for Middletown a branch of the great Panhandle System, known as the M. and C. Railroad. He was the good genius of Middleton at critical periods. When the Merchants' National Bank stood on the verge of failure, he purchased a controlling interest in its stocks and set the wheels in motion again, saving many depositors among his fellow townsmen from serious loss. He took charge of the affairs of the Middletown Gas Company at a critical period due to poor management, and brought it back to prosperity. He was appointed by Governor Asa S. Bushnell, a leader in trust-busting, to be a delegate to a national Conference on Trusts in 1899. The topic of discussion was to be \\"Trusts and Combinations, their uses and abuses—Railway, labor, industrial and commercial,\\" a subject on which Sorg could be said to be an expert. Paul John Sorg died in Middletown, Ohio, where he was interred in Woodside Cemetery. References * Taylor, William A. Ohio in Congress from 1803 to 1901.

They had a daughter, Laetitia Spetschinsky (born in 1976), who is now married to HE Didier Nagant de Deuxchaisnes, Ambassador of Belgium to Ethiopia, and mother of two sons (Charles-Albert (b. 2009) and Alexandre (b. 2013)) and a daughter (Louise (b. 2010)).

After her second divorce on 25 August 1987, she wed Prince Alexander, in Debenham, Suffolk, on 14 March 1991. They had been introduced in 1986 by former defence minister Léon Mundeleer. Alexander asked her to accompany him to the cinema. She vacillated initially, but they began to enjoy dining out together, Alexander being a gourmand, according to his future wife. The couple had no children together, and the marriage was kept secret until 1998, as reportedly the prince feared his mother would disapprove. Alexander's marriage contravened Article 85 of the Belgian constitution, which deprived of the right of succession to the throne any descendant of King Leopold I who marries without the sovereign's permission.  Career  In 2008, she published a book of photographs from the life of her husband and his family, titled Le Prince Alexandre de Belgique, because she felt that he was too little-known in Belgium.

During World War II, he was instrumental in developing the \\"hedgehog\\" antisubmarine warfare weapon and the degaussing method for protecting ships from naval mines.  Biography  Goodeve was born in Neepawa, Manitoba, the son of Frederick W. Goodeve, an Anglican clergyman. His early childhood was in Stonewall, Manitoba, but when he was around 10 years old the family moved to Winnipeg, where he grew up. He attended Kelvin High School and the University of Manitoba, passing his BSc exams in 1925 in chemistry and physics, and receiving an MSc electrochemistry in 1927. In that year he was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,1851 Royal Commission Archives to study at University College London, where he studied under Fred Donnan. Goodeve was appointed a lecturer in Physical Chemistry in 1930 and Reader in 1937. He was awarded the D.Sc. from the University of London in 1936 for his work with Donnan, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1940. After the war, Goodeve became the Director of the British Iron and Steel Research Association (B.I.S.R.A.). He was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1962. After retiring in 1969, Goodeve pursued his interest in operational research. In 1977 he appeared in the BBC Television series The Secret War episode \\"The Deadly Waves\\" where he recounted his work on the 'Double L Sweep'. Goodeve developed Parkinson's disease, which contributed to his death in 1980.  Work  = Naval service = While in Winnipeg, Goodeve had served in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve – . In England he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In 1936 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. In 1939, he began work at HMS Vernon, specializing in ways to counter the threat of mines. He developed the \\"Double L\\" technique for minesweeping magnetic mines. Later he developed the degaussing method for reducing the magnetic field around ships which triggered mines; Goodeve coined the term after the gauss unit, used by the Germans during the war to measure magnetic fields which they named after German scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). He also developed the related technique of \\"wiping\\". To aid the Dunkirk evacuation, the British \\"wiped\\" 400 ships in four days.PBS Nova \\"Great Escape at Dunkirk\\" https://www.pbs.org/video/great-escape-at-dunkirk-qb5qcr/ In 1940, Goodeve implemented the British production of the Swiss-designed Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, which was needed as anti-aircraft protection on naval and merchant ships. His group, renamed the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (D.M.W.D.), then worked on antisubmarine warfare developing the hedgehog, an array of spigot mortars which threw small, contact-fused bombs ahead of a ship. At one point, to protect the project from internecine warfare inside the Royal Navy, Goodeve finagled a demonstration of a prototype for Prime Minister Winston Churchill. By the end of the war the weapon had accounted for some fifty U-boats. For his work in weapon development, Goodeve was awarded an O.B.E. In 1942, the Third Sea Lord, Vice Admiral Sir William Wake-Walker, appointed Goodeve Assistant Controller Research and Development, with broad oversight of the Navy's research and development efforts. At the end of the war, Goodeve was knighted, and awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom.  References   External links  * Biography by The Naval Museum of Manitoba * Biography by F. D.

The land was located in Knox County, Tennessee from what is now Chilhowee Park to the Wooddale area, where he built a house. It still stands at 7703 Strawberry Plains Pike (called the Alexander McMillan House). He was one of the county's largest landowners. Wren Building, College of William & Mary. With a construction history dating back to 1695, it is part of the college's ancient campus. Staunch Christians, they wanted their son to be a minister and sent him to college early in life. He studied higher philosophy and exact sciences at College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia in 1775. The first in his class, he graduated during the Revolutionary War. Between 1776 and 1787, McMillan worked on a farm and studied. He studied law. McMillan graduated from Mount Zion College, Winnsboro, South Carolina in November 1787. He read about John Cleves Symmes’s Trenton Prospectus about the Northwest Territory and decided to purchase a lot between the Little and Great Miami Rivers. Career Replica of a flatboat that delivered pioneers to the three settlements: Columbia, Losantiville, and North Bend that would become Cincinnati. He was among the Ohio River survey party of 1787 with Israel Ludlow. He was admitted to the bar in 1788. In December 1788, he was among the initial group that traveled from Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky) to arrive at a site across from Licking River in December 1788. Originally named, Losantiville, the town was laid out by Ludlow and McMillan and other men built three or four log cabins along the Ohio River on Front Street. They hunted and fished for food. He had an assigned lot within the town by January 7, 1789. Initially, the town had no laws or codes for behavior, and behavior among the residents became unruly. McMillan was elected chairman to develop a code of by-laws and punishments for offences. John Ludlow was made sheriff and McMillan the judge. That year, McMillan received life-long injuries after four soldiers burst into his cabin on Front Street. He beat all four men from Fort Washington who were mad that McMillan had been made judge. McMillan began to practice law in 1789. In 1790, he became the first justice of the Court of General Quarter Sessions and became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. Most of the cases were slander, petty stealing, drunkenness, fighting, selling liquor illegally and illegally shooting guns. He married two couples in Cincinnati in 1790. With Ludlow, Governor Arthur St. Clair, and Jonathan Dayton, he planned the town of Dayton, Ohio in 1795. He was the County Commissioner for Hamilton County, Ohio from 1796 to 1797. McMillan served with Captain Robert Benham as Hamilton County Commissioners before both were elected to the Territorial House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800. He was elected to the Sixth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William H. Harrison He served from November 24, 1800 to March 3, 1801. He was the first delegate to represent the Northwest Territory in Congress. He declined renomination in 1800. After the admission of Ohio into the Union in 1803 he was appointed United States District Attorney for Ohio, but owing to declining health did not assume the duties. The offer, dated January 12, 1802, for the position was written by President Thomas Jefferson and was countersigned by Secretary of State James Madison. Personal life alt=Fort Washington is off of Broadway. The next street to the west is Sycamore Street, then Main Street. McMillan married a woman, Constance Zenes, who was previously married. She arrived in the settlement by 1789. In 1797 he acquired 120 acres where he built a hewn log house. The house was located at the Corryville Triangle Park near McMillan and Auburn Streets. It was the first house built in Corryville. On April 8, 1795, McMillan joined the Nova Caesarea Harmony Lodge No. 2 of Cincinnati and was a Senior Warden of the Lodge from 1798-1789. He died in Cincinnati, Ohio, in May 1804. He was buried first in Avondale, and 25 years later his remains were moved to Spring Grove Cemetery. In his will, McMillan left the land for the Nova Caesarea Harmony Lodge No. 2., a Masonic lodge in Ohio. A monument was installed with a plaque honoring McMillan by the Masonic Lodge. McMillan Street in Cincinnati is named for him. Notes References Sources *Bloom, Jo Tice. \\"The Congressional Delegates from the Northwest Territory.\\" Old Northwest 3 (1977): 3-21.

In the Miskito language the word Pantasma means small humans or flat head. The Spanish word Fantasma (Galego: Pantasma) origins from the Greek Phantasma and means ghost. The Valle de Pantasma, also called the \\"Crater of Pantasma\\", is a circular valley over 12 km in diameter situated in Nicaragua. It is passed by the Rio Pantasma, a tributary of the Rio Coco (also called Rio Segovia). In its center lies the village of Las Praderas, the principal place of the community of Santa Maria de Pantasma with about 40,000 inhabitants in the province of Jinotega. In the poor, but fertile and agricultural intensely used valley corn, grain, fruit, and coffee are cultivated and cattle is bred. The town is the site of one of the most famous actions of the civil war between the Sandinista government and the rebel Contras. On October 18, 1983, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force's Task Force Diriangén, under Comandante \\"Mike Lima,\\" launched a surprise attack on the town, overrunning a battalion headquarters, detonating a munitions depot, robbing a state bank, and destroying a police station, a school, and all other government offices and facilities, leaving 47 defenders and residents dead. Though a military success, politically the Sandinistas depicted the assault as a \\"massacre\\" and a symbol of rebel atrocities. Impact crater hypothesis Some have speculated that the crater at Pantasma was formed when an over 500 m large meteorite struck into the Tertiary effusive layers of the volcanic mountains in the north of Nicaragua. The circular shape of the crater, the skew of its floor according to the spacious mountain slope and its apparently arbitrary situation supports the thesis of a meteorite impact. A central uplift is missing or may already be covered with sediments. An ejection ring is not recognizable clearly in the rough landscape. The size and the shape of the crater are similar to the 10 km large and about one million years old crater of Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana. Its embedding into the landscape is nearly identical to the impact crater of Goat Paddock in Australia (5 km, up to 50 million years). The volcanic history of the whole region and the neighbourhood of an active volcanic zone suggest a volcanic origin, but don't prove it conclusively. A search for typical impact material (shatter cones, suevites, tektites), that could prove an impact event, has yet to take place. Based on available observations and data, this site is listed as improbable, or unlikely to be an impact site. But in spite of this an expedition by the Nicaraguan Scientific Association of Astronomers and Astrophysicists (Astronic) to the Pantasma Valley in July 2009 has provided some support for the impact hypothesis. Note: The Pantasma valley can not be \\"Triassic\\" (250 to 200 Ma) because it lies on the Caribbean Plate, that was formed between 140 and 70 million years ago. The fresh look of the crater suggests an age of only up to 1 million years. In 2010, geologist Jean H. Cornec from Denver, Colorado reported the detection of a new tektite strewn field (about 800,000 years old) in western Belize, 300 miles north-west, which could be related to the possible Pantasma crater.

During his reign, the balance of power among the Three Kingdoms began to shift, as Goguryeo attacked Baekje, and allied with Silla.  Background and rise to the throne  He was the son of the 16th king Gogugwon, who was killed by prince and future Baekje king Geungusu in the latter's assault on Pyongyang Castle. Gogugyang was also the younger brother of the 17th king Sosurim, and the father of the 19th king Gwanggaeto the Great. Gogugyang rose to the throne when Sosurim died without a son.  Reign  In the second year of his reign, Gogukyang sent 40,000 troops to attack the Chinese state of Later Yan in the Liaodong Peninsula. The Goguryeo army captured Liaodong and Xuantu, and took 10,000 prisoners. In 386, the prince Go Dam-deok, the later King Gwanggaeto the Great, was designated heir to the throne. It is said Dam-deok served his father in battlefields since he was teenager. Goguryeo attacked the southern Korean kingdom of Baekje in 386, which returned the attacks in 389 and 390. In the spring of 391, Goguryeo signed a treaty of friendship with King Naemul of Silla, another of the Three Kingdoms, and received Naemul's nephew Kim Sil-seong as a hostage.  Death and succession He furthered the formal state adoption of Confucianism and Buddhism, building a national temple and repairing the ancestral shrine. Especially, the ancestral shrine of Sajik-dan was constructed by incorporating Chinese-style rituals, while the temples of land and water were said to be constructed with a view to encouraging the commoners to have religious faith. He died in his eighth year on the throne, in the fifth lunar month of 391. He was given the posthumous name of Gogugyang.

He was a significant figure in Estonian religious philosophy. Masing also wrote poetry, mostly on religious issues. Masing authored one novel, Rapanui vabastamine ehk Kajakad jumalate kalmistul (Liberation of Rapanui, or Seagulls at the Cemetery of Gods) in the late 1930s, which was published posthumously in 1989. As a folklorist, he was a distinguished researcher of fairy tales, contributing to the international Encyclopedia of the Folktale. He was awarded the Righteous Among The Nations by Yad Vashem and the Israeli Supreme Court for his participation during the Holocaust in helping a Jew in Estonia escape capture from 1941 until the end of the war. His actions exposed him to great danger during this period requiring him to meet with his friend as well as lying to the Gestapo. Early life Masing was born in Lipa village, Raikküla Parish, Rapla County, on 11 August 1909 as Hugo Albert Masing. His parents were Ado Masing and Anna Masing. He had one sibling, a younger sister named Agnes Masing (married surname, Saag) born in 1911. A gifted polyglot, he was able to speak four languages by the end of secondary school and forty by the end of his life. He started to study theology at the University of Tartu in 1926. During his time there and after the graduation he published numerous poems, translations, and essays. His most famous work was in 1935 with the publication of Promontories into the Gulf of Rains (Estonian: Neemed vihmade lahte). Masing was a member of the influential group of Estonian poets brought together in 1938 by literary scholar Ants Oras, who was greatly influenced by T. S. Eliot. The small circle of poets became known as Arbujad (\\"Soothsayers\\") and included Heiti Talvik, Betti Alver, Paul Viiding, Mart Raud, Bernard Kangro, August Sang and Kersti Merilaas. At his peak Masing was able to speak around 65 languages with the ability to translate from 20 of them. He was known for his ability to translate straight from original Hebrew, occidental European and oriental languages into Estonian. Such was his prolific nature it is estimated over 10,000 pages of his manuscripts have yet to be published. Masing was known for his anti-German sentiment, that was the core of what at times was Masing's general dislike of the Indo-European people (whom he sometimes called 'ethnic garbage' and referred to as Indo-Germanic people). Righteous Among the Nations award Uku and Eha Masing's tree, planted by Yad Vashem in recognition of the Masings being \\"Righteous Among the Nations.\\" Masing lectured at the University of Tartu in Estonia, where he was known as a brilliant teacher of theology and Semitic languages, if somewhat eccentric. After the German invasion of Estonia in World War II he gave up his teaching post at the university and devoted his time to protecting and salvaging Jewish cultural and religious items. Masing knew the Jewish folklorist, narrative researcher and theologian Isidor Levin from his teaching days, and decided to hide him from the Germans who most certainly would have brought him to death. Masing and his wife Eha helped Levin evade capture by supplying him with food, shelter, clothing and even forged documents, while on occasions lying to the Gestapo about knowledge of Isidor. For these actions, Masing and his wife were honoured as Righteous Among the Nations.The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust By Sir Martin Gilbert; P.31 After the war, Masing also took part in investigating Nazi war crimes, in particular the Klooga concentration camp where many Jews had been killed.

He was the son of King Gogugwon. Background and Rise to the throne Born as Go Gu-Bu, King Sosurim was the first son and successor of King Gogugwon. He assisted his father in leading the country and strengthening royal authority, which had been severely weakened due to humiliation brought upon by the Later Yan, who dug up the grave of King Micheon. Prince Gu-Bu was made crown prince in 355. Reign He became king in 371 when his father King Gogugwon was killed by the Baekje King Geunchogo's assault on Pyongyang Castle. Sosurim is considered to have strengthened the centralization of authority in Goguryeo, by establishing state religious institutions to transcend tribal factionalism. The development of centralized government system was largely attributed to reconciliation policy of Sosurim with its southern opponent, Baekje. In 372, he received Buddhism through travelling monks of Former Qin and built temples to house them. It is said the king of Former Qin during Sixteen Kingdoms period sent Monk Sundo with images and scriptures of Buddha and; Monk Ado, native Goguryeo returned two years later. Under full-pledged support of royal family, it is said the first temple, Heungguk monastery of Korean kingdoms was supposedly constructed around the capital. Though there are several evidences that Buddhism was established before the year of 372 such as mid-4th century mausoleum styles under the Buddhist influence, it is well accepted that Sosurim consolidated Buddhist footprints not only on Korean people’s spiritual world but also in terms of bureaucracy systems and ideology. The year 372 held its critical importance in Korean history not only for Buddhism but also for Confucianism and Daoism. Sosurim also established the Confucian institutions of Taehak (태학, 太學) to educate the children of the nobility. In 373, he promulgated a code of laws called (율령, 律令) which stimulated the institutionalized law systems including penal codes and codified regional customs. In 374, 375, and 376, he attacked the Korean kingdom of Baekje to the south, and in 378 was attacked by the Khitan from the north. He died in 384 and was buried in Sosurim, which was probably a forest around its second capital, Gungnae. Legacy Most of King Sosurim's reign and life was spent trying to keep Goguryeo under control and also strengthening royal authority. Although he was not able to avenge the death of his father and previous Goguryeo ruler, King Gogugwon, he did play a major role in setting up the foundations that made the great conquests of his nephew and later ruler of Goguryeo, King Gwanggaeto the Great achieve reckless subjugations.

It was the first television channel in Austria, started in 1955. ORF 1 is one of four public TV channels in Austria. It is funded by a mixture of advertising revenue and television licence fees: as such, unlike the German TV stations (which are generally available free-to-air), ORF 1 and its sister channels are encrypted over satellite.  Programming  ORF 1 mainly shows films, TV series and sporting events; this is in contrast to ORF 2, which focuses more on news, documentaries and cultural programming. As the target audience of ORF 1 is younger than that of ORF 2, ORF's children's output, okidoki, is broadcast on ORF 1 every morning. Popular sporting events, such as skiing, Formula One and association football are also usually shown on ORF 1. ORF has exclusive rights to many sports; for example, it holds the rights to Formula One until 2020. In addition to the regular commentary, some sporting events, as well as some dramas, carry special commentary tracks for the visually impaired, via the Zweikanalton system. Until 9 April 2007, ORF's flagship news programme Zeit im Bild (The Times in Pictures) was broadcast at 7:30pm on both ORF 1 and ORF 2; as part of a major programme overhaul, this was replaced on ORF 1 with the soap opera Mitten im 8en. Due to poor ratings, the soap was short-lived and was replaced on 2 July 2007 by Malcolm in the Middle. To fill the void left by removing Zeit im Bild from ORF 1, two new news programmes entitled ZiB 20 and ZiB 24 were introduced; as their names suggest, they are broadcast at 8pm (20:00) and midnight (24:00) every night. In addition, short bulletins known as ZiB Flash are shown several times throughout the day. Feature films form a key part of the primetime output on ORF 1, and are shown several nights a week: many movie premieres are shown at the same time as on German broadcasters, but without the commercial interruptions that are commonplace on private German channels. Certain films and series are broadcast with both the German dub and the original (usually English) soundtrack via Zweikanalton (Two-channel sound). = Children= *Maya the Bee (Die Biene Maja) (2013–present) *Peg + Cat *Zig & Sharko = Entertainment = *Eurovision Song Contest = Information = *Zeit im Bild = Series = *9-1-1 (2018–present) *About a Boy (2018) *Altes Geld (2015, 2017) *Babylon Berlin (2018–present) *Desperate Housewives (2005-201?) *Devious Maids (Devious Maids - Schmutzige Geheimnisse) (2014, 2016-2017) *Ghost Whisperer (2007-201?) *Glee (2011–present) *Grey's Anatomy (2006–present) *Kupetzky (2006) *Last Man Standing (2014-2017) *Liar (2018) *Magda macht das schon!

The first broadcast was a ski race called The Nightrace in Schladming. A special HDTV event, introducing HD technology, was scheduled in all regional ORF stations right after. The technological partner for HD productions is Telekom Austria. Test operations began on 1 May 2008: ten days later, these were made available to any households with an ORF card showing a trailer. Those who could receive ORF 1 HD would see a trailer which showed excerpts from sports footage, films and documentaries. ORF 1 HD officially launched on 2 June 2008, five days before the start of 2008 UEFA European Football Championship. = Reception = ORF 1 HD is broadcast on Astra 19.2° east on 10,832 GHz horizontal (SR 22000, FEC 5/6). The channel is also available through Cable and IPTV. = Programming = Initially, the vast majority of programmes were upscaled, save for some sporting events, movie premieres and American television series. However, this has gradually increased; more and more of ORF's productions have been in HD, and many older copies of movies and TV series were re-sourced and replaced with HD scans; for example, older episodes of The Simpsons have been remastered in HD and, as of 2017, are broadcast in this format on ORF 1.  Parental guidance  ORF abridges some movies due to child-protection rules, but less often than German stations. ORF identifies its programs with initials: X (not suited for children; parential guidance advised), O (adults only), or with no initial. The sign K+ (recommended for children) is shown only on teletext.  Branding  From 1968 until 1992, ORF 1 prominently featured the red \\"ORF eye\\" logo in its television idents alongside several stylised number \\"1\\" logos. In 1992, the first version of the \\"green cube\\" ORF 1 logo was introduced, designed by Neville Brody. In 2000, ORF 1's logo was updated into a moving, soft-edged, gelatinous cube with the number 1 inside. This particular logo has been nicknamed \\"Jelli.\\" In 2005, there was another update to ORF's on-screen design: to avoid the logo being burnt in to plasma screens, it was changed from green to grey all-over. In 2010, it was announced that ORF 1 would be rebranded as \\"ORF eins\\" from 8 January 2011. On 26 April 2019, ORF eins was renamed back to ORF 1 with a brand new logo and on-screen design by design agency Bleed. = Logos = ORF1 logo.svg1992 - 2000 and August 2005 - 8 January 2011 ORF-1-Logo.svg2000 - 2005 ORF HD.svg2 June 2008 - 8 January 2011 ORFeins.svg8 January 2011 - 26 April 2019 ORFeins HD.svg8 January 2011 - 26 April 2019 ORF 1 2019.svg26 April 2019 – present References External links *ORF eins TV listings Television stations in Austria Television channels and stations established in 1955 1955 establishments in Austria ORF (broadcaster) ","title":"ORF 1"},{"id":"5006048","text":"Ralph Philip Thomas MC (10 August 1915 – 17 March 2001) was an English film director. He is perhaps best remembered for directing the Doctor series of films. His brother, Gerald Thomas, was also a film director, probably best remembered for the Carry On... film series, and his son is the Academy Award- winning film producer, Jeremy Thomas. He cast the actor James Robertson Justice in many of his films. Thomas often worked with the producer Betty E. Box, who was married to Carry On producer Peter Rogers. Thomas was a nephew of producer Victor Saville. Early career Born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, Thomas studied law at Middlesex University College. He entered the film business as a clapper boy at Shepperton Studios in 1932 during his summer vacation while at college. Following graduation, instead of becoming a lawyer he decided to enter the film industry, and became an apprentice at Shepperton Studios, working as a clapper boy and then in the editing room, the sound department and art department. From 1932 to 1934, Thomas worked predominantly on \\"quota quickies\\". He discovered he loved editing the most and worked predominantly as an editor for the next few years, including a period working alongside David Lean. When his employer, Premiere Stafford, went broke he worked for a while as a journalist at the Bristol Evening Post for over a year. He returned to editing before joining the army in 1939.Dixon, Wheeler W. \\"The Director as Journeyman\\" (Ralph Thomas interview, 3 February 1995), in Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-Century Cinema, SIU Press, 2001, pp. 105–17. During the Second World War, Thomas served with the 9th Lancers rising to the rank of Major and being awarded the Military Cross. He took part in the Battle of El Alamein.Dixon, p. 108. Post-war career Thomas left the army in 1945 and re-entered the film industry, although he could only gain work as an assistant editor. He assisted editing Odd Man Out (1946) then began making film trailers for the Rank Organisation. He worked his way up to becoming head of Rank's trailer department as well as writing films. Thomas later said making trailers was \\"enormously useful\\" because he \\"learned a lot of the technique of how the varying directors whose pictures I had worked on operated. Also, it teaches one a great deal of discipline about brevity in story telling\\".Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema (1997), p. 556. =Early films as director= Sydney Box had enjoyed Thomas's trailer for Miranda (1948) and when a position of director came up due to an unexpected illness, Thomas made his directoral debut in Once Upon a Dream (1949).Dixon, p. 109. He made a two more comedies for Sydney Box: Helter Skelter then Traveller's Joy (both also 1949). Thomas later recalled this time as: > Enormously exciting and invigorating. We knew that we were not always doing > very creative work, but that there was a chance to gain experience and that > this wasn't going to last... You were quite likely to finish shooting on > Friday, plan to go into the cutting rooms on Monday to look over your stuff > and get your cut ready, then go for a drink, and you'd be given another > script and be told, 'The sets are standing and you start on Monday – this is > the cast!' It wasn't necessarily good and we didn't get a lot of money, but > it was regular.McFarlane, p. 556. While assembling trailers, Thomas met Sydney Box's sister Betty, and the two of them struck up a rapport. In 1949 it was announced Betty Box, Muriel Box and Thomas had formed Feature Film Facilities, to make six or seven films, starting with an adaptation of several Guy de Maupassant stories. This never happened. However, when Thomas left Sydney Box to go under contract with the Rank Organisation to make The Clouded Yellow (1950), he brought Betty with him as a producer. They ended up making over twenty films together. Box defined their relationship in a 1973 interview: > I'm a natural pessimist and he's a natural optimist. I'm always in the > depths of despair and he is always full of joy. Good teams are often made of > opposites... We (she and Ralph Thomas) do have awful, boring fights. > Directing a film is not an easy job. For any man to stay sweet and gentle > through eight weeks of purgatory is impossible. Their second film together was Appointment with Venus (1951), a war comedy with David Niven. This was followed by Venetian Bird (1952), a thriller shot partly on location in Venice. Thomas then made several comedies, A Day to Remember (1953), The Dog and the Diamonds (also 1953) and Mad About Men (1954). It was a film released between the last two, however, which established his career. =Doctor in the House= They had a massive box office hit with Doctor in the House (1954). The film made a star of Dirk Bogarde and led to a number of sequels, all of which would be directed by Thomas. Thomas later reflected, \\"In a way it doesn't really do your career any good to have such a big success early on... you can easily get thrown off course because you get offered all sorts of things which you don't really want to do and shouldn't do. You become easily flattered because you like this first taste of fame.\\"McFarlane, p. 557. However, the films gave Thomas and Box a great deal of control. Thomas says whenever they made a \\"doctor\\" film, Rank would finance another movie they wanted \\"as long as the thing we wanted to make had a reasonable budget and was not too idiotic.\\"McFarlane, p. 558. Thomas made a war film, Above Us the Waves (1955), before doing a second \\"Doctor\\", Doctor at Sea (also 1955). Both these movies would be among the most successful films at the British box office in 1955. He followed them with the less popular Checkpoint (1956), a noir crime thriller concerning car racing starring Anthony Steel and featuring location filming in Europe. The success of Doctor in the House saw Thomas offered to direct the Cold War comedy, The Iron Petticoat with Bob Hope and Katharine Hepburn. The film was a financial success but production was an unhappy experience for Thomas. It was the only time he worked with major Hollywood stars. He returned to \\"Doctor\\" series with Doctor at Large (1957), the second most popular movie at the British box office in its year of release. This success encouraged Rank to finance Thomas and Box for a series of expensive adventure films starring Dirk Bogarde shot on location, aimed at the international market: Campbell's Kingdom (1957), A Tale of Two Cities (1958) and The Wind Cannot Read (also 1958). None of these achieved the financial success of the \\"Doctor\\" movies, although the last two in particular are regarded among Thomas' finest works. Also on a large scale was The 39 Steps (1959), starring Kenneth More in a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic, which was a box-office success. Thomas returned to comedy with the smaller budgeted Upstairs and Downstairs (also 1959), starring Michael Craig. =1960s= Thomas and Box wanted to make two riskier films, a story about nuns, Conspiracy of Hearts (1960), and a political story No Love for Johnnie (1961). Rank agreed to finance provided they made a fourth doctor film: Doctor in Love (1960) was the result; despite Dirk Bogarde refusing to take part (Michael Craig took over the lead), it was still a big hit. Conspiracy of Hearts was also highly successful. No Love for Johnnie was a flop, but was highly acclaimed critically – perhaps the most admired of all Thomas' movies.Dixon, p. 110. Thomas and Box then made two low-budget comedies. No My Darling Daughter (1961) and A Pair of Briefs (1962). Thomas did some uncredited work on Carry On Cruising (1962), before making a university drama with Box, The Wild and the Willing (1962), an \\"angry young man\\"-style melodrama which was the first film for Ian McShane, John Hurt and Samantha Eggar. None of these were particularly popular at the box office so Thomas returned to \\"doctor\\" films with Doctor in Distress (1963). This starred Dirk Bogarde, who had been encouraged to reprise his role as Simon Sparrow one more time. In return, Rank agreed to finance Thomas and Bogarde in two more expensive films: the James Bond spoof Hot Enough for June (1964) and a serious look at the Cyprus Emergency, The High Bright Sun (1964). Neither of the latter two were particularly popular. Thomas returned to more sure-fire material with a sixth \\"Doctor\\", Doctor in Clover (1966). He then made two Bulldog Drummond films, both starring Richard Johnson, Deadlier Than the Male (1967) and Some Girls Do (1969). In between he directed Rod Taylor in a poorly-received thriller, Nobody Runs Forever (also known as The High Commissioner, 1968). =1970s= Thomas shot the last \\"doctor\\" film, Doctor in Trouble in 1970. It made money but Thomas and Box were getting sick of the series and sold the franchise to television. They had a big hit Percy (1971) which led to a sequel, Percy's Progress (1974). However, other films Thomas made around this time – Quest for Love (1971), an unusual sci-fi love story starring Joan Collins, and The Love Ban (1973) – were less successful. The downturn in production in the British film industry of the 1970s affected Thomas' ability to raise finance for his films and he began to work increasingly in television. His last feature was A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (1979). He is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull. Legacy Thomas later described himself as: > A sort of journeyman picture maker and I was generally happy to make > anything I felt to be halfway respectable. So my volume of work was > enormous; I had a lot of energy and made all kinds of pictures. If you make > all kinds, you score a hit sometimes. I made thrillers, comedies, love > stories, war stories, one or two adventure things. Some filmmakers have a > lot of talent and genius for it; others simply have a lot of energy and I'm > afraid I belong in the latter category!Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of > British Cinema 1997 p 556 Filmography * Second Bureau (1936) – editor * Return of a Stranger (1937) – editor * Once Upon a Dream (1949) – director * Traveller's Joy (1949) – director * Helter Skelter (1949) – director * The Clouded Yellow (1951) – director * Appointment with Venus (1951) – director * Venetian Bird (1952) – director * A Day to Remember (1953) – director * The Dog and the Diamonds (1953) – director * Mad About Men (1954) – director * Doctor in the House (1954) – director * Above Us the Waves (1955) – director * Doctor at Sea (1955) – director * Checkpoint (1956) – director * The Iron Petticoat (1956) – director * Doctor at Large (1957) – director * Campbell's Kingdom (1957) – director * A Tale of Two Cities (1958) – director * The Wind Cannot Read (1958) – director * The 39 Steps (1959) – director * Upstairs and Downstairs (1959) – director * Conspiracy of Hearts (1960) – director * Doctor in Love (1960) – director * No Love for Johnnie (1961) – director * No My Darling Daughter (1961) – director * A Pair of Briefs (1962) – director * The Wild and the Willing (1962) – director * Doctor in Distress (1963) – director * Hot Enough for June (1964) – director * The High Bright Sun (1964) (US: McGuire, Go Home) – director * Doctor in Clover (1966) – director * Deadlier Than the Male (1967) – director * Nobody Runs Forever (1968) – director * Some Girls Do (1969) – director * Doctor in Trouble (1970) – director * Percy (1971) – director * Quest for Love (1971) – director * The Love Ban (1973) – director *Percy's Progress (1974) – director *The Insurance Man from Ingersoll (1975) (TV movie) – producer * A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (1979) – director *Doctor's Daughters (1981) (TV series) – writer * Pop Pirates (1984) – producer =Unfinished films= *Untitled film about British policewomen, a female version of The Blue Lamp *The Red Hot Ferrari *The Undertakers Man *The Reckless Years, the story of Byron and Shelley (1974)Box, p. 281.

It is a sequel to the 1993 film Devaasuram written by Ranjith. The film stars Mohanlal in the dual role of Mangalassery Neelakandan and M. N. Karthikeyan, father and son. Napoleon reprises the role of Neelakandan's archenemy Mundackal Shekharan. It also features Vasundhara Das, Innocent, Siddique, Revathi, Vijayaraghavan, and Saikumar. The plot follows M. N. Karthikeyan, Neelakandan's son and his attempts to reclaim their ancestral home Mangalassery tharavadu. The film features original songs composed by Suresh Peters and background score by C. Rajamani. Raavanaprabhu was released on 31 August 2001 during the time of Onam in Kerala. The film performed well at the box office, becoming the highest- grossing Malayalam film of the year. It won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value and Best Male Playback Singer for K. J. Yesudas, and also won Filmfare Award for Best Music Director – Malayalam for Peters. Plot First is shown the last part of 'Devasuram' where Mangalassery Neelakandan chops off Shekharan’s right hand. The story begins with Mangalassery Neelakandan's ('Neelan') son Karthikeyan, as he ventures out to make money which ultimately makes him a liquor baron as now Neelakandan has lost his wealth. The relationship between Neelan and Karthikeyan deteriorates, as the father does not approve of his son's money- making methods. Mundakkal Shekaran Nambiar comes into the picture again after spending a 9 year term in prison for killing one of Neelakandan's friends: Kunjananthan, decades ago on Neelakandan's and Bhanumathi's marriage day. He still carries the vengeance against Neelan for severing the former's right- hand years ago. Shekaran decides to finish the Mangalassery family by taking over the chairmanship of a debt-ridden Bank for confiscating the house which was kept as mortgage to the bank for the medical treatment of Bhanumathi: Neelan's wife and Karthikeyan's mother. Bhanumathi seeks treatment at Shekaran's Hospital. Even though Dr. Janaki: Shekaran's daughter, offers her the treatment she requires, Shekaran throws her out of the hospital, but Neelan reaches on time and issues a strong warning to Shekaran . Neelan tries to find her treatment elsewhere, but Bhanumathi passes away in her sleep. He is shattered. Karthikeyan is not able to reach on time to set her pyre on fire and he's now bent on taking revenge on Shekaran. He vandalises the hospital as his revenge. Neelan loses his home and Karthikeyan ventures out in an attempt to reclaim his ancestral home - where Bhanumathi was cremated and her eternal urn stands on the Mangalassery soil. He tries to acquire the house legally from an auction with the assistance of the State Home Minister and MLA Sivadasan (Kunjananthan's son and Karthikeyan's childhood friend), but Shekaran and his cunning nephew Mundakkal Rajendran, along with Rajendran's evil accomplice Maniyampra Purushothaman acquire it back using a faux concealed tender. As a last resort, Karthikeyan abducts Janaki in an attempt to blackmail Shekaran, and harbours her in his friend – Sakhtivel Gounder's house in Pollachi, where the Gounder family takes great care of her as their own daughter. It is during this period, Karthikeyan and Janaki fall in love with each other. Karthikeyan gets the Mangalassery House (Tharavadu) back when Shekaran strikes a compromise without the knowledge of Rajendran and Janaki's fiancé, Sreenivasan Nambiar IPS. Janaki is subsequently released. As a result of arguments between Janaki and Sreenivasan about her chastity while being in the custody of Karthikeyan, and she not giving a written statement to the police against him because of her liking towards Karthikeyan, the fixed marriage is called off by Janaki. Rajendran makes a last attempt to kill Karthikeyan, but instead kills Neelakandan by lighting him on fire, and gets killed by Neelan after a perfect knife throw, which decapitates Rajendran. Karthikeyan, now infuriated, goes to kill Shekaran by burning him. But the elderly Warrier stops him and brings him back. Shekaran realizes his mistakes, as well as the kindness of and the influence of Warrier on both Neelan and Karthikeyan (Warrier's shout prevented Neelakandan from killing Shekaran decades ago: in Devasuram). Karthikeyan becomes the head of his home, the soil where both his parents now sleep peacefully in eternity, and the IPS officer gives Janaki back to him, thus parting ways with the would-be couple on a happy note. Karthikeyan and Janaki are happily married with everyone's blessings.

Sanga is an honest and dedicated employee in the kingdom of Ramgarh, owing allegiance and loyalty to no one except Raja Laxman Singh. When Laxman Singh conditionally permits the British to use the port for trading purposes, Sangha finds out that the British are taking out gold and jewellery and bringing in ammunition, and puts a stop to this. He goes to report this outrage to Laxman Singh, only to find him stabbed to death. Sanga is charged with treason and of killing Laxman Singh. Sentenced to death, he escapes and forms a group of revolutionaries who have only one goal - to drive the British out of India.

Third party call control (referred to as 3pcc) is often used for operator services (where an operator creates a call that connects two participants together) and conferencing. Similarly, many SIP services are possible through third party call control. These include the traditional ones on the PSTN, but also new ones such as click-to-dial. Click-to-dial allows a user to click on a web page to speak to a customer service representative. The web server then creates a call between the user and a customer service representative. The call can be between two phones, a phone and an IP host, or two IP hosts. Third party call control is possible using only the mechanisms specified within RFC 3725[1]. Indeed, many different call flows are possible, each of which will work with SIP compliant user agents. However, there are benefits and drawbacks to each of these flows. The usage of third party call control also becomes more complex when aspects of the call utilize SIP extensions or optional features of SIP. In particular, the usage of RFC 3312 [2] (used for coupling of signaling to resource reservation) with third party call control is non- trivial, and is discussed in Section 9 of RFC 3725 [3]. Similarly, the usage of early media (where session data is exchanged before the call is accepted) with third party call control is not trivial; both of them specify the way in which user agents generate and respond to SDP, and it is not clear how to do both at the same time. This is discussed further in Section 8. Third Party Call Control is perfectly suited for delivery of 9-1-1 calls in a Next Generation 9-1-1 environment. It allows for re-connection of the media stream to an alternate end point if the original destination end point becomes unavailable without dropping the original emergency call (which has a separate media stream to the 3PCC server). Additionally, it minimizes bandwidth requirements between the 3PCC server and the emergency call handling end point because all mixed media uses the same RTP stream. Finally, it does not rely on a destination end point for end to end reliability but rather on a more robust centralized data center with several redundantly deployed servers.

The CSAP was designed to measure how well students are learning material from the Colorado Model Content Standards, the established content standards that all Colorado public school students should learn. The CSAP only tested four (mathematics, reading and writing, and science) of the thirteen subject areas in the Colorado Model Content Standards.  Administration  Starting in 3rd Grade, and continuing until 10th Grade (Sophomore year of High School), all students were expected to take their grade level's version of the CSAP, testing for which typically occurred during the Spring semester from early February to late March. All grades were tested in Reading, Writing, and Math, and only 5th, 8th, and 10th graders are tested in Science. The 3rd and 4th Grade versions of the CSAP are also available in Spanish to accommodate the high number of Spanish-speaking students in Colorado public schools who concurrently learn English. In 11th Grade (Junior year of High School) students were required to take the COACT (a Colorado specific version of the ACT) in place of the CSAP. The COACT is also administered by the Unit of Student Assessment.  Assessment  CSAP was graded on a scale of four proficiency/performance levels. Level 4 is referred to as \\"advanced,\\" level 3 as \\"proficient,\\" level 2 as \\"partially proficient,\\" and level 1 as \\"unsatisfactory.\\" The Colorado Department of Education website details their standards for each level on each test, and how each score is determined. Schools are rated by the averaged CSAP scores of their students. Low-scoring schools are eligible for School Improvement Plan assistance from the Colorado Department of Education. If a school receives an unsatisfactory rating (level 1) for two consecutive years it will be recommended it be turned into a charter school—unless it had an improvement of 0.5 of a point greater from the standard deviation over the immediately preceding year's overall standardized, weighted total score. Schools with three consecutive unsatisfactory ratings will be converted into charter schools. School districts with consistently low-scoring schools can lose their accreditation. = Exceptions = According to C.R.S. 22-7-409, schools are held accountable for the scores of all their students with three exceptions: (1) students transferring into the school after October 1, (2) students whose dominant language is not English for the first three years enrolled in Colorado public schools, (3) for any students taking the Colorado Student Assessment Program Alternate (CSAPA) instead of the CSAP. The CSAPA was a version of the CSAP test for students who met certain eligibility requirements, primarily students with disabilities. All School Improvement Plans must address the requirements in the No Child Left Behind Act Section 1116(a)(3)(A). Schools needing additional funding can apply for a Federal Title I A School Improvement Grant. The Colorado Department of Education provides a How-To document for this purpose on their website. = Funding implications = The No Child Left Behind Act has several other Federal Programs that Colorado schools can petition for aid if they qualify. In addition to the Title I A grant these programs include: Title I C - Migrant Education, Title I D - help for Neglected and delinquent children, Title II B - math and science partnership grants, Title II D - grants for enchanging education through technology, Title III - Language instruction for Limited-English Students, Title IV - Safe and Drug Free Schools, Title V A - Innovative Programs, Title V B - Public Charter Schools, and Title VI B - Rural Education Initiative. However, most Colorado LEAs (Local Educational Associations, e.g. Schools and School Districts) submit a Consolidated Federal Programs Application yearly which covers applications for Title I A, Title II A, Title II D, Title III, Title IV, Title V, and Title VI B programs. Funds received from these programs are distributed through the CDE to LEAs, and the amounts awarded for each State and Federal grant are published on the CDE website.  Relationship to other assessments  In addition to the CSAP, Colorado is also subject to the same requirements as the rest of the United States in the No Child Left Behind Act. The Colorado Department of Education's plans to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) are published on their website. Results from the CSAP, CSAPA, and graduations rates are used to create AYP calculations for Colorado school districts. The Unit of Student Assessment also administers the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to Colorado public school students. If a school is receiving a Title I grant and does not meet all the requirements of their AYP for two consecutive years in the same content area the school must create a School Improvement Plan. The school district is also required to provide transportation for students from the school not meeting their AYP to a higher performing school in the same district.  Replacement by TCAP  The Colorado Student Assessment Program ended in year 2011 due to the expiration of its contract. The CSAP testing regiment has been replaced by the Colorado TCAP, or Transitional Colorado Assessment Program. This test had similar areas and format of examination, starting in the 2012 school year.

It consists of ministers who are chosen and led by the prime minister. The composition of the government must be approved by a vote of confidence in the Knesset (the Israeli parliament). Under Israeli law, the prime minister may dismiss members of the government, but must do so in writing, and new appointees must be approved by the Knesset. Most ministers lead ministries, though some are ministers without portfolio. Most ministers are members of the Knesset, though only the Prime Minister and the \\"designated acting prime minister\\" are required to be Knesset members. Some ministers are also called deputy and vice prime ministers. Unlike the designated acting prime minister, these roles have no statutory meanings. The government operates in accordance with the Basic Law. It meets on Sundays weekly in Jerusalem. There may be additional meetings if circumstances require it.  Use of terms  The body discussed in this article is referred to in Israeli official documents as the Government of Israel. This is in accordance to the normal translation of its Hebrew name, (, Memshala). In Israel, the term cabinet () is generally used for the State-Security Cabinet ( HaKabinet haMedini-Bitachoni), a smaller forum of cabinet members that decides on defense and foreign policy issues and may consist of up to half of the (full) cabinet members. Another term in use is the Kitchen Cabinet (, HaMitbahon, lit. \\"The kitchenette\\"), a collection of senior officials, or unofficial advisers to the Security Cabinet of Israel. Provisional and first governments of Israel The first government was the provisional government of Israel (HaMemshala HaZmanit) which governed from shortly before independence until the formation of the first formal government in March 1949 following the first Knesset elections in January that year. It was formed as the People's Administration (Minhelet HaAm) on 12 April 1948, in preparation for independence just over a month later. All its thirteen members were taken from Moetzet HaAm, the temporary legislative body set up at the same time. Current government The thirty-fifth government of Israel (Hebrew: מֶמְשֶׁלֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל הַשְׁלוֹשִׁים וְחָמֵשׁ, Mem'shelet Yisra'el HaShloshim VeHamesh) is the current government of Israel, which was sworn in on 17 May 2020. It was expected to be established following the April 2019 election, but after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unable to form a government, the Knesset dissolved itself, setting up a snap election that took place on 17 September 2019. Again no one was able to form a government, and another election took place on 2 March 2020. On 20 April 2020, an agreement was reached between Netanyahu and MK Benny Gantz on the formation of a national unity government deal.

He spent a number of years at the end of his life as an agent of New France among the Miami. Vincennes was born in Quebec on 19 January 1668. His father, tanner François Byssot de la Rivière, was granted a seigniory for his tannery on the St. Lawrence River in 1672. Later, he became a ward of his brother-in-law, Louis Joliet, who entered him in the seminary at Quebec. Vincennes married Marguerite Forestier in Montreal in 1696. They had four daughters and three sons, including François-Marie. Through the efforts of his godfather, Jean Baptiste Talon, he secured a commission as ensign in the French marine. In 1696, the Comte de Frontenac appointed him as commander of the French outposts southeast of Lake Michigan (in present-day northeastern Indiana). Here he became good friends with the Miami people, settling first at the St. Joseph River, and, in 1704, establishing a trading post and fort at Kekionga, the location of present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana. The same year, the current governor-general of New France, Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, wrote the French court to emphasize the importance of Bissot's services to New France among the Miami people. In 1712, Vincennes served as second in command at Fort Detroit. In this position, he resided with the Miami to keep them from falling under the control of the British. He helped defeat the forces of the Fox Nation and acquired a young Fox slave, whom he named François-Michel. This slave eventually was owned by his son, François-Marie Bissot.Brett Rushforth, \\"Slavery, the Fox Wars, and the Limits of Alliance,\\" William and Mary Quarterly 63 (January 2005), No.1, para. 32.

In the event known as Black May, hundreds of people are believed to have died when soldiers opened fire on unarmed students and demonstrators during the protests. Further escalation was avoided by the intervention of King Bhumibol. Suchinda resigned from the Premiership on 24 May 1992.

Deakin College has been in partnership with Deakin University since 1996. Since then, over 15,000 students have successfully transitioned from Deakin College to Deakin University. The College offers courses in the areas of commerce, computing, engineering, health sciences, management, media and communication, and science. These courses are direct pathways to over 40 Bachelor degrees at Deakin University. All courses are conducted on Deakin University campuses at either the Melbourne Burwood, Geelong Waterfront or Geelong Waurn Ponds campus. Intakes are available three times over a year (March, June and October). Deakin College provides the Foundation Program which is equivalent to year 12, and university-level diplomas in business, commerce, computing, engineering, health sciences, management, media and communication, and science. The institute offers a pathway to Deakin University for students who do not meet the entry requirements for Deakin University's courses or as a bridge between previous studies and university. The Diploma courses consist of 8 units which are equivalent to the first year of the Deakin University undergraduate degree. This means that once you successfully complete the Diploma and met all requirements, you’ll move into second year of the relevant university degree at Deakin University (conditions apply). The Postgraduate Qualifying Program (Business and Law) offered from 2008 to international students is a non-award program designed to provide a pathway to Deakin University's master's programs in business. History and philosophy The institute was established in September 1996 on Deakin University's Toorak Campus. At the time it was recognised to provide access to post secondary education for both Australian and international students who did not qualify for direct entry into university, but who, in the right circumstances, have the capacity and motivation to complete a degree program. The Melbourne Institute also allows students to complete their studies more flexibly, for example if they wish to fast track (eight months) their course rather than do a regular university length course (12 months). The Melbourne Institute is now established geographically at the Deakin Campus Burwood in Building la and the Geelong Campuses at Waurn Ponds in Building ka and waterfront in the Denny Laselles Building.

Mahadevan) (8 September 1913 – 5 May 1958) was a 20th-century Tamil writer, known for his witty and humorous stories.\\"Remembering a literary genius\\"\\" Human traits — Devan’s forte\\" Early life Devan was born in 1913 at Thiruvidaimarudur in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India, where he did his schooling. He came to Kumbakonam Government College to complete his B.A. degree. He worked as a school teacher for a year, before joining the popular Tamil weekly magazine, Ananda Vikatan in 1933. Devan's first foray into the world of writing was through the humorous short story \\"Mister Rajamani\\", written when he was in his twenties. Life as an editor Devan started as a Sub-Editor at Ananda Vikatan in 1933. After Kalki Krishnamurthy left Vikatan, worked as Managing Editor from 1942 to 1957. During this time, he wrote about 20 serials, more than 500 stories, articles and travelogues. A common feature in all his works was his gentle sense of humour. He was a very popular writer and stories abound of how, when a new issue of Ananda Vikatan came out, everyone in the family would fight to get hold of the copy first. Devan worked under famous writers like Kalki Krishnamurthy and S. S. Vasan. It was his wish that his stories get published as books, but sadly this did not happen in his lifetime, due to the nature of his contract with Vikatan. During this time, he also served as Chairman of the Tamil Writers' Guild twice, and helped to promote Tamil literature. Devan was the editor of Ananda Vikatan until his death in 1957. In his short life, he experimented with different types of writing – travelogues, detective novels, articles, short stories, travelogues, current affairs. Devan's books are a joy to read even today, when social values and techniques in fiction writing are so different. About ten of Devan's writings were also dramatised by several Tamil drama troupes, even during his lifetime. He himself wrote most of the dialogues for the plays. More recently, some of his works like Thuppariyum Sambu, Sriman Sudharsanam and Mister Vedhantham were made into television serials also. Only one of his novels, gOmathiyin kAdhalan, was made into a movie, starring T. R. Ramachandran and Savithri. Bibliography All of Devan's stories and travelogues were serialised in Ananda Vikatan (with, perhaps, one exception, 'Mythili' which was serialised in 'Naradar'). His writings are copyright of the Devan Endowments. Recently, many of Devan's works have been published by Alliance Publishers, Chennai, India. 'Kizakkup padhippagam' has also recently started publishing Devan's writings. One of his novels, Justice Jagannathan, has been translated into English.

In the late 460s BC, he oversaw reforms that diminished the power of the Areopagus, a traditional bastion of conservatism, and which are considered by many modern historians to mark the beginning of the \\"radical democracy\\" for which Athens would become famous. These powers included the scrutiny and control of office holders, and the judicial functions in state trials. He introduced pay for public officeholders, reduced the property qualifications for holding a public office, and created a new definition of citizenship.Morris & Raaflaaub, Democracy 2500: Questions and Challenges Ephialtes, however, would not live to participate in this new form of government for long. In 461 BC, he was assassinated, probably at the instigation of resentful oligarchs, and the political leadership of Athens passed to his deputy, Pericles. Early actions Ephialtes first appears in the historical record as the strategos commanding an Athenian fleet in the Aegean sea in 465 BC.\\"Ephialtes (4),\\" from The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, ed. Then, in 464 BC, an earthquake hit Sparta, causing a great deal of damage and indirectly resulting in the revolt of the helots. When the Spartans failed to remove the rebels from their base on Mount Ithome, in Messenia, they called for help from cities that were still part of the Hellenic League, an alliance formed in 481 BC against the Persians. The Spartans asked the Athenians for help due to the fact that Athenians had a reputation for being good at siege warfare. This spurred much debate among the Athenians as to how to respond. In August 463 BC, Ephialtes represented those who wished to refuse Sparta's request for military assistance in putting down a helot revolt.Unless otherwise noted, all details of this conflict are drawn from Plutarch, He stated that they must “let Sparta’s pride be trampled underfoot.” (Plutrach’s Cimon 16.8; Scott-Kilvert 1960) Cimon . Cimon, the most influential Athenian politician and general of the time, was strongly pro-Spartan and advocated sending assistance, arguing that Athenians \\"ought not to suffer Greece to be lamed, nor their own city to be deprived of her yoke-fellow.\\"Plutarch, Cimon ; Plutarch is quoting here from Ion of Chios. Ephialtes, meanwhile, argued that Sparta and Athens were natural rivals, and that Athens should rejoice at Sparta's misfortune rather than help the other city recover. Cimon, however, was victorious in the debate, and set out for Sparta with 4,000 hoplites.Kagan, The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 72 However, shortly after the Athenians arrived to help the “conservative and fundamentally xenophobic” Spartans, their assistance was turned down. Subsequently, harmony between Sparta and Athens was broken and Cimon was ostracized for his misjudgment. The end of Cimon's ascendancy resulted in the emergence of a more radical democratic movement led by Ephialtes Attack on the Areopagus At about this time, Ephialtes and his political allies began attacking the Areopagus, a council composed of former archons which was a traditionally conservative force. According to Aristotle and some modern historians, Athens had, since about 470 BC, been governed under an informal \\"Areopagite constitution\\", under the leadership of Cimon.Kagan, The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 64-5. See also Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, The Areopagus had already been losing prestige ever since 486 BC, since when archons were selected by lot. Ephialtes accelerated this process by prosecuting certain members for maladministration.Unless otherwise noted, all details of this campaign are drawn from Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Having thus weakened the prestige of the council, Ephialtes proposed and had passed in the popular assembly, a sweeping series of reforms which divided up the powers traditionally wielded by the Areopagus among the democratic council of the Boule, the ekklesia itself, and the popular courts. Ephialtes took away from the Areopagus their \\"additional powers, through which it had guardianship of the constitution.\\" The Areopagus merely remained a high court, in control of judging charges of murder and some religious matters. Some historians have argued that Cimon and his hoplites were still in the Peloponnese at the time of this proposal,Hignett, History of the Athenian Constitution, 341 while others have argued that the proposal followed his return.De Ste. Croix, The Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 179 Those who place the proposals during Cimon's absence suggest that he attempted to overturn them on his return, while those who believe he was present at the proposal believe that he opposed them in the initial debate. All agree that his resistance was doomed to failure by the fact that his hoplite force had just been rudely dismissed by the Spartans, an action which demolished the political standing of Cimon and other pro-Spartan Athenians.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 73-74 Death and legacy The success of Ephialtes' reforms was rapidly followed by the ostracism of Cimon, which left Ephialtes and his faction firmly in control of the state, although the fully fledged Athenian democracy of later years was not yet fully established; Ephialtes' reforms appear to have been only the first step in the democratic party's programme.Hignett, History of the Athenian Constitution, 217-18 Ephialtes, however, would not live to see the further development of this new form of government; In 461 BC, he was assassinated. The details of his assassination are unknown. However, there are several different theories to explain this event. The first source we have on Ephialtes himself and his death is Antiphon (5.68) written in 420 BC, which states that the identity of the murderer was unknown. “Thus those who murdered Ephialtes, one of your citizens, have never been discovered to this day, and if someone expected his associates to conjecture who were his [Ephialtes'] murderers, and if not, to be implicated in the murder, it would not have been fair to the associates. In addition, the murderers of Ephialtes did not desire to hide the body so there would be no danger of betraying the deed.” However 90 years later, Aristotle, in his Constitution of Athens 25.4, states that Aristodikos of Tanagra was the culprit. As the years progressed, more theories were established. A third idea is that Aristodikos of Tanagra was part of an oligarchic plot; his political ally Pericles would go on to complete the governmental transformation and lead Athens for several decades.Plutarch, Pericles, 10.6-7 Had Ephialtes been murdered by somebody outside the radical faction, scholar Robert W. Wallace reasons, the radicals would have made him a martyr and led a crusade to find the perpetrator. This didn't happen, so the murderer likely came from within Ephialtes' own faction. Robert W. Wallace, \\"Ephialtes and the Areopagus,\\" Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies XV (1974), pg. 269. Literary references The assassination of Ephialtes, and a subsequent murder investigation to find the men behind the plot, is the subject of an historical mystery novel, The Pericles Commission, by Gary Corby.

Description  Flowers It is a medium-sized deciduous tree, the largest North American species of willow, growing to tall, exceptionally up to , with a trunk diameter. The bark is dark brown to blackish, becoming fissured in older trees, and frequently forking near the base.Peattie, Donald Culross. Trees You Want to Know. Whitman Publishing Company, Racine, Wisconsin, 1934 The shoots are slender and variable in color from green to brown, yellow or purplish; they are (like the related European Salix fragilis) brittle at the base, snapping evenly at the branch junction if bent sharply. The foliage buds are long, with a single, pointed reddish-brown bud scale. The leaves are alternate, long, thin, long and broad, usually somewhat falcate, dark, shiny green on both sides or with a lighter green underside, with a finely serrated margin, a short petiole and a pair of small stipules. It is dioecious, with small, greenish yellow to yellow flowers borne on catkins long in early spring at the same time as the new leaves appear. The fruit is a capsule which splits open when mature to release the numerous minute, down-covered seeds. The leaves turn a lemon yellow in the fall. It is typically found along streams and in swamps.Tree Species of the World's Boreal Forests: Salix nigraTrees of the North Carolina Piedmont: Salix nigraNew Brunswick tree and shrub species of concern: Salix nigra Salix gooddingii (Goodding's willow) is sometimes included in S. nigra as a variety, as S. nigra var. vallicola Dudley; when included, this extends the species' range to western North America. However, the two are usually treated as distinct species. Another name occasionally used for black willow is \\"swamp willow\\", not to be confused with Salix myrtilloides (swamp willow).  Largest example  According to the National Register of Big Trees, the largest black willow tree in the US is in Hennepin, Minnesota. Its height is , circumference is and spread is . The Marlboro Tree, located in Marlboro Township, New Jersey is certified by the State of New Jersey as the largest known example of this tree in the state. It is about 152 years old and measures in height and in circumference. Five grown people must hold hands to fully encircle the tree.Marlboro Tree  Uses  Black willow roots are very bitter, and have been used as a substitute for quinine in the past. Ethnobotanical uses of black willow by various Native American tribes include basketry, and treatment of fever, headache, and coughs.http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Salix+nigra The bark of the tree contains salicylic acid, a chemical compound similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). The black willow is the only United States native species to be used as timber for a variety of different items. The black willow lumber is used in furniture and shipping containers. The largest production site for black willow timber was in Louisiana at its peak in the years of 1970. It may also be used as an environmental restorative. Swamp trees in general are, by necessity, good at surviving and thriving in areas where highly mobile environmental toxins are present. Black Willow is very resistant to herbivory and flooding and is also a fantastic erosion control tool. Thus, it is useful for any sort of marshland stabilization or restorative as long as the roots don't penetrate any clay liner that may be in place.S. Li, L. Martin, S. Pezeshki and F. Shields, \\"Responses of black willow (Salix nigra) cuttings to simulated herbivory and flooding\\", Acta Oecologica, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 173–180, 2005.Clemson University, \\"Salix nigra Marsh\\", /www.clemson.edu, 2016.

It fell after 28 days siege to Sir Charles Wilmot on 5 November 1600, who had the castle's garrison executed in the following days. One of the best examples of Anglo-Norman architecture in County Kerry, the castle has now been restored to some of its former glory. The castle is open to the public for tours on a daily basis. The castle became the property of the Hare family, the holders of the title of Earl of Listowel, after reverting away from the Fitzmaurices, Knights of Kerry. It is now a national monument. Today, the remnants of the castle include two of its four towers, which are joined by a heavy curtain wall, and the unusual feature of an arch below the battlements. Archaeological excavations and records of the castle reveal that it was originally of similar form to Bunratty Castle, Co. Clare. In 2005, restoration works were commenced by the Board of Public Works. The stonework has been cleaned by a team of expert craftsmen, while the upper section, which had become particularly distressed with the passing of time, has been restored and rendered waterproof. An external staircase, in keeping with the architecture of the structure has been erected to enable the public to access the upper stories. Another Anglo-Norman castle at Woodford, Listowel, was built in the post-1600 period by the Knight of Kerry. The Seanchaí Literary Centre, which is adjacently located in a Georgian town house, will help visitors learn more about the castle's history and, according to the center coordinator, Cara Trant, the entire project should be of significant value to Listowel as a tourist attraction.

History A drawing of the abandoned funicular tracks along the Muralha das Freiras in 1891 The original line was inaugurated on 3 June 1891. Almost exactly 2 years later, on 5 June 1893, there was an accident caused by excess velocity, and the funicular car was decommissioned. The former \\"House\\" of the funicular railway was by 1893 occupied by an atelier operated by sculptor Henrique Moreira. It was later remodelled to function as a meeting hall for local Jehovah's Witnesses. As part of a larger initiative to improve the transport infrastructure of Porto, a new funicular and station was inaugurated on 19 February 2004, following the same line as before. Architecture The funicular is situated along the wall of Freiras, running down a steep cliff between the quay at Guindais and Rua da Batalha (terminating at building of the Civil Governor). Owned and operated by the Porto Metro, the single-track funicular uses a central loop system that is long, allowing it to descend , with the upper situated within the passenger tunnel, with the markedly steep gradient in the section below the passing loop. Two vehicles run the course, with a capacity for 25 persons each, operating at a maximum speed of . Due to the difference in slope along the line, the cars have self-levelling platforms, allowing the car floor to maintain itself horizontal no matter the track incline.

The Clifford group can be generated solely by using CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates; and therefore stabilizer circuits can be constructed using only these gates. The reason for the speed up of quantum computers is not yet fully understood. The theorem proves that, for all quantum algorithms with a speed up that relies on entanglement which can be achieved with a CNOT and a Hadamard gate to produce entangled states, this kind of entanglement alone does not give any computing advantage. There exists a more efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits than the construction of the original publication with an implementation. The Gottesman-Knill theorem was published in a single author paper by Gottesman in which he credits Knill with the result through private communication.  Formal statement Theorem: A quantum circuit using only the following elements can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer: # Preparation of qubits in computational basis states, # Quantum gates from the Clifford group (Hadamard gates, controlled NOT gates, Phase Gate), and # Measurements in the computational basis. The Gottesman-Knill theorem shows that even some highly entangled states can be simulated efficiently. Several important types of quantum algorithms use only Clifford gates, most importantly the standard algorithms for entanglement purification and for quantum error correction.

Features  The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms were inspired by the Cordillera de Apaneca volcanic range *The coat of arms has the words (REPÚBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AMÉRICA CENTRAL) in a bold and Heavy, Sans Serif Boris Black Bloxx typeface, in a golden amber color *The nacional motto (DIOS UNIÓN LIBERTAD) in bold version of Trajan (typeface) Roman type Roman square capitals. The letter are colored amber gold on the civil flag, and black in the coat of arms *The date (15 DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1821) in bold version of Trajan (typeface) Roman type Roman square capitals The coat of arms of El Salvador has Medieval Gothic influences as well as geographical, biblical, and Native American Indigenous symbolic representations, all of which come together in a distinctive, stylized shield design. Its center consists of a golden amber triangle outline (symbolizing the three branches of the country's government - Executive, Legislative and Judiciary), in which a row of five green forested coned volcanoes \\"Soberbios Volcanes\\", depicting a lush tropical jungle landscape, rise out of the Turquoise (color) Pacific Ocean swells, symbolizing the fellowship of the five original isthmian member states of the United Provinces of Central America. The volcanoes are illuminated yellow on their right sides by sunshine. Above the volcanoes is a crimson red Phrygian cap on a staff before an amber sun surrounded by rays of Glory with a vortex of shooting spiraling swirling rays, and a volcanic \\"red sky at morning\\" under the sun in the horizon. The date of the Independence Day of El Salvador, 15 September 1821, is written in black letters around the sun. On the top, there is a rainbow arch, a biblical symbol of peace. Behind the coat of arms there are five cobalt blue and white striped flags representing the flags of the Federal Republic of Central America; one of those flags is risen straight up behind and over the triangle, hanging loosely around its spear, and the other four flags are risen half way and stretch out like wings from behind the triangle's sides, two on each side, one over another. The flags hang loosely on their sides, creating almost a horn-like effect with their ends tied up behind the triangle's bottom. All of the five flags are each held up and raised with Native American Indigenous wooden war spears, with obsidian Clovis projectile points, and tied with feathers, symbolizing El Salvador's American Indigenous ancestry and heritage. The spears represent the spirit and heroism of the Lenca and Pipil warriors, who defeated the first attempted Spanish conquest of Cuzcatlan. Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado wrote that he was awestruck and spooked in great fear when he saw the massive numbers of American Indigenous warriors with large spears and bows as their weaponry standing their ground in their battle against the invading Spaniards. Under the triangle, there is a golden amber scroll which states the national motto of El Salvador: Dios, Unión, Libertad (Spanish: \\"God, Union, Liberty\\") in boldface black capital letters. The triangle, flags, and scroll are surrounded by a green laurel wreath tied together with a cobalt blue and white striped ribbon representing the national flag, which symbolizes unity. The laurel wreath is divided into 14 different parts, which symbolize the 14 Departments, the Salvadoran subnational administrative units. All this is surrounded by golden amber letters, which form the Spanish words REPÚBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AMÉRICA CENTRAL (English: Republic of El Salvador in Central America) in boldface capital letters. For special occasions, the whole entire coat of arms of El Salvador is stylized bathed in amber gold or silver color. The coat of arms of El Salvador is recognizable in silhouette.

However, they have existed in Merseyside mythology for much longer and, along with the Treacle and Jam Butty Mines of Knotty Ash, had been referred to in the earlier act of another Liverpool comedian, Arthur Askey. When Ken Dodd began playing seaside resorts, he made famous his home area of Knotty Ash in Liverpool and popularised a miniature race of people who inhabited it. Diddy is an informal British word for \\"little\\". The Diddy Men were originally an unseen joke but after a while began to appear on stage with Dodd, delighting children in the audience. They also appeared in Dodd's BBC television programmes in the 1960s, as string-operated puppets. The Diddy Men tend to wear slightly oversized adult clothes in flamboyant style including tall furry hats. Diddy Men characters The Diddy Men include: Dicky Mint, Mick the Marmaliser, Stephen \\"Tich\\" Doyle, Little Evan, Hamish McDiddy, Nigel Ponsonby-Smallpiece, Nicky Nugget, Ben \\"Tiny Ween\\" Winston, Sid Short and Smarty Arty. Diminutive British disc jockey David Hamilton, who appeared regularly on Dodd's BBC shows, acquired the nickname 'Diddy David' which has stayed with him to this day. The original Mick the Marmaliser was the ten-year-old daughter of Little Jimmy, who appeared at the Blackpool Tower Circus with Charlie Cairoli and Paul. The Song of the Diddy Men The Diddy Men have a song, once released as a single, titled \\"The Song of the Diddy Men\\", sung in a high pitched, chipmunk style voice. It includes the chorus: \\"We are the Diddy Men, Doddy's dotty Diddy Men, We are the Diddy Men who come from Knotty Ash\\". Another song \\"Doddy's Diddy Party\\" featured the refrain - \\"tonight's the night the Diddy Men paint the town, we'll lose our blues, and let our Diddy hair down\\". There were several other songs including \\"Diddycombe Fair\\" - a spoof of the well-known West Country song \\"Widecombe Fair\\". Actors On stage the Diddy Men are normally played by children or adults with dwarfism. On TV and in some stage performances, Dodd used a ventriloquist's puppet of the Dicky Mint character. These days the Diddy Men are rarely seen outside pantomime season. Carol Vorderman, of Countdown fame, played a Diddy Man as a child.

It is a member of the Sumitomo Group. It is one of the three largest real estate developers in Japan, alongside Mitsubishi Estate and Mitsui Fudosan. As of 2018, it has the second- largest real estate portfolio in Japan (after Mitsubishi), with a total value of 5.7 trillion yen.  History  alt= Shinjuku Sumitomo Building in Nishi- Shinjuku, Tokyo alt=The company was founded as Izumi Real Estate Co., Ltd. in 1949 following the dissolution of the Sumitomo conglomerate. It adopted its current name in 1957. From the early 1960s, Sumitomo was active in developing and selling condominium properties. Sumitomo Realty held its initial public offering on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges in 1970. The company's first high-rise project was the Shinjuku Sumitomo Building, completed in 1974. This building became the company's head office. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest building in Tokyo (but was overtaken by the nearby Shinjuku Mitsui Building several months later), and its elevators were the fastest in the world. Sumitomo entered the real estate leasing and brokerage businesses in the late 1970s; commercial and residential leasing now accounts for the majority of its income. The company's headquarters moved to the 30-story Shinjuku NS Building (a Sumitomo-developed property) in 1982. Sumitomo actively invested in California and Hawaii real estate during the 1970s. In 1987, Sumitomo acquired the Tishman Building at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City, which it sold at a loss in 1998. In 1989, Sumitomo acquired the JW Marriott hotel in Century City, Los Angeles for $85 million. Sumitomo also set up subsidiaries in Washington, D.C. and Sydney during the 1980s. In the mid-1990s, Sumitomo began a home renovation and remodeling business known as Shinchiku Sokkurisan. Historically, Sumitomo has followed a policy of never selling the properties that it develops.  Notable properties  = Office towers = Sumitomo owns around 220 office buildings in Tokyo, most of which are located in the city's seven central wards.

It is a layer of the anterior abdominal wall. It is found deep to the Fascia of Camper and superficial to the external oblique muscle. Structure It is thinner and more membranous in character than the superficial fascia of Camper, and contains a considerable quantity of orange elastic fibers. It is loosely connected by areolar tissue to the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, but in the midline it is more intimately adherent to the linea alba and the pubic symphysis, and is prolonged on to the dorsum of the penis, forming the fundiform ligament; above, it is continuous with the superficial fascia over the rest of the trunk; inferiorly, it is continuous with Colles fascia of the perineum; however, it doesn't extend into the thigh as it just attaches to its fascia, which is known as fascia lata; medially and below, it is continued over the penis and spermatic cord to the scrotum, where it helps to form the dartos. From the scrotum it may be traced backward into continuity with the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perineum (superficial perineal fascia or fascia of Colles). In the female, it is continued into the labia majora and from there to the fascia of Colles. History It is named for Italian anatomist Antonio Scarpa. His description of the membranous superficial fascia is vague in his 1809 hernia monograph.A. Scarpa. Sull' ernie: memorie anatomico-chirurgiche. Milano, d. reale Stamperia, 1809; 2nd edition, 1820. Life-size illustrations included by Scarpa do not identify the layer even though some show all the other anatomical layers of the abdominal wall in the inguinal region. A probable description of the fascia is in the text which discusses femoral (called crural) hernia in the male. Scarpa describes that 'below the skin' we find 'a layer of condensed substance forming the second covering of the hernia' which adheres to 'the aponeurosis of the fascia lata'. A little later he describes this layer as being membranous and he believes it has a role in containing this particular herniation. In 1810, Abraham Colles described detailed methods of dissection to expose membranous superficial fascia in the lower abdomen and the inguino-perineal region including the penis and scrotum. Colles clearly associated the subcutaneous limitation of urine extravasation from a ruptured urethra with the attachments of the membranous superficial fascia to deeper structures. Clinical significance Scarpa's belief that the fascia stops hernias from forming is not thought to be true today. Some anatomists suggest the membranous superficial fascia is the scaffold which attaches the skin to the deeper structures so that the skin does not sag with gravity but still stretches as the body flexes or changes shape with exercise. The attachment of the fascia to deeper layers confines fluid which may have come from inside the body in certain diseases giving rise to clinical signs such as urethral disruption noticed by Colles and bruising in Cullen's sign or Grey Turner's sign.

It is found superficial to the fascia of Scarpa. Structure Superficial fascia is composed of two layers: the fatty outer layer, known as Camper's fascia, and the more membranous inner layer, called Scarpa's fascia. These parts of the superficial fascia are most prominent in the lower aspect of the abdominal wall below the level of the umbilicus. Camper's fascia is continuous inferiorly with the superficial fascia of the thigh. Medial and inferior to the pubic tubercle, in the male, Scarpa's fascia changes as it continues over the scrotum and forms Dartos tunic. This layer is highly infiltrated by elastic and smooth muscle fibers and contains a minimal amount of fat. Scarpa's fascia ends inferior to the inguinal ligament fusing with the fascia lata of the thigh. In the midline, just superior to the penis, Scarpa's fascia contributes to formation of the fundiform ligament of the penis.

Designed by Santiago Calatrava, it is one of three such bridges planned to be built over the Trinity; the second, the Margaret McDermott Bridge, is completed; the third cancelled. The span parallels the Ronald Kirk Bridge, a walking bridge that was previously the Continental Avenue bridge. History The bridge, which opened in March 2012, is the first of a series of bridges that the office of Santiago Calatrava designed to span the Trinity River in downtown Dallas. The bridge connects Spur 366 (Woodall Rodgers Freeway) in downtown to Singleton Boulevard in West Dallas. Construction on the bridge began in December 2005. The bridge cost $117 million to build.. Retrieved May 3, 2006 A Dallas Morning News analysis put the project's total cost at $182 million. Beginning in 2004, The Trinity Trust Foundation successfully worked to secure private funds in support of the Trinity River Corridor Project, including the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, Margaret McDermott Bridge, Ronald Kirk Bridge, trails and other components of the project. On June 26, 2010, the signature 40-story center-support arch was topped with a central curved span, which can now be seen from many miles away in several directions.(1) Dallas Morning News - \\"Dallas' Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge has its arch topped off\\".

On June 1, 2020 at approximately 9:00 PM, several hundred protesters marching on the bridge were arrested in a kettling maneuver when Dallas Police routed the protest onto the bridge, blocked in the demonstration on both sides, fired teargas and pepper balls into the nonviolent crowd, then detained all protesters on the bridge for several hours. On June 4, Dallas Police Chief U. Reneé Hall announced that the protesters would not be charged following several days of attention and backlash from community members, political figures, local news outlets, and activist groups. Architecture The cable-stayed bridge supports its length and main span with a steel arch whose peak's height is 400 feet (122 m). An array of twisting cables connect the underside of the arch's curved pylon to the bridge's platform. Fifty-eight (58) white strands descend from the arch and secure themselves along the centerline of the platform. The diameter support is composed of 25 individual segments, secured with of bolts and additional 450 tons (408,233 kg) of concrete. The bridge provides six lanes for vehicular traffic. The bridge closely resembles two of three bridges constructed in 2005-2006 above the Autostrada A1 motorway and connecting roads in Reggio Emilia, Italy, that Calatrava had earlier designed.(1) (2) In 2009, the European Convention for Constructional Steelwork gave the two bridges a European Steel Design Award, stating that the structures' original visual effects at different angles give the bridges \\"the aspect of huge musical instruments.\\" Gallery File:Margaret_Hunt_Hill_Bridge_Construction_-_March_2010.jpgConstruction in March 2010 File:Arch MHH Bridge 02.JPGConstruction in July 2010 File:Skyline of Dallas.PNGMargaret Hunt Hill Bridge with Dallas skyline in background (May 2014) File:View from Reunion Tower August 2015 23.jpgMargaret Hunt Hill Bridge as seen from the Reunion Tower (August 2015) File:Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge.jpgMargaret Hunt Hill Bridge in March 2020 References Further reading * Bridges in Dallas Road bridges in Texas Bridges completed in 2012 Bridges by Santiago Calatrava Cable-stayed bridges in the United States Neo-futurism architecture Transportation in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex Steel bridges in the United States ","title":"Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge"},{"id":"5006526","text":"Star Flyer () is a carousel-meets-watchtower style amusement ride in Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen, Denmark.

It was the most successful of Verstovsky's six operas, and its popularity even overshadowed Glinka’s two operas. It is a romantic opera with spoken dialogue, influenced by Weber's Der Freischütz, the latter having become popular in Russia after its first Russian performance in 1824. The role of Torop was created specifically for Alexander Bantyshev.  Performance history  The title page of the 1963 edition of the vocal score of Askold's Grave The directors of the Imperial Theatres paid 2,000 rubles to the composer for this opera. The opera was first staged at the Bolshoi in Moscow on 16 September 1835, a year before Glinka's A Life for the Tsar. The main female role, Nadezhda, was portrayed by the wife of the composer, Nadezhda Repina (1809–1897), the daughter of a serf-musician. Among the other performers: Alexander Bantyshev as Torop, Nikolai Lavrov as Neizvestnyi (the Unknown Man), Pavel Schepin as Vseslav, Vasiliy Jivokini as Frelaf, Nicolay Nikiforov as Blum; choreographer of Russian dances: Ivan Lobanov. In St. Petersburg the opera was staged on August 27, 1841 with the famous bass Osip Petrov in the role of Neizvestnyi (the Unknown Man); Leon Leonov as Torop. It has been claimed that the music was polished up by Gioacchino Rossini, based on Verstovsky's ideas, for a fee that covered a gambling debt.Yuri Arbatsky, Studies in the History of Russian Music, New York, 1956 (in Russian) pp. 231-2 Two piano transcriptions (without voice) were published — one made by K. Vilboa, another by a composer Alexander Gurilyov. A vocal score was produced by O. Dutsh and K. Yevgeniev (published in 1866). By the end of the 1860s the opera had received about 200 performances in St. Petersburg and 400 in Moscow. It was the first Russian opera performed in the United States (in 1869). For this staging some fragments of Glinka's music were added to the opera. After the composer's death another version of the score was made with the orchestration by K. Voyachek, with spoken dialogue replaced by primitive recitatives. The great Russian singer Feodor Chaliapin (1873–1938) loved the opera and chose the role of Neizvestnyi (the Unknown Man) for his benefice on March 3, 1891 when he was just 18, in the S. Semenov-Samarsky provincial opera company in the city of Ufa. This role was regarded as very difficult (see the music example and comments below). The benefice was successful. Chaliapin received 80 rubles and a silver watch with a steel chain. \\"I became rich!\\" — Chaliapin wrote in his memoirs. In February 1899, commemorating a centenary of Verstovsky's birth, Chaliapin sang this role twice at the Private Opera. His recording of the \\"Aria of the Unknown Man\\" is available on CD. A performance in the Sergei Zimin’s theater (Moscow) in 1914 had a huge success. In the Soviet era the opera was forgotten for several decades, and was only revised near the end of the Second World War in 1944 at the Moscow Theatre of Operetta under the title Украденная невеста (Ukradennaya Nevesta – The Stolen Bride), however with not much success. It returned to the stage on November 28, 1959 with a revised version of the libretto by N. Biryukov and musical rearrangement by B. Dobrokhotov. It was given at the Kiev State Opera Theatre, staged by V. Sklarenko and conducted by P. Grigorov.

Askold and Dir were Rurik’s men who settled in Kiev in the 9th century. According to the Russian Primary Chronicle, Oleg of Novgorod, the successor to Rurik, conquered Kiev around 882. He killed Askold and Dir. Olga of Kiev built two churches at the place of their burial. The memorial on the bank of Dnieper River named “Askold’s Grave” still exists. The action takes place in Kiev near the Grave of Kniaz (or Prince) Askold at the end of 10th century — the first years of the rule of Kniaz Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev (it was Kniaz Vladimir I of Kiev in the novel and also in the newer versions of the opera, however, at the time of the first staging, the ruling representatives of tsar's dynasty were not allowed to the stage). Basically this is a love story of orphan Vseslav, the favourite of Kniaz Sviatoslav, and Nadezhda the daughter of a fisherman. They are preparing for the wedding. Suddenly a strange person called Neizvesnyi (the Unknown Man) appeared to the stage. His aim is the revenge for the murder of Kniaz Askold the previous governor of Kiev. He chosen Vseslav as a tool for this revenge, telling him that the latter is a grandson of Kniaz Askold, and the actual successor to the Prince’s throne. The Unknown Man persuades him to betray Kniaz Svyatoslav, kill him and take his place. But Vseslav rejects this plan. The action is luxuriously accompanied with folk songs and dances. ;Overture # Overture ;Act 1 # * Introduction and Nadezhda's Song # Choir of Fishermen # Aria of the Unknown Man # Choir of Fishermen # Choir of Countrymen # Choir and Song – Aria of the Unknown Man -Finale ;Act 2 # * Entr'acte and Couplets of Frelaf and Choir # Ballade of Torop # Couplets of Torop and Choir # Aria of the Unknown Man and Choir in the Ruins # Choir of Christians # Choir of Christians and Finale # Finale ;Act 3 # * Entr'acte and Choir of Young Girls # Slavic Dance # Nadezhda's Aria # Torop's Song # Choir and Torop's Song # Finale ;Act 4 # * Entr’acte and Choir # Melodrama, Choir and Duet # Trio and Finale # Finale  Music and samples  In Askold's Grave, the musical characterization of such personages as Vseslav or his fiancée Nadezhda belong to the sphere of sentiment romance. The style of chorus writing is near to Russian folk music. The role of Varangian Frelaf is comic and forestalls the character of Farlaf in Glinka’s Ruslan and Ludmila. The part of Neizvestnyi (the Unknown Man) is written for the voice (bass) of a very wide range and often a high tessitura.

The two foci F_{1} and F_{2} are generally taken to be fixed at -a and +a, respectively, on the x-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. Basic definition The most common definition of elliptic coordinates (\\\\mu, u) is : x = a \\\\ \\\\cosh \\\\mu \\\\ \\\\cos u : y = a \\\\ \\\\sinh \\\\mu \\\\ \\\\sin u where \\\\mu is a nonnegative real number and u \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi]. On the complex plane, an equivalent relationship is : x + iy = a \\\\ \\\\cosh(\\\\mu + i u) These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae. The trigonometric identity : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\mu} + \\\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu} = \\\\cos^{2} u + \\\\sin^{2} u = 1 shows that curves of constant \\\\mu form ellipses, whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\cos^{2} u} - \\\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sin^{2} u} = \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\mu - \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu = 1 shows that curves of constant u form hyperbolae. =Scale factors= In an orthogonal coordinate system the lengths of the basis vectors are known as scale factors. The scale factors for the elliptic coordinates (\\\\mu, u) are equal to : h_{\\\\mu} = h_{ u} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\cosh^{2}\\\\mu - \\\\cos^{2} u}. Using the double argument identities for hyperbolic functions and trigonometric functions, the scale factors can be equivalently expressed as : h_{\\\\mu} = h_{ u} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\cosh2\\\\mu - \\\\cos2 u)}. Consequently, an infinitesimal element of area equals : dA = h_{\\\\mu} h_{ u} d\\\\mu d u = a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u \\\\right) d\\\\mu d u = a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2}\\\\mu - \\\\cos^{2} u \\\\right) d\\\\mu d u = \\\\frac{a^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh 2 \\\\mu - \\\\cos 2 u \\\\right) d\\\\mu d u and the Laplacian reads : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u \\\\right)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\mu^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial u^{2}} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2}\\\\mu - \\\\cos^{2} u \\\\right)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\mu^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial u^{2}} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{2}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh 2 \\\\mu - \\\\cos 2 u \\\\right)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\mu^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial u^{2}} \\\\right). Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\mu, u) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. Alternative definition An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) are sometimes used, where \\\\sigma = \\\\cosh \\\\mu and \\\\tau = \\\\cos u. Hence, the curves of constant \\\\sigma are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant \\\\tau are hyperbolae. The coordinate \\\\tau must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the \\\\sigma coordinate must be greater than or equal to one. The coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) have a simple relation to the distances to the foci F_{1} and F_{2}. For any point in the plane, the sum d_{1}+d_{2} of its distances to the foci equals 2a\\\\sigma, whereas their difference d_{1}-d_{2} equals 2a\\\\tau. Thus, the distance to F_{1} is a(\\\\sigma+\\\\tau), whereas the distance to F_{2} is a(\\\\sigma-\\\\tau). (Recall that F_{1} and F_{2} are located at x=-a and x=+a, respectively.) A drawback of these coordinates is that the points with Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and (x,-y) have the same coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau), so the conversion to Cartesian coordinates is not a function, but a multifunction. : x = a \\\\left. \\\\sigma \\\\right. \\\\tau : y^{2} = a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right). =Alternative scale factors= The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) are : h_{\\\\sigma} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2}}{\\\\sigma^{2} - 1}} : h_{\\\\tau} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2}}{1 - \\\\tau^{2}}}. Hence, the infinitesimal area element becomes : dA = a^{2} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right)}} d\\\\sigma d\\\\tau and the Laplacian equals : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right) } \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^{2} - 1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^{2} - 1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} \\\\right) + \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tau^{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tau^{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\right) \\\\right]. Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. Extrapolation to higher dimensions Elliptic coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates. The elliptic cylindrical coordinates are produced by projecting in the z-direction. The prolate spheroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the elliptic coordinates about the x-axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci, whereas the oblate spheroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the elliptic coordinates about the y-axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci. Applications The classic applications of elliptic coordinates are in solving partial differential equations, e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation, for which elliptic coordinates are a natural description of a system thus allowing a separation of variables in the partial differential equations. Some traditional examples are solving systems such as electrons orbiting a molecule or planetary orbits that have an elliptical shape. The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful. A typical example might involve an integration over all pairs of vectors \\\\mathbf{p} and \\\\mathbf{q} that sum to a fixed vector \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\mathbf{q}, where the integrand was a function of the vector lengths \\\\left \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\right and \\\\left \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\right. (In such a case, one would position \\\\mathbf{r} between the two foci and aligned with the x-axis, i.e., \\\\mathbf{r} = 2a \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}.) For concreteness, \\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\mathbf{p} and \\\\mathbf{q} could represent the momenta of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).

The M-1 offered a baseline thrust of 6.67 MN (1.5 million lbf) and 8 MN (1.8 million lbf) as its immediate growth target. If built, the M-1 would be larger and more efficient than the famed F-1 that powered the first stage of the Saturn V rocket to the Moon. History The M-1 traces its history to US Air Force studies from the late 1950s for its launch needs in the 1960s. By 1961 these had evolved into the Space Launcher System design. The SLS consisted of a series of four rocket designs, all built around a series of solid-fuel boosters and liquid-hydrogen- powered upper stages. The smallest model, intended to launch the Dynasoar, used two solids and an \\"A\\" liquid core. To power the \\"A\\" booster, Aerojet was contracted to convert an LR-87, used in the Titan II missile, to run on liquid hydrogen. A prototype was successfully tested between 1958 and 1960. Initial studies of the solid were also handed to Aerojet, starting in 1959. The SLS also envisioned a number of much larger designs intended to launch the Air Force's Lunex Project crewed lunar landing. Lunex was a direct landing mission, in which a single very large spacecraft would fly to the Moon, land, and return. In order to launch such a design to low Earth orbit (LEO), a very large booster with a payload would be required. These larger SLS designs followed the same basic outline as the smaller Dynasoar booster, but used much more powerful solids and the \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" liquid stages. To provide the required power, the liquid stages mounted a cluster of twelve J-2s. To reduce this complexity, the Air Force also had Aerojet start studies of a much larger hydrogen-fueled design that would replace the twelve J-2s with only two engines. These initial studies would eventually emerge as the M-1, with a thrust of 1.2 million pounds force. When NASA formed in 1958, they also started planning for a lunar landing. Like the Air Force, their Project Apollo initially favoured a direct ascent profile, requiring a large booster to launch the spacecraft into LEO. Prior to NASA taking over Wernher von Braun's Saturn work for the US Army, they had no large rocket designs of their own, and started a study program known as Nova to study a range of options. Initially, the payload requirements were fairly limited, and the favoured Nova designs used a first stage with four F-1 engines and a payload of about . These designs were presented to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 27, 1959. However, the Apollo spacecraft requirements quickly grew, settling on a spacecraft (the CSM) with a three-person crew. To launch such a craft to the Moon required a massive payload to LEO. Nova designs of this capability were quickly presented with up to eight F-1 engines, along with much more powerful upper stages that demanded the M-1 engine. Thus, for a brief period, the M-1 was used on the baseline designs for both NASA's and the Air Force's lunar programs. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced the goal of landing a person on the Moon before the decade was out. After a brief argument, NASA won the mission over the Air Force. However, Nova would require massive manufacturing capability that did not currently exist, and it was not clear that booster construction could be started in time for a landing before 1970. By 1962 they had decided to use von Braun's Saturn V design, which went through a process of re-design to produce a usable booster that could be built in the existing facilities at Michoud, Louisiana. With the selection of Saturn for the lunar missions, work on Nova turned to the post-Apollo era. The designs were re-targeted for crewed planetary expedition, namely a crewed landing on Mars. Even utilizing a lightweight mission profile like that selected for Apollo, a Mars mission required a truly massive payload of about one million pounds to low Earth orbit. This led to a second series of design studies, also known as Nova, although they were essentially unrelated to the earlier designs. Many of the new designs used the M-1 as their second-stage engine, although demanding much higher payloads. In order to meet these goals, the M-1 project was uprated from 1.2 million pounds force to a nominal 1.5 million pounds force, and the designers deliberately added more turbopump capability to allow it to expand to at least 1.8 million pounds force and potentially as high as 2.0 million. Additionally, the M-1 was even considered for a number of first-stage designs, in place of the F-1 or the solids. For this role the specific impulse was dramatically reduced, and it appears that some consideration was given to various expanding nozzle designs to address this. M-1 development continued through this period, although as the Apollo program expanded, NASA started cutting funding to the M-1 project in order to complete Saturn-related developments first. In 1965, another NASA project studied advanced versions of the Saturn, replacing the cluster of five J-2s on the S-II second stage with one M-1, five J-2Ts (an improved version of the J-2 with an aerospike nozzle), or a high-pressure engine known as the HG-3, which would later become the direct predecessor of the Space Shuttle's SSME. By 1966 it was clear that present funding levels for NASA would not be maintained in the post-Apollo era. The Nova design studies ended that year, and the M-1 along with it. The last M-1 contract expired on August 24, 1965, although testing continued on existing funds until August 1966. Studies on the J-2T ended at the same time. Although the HG-3 was never built, its design formed the basis for the Space Shuttle Main Engine. Description The M-1 used the gas-generator cycle, burning some of its liquid hydrogen and oxygen in a small combustor to provide hot gases for running the fuel pumps. In the case of the M-1, the hydrogen and oxygen turbopumps were completely separate, each using their own turbine, rather than running both off a common power shaft. The hydrogen and oxygen pumps were some of the most powerful ever built at the time, producing 75,000 horsepower for the former, and for the latter. M-1 rocket engine display at Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum A turbopump designed and built for the M-1 rocket engine In most American designs, a gas- generator engine would dump the exhaust from the turbines overboard. In the case of the M-1, the resulting exhaust was relatively cool, and was instead directed into cooling pipes on the lower portion of the engine skirt. This meant that liquid hydrogen was needed for cooling only on the high-heat areas of the engine --the combustion chamber, nozzle and upper part of the skirt-- reducing plumbing complexity considerably. The gas entered the skirt area at about , heating to about before being dumped through a series of small nozzles at the end of the skirt. The exhaust added of thrust. The engine was started by rotating the pumps to operating speed using helium gas stored in a separate high-pressure container. This started the fuel flow into the main engine and gas generator. The main engine was ignited by a spray of sparks directed into the combustion chamber from a pyrotechnic device. Shutdown was achieved by simply turning off the fuel flow to the gas generator, allowing the pumps to slow down on their own. The use of separate turbopumps and other components allowed the various parts of the M-1 to be built and tested individually. Over the three-year lifetime of the project, a total of eight combustion chambers were built (two of them uncooled test units), eleven gas generators, four oxygen pumps, as well as four hydrogen pumps that were in the process of being completed.

It included Peter Brotherton, John Carlin, Mike Thomas and Barrie Machin. CANE was a non-profit grass roots organisation whose aim was to stop the establishment of a nuclear power plant in Western Australia (WA) and to halt uranium mining. The organisation operated out of the Environment Centre in Wellington Street, Perth. The Whitlam Federal government in 1974 had dedicated about A$7,000 per state to set up Regional Environment Centres. Perth's Environment Centre housed other groups including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Conservation Council of Western Australia, Friends of the Earth, and the Campaign to Save Native Forests. A CANE group was also established in Adelaide, South Australia. Aims CANE's statement of objectives stated: > It opposed the development of Nuclear Power Stations. It supported the > Nuclear! Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT or NNPT) and opposed the > proliferation and acquisition of Weapons of Mass destruction and linked WMD > with nuclear power stations. It opposed foreign policies based on nuclear > deterrence. It supported attempts to establish regional nuclear free zones. > It was opposed to the use of Australian ports by nuclear-powered or nuclear- > armed vessels. CANE was opposed to the mining and export of Australian > uranium for other than biomedical purposes. It asked for the cessation of > all uranium mining and development operations. It urged the adoption of long > range alternative energy policies designed to meet the legitimate needs of > future generations. It emphasised that it was coalition of groups and > individuals working for the ideal of a more ethical and equitable energy > future. Campaign activities 1976 was CANE's initial year of protest. There were demonstrations at the Perth Airport and Rockingham against US nuclear armed carriers headed by Barrie Machin, a lecturer at the University of Western Australia (UWA). CANE, under Machin's leadership, was very active in its criticism of the Fox Report 1977. It was also the first anti-nuclear organisation to draw attention to Aboriginal Land Rights and uranium mining. Gloria Brennan, who was the first aboriginal student at the Department of Social Anthropology at UWA, was invited to join CANE and lobby and inform aboriginal communities in WA. She did this very successfully. Gloria later died of cancer, probably brought about from the fall-out from the Maralinga tests. Original membership CANE Original membership CANE CANE decided to hold major demonstrations in 1977. It set no goals about numbers since this obviously could not be predicted. Newspapers varied in their estimates of the crowds. At the first rally in April, supporters marched from the Esplanade to the Parliament House and the attendance was estimated at 600. The second rally, on Hiroshima Day, attracted 3000 people and in November, 10,000 people marched, larger than the anti-Vietnam rallies in Perth a few years earlier. Barrie Machin, as coordinator, first drew attention to the dangers of nuclear power stations as target for terrorists, and the dangers of a link with the foreign policies of the US in a pamphlet titled: Accomplices to Armageddon. In 1977, Barrie Machin represented CANE on the WA steering committee for the Australian Democrats, which was stimulated by Don Chipp largely in response to the issue of uranium mining. Also on the committee was Jack Evans who later became a Senator for the Democrats. > I have been grossly disappointed with the attitude of the government on > uranium mining. ... The last straw on this issue was the action of the > Deputy Prime Minister (Mr.Anthony) in launching a pro-uranium book > simultaneously with a statement by the Ambassador of Japan advocating the > mining of Australian uranium. The breach of our promise to continue the > Australian Assistance Plan; wage indexation; the value of the currency; the > Social Welfare Commission; increased research on solar energy are matters > which have disturbed me greatly. In 1978, with considerable help from Gloria Brennan, Barrie Machin and other CANE members successfully lobbied the Labour Party's National conference. Their success was helped when Bob Hawke's son was manhandled by the police in Melbourne protesting against yellowcake. This was reported in all national newspapers at the time. The Premier Sir Charles Court proposed on 15 June 1979 that Breton Bay, 90 km north of Perth, and Wilbinga, 70 km north of Perth as possible sites for a nuclear power station. On 4 July 1979 a Public Meeting was conducted jointly by CANE and FOE at the Perth Town Hall in response to the announcement. Three speakers (Peter Brotherton of FOE; Peter G. Cook of CANE and Peter F. Cook of the WA Trade and Labour Council) addressed the audience. The Government responded by attacking CANE. The West Australian newspaper on 25 August 1979 reported: \\"The Premier, Sir Charles Court, last night warned of a subtle new propaganda offensive against democracy. He said that the susceptibility of democratic governments to electoral pressure was being exploited as never before… Locally, mysteriously financed pressure groups were trying to force governments into irrational decisions through high powered arousal of emotions based on false evidence. Sir Charles said: 'When you consider that governments make thousands of decisions a year on the basis of close-contact experience of what they are doing backed by outside top-level advice on critical matters, it is clearly against the public interest to exchange this process for one of street-march campaigns and loaded opinion polls.'\\" Senator Ruth Coleman (Australian Labor Party) established another anti-nuclear group Women Against Uranium Mining and started collecting anti- nuclear information about nuclear accidents from every media source. She presented this list of accidents for public distribution, with relevant sources, to raise awareness among West Australians. 'Desperate Measures' was a group of street theatre activist actors based in Fremantle who wrote their own material. They provided social commentary at numerous anti-nuclear events that brought home the messages better than a speech. They presented a show for the finale of CANE's Wilbinga bike ride again the proposed nuclear power station and it including burying a papier mache nuclear reactor on the site. Fundraising events included the CANE 'Concert-in-the-Sun' on 19 December 1981. The concert was organised by Peter Kaldor and featured local rock acts Dave Warner, Matt Taylor-Phil Manning Band (see Matt Taylor, Phil Taylor), the Essentials and the Eurogliders. The audience of around 3,500 people raised $8,000, enough to fund a substantial number of CANE activities throughout the following year. CANE was a member of the Coalition for a Nuclear Free Australia (CNFA), a coalition from across Australia of 79 organisations, unions, anti-nuclear groups, environment centres and Friends of the Earth. People CANE was set up under the aegis of FOE after a meeting at University of Western Australia in late 1975. John Carlin, Barrie Machin, Michael Thomas and Peter Brotherton were present. Ken Strahan was an important part of the group and member of FOE. Barrie Machin was the first enrolled member of CANE and still has the founding membership card. Mike Thomas was the first Chairman. R. M. Hart's signature is on this card as a witness. Barrie Machin was Chairman of the movement from 1977–1978. This can be verified by checking the West Australian Newspapers for the period. There are many letters to the editor from the Chairman. Other Perth media archives, like the ABC, Channel Seven and Nine and Radio Stations carry records of interviews and appearances. Important eyewitnesses of the early days of CANE would include Bill Hare, Andrew Masterson, the novelist and John Hallam (who joined CANE from the Australia Party, John is still very active on nuclear issues with FOE, Kim Doohan, Peter Garrett, Professor Ian Clark, Robyn Juniper, ex- Minister of Aboriginal Affairs- Judyth Watson, Kingley Palmer ex-head of Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra. Under Dr. Machin's guidance the first Hiroshima Day was held this coincided with his Hiroshima Exhibition at the University of WA. Bill Hare, who later became active in ACF and Greenpeace, was also part of the team headed by Barrie Machin. John Hallam was also a key member in this period, Andrew Masterson was a very valuable and young contributor. Peter Brotherton of FOE played a key role in all activities and advice. Barrie Machin and Kim Doohan with one other person broadcast Alternative News on FM 6NR for six months at Western Australian Institute of Technology now Curtin University. It is unfortunate that some of these facts of history have been ignored in a recent account of CANE called 'Stepping Out' the authors of which have admitted they did not check the archives and based their book on limited interviewing, which excluded many key personnel, activists and witnesses. They argue that theirs is a postmodernist interpretation. They did not interview Barrie Machin, who was relegated to the status of a volunteer, nor does it seem to be the case that they interviewed other key founders and later chairperson-Peter Kaldor. Paul Keating was at the Labour Party conference and could have been interviewed as well. Many of the facts of CANE in this book and in the previous Wikipedia content for CANE were unverifiable. There are now some verifiable sources in this entry. Later CANE Chairpersons included Zoe Sofoulis and Peter Kaldor followed by Annabelle Newbury, David Worth and Louise Duxbury. An early but minor member at the time included Jo Vallentine who was later elected to parliament in 1984 as a Nuclear Disarmament Party candidate. End of campaigning The West Australian reported on 7 April 1983 that the new Australian Labor Party State Government abandoned plans for a nuclear power station. The cabinet decided to stop all State Energy Commission inquires that could lead to a nuclear power station. Brian Burke said that the cabinet had reaffirmed that in no circumstances would a nuclear power station be built in WA. After this announcement, many of the CANE activists joined People for Nuclear Disarmament (WA) to campaign against the efforts of the United States and USSR to place short range nuclear missiles into Europe, and CANE ceased to exist in the late 1980s.

He is well known for his work in the minimal techno and microhouse genres, and is one of the most significant figures in today's minimal techno scene. Life and work Villalobos was born in Chile on 6 August 1970. In 1973 he moved to Germany with his family to escape the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power that year. When Villalobos was around 10 or 11 he started to play conga and bongos. He began making electronic music in the late 80s. From a very young age he has been a big fan of Depeche Mode, following their tours around Europe to listen to them. Villalobos began to play his music at parties while he was studying at university, but this was only for his own enjoyment. He started a label, Placid Flavour, in 1993 but this was unsuccessful. His first record was released on the German Playhouse label in 1994 and he began DJing as a professional in 1998. In 2006 Villalobos, along with Richie Hawtin and Luciano, played to around 300,000 people at the Berlin Loveparade. At the end of 2008 and 2010, he came first in Resident Advisor's Top 100 DJs of the year. Villalobos has released several records on various notable labels, such as Perlon, Playhouse and [a:rpia:r].

Three aircraft, the A.W.52G glider and two jet-powered research aircraft, were built for the programme. The airliner was cancelled but research flying continued until 1954. History and Design Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft proposed a jet-powered six or four-engine flying wing airliner design, using a laminar flow wing, during the Second World War. This had to be a large aircraft in order to provide passenger head-room within the wing. The low-speed characteristics of the design were tested on a 53 ft 10 in (16.41 m) span wooden glider known as the A.W.52G; the glider was designed to be roughly half the size of the powered A.W.52, which in turn would be about half the size of the airliner. Construction of the AW.52G began in March 1943, with the glider making its maiden flight, towed by an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber, on 2 March 1945. Flight testing, with tug releases from 20,000 ft (6,096 m) giving flights of around 30 min continued, mostly satisfactorily until 1947. In 1944, Armstrong Whitworth received a contract that would allow them to produce two A.W.52 prototypes for evaluation, nominally as mail carrying aircraft. The A.W.52 was intended for high speeds and was an all-metal turbojet-powered aircraft, with a retractable undercarriage; aerodynamically it had much in common with the glider. Both aircraft were moderately-swept flying wings with a centre section having a straight trailing edge. The wing tips carried small (not full chord) end-plate fin and rudders, which operated differentially, with a greater angle on the outer one. Roll and pitch were controlled with elevons that extended inward from the wing tips over most (in the case of the A.W.52 about three-quarters) of the outer, swept part of the trailing edge. The elevons moved together as elevators and differentially as ailerons. They were quite complicated surfaces – which included trim tabs – and hinged not from the wing but from \\"correctors\\", which were wing-mounted; the correctors provided pitch trim. To delay tip stall, air was sucked out of a slot just in front of the elevons, by pumps powered by undercarriage-mounted fans on the glider and directly from the engine in the A.W.52. The inner centre section wing carried Fowler flaps and the upper surface of the outer section carried spoilers. Maintenance of laminar flow over the wings was vital to the design and so they were built with great attention to surface flatness. Rather than the usual approach, where skinning is added to a structure defined by ribs, the A.W.52's wings were built in two halves (upper and lower) from the outside in, starting from pre-formed surfaces, adding stringers and ribs then joining the two halves together. The result was a surface smooth to better than 2/1000 of an inch (50 μm). The crew sat in tandem in a nacelle so that the pilot was just forward of the wing leading edge, providing a better view than in the glider. The pressurised cockpit was slightly off-set to port. The engines were mounted in the wing centre section, close to the centre line and so not disturbing the upper wing surface. The first prototype flew on 13 November 1947 powered by two Rolls-Royce Nene engines of 5,000 lbf (22.2 kN) thrust each. This was followed by the second prototype on 1 September 1948 with the lower-powered (3,500 lbf/15.5 kN) Rolls Royce Derwent. Trials were disappointing: laminar flow could not be maintained, so maximum speeds, though respectable, were less than expected. As in any tail-less aircraft, take-off and landing runs were longer than for a conventional aircraft (at similar wing loadings) because at high angles of attack, downward elevon forces were much greater than those of elevators with their large moment. The first prototype crashed without loss of life on 30 May 1949, making it the first occasion of an emergency ejection by a British pilot. Despite the termination of development, the second prototype remained flying with the Royal Aircraft Establishment until 1954. The accident On 30 May 1949, while diving the first prototype at 320 mph (515 km/h), test pilot J.O. Lancaster encountered a pitch oscillation believed to be caused by elevon flutter. Starting at two cycles per second, it rapidly increased to incapacitating levels. With structural failure seemingly imminent, Lancaster ejected from the aircraft using its Martin-Baker Mk.1 ejection seat, becoming the first British pilot to use the apparatus in a \\"live\\" emergency. It was fortunate that he was alone in the aircraft as the second crew member was not provided with an ejection seat. Subsequently, the aircraft stopped fluttering and glided down and landed in open country with relatively little damage. Following this incident, and in view of the disappointing results, no further development of the flying-wing formula was undertaken by Armstrong Whitworth, which had now turned its attention to the more conventional A.W. 55 propeller-turbine airliner. The second A.W. 52 was handed over to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, where it was used for experimental flying until it was finally disposed of in June 1954.

Early life and education  The son of a miner, Reg Ward was born on 5 October 1927 in the Forest of Dean and educated at East Dean Grammar School, Cinderford, Gloucestershire.Obituary: Reg Ward, Daily Telegraph, 12 January 2011 While lecturing on radar equipment as a young RAF pilot, he was encouraged to apply for University – the first in his family to do so. He went to Manchester University to study Medieval History and then Fine Art and Architecture. However he rejected the possibility of becoming an academic, preferring instead to join the Inland Revenue as a Tax Inspector.  Local government  A series of local government appointments followed, culminating in him becoming Chief executive of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and later of Hereford and Worcester County Council.  LDDC  Ward was a surprise choice by Secretary of State Michael Heseltine to lead the new Docklands body on its inception in 1980 and for 9 months was the only member of staff during its \\"shadow period\\" of operation. However this long period gave him the opportunity to walk extensively through Docklands, drawing pictures of the old warehouses and imagining what possible redevelopments could take place. A story told by ex LDDC staffers was that his first work for the organisation took place using a bucket for a seat and an old upturned tea chest as a desk.Obituary in Estates Gazette, 10 January 2011 Docklands had been the subject of many redevelopment frameworks and plans over the years, none of which had come to fruition. Ward's genius was to be open to new ideas, and to seize opportunities which came along, rather than to create reports and paperwork. Ward said if he had created some grand plan...\\"we would still be debating and nothing would have got built. Instead, we have gone for an organic, market-driven approach, responding pragmatically to each situation.\\" It was Ward who invited Michael von Clemm of Credit Suisse First Boston to Docklands, originally to look for a site for a food factory. When von Clemm suggested that the Canary Wharf site might be suitable for offices to house bank trading floors, Ward leapt upon the idea and helped sell it to Government. (For full story see Canary Wharf entry). At the LDDC Ward was responsible for progressing the ideas of Docklands Light Railway, London City Airport, Canary Wharf and he helped Iain Shearer on the ExCeL Exhibition Centre. According to the Daily Telegraph: \\"Ward’s greatest achievement was to persuade hard-nosed City and property investors that Docklands revival was going to work. By 1986, the LDDC had spent around £300m of public money, but had succeeded in attracting £1.4 billion in private investment.\\" His forthright style did not sit well with his colleagues in central government, in particular the Secretary of State for the Environment Nicholas Ridley, appointed to replace Heseltine in 1986. Ward's disregard for Civil Service protocol and rules caused one colleague to remark: \\"the corns he has stepped on would fill more shoes than even Imelda Marcos possessed\\". He is said to have once avoided answering phone calls from the Secretary of State for several days because he knew the call was to say that one of his road projects would be cancelled. Ward was eased out of his job shortly after the deal on Canary Wharf was signed. However, he is now viewed as the main driver in Government behind the extraordinary change and development in London Docklands. If there is one single person that was responsible for London's Dockland being transformed into London Docklands, that person is Reg Ward.  Career after LDDC  Ward went on to work in Barcelona and Sydney on major regeneration projects before being appointed to head the regeneration of St Kitts in the Caribbean. In his later years, he ran his own consultancy company and was a regular contributor to debates on urban regeneration and the future of the Thames Gateway. Private life Ward married Betty in 1954. They had met in nursery school and she predeceased him in early 2010. They had two children.

His recordings include influential surveys of the orchestral music of Hamilton Harty and Arnold Bax. He was principal conductor of several British orchestras, including the Ulster Orchestra, which flourished under his tenure. Biography =Early life and studies= Bryden (\\"Jack\\") Thomson was born in Ayr and grew up playing the violin and cello. Soon after entering the Royal Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow on a scholarship at the age of 15, he was called up to serve in the Highland Light Infantry, where he played the piano in the regimental band and taught himself the clarinet. After the war, he returned to his studies at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. In 1954, he moved to Germany to study conducting, first with Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt at the newly founded Hochschule für Musik in Hamburg, and then with Igor Markevitch at the Mozarteum University of Salzburg. =Career= Following a post as assistant conductor of the BBC Scottish Orchestra (1958–1962), Bryden Thomson held posts as principal conductor of several British orchestras, including the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra (1968–1973), the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra (1978–1982) and the Ulster Orchestra (1977–1985). Between 1984 and 1987 he was principal conductor of the Irish RTÉ Symphony Orchestra. He was also briefly chief conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra (1988–1990), being only the second Scotsman to hold that post. As an opera conductor, Thomson also worked with the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, the Royal Swedish Opera and the Scottish Opera. Thomson was a committed interpreter of British music. He helped revive the popularity of the music of Arnold Bax by making an extensive series of CD recordings for Chandos Records (with the Ulster orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra), including many of the tone poems and an acclaimed cycle of the symphonies. He did a similar service for the music of Irish composer Hamilton Harty by recording the collected orchestral works with the Ulster Orchestra, again for Chandos. He also set down with Chandos well received series of recordings of orchestral music by Vaughan Williams and Walton. Other British composers he championed include Alun Hoddinott, Daniel Jones, Kenneth Leighton, Thomas Wilson and Grace Williams. A cycle of Martinů symphonies recorded with the Scottish National Orchestra between 1989 and 1990 has been critically praised. Thomson also cultivated a keen interest in Nordic composers such as Holmboe, Nielsen, Sallinen and Sibelius. His interpretations of Nielsen have been much admired, including a recording of the Symphony No. 4 and Symphony No. 6 with the Scottish National Orchestra, which turned out to be his last recording. =Personal life and legacy= Thomson died of cancer in Dublin, in November 1991. In 2003, his widow, Mary Ellison Thomson, bequeathed his collection of scores to the National Library of Ireland, and in 2008 she set up the Bryden Thomson Trust in support of young conductors.

He was born and reared in New York City, the son of writer and activist Ruth Hale and newspaper columnist Heywood Broun.  Early life  Broun was educated at Hessian Hills School and other private schools and Swarthmore College near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1940, Broun joined the staff at the New York tabloid PM as a sportswriter. His career was interrupted by World War II in which he served in the United States Army field artillery. When the war ended he returned to the PM newspaper and wrote for its successor, the New York Star, which ceased operations in 1949. Woodie was married to Jane Lloyd Jones, and they had one son, Heywood Orren Broun, known as Hob, a novelist, who predeceased his parents in 1987. Career He went from Broadway to CBS in 1966, where he worked for two decades as a color commentator on a wide variety of sporting events, including the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing alongside his colleague Jack Whitaker. Along with his long-time producer E.S. \\"Bud\\" Lamoreaux, he became a permanent fixture from the initial broadcast in January 1966 of the Saturday edition of the CBS Evening News with Roger Mudd. Broun was noted for his \\"merry mustache, his loud jackets and his suitcase full of words, oh what words,\\" as Lamoreaux later put it in a retrospective of Broun's work that appeared in a series of 36 half-hour shows on ESPN called Woodie's World. Broun's five-minute Saturday night features on CBS were about the big stories and the not so little ones. Starting with Lombardi and Namath in Super Bowls I and III, moving on to Ali and Frazier, along with DiMaggio and Ted Williams and \\"the Miracle Mets,\\" and Russell and Cousy and Wilt Chamberlain, and Nicklaus and Secretariat and Ruffian, Broun also contributed some distinguished reporting from the Mexico City and Munich Olympics where he reported on important world events like the \\"Black Power salute\\" of the American sprinters John Carlos and Tommy Smith at the playing of the National Anthem in 1968 and the terrorist attack on the Israeli wrestling team in 1972. However, in between the \\"big stories,\\" he filed pieces from the national marbles championship in Wildwood, New Jersey, the national lefthanded golfers championship in Galesburg, Illinois and a profile of a rodeo clown in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Broun also took a lap in a racing sports car with Britain's Stirling Moss, showed up as the coxswain of the Harvard crew as they prepared for their annual battle on the Thames River in New London, Connecticut, with arch-rival Yale, and was run over by a wild horse at the American Indian rodeo in Oregon, after which he tracked down an American original, Buckskin Billie Hart, who was living a hermit's life at the confluence of the Salmon River and Wildhorse Creek, somewhere near a remote dude ranch in Mackey Bar, Idaho.  Woodie's World  In 2002, ESPN Classic debuted a series devoted to Broun's reporting, titled Woodie's World. The 30 minute program typically featured four stories from Broun's Saturday featurettes with current information inserted as needed. Woodie's World ran for 36 episodes from 2002 through 2005. Beginning in 2009, ESPN Classic brought the series back in reruns, which continue to air sporadically on the network.  Acting career  Broun acted in a number of films, including: * The Odd Couple (1968): In this film, he plays himself, a sportswriter at a New York Mets versus Pittsburgh Pirates game. While fellow sportswriter Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) takes a phone call from roommate Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon) about mundane dinner plans, the Mets pull off a triple play. Broun exclaims, \\"A triple play, Oscar! One of the greatest plays I've ever seen, and you missed it! You missed it, Oscar!\\" * For Pete's Sake (1974) * HouseSitter (1992) Additionally, he sometimes appeared on television series in guest or supporting roles. In 1952 and 1957, Broun was cast in two episodes of the anthology series, Robert Montgomery Presents. From 1955 to 1957, he guest starred in three episodes of The Phil Silvers Show, also known as You'll Never Get Rich. Broun was cast in 1962 and 1963 in different character roles in five episodes of the NBC police sitcom, Car 54, Where Are You?, starring Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne. He subsequently appeared twice on the ABC sitcom, The Patty Duke Show, as Mr. Mickel in \\"The Babysitters\\" (1963) and as Mr. Fleming in \\"This Little Patty Went to Market\\" (1964).

Positively or negatively curved Riemannian manifolds  The Hopf conjecture is an open problem in global Riemannian geometry. It goes back to questions of Heinz Hopf from 1931. A modern formulation is: : A compact, even-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature has positive Euler characteristic. A compact, (2d)-dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature has Euler characteristic of sign (-1)^d. For surfaces, these statements follow from the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. For four-dimensional manifolds, this follows from the finiteness of the fundamental group and Poincaré duality and Euler-Poincaré formula equating for 4-manifolds the Euler characteristic with b_0-b_1+b_2-b_3+b_4 and the Synge's theorem assuring that the orientation cover is simply connected so that the Betti numbers vanish b_1=b_3=0. For 4-manifolds, the statement also follows from the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem as noticed by John Milnor in 1955 (written down by Shiing-Shen Chern in 1955.). For manifolds of dimension 6 or higher the conjecture is open. An example of Robert Geroch had shown that the Chern- Gauss-Bonnet integrant can become negative for d>2.R. Geroch, Positive sectional curvatures does not imply positive Gauss-Bonnet integrand, Proceedings of the AMS, 54, 1976 The positive curvature case is known to hold however for hypersurfaces in \\\\R^{2d+1} (Hopf) or codimension two surfaces embedded in \\\\R^{2d+2}. For sufficiently pinched positive curvature manifolds, the Hopf conjecture (in the positive curvature case) follows from the Sphere theorem, a theorem which had also been conjectured first by Hopf. One of the lines of attacks is by looking for manifolds with more symmetry. It is particular for example that all known manifolds of positive sectional curvature allow for an isometric circle action. The corresponding vector field is called a Killing vector field. The conjecture (for the positive curvature case) has also been proved for manifolds of dimension 4k+2 or 4k+4 admitting an isometric torus action of a k-dimensional torus and for manifolds M admitting an isometric action of a compact Lie group G with principal isotropy subgroup H and cohomogeneity k such that k-(\\\\operatorname{rank} G-\\\\operatorname{rank} H)\\\\leq 5. Some references about manifolds with some symmetry are Thomas Püttmann and Catherine Searle, The Hopf conjecture for manifolds with low cohomogeneity or high symmetry rank, Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 130 (2001), no. 1, 163-166. and L. Kennard, \\"On the Hopf conjecture with symmetry, Geometry and Topology, 17, 2013, pages 563-593 On the history of the problem: the first written explicit appearance of the conjecture is in the proceedings of the German Mathematical Society, which is a paper based on talks, Heinz Hopf gave in the spring of 1931 in Fribourg, Switzerland and at Bad Elster in the fall of 1931. Marcel Berger discusses the conjecture in his book, and points to the work of Hopf from the 1920s which was influenced by such type of questions. The conjectures are listed as problem 8 (positive curvature case) and 10 (negative curvature case) in \`\`Yau's problems\\" of 1982.  Non-negatively or non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds  There are analogue conjectures if the curvature is allowed to become zero too. The statement should still be attributed to Hopf (for example in a talk given in 1953 in Italy).H. Hopf, Sulla geometria riemanniana globale della superficie, Rendiconti del Seminario matematico e fisico di Milano, 1953, pages 48-63 : A compact, even-dimensional Riemannian manifold with non-negative sectional curvature has non-negative Euler characteristic. A compact, (2d)-dimensional Riemannian manifold with non- positive sectional curvature has Euler characteristic of sign (-1)^d or zero. This version was stated as such as Question 1 in the paper R.L. Bishop and S.I. Goldberg, Some implications on the generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, Transactions of the AMS, 112, pages 508-545, 1964 or then in a paper of Chern.S.-S. Chern, The geometry of G-structures, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 72, pages 167-2019, 1966 An example for which the conjecture is confirmed is for the product M=M_1 \\\\times M_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times M_d of 2-dimensional manifolds with curvature sign e_k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{-1,0,1\\\\\\\\}. As the Euler characteristic satisfies \\\\chi(M) = \\\\prod_{k=1}^d \\\\chi(M_k) which has the sign \\\\prod_{k=1}^d e_k, the sign conjecture is confirmed in that case (if e_k>0 for all k, then \\\\chi(M)>0 and if e_k<0 for all k, then \\\\chi(M)>0 for even d and \\\\chi(M)<0 for odd d, and if one of the e_k is zero, then \\\\chi(M)=0).  Product conjecture for the product of two spheres  Another famous question of Hopf is the Hopf product conjecture: : Can the 4-manifold \\\\mathbb{S}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{S}^2 carry a metric with positive curvature? The conjecture was popularized in the book of Gromoll, Klingenberg and Meyer from 1968, and was prominently displayed as problem 1 in Yau's list of problems. Yau formulated there an interesting new observation (which could be reformulated as a conjecture). : One does not know any example of a compact, simply-connected manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature which does not admit a metric of strictly positive curvature. At present, the 4-sphere \\\\mathbb{S}^4 and the complex projective plane \\\\mathbb{CP}^2 are the only simply-connected 4-manifolds which are known to admit a metric of positive curvature. Wolfgang Ziller once conjectured this might be the full list and that in dimension 5, the only simply-connected 5-manifold of positive curvature is the 5-sphere \\\\mathbb{S}^5.W. Ziller, Riemannian Manifolds with Positive Sectional Curvature, Lecture given in Guanajuato of 2010 in: Geometry of Manifolds with Non-negative Sectional Curvature, Springer, 2014 Of course, solving the Hopf product conjecture would settle the Yau question. Also the Ziller conjecture that \\\\mathbb{S}^4 and \\\\mathbb{CP}^2 are the only simply connected positive curvature 4-manifolds would settle the Hopf product conjecture. Back to the case \\\\mathbb{S}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{S}^2: it is known from work of Jean-Pierre Bourguignon that in the neighborhood of the product metric, there is no metric of positive curvature. It is also known from work of Alan Weinstein that if a metric is given on \\\\mathbb{S}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{S}^2 exists with positive curvature, then this Riemannian manifold can not be embedded in \\\\mathbb{R}^6. (It follows already from a result of Hopf that an embedding in \\\\R^5 is not possible as then the manifold has to be a sphere.) A general reference for manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature giving many examples is Wolfgang Ziller, Examples of Riemannian manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature, Surf. Differ. Geom, 11, pages 63-102, International Press, 2007 as well as.C. Escher and W. Ziller, Topology of non-negatively curved manifolds\\", Annals of Global Analysis and geometry, 46, pages 23-55, 2014 A related conjecture is that : A compact symmetric space of rank greater than one cannot carry a Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvature. This would also imply that \\\\mathbb{S}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{S}^2 admits no Riemannian metric with positive sectional curvature. So, when looking at the evidence and the work done so far, it appears that the Hopf question most likely will be answered as the statement \\"There is no metric of positive curvature on \\\\mathbb{S}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{S}^2\\" because so far, the theorems of Bourguignon (perturbation result near product metric), Hopf (codimension 1), Weinstein (codimension 2) as well as the sphere theorem excluding pinched positive curvature metrics, point towards this outcome. The construction of a positive curvature metric on \\\\mathbb{S}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{S}^2 would certainly be a surprise in global differential geometry, but it is not excluded yet that such a metric exists. Finally, one can ask why one would be interested in such a special case like the Hopf product conjecture. Hopf himself was motivated by problems from physics. When Hopf started to work in the mid 1920s, the theory of relativity was only 10 years old and it sparked a great deal of interest in differential geometry, especially in global structure of 4-manifolds, as such manifolds appear in cosmology as models of the universe.  (Unrelated:) Thurston conjecture on aspherical manifolds  There is a conjecture which relates to the Hopf sign conjecture but which does not refer to Riemannian geometry at all. Aspherical manifolds are connected manifolds for which all higher homotopy groups disappear. The Euler characteristic then should satisfy the same condition as a negatively curved manifold is conjectured to satisfy in Riemannian geometry: : Suppose M2k is a closed, aspherical manifold of even dimension. Then its Euler characteristic satisfies the inequality (-1)^k\\\\chi(M^{2k})\\\\geq 0. There can not be a direct relation to the Riemannian case as there are aspherical manifolds that are not homeomorphic to a smooth Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature. This topological version of Hopf conjecture is due to William Thurston. Ruth Charney and Michael Davis conjectured that the same inequality holds for a non-positively curved piecewise Euclidean (PE) manifold.  (Unrelated:) Riemannian metrics with no conjugate points There had been a bit of confusion about the word \`\`Hopf conjecture\\" as an unrelated mathematician Eberhard Hopf and contemporary of Heinz Hopf worked on topics like geodesic flows. (Eberhard Hopf and Heinz Hopf are unrelated and might never have met even so they were both students of Erhard Schmidt). There is a theorem of Eberhard Hopf stating that if the 2-torus \\\\mathbb{T}^2 has no conjugate points, then it must be flat (the Gauss curvature is zero everywhere).E. Hopf, Closed Surfaces without conjugate points, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA, 34, page 47-51 (1948) The theorem of Eberhard Hopf generalized a theorem of Marston Morse and Gustav Hedlund (a PhD student of Morse) from a year earlier.M. Morse and G.A. Hedlund, Manifolds without conjugate points, Trans. Am. Math.Soc., 51, pages 362-386, 1942 The problem to generalize this to higher dimensions was for some time known as the Hopf conjecture too. In any case, this is now a theorem: A Riemannian metric without conjugate points on the n-dimensional torus is flat.

McEniff played as a wing-back for the St Joseph's combination of clubs from Bundoran and Ballyshannon. He won seven Donegal Senior Football Championships with them, and another one with Réalt na Mara when St Joseph's divided. He won two Ulster Senior Football Championships with the Donegal county team as player-manager in 1972 and 1974, and was awarded an All Star after the first of these, before being ousted. He returned to manage the county to a third Ulster SFC in 1983, then left again. He returned once more in 1989, leading the county to its fourth and fifth Ulster SFCs in 1990 and 1992, as well as the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in the last of these. After becoming chairman of the County Board, McEniff was unable to find a manager so did the job himself for a final time, reaching the All- Ireland SFC semi-final in 2003. In July 1992, Hogan Stand described McEniff as \\"one of the most successful football gurus in modern-day GAA history\\" and he has been likened to a footballing Godfather-type figure. Until 2011, he was directly involved in each of his county's Ulster Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Football Championship wins. That year, Jim McGuinness (whom McEniff had recommended for the under-21 managerial role the previous year) won the first of the post-McEniff Ulster SFCs. Declan Bonner, who won his first Ulster SFC as manager in 2018, also regards McEniff as a mentor. Both McGuinness and Bonner played under McEniff when McEniff was Donegal manager. McEniff managed the Ulster provincial football team for many decades. He coached Ireland to victory over Australia in the 2001 International Rules Series, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Football Park in Adelaide in October that year. Early life McEniff was born in Bundoran, County Donegal. His parents were County Monaghan, and Begley from Carrickmore, County Tyrone. They were married in Bundoran in 1935. McEniff has three brothers: P. J. McEniff (retired dentist), Sean McEniff (Donegal County Councillor) and Liam McEniff (doctor), and one sister, Mary McGlynn (retired hotel accountant). \\"From the age of eight or nine my mother had me washing dishes on a biscuit tin at the Holyrood, \\" Brian said in a Tribune interview in 2004. He spent much of his childhood in Carrickmore, where his mother's family had a farmhouse. He attended a boarding school in County Monaghan. Playing career McEniff supported Tyrone against Louth in the 1957 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final, his first visit to Croke Park. After returning from Canada in the mid-1960s, McEniff took up an interest in playing the sport. His position was in defence as a wing-back. McEniff won numerous titles with the famous St Joseph's combination of Bundoran and Ballyshannon, both in Donegal and Ulster. He won Donegal Senior Football Championships with St Joseph's in 1965, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976. He won his last County Senior Football Championship with Réalt na Mara in 1979, which included the late Brendan McHugh and Seamus Reilly, both county representatives for Sligo, Mayo and Donegal. He captained St Joseph's to the 1968 Ulster Senior Club Football Championship final. He continued working to promote his club long into retirement. He managed them as recently as 2013. McEniff was player- manager of the first Donegal team to win an Ulster Senior Football Championship title in 1972. He received an All Star award in 1972. He was also player-manager of the 1974 Ulster SFC winning team. He was wing-back in the final as Donegal defeated Down. Management career In 1975, the Donegal County Board ousted McEniff as manager. In 1975, he assisted as a mentor the Sligo team that won that county's second Connacht Senior Football Championship. Upon being made aware that he would be taking charge of Sligo's training sessions, Barnes Murphy, the team captain, talked to McEniff. Murphy brought McEniff to Croke Park for the 1975 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final against Kerry (\\"although some of our friends in Sligo weren't too happy about that\\", Murphy told The Irish Times in 2007). McEniff, according to Murphy, could not provide advice to the team at half-time: \\"And I can tell you why, because they [Murphy had also brought along John \\"Tull\\" Dunne] were snubbed. They wanted to make a few changes, and I was wondering where these men where, to give us some advice\\". Sligo were routed by The Kingdom, 3–13 to 0–5. He later returned as Donegal manager, for the first time as a non-playing member of the team. He was manager in 1977. He was manager again by late 1982. He led Donegal to a third Ulster SFC in 1983. They narrowly lost to Galway in the 1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final. He left again. He began to manage the Ulster provincial football team, with which he won 12 Railway Cup Finals. He managed them for 23 years, until 2008. He helped Tyrone club Carrickmore, where his mother was from, when they were struggling against relegation in 1983 and 1986. McEniff returned as Donegal manager in 1989, succeeding Tom Conaghan. He led the county to another Ulster SFC in 1990, restoring players that Conaghan had thrown by the wayside, such as Declan Bonner, Manus Boyle, Matt Gallagher, Barry McGowan and Sylvester Maguire. McEniff's success in Gaelic games culminated when he led his native Donegal team to glory over Dublin at Croke Park in the 1992 All- Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. It was shortly before this match that McEniff was informed that the brother of one of his players Joyce McMullan, had died from cancer. He chose not to inform McMullan or anyone else on the team until after the match. McEniff later described it as follows: \\"Everything had gone so smoothly but when I heard that I was knocked for six. Luckily, the lads were outside watching a bit of the minor match. I stamped up and down before deciding that Gerard would have wanted Joyce to play. When the team came back, they could see something was wrong with me, but I managed to hold it together\\". It later emerged that there had been a miscommunication, and that McMullan's brother had not died. He did so a year later. McEniff resigned on 26 June 1994 and was succeeded by P. J. McGowan the following month. McEniff managed Ireland for the International Rules Series of 2000 and 2001. Ireland won 2001's first test, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 12 October, by 59–53 and the second test, held at Football Park in Adelaide on 19 October, by 71–52. McEniff departed as Ireland manager in 2001. He soon returned for a last outing as Donegal manager. He was chairman of the Donegal County Board in late 2002 but could not find a manager, so he did it himself. McGowan, Michael Oliver McIntyre and Anthony Harkin were part of his backroom team. In 2003, he led Donegal to the All-Ireland SFC semi-final. This was the last occasion on which they would achieve this feat until the time of the legendary Jim McGuinness. He left Donegal in 2005 after a fifth and final tenure in charge ended with a drab qualifier defeat to Cavan at Breffni Park. During his final time as manager, McEniff called such players as Neil Gallagher, Rory Kavanagh, Karl Lacey and Eamon McGee into the senior county team for the first time in late 2003. McEniff was mentor to Nell McCafferty on the Celebrity Bainisteoir television programme in 2007. In 2010 and 2011, McEniff assisted Louth manager Peter Fitzpatrick in an advisory capacity, during which time Louth reached the 2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final. In November that year, it was widely reported that he would become one of Fitzpatrick's selectors for the following season, with both Highland Radio and Hogan Stand claiming he would replace the departing Martin McQuillan. McEniff later denied this, though Louth County Board Chairman Padraic O'Connor said McEniff would be a \\"great capture\\" and would not be paid. He managed his local club in the 2013 Donegal Senior Football Championship, taking over from Joe Keeney after his resignation and filling the position in his 71st year. McEniff has guided both Jim McGuinness and Declan Bonner, his most noteworthy successors as Donegal manager, into management. =Management style= Personal connections formed a critical part of McEniff's management style, so much so that when Declan Bonner brought his wife to Austria on their honeymoon McEniff maintained regular contact. Other ventures Involved in Gaelic games administration in County Donegal, McEniff also spent time as Donegal's GAA Central Council delegate. He served on national Gaelic games committees. He has also been a referee. He is Managing Director of the McEniff Hotel Group, which has a presence in such locations as Bundoran, Drumcondra, Sligo, Rosses Point and Westport, County Mayo. Its portfolio includes the Holyrood Hotel (originally bought by his father John in 1951) and the Great Northern Hotel & Golf links (bought from CIÉ in 1977 by Brian and Sean McEniff and Brian's brother-in-law Michael Burke for £125,000). In 1969, McEniff bought the Hamilton Hotel which was next door to the Holyrood Hotel. On 7 June 1979, McEniff was elected onto Donegal County Councilhttp://electionsireland.com/election.php?elecid=169&constitid;=132 Even though his father was a strong Fine Gael supporter, his mother was a supporter of Fianna Fáil. He was appointed to the board of Ireland West Airport in 2002. Personal life McEniff is married to Cautie. =Health= In later life McEniff developed a bad back. During his appearance on Up for the Match ahead of the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, McEniff was visibly stiff, awkward and in some pain. One day after undergoing surgery on his back he attended the 2012 All Stars Awards in Dublin—at which All-Ireland Champions Donegal received eight places out of a possible fifteen on the All Stars Team of the Year and Karl Lacey was named All Stars Footballer of the Year—saying \\"I wouldn't miss this for the world.\\" Honours ;Player * Ulster Senior Football Championship: 1972, 1974 * Donegal Senior Football Championship: 1965, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1979 ;Manager * All- Ireland Senior Football Championship: 1992 * Ulster Senior Football Championship: 1972, 1974, 1983, 1990, 1992 * Railway Cup: 1983, 1984, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2007 * International Rules Series: 2001 ;Individual * All Star: 1972 * In August 2011, McEniff was inducted into the MBNA Kick Fada Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Croke Park. * In May 2012, the Irish Independent named him in its selection of Donegal's \\"greatest team\\" spanning the previous 50 years. * In 2017, the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) chose McEniff and Kilkenny hurler Eddie Keher as its recipients of lifetime achievement awards. * On 19 April 2018, McEniff was presented with an All-Ireland Lifetime Achievement Award at the All-Ireland Business Summit. * In May 2020, the Belfast Telegraph named him as one of the \\"inspirational quartet\\" who would feature on Ulster GAA's Mount Rushmore.

Early life Hernandez is a first-generation Puerto Rican who grew up in Spanish Harlem, New York City. As a young teenager, the first band he played and recorded with was called Eddie Hernandez & his Orchestra. He learned to play the vibes from George Rodriguez of The New Swing Sextet. Career Hernandez has worked with assorted musical groups and artists including Ralfi Pagan, Joe Bataan, Vernon Reid, N'Dea Davenport, Nona Hendryx, Tito Puente, Manny Oquendo & Conjunto Libre, Hall & Oates and Machito. He was known as Sugarcoated Andy while in Dr. Buzzard's band and played vibes, marimba and percussion for them. He credits Stony Browder, August Darnell and Cory Daye of Dr. Buzzard's band as major influences. In 1979, along with Adriana Kaegi, he helped create Kid Creole and the Coconuts. Hernandez was the musical director and arranger for the Coconuts band until his departure in 1989. His single \\"Me No Pop I\\" reached #32 on the British charts in summer 1981. The song was ranked at #3 among the top ten \\"Tracks of the Year\\" for 1981 by NME. Hernandez is a self-taught musician. His main instrument is the vibraphone but he also plays piano, percussion, and flute, and is a music arranger and composer. He once said in an interview, \\"I have never let the lack of talent stop me from doing anything.\\" He cited an example of this regarding the \\"Gichy Dan and Beachwood 9\\" record produced by Ron Rogers and August Darnell. He was being interviewed for the job of arranger-orchestrator by the head of A&R; at RCA records. Asked if he knew how to arrange for strings, he replied without hesitation, \\"Of course\\", and convinced them to give him the job. In actuality, he did not know a thing about string arrangements. Immediately after the interview, he bought a book on arranging for strings and woodshedded day and night. The result was a successful arrangement job; his work was complimented by the great violinist Harry Lookofsky who served as concertmaster on the date. In 1983, he released a solo album titled Little Coati Mundi The Former 12 Year Old Genius. Mundi composed, produced and provided the lead vocals. It contained a version of Captain Beefheart's \\"Tropical Hot Dog Night\\" featuring salsa singer Rubén Blades. The album also featured former Kid Creole & The Coconuts singer Lori Eastside. Coati Mundi had several appearances on the TV show Miami Vice including the episode \\"No Exit\\" with Bruce Willis and \\"Everybody's in Showbiz\\" with Benicio del Toro (see List of Miami Vice guest appearances ). Hernandez appeared as an actor in the film Who's That Girl starring Madonna and Griffin Dunne. He wrote and performed a song for the soundtrack album called: \\"El Coco Loco\\". Mundi has acted in several Spike Lee films, including Mo Better Blues, He Got Game and Girl 6. He can also be seen in the film We Own the Night. He is credited as one of the music supervisors for the Miramax film 54 and as producer of several of the film's songs. Hernandez has composed music for various films, including Spike of Bensonhurst. He is also the composer and sound designer for a series of educational DVDs for children produced by Karyn Parsons (Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). In December 2010 he released a new solo CD Coati Mundi Is Dancing For The Cabana Code In The Land Of Boo-Hoo (Rong Music). The recording has garnered favorable reviews and praises by the New York Times, Time Out magazine, Village Voice and others. On December 16, 2010, he appeared in the line-up on the BBC music/comedy show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.

He is best known today for his 1971 magnum opus The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, in which he argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. A progenitor and a paradigm founder in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's work was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic sub-discipline in economics. Several economists have hailed Georgescu-Roegen as a man who lived well ahead of his time, and some historians of economic thought have proclaimed the ingenuity of his work. In spite of such appreciation, Georgescu-Roegen was never awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, although benefactors from his native Romania were lobbying for it on his behalf. After Georgescu-Roegen's death, his work was praised by a surviving friend of the highest rank: Prominent Keynesian economist and Nobel Prize laureate Paul Samuelson professed that he would be delighted if the fame Georgescu-Roegen did not fully realise in his own lifetime were granted by posterity instead. In the history of economic thought, Georgescu-Roegen was the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's mineral resources will eventually be exhausted at some point. In his paradigmatic magnum opus, Georgescu-Roegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the carrying capacity of earth – that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels – is bound to decrease some time in the future as earth's finite stock of mineral resources is being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse, ultimately bringing about human extinction. Due to the radical pessimism inherent in his work, based on the physical concept of entropy, the theoretical position of Georgescu-Roegen and his followers was later termed 'entropy pessimism'. Early in his life, Georgescu-Roegen was the student and protégé of Joseph Schumpeter, who taught that irreversible evolutionary change and 'creative destruction' are inherent to capitalism. Later in life, Georgescu-Roegen was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly, who then went on to develop the concept of a steady-state economy to impose permanent government restrictions on the flow of natural resources through the (world) economy. As he brought natural resource flows into economic modelling and analysis, Georgescu-Roegen's work was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic sub-discipline in economics in the 1980s. In addition, the degrowth movement that formed in France and Italy in the early-2000s recognises Georgescu-Roegen as the main intellectual figure influencing the movement. Taken together, by the 2010s Georgescu-Roegen had educated, influenced and inspired at least three generations of people, including his contemporary peers, younger ecological economists, still younger degrowth organisers and activists, and others throughout the world. The inability or reluctance of most mainstream economists to recognise Georgescu-Roegen's work has been ascribed to the fact that much of his work reads like applied physics rather than economics, as this latter subject is generally taught and understood today. Georgescu- Roegen's work was blemished somewhat by mistakes caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics. These mistakes have since generated some controversy, involving both physicists and ecological economists.  Life and career  The life of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (born Nicolae Georgescu) spanned most of the 20th century, from 1906 to 1994. In his native Romania, he lived through two world wars and three dictatorships before he fled the country. Living in political exile in the US in the second half of his life, he witnessed at a distance the rise and fall of socialism in Romania. He made many important contributions to mainstream neoclassical economics before he finally turned against it and published his paradigmatic magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. Although this work was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic sub-discipline in economics, Georgescu-Roegen died disappointed and bitter that his paradigmatic work did not receive the appreciation he had expected for it in his own lifetime. = Childhood, adolescence and education = Nicolae Georgescu was born in Constanţa, Romania in 1906 to a family of simple origins. His father, of Greek descent, was an army officer. His mother, an ethnic Romanian, was a sewing teacher at a girls school. The father spent time teaching his son how to read, write and calculate, and planted in the boy the seed of intellectual curiosity. By her living example, the mother taught her son the value of hard work. After having lost his position in the army for disciplinary reasons, the father died when Nicolae was only eight years old. City of Constanţa in 1909 Constanţa was then a small Black Sea port with some 25,000 inhabitants. The mix of various cultures and ethnic groups in the town shaped Nicolae's cosmopolitan spirit from his earliest years. In primary school, Nicolae excelled at mathematics, and he was encouraged by a teacher to apply for a scholarship at a secondary school, the Lyceum Mânăstirea Dealu (\\"Lycée of the Monastery of the Hill\\"), a new military prep school in the town. Nicolae won a scholarship there in 1916, but his attendance was delayed by Romania's entry into World War I. His widowed mother fled with the family to Bucharest, the country's capital, where they stayed with Nicolae's maternal grandmother during the rest of the war. In these times of hardship, Nicolae had traumatic boyhood experiences of the agonies of war. He wanted to become a mathematics teacher, but he could barely keep up his schoolwork. After the war, Nicolae returned to his home town to attend the lyceum. Teaching standards were high, and many of the teachers later went on to become university professors, but the discipline was regimented, with mock-military physical exercises and wearing uniforms. Students were not permitted to leave the school except in summer and briefly during Christmas and Easter. Nicolae proved to be an excellent student, especially in mathematics. He later credited the five years of secondary education he received at the lyceum for providing him with an extraordinary education that would serve him well later in his career, but he also blamed the discipline and the monastic isolation of the place for having stunted his social abilities, something that would put him at odds with acquaintances and colleagues throughout his life. At the lyceum, it turned out that Nicolae Georgescu had a namesake. In order to avoid any confusion, he decided to create an addendum to his family name, made up of the first and the last letter of his first name, plus the first four letters of his last name, all six letters put in the reverse order: NicolaE GEORgescu → '-Roegen'. Georgescu-Roegen would retain this addendum for the rest of his life. Later in his life, he also changed his first name to its French and English form, 'Nicholas'. University of Bucharest c. 1921 Georgescu-Roegen received his diploma from the lyceum in 1923. Thanks to a scholarship awarded to children from poor families, he was soon after accepted at the University of Bucharest for further studies in mathematics. The curriculum there was conventional, and the teaching methods were much the same as those that had prevailed at the lyceum. At the university, he met the woman who would later become his wife for the rest of his life, Otilia Busuioc. To sustain himself during his studies, he gave private lessons and taught in a grammar school outside the city. After his graduation cum laude in 1926, he took the examination to qualify as a secondary school teacher and then accepted a teaching post for another year in his former lyceum in Constanţa. At the university, Georgescu-Roegen became closely acquainted with one of his professors, Traian Lalescu, a renowned mathematician of the day who had taken a special interest in applying mathematical methods to economic reality using statistics. Lalescu was concerned with the lack of adequate data needed to analyse Romania's economy, so he encouraged Georgescu-Roegen to pursue this line of research in further studies abroad. Georgescu-Roegen soon followed this piece of advice: In 1927 he went to France to study at the Institute de Statistique, Sorbonne in Paris. = Studying in Paris and London = Georgescu-Roegen's stay in Paris broadened his field of study well beyond pure mathematics. Not only did he attend the lectures of the best statistics and economics professors in France, he also immersed himself in the philosophy of science, especially the works of Blaise Pascal, Ernst Mach, and Henri Bergson. Daily life was not easy for a poor foreign student in a great city. The meager means he received from Romania could barely support even his most basic necessities, and French students habitually referred to all foreign students by the derogatory term métèques, 'strangers'. But his studies progressed splendidly: in 1930, Georgescu-Roegen defended his doctoral dissertation on how to discover the cyclical components of a phenomenon. He passed with extraordinary honour. Émile Borel, one of Georgescu-Roegen's professors, thought so highly of the dissertation that he had it published in full as a special issue of a French academic journal. While studying in Paris, Georgescu-Roegen learned of the work of Karl Pearson at University College in London. Pearson was a leading English scholar of the time, with a field of interests that coincided with Georgescu-Roegen's own, namely mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science. Georgescu-Roegen made arrangements to lodge with the family of a young Englishman he had met in Paris and left for England in 1931. During his stay in London, his hosts not only accepted Georgescu-Roegen as their paying guest, but also taught him the basics of the English language, in preparation for his studies in the country. Pearson's field of interests coincided with Georgescu-Roegen's own. When he approached Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu-Roegen was amazed with the informality and openness he found. There was no more feeling like a métèque, a stranger. Studying with Pearson for the next two years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu-Roegen's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two became friends, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu-Roegen to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so- called \\"problem of moments\\", one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither was able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu-Roegen was pleased by their joint effort nonetheless. While studying in London, Georgescu-Roegen was contacted by a representative of the US-based Rockefeller Foundation. Due to his past academic achievements, the foundation wanted to grant Georgescu-Roegen a research fellowship in the US. Georgescu-Roegen had earlier learned of the use of time series analyses by the then famous Harvard Economic Barometer at Harvard University, so he accepted the grant. The trip was put off for about a year, however, as he had more pressing obligations in Romania: He needed to conclude his first national editorial project, a 500 page manual on Metoda Statistică, and he had to care for his aging widowed mother who was in bad health. = Trip to the United States, meeting Schumpeter = In autumn 1934, Georgescu-Roegen went to the US. On arriving at Harvard University, he learned that the Economic Barometer had been shut down years before: The project had completely failed to predict the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and was soon abandoned altogether. After several failed attempts to find another sponsor for his research, Georgescu-Roegen finally managed a meeting with the professor at the university teaching business cycles to see if there were any other opportunities available to him. This professor happened to be Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter became Georgescu-Roegen's mentor at Harvard. Meeting Schumpeter at this point completely changed the direction of Georgescu- Roegen's life and career. Schumpeter warmly welcomed Georgescu-Roegen to Harvard, and soon introduced him to the now famous 'circle', one of the most remarkable groups of economists ever working at the same institution, including Wassily Leontief, Oskar Lange, Fritz Machlup, and Nicholas Kaldor, among others. Georgescu-Roegen was now in a stimulating intellectual environment with weekly evening gatherings and informal academic discussions, where Schumpeter himself presided as the 'ringmaster' of the circle. In Schumpeter, Georgescu-Roegen had found a competent and sympathetic mentor. Although Georgescu-Roegen never formally enrolled in any economics classes, this was how he became an economist: \\"Schumpeter turned me into an economist ... My only degree in economics is from Universitas Schumpeteriana.\\" While at Harvard, Georgescu-Roegen published four important papers, laying the foundations for his later theories of consume and production. The scholarly quality of these articles impressed Schumpeter. Georgescu-Roegen's trip to the US was not all spent at Harvard. He managed to obtain a modest stipend for himself and his wife Otilia that enabled them to travel about the country, journeying as far as California. Through Schumpeter's contacts, Georgescu- Roegen had the opportunity to meet Irving Fisher, Harold Hotelling, and other leading economists of the day. He also met Albert Einstein at Princeton University. During his stay, Georgescu-Roegen's relationship with Schumpeter developed. Realising that Georgescu-Roegen was a promising young scholar, Schumpeter wanted to keep him at Harvard. He offered Georgescu-Roegen a position with the economics faculty, and asked him to work with him on an economics treatise as a joint effort, just the two of them, but Georgescu- Roegen declined. He wanted to go back to Romania in order to serve his backward fatherland that had sponsored most of his education so far; besides, his return was expected at home. Later in his life, Georgescu-Roegen would regret having turned down Schumpeter's generous offer at this point in his career. In spring 1936, Georgescu-Roegen left the US. His voyage back to Romania came to last almost a year in itself, as he paid a long visit to Friedrich Hayek and John Hicks at the London School of Economics on the way home. He was in no hurry to return. = The Romanian 'exile' and the flight from there = From 1937 to 1948, Georgescu-Roegen lived in Romania, where he witnessed all the turmoils and excesses of World War II and the subsequent rise to power of the communists in the country. During the war, Georgescu- Roegen lost his only brother due to a fatal reaction to a tuberculosis vaccine. Upon his return from the US to Bucharest, Georgescu-Roegen was soon appointed to several government posts. His doctoral dissertation from Sorbonne as well as his other academic credentials earned him a respectable reputation everywhere, and his fine French and English skills were needed in the foreign affairs department. He became vice-director of the Central Statistical Institute, responsible for compiling data on the country's foreign trade on a daily basis; he also served on the National Board of Trade, settling commercial agreements with the major foreign powers; he even participated in the diplomatic negotiations concerning the reassignment of Romania's national borders with Hungary. Georgescu-Roegen engaged himself in politics and joined the pro-monarchy National Peasants' Party. The country's economy was still underdeveloped and had a large agrarian base, where the mass of the peasantry lived in backwardness and poverty. Substantial land reforms were called for if the most appalling inequalities between the rural and the urban parts of the population were to be evened out. Georgescu-Roegen put a persuasive effort into this work and was soon elevated to the higher ranks of the party, becoming member of the party's National Council. Georgescu-Roegen did only little academic work during this period of his life. Apart from co-editing the national encyclopedia, the Enciclopedia României, and reporting on the country's economic situation in some minor statistics publications, he published nothing of scholarly significance. Although he did reside in his native country, Georgescu-Roegen would later refer to this period of his life as his Romanian 'exile': The exile was an intellectual one for him. Bolshevism.\\" By the end of the war, Romania was occupied by the Soviet Union. A trusted government official and a leading member of an influential political party, Georgescu-Roegen was appointed general secretary of the Armistice Commission, responsible for negotiating the conditions for peace with the occupying power. The negotiations dragged out for half a year and came to involve long and stressful discussions: During most of the war, Romania had been an Axis power allied with Nazi Germany, so the Soviet representatives treated the commission as nothing but a vehicle for levying the largest possible amount of war reparations on the Romanian people. As the communists rose to power, the leading members of the National Peasants' Party were rounded up and put on show trial in 1947. Many were sentenced to life imprisonment. After the war, political forces in the country began encroaching on Georgescu-Roegen. Before and during the war, Romania had already passed through three successive dictatorships, and the fourth one was now imminent. Plenty of items on Georgescu-Roegen's track record were suitable for antagonising both the native Romanian communists and the Soviet authorities that still occupied the country: His top membership of the Peasants' Party, in open opposition to the Communist Party; his chief negotiating position in the Armistice Commission, defending Romania's sovereignty against the occupying power; and his earlier affiliation with capitalist US as a Rockefeller research fellow at Harvard University. Political repression in the country intensified as the rise to power of the communists was completing, and Georgescu-Roegen finally realised it was time to get away: \\"... I had to flee Romania before I was thrown into a jail from which no one has ever come out alive.\\" By the aid of the Jewish community – he had earlier risked his neck by helping the Jews during the Romanian part of the Holocaust – Georgescu-Roegen and his wife got hold of counterfeit identity cards that secured them the passage out of the country, surrounded by bribed smugglers and stowed away in the hold of a freighter heading for Turkey. Having visited Turkey before on official business, Georgescu-Roegen was able to use his contacts there to notify Schumpeter and Leontief at Harvard University in the US about his flight. Leontief offered Georgescu-Roegen a position at Harvard, and made the necessary arrangements for the couple in advance of their arrival there. = Settling in the United States, years at Vanderbilt University = After a journey from Turkey through continental Europe, Georgescu-Roegen and his wife reached Cherbourg in France, from where they crossed the Atlantic by ship. Georgescu-Roegen's arrival at Harvard in summer 1948 was something of a return for him there. Only now, the circumstances were very different from what they had been in the 1930s: He was no longer a promising young scholar on a trip abroad, supported and sponsored by his native country; instead, he was a middle-aged political refugee who had fled a communist dictatorship behind the Iron Curtain. Yet, he was welcomed at Harvard just the same, obtaining employment as a lecturer and research associate, collaborating with Wassily Leontief on the Harvard Economic Research Project and other subjects. This was not a permanent employment, however. While working at Harvard, Georgescu- Roegen was approached by Vanderbilt University, who offered him a permanent academic chair as economics professor. Georgescu-Roegen accepted the offer and moved to Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee in 1949. It has been argued that Georgescu-Roegen's decision to move from Harvard to the permanence and stability of the less prestigious Vanderbilt was motivated by his precarious wartime experiences and his feeling of insecurity as a political refugee in his new country. It has also been argued that Joseph Schumpeter had at this point lost most of his former influence that could have secured Georgescu- Roegen a permanent position at Harvard (Schumpeter died in 1950). Georgescu- Roegen remained at Vanderbilt until his retirement in 1976 at age 70. Except for short trips, he would never leave Nashville again. Vanderbilt University During his years at Vanderbilt University, Georgescu-Roegen pursued an impressive academic career. He held numerous visiting appointments and research fellowships across the continents, and served as editor of a range of academic journals, including the Econometrica. He received several academic honours, including the distinguished Harvie Branscomb Award, presented in 1967 by his employer, Vanderbilt University. In 1971, the very same year his magnum opus was published, he was honoured as Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association. In the early-1960s, Georgescu-Roegen had Herman Daly as a student. Daly later went on to become a leading ecological economist as well as the economists profession's most faithful, persistent and influential proponent of the economics of Georgescu-Roegen. However, Georgescu-Roegen, for his part, would later turn critical of his student's work (see below). The publication of Georgescu-Roegen's magnum opus in 1971 did not trigger any immediate debates in the mainstream of the economics profession, and the only review in a leading mainstream journal warned the readers against the \\"incorrect statements and philosophical generalisations\\" made by the author; but Georgescu-Roegen did receive four favourable reviews from heterodox, evolutionary economists. Meadows was the director of the Club of Rome project at MIT in 1970-72. Through the 1970s, Georgescu-Roegen had a short-lived cooperation with the Club of Rome. Whereas Georgescu-Roegen's own magnum opus went largely unnoticed by mainstream (neoclassical) economists, the report on The Limits to Growth, published in 1972 by the Club of Rome, created something of a stir in the economics profession. In the heated controversies that followed the report, Georgescu-Roegen found himself largely on the same side as the club, and opposed to the mainstream economists. Teaming up with a natural ally, he approached the club and became a member there. Georgescu- Roegen's theoretical work came to influence the club substantially. One other important result of the cooperation was the publication of the pointed and polemical article on Energy and Economic Myths, where Georgescu-Roegen took issue with mainstream economists and various other debaters. This article found a large audience through the 1970s. Later, the cooperation with the club waned: Georgescu-Roegen reproached the club for not adopting a definite anti- growth political stance; he was also sceptical of the club's elitist and technocratic fashion of attempting to monitor and guide global social reality by building numerous abstract computer simulations of the world economy, and then publish all the findings to the general public. In the early-1980s, the parties finally split up. Martínez-Alier has been a driving force behind both ecological economics and the degrowth movement. He has also published a historical study of various ecological theorists preceding Georgescu-Roegen. In continental Europe, Georgescu-Roegen and his work gained influence from the 1970s. When Georgescu-Roegen delivered a lecture at the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher Jacques Grinevald. The ensuing cooperation and friendship between the two resulted in the French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled Demain la décroissance: Entropie – Écologie – Économie (\\"Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy – Ecology – Economy\\"), published in 1979. Similar to his involvement with the Club of Rome (see above), Georgescu-Roegen's article on Energy and Economic Myths came to play a crucial role in the dissemination of his views among the later followers of the degrowth movement. In the 1980s, Georgescu-Roegen met and befriended Catalan agricultural economist and historian of economic thought Juan Martínez-Alier, who would soon after become a driving force in the formation of both the International Society for Ecological Economics and the degrowth movement. Since the degrowth movement formed in France and Italy in the early-2000s, leading French champion of the movement Serge Latouche has credited Georgescu-Roegen for being a \\"main theoretical source of degrowth.\\" Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist Mauro Bonaiuti has considered Georgescu- Roegen's work to be \\"one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.\\" Apart from his involvement with the Club of Rome and a few European scholars, Georgescu-Roegen remained a solitary man throughout the years at Vanderbilt. He rarely discussed his ongoing work with colleagues and students, and he collaborated in very few joint projects during his career. In addition, several independent sources confirm the observation that Georgescu- Roegen's uncompromising personality and bad temper made him a rather unpleasant acquaintance to deal with. His blunt and demanding behaviour tended to offend most people in academia and elsewhere, thereby undermining his influence and standing. On Georgescu-Roegen's formal retirement in 1976, a symposium in his honour was organised by three of his colleagues at Vanderbilt, and the papers presented there were later published as an anthology. No fewer than four Nobel Prize laureates were among the contributing economists; but none of the colleagues from Georgescu-Roegen's department at Vanderbilt participated, a fact that has since been taken as evidence of his social and academic isolation at the place. = Retirement, later years and death = After Georgescu-Roegen's formal retirement from Vanderbilt in 1976, he continued to live and work as an emeritus in his home in Nashville until his death in 1994. Through these later years, he wrote several articles and papers, expanding on and developing his views. He also corresponded extensively with his few friends and former colleagues. In 1988, Georgescu-Roegen was invited to join the editorial board of the newly established academic journal Ecological Economics, published by the International Society for Ecological Economics; but although most of the people organising the journal and the society recognised and admired Georgescu-Roegen's work, he turned down the invitation: He regarded both the journal and the society as nothing but vehicles for promoting concepts like sustainable development and steady-state economics, concepts he himself dismissed as misdirected and wrong (see below, both here and here). Georgescu- Roegen had more ambitious goals in mind: He wanted to overturn and replace the prevailing, but flawed, mainstream paradigm of neoclassical economics with his own 'bioeconomics' (see below); to downscale (degrow) the economy as soon as possible (see below); and not merely be relegated to some arcane and insignificant – so he believed – economics sub-discipline such as ecological economics. Georgescu-Roegen lived long enough to survive the communist dictatorship in Romania he had fled earlier in his life (see above). He even received some late recognition from his fatherland: In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent Romanian Revolution in 1989, Georgescu- Roegen was elected to the Romanian Academy in Bucharest. He was pleased by his election. His last years were marked by seclusion and withdrawal from the world. By now, Georgescu-Roegen was an old man. Although he had a productive and successful academic career behind him, he was disappointed that his work had not received the dissemination and recognition he had expected for it in his own lifetime. He believed he had long been running against a current. As he likened himself to one unlucky heretic and legendary martyr of science out of the Italian Renaissance, Georgescu-Roegen grumbled and exclaimed: \\"E pur si muove is ordinarily attributed to Galileo, although those words were the last ones uttered by Giordano Bruno on the burning stake!\\" He came to realise that he had failed in his life's work to warn the general public and change people's minds about the looming mineral resource exhaustion he himself was very concerned about. He finally grasped that philosophical pessimism may well be a stance favoured by a few solitary intellectuals like himself, but such a stance is normally shunned like a taboo in wider human culture: \\"[A] considered pessimist is looked upon as a bearer of bad news and ... is not welcomed ever ...\\", he lamented. Yet, in spite of his deep disappointment and frustration, he continued to write down and propagate his views as long as he was physically able to do so. By the end, his health deteriorated. He was becoming rather deaf, and complications caused by his diabetes rendered him unable to climb stairs. In his final years, he isolated himself completely. He cut off all human contact, even to those of his former colleagues and students who appreciated his contribution to economics. He died bitter and (almost) lonely in his home at the age of 88. His wife Otilia survived him by some four years. The couple had no children. In his obituary essay on Georgescu-Roegen, Herman Daly wrote admirably of his deceased teacher and mentor, concluding that \\"He demanded a lot, but he gave more.\\"  Work  In his work as an economist, Georgescu-Roegen was influenced by the philosophy of Ernst Mach and the later school of logical positivism derived from Mach. Georgescu-Roegen found that two of his other main sources of inspiration, namely Karl Pearson and Albert Einstein, also had a largely Machian outlook. \\"My philosophy is in spirit Machian: it is ... mainly [concerned] with the problem of valid analytical representations of the relations among facts.\\" Much of his criticism of both neoclassical economics and of Marxism was based on this outlook. Coming to the US after World War II, Georgescu-Roegen's background soon put him at odds with the dominant theoretical school of neoclassical economics in the country. Having lived in Romania, an underdeveloped and peasant-dominated economy, he realised that neoclassical economics could explain only those social conditions that prevailed in advanced capitalist economies, but not in other institutional settings. He was also critical of the increasing use of abstract algebraic formalism grounded in no facts of social reality. Both of these issues made him attentive to social phenomena that were either overlooked or misrepresented by mainstream neoclassical economic analysis. It has been argued that an unbroken path runs from Georgescu-Roegen's work in pure theory in the early years, through his writings on peasant economies in the 1960s, leading to his preoccupation with entropy and bioeconomics in the last 25 years of his life. =Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process= According to Georgescu-Roegen's own recollection, the ideas presented in his paradigmatic magnum opus were worked out in his mind over a period of twenty years or so before the final publication. The three most important sources of inspiration for his work were Émile Borel's monograph on thermodynamics he had read while studying in Paris (see above); Joseph Schumpeter's view that irreversible evolutionary change are inherent in capitalism; and the Romanian historical record of the large oil refineries in Ploieşti becoming target of strategic military attacks in both world wars, proving the importance of natural resources in social conflict.  The shortcomings of both neoclassical economics and of Marxism  Georgescu-Roegen outlines that both main streams of economic thought having dominated the world since the end of the 19th century – namely neoclassical economics and Marxism – share the shortcoming of not taking into account the importance of natural resources in man's economy. Hence, Georgescu-Roegen engages himself in an intellectual battle with two fronts.  The relevance of thermodynamics to economics  The physical theory of thermodynamics is based on two laws: The first law states that energy is neither created nor destroyed in any isolated system (a conservation principle). The second law of thermodynamics – also known as the entropy law – states that energy tends to be degraded to ever poorer qualities (a degradation principle). Georgescu-Roegen argues that the relevance of thermodynamics to economics stems from the physical fact that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy, only transform it. The usual economic terms of 'production' and 'consumption' are mere verbal conventions that tend to obscure that nothing is created and nothing is destroyed in the economic process – everything is being transformed. The science of thermodynamics features a cosmology of its own predicting the heat death of the universe: Any transformation of energy – whether in nature or in human society – is moving the universe closer towards a final state of inert physical uniformity and maximum entropy. According to this cosmological perspective, all of man's economic activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary heat death locally on earth, Georgescu-Roegen submits. This view on the economy was later termed 'entropy pessimism'. Some of Georgescu-Roegen's followers and interpreters have elaborated on this view.  Conceptions of scarcity  Introducing the term 'low entropy' for valuable natural resources, and the term 'high entropy' for valueless waste and pollution, Georgescu-Roegen explains that all the economic process does from a physical point of view is to irreversibly transform low entropy into high entropy, thereby providing a flow of natural resources for people to live on. The irreversibility of this economic process is the reason why natural resources are scarce: Recycling of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources plus an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as waste heat (according to the entropy law). The sun will continue to shine on earth for billions of years to come. Georgescu-Roegen points out that the earth is a closed system in the thermodynamic sense of the term: the earth exchanges energy, but not matter (practically) with the rest of the universe. Hence, mainly two sources of low entropy are available to man, namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the earth; and the flow of radiation, received from the sun. Since the sun will continue to shine for billions of years to come, the earth's mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy. Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the crust of the earth at a rate of our own choosing (practically), the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the earth at a constant and fixed rate, beyond human control, Georgescu-Roegen maintains. This natural 'asymmetry' between man's access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life: The busy urban life, on the one hand, is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals; the tranquil rural life, on the other hand, is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy. Georgescu-Roegen argues that this 'asymmetry' helps explain the historical subjection of the countryside by the town since the dawn of civilisation, and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this subjection properly into account in his theory of historical materialism. Modern mechanised agriculture relies heavily on mineral inputs. Georgescu-Roegen explains that modern mechanised agriculture has developed historically as a result of the growing pressure of population on arable land; but the relief of this pressure by means of mechanisation has only substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture – and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it – almost as dependent on earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu-Roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of earth is decreasing. In effect, overpopulation on earth is largely a dynamic long run phenomenon, being a by-product of ever more constraining mineral scarcities.  The production process and the flow-fund model  In the 1965 Georgescu-Roegen presented the flow-fund model at the Conference of the International Economic Association that took place in Rome. His analysis of the production process, based on the flow-fund model, highlights the relationship between productive efficiency and the organization of production thanks to the focus on the temporal and organizational aspects of production processes. According to Georgescu- Roegen’s definition, flows are utilized in only one process as input, or they can emerge from a single process as output. While, funds enter and leave the production process, providing their services in several processes over time (e.g., workers, land and capital equipment). In the fund-flow approach, the production process is represented by a functional: O(t) = Λ[G1(t), G2(t), ..., GI(t), F1(t), F2(t), ..., FH(t), U1(t), U2(t), ..., UK(t)], where O(t) is a function describing at any time t the cumulative quantity of the output (e.g. the total quantity of tables produced in the process of table production); Gi(t) are time functions indicating, at any t, the cumulative quantity of the i-th outflow (e.g. waste, secondary products, emissions); Fh(t) are time functions indicating the cumulative quantity of the h-th inflow; finally, Uk(t) are functions indicating, at any time t, the degree of use of the k-th fund. The conceptualization of the production process in the fund-flow model allows the consideration of the way in which indivisible and complementary inputs and processes are combined in order to minimize the inactivity times of tools, to increase degree of their utilization and to decrease the duration of processes. In particular Georgescu-Roegen shows that the flow-fund model makes it possible to analyze the differences between the agriculture production, craft production and industrial production (the factory system). The size of the production unit reflects the need to minimize both idle times and under- utilization of funds, by balancing the productive capacities in the different phases. In the presence of specialized and indivisible funds, that characterize industrial processes, a high volume of production is necessary to make compatible their different productive capacities and to overcome bottlenecks. Once a scale is established that eliminates idle time for equipment, any expansion has to occur at discrete jumps of multiples of the scale achieved. The factory system represents an attempt to overcome the problem of the indivisibility and complementarity, by reducing at minimum periods the idle times of funds. As stressed by Georgescu-Roegen, the factory system is not a technological innovation; it is rather an \\"economic\\" and organizational innovation. According to Georgescu-Roegen, it is, together with money, one of the most important organizational and economic innovations of human beings. From the ‘80s numerous economists have been working on Georgesu- Roegen’s flow-fund model.. In 1992 Mario Morroni presented a development of the flow-fund model for applied analysis. This model has been implemented in some case studies regarding the textile industry, electronic devices for telecommunication industry, shoe industry and tie industry. Georgescu-Roegen's model of the economy grew out of his dissatisfaction with neoclassical production theory as well as the input-output model of the economy, developed by Nobel Prize laureate Wassily Leontief. Georgescu-Roegen realised that production cannot be adequately described by stocks of equipment and inventories only, or by flows of inputs and outputs only. It was necessary to combine these two descriptions. In order to complete the picture, it was also necessary to add the new concept of a 'fund'. In Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund model of production, a fund factor is either labour power, farmland, or man- made capital providing a useful service at any point in time. A 'stock' factor is a material or energy input that can be decumulated at will; a 'flow' factor is a stock spread out over a period of time. The fund factors constitute the agents of the economic process, and the flow factors are used or acted upon by these agents. Unlike a stock factor, a fund factor cannot be used (decumulated) at will, as its rate of utilisation depends on the distinct physical properties of the fund (labour power and farmland, for instance, may run the risk of overuse and exhaustion if proper care is not taken). Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution. Contrary to neoclassical production theory, Georgescu-Roegen identifies nature as the exclusive primary source of all factors of production. According to the first law of thermodynamics, matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed in the economy (the conservation principle). According to the second law of thermodynamics – the entropy law – what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes to states unavailable for human purposes (the degradation principle). This transformation constitutes a unidirectional and irreversible process. Consequently, valuable natural resources ('low entropy') are procured by the input end of the economy; the resources flow through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; and unvaluable waste and pollution ('high entropy') eventually accumulate by the output end. Mankind lives in, by, and of nature, and we return our residues to nature. By so doing, the entropy of the combined nature-economy system steadily increases. The presence of natural resource flows in Georgescu-Roegen's model of production (production function) differentiates the model from those of both Keynesian macroeconomics, neoclassical economics, as well as classical economics, including most – though not all – variants of Marxism. Only in ecological economics are natural resource flows positively recognised as a valid theoretical basis for economic modelling and analysis. Later, Georgescu- Roegen's production model formed the basis of his criticism of neoclassical economics (see below).  Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)  Marx was optimistic about the future communist society; but Georgescu-Roegen objected that social conflict will never be eliminated. In his social theory, Georgescu-Roegen argues that man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of his biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This biological struggle has prevailed since the dawn of man, and the nature of the struggle was not altered by the invention of money as a medium of exchange. Unlike animals, man has developed exosomatic instruments, that is, tools and equipment. These instruments are produced by man and are not a part of his body. At the same time, production is a social, and not an individual, undertaking. This situation has turned man's struggle to sustain life and survive into a social conflict which is unique when compared to animals. Contrasting his own view with those of Karl Marx, Georgescu-Roegen asserts: When man (some men) attempts to radically change the distribution of access to material resources in society, this may result in wars or revolutions, Georgescu-Roegen admits; but even though wars and revolutions may bring about the intended redistributions, man's economic struggle and the social conflict will remain. There will be rulers and ruled in any social order, and the ruling is largely a continuation of the biological struggle of sustaining life and survive, Georgescu-Roegen claims. Under these material conditions, the ruling classes of past and present have always resorted to force, ideology and manipulation to defend their privileges and maintain the acquiescence of the ruled. This historical fact does not end with communism, Georgescu-Roegen points out; quite the opposite, it goes on during communism, and beyond it as well. It would be contrary to man's biological nature to organise himself otherwise. Later, Georgescu-Roegen introduced the term 'bioeconomics' (short for 'biological economics') to describe his view that man's economic struggle is a continuation of the biological struggle. In his final years, he planned to write a book on the subject of bioeconomics, but due to old age, he was unable to complete it. He did manage to write a sketch on it, though.  Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind  Georgescu-Roegen takes a dismal view of the future of mankind. On the one hand, his general argument is that the carrying capacity of earth – that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels – is decreasing as earth's finite stock of mineral resources are being extracted and put to use; but on the other hand, he finds that restraining ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of future generations runs counter to our biological nature as a species. We cannot help ourselves. Consequently, the world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse. From that point on, he predicts, ever deepening scarcities will cause widespread misery, aggravate social conflict throughout the globe, and intensify man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood. A prolonged 'biological spasm' of our species will follow, ultimately spelling the end of mankind itself, as man has already become completely and irreversibly dependent on the industrial economy for his biological existence. We are not going to make it. We are doomed to downfall, destruction, and demise. Predicts Georgescu-Roegen: Georgescu-Roegen's radically pessimistic 'existential risk' perspective on global mineral resource exhaustion was later countered by Robert Ayres (see below). = Work after magnum opus = In the years following the publication of his magnum opus in 1971 and until his death in 1994, Georgescu-Roegen published a number of articles and essays where he further expanded on and developed his views.  Criticising neoclassical economics (weak versus strong sustainability)  Criticising neoclassical economics, Georgescu-Roegen argues that neoclassical production theory is false when representing the economy as a mechanical, circular and closed system, with no inlets and no outlets. A misrepresentation such as this fails to take into account the exhaustion of mineral resources at the input end, and the building up of waste and pollution at the output end. In Georgescu-Roegen's view, the economy is represented more accurately by his own flow-fund model of production (see above). Solow is a leading growth theorist in the neoclassical tradition. In addition, Georgescu- Roegen finds that neoclassical economics tends to overlook, or, at best, to misrepresent the problem of how to allocate the exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations. Georgescu-Roegen points out that the market mechanisms of supply and demand are systematically unable to work out the intergenerational allocation problem in a satisfactory way, since future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. This anomaly of the market mechanisms – or ecological market failure – is described by Georgescu-Roegen as 'a dictatorship of the present over the future'. On this issue, notable economists and Nobel Prize laureates Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz, Georgescu-Roegen's two main adversaries in academia in the 1970s, have stated their account of the mainstream neoclassical approach to the economics of exhaustible resources: They both claim that across the board substitutability of man-made capital for natural capital constitutes a real possibility. Hence, any concern with intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock should be relaxed somewhat (according to Solow); or even ignored altogether (according to Stiglitz). The position of Solow and Stiglitz (as well as other, like-minded theorists in the neoclassical tradition) was later termed 'weak sustainability' by environmental economist Kerry Turner. The Breit–Wheeler process represents the only known example of a process where energy (photons) is transformed into mass (positron-electron pairs); but even in this special experimental case, the resulting elementary particles cannot combine to form atomic structures having economic value. A process where pure energy is transformed into useful materials remains to be discovered. In response to the position of Solow and Stiglitz, Georgescu-Roegen argues that neoclassical economists generally fail to realise the important difference between material resources and energy resources in the economic process. This is where his flow-fund model of production comes into play (see above). Georgescu-Roegen's point is that only material resources can be transformed into man-made capital. Energy resources, on the other hand, cannot be so transformed, as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter, and matter is what man-made capital is made up of physically. The only possible role to be performed by energy resources is to assist – usually as fuel or electricity – in the process of transforming material resources into man-made capital. In Georgescu-Roegen's own terminology, energy may have the form of either a stock factor (mineral deposits in nature), or a flow factor (resources transformed in the economy); but never that of a fund factor (man- made capital in the economy). Hence, substituting man-made capital for energy resources is physically impossible. Furthermore, not all material resources are transformed into man-made capital; instead, some material resources are manufactured directly into consumer goods having only a limited durability. Finally, in the course of time, all man-made capital depreciates, wears out and needs replacement; but both old and new man-made capital is made out of material resources to begin with. All in all, the economic process is indeed a process with steadily increasing entropy, and the 'mechanical' notion of across the board substitutability prevalent in neoclassical economics is untenable, Georgescu-Roegen submits. Contrary to the neoclassical position, Georgescu-Roegen argues that flow factors and fund factors (that is, natural resources and man-made capital) are essentially complementary, since both are needed in the economic process in order to have a working economy. Georgescu- Roegen's conclusion, then, is that the allocation of exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations is a large problem that cannot, and should not, be relaxed or ignored: \\"There seems to be no way to do away with the dictatorship of the present over the future, although we may aim at making it as bearable as possible.\\" Georgescu-Roegen's followers and interpreters have since been discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way – or only little way – of knowing in advance if or when mankind will ultimately face extinction. In effect, any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point. This approach to mankind's prospects is absent in neoclassical economics. The position of Georgescu- Roegen, including his criticism of neoclassical economics, was later termed 'strong sustainability' by Kerry Turner. Later still, Turner's taxonomy of 'weak' and 'strong' sustainability was integrated into ecological economics. However, contrary to the widely established use of Turner's simplifying taxonomy, Georgescu-Roegen never referred to his own position as 'strong sustainability' or any other variant of sustainability. Quite the opposite. Georgescu-Roegen flatly dismissed any notion of sustainable development as only so much 'snake oil' intended to deceive the general public. In his last years, he even denounced the notion bitterly as \\"one of the most toxic recipes for mankind\\": There can be no such thing as a 'sustainable' rate of extraction and use of a finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources – any rate will diminish the remaining stock itself. Consequently, the Industrial Revolution has brought about unsustainable economic development in the world (see below).  Criticising Daly's steady-state economics  Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly is a former student and protégé of Georgescu-Roegen. In the 1970s, Daly developed the concept of a steady-state economy, by which he understands an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (man-made capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a minimal flow of natural resources (or 'throughput', as he terms it). Daly argues that this steady- state economy is both necessary and desirable in order to keep human environmental impact within biophysical limits (however defined), and to create more allocational fairness between present and future generations with regard to mineral resource use. In several articles, Georgescu-Roegen criticised his student's concept of a steady-state economy. Mining activities are subject to diminishing returns. Georgescu-Roegen argues that Daly's steady-state economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially not in the longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the earth, prospecting for and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics will work itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu-Roegen points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu-Roegen also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state. Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring quantitative restrictions even more severe than those propounded by Daly. Herman Daly on his part has readily accepted his teacher's judgement on this subject matter: In order to compensate for the principle of diminishing returns in mineral resource extraction, an ever greater share of capital and labour in the economy will gradually have to be transferred to the mining sector, thereby skewing the initial structure of any steady-state system. Even more important is it that the steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion anyway. \\"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\\", Daly concedes in his response to Georgescu-Roegen's criticism. In the same turn, Daly confirms Georgescu-Roegen's general argument that earth's carrying capacity is decreasing as mankind is extracting the finite mineral stock. Likewise, several other economists in the field besides Georgescu-Roegen and Daly have agreed that a steady-state economy does not by itself constitute a long-term solution to the 'entropy problem' facing mankind.  Technology assessments in historical perspective  In his technology assessments, Georgescu-Roegen puts thermodynamic principles to use in a wider historical context, including the future of mankind. According to Georgescu-Roegen's terminology, a technology is 'viable' only when it is able to return an energy surplus sufficiently large to maintain its own operation, plus some additional energy left over for other use. If this criterion is not met, the technology in question is only 'feasible' (if workable at all), but not 'viable'. Both viable and feasible technologies depend on a steady flow of natural resources for their operation. Palaeolithic Era. Georgescu-Roegen argues that the first viable technology in the history of man was fire. By controlling fire, it was possible for man to burn a forest, or all forests. It was also possible to cook food and to obtain warmth and protection. Inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, Georgescu-Roegen terms fire 'the first Promethean recipe'. According to Georgescu-Roegen, a later important Promethean recipe (technology) of the same (first) kind was animal husbandry, feeding on grass and other biomass (like fire does). Prometheus II: The steam engine of the Industrial Revolution. Much later in the history of man, the steam engine came about as the crucial Promethean recipe of the second kind, feeding on coal. The invention of the steam engine made it possible to drain the groundwater flooding the mine shafts, and the mined coal could then be used as fuel for other steam engines in turn. This technology propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, whereby man's economy has been thrust into a long, never-to-return overshoot-and-collapse trajectory with regard to the earth's mineral stock. Georgescu-Roegen lists the internal combustion engine and the nuclear fission reactor as other, later examples of Promethean recipes of the second kind, namely heat engines feeding on a mineral fuel (oil and uranium (plus thorium), respectively). Prometheus III: Solar collectors returning a sufficiently large energy output. Georgescu- Roegen believed that no technology of this kind was yet around in the world in his day. By a Promethean recipe of the third kind, Georgescu-Roegen understands a solar collector returning a net energy output sufficiently large to supply all the energy input needed to manufacture an additional solar collector of the same kind, thereby constituting a full serial reproduction with regard to solar energy only. The fact that solar collectors of various kinds had been in operation on a substantial scale for more than a century without providing a breakthrough in energy efficiency brought Georgescu-Roegen to the conclusion that no Promethean recipe was yet around in the world in his day. Only feasible recipes for solar collectors were available, functioning like what he labelled 'parasites' with regard to the terrestrial inputs of energy for their manufacture and operation – and like any other parasite, these recipes cannot survive their host (the 'host' being the sources of the terrestrial inputs). Georgescu-Roegen believed that for a worldwide solar- powered economy to be truly energy self-supporting, a Promethean kind of solar collector had yet to be invented. Later, some scholars have argued that the efficiency of solar collectors has increased considerably since Georgescu- Roegen made these assessments. Georgescu-Roegen further points out that regardless of the efficiency of any particular kind of solar collector, the major drawback of solar power per se when compared to terrestrial fossil fuels and uranium (plus thorium) is the diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation. Hence, a lot of material equipment is needed as inputs at the surface of the earth to collect, concentrate and (when convenient) store or transform the radiation before it can be put to use on a larger industrial scale. This necessary material equipment adds to the 'parasitical' operation of solar power, Georgescu-Roegen maintains. By the 1990s, the technology of fusion power was still in the making. The research & development continues today... Assessing fusion power as a possible future source of energy, Georgescu-Roegen ventured the opinion that, regarding magnetic confinement fusion, no reactor will ever be built to be large enough to effectively withstand and confine the vehement thermal pressure of the plasmic deuterium/tritium fusion processes through an extended period of time. He did not assess the other one of the two major fusion power technologies being researched in his day – and still being researched – namely inertial confinement fusion. Will mankind remain confined to earth forever ... ? All of these technology assessments have to do with energy resources only, and not with material resources. Georgescu-Roegen stressed the point that even with the proliferation of solar collectors throughout the surface of the globe, or the advent of fusion power, or both, any industrial economy will still depend on a steady flow of material resources extracted from the crust of the earth, notably metals. He repeatedly argued his case that in the (far) future, it will be scarcity of terrestrial material resources, and not of energy resources, that will prove to impose the most binding constraint on man's economy on earth. As he held no space advocacy views, Georgescu-Roegen failed to assess the (still) emerging technology of asteroid mining or any other known type of space colonisation as potentials for compensating for this future scarcity constraint facing mankind: He was convinced that throughout its entire span of existence, our species will remain confined solely to earth for all practical purposes. His paradigmatic vision concluded thereby.  Mistakes and controversies  The entropy law does not apply to material resources. Georgescu-Roegen's work was blemished somewhat by mistakes caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics. While working on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (see above), Georgescu-Roegen had the firm understanding that the entropy law applies equally well to both energy resources and to material resources, and much of the reasoning in the opus rests on this understanding; but, regrettably for Georgescu-Roegen, this understanding was – and still is – false: In thermodynamics proper, the entropy law does apply to energy, but not to matter of macroscopic scale (that is, not to material resources). Later, when Georgescu-Roegen realised his mistake, his reaction passed through several stages of contemplation and refinement, ultimately leading to his formulation of a new physical law, namely the fourth law of thermodynamics. This fourth law states that complete recycling of matter is impossible. The purpose of Georgescu-Roegen's proposed fourth law was to substantiate his initial claim that not only energy resources, but also material resources, are subject to general and irreversible physical degradation when put to use in economic activity. In addition, he introduced the term 'material entropy' to describe this physical degradation of material resources. Planck had used the concept of 'matter dissipation' in some of his work. Georgescu-Roegen himself was not confident about this tentative solution to the problem. He remained embarrassed that he had misinterpreted, and consequently, overstretched the proper application of the physical law that formed part of the title of his magnum opus. He conceded that he had entered into the science of thermodynamics as something of a bold novice. Dedicated to interdisciplinarity, he was worried that physicists would dismiss all of his work as amateurism on this count. The predicament would trouble him for the rest of his life. In one of his last published articles before his death, Georgescu-Roegen described his encouragement when he had once earlier come across the concept of 'matter dissipation' used by German physicist and Nobel Prize laureate Max Planck to account for the existence of irreversible physical processes where no simultaneous transformation of energy was taking place. Georgescu-Roegen found consolation in the belief that the concept of 'matter dissipation' used by a physicist of Planck's authoritative standing would decisively substantiate his own fourth law and his own concept of material entropy. Georgescu-Roegen's formulation of a fourth law of thermodynamics and the concept of material entropy soon generated a prolonged controversy, involving both physicists and ecological economists; but some twelve to fifteen years after Georgescu-Roegen's death, a consensus on this subject matter finally emerged along the following lines: *There is only one measure of entropy in thermodynamics, and this one measure applies to both energy and to microscopic matter at the molecular level (kinetic gas theory); but the measure does not apply to macroscopic matter (matter in bulk, material resources), though it frequently appears so in the ecological economics literature and elsewhere. *The general physical degradation of material resources taking place in the economy can neither be explained nor described by the entropy law (Georgescu-Roegen's first mistake); but the fact remains that such physical degradation does take place all the time – continuously, irreversibly and in a variety of ways. *The fourth law of thermodynamics and the concept of material entropy as proposed by Georgescu-Roegen to redress his first mistake have no scientific basis in physics whatsoever, and it was a theoretical mistake by Georgescu-Roegen to make these propositions at all (Georgescu-Roegen's second mistake); but by itself, this does not imply that complete and perpetual recycling of material resources is possible, as it most probably is impossible on other grounds (see below). *Both of Georgescu- Roegen's mistakes were caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics. It is bad physics and equally bad economics to devise a new physical law (the fourth one) in order to make up for one's own insufficient understanding of a physical theory in the first place. Such a device may be bordering on pseudoscience. *Apart from these two mistakes, Georgescu-Roegen's work is still compliant with the first and second law of thermodynamics as already established in physics. In the same vein as this consensus, a full chapter on the economics of Georgescu-Roegen has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics, and the details (Georgescu-Roegen's mistakes) about the fourth law and material entropy are omitted there. Ayres countered Georgescu-Roegen's pessimism and argued in favour of a 'spaceship economy'. Modelling a possible future economic system for mankind, Robert Ayres has countered Georgescu-Roegen's position on the impossibility of complete and perpetual recycling of material resources. According to Ayres, it is possible to develop what he conceptualises as a 'spaceship economy' on earth on a stable and permanent basis, provided that a sufficient flow of energy is available to support it (for example, by an ample supply of solar energy). In this spaceship economy, all waste materials will be temporarily discarded and stored in inactive reservoirs – or what he calls 'waste baskets' – before being recycled and returned to active use in the economic system at some later point in time. It will not be necessary, or even possible, for materials recycling to form its own separate and continuous flow to be of use – only, the waste baskets in question have to be large enough to compensate for the rate and the efficiency of the recycling effort. In effect, complete and perpetual recycling of material resources will be possible in a future spaceship economy of this kind specified, thereby rendering obsolete Georgescu-Roegen's proposed fourth law of thermodynamics, Ayres submits. In a later article, Ayres restated his case for a spaceship economy. In ecological economics, Ayres' contribution vis-à-vis Georgescu-Roegen's proposed fourth law was since described as yet another instance of the so-called 'energetic dogma': Earlier, Georgescu-Roegen had attached the label 'energetic dogma' to various theorists holding the view that only energy resources, and not material resources, are the constraining factor in all economic activity. Ayres appears to be the odd man out on this subject matter: Whatever the scientific status and validity of Georgescu-Roegen's fourth law may be, several other economists in the field besides Georgescu-Roegen deny the practical possibility of ever having complete and perpetual recycling of all material resources in any type of economic system, regardless of the amount of energy, time and information to be assigned to the recycling effort.

The awards have two categories: The award for 'unconventional thinking' is presented for scholarly work in academia, and the award for 'bioeconomic practice' is presented for initiatives in politics, business and grassroots organisations. Japanese ecological economist Kozo Mayumi, a student of Georgescu-Roegen in 1984-88, was the first to receive the award in the 'unconventional thinking' category. Mayumi was awarded for his work on energy analysis and hierarchy theory.

This allows a home agent to forward messages to the mobile device. A separate address is required because the IP address of the device that is used as host identification is topologically incorrect—it does not match the network of attachment. The care-of address splits the dual nature of an IP address, that is, its use is to identify the host and the location within the global IP network. Address assignment The care-of address can be acquired by the mobile node in two different ways: * Foreign agent care-of address (FACoA): The mobile node receives the same CoA as the foreign agent. All mobile nodes in the foreign network are given the same CoA. * Co-located care-of address: Each mobile node in the foreign network is assigned its own CoA, usually by a DHCP server. This might happen in a network where the foreign agent has not been deployed yet. Given the imminent IPv4 address exhaustion, the first solution is more frequently chosen, because it does not waste a public IP address for every mobile node when changing network location, as the collocated CoA does. The care-of address has to be a valid IP address within the foreign network, so that it allows the mobile node to receive and make connections with any host in the outside. To send outgoing packets, the mobile node may as well use its home address but, since it is not a connected IP address for the current network attachment, some routers in the way might prevent the packets from reaching the destination. That is why, in IPv4, the outgoing information is transported to the home agent (which is in the home network) by means of an IP tunnel. From the Home Network, the packets of the Mobile Node can be sent using its original Home Address, without any routing problem. The Correspondent Node will send its information again to the Home Network. Thus, it has to be sent on through the tunnel to the foreign agent and then to the Mobile Node. When all mobile nodes share the same IP address with the foreign agent, this is implemented by the foreign agent acting as a proxy ARP., IP mobility support for IPv4Cisco IOS local-area mobility See also * Mobile IP  References  Network addressing ","title":"Care-of address"},{"id":"5006904","text":"The REWERSE Rule Markup Language (R2ML) is developed by the REWERSE Working Group I1 for the purpose of rules interchange between different systems and tools.

Australia Zoo located here is a major tourist attraction and is visited daily by large numbers of local, national and international tourists. Beerwah has transport links to Brisbane and northbound destinations at Beerwah railway station on the Nambour and Gympie North railway line. Roads in the area include a bypass in the south of the town, Kilcoy-Beerwah Road and Steve Irwin Way.  Geography  Beerwah is situated north of Glass House Mountains, approximately north of Brisbane, and just south of Landsborough. The main road through Beerwah is called Steve Irwin Way. It was formerly known as the Glasshouse Mountain Tourist Route and is accessed by the Bruce Highway, which bypassed the town in 1985. History The name Beerwah comes from the Kabi language (Turrbal dialect) word birrawaman, with birra meaning sky and wandum meaning climbing up. Beerwah Post Office opened by August 1907 (a receiving office had been open from 1891). The Coochin Creek Provisional School opened in November 1888, becoming Coochin Creek State School on 1 January 1909. In about November 1928, it was renamed Beerwah State School. On 10 July 1952, another Coochin Creek State School opened, but it closed on 11 March 1962. On Saturday 26 September 1914 the local Anglican residents held a meeting to consider erecting a church in Beerwah. Mr Mawhinney donated a piece of land by the raiilway station. On Saturday 7 November 1914 Archdeacon Henry Le Fanu officially capped the first stump of the new church building. All the materials for the church and the labour were all donated so the church would be free of debt. On Saturday 6 March 1916 Archdeacon Le Fanu returned to officially open and dedicate St James' Anglican Church. In the 1990s diminishing numbers in the congregations led to a decision to close a number of churches in the area. St James' was closed and sold for removal. On 4 July 1991 the Mary MacKillop Catholic Centre was blessed and opened by Archbishop Francis Rush. Beerwah State High School opened on 1 January 1992. The Beerwah Library opened in 2000.  Heritage listings  Beerwah has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 53 Beerwah Parade: Beerwah Hotel *2719 Old Gympie Road: Site of Coochin Homestead * Roys Road and Mawsons Road (Beerburrum State Forest): Beerburrum Scientific Area No 1 *Roys Road, approximately 1 km east of Mawsons Road intersection: former Beerwah Forest Station and Arboretum *Simpson Street: Beerwah railway station Transport Beerwah is a growing hinterland town. Transport links to Brisbane and northbound destinations at Beerwah railway station on the Nambour and Gympie North railway line. A small bypass was constructed south of the town, including an overpass of the railway, a large roundabout at Roberts Road, and traffic signals at Kilcoy-Beerwah Road and Steve Irwin Way. This work opened to traffic in October 2009. As part of that project, however, the original level crossing was closed and demolished, causing concern among local residents who claimed it sliced the town in two. In 2010, many residents began to complain about the lack of signage to the town center. The town entrance now features two distinctive large directional signs, one at the Steve Irwin Way entrance, and one at the roundabout after travelling over the railway bridge. Tourism Australia Zoo is located in Beerwah. The zoo was founded by Bob Irwin and later made famous by his son, Steve Irwin. It is a major tourist attraction and is visited daily by large numbers of local, national and international tourists. Another attraction, the Glass House mountain range, is located nearby. The largest mountain in the range, at 555m, is Mount Beerwah. Access to the Mount Beerwah summit route has been closed since 2008 due to the erosion and destabilization of some walking tracks, leading to a high risk of rock fall. The Big Mower, one of Australia's big things, is located in Beerwah. The Big Mower Education Beerwah has three schools: Beerwah State School, Beerwah State High School, and Glasshouse Christian College, a private college.  Amenities  The Sunshine Coast Regional Council operates a public library at 25 Peachester Road. There are a range of national supermarkets, specialty shops, and a retirement village. The Beerwah branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at 39 Simpson Street. Anglican church services are held at the Mary MacKillop Catholic Centre at 160 Peachester Road (). Demographics In the , Beerwah recorded a population of 6,769 people, 52% female and 48% male. The median age was 39 years, compared to the national median age of 38. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.8% of the population. 77.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.1% and New Zealand 4.8%. 90.8% of people only spoke English at home.

They comprise the Agamudayar, Kallar and Maravar social groups that share a common myth of origin and claim to have once been members of various ancient South Indian dynasties.  Origins and development The terms Mukkulathor and Thevar are used synonymously. According to R. Muthulakshmi of Madurai Kamaraj University, Thevar \\"literally means celestial beings or divine-natured people\\" and Mukkulathor means \\"three clans united together\\". The three constituent communities of Agamudayar, Kallar and Maravar believe themselves to share a common myth of origin formed through being the offspring of a relationship between Indra and a celestial woman. The three groups traditionally each believe themselves to be superior to their fellow Mukkulathors. While they share a common mythological ancestor, the three communities also claim ancestral differences. The Agamudayar consider themselves to be descendants of the Chera dynasty, while the Kallar claim descent from the Chola dynasty and the Maravars believe they are related to the Pandya dynasty. The anthropologist Susan Bayly notes that both the Kallar and Maravar communities are relatively new caste entities. Both names were originally granted to people as titles by poligars (local chieftains) but the holders were not exposed to caste-defining influences such as Brahmanic Hinduism, the concept of varna and practices such as endogamy until the late 18th century. She says that the claims of distinct caste status \\"were clearly not ancient facts of life in the Tamil Nadu region. Insofar as these people of the turbulent poligar country really did become castes, their bonds of affinity were shaped in the relatively recent past\\". Thereafter, the evolution as a caste developed as a result of various influences, including increased interaction with other groups as a consequence of jungle clearances, state-building and ideological shifts. Anthropologist Diane P. Mines affirms that the contemporary characterisation of the Thevar community derives from its precolonial past but was reified under the British Raj. For instance, in 1911 the British designated the Thevars a \\"criminal caste\\", which Mines surmises arose from the community's precolonial role as village guardians or local chieftains but was precipitated by their resistance to British rule. In the period following Indian independence, the Mukkulathor or the Thevars have grown into, what Mines calls, a \\"super-caste\\" that combines the three previously distinct communities, emphasises their similarities and shared historical roles, and forms a consolidated base of support for the AIADMK political party.  Demographics  The Mukkulathor communities live mostly in central and southern areas of Tamil Nadu, such as Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivagangai, Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchirapalli and Thirunelveli. They have been recorded as practising female infanticide as recently as the 1990s. Although the Mukkulathor own significant amounts of land, the sociologist Hugo Gorringe noted in 2005 that \\"their educational and economic achievements have been negligible\\", with many being small farmers or agricultural labourers. The community has mostly been given the status of Backward Class (BC) by the Government of Tamil Nadu, although some subgroups are omitted. They are mostly listed as Other Backward Classes (OBC) by the National Commission for Backward Classes.  Politics  Human Rights Watch has documented allegations that the members of the government of Jayalalitha, including the chief minister herself, favoured the Mukkalathors during the 1990s, leading to them gaining influential positions in the police and in politics. The Mukkalathor community at that time was the most populous of the backward classes in the state but Dalit communities - notably, the Pallars - were becoming increasingly wealthy and aspirational. The improvement of Dalit circumstances, together with a general rise in Dalit activism, led to many clashes with the Mukkulathors in rural areas. These clashes often involved the collusion of the police, who aided detention of so-called Dalit activists, assaults on people (especially women), and forcible displacement from Dalit villages. The Mukkulathors celebrate the coincident birth and death anniversary of U. Muthuramalingam Thevar (also spelled Mathuramaliga Thevar; 1908–1963) annually in October. He was a noted politician from the community and the event, known as Thevar Jayanthi, gained the approval of the Government of Tamil Nadu in 1993, which enabled the event to obtain police protection, road closures and the like. The Mukkulathors treat Muthuramalingam Thevar as a deity and it was from this time that the Jayanthi shifted from being a fairly minor affair to one of considerable significance. The Dalit surge since the 1980s was countered by the growth of the Jayanthi, which gave the Mukkulathors an opportunity to react against the Dalits and assert their own perceived superiority, historic status as rulers, and caste pride. Damodraran Karthikeyan, a journalist-turned-academic, notes the historic animosity between the two groups and that \\"The institutionalised nature of Thevar Jayanthi, through consciously created myths surrounding Mathuramaliga Thevar, his iconisation, canonisation and the construction of a social identity provides a point of entry to study the process of how political power is ritually constructed through social ceremony.\\"  Martial arts  Thevars, traditionally practise a Tamil martial art variously known as Adimurai, chinna adi and varna ati. In recent years, since 1958, these have been referred to as Southern-style Kalaripayattu, although they are distinct from the ancient martial art of Kalaripayattu itself that was historically the style found in Kerala. This and other displays of aggression are prominent during Thevar Jayanthi.  Notable people  *U.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Lordelo do Ouro e Massarelos. The population in 2011 was 22,270,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 3.64 km².Eurostat It overlooks the Douro river. Local landmarks include the São Martinho de Lordelo Church, the Serralves park and modern art museum, along with other modern architecture buildings. The church is very important to the local inhabitants and services are still held there.  History  The coat of arms tells the story of this riverside parish of Porto: the gold, the Arrábida Bridge, the farms and industry, and the wheel of St. Catherine. Lordelo do Ouro (\\"lordship of gold\\") got its name from the shipments of gold (ouro) arriving from the colonies in Africa and Brazil during the times of the Portuguese Empire. It is a small parish by the river, where the shipyards built many of the \\"naus\\" used by the Portuguese, first to break the Siege of Lisbon by the Castilians during the 1383-1385 Crisis which recognised John the Master of Aviz as the King of Portugal, and later as the first fleet on the Conquest of Ceuta (North Africa) by King John I. The riverside area has been renewed during Porto 2001 Culture Capital, but the smallish shipyards remain as Historical memories. On the hill top, the small Santa Catarina chapel still retains the inscription of its foundation in 1395, one year after the birth of Henry the Navigator, son of King John I, on the nearby Ribeira. The fashion of sea bathing during the 19th century caused the expansion of the city of Porto to the sea coast to the West, expanding the parish of Foz do Douro as a paradise for wealthy people. This development continued and was reinforced during the 20th century, especially after the Arrábida bridge was built in the 60's, increasing traffic and facilitating access to the westernmost part of Porto. Thus, Lordelo do Ouro was kept as a pristine parish with acres of cultivated land and shrubs forgotten between Foz to the West and the center of Porto to the East, until after the revolution. In the end of the 20th century, especially after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, the parish has changed a lot. All the acres of land were used to build new housing, especial for social purposes. Social housing (\\"bairros sociais\\" or \\"bairros camarários\\") was common during the António Salazar regime, but the revolution expanded it to a larger scale.  Sights  The chapel of Santa Catarina provides a glance over the ocean, the southern margin of Gaia, the bridge of Arrábida, and the remaining patches of green. Nearby, the church of Lordelo still rings its bells every hour. The Bessa Stadium (from Boavista Futebol Club), the former northern border of the parish, is no longer part of the parish, but the Botanical Garden marks the eastern border while the parish extends towards Foz to the West. The garden of Calém keeps a statue celebrating the fleet of the conquest of Ceuta, and sometimes flocks of migrating birds stop for a rest on the river boulders in front of the garden. The Museu Serralves is probably the most famous cultural spot of the parish.

It lies some west of Montpellier. Marseillan sits on a large lagoon, the Étang de Thau, and is the southern entreport for the Canal du Midi. The centre of the village lies within the lines of the old walls. There is a hotel and a number of cafes and restaurants. Marseillan Plage is a purpose-built holiday resort on the Mediterranean, some from Marseillan Ville. The port is a protected heritage site, and the altar and organ in the church are also listed. There has been virtually no new building in the heart of the village since the 17th century, and many of the houses date from the twelfth century. Until 1970 the vineyards came to the main boulevards built outside the line of the walls around 1870. Since then the population has grown from around 3,000 throughout the last 200 years to over 10,000 in 2010. This does not include those who have bought houses and villas in Marseillan but use them only as holiday homes. Expectation is that the population will top 14,000 by 2015. History There is dispute as to who exactly founded the village. Marseille claims that honour, largely due to the similarity between the names of the two towns. But both names are derived from the Greco/Phoenician Massaliotes who extended trading routes from the eastern Mediterranean. The Massaliotes certainly founded Marseille around 600 BC and, shortly after, Agde. Thus, Agde is said to be the second oldest town in France. The foundation of Marseillan, however, is less clear. As Agde is only away it seems most likely that the Agatois were the founders. In any case, the origins of all three places lie with the Greco/Phoenicians. And, either way, Marseillan is one of the oldest villages in France. The Romans established the port, and with the Via Domitia running close they also established a rest and recreation centre. Many legionnaires took their discharge at Marseillan, and with it a grant of land - on which they grew vines. Economy Marseillan's economy is founded on fish, wines, trade and visitors. This has always been so because from its foundation Marseillan has been a major trading centre, a port and a stopping-off point for travellers. =Trade= When the village was founded there was a clean inland waterway paralleling the Mediterranean - described as \\"une petite mer intérieure et tranquille\\". Thus sailors could make their way in safety from the Rhône to Marseillan. Thus from the beginning Marseillan was a trading post. Over the years this waterway silted up, forming the series of Etangs, the largest of which being the Étang de Thau, but then the Canal du Midi opened and Marseillan, as the Entreport, was a major beneficiary. It follows that from the very early days Marseillan had the four bases of trade that exist today. Much later Marseillan was linked by the Rhone-Sète Canal to the river Rhone and by the Canal du Midi to Toulouse and thence to the Atlantic at Bordeaux. Its location means that Marseillan became a crucial link in the network of canals that still encircle France. =Fishing= The Étang de Thau is shallow, with a bottom of foot-deep mud. The conditions are perfect for shellfish and 18 different sorts are fished from the Etang. As the water is Class A they can be eaten straightaway. Most notable are the oysters and the mussels. ‘Bouziques’ oysters, from the Étang, provide about 10% of France's annual oyster consumption. They are cultivated from oyster tables with one farmer able to bring up a family comfortably on the production from two tables. Mussels are taken from the rich band of mussel-friendly water that runs along the Mediterranean coast from Marseillan to Marseilles. Marseillan fishers work 3 km from the shore, with the Agatois in larger boats fishing further out. Sea fish are also caught in the Étang. They are carried in by the force of the current generated by the narrowness of the canals. (There are no tides on the Mediterranean, but the mass of water shifts dependent on the prevailing wind. Thus the level of the Étang is constantly shifting.) =Wines= Table wines are produced, with the most acceptable being Picpoul de Pinet - an attractive white wine with a slight green tint and a little sparkle. About a million bottles annually are produced by the cave co- operative. The Noilly Prat company came to Marseillan in 1853, and is still producing its vermouths on the same site. Mr Noilly had created the vermouth in Lyon in 1813. His son, with an English partner (Mr Prat), came to Marseillan to commercialise their product because the local wines were very suitable and the climate was ideal. =Visitors= Always a stopping point on the long routes along the Mediterranean shore Marseillan has provided travellers with a welcome since the village was founded. Today much of the village's prosperity comes from the summer visitors: holidaymakers in Marseillan Plage, day visitors to Marseillan Ville, houseboat visitors from the Canal du Midi and owners of holiday homes. To some degree even those northerners who have settled permanently are visitors. Certainly they make a substantial contribution to the local economy. Population Map Large view at Marseillan harbour Marseillan harbour at night Buildings =Fortification= The old village has remained unchanged through the centuries, and today's village is almost identical in shape to the one known in the Middle Ages. This is because Marseillan was a fortified village until late in the 18th century. From the second century BC Marseillan was protected by earthworks, but by Roman times it had a timber stockade. This was sufficient until Simon de Montfort and his army passed through during the Cathar Crusade. New stone fortifications then replaced the timber. The Château sat foursquare in the centre of the village, behind its own walls, whilst the village walls were themselves four-and-a-half metres high. There were four gates, six watchtowers and the village was moated. =Habitation= Most of the village houses are back-to-back. Typically they are of three storeys. A stable on the ground floor, living space on the first and fodder stored on the second. The rear rooms are without light or ventilation. With the houses protected from mosquitoes by zinc screens, and in the heat of the Midi, it must have been barely tolerable even to people born into the village. Today the mosquitoes have been eradicated, but it is still uncomfortable in the rear rooms in high summer. Most houses in the old village are small or very small. Their staircases are narrow, and twisty. Some larger homes were owned by the entrepreneurs who typically moved out of the village and into the main boulevards from around 1870. These new large homes were also working houses. Maisons de maître and maisons de vigneron have no particular architectural style, but they are all of two or three storeys, with the ground floor a working area. All have double doors to allow entry to the horse-drawn transport. Sometimes there was direct access from the rear of the house to the vineyards. Almost always there was a small kitchen garden and a pump. =Construction= Construction is typically of ‘torchis’ bricks made from sun dried clay and straw. There are no foundations because a metre down is the water table. Every house in Marseillan has rising damp. This is actually essential to the survival of the houses since they have to be built to withstand the climate changes. In the winter the ground expands, and in summer it contracts. The houses have to be able to flex to cope with these changes. So lime mixed with sand from the beach was used rather than cement (which hardly flexes), and cracks in the façade are normal. Some houses are built from soft limestone which was taken from the vineyards. Basalt, hard volcanic stone, is commonly used for door and window frames. It is not uncommon to find that houses have been adapted and renovated over the ages and many have several different building materials co-existing within the one building. Renovation is not a modern initiative, Marseillan houses have been renovated and adapted since they were first built. Today bathrooms have been added, but piped water and sanitation have only been in the village since 1958. Most houses had their private pump, however. Climate Marseillan enjoys an equable climate. Sheltered by the mountains of the Massif Central the weather systems from the north are seldom a problem. Marseillan has some 300 sunny days a year, and ground frosts (at worst) in mid-winter. From time-to-time a little snow falls, but this only dusts the ground and is gone by mid-day. Marseillanais make day trips into the mountains to experience snowballing and to make snowmen. The prevailing winds are from the south-west, and south. Marseillan receives the hot winds from the Sahara but does not suffer the pink sand that those winds carry out to sea. The Mistral blows down the Rhone valley and, although a northerly wind is sometimes referred to as a “mistral” it has none of the severity nor persistence of the true version. Of interest The Marseillanais have always taken their time over decisions, but have still been leaders in many areas. A hospital existed in 1100 and is still treating patients today (having had several homes over the years!). The maire (mayor) was elected in the village 200 years before this was required by Royal decree. Public schooling started in the mid-18th century. The school was co- educational from 1870 (but not the classes). The oldest stone Marianne in France was erected in 1878, following a wooden bust created in 1876. Marseillan voted to become secular some 10 years before the country as a whole. Women were allowed into one designated cafe from 1870 — again earlier than most other towns and villages.

The concrete girder bridge carries motor vehicles, and a grade-separated footpath and cycleway. History The bridge replaced the original Fig Tree Bridge, an iron truss swing bridge the site of which is located directly adjacent to the current bridge. The original bridge was opened in 1885, and formed part of the first project to provide a fixed crossing of Sydney Harbour. The project also included the first Gladesville Bridge (1881) and Iron Cove Bridge (1882). The earlier Fig Tree Bridge was located about to the west of the new bridge. Its southern abutment, which still exists, has a viewing platform accessible from the end of Joubert Street, Hunters Hill. The wheel that once operated the opening span stands in memorial. The bridge took an hour to open its iron structure. Four workers were required to get the gearwheel opening system going. Description The current Fig Tree Bridge, which opened in September 1963, was built in conjunction with the Tarban Creek and Gladesville bridges as part of the planned North Western Expressway linking the city with the future Sydney-Newcastle Freeway. The expressway was cancelled but the freeway grade road from the eastern end of the Gladesville Bridge, over Tarban Creek and ending at the northern end of Fig Tree Bridge has been maintained. The piers and deck were designed to allow an additional two lanes to be provided, and this can be seen in the eccentric camber of the deck, with the apex of the camber off-centre to the centreline of the deck. Although the North Western Expressway has not eventuated, along with the Tarban Creek and Gladesville Bridges, Fig Tree Bridge serves a vital role as part of the next crossing upriver from the Sydney Harbour Bridge of Sydney Harbour, and is therefore an alternative route northwest between the central business district and the lower north shore via Burns Bay Road. The bridge does not carry a toll. The Fig Tree Bridge is part of the Seven Bridges Walk, a fundraising event run by the Cancer Council of NSW. The event consists of a walking circuit that crossed seven of Sydney's bridges, including the Sydney Harbour, Pyrmont, Anzac, Iron Cove, Gladesville, and Tarban Creek bridges.

It has many flags which shows six draped flags of the country, three on each side, which are located before a palm tree and cannons on a green lawn. On the lawn various items are found, such as a drum, bugles, long guns, and ship anchors. Above the palm tree, there is a Phrygian cap placed as a symbol of freedom. The ribbon bears the motto: (\\"Unity Makes Strength\\"), which is also the motto of several other countries. This should not be confused with the national motto of Haiti, which according to the Constitution of Haiti is \\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\\" The oldest use of a symbol for Haiti is known since 1807. The symbol shows several national flags, with two cannons and palm trees. The symbol indicates the battle for independence of the republic. The motto, in French, means 'Strength through unity'. The use of the symbol was interrupted twice; once was during the period of Henri I. The then president Henri Christophe declared himself as the Emperor of Haiti and adopted a Royal Coat of Arms. On the yellow shield of the arm there was a phoenix rising from its flames with five-pointed stars around it, and the motto ' (I will rise in my ashes) inscribed on a ribbon outlining the shield. Two royally crowned lions supported both sides of the shield, and the motto ' (God, my cause and my sword) was placed on another ribbon at the bottom. In 1814 Henri I slightly changed his Royal Arm, the lions were removed and the motto was changed to a Latin one: ' (Reborn from the ashes).Haiti Another change occurred in 1849, when President General Faustin Soulouque crowned himself as Emperor Faustin I. He adopted new Imperial arms, showing two cannons and a French imperial eagle. Two lions were again used as supporters and the whole was placed in a purple mantle, with a motto similar to the one Henri I used: ' (God, my country and my sword). The emperor was forced to leave the country in 1859, and the old symbol was later restored. Ever since the composition has been the same, but the colors and items have changed somewhat. The coat of arms is on the national flag of Haiti, but not on its civil flag.

History =Beginning= In 1920, Gaspare and Josephine Genuardi owned a farm near Norristown, Pennsylvania and grew fruits and vegetables. The couple went around to their neighbors delivering produce to them. Gaspare and Josephine were the parents of nine children. Of the nine were Charlie, Frank, Tom, Joe, and Jim who helped out with the business. The five sons soon became known as the \\"Genuardi brothers\\" by the customers. The Genuardi family opened its first supermarket in Norristown in 1954, which until its closure was the oldest surviving Genuardi's in operation. The Genuardi family also maintains a nursery and florist in Norristown. =1950s, 1960s, and 1970s= The five Genuardi brothers expanded their supermarkets throughout the western Philadelphia suburbs, spanning Bucks, Delaware, Chester, and Montgomery counties. The company has never had any stores within Philadelphia city limits. In 1975, it acquired some former Pantry Pride (originally known as Food Fair) and A&P; stores, and more ex-A&P; properties rejected by Super Fresh in 1985. =1980s and 1990s= The chain's first surviving stores outside Norristown opened in the 1980s. As the 1990s approached, the five brothers decided to transfer ownership of the stores to a third generation of family, which consisted of Jim Jr., Joe Jr., Charles A., Larry, Tom Jr., Michael, Anthony, Skip, and David Genuardi. Charles A. was named President/CEO of Genuardi's Family Markets. Also during this time, it owned a discount grocery chain called Mad Grocer. In the late 1990s, the company expanded into Delaware and New Jersey. =Safeway buyout of Genuardi's Family Markets= In December 2000, news spread that the Genuardi family had sold the chain to Safeway. In the summer of 2004, all Genuardi's stores in Delaware were converted to the Safeway banner when they were unionized. Safeway already had stores of its own in southern Delaware. There were issues and local outrage over the Safeway takeover due to claims of price increases, the changeover of many products to Safeway's own brands, and the use of a loyalty card, which was not needed under Genuardi's previous ownership. Except for the Safeway conversions, Genuardi's remained non-union, despite heavy unionization in Safeway's other chains. =2000s and early 2010s downfall= Former Genuardis Store in Warrington, Pennsylvania In 2005, grocery delivery was added to select Genuardi's stores. This allowed customers to order groceries via the Genuardi's/Safeway websites and have it delivered by truck in a set time frame. Later on in the year, Genuardi’s closed two underperforming stores in East Windsor, New Jersey and Bensalem, Pennsylvania, the latter of which was converted to a ShopRite. During 2010, underperforming Genuardi's stores did not have their leases renewed and Safeway closed store locations in Newtown Square (Edgmont), Glen Mills, Chesterbrook, and Lansdale in Pennsylvania, and Voorhees in New Jersey. In September 2011, Safeway was looking to sell all or part of Genuardi's. Later that month, a sale of several of Genuardi's locations to Giant-Carlisle appeared to be imminent. On January 5, 2012, Giant announced its deal to acquire 15 Genuardi's Family Markets across the Philadelphia area in a $106 million deal. For three weeks in July 2012, Giant opened 5 of the former Genuardi's stores each week. Weis Markets announced on February 13, 2012, the purchase of three stores in Montgomery and Bucks counties.Panaritis, Maria. \\"Weis Markets to buy three Genuardi's stores.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. February 14, 2012. Retrieved on May 7, 2012. The three Weis stores opened on June 16, 2012. Although it was initially to be acquired by Giant, it was announced on June 6, 2012, that the Newtown store would instead become a McCaffrey's store. The Newtown store became a McCaffrey's on July 15. After failing to find a buyer for the location, the Cherry Hill store closed on August 4, 2012, and later became Whole Foods Market. The Barnegat and Egg Harbor Township/Northfield stores closed on December 12, 2012, the Barnegat store was to re-open as Safeway's sister chain Acme in 2016 and the Egg Harbor Township/Northfield store became JR's Fresh Market in 2015 but that closed in 2018. The Marlton store closed on February 12, 2013. The Audubon store, the last remaining store, closed on May 27, 2015. Acme Markets, the chain's long-time rival, announced in late 2015 it would reopen the closed Barnegat location as an Acme; this was made possible when Albertsons (Acme's parent firm) merged with Safeway earlier in the year, and Safeway continued to hold the location's lease long after it closed.

They have historically been attached to the South District. They went into abeyance in 1992 but were reconstituted in 2005. They played the first officially recognised Shinty match outside Scotland in 80 years on Saturday 22 July 2006 against the Highlanders.  History  The club was formed in 1874, being an amalgamation of London Northern Counties and London Scots. The club toured Scotland in 1909. The club entered for the Camanachd Cup in 1896 and scratched to Glasgow Cowal as they could not afford the trip to Glasgow. In earlier times play was held at Wimbledon Common, Parliament Hill, Kodak Grounds (Harrow) and also at Stamford Bridge, the current ground of Chelsea F.C.. Between 1873 and 1915 regular play was held on Good Friday and Boxing Day at Wimbledon. Of all the London clubs only London Camanachd continued until the 1920s and 1930s. The club lost many players in the Great War and this is commemorated by a war memorial in Crown Court Church in Covent Garden London. . London Camanachd War Memorial After a long period in abeyance it was re-formed in 1982 by Hugh O'Kane and Sean Reid, before folding again in 1992. Between 1982 and 1992 play was held at Northolt. The only trophy won was the Skeabost Horn in 1985. Semi finals of both the Balliemore and Bullough Cups were reached in 1984–85. Nine matches were played that year, more than in any other, and the Shinty Year Book Trophy was awarded for endeavour. As in its early years the club had the same difficulties in raising a team and finding money to travel to Scotland, local competitions were organised for such as Mr Macleod's Cup 1882, Inverness Association Cup (a silver-mounted ram's head) 1901, The Dewar Shield 1908, Young Cup 1913, London Challenge Cup donated by the chief, Mr R.T.S. Macpherson, in 1986. The club won this trophy for four years until 1990 when Fr. Murphy's G.A.A. won it. In 1991, Brian Boru, having entered every year, won it. The club's furthest advance in the Camanachd Cup was in 1984 when it lost to Skye in the quarter final. In 1989 the club donated the London Shield for the national juvenile play-off. Kilmory, Glasgow Highland and Scottish university teams have made the long trip to win the London Cup. There was some youth coaching done at Chipping Campden School in the 1970s and 1980s. In October 2004 a group of passionate individuals, originally from both sides of the border, decided to reform the club with both a women's and men's teams. They competed in the Bullough Cup, recording their first competitive win since abeyance against Aberdour. In 2007, the club won the Inverness 6s Rosedene Shield against Boleskine Camanachd. In 2008, the club entered both the Sutherland cup and the Bullough cup but in 2009 the team was not entered into competition. London entered the Bullough Cup in 2010 but did not fulfil their fixture. March 2011 began a new chapter in the club's history strengthened by the advent of the Cornwall Shinty Club in 2012 and Oxford Shinty Club in 2013. This has provided regular local opposition and allowed the contesting of the English Shinty Championships annually. The brief existence of teams in Northallerton and Nottingham provided further opportunities to play. London have entered the St. Andrews 6s and Edinburgh University 6s tournament annually as well as providing players to the English Shinty Team in the Bullough Cup each summer rather than enter their own team. They hold an open 12 a side tournament in London each year in the weeks following the Camanachd Cup final. 2012 Revival and spread of Shinty in England Although London is the traditional home for shinty in England, thanks to Highland exiles, and latterly Scottish university graduates basing themselves in the English capital, local oral history in Cornwall records the game being played amongst schoolchildren. The revival of the London club has sparked interest in Cornwall, and Cornwall were finally able to offer London some 'local' opposition in March 2012. London's success grew, and the side hosted a successful tournament in September 2011 featuring the hosts, Cornwall and the SCOTS Camanachd.http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/other-sports/spreading- gospel-is-proving-to-be-a-labour-of- love.18922432?_=fe9e18a612115b7a0b95141d9f31843e63e0a669 London have also played a composite rules game against Sean Treacy's GAA and Croydon Camogie Club and hope to continue fostering links with local opposition.https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.10151167552683557&type;=1 London Camanachd were also the unlikely stars of a sitcom pilot in December 2012.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151353906326043&set;=o.2234238556&type;=3&theater; The influence of the SCOTS and the tradition of England being run by Scottish university graduates has seen a resurrection of shinty in Northallerton as well under the name Northallerton Shinty Club.https://www.facebook.com/groups/northallertonshintyclub/?fref=ts London amalgamated with Northallerton and Cornwall as the \\"English Shinty Association\\" in order to enter the Bullough Cup in 2013, and were knocked out by Tayforth Camanachd in the first round.

He recorded 51 albums under his own name during his lifetime and was principally known for his innovative vocal improvisations. He was the recipient of the 1996, 1997, 2000, and 2001 Down Beat magazine readers' jazz poll for Best Male Vocalist and was also nominated five times for the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Jazz Performance.Jones, Peter. This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy (Equinox Publishing, 2018) He wrote lyrics to the jazz tunes \\"Stolen Moments\\" and \\"Red Clay\\". Early life Born in Syracuse, New York, in 1932, Murphy was raised in a musical family, his parents having met when his father was appointed director of the local Methodist Church choir. He grew up in the nearby small town of Fulton, New York, where his grandmother and then his aunt were the church organists. Opera was also a presence in the Murphy home. He started piano lessons at the age of seven.Matt Schudel, \\"Mark Murphy, jazz singer of freewheeling virtuosity, dies at 83\\", The Washington Post, October 24, 2015. In his teens, Murphy joined his brother Dwight's jazz dance band as the singer (and occasional pianist), influenced by Peggy Lee, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, June Christy, Anita O'Day, and Ella Fitzgerald. The Jazz pianist Art Tatum was another early influence. Murphy graduated from Syracuse University in 1953, having majored in Music and Drama. Whilst there he was spotted singing at the Embassy Club by Sammy Davis Jr, who invited him to perform a guest spot at his own gig shortly afterwards, and put him in touch with TV host Steve Allen. The following year Murphy moved to New York City, taking part-time jobs as he looked for work as an actor and singer. He appeared in productions for the Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera Company and a musical version for television of Casey at the Bat. He also twice took second place at Apollo Theatre amateur singing contests. The first albums Murphy was eventually introduced to record producer Milt Gabler, who was an artist and repertoire director (A&R;) for Decca. His resulting debut recording was Meet Mark Murphy (1956), followed closely by Let Yourself Go (1957). After disappointing album sales, in 1958 Murphy moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded three albums for Capitol Records, and had a minor hit single with \\"This Could Be the Start of Something\\". But this was not enough for him to be retained by Capitol, so he returned to New York in the early '60s. Here he recorded two albums for Riverside Records: the album Rah (1961) included \\"Angel Eyes\\", a version of Horace Silver's \\"Doodlin'\\", and \\"Green Dolphin Street\\", featuring Bill Evans, Clark Terry, Urbie Green, Blue Mitchell and Wynton Kelly as accompanists. His favorite recording to date, That's How I Love the Blues, soon followed. In 1963, Murphy hit the charts across the country with his single of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" and was voted New Star of the Year in Down Beat Magazine's Reader's Poll.\\"Mark Murphy\\", AllAboutJazz. Around this time he fell under the spell of Miles Davis, and for the rest of his career maintained that he tried as far as possible to sing like Miles played. London In 1963 Murphy moved to London, England, where he quickly found acceptance and played frequently at Ronnie Scott's Club, as well as making regular appearances on BBC Radio. He recorded three more albums in London, and one in Germany that is amongst his best - Midnight Mood (1968). From London he made frequent trips to Holland, where he worked on Dutch radio, mainly with producer Joop de Roo. Between 1964 and 1972 he acted in a number of drama productions for TV and radio, and appeared as a singer in the 1967 British comedy film Just Like a Woman. Meanwhile he continued to cultivate his jazz audiences in Europe, singing in clubs and on radio. It was in London that Murphy, who was gay, met his long-time partner Eddie O'Sullivan. The Muse years He returned to the States in 1972 and began recording an average of an album per year for more than 14 years on the Muse label. These included the Grammy-nominated albums Satisfaction Guaranteed, Bop for Kerouac and Nat's Choice: Nat King Cole Songbook Vol. II. Murphy's other highly regarded Muse recordings include Bridging a Gap (featuring Ron Carter, Jimmy Madison, Randy Brecker and Michael Brecker), Mark Murphy Sings (again featuring the Brecker Brothers along with David Sanborn), Living Room, Beauty And the Beast and Stolen Moments. Bop for Kerouac (1981), with Richie Cole and Bill Mays, was a result of Murphy's enthusiasm for the writing of Jack Kerouac, whom Murphy regarded as a soul-mate. It included readings from the author's books On the Road and The Subterraneans. Murphy followed it up with Kerouac Then And Now, released in 1989. Having been a fan of Brazilian music since the late 1950s, in 1984 together with the band Viva Brasil he recorded the album Brazil Song (Cancões do Brasil), which featured work by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Milton Nascimento. He wrote lyrics for the title track, by Oliver Nelson, of his Stolen Moments album, and it quickly became a radio favourite, remaining one of his most popular recordings. New directions In 1987, Murphy continued his explorations of Brazilian music by recording Night Mood, an album of songs by composer Ivan Lins, followed by the Grammy-nominated September Ballads - both on Milestone Records. In the UK Murphy's recorded output gained a new lease of life in the mid-Eighties during the acid jazz dance craze. DJ's, principally Gilles Peterson, played his bop and latin recordings at club nights, creating a new generation of Mark Murphy fans. He continued to work extensively in Europe, recording in Germany, Holland, Austria, England, Italy, France, Sweden, Denmark and Slovenia, often as a guest artist. Murphy also appeared on UFO's last two releases (for Polydor Records), in which he wrote and rapped lyrics on songs composed with the group. This collaboration opened up further new audiences in the acid-jazz and hip-hop genres, demonstrating jazz's timelessness while transcending generations and styles. In August 1997, BMG/RCA Victor released Song For The Geese, for which he received his fifth and final Grammy nomination. In that same month, the 32 Records label released a double CD anthology Stolen and Other Moments, which features some of his recordings for the now defunct Muse label. The CD features material from the two \\"Kerouac\\" albums and a selection of \\"the best of Mark Murphy\\". It was followed by three further anthologies. After Muse boss Joe Fields sold the label and set up HighNote Records in its place, Murphy recorded five more albums for the new label, including Some Time Ago (2000), Links (2001) and Memories of You (2003). Murphy's release Once to Every Heart (2005) on Verve, features sensuous ballads, where the listener can hear him singing at the top of his form, with an orchestra arranged by Nan Schwartz. It was one of the best-selling albums of Murphy's career. In 2007 Verve released Love is What Stays. Both albums were produced by German trumpeter Till Brönner. Murphy also collaborated with Tenth & Parker, a modern UK electronica/acid jazz group on their Twenty:Twelve (2001) album; plus the Five Corners Quintet, a modern Finnish jazz band, appearing on their albums Chasin' the Jazz Gone By (2005) and Hot Corner (2008). In 2010 he released the independently produced CD, Never Let Me Go, accompanied by pianist Misha Piatigorsky, bassist Danton Boller and drummer Chris Wabich. The CD contains all songs he selected, mostly ballads, and was the first time he recorded Bill Evans' \\"Turn Out The Stars\\". Murphy also participated as a guest on The Royal Bopsters Project by Amy London, Darmon Meader, Dylan Pramuk, and Holli Ross, recorded in 2012 and released in 2015 by Motema Music. His final recording was a limited edition EP/MP3, A Beautiful Friendship: Remembering Shirley Horn on Gearbox Records, released in 2013. Murphy continued to tour internationally into his 80s, appearing at festivals and concerts, in jazz clubs and on television programs, throughout the U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan and elsewhere. John Bush at AllMusic.com described Murphy as \\"a major name in vocal jazz.\\" A longtime resident of the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey, he died there on October 22, 2015.Roberts, Sam. \\"Mark Murphy, an Unconventional Jazz Vocalist, Dies at 83\\", The New York Times, October 25, 2015.

Kolonga is a hereditary estate of Lord Nuku. The current population of Kolonga was recorded in the Tonga 2006 Census as 1,199.Tonga Department of Statistics. 2006. Tonga 2006 Census. Population Distribution By Division, District, Village By Population Change, Tonga: 1996 and 2006. Many people have left to go overseas for better opportunities. Many lands have been deserted or they leave it to the care of their relatives, sending money support back home. The majority of the residents owned two lands: one in town where they reside and one agricultural land in the bush. Nearly 99% of the population are agricultural farmers, out of that population only 60% own some level of qualification to a degree. Only a few have government jobs, while the rest make money out of their farming supplies at Nuku'alofa, the capital city of Tonga. History The name Kolonga did not exist till later on, there were two names that were known; Ualako (old residence home of Lord Nuku) and the name Mesimasi. =Estate history= Kolonga village has always been the home and land of Lord Nuku and his people since the installation of Ngata, Tu'i Kanokupolu. In 1875, when King Tupou I declared the Tongan Constitution, Lord Nuku was elevated from being an ancient chiefly titleholder to established hereditary noble. The title, Nuku, has always been passed from the oldest brother to the youngest, not from father to son. Before King Tupou I left for war to Fiji, he entrusted, Lord Nuku Momoiangaha, to be the King’s Guard at the Royal Palace. When he returned, he was very upset to hear that Moimoiangaha had granted permission for a catholic church in his land. Therefore the title was stripped off. The title landed among the children of Finauvalevale Finefeuiaki, the youngest brother. His son, Fatanitavake Finefeuiaki, was called to the title but he refused. He along with his sister, Tu’inavu Finefeuiaki, journeyed with Prince Henele Ma'afu 'o Tu'i Tonga to Lau Islands, Fiji. Than the title was bestowed to his brother, Lord Nuku Nehasi Finefeuiaki, since then the title went from father to son. Lord Nuku Nehasi Finefeuiaki died leaving no male heir. Than the title went to his brother, Lord Nuku Sosaia Finefeuiaki and his son, Lord Nuku Pulu Finefeuiaki. After he died, the title returned to the descendant of Lord Nuku Nehasi Finefeuiaki. Not long after the matter was taken to court. The investigation revealed, Lord Nuku Makoni Kailahi, was a descendant through the female line in three generations. The Tongan Constitution ruled him out and the title reverted to the descendants of Lord Nuku Sosaia Finefeuiaki. There was also a dispute over the title during the time of Lord Nuku Penisimani Katavake Naufahu Finefeuiaki. Sione Vao (Illegitimate descendant of Fatanitavake Finefeuiaki) and his relatives arrive from Fiji to claim the title. The Tongan Constitution already ruled them out, due to his ancestor, Fatanitavake, signed away his birthright. While Lord Nuku Fe’ao Finefeuiaki was still alive, his cunning brother-in-law, Sione Senior Kite was a very shrewd man from Fakakai village, Ha’apai Islands. He brought hundreds of people from Ha’apai Islands, and granted them land at Kolonga, without Lord Nuku's permission. By then it was too late, this angered Lord Nuku Fe’ao Finefeuiaki, and he stripped everything off him, including their land and sent them to Nuku’alofa, Tongatapu. The Ha'apai people that remained behind led Lord Nuku Fe'ao Finefeuiaki, to divide the land among them and granted them registered land ownership (since they were innocent). =Origin of the name= One historical interpretation is that Kolonga was, at one time, a collection of huts. Kolonga got its name during the battle between the people from the Hahake and Hihifo District of Tongatapu during the Tu'i Tonga Empire. As the Hihifo people were winning the battle, the Hahake people retreated and escaped to the middle of the Hahake District. The Hihifo District people found the large hut, the people hiding in it and they burnt the hut down. As the people were crying, a Chief’s Representative (Talking Chief) Nifofa was coming from Nautoka and he asked a person, “What is that sound coming from?” the person answered, “Koe kolo ‘oku nga, ‘uhinga koe kolo ‘oku tangi”, translating “The town is weeping meaning the town is crying”. Once the large hut was burned down, the battle was over and everyone return to the villages where they came from. Therefore, the village was named Kolonga. It is also said; the name Kolonga also had its origin from the Kanokupolu village, Hihifo District of Tongatapu and the Three Heads (‘Ulutolu). When Ngata was first crowned Tu’i Kanokupolu by the rebel people, he sat on the sia beneath the koka tree in the middle and both Niukapu and Nuku sat on the ground known as Kolonga. =Other names for Kolonga= The metaphoric reference to Kolonga is Lotopoha, Sialehaevala and 'Utulongoa'a. Sialehaevale (gardenia; torn clothes), originated when Tu'i Tonga Fefine arrived in Kolonga and climbed up the gardenia tree. As she climbed up the tree to pick a flower, her clothes torn apart, this gave rise to the name. 'Utulongoa'a (shore/cliff; noisy) Kolonga was that loud and noisy during the night, the Tu'i Tonga Fefine couldn’t sleep. She grew tired of the noise that it turned out, the sound of the waves keep on crashing against the cliffs. This is another possible reason, the capital Heketa was moved to Mu'a by Tu'i Tonga at a later date. Tongan proverb The word Kolonga features in the Tongan proverb, Ala-i-sia-ala-i-Kolonga (Mahina 2004),Mahina, 'O. 2004. Reed Book of Tongan Proverbs: Ko E Tohi 'A E Reed Ki He Lea Tonga Heliaki. United Kingdom: Reed. translated as, skillful at the mound, skillful at the hut. This indigenous proverb derived its meaning from the pigeon trappers’ practice of heu lupe, the snaring of pigeons. The mound on which the pigeons were trapped was called sia, and the temporary huts where the men resided and stored the captured pigeons were called kolonga. The proverb in vernacular language would be written as, Ala 'i sia, ala 'i kolonga. The meaning thus paid tribute to the trapper who was not merely skillful in snaring pigeons, but also skillful at storing and preserving the birds. The proverb referred to individuals who possessed the ability to successfully function in multiple contexts, a trait held in high regard by early Tongans. Relevant to the village characteristic of Kolonga and present day descendants, the proverb captured an element of wisdom known to the early Tongans. That is, humans have greater success at surviving if they are adaptable, skillful and functional in more than one environment.Malimali, S. 2005. Trochus Resources: A New Fishery in Tonga?

At the , Streaky Bay recorded a population of 1,625. The town of Streaky Bay is the major population centre of the District Council of Streaky Bay, and the centre of an agricultural district farming cereal crops and sheep, as well as having established fishing and tourism industries. History The first European to sight the area was Dutch explorer Pieter Nuyts, in 1627 in the Golden Zeepaard. A monument has been erected on the median strip in Bay Road. In 1802 Matthew Flinders named Streaky Bay whilst on his voyage in the Investigator. In his log of 5 February 1802, he describes: \\"And the water was much discoloured in Streaks... and I called it Streaky Bay\\" It is now thought these streaks are caused by the release of oils by certain species of seaweed in the bay. The first European land exploration was conducted on behalf of the Secondary Towns Association by John Hill and Samuel Stephens, whose expedition arrived at Streaky Bay on 15 August 1839 using the chartered brig Rapid as a base.Register, 26 October 1839, pp.5 and 17. A fortnight later, on 25 August 1839, Edward John Eyre, who had explored overland from Port Lincoln, arrived at this locality and established a small base about 3 kilometres from what is now the Streaky Bay Township which he used as a store for his overland expeditions to Point Bell. This site, known as Eyre's Waterhole, is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register, and can still be seen today just off the Flinders Highway. Pastoralists moved into the area from 1854. The town was officially proclaimed in 1872, originally called Flinders, but was changed in 1940 to Streaky Bay to reflect local usage of the name. Wheat growing began in the 1880s and by 1906, 31,000 bags of wheat and 470 bales of wool had been exported from Streaky Bay by ship. By this time a telegraph office had been established and regular mail deliveries were made from Port Lincoln. In September 1918, a massive blue whale over 26 metres long, was cast onto rocks on Gibson's Peninsula. Its skeleton is still on display in the South Australian Museum. Geography Cape Bauer, north-west of Streaky Bay Streaky Bay and the surrounding district show a great variety of landscapes, from largely untouched native scrubland and farming country to cliffs and extensive surf beaches. The inland areas of the district are largely dominated by pastoral country; however areas such as the Calpatanna Waterhole Conservation Park located 30 km SE of Streaky Bay represents an example of the original coastal and salt lake environments, where wildlife still abounds. Possibly the areas most interesting geological features are Murphy's Haystacks. These pink granite formations have been dated at 1590 million years old. The features that most commonly draw tourists are along the immense stretch of coastline surrounding the bay. The Bay itself is relatively protected and quiet stretches of beach can be found along most of its length. However, where the coastline is exposed to the swells of the Southern Ocean, cliffs are exposed, along with sheltered areas that harbour large rockpools, such as Smooth Pool and The Granites. The islands of the Nuyts Archipelago lie to the north-west. Streaky Bay has a mild climate with the average a few degrees above Adelaide in summer and winter with an average rainfall of 378 mm per year. The township of Streaky Bay is situated on the southern end of the bay, on an enclosed inlet named Blanche Port (after Lady Blanche MacDonnell, the wife of Governor George MacDonnell) or Augusta Harbor. Climate Streaky Bay has a subtropical mediterranean climate with warm and often hot summers with a long dry season, coupled by a moderately wet and mild winter season. Due to its proximity to the vast desert to its north, Streaky Bay is prone to getting extremely hot extreme temperature in spite of its seaside position. However, the same geographical position tends to reduce summer relative humidity compared to many other mediterranean climates. The hottest temperature was recorded at 47.8 °C on 24 January 2019. Economy Agriculture and fishing have long been the primary industries of the Streaky Bay region, with modern aquaculture now playing a large part in the local economy. The local economy is strongly dominated by agriculture, with an emphasis on wheat, barley and other cereals as well as sheep. Due to the relatively arid conditions, dryland farming techniques are successfully applied. Recent diversification has seen the successful testing of Damara sheep, Boer goats and olives which all offer potential future investments. Commercial fishing has played a major role in the economy of the area since the early 1900s, with Snapper and King George Whiting being the main targets of fishermen. More recently, aquaculture of oysters and abalone has also expanded and thrived in the waters of Streaky Bay. Tourism is an ever-growing component of the local economy, with town numbers swelling during the summer holidays and at Easter. Tourists are attracted by the many natural attractions of the area as well as a host of recreational activities. The most popular of these is undoubtedly recreational fishing, with hundreds of anglers flocking to the area to sample the renowned whiting on offer. Beach, rock and boat fishing are available, with a recently built boat ramp to cater for the boaters wishing to explore the area. King George whiting, Snapper and Blue Swimmer Crabs are the most commonly targeted species, with many more available. Other activities include hiking, surfing, snorkelling and scuba diving, with guided charters being available. Community Pie chart showing religion in Streaky Bay as it was in 2001 In the , Streaky Bay had a population of 1,625. The majority (86%) of residents were born in Australia; with the other 223 born overseas, primarily in the United Kingdom. The most common response for religion was \\"No Religion\\" 26.6%, followed by Catholic 22.7%, and Anglican 17.2%. There are several churches in the area as well as a variety of active sports clubs, including football, cricket, bowls, netball, golf and a swimming pool. The district has strong health and education services in the form of the Streaky Bay Hospital, the local Area School and public library. Government Streaky Bay and its districts, including settlements such as Sceale Bay comprise the District Council of Streaky Bay local government area. Streaky Bay is included in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal division of Grey. Transport Transport to and from Streaky Bay is usually done by car via the Flinders Highway, but bus services to and from Adelaide do operate, as does the Streaky Bay Airport. The Streaky Bay Airport is situated approximately 10 kilometres to the east of the town (Streaky Bay to Port Lincoln Highway). The facilities are open 24 hours a day with pilot activated, fully automated lighting facilities available. From 17 April 2009 Banksia Adventures will start a charter service to Adelaide with a plane from Renaissance Air every Friday and Sunday plus one morning and evening return flights on the third Wednesday of each month Residents and visitors are able to also access flights from either Ceduna Airport or Port Lincoln Airport.

Biography Quarracino was born in Pollica, Province of Salerno, Italy. His family emigrated to Argentina when he was 4 years old, settling in the town of San Andrés de Giles in the province of Buenos Aires. Quarracino was ordained priest on 22 December 1945, and became a professor at the diocesan seminary of Mercedes. He also taught theology at the Universidad Católica Argentina. He was appointed Bishop of Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires, by Pope John XXIII, on 3 February 1962, and received the episcopal see on 8 April of the same year. On 3 August 1968 Paul VI moved him to the diocese of Avellaneda (whose new cathedral was built during his rule). John Paul II promoted him to the Archdiocese of La Plata on 18 December 1985, and then on 10 July 1990 to the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, a see to which is attached the title of Primate of Argentina. He was elected to preside over the Argentine Episcopal Conference in the following November, and then reelected until 1996. He was elevated to Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria della Salute a Primavalle in consistory on 28 June 1991. On 27 June 1992 he was the principal consecrator of Jorge Mario Bergoglio, S.J., later Pope Francis, as bishop. Quarracino died in 1998 at the age of 74, due to a cardiac arrest. He was succeeded automatically by his coadjutor bishop, the Jesuit Jorge Mario Bergoglio. Views =Inter-religious dialogue with Jews= Quarracino was a major figure of inter-religious discussion with Jews. During a visit to Israel in 1992 he was decorated by Jewish institutions for this cause, and in 1997 he had a mural painting set up in the Cathedral of Buenos Aires commemorating the victims of the Holocaust and the bombings of the Israeli Embassy and the AMIA. =Social communications= Quarracino was inclined to journalism and, while in La Plata, he renewed the informative magazine of the archdiocese, transforming it into a full-fledged cultural publication. As Bishop of Buenos Aires, he appeared on TV regularly; he was in charge of a segment in a religious program (Claves para un mundo mejor) in the state-owned channel ATC. =Dirty War= Quarracino was outspoken about controversial topics. One of his first notable public statements was his support, in 1982, of a project of law that would end all investigation of the crimes of the Dirty War, in order to \\"contribute to national reconciliation\\". This can be seen as a precedent of the Ley de Punto Final, sanctioned in 1986. =Argentine politics= Quarracino was opposed to the policies of president Raúl Alfonsín (1983–1989) and accused politicians of corruption, as the cause of \\"national poverty\\". However, he acknowledged being a friend of president Carlos Menem (1989–1999) who was heavily criticized by other Church leaders (such as Cardinal Primatesta). =Homosexuality= In 1994, during his TV segment in ATC, Quarracino spoke against homosexuality saying that lesbians and gay men should be \\"locked up in a ghetto\\". This caused an accusation of discrimination, which was not considered by justice because anti-discrimination Law 23592 did not cover sexual orientation. Three years before he had termed homosexuality \\"a deviation of human nature, like bestiality\\".Página/12 El páis Happy together Domingo, 28 de agosto de 2005 =Boca Juniors= The Cardinal was an avowed fan of the Boca Juniors football team. When he celebrated his 50 years of priesthood he received a Boca Juniors shirt signed by all the team members.

Terms such as nutrient rich and micronutrient dense refer to similar properties. Several different national and international standards have been developed and are in use (see Nutritional rating systems). Definition and usage According to the World Health Organization, nutrient profilingNutrient Profiling: Report of a WHO/IASO Technical Meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, accessed 10/15/2014. classifies and/or ranks foods by their nutritional composition in order to promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease.Nutrient Profiling, accessed 10/15/2014 Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy. Ordering foods by nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing foods by the proportion of nutrients in foods. Some such comparisons can be the glycemic index and the Overall Nutritional Quality Index. When the density is defined in proportion to energy contents, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits and vegetables are the opposite of energy-dense food (also called \\"empty calorie\\" food), such as alcohol and foods high in added sugar or processed cereals.Hunter, J. G., Cason, K. L., Nutrient Density, Clemson University, 2006(November), accessed 10/15/2014. Nutrient density is defined as \\"a measure of the nutrients provided per calorie of food, or the ratio of nutrients to calories (energy).\\"Darmon, N., Darmon, M., Maillot, M., Drewnowski, A., A Nutrient Density Standard for Vegetables and Fruits: Nutrients per Calorie and Nutrients per Unit Cost, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 105(12),2005 (December), 1881–1887, DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2005.09.005, accessed 10/15/2014 Beyond its use to distinguish different types of food from each other, nutrient density allows comparison to be made for different examples or samples of the same kind of food.

So even a diet based on a lot of high-density products could still lack several essential nutrients. =Choice of nutrients included in the measure= # If all essential nutrient or micronutrients are included in the measure, it will remove focus from the nutrients that are most often lacking in people's diets. # If a selection of nutrients is made (e.g. based on how often they are lacking in people's diets), the selection will not be relevant to everyone, because some people lack completely different nutrients.

It was first described from Cowee Valley, Macon County, North Carolina. The name is derived from the Greek \\"rhodon\\" for \\"rose-like\\", in common with other pink mineral types (e.g. rhodochrosite, rhodonite). This coloration, and the commonly inclusion-free nature of garnet from this locality, has led to rhodolite being used as a gemstone. Rhodolite like other varietal names is not officially recognized as a mineralogical term, but rather used as an accepted trade name. Gemmological properties Mineralogically and chemically, rhodolite garnets are members of the pyrope- almandine solid-solution series, with an approximate bulk garnet composition of Py70Al30. Rhodolites from different occurrences around the world have been characterized by crystal chemical and absorption spectral analysis showing that besides iron such elements as manganese, chromium and vanadium may effect the colour of rhodolites. Rhodolite garnets appear as transparent red-pink- purplish gemstones, including all the different colour shades between violet and red. The colors from different rhodolite sources may vary from a lavender pink to raspberry rose or raspberry red and from purplish-violet (grape) to purplish red. The color of rhodolites, combined with their brilliance, durability, and the accessibility of stones with no visible inclusions have brought about some demand for the stone in the jewelry industry. Rhodolites used in jewelry are generally faceted to make good use of their brilliance, though they also exist in cabochon form. Some rhodolites will change color from purplish to a hessonite brown when heated to a temperature of 600 °C. This process cannot be reversed. Natural sources Many deposits of economic importance are found in countries that belong to the geological unit of the so called “Mozambique belt”, such as Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, etc. Other sources of rhodolites are in Brazil, India ( Odisha ), Norway, United States and Sri Lanka.Rhodolite on mindat.org References Garnet group Garnet gemstones ","title":"Rhodolite"},{"id":"5007318","text":"Protégé is a free, open source ontology editor and a knowledge management system.

It was formulated in 1929 by Alexander Oppenheim and later the conjectured property was further strengthened by Harold Davenport and Oppenheim. Initial research on this problem took the number n of variables to be large, and applied a version of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The definitive work of Margulis, settling the conjecture in the affirmative, used methods arising from ergodic theory and the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups.  Short description  Meyer's theorem states that an indefinite integral quadratic form Q in n variables, n ≥ 5, nontrivially represents zero, i.e. there exists a non-zero vector x with integer components such that Q(x) = 0\\\\. The Oppenheim conjecture can be viewed as an analogue of this statement for forms Q that are not multiples of a rational form. It states that in this case, the set of values of Q on integer vectors is a dense subset of the real line.  History  Several versions of the conjecture were formulated by Oppenheim and Harold Davenport. * Let Q be a real nondegenerate indefinite quadratic form in n variables. Suppose that n ≥ 3 and Q is not a multiple of a form with rational coefficients. Then for any ε > 0 there exists a non-zero vector x with integer components such that Q(x) < ε. For n ≥ 5 this was conjectured by Oppenheim in 1929; the stronger version is due to Davenport in 1946. * Let Q and n have the same meaning as before. Then for any ε > 0 there exists a non-zero vector x with integer components such that 0 < Q(x, x) < ε. This was conjectured by Oppenheim in 1953 and proved by Birch, Davenport, and Ridout for n at least 21, and by Davenport and Heilbronn for diagonal forms in five variables. Other partial results are due to Oppenheim (for forms in four variables, but under the strong restriction that the form represents zero over Z), Watson, Iwaniec, Baker–Schlickewey. Early work analytic number theory and reduction theory of quadratic forms. The conjecture was proved in 1987 by Margulis in complete generality using methods of ergodic theory. Geometry of actions of certain unipotent subgroups of the orthogonal group on the homogeneous space of the lattices in R3 plays a decisive role in this approach. It is sufficient to establish the case n = 3. The idea to derive the Oppenheim conjecture from a statement about homogeneous group actions is usually attributed to M. S. Raghunathan, who observed in the 1970s that the conjecture for n = 3 is equivalent to the following property of the space of lattices: * Any relatively compact orbit of SO(2, 1) in SL(3, R)/SL(3, Z) is compact. However, Margulis later remarked that in an implicit form of this equivalence occurred already in a 1955 paper of Cassels and H. P. F. Swinnerton-Dyer, albeit in a different language. Shortly after Margulis's breakthrough, the proof was simplified and generalized by Dani and Margulis. Qualitative versions of the Oppenheim conjecture were later proved by Eskin–Margulis–Mozes. Borel and Prasad established some S-arithmetic analogues. The study of the properties of unipotent and quasiunipotent flows on homogeneous spaces remains an active area of research, with applications to further questions in the theory of Diophantine approximation.

Cohen is an advocate of human rights in China, and has taken active roles in securing the release of Song Yongyi and Chen Guangcheng from under Chinese custody. His former students include Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, and Annette Lu, former Taiwanese vice president under Chen Shui-bian.  Chinese name  Cohen was originally known in Chinese as Kong Jierong (), giving him the same family name as Confucius. Mainland Chinese communists rejected this name, however, along with the Confucian values it evoked. Cohen was thus renamed 柯恩 (pinyin: Kē'ēn), a phonetic translation, although he remained known as Kong Jierong in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Early career Cohen was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and spent his early years in Linden, New Jersey, the son of a local government attorney. Cohen received his B.A. degree from Yale University in 1951 where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Following graduation, he spent a year in France as a Fulbright scholar studying international relations before returning to Yale and earning his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1955. While at Yale, he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Law Journal. From 1955–56 he clerked at the Supreme Court, first under Chief Justice Earl Warren and then under Justice Felix Frankfurter. Career in China Cohen joined the faculty of University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1959. It was here that he was asked to find a candidate for a four-year grant to study China offered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and, when no clear candidate emerged, decided to pursue the opportunity himself. He began studying the Chinese language, but as Americans were not permitted to enter China at the time, he could only travel as far as Hong Kong, where he met with refugees and questioned them on Chinese criminal procedure. These interviews served as the basis for his book, \\"The Criminal Process of the People's Republic of China: 1949–1963.\\" In 1964, Cohen became a Professor at Harvard University School of Law, where he would remain for 17 years, and created the school's East Asia Legal Studies Association. During this time, Cohen advocated for normalized relations with China, and was influential in securing the release of John T. Downey in the early 1970s. Downey, a former classmate of Cohen's from Yale, had been held in a Chinese prison since the Korean War, accused of being a CIA operative. In 1972, Cohen was able to make his first trip to the Chinese mainland as part of a delegation of the Federation of American Scientists and was able to meet with Premier Zhou Enlai. In 1977, he accompanied Senator Ted Kennedy to Beijing where they met with Deng Xiaoping. Following China's economic reforms in 1979, Cohen's obscure specialty of Chinese law was thrust into the spotlight as foreign companies began to consider investment opportunities. When he was offered the opportunity to live and practice in Beijing in exchange for teaching American contract law to commerce officials, Cohen took a sabbatical from Harvard. When the sabbatical concluded in 1981, he decided to remain in China and work at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Following the suppression of student uprising in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Paul Weiss closed its Hong Kong Office, and Cohen returned to the United States where he became a Professor of Law at New York University School of Law in 1990. He concurrently serves as Of Counsel for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. At NYU, he established the U.S.-Asia Law Institute, dedicated to facilitating the development of the rule of law throughout Asia. Human rights work Over the course of his career, Cohen has been a tireless advocate for human rights. In addition to striving for legal reforms in China, he has been instrumental in realizing the release of political prisoners, including Song Yongyi, a librarian at Dickinson College who was charged in China for selling intelligence overseas after he mailed newspapers, books, and Red Guard posters to the U.S. He regularly uses his bi- weekly column in the South China Morning Post as a platform to criticize rights violations in China and Taiwan. Cohen assisted and advised Chinese civil rights activist Chen Guangcheng, after Chen escaped from house arrest in 2012. After a series of negotiations between the U.S. and Chinese governments, Chen was allowed to travel to the U.S. and become a fellow at New York University.\\"Prominent legal scholar and China expert comes to aid of Chen Guangcheng\\", Daniel de Vise and William Wan, The Washington Post, May 5, 2012.BBC News (2012). China dissident Chen Guangcheng arrives in the US. Retrieved 20 May 2012. Cohen also serves on the Board of Directors for the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. Taiwan Cohen's influence has been particularly strong in Taiwan where his former student, Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) was president from 2008 to 2016. In 1985, Cohen played a key role in securing the release of political prisoner Annette Lu (呂秀蓮) who had been a student of Cohen's at Harvard and who would later become vice-president of Taiwan. Cohen asked his former student Ma Yingjeou who was now secretary to the Republic of China's President Chiang Ching-kuo to intervene. Lu had been sentenced to 12 years in prison. A week after Cohen arrived in Taiwan, Lu was freed. Ma has never commented on his role in Lu's release but Cohen is grateful. Also in 1985, following the murder in San Francisco of Henry Liu, a Taiwanese-American author critical of the martial law government, Cohen served as a pro-bono representative of Liu's widow at the trial in Taipei. On appeal of what he thought was a show trial convicting reputed gangsters, he sought to show that the government was directly involved in the plot. The sentences were upheld, and later, Taiwan's chief of military intelligence was also convicted for his involvement. Korea In 1972, Cohen became the first American academic to visit North Korea. In South Korea, Cohen was able to intervene in the kidnapping of Kim Dae-jung (김대중), who would later become president and receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In August, 1973, Cohen received an urgent call from Kim's aide, telling him that Kim had been kidnapped by Korean intelligence officials in Tokyo and imploring Cohen to request Henry Kissinger's help. Cohen did and Kim's life was saved, although Kim later reported that he had been bound and blindfolded aboard a boat with weights tied to his wrists, before the execution was suddenly called off.

It was located to the east of Utik on Araxes and was divided into 12 cantons (gavars), which were at the time in possession of Atropatene: *Hrakot-Perozh (centre: Paytakaran) *Vardanakert (centre: Vardanakert) *Rot-i-Bagha *Hani *Atshi- Bagavan (centre: Bagavan) *Kaghan-Rot *Koekyan *Aros *Vormizd-Perozh *Pichan (centre: Pichan) *Spandaran-Perozh (centre: Spandaran) *Alevan (centre: Alevan)  History  Prior to becoming Paytakaran, the region was known as Caspiane by Greco-Roman authors. Caspiane was contested between the regional powers. According to Strabo: \\"To the country of the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane, which was named after the Caspian tribe, as was also the sea; but the tribe has now disappeared.\\" Strabo also mentions Caspiane among the lands conquered by king Artashes I from Medes in the 2nd century BC. However, Armenia later lost it to Caucasian Albania about 59 BC, when Pompey rearranged the political geography of the region,Redgate, Anna Elizabeth. The Armenians (Peoples of Europe).

In the 360s AD, a fierce rebellion engulfed Paytakaran but it was later put down by sparapet Mushegh Mamikonian. After the partition of Armenia in 387, it remained a part of eastern Armenia until 428 (following the dissolution of the Armenian Arshakuni kingdom) and was added to Atropatene. The region was non-Armenian by ethnic composition.Hewsen. Armenia, p. 102. The population apparently consisted of Iranian speakers, such as the tribe of Parrasians.

It screens more than 300 films, documentaries and shorts from approximately 50 countries. History At a dinner party in 1953 at the home of film critic Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times and at which film administrator James Quinn attended, the notion of a film festival for London was raised. Quinn went on to start the first London Film Festival which took place at the new National Film Theatre (now renamed BFI Southbank) from 16–26 October 1957. The first festival screened 15–20 films from a selection of directors to show films successful at other festivals, including Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (which opened the festival), Satyajit Ray's Aparajito, Andrzej Wajda's Kanał, Luchino Visconti's White Nights, Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, Federico Fellini's Nights of Cabiria and Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd. The first edition was sponsored by The Sunday Times. The second edition was held from 6–14 October 1958 and saw the introduction of the Sutherland Trophy which was awarded to Yasujirō Ozu for Tokyo Story. The third festival featured François Truffaut's The 400 Blows, for which he turned up without a ticket and unable to speak English. Richard Roud became festival director in 1960, which was also the first year that a British film was shown at the festival; the world premiere of Karel Reisz's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. The fourth edition also featured Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura and Truffaut's Shoot the Pianist. The 1962 festival featured the first midnight matinee, Tony Richardson's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Roman Polanski's first feature-length film Knife in the Water and Jean-Luc Godard's Vivre sa vie were also screened. A new strand of the festival was added in 1965 called London Choices, featuring debut and lesser-known features, with one of the first of these being Dear John directed by Lars-Magnus Lindgren. 1967 saw the first features films directed by women screened - Shirley Clarke's Portrait of Jason, Agnès Varda's Les Créatures and Věra Chytilová's Daisies. Jean-Luc Godard's first English language film, One Plus One, was shown under the London Choices strand in 1968 and he punched producer Iain Quarrier in the face, for the changes made to the film. =1970–1983= Ken Wlaschin became festival director in February 1970 and expanded the size and diversity of the festival. His first festival ran 16 November to 2 December 1970 and featured 28 films, opening with Truffaut's L'Enfant sauvage and featuring Kurosawa's Dodes'ka-den and the world premiere of Anthony Friedman's Bartleby. David Lynch's short film The Grandmother was also shown in 1970. The 1971 festival ran 15 November to 1 December and was expanded to include a directors' section, featuring the premiere of Mike Leigh's feature film debut Bleak Moments. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was screened in 1974 in a members-only screening due to it not being classified by the BBFC. Similar screenings were held for The Beast in 1975 and Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom in 1977. The 1979 festival ran 15 November to 2 December, opening with Those Wonderful Movie Cranks directed by Jiří Menzel. The 1980 festival was held between 13–30 November, opening with Kurosawa's Kagemusha and closing with Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. The 1982 festival opened 11 November 1982 with 4 independent British films - Claude Whatham's The Captain's Doll, Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract, Barney Platts-Mills' Hero and Mai Zetterling's Scrubbers \\\\- and closed 28 November. =Expansion= In 1984, Wlaschin's role as program director for the National Film Theatre (NFT) and festival director was split, with The Guardian film critic Derek Malcolm taking over as festival director, initially temporarily, and Sheila Whitaker as NFT program director. Malcolm expanded the festival to 8 theatres other than the NFT; introduced Festival on the Square, showing more popular films; added a surprise film each year and increased attendances, trying to change it from a festival for film buffs to one for the public. The 1984 festival opened with Gremlins at the NFT on 14 November and closed on 2 December with a gala presentation at the Dominion Theatre of a new print of the 1924 version of The Thief of Baghdad starring Douglas Fairbanks with the score composed and conducted by Carl Davis. It was the most popular festival to date with 57,000 tickets sold and Malcolm was retained to organize the festival the following year. The 1985 festival was expanded to feature 161 films and ran from 14 November to 1 December, opening with Akira Kurosawa's Ran and closing with Michael Cimino's Year of the Dragon and Peter Greenaway's A Zed & Two Noughts. The best films of the festival were to be shown around 15 towns around the country after the event. The films were grouped into regional categories – in 2009 these were; Galas and Special Screenings, Film on the Square, New British Cinema, French Revolutions, Cinema Europa, World Cinema, Experimenta, Treasures from the Archives, Short Cuts and Animation. Since 1986, the festival has been \\"topped and tailed\\" by the Opening and Closing galas which have now become major red carpet events in the London calendar and are often world, European or UK premiere screenings, which take place in large venues in central London, attended by the cast and crew of the films, and introduced by the Festival director and the film's directors or producers, and often the actors themselves. The 30th edition of the festival in 1986 opened with Nicolas Roeg's Castaway and closed with a Royal charity performance of Labyrinth attended by Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales. =1987–1996= Sheila Whitaker, who had been the manager of the National Film Theatre, replaced Malcolm in 1987. The 1987 festival was the first to open at the Empire, Leicester Square on 11 November 1987. It was due to open with A Prayer for the Dying, a film about an IRA member but was pulled 2 days before the opening following the IRA's Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen on 8 November. The film was replaced with Dark Eyes. The festival saw most films screened at either the Odeon West End or at BFI Southbank. During her period as director, Whitaker continued to expand the festival. By the end of her tenure as director in 1996, the festival had grown to include screenings of over 200 films from around the world, more venues had been added and more tickets were sold to non-BFI members. She also began the festival's practice of including newly restored films from the National Film Archive and overseas institutions. The 1991 festival was held between 6–21 November, opening with the world premiere of Mike Newell's Enchanted April and closing with Mark Peploe's Afraid of the Dark. Due to classification issues, special permission was needed from Westminster City Council to screen Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers in 1994 and David Cronenberg's Crash in 1996. The 1996 festival had opened with The First Wives Club and also featured Shane Meadows' debut film Small Time. =1997–2011= Adrian Wooton was appointed festival director and Sandra Hebron as festival programmer in 1997. The 2002 festival was heled 6-21 November. Hebron became artistic director of the festival in 2003, replacing Wooton. The same year, the festival's name was changed to the BFI London Film Festival. The 2004 festival ran from 20 October to 4 November, opening with the UK premiere of Mike Leigh's Vera Drake and closed with David O. Russell's I Heart Huckabees. The 2005 festival was held from 19 October to 3 November and had 180 features, opening with Fernando Meirelles' The Constant Gardener and closing with the UK premiere of George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck. 161 of the 180 screenings were sold out. The fiftieth edition of the festival opened with the European premiere of Kevin McDonald's The Last King of Scotland. It also featured the European premieres of Todd Field's Little Children and Anthony Minghella's Breaking and Entering. It closed with Babel. The world premiere of Frost/Nixon on 15 October 2008 was the opening night gala of the 2008 festival and Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire was the closing film. Previously a number of festival awards were presented at the Closing gala, but in 2009, with the aid of some funding from the UK Film Council, a stand-alone awards ceremony was introduced. The UK Film Council helped fund the festival for three years until it was abolished in 2011. In 2009 the festival, whilst focused around Leicester Square (Vue West End, Odeon West End and Empire) and the BFI Southbank in central London, also screened films across 18 other venues – Curzon Mayfair Cinema, ICA Cinema on The Mall, The Ritzy in Brixton, Cine Lumière in South Kensington, Queen Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank, David Lean Cinema in Croydon, the Genesis Cinema in Whitechapel, The Greenwich Picturehouse, the Phoenix Cinema in East Finchley, Rich Mix in Old Street, the Rio Cinema in Dalston, the Tricycle Cinema in Kilburn, the Waterman Art Centre in Brentford and Trafalgar Square for the open air screening of short films from the BFI National Archive. The 2009 Festival featured 15 world premieres including Wes Anderson’s first animated feature, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Sam Taylor-Wood’s feature début Nowhere Boy, about the formative years of John Lennon, as well as the Festival's first ever Archive Gala, the BFI's new restoration of Anthony Asquith’s Underground, with live music accompaniment by the Prima Vista Social Club. European premieres in 2009 included Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Micmacs, Scott Hicks’ The Boys Are Back and Robert Connolly's Balibo, as well as Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni's The Well and Lucy Bailey and Andrew Thompson's Mugabe and the White African. In 2009, directors travelling to London to introduce their latest work included Michael Haneke (Cannes Palme d'Or winner, The White Ribbon), Atom Egoyan (Chloe), Steven Soderbergh (The Informant!), Lone Scherfig (An Education), Ang Lee (Taking Woodstock), Jane Campion (Bright Star), Gaspar Noé (Enter The Void), Lee Daniels (Precious), Grant Heslov (The Men Who Stare at Goats), and Jason Reitman (Up in the Air). In addition to Fantastic Mr. Fox and Up in the Air, George Clooney supported his role in The Men Who Stare at Goats. The Festival also welcomed back previous alumni such as John Hillcoat (The Road), Joe Swanberg (Alexander The Last) and Harmony Korine (Trash Humpers), whilst also screening films from Manoel de Oliveira (Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl), Jim Jarmusch (The Limits Of Control), Claire Denis (White Material), Ho-Yuhang (At The End Of Daybreak), Todd Solondz (Life During Wartime), and Joel and Ethan Coen (A Serious Man). American Express became the festival's principal sponsor in 2010. Previously it had been sponsored by The Times. The 2011 festival was held from 12–27 October opening with Mereille's 360 and closed with The Deep Blue Sea, both starring Rachel Weisz. =2012–2017= Clare Stewart was appointed as head of exhibition at the BFI in August 2011 replacing Hebron and was the festival's director from the 2012 edition. Under Stewart, a formal competition was organised in 2012, films were organized into strands such as \\"Love\\", \\"Debate\\", \\"Dare\\" and \\"Thrill\\" and films started to be screened outside of London. The 2012 festival ran from 10–21 October, opening with Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and closing with the European premiere of Mike Newell's Great Expectations. The 2013 festival was held between 9–20 October opening with Captain Phillips and closing with the world premiere of Saving Mr. Banks, both starring Tom Hanks. 248 films were screened in 2014 and the festival saw a record attendance of 163,000. It ran from 8–19 October, opening with the European premiere of The Imitation Game and closing with the European premiere of Fury. Simultaneous screenings of the opening and closing films took place around the UK. The Odeon West End, which accounted for 23% of admissions in 2014, closed 1 January 2015, so more screenings moved to the Vue West End as well as moving to the Cineworld Haymarket and Picturehouse Central. Festival attendances fell 4% for the 2015 edition, which ran from 7–18 October. The festival featured 14 world premieres and 40 European premieres, opening with Suffragette and closing with Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs. The 60th edition of the festival held between 5–16 October 2016 saw the opening of the temporary Embankment Garden Cinema, in Victoria Embankment Gardens. The festival opened with the European premiere of Amma Asante's A United Kingdom and closed with the European premiere of Ben Wheatley's Free Fire. In the first 60 years of the festival, it had shown 27 films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 19 by Satyajit Ray and 18 by Jean-Luc Godard. The 2017 edition was held between 4–15 October. It opened with Andy Serkis' Breathe and closed with Martin McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. =BFI London Film Festival today= While the programme still retains the 'festivals' feel, it also now shows new discoveries from \\"important and exciting talents\\" in world cinema. Whilst it continues to be first and foremost a public festival, it is also attended by large numbers of film professionals and journalists from all over the world. Importantly, it offers opportunities for people to see films that may not otherwise get a UK screening along with films which will get a release in the near future. Other than these events the screenings at the Festival are quite informal and similar to the normal cinema experience except for two things; some films are accompanied by Q&A; sessions which give the audience unique access to the film-maker and/or a member of the cast and offer insight into the making of the film and occasionally an opportunity for the audience to engage directly and ask questions; and the second aspect is that people generally stay and watch the credits. Stewart took a sabbatical for the 2018 edition of the festival and her deputy, Tricia Tuttle stood in as interim artistic director. She became artistic director in December 2018. Current film programmers include Kate Taylor (Senior Programmer), Michael Blyth and Laure Bonville. The 2018 festival was held from 10–21 October. It opened with the European premiere of Steve McQueen's Widows. It saw the first film at the festival to premiere outside London with the UK premiere of Mike Leigh's Peterloo being held at HOME in Manchester on 17 October as well as the world premiere of Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old, which was also screened simultaneously around the UK. It closed with the world premiere of Stan & Ollie. The 2019 edition ran from 2–13 October and opened with Armando Iannucci's The Personal History of David Copperfield which was shown at the Odeon Leicester Square and at the Embankment Garden Cinema. It closed with Martin Scorsese's The Irishman. The 2020 festival will be held between 7-18 October, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the festival will feature up to 50 online films with only 12 films being shown in London and around the United Kingdom. The festival will open with the European premiere of Steve McQueen's Mangrove and close with Ammonite, directed by Francis Lee. Surprise film Derek Malcolm introduced a screening of an unannounced film during the festival each year. Surprise films have included A Chorus Line (1985), The Color of Money (1986), Sideways (2004), Capitalism: A Love Story (2009), Silver Linings Playbook (2012), The Grandmaster (2013), Birdman (2014), Anomalisa (2015), Sully (2016), Lady Bird (2017), Green Book (2018) and Uncut Gems (2019). For the 50th anniversary of the festival, rather than one surprise film, there were 50 screenings of a surprise film around London. Awards The categories highlight both emerging and established talent. *The Sutherland Trophy – for the most original and innovative first feature in the London Film Festival. Named after the BFI's patron, The 5th Duke of Sutherland, this award boasts recipients as noteworthy as Bertolucci, Fassbinder, Godard and Antonioni. *The Grierson Award – for the best feature- length documentary in the festival. This award is given jointly by the LFF and the Grierson Trust which commemorates the pioneering Scottish documentary- maker John Grierson (1898–1972), famous for Drifters and Night Mail. The Grierson Trust has a long-standing tradition of recognising outstanding films that demonstrate integrity, originality and technical excellence and social or cultural significance. From 2009, a new standalone awards ceremony was launched which included the following awards: *Best Film – celebrates creative, original, imaginative, intelligent and distinctive film-making. *Best British Newcomer Award – celebrates new and emerging British film talent and recognises the achievements of a new writer, producer or director who demonstrates real creative flair and imagination with their first feature. *BFI Fellowships – the Festival showcases both the work of new film-makers and established ones, and presenting two Fellowships provides a fitting contrast to those Awards recognising new talent. =2004= ;The Sutherland Trophy :Tarnation, dir.

The winning film- makers all said they hoped that culture could help to restore peace to their countries. =2015= At a London Film Festival declared by its director Clare Stewart to be promoting strong women in the industry, both in front of and behind the camera, the theme continued into the awards, with the Best Film being named as the Greek comedy Chevalier, directed by Athina Rachel Tsangari. The winner of the Sutherland Award for Best First Feature, The Witch, was described by the jury as \\"a fresh, feminist take on a timeless tale.\\" Another woman was honoured with the Grierson Award for the best documentary; the Australian film-maker Jennifer Peedom, who was shooting Sherpa as a devastating avalanche struck the Himalayas, in April 2014. And the Oscar- winning Cate Blanchett described how she was \\"deeply honoured and dumbstruck\\" at being awarded a BFI Fellowship. =2016= Following the previous year's festival aimed to celebrate strong women in the film industry, 2016 was partly designed to better reflect the diverse audiences in society; the festival opened with a film directed by a black director and the BFI Fellowship was awarded to Steve McQueen. Most of the awards, once again, had strong female themes – either being directed by women, about women or both. Kelly Reichardt’s Certain Women won the Official Competition, while Raw, by the French director Julia Ducournau, won the Sutherland Award for the Best First Feature. Noting that there are still too few opportunities for female directors, Ducournau said, \\"It's about time that things are starting to change. It's good that doors are now being opened.\\" The Grierson Award for the best documentary went to Starless Dreams, filmed inside a rehabilitation centre for juvenile delinquent women in Iran. For the first time, the London Film Festival ran a competition for the best short film. This went to Issa Touma, Thomas Vroege and Floor van de Muelen for the documentary 9 Days – From My Window in Aleppo. Touma, a Syrian photographer who regularly returns to Aleppo, said it was important for intellectuals, academics and artists not to desert the country. \\"You can't change anything from far away,\\" he said. =2017= Accepting the prestigious BFI Fellowship at the 2017 London Film Festival Awards, director Paul Greengrass acknowledged that it had been a difficult week for the film industry, on the day that Harvey Weinstein was expelled from the Academy that hands out the Oscars. He said the industry had to act and words weren't enough. The Best Film on the night went to Russia's Loveless, making Andrey Zvyagintsev the second director to have won the honour twice. South Africa's John Trengove won the Best First Film award for The Wound. Lucy Cohen's Kingdom of Us, about the aftermath of a suicide, was named the Best Documentary. And Patrick Bresnan's The Rabbit Hunt won the third Best Short Film prize. =2018= ;Best Film :Joy, dir. Sudabeh Mortezai :(Special mention: Birds of Passage, dir.

Olaf was also one of three simultaneous cyclones to form during the 2004–05 season, forming 21 hours after Cyclone Nancy formed to the east. A powerful Category 5 cyclone, Olaf stuck American Samoa causing heavy damage although exact estimates are unknown. Despite the damage, there were no reported deaths or injuries from the cyclone. Olaf was third South Pacific cyclone to hit the Cook Islands during the 2004–05 season (the other two being Meena and Nancy), and Cyclone Percy would later affect the already devastated archipelago less than 2 weeks later. Meteorological history The origins of Olaf were from a broad area of low pressure, that had developed between the island nation of Tuvalu and the Samoan Islands by February 10. This area of low pressure, subsequently spawned two tropical disturbances during February 10. The first disturbance: 09F was located, to the north-northeast of Samoa and later developed into Severe Tropical Cyclone Nancy. The second was designated as Tropical Disturbance 08F by the Fiji Meteorological Service, while it was located about to the northeast of Fiji. A tropical wave formed on February 10. The tropical wave, then spawned two areas of low pressure, one of which became Tropical Depression 08F. At 1300 UTC, the tropical depression was located 490 miles north west of Apia. By 1500, the depression organized into a tropical storm with 40 mph wind and was named Olaf. At the time of formation, the tropical storm was nearly stationary. The low wind shear and warm water temperatures allowed Olaf to undergo rapid intensification. In a 12‑hour period, Olaf quickly became a Category 1 cyclone with 80 mph (130 km/h) winds in a 10-minute average speed. On February 15, the barometric pressure fell to 930 mbar as Olaf reached Category 4 status. After reaching Category 4 status, Olaf then moved on a south-southeasterly course at 7 mph (11 km/h).Olaf Report Cyclone Olaf then tuned east and moving 100 miles (165 km) east of Western Samoa. On February 16, satellite imagery depicted a well-defined eye as Olaf strengthened into a Category 5 cyclone. Olaf reached a peak intensity of 165 mph with a barometric pressure of 915 millibars. It is possible Olaf could have a lower pressure but official track reports have Olaf at 915 mbar. At the time of peak intensity, the center of the storm was only 70 miles (120 km) northeast of American Samoa and 90 miles (145 km) northwest of Pago Pago. At the same time, Cyclone Olaf underwent a minor Fujiwhara effect with Cyclone Nancy before resuming its southeasterly course. Moving at 10 mph (16 km/h), the cyclone maintained Category 5 status as the eye passed 15 miles east of Ta'u, American Samoa. During that time, a weather station reported a 931 barometric pressure reading. On February 18, an approaching upper level trough to the south, and strong wind shear caused Olaf to weaken as the storm rapidly moved southeastward. As Olaf moved into the New Zealand area of responsibility, the main circulation separated from the center and Olaf quickly became extratropical 18 hours later. The extratropical remnants of Olaf, quickly re-intensified into a powerful extratropical storm on February 23. The extratropical storm persisted for two days before dissipating near Pitcairn Island Preparations Tropical Cyclones Nancy (right) and Olaf (left) on February 14 Forecasts predicted Olaf to move near and over Samoa and American Samoa in 24–48 hours and hitting the southern Cook Islands as a Category 4 cyclone.AFAP Warning 1 In American Samoa, schools and businesses were closed and warnings were broadcasting over television and radio. Forecasters predicted that Olaf will bring storm surge and inland flooding and strong winds. In Niue, the cyclone was carefully monitored by forecasters, fearing a repeat of the destruction wrought by Cyclone Heta a year ago. French Polynesia was also under a cyclone warning. Forecasters further issued Watches and warnings for the rest of the Cook Islands.AFAP Warning 2 The next day, Olaf diverted course forcing authorities to order evacuations. In Tutuila, 70 emergency shelters were opened and 1,000 people evacuated low-lying areas. The approach of the cyclone, shut down the local airport, cancelling numerous flights. In Tau, most of the residences evacuated to storm shelters built on higher ground. The evaluation in the Manu'a group islands, totaled up to 2,000.AFAP Warning 3 Impact A destructive cyclone, Olaf caused severe damage in both Samoa and American Samoa. Because of well executed warnings and evacuations, there were no deaths. However, 2 people were reported missing and assumed dead, when their boat sank during the storm. =Samoa and Australian Samoa= Landslide damage from Olaf. Although the eye of Olaf never made landfall, several weather stations reported sustained winds of 75–125 mph (120–200 km/h). The winds damaged powerlines and closed an airport. Olaf also produced storm surge damage along the coast. Offshore, fishing fleet was caught off guard by the storm. One of the boats, sank 150 miles (240 km) off the coast of Samoa, however the crew was rescued.Cyclone Olaf slams Samoa 21 other fishermen were also rescued. Olaf then brushed past the American Samoa, bringing 125 mph (200 km/h) winds. Because of Olaf strength, there was severe damage across American Samoa. In the Manua Islands, the storm destroyed several seaside homes, ruined crops and left thousands without power. In Tau, 80–90 percent of the infrastructure was destroyed by the storm. Offshore, three people were rescued after their boat sank near Pago Pago.nbcnews.com =Cook Islands= Olaf then struck the Cook Islands which were already reeling form the impact of Cyclones Meena and Nancy earlier. In Rarotonga, Olaf skirted the western side of the island. That placed the island in the strongest part of the storm, which resulted in extensive damage to homes and businesses. According to press reports, nearly 30–40 percent of the population was left without electricity and 60% of the structures sustained damage. Aftermath Olaf damaged several water stations in the Manua Islands causing a water shortage. Because of the damage, President George W. Bush declared those islands disaster areas. The declaration allowed residents and local governments in the American Samoa to receive federal aid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided much aid to the residents of the American Samoa.FEMA Disaster Declaration The Initial Response Resources were sent to the American Samoa and its surrounding islands and was distributed by the United States Coast Guard and the government of the American Samoa on February 21, 2005.DOI report on the Olaf Despite the devastation in the Manua Islands, it could have been worse if Olaf hit American Samoa directly. In the Cook Islands, the Australian and New Zealand governments provided over A$30,000 (2005) in relief assistance.Cyclone Olaf Update February 28, 2005 On February 22, 2005, the Government of New Zealand, provided materials and workmen to help with the cleanup effort. The French government and the United Nations also assisted in the relief effort by sending soldiers from Tahiti and providing more aid to the stricken residents.

The yellow crescent corresponds to σ, whereas the red tube corresponds to τ and the blue plane corresponds to z=1. The three surfaces intersect at the point P (shown as a black sphere). Bipolar cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional bipolar coordinate system in the perpendicular z-direction. The two lines of foci F_{1} and F_{2} of the projected Apollonian circles are generally taken to be defined by x=-a and x=+a, respectively, (and by y=0) in the Cartesian coordinate system. The term \\"bipolar\\" is often used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses, hyperbolas, and Cassini ovals. However, the term bipolar coordinates is never used to describe coordinates associated with those curves, e.g., elliptic coordinates. Basic definition The most common definition of bipolar cylindrical coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, z) is : x = a \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sinh \\\\tau}{\\\\cosh \\\\tau - \\\\cos \\\\sigma} : y = a \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\sigma}{\\\\cosh \\\\tau - \\\\cos \\\\sigma} : z = \\\\ z where the \\\\sigma coordinate of a point P equals the angle F_{1} P F_{2} and the \\\\tau coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances d_{1} and d_{2} to the focal lines : \\\\tau = \\\\ln \\\\frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}} (Recall that the focal lines F_{1} and F_{2} are located at x=-a and x=+a, respectively.) Surfaces of constant \\\\sigma correspond to cylinders of different radii : x^{2} + \\\\left( y - a \\\\cot \\\\sigma \\\\right)^{2} = \\\\frac{a^{2}}{\\\\sin^{2} \\\\sigma} that all pass through the focal lines and are not concentric. The surfaces of constant \\\\tau are non-intersecting cylinders of different radii : y^{2} + \\\\left( x - a \\\\coth \\\\tau \\\\right)^{2} = \\\\frac{a^{2}}{\\\\sinh^{2} \\\\tau} that surround the focal lines but again are not concentric. The focal lines and all these cylinders are parallel to the z-axis (the direction of projection). In the z=0 plane, the centers of the constant-\\\\sigma and constant-\\\\tau cylinders lie on the y and x axes, respectively. Scale factors The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates \\\\sigma and \\\\tau are equal : h_{\\\\sigma} = h_{\\\\tau} = \\\\frac{a}{\\\\cosh \\\\tau - \\\\cos\\\\sigma} whereas the remaining scale factor h_{z}=1. Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals : dV = \\\\frac{a^{2}}{\\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\tau - \\\\cos\\\\sigma \\\\right)^{2}} d\\\\sigma d\\\\tau dz and the Laplacian is given by : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2}} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\tau - \\\\cos\\\\sigma \\\\right)^{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\tau^{2}} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z^{2}} Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. Applications The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations, e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation, for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables (in 2D).

Prior to 1992, Kazakhstan had a emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics. Overview The emblem is an image of shanyrak (, Shańyraq; more often seen in the Russian transcription, Шанырак, shanyrak), the upper dome-like portion of a yurt, against a sky blue background which irradiates (in the form of sun rays) uyks (supports) set off by wings of mythical horses, inspired by Tulpar which represent bravery. The circle shape of the Emblem is a symbol of a life and eternity. The shanyrak symbolizes well-being of family, peace and calmness. A design very similar to the Kazakh shanyraq is used in the flag of neighboring Kyrgyzstan; it is known as tunduk in Kyrgyz. The colour version of the national emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan consists of two colours: gold and sky blue. The golden colour corresponds to a light, clear future of Kazakh people, and the blue sky colour is a symbol of aspiration to the peace, consent, friendship and unity with all people.Official site of the President of Kazakhstan - National emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan The name of the country in Kazakh, QAZAQSTAN, is in the lower part of the emblem.

The yellow sheet is the prism of a half-hyperbola corresponding to ν=-45°, whereas the red tube is an elliptical prism corresponding to μ=1. The blue sheet corresponds to z=1. The three surfaces intersect at the point P (shown as a black sphere) with Cartesian coordinates roughly (2.182, -1.661, 1.0). The foci of the ellipse and hyperbola lie at x = ±2.0. Elliptic cylindrical coordinates are a three- dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two- dimensional elliptic coordinate system in the perpendicular z-direction. Hence, the coordinate surfaces are prisms of confocal ellipses and hyperbolae. The two foci F_{1} and F_{2} are generally taken to be fixed at -a and +a, respectively, on the x-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. Basic definition The most common definition of elliptic cylindrical coordinates (\\\\mu, u, z) is : x = a \\\\ \\\\cosh \\\\mu \\\\ \\\\cos u : y = a \\\\ \\\\sinh \\\\mu \\\\ \\\\sin u : z = z where \\\\mu is a nonnegative real number and u \\\\in [0, 2\\\\pi]. These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae. The trigonometric identity : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\mu} + \\\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu} = \\\\cos^{2} u + \\\\sin^{2} u = 1 shows that curves of constant \\\\mu form ellipses, whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\cos^{2} u} - \\\\frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sin^{2} u} = \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\mu - \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu = 1 shows that curves of constant u form hyperbolae. Scale factors The scale factors for the elliptic cylindrical coordinates \\\\mu and u are equal : h_{\\\\mu} = h_{ u} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u} whereas the remaining scale factor h_{z}=1. Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals : dV = a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u \\\\right) d\\\\mu d u dz and the Laplacian equals : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u \\\\right)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\mu^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial u^{2}} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z^{2}} Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\mu, u, z) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. Alternative definition An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, z) are sometimes used, where \\\\sigma = \\\\cosh \\\\mu and \\\\tau = \\\\cos u. Hence, the curves of constant \\\\sigma are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant \\\\tau are hyperbolae. The coordinate \\\\tau must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the \\\\sigma coordinate must be greater than or equal to one. The coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, z) have a simple relation to the distances to the foci F_{1} and F_{2}. For any point in the (x,y) plane, the sum d_{1}+d_{2} of its distances to the foci equals 2a\\\\sigma, whereas their difference d_{1}-d_{2} equals 2a\\\\tau. Thus, the distance to F_{1} is a(\\\\sigma+\\\\tau), whereas the distance to F_{2} is a(\\\\sigma-\\\\tau). (Recall that F_{1} and F_{2} are located at x=-a and x=+a, respectively.) A drawback of these coordinates is that they do not have a 1-to-1 transformation to the Cartesian coordinates : x = a\\\\sigma\\\\tau : y^{2} = a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right) Alternative scale factors The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, z) are : h_{\\\\sigma} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2}}{\\\\sigma^{2} - 1}} : h_{\\\\tau} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2}}{1 - \\\\tau^{2}}} and, of course, h_{z}=1. Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes : dV = a^{2} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right)}} d\\\\sigma d\\\\tau dz and the Laplacian equals : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right) } \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^{2} - 1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^{2} - 1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} \\\\right) + \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tau^{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tau^{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\right) \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z^{2}} Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. Applications The classic applications of elliptic cylindrical coordinates are in solving partial differential equations, e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation, for which elliptic cylindrical coordinates allow a separation of variables. A typical example would be the electric field surrounding a flat conducting plate of width 2a. The three-dimensional wave equation, when expressed in elliptic cylindrical coordinates, may be solved by separation of variables, leading to the Mathieu differential equations. The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful. A typical example might involve an integration over all pairs of vectors \\\\mathbf{p} and \\\\mathbf{q} that sum to a fixed vector \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\mathbf{q}, where the integrand was a function of the vector lengths \\\\left \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\right and \\\\left \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\right. (In such a case, one would position \\\\mathbf{r} between the two foci and aligned with the x-axis, i.e., \\\\mathbf{r} = 2a \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}.) For concreteness, \\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\mathbf{p} and \\\\mathbf{q} could represent the momenta of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).

It was written and produced by Björk, with additional writing by Sjón and production by Mark Bell. The song was written by the singer specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, after a request by the International Olympic Committee. \\"Oceania\\" was released as a promotional single on 13 August 2004, by One Little Indian Records. The song was written at the ocean's point of view, from which the singer believes all life emerged, and details the human's evolution, whilst accompanied by a choir. \\"Oceania\\" was generally well received by music critics, who believed it was the best track from Medúlla, although some thought it was not the best choice for a promotional release. The accompanying music video for the song, directed by Lynn Fox, features Björk as \\"Mother Oceania\\", whilst being jewel-encrusted in dark watery depths, with a colourful sunset and swirling floral creatures above her. A remix of the song, featuring additional lyrics and vocals by Kelis on her point of view of the continents, was featured as a B-side to the \\"Who Is It\\" single. A piano version also appeared on the DVD single, and was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. The song was premiered during Björk's performance on the Summer Olympics ceremony, and was later included on the setlist of the Volta Tour (2007–08). At the 47th Grammy Awards in 2005, it was nominated in the category of Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Cover versions of \\"Oceania\\" were done six times, while it was sampled once. Background and composition The International Olympic Committee commissioned a song by Björk specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The singer revealed that the committee asked her to do a kind of \\"Ebony and Ivory\\" or \\"We Are the World\\" type of song, which are \\"smashing tunes\\" according to her, but she thought, \\"'Maybe there's another angle to this'. When I tried to write an Olympic lyric, though, it was full of sports socks and ribbons. I ended up pissing myself laughing\\". Then, she called Sjón, an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as \\"Bachelorette\\" from her fourth studio album Homogenic (1997). When she said to him that they would need something \\"suitably epic\\" for the Olympics, the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University. \\"Oceania\\" was the last song recorded for Medúlla. Björk said about the song: \\"I am incredibly honoured to have been asked to write a song and sing it at the Olympics. The song is written from the point of view of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution. It sees no borders, different races or religion which has always been at the core of these [games]\\". During an interview with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on \\"Oceania\\" was kept being delayed because she wanted to do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed \\"sirenes\\", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as \\"the new bright hope of the hip hop scene\\". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, \\"That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing.\\" The song was written at the ocean's point of view, detailing the human's evolution. According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine, it calls listeners' attention to \\"Mother Oceania\\" from which the singer believes all life emerged, whilst she sings: \\"You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / And crawled ashore […]\\". The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, \\"jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire cadence of Rahzel's beatbox\\", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, \\"Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why\\", is about how \\"we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land\\", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as \\"frank sensuality\\". \\"Oceania\\" also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that \\"the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [suggests] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins. Here she imagines herself as the sea itself, proud of all the belegged creatures she's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years. It's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune\\". Remixes A remix version of \\"Oceania\\" featuring additional lyrics and vocals by American singer Kelis was recorded. She explained they were set to perform on Fashion Rocks concert in London the previous year, and their dressing rooms were right next to each other. Björk had an album by Canadian singer Peaches that was skipping, then Kelis gave her the copy of the album she had. They started talking and eventually hung out and exchanged numbers after the show, and later Björk contacted Kelis to work together, which she agreed. Then, Kelis recorded her vocals at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and wrote her own words in the song, from the point of view of the continents. Originally not intended to be commercially released, the remix leaked after being played on BBC Radio 1's The Breezeblock, but was then included on the \\"Who Is It\\" single as a B-side. According to The Guardian, \\"it's a brilliant fusing together of two distinct voices, Kelis handling the breathy first verse, as layers of her chopped-up vocals form the rhythm track, while Björk at first comes across as restrained, allowing Kelis' ad-libs to soar before unleashing a song-stopping, wordless roar that heralds the song's dramatic final coda\\". A piano version also appeared on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, \\"When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, and it was as complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days figuring out how to make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios\\". Björk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last- minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of \\"Oceania\\" was the last track to be worked for Medúlla. Critical reception \\"Oceania\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News called the song \\"one of those polarizing songs, with its Ethel Merman-like synchronized vocal sweeps that do suggest the aquatic, in a 1950s sort of way\\". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman labeled the track as a \\"strikingly beautiful\\" song. Alex Ross, reporter writing for The New Yorker stated that with \\"Oceania\\", Björk \\"confirmed her status as the ultimate musical cosmopolitan\\", acquainted with Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Wu-Tang Clan. Matthew Gasteier from Prefix magazine called the track \\"the best song on the album\\", whilst complimenting \\"its swooping chorus [which] recalls the migration of birds or the time-elapsed drifting of icebergs, a swirl of beauty and power crashing down onto and then rising above the mix. It culminates in the near screech that leads into the sexy-spooky coda\\". According to Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club, in a positive review, \\"the electronic flourish strays from her organic vocal focus, but Björk summons the same kind of tingle with choral language\\" in the song, \\"which finds The London Choir reacting to what sounds like a thrilling slow-motion circus act\\". \\"Oceania\\" was \\"spoilt by some overenthusiastic vocal whoopings\\", according to David Hooper from BBC Music. The Guardians writer David Peschek said that when the singer sings in the song, \\"choral swoops [explodes] like fireworks behind her\\". AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the song, along with Medúllas lead single \\"Who Is It\\", \\"have an alien quality that is all the stranger considering that nearly all of their source material is human (except for the odd keyboard or two)\\". Dominique Leone of Pitchfork thought \\"Oceania\\" was hardly the most obvious choice for a promotional single release, despite its \\"bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples\\". Jeremy D. Larson from Time magazine provided a mixed review to the song, stating that it was the best Olympic theme song, but during the Olympics performance, \\"when she sang 'Every pearl is a lynx is a girl' we think you could hear the world collectively sigh, 'Where's Celine Dion?'\\". In 2005, the song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards but lost out to Norah Jones' \\"Sunrise\\". Music video Björk as \\"Mother Oceania\\" in the music video, wearing tiny crystal beads on her face The accompanying music video for \\"Oceania\\" was directed by Lynn Fox, and was premiered on August 13, 2004 through Björk's official site. According to Lynn Fox, Björk gave the team the initial sketch of the track in January 2004. Whilst they were doing scribbles for it, they had several phone conversations with the singer and emailed her images to keep her up to date with the progress of the work. For \\"Oceania\\", initial animations took six weeks, then had couple of days preparing for the shoot in Iceland and a few more days after to put all the shots together. Björk's make-up took eight hours to be done and included a hand-collage of tiny crystal gems on her face. Post- production team The Mill was then hired to emphasise the glints that beam from them. Initially, a Flame spark was used to select and highlight glints automatically but the results proved \\"too random\\". For a more \\"organic\\" look, The Mill's Paul Marangos spent two days in Flame inputting glints by hand, using live action glints as reference. The Mill's Adam Scott further enhanced the video with an initial live action grade and final DCP. The video was finished just a day before the opening ceremony, leaving a small amount to get the video distributed to TV stations. BEAM.TV distributed the video instantly via its network of international post-production partners. Like in the song, in the music video Björk is depicted as \\"Mother Oceania\\". The video opens with the surface of a body of water appearing yellowish and bright. Camera pans down to darker, deeper waters. Björk appears out of the dark background, singing and covered with sparkling jewels. As the second verse begins, images of jellyfish, representing the continents (her children) are thrown from Björk's hands. During the third verse they swim around and away from their mother, carried by the currents, which move in time with the song. In the bridge section, new sea flowers, with brilliant colors, emerge from the background, in contrast to the muted and darker colors of previous scenes. As the fifth verse continues, the camera pans back up to the much lighter surface, not seen since the beginning of the video. All sorts of marine life are swimming about the surface. Shortly after the sixth verse begins, Bjork is shown in deep, dark water. Several seconds later, the lighter surface of the water is shown without her. When she begins to sing \\"Your sweat is salty\\", a somewhat rapid alternation of images ensues: the light surface is shown for one second, followed by Björk singing in the deep water; these scenes alternate until she stops singing during the coda. Björk's vocal repetition ceases at the same time the visual alternation stops. The surface scene recedes, and Björk in the deep water comes to the fore, slowing. At the end of the video, she stands and smiles. Live performances At the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, where Björk premiered the song, she wore a very large dress which unfolded during her performance of \\"Oceania\\" to eventually occupy the entire stadium, and showed a map of the world in sign of union. Additionally, Björk wore \\"bluish-purple glittery eye shadow across her lids. Her dark hair dangled in tiny twists that framed her pixieish, freckled face\\". Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony, the song was downloaded more than 11,000 times on the iTunes Store. Jake Coyle from Today commented that her dress was \\"reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001\\". According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time, if it weren't for the fireworks at the end of the song, he was legitimately unsure if people in the audience would have cheered. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: \\"They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyoncé-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance\\". \\"Oceania\\" was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007–08). Samples and covers The song was sampled by E-40 in the track \\"Spend the Night\\" featuring Laroo, The DB'z, Droop-E and B-Slimm on his 2010 Revenue Retrievin': Night Shift album. SPIRITWO and singer Yael Claire covered \\"Oceania\\" with a Middle Eastern theme for the 2012 London Olympic games. Aspirant singer Srbuhi Hovhannisyan also covered the song on The Voice of Armenia in 2014. \\"Oceania\\" covers also appear on the albums by Beliss, Harmen Fraanje Quintet, Murphy's Law and Serena Fortebraccio.

His children continued to wield great influence until the American Revolution. Early life Stephen DeLancy was born in Caen, France, on October 24, 1663Kenneth T. Jackson: The Encyclopedia of New York City: The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. P. 324. as Etienne de Lancy, the only son of Jacques de Lancy, Esq. and Marguerite Bertrand. His great-grandfather was Jacques de Lancy, a crown prosecutor, and his 2x-great grandfather was Charles de Lancy, 5th Viscount of Laval and Nouvion. =Ancestors= Coat of arms of the House of de LancyPicardy The de Lancy family were minor French nobility (Noblesse de France Royale) and, despite being of the Huguenot faith, served the French Crown as administrators and bureaucrats for over two hundred years. Dating back to the early 15th century, successive generations of the de Lancy family (or de Lanci in older texts) held the titles of Viscount of Laval and of Nouvion, Baron of Raray, Lord of Nery and of Faverolles, Verines, Ribecourt and Haramont. (Vicomte de Laval et de Nouvion, Baron de Raray, et Seigneur de Néry et de Faverolles, Vérines,http://charlesfevre.perso.sfr.fr/genealogie/page_nery.htm Ribécourt, et Haramont) The family coat of arms is blazoned: Or an Eagle Sable displayed beaked and membered Gules, overall an escutcheon Azure in pale three spears erect Or. (Armes : d'or à l'aigle de sable becqué et membré de gueules chargé en coeur d'un écusson d'azur surchargé de trois lances d'or posées en pal.) Jacques De Lancy, was descended from Guy de Lancy (d. 1436), the 1st Viscount of Laval and of Nouvion, which was created in 1432 during the reign of Henry VI. Guy was succeeded in 1436 by his son, Jean de Lancy, 2nd Viscount. He was succeeded by his son, Jean de Lancy, 3rd Viscount (b. 1470), who was succeeded by his son, Charles de Lancy, 4th Viscount in 1525. Ten years later, in 1535, Charles was succeeded by Charles de Lancy, 5th Viscount of Laval, who was the eldest of his two sons from his second marriage to Marie de Villiers.The 4th Viscount's second son was Christophe de Lancy, Lord of Raray. On April 15, 1534, Charles, the 5th Viscount, married Isabeau Branche, daughter of Fourcy Branche, Lord of Bréau, with whom he had three sons: Charles de Lancy, Jacques de Lancy, and Claude de Lancy. The second son, Jacques, crown prosecutor in the provost, had a son Pierre de Lancy, Lord of Niville. His son, Jacques de Lancy, was Étienne de Lancy's father. Around 1600, the land of Raray was sold to Nicolas de Lancy, advisor to the King, war treasurer, Chamberlain of Gaston, Duke of Orléans. He built of the present castle of Raray along with the two outer buildings. In 1945, Raray Castle was the filming location for scenes from the film Beauty and the Beast by Jean Cocteau. In 1654, de Lacey was created Marquis de Néry-Raray by Louis XIV, a title which is currently held by the Marquis de la Bédoyère who married into the family. Fleeing from France In 1686, de Lancy was forced to flee bitter persecution by French Catholics following the October 18, 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV, in which some two hundred thousand Huguenots left their native land. Escaping first to Rotterdam with a portion of the family jewels which his mother had given him sewn into his clothing, de Lancy sailed to England, obtaining an \\"Act of Denization\\" (naturalization) from King James II on March 3, 1686. =Life in New York= Soon afterwards, de Lancy sailed for the English Colonies in America, landing in New York City on June 6, 1686. Almost exactly one month later (July 7), he obtained additional letters of denization in New York from Governor Dongan, and on September 9, 1687, took the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown under the Colonial Act of 1683. It was at this time that he anglicized his name, becoming Stephen Delancey. He sold his portion of the family jewels for 300 British Pounds and became a merchant. Delancey was to become one of the most successful merchants in the colony of New York with his well-known granary, warehouse and retail store, known to all as \\"Delancey and Co.\\" During Queen Anne's War, letters of marque against the French served as a cover for DeLancey to engage in trade as an interloper with Red Sea Pirates of Île Sainte-Marie. This also entailed his engagement in the trade in enslaved Malagasy people. By the 1730s, he had become such a prosperous merchant that he was able to build a large mansion on Broadway, just above Trinity Church. The mansion was eventually demolished in 1792 to build the City Hotel, and the site is now occupied by the United States Realty Building.Archaeological Documentary Study Thames Street Pedestrian Plaza Thames Street between Broadway and Trinity Place, p. iii. Prepared by Historical Perspectives, Inc., June 2017. Stephen Delancey played an active role in the life of the city, serving as an Alderman for several years, and both a member of the New York Provincial Assembly and the Governor's Council. He is also credited with having presented as gifts to the city its first Town Clock and its first Fire Engine. Family Stephen Delancey and his wife, Anne van Cortlandt 54 Pearl Street On January 23, 1700, Delancey married Anne van Cortlandt (1676-1724), third child of Gertrude Schuyler (b. 1654) and Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643–1700), the Chief Justice of the Province of New York. They had ten children, only five of whom survived infancy, all of whom married and had issue. They were: * James DeLancey (1703–1760), who married Anne Heathcote, the daughter of Caleb Heathcote, and who became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for the Province of New York, in addition to serving as Lt. Gov. of New York. * Peter DeLancey (1705–1770), who married Elizabeth Colden and became a merchant in what is now the Bronx, and served in the New York Provincial Assembly for many years. * Susannah DeLancey (1707–1771), who married Admiral Sir Peter Warren (1703–1752), who was an MP for Westminster.Gwyn, J.

In the summer of 1700, Delancey began construction of a house at 54 Pearl Street in New York City, on land given to his wife by her father as a wedding gift to the young couple. In 1762, the house was sold at auction by Stephen's heirs to Samuel Fraunces, who converted it into the Queen Charlotte Tavern. The house still stands today, and is known as Fraunces Tavern. At the time of his death on November 18, 1741, de Lancey left an estate valued in excess of £100,000 British Pounds (approximately $18,000,000 in US dollars today). =Descendants= Through his eldest surviving son James, he was the grandfather of James De Lancey (1732–1800), a colonial politician and turfman, and Anna De Lancey (1746–1817), who married a Recorder of New York City, Thomas Jones. Through his son Peter, he was the grandfather of Susan DeLancey (1754–1837), who married Thomas Henry Barclay, a lawyer who became one of the United Empire Loyalists in Nova Scotia and served in the colony's government. His other granddaughter Jane (1750-1809) married John Watts, her first cousin. The sisters married in a double-wedding ceremony. Through his son Oliver, he was the grandfather of Stephen Delancey (1748–1798), who served as Chief Justice of the Bahamas and Governor of Tobago and was the progenitor of the Bahamian branch of the De Lancy family; Oliver De Lancey (–1822), a British Army officer who served as a Member of Parliament for Maidstone from 1796 to 1802; and Susanna De Lancey who married Sir William Draper, a British military officer who conquered Manila in 1762.Pitt's 'Gallant Conqueror': The Turbulent Life of Lieutenant-General Sir William Draper, James Dreaper, 2006, Through his daughter Anne, he was the grandfather of John Watts (1749–1836), a lawyer and politician from New York City who represented New York in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Fox, Kiefer Sutherland, Phoebe Cates, Dianne Wiest and Jason Robards, and based on the novel by Jay McInerney, who also wrote the screenplay. It was the last film directed by Bridges, who died in 1993. Plot The film follows one week in the life of 24-year-old Jamie Conway. Originally from Pennsylvania, Jamie works as a fact-checker for a major New York magazine, but because of his nights partying with his glib best friend Tad and his addiction to cocaine which has led to him being frequently late to work and not finishing assignments on time; Jamie's on the verge of getting fired by his stern boss, Clara Tillinghast. His wife Amanda, a fast- rising model, just left him; he is also still reeling from the death of his mother from cancer a year earlier; and he follows a tabloid story about a pregnant woman in a coma. Jamie's story captures some of the glossy chaos and decadence of New York nightlife during the 1980s, and also views desperately trying to escape the pain in his life. After Jamie gets fired from his job, he goes on a further downward spiral with more substance and alcohol abuse. He attempts to go on a date with Tad's cousin Vicky as a favor so Tad could, in turn, have a fling with a woman he claims is a Penthouse Pet. Jamie also avoids phone calls from his younger brother Michael who has come to New York to look for him. Megan attempts to help Jamie out with finding a new job as well as try to open up about his troubled life and the reason why Amanda left him. After a confrontation with Michael and attending a party where Amanda is in attendance, Jamie finally decides to open up and come clean with himself before he ends up either dead or in jail. At the party, Tad is so intoxicated that he doesn't seem to realize that a woman he is flirting with is actually a man in drag. Meanwhile, Jamie phones Vicky and tells her that he and his brother Michael helped their dying mother commit suicide to end her suffering. Jamie then refuses Tad's offer to spend more time together and leaves the party. Jamie wanders the streets until dawn when he decides that today will be a better day to get his life back on track.

He felt that the book spoke to his generation and described it as \\"Graduate, with a little bit of Lost Weekend\\". The studio agreed to make the film with Jerry Weintraub producing and Joel Schumacher directing. McInerney wrote a draft of the screenplay and, soon afterward, Schumacher started rewriting it. Actor Emilio Estevez was interested in adapting it into a film. He met with McInerney while he was still working on the screenplay. Tom Cruise was offered first refusal on the script while McInerney and Schumacher were attempting to capture the novel's distinctive voice. McInerney, Cruise and Schumacher scouted locations in New York City and checked out the atmosphere of the club scenes described in the novel. At one point, Judd Nelson, Estevez, Zach Galligan, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Rob Lowe were all considered for the role of Allagash. In 1985, Weintraub took the property to United Artists when he became chief executive there. The film needed a new producer so Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg took over. They hired writer Julie Hickson to write a script. Cruise and Schumacher grew tired of waiting for a workable script, but before they could be replaced, Weintraub left United Artists. The project became entangled in a complicated settlement with the studio, months being lost before it finally stayed at United Artists. A decision was made to shoot the film in Toronto and cast an unknown in the leading role. Joyce Chopra was hired to co-write the script, with her husband Tom Cole, and also direct it. She had her agent send a copy of McInerney's novel to Michael J. Fox. The actor won the leading role and, at his request, the part of Tad Allagash went to Kiefer Sutherland. Fox's casting increased the budget to $15 million and principal photography was moved to New York City. The producers hired a crew, many of whom had worked with Pollack, while Chopra brought along the cinematographer from her first film, Smooth Talk, James Glennon. Fox had to be back in Los Angeles to start taping his TV series Family Ties by mid-July, giving Chopra only ten weeks to finish the film. It was rumored that she was indecisive, relying too much on consulting with Glennon and Cole, wasting time over a single shot. It was also rumored that she panicked while shooting on the streets of New York as fans of Fox disrupted filming. Chopra has said, \\"I kept insisting that we take time each day to give the actors a chance to find their way, in spite of the panic caused all around us by the morning calls from United Artists asking if I had taken my first shot yet. Working collaboratively with my cameraman seemed to drive the producers into a sort of frenzy\\". Studio executives did not like what Chopra was shooting and, a week into filming, the studio's chairman and its president of production flew from L.A. to New York to check on the film. Neither had read the script and both were unaware of how different it was from the novel. (Many female directors were being fired from films around this time.) McInerney has said that Cole wrote all the drugs out of the script while Cole said that he did this on instructions from Pollack, who was worried that the film would hurt Fox's wholesome image with audiences. Cole recalls, \\"There was definitely pressure and concern at that time about how Michael was seen by America.\\" The studio announced that \\"a more experienced director\\" was needed as a result of an impending strike by the Directors Guild of America. On the short list of possible replacements were Ulu Grosbard, Bruce Beresford, and James Bridges. Bridges received a call on a Friday that the film was in trouble, read the novel that night, and flew to New York on Sunday. He saw Chopra's footage and agreed to direct if he could start from scratch and hire Gordon Willis as his cinematographer. Reflecting on her experience in a 2013 interview with Hidden Films, Chopra reiterated Cole's statements that her version reduced the drug-related content because of studio pressures. \\"The film was produced right at the time of Nancy Reagan's 'Just Say No' [slogan] and I think the studios were scared shitless. I think the producers had a book they were sorry they were doing. Sydney said he didn't like the book, he didn't approve of it. So you get a mess, yeah.\\" She is still angered by statements made in The New York Times Magazine article. \\"What amazed me was, they were boasting that after I left, they were wearing a shirt with a shoe on it! They said that I spent a month doing nothing but filming Michael walking, which was so insane. I was flabbergasted that the producers would print a t-shirt to step on me. What kind of people are these?\\" According to Chopra, these \\"shoe leather\\" scenes were shot in adherence to the studio's schedule. \\"It was set up so that we would do all the exterior shots first. There was a concern about the trees. I don't remember what season it was, but if there were shots of Michael going from A to B, you try to do all his scenes on days with a lot of daylight.\\" In seven days, Bridges wrote a new draft bringing back the darker elements of the novel such as the main character's heavy drinking and drug abuse and replaced six actors, casting instead Jason Robards, John Houseman, Swoosie Kurtz, Frances Sternhagen, and Tracy Pollan, while keeping Sutherland and Dianne Wiest. The new cast members read the novel because there was no script at the time. Chopra had worked on the film for only a month, which Fox has described as \\"a rehearsal period, though it wasn't meant to be.\\" The strike forced the production to shoot in seven weeks and use McInerney's first draft, which Bridges liked the best. Bridges worked on the script on weekends with McInerney, who was enlisted to help with revisions. The two agreed to share screenwriting credit but the Writers Guild of America decided to give it to McInerney only. The cocaine that Fox snorts in the film was a prop called milk sugar. The filmmakers shot two different endings—one where Fox's character decides to start his life all over but is vague with what he specifically plans to do and an alternative one, to please the studio, where he has finished writing a novel to be called Bright Lights, Big City with a new girlfriend who is proud of what he has written. Reception Bright Lights, Big City was released on April 1, 1988 in 1,196 theaters, and grossed USD $5.1 million during its opening weekend. The film went to make $16.1 million domestically, well below its budget of $25 million. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has a 60% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews. In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, \\"Bright Lights isn't an embarrassment, like Less Than Zero; it's a smooth, professional job. But when it's over you may shrug your shoulders and ask, \\"Is that all?\\" Janet Maslin, wrote in her review for The New York Times, \\"Mr. Bridges may not have breathed fire into this material, but he has preserved most of its better qualities. He has treated it with intelligence, respect and no undue reverence, assembling a coherent film that resists any hint of exploitation\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson criticized Fox's performance, stating that he \\"was the wrong actor for the job. Fox, who in The Secret of My Succe$s showed a gift for light comedy, is too stylized a performer for the heavier stuff; he has no natural weight. In addition, Fox shows a reluctance to let the audience see him in an unflattering light\\". However, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: \\"Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)\\". Time magazine's Richard Schickel felt that the film, \\"arrives... looking like something that has been kicking around too long in the dead-letter office\\". =Home video= A special edition DVD version of Bright Lights, Big City was released on September 2, 2008. In her review for The Washington Post, Jen Chaney wrote, \\"In the end, that's what is most disappointing about this DVD. What could have become a compelling look at a seminal novel of the 1980s and its rocky path through Hollywood ends up being a rudimentary release with a couple of decent commentary tracks and two forgettable featurettes\\". =Remake= On July 31, 2010 the story's author stated in an NPR All Things Considered interview that Gossip Girl co-creator Josh Schwartz would remake an updated version of the film.

The z-axis is vertical, and the foci are at ±2. The red oblate spheroid (flattened sphere) corresponds to μ = 1, whereas the blue half-hyperboloid corresponds to ν = 45°. The azimuth φ = −60° measures the dihedral angle between the green x-z half-plane and the yellow half-plane that includes the point P. The Cartesian coordinates of P are roughly (1.09, −1.89, 1.66). Oblate spheroidal coordinates are a three- dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from rotating the two- dimensional elliptic coordinate system about the non-focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis that separates the foci. Thus, the two foci are transformed into a ring of radius a in the x-y plane. (Rotation about the other axis produces prolate spheroidal coordinates.) Oblate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a limiting case of ellipsoidal coordinates in which the two largest semi-axes are equal in length. Oblate spheroidal coordinates are often useful in solving partial differential equations when the boundary conditions are defined on an oblate spheroid or a hyperboloid of revolution. For example, they played an important role in the calculation of the Perrin friction factors, which contributed to the awarding of the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics to Jean Baptiste Perrin. These friction factors determine the rotational diffusion of molecules, which affects the feasibility of many techniques such as protein NMR and from which the hydrodynamic volume and shape of molecules can be inferred. Oblate spheroidal coordinates are also useful in problems of electromagnetism (e.g., dielectric constant of charged oblate molecules), acoustics (e.g., scattering of sound through a circular hole), fluid dynamics (e.g., the flow of water through a firehose nozzle) and the diffusion of materials and heat (e.g., cooling of a red-hot coin in a water bath) Definition (µ,ν,φ) Figure 2: Plot of the oblate spheroidal coordinates μ and ν in the x-z plane, where φ is zero and a equals one. The curves of constant μ form red ellipses, whereas those of constant ν form cyan half-hyperbolae in this plane. The z-axis runs vertically and separates the foci; the coordinates z and ν always have the same sign. The surfaces of constant μ and ν in three dimensions are obtained by rotation about the z-axis, and are the red and blue surfaces, respectively, in Figure 1.

The reverse is also true, except on the z-axis and the disk in the xy plane inside the focal ring. =Coordinate surfaces= The surfaces of constant μ form oblate spheroids, by the trigonometric identity : \\\\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\mu} + \\\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu} = \\\\cos^{2} u + \\\\sin^{2} u = 1 since they are ellipses rotated about the z-axis, which separates their foci. An ellipse in the x-z plane (Figure 2) has a major semiaxis of length a cosh μ along the x-axis, whereas its minor semiaxis has length a sinh μ along the z-axis. The foci of all the ellipses in the x-z plane are located on the x-axis at ±a. Similarly, the surfaces of constant ν form one-sheet half hyperboloids of revolution by the hyperbolic trigonometric identity : \\\\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\cos^{2} u} - \\\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sin^{2} u} = \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\mu - \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu = 1 For positive ν, the half-hyperboloid is above the x-y plane (i.e., has positive z) whereas for negative ν, the half- hyperboloid is below the x-y plane (i.e., has negative z). Geometrically, the angle ν corresponds to the angle of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The foci of all the hyperbolae are likewise located on the x-axis at ±a. =Inverse transformation= The (μ, ν, φ) coordinates may be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) as follows. The azimuthal angle φ is given by the formula : \\\\tan \\\\phi = \\\\frac{y}{x} The cylindrical radius ρ of the point P is given by : \\\\rho^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2} and its distances to the foci in the plane defined by φ is given by : d_{1}^{2} = (\\\\rho + a)^{2} + z^{2} : d_{2}^{2} = (\\\\rho - a)^{2} + z^{2} The remaining coordinates μ and ν can be calculated from the equations : \\\\cosh \\\\mu = \\\\frac{d_{1} + d_{2}}{2a} : \\\\cos u = \\\\frac{d_{1} - d_{2}}{2a} where the sign of μ is always non-negative, and the sign of ν is the same as that of z. Another method to compute the inverse transform is : \\\\mu = \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\operatorname{arcosh} \\\\frac{\\\\rho + z i}{a} : u = \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\operatorname{arcosh} \\\\frac{\\\\rho + z i}{a} : \\\\phi = \\\\arctan \\\\frac{y}{x} where : \\\\rho = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} =Scale factors= The scale factors for the coordinates μ and ν are equal : h_{\\\\mu} = h_{ u} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u} whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals : h_{\\\\phi} = a \\\\cosh\\\\mu \\\\ \\\\cos u Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals : dV = a^{3} \\\\cosh\\\\mu \\\\ \\\\cos u \\\\ \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u \\\\right) d\\\\mu d u d\\\\phi and the Laplacian can be written : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2}\\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u \\\\right)} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cosh \\\\mu} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos u} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u} \\\\left( \\\\cos u \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right) \\\\right] + \\\\frac{1}{a^{2} \\\\cosh^{2}\\\\mu \\\\cos^{2} u} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^{2}} Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (μ, ν, φ) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. =Basis Vectors= The orthonormal basis vectors for the \\\\mu, u,\\\\phi coordinate system can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as : \\\\hat{e}_{\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sinh^2 \\\\mu + \\\\sin^2 u}} \\\\left( \\\\sinh \\\\mu \\\\cos u \\\\cos \\\\phi \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{i}} + \\\\sinh \\\\mu \\\\cos u \\\\sin \\\\phi \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{j}} + \\\\cosh \\\\mu \\\\sin u \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{k}}\\\\right) : \\\\hat{e}_{ u} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sinh^2 \\\\mu + \\\\sin^2 u}} \\\\left( -\\\\cosh \\\\mu \\\\sin u \\\\cos \\\\phi \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{i}} - \\\\cosh \\\\mu \\\\sin u \\\\sin \\\\phi \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{j}} + \\\\sinh \\\\mu \\\\cos u \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{k}} \\\\right) : \\\\hat{e}_{\\\\phi} = -\\\\sin \\\\phi \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{i}} + \\\\cos \\\\phi \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{j}} where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{i}}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{j}}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{k}} are the Cartesian unit vectors. Here, \\\\hat{e}_{\\\\mu} is the outward normal vector to the oblate spheroidal surface of constant \\\\mu, \\\\hat{e}_{\\\\phi} is the same azimuthal unit vector from spherical coordinates, and \\\\hat{e}_{ u} lies in the tangent plane to the oblate spheroid surface and completes the right- handed basis set. Definition (ζ, ξ, φ) Another set of oblate spheroidal coordinates (\\\\zeta,\\\\xi,\\\\phi) are sometimes used where \\\\zeta = \\\\sinh \\\\mu and \\\\xi = \\\\sin u (Smythe 1968). The curves of constant \\\\zeta are oblate spheroids and the curves of constant \\\\xi are the hyperboloids of revolution. The coordinate \\\\zeta is restricted by 0 \\\\le \\\\zeta < \\\\infty and \\\\xi is restricted by -1 \\\\le \\\\xi < 1. The relationship to Cartesian coordinates is :x = a\\\\sqrt{(1+\\\\zeta^2)(1-\\\\xi^2)}\\\\,\\\\cos \\\\phi :y = a\\\\sqrt{(1+\\\\zeta^2)(1-\\\\xi^2)}\\\\,\\\\sin \\\\phi :z = a \\\\zeta \\\\xi =Scale factors= The scale factors for (\\\\zeta, \\\\xi, \\\\phi) are: : h_{\\\\zeta} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^2 + \\\\xi^2}{1+\\\\zeta^2}} : h_{\\\\xi} = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^2 + \\\\xi^2}{1 - \\\\xi^2}} : h_{\\\\phi} = a\\\\sqrt{(1+\\\\zeta^2)(1 - \\\\xi^2)} Knowing the scale factors, various functions of the coordinates can be calculated by the general method outlined in the orthogonal coordinates article. The infinitesimal volume element is: : dV = a^{3} (\\\\zeta^2+\\\\xi^2)\\\\,d\\\\zeta\\\\,d\\\\xi\\\\,d\\\\phi The gradient is: : abla V = \\\\frac{1}{h_{\\\\zeta}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} \\\\,\\\\hat{\\\\zeta}+ \\\\frac{1} {h_{\\\\xi}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\xi} \\\\,\\\\hat{\\\\xi}+ \\\\frac{1} {h_{\\\\phi}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\,\\\\hat{\\\\phi} The divergence is: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\frac{1}{a(\\\\zeta^2+\\\\xi^2)} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\zeta^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\zeta^2+\\\\xi^2}F_\\\\zeta\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial} {\\\\partial \\\\xi} \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\xi^2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\zeta^2+\\\\xi^2}F_\\\\xi\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} +\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\zeta^2}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\xi^2}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_\\\\phi}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} and the Laplacian equals : abla^{2} V = \\\\frac{1}{a^2 \\\\left( \\\\zeta^2 + \\\\xi^2 \\\\right)} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} \\\\left[ \\\\left(1+\\\\zeta^2\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\zeta} \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi} \\\\left[ \\\\left( 1 - \\\\xi^2 \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\xi} \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{a^2 \\\\left( 1+\\\\zeta^2 \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\xi^{2} \\\\right)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^{2}} = Oblate spheroidal harmonics = : See also Oblate spheroidal wave function. As is the case with spherical coordinates and spherical harmonics, Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of separation of variables to yield solutions in the form of oblate spheroidal harmonics, which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate. Following the technique of separation of variables, a solution to Laplace's equation is written: :V=Z(\\\\zeta)\\\\,\\\\Xi(\\\\xi)\\\\,\\\\Phi(\\\\phi) This yields three separate differential equations in each of the variables: :\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\zeta}\\\\left[(1+\\\\zeta^2)\\\\frac{dZ }{d\\\\zeta}\\\\right]+\\\\frac{m^2Z }{1+\\\\zeta^2}-n(n+1)Z =0 :\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\xi }\\\\left[(1-\\\\xi^2 )\\\\frac{d\\\\Xi}{d\\\\xi }\\\\right]-\\\\frac{m^2\\\\Xi}{1-\\\\xi^2 }+n(n+1)\\\\Xi=0 :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\Phi}{d\\\\phi^2}=-m^2\\\\Phi where m is a constant which is an integer because the φ variable is periodic with period 2π. n will then be an integer. The solution to these equations are: :Z_{mn} =A_1P_n^m(i\\\\zeta)+A_2Q_n^m(i\\\\zeta) :\\\\Xi_{mn} =A_3P_n^m(\\\\xi)+A_4Q_n^m(\\\\xi) :\\\\Phi_m =A_5e^{im\\\\phi}+A_6e^{-im\\\\phi} where the A_i are constants and P_n^m(z) and Q_n^m(z) are associated Legendre polynomials of the first and second kind respectively. The product of the three solutions is called an oblate spheroidal harmonic and the general solution to Laplace's equation is written: :V=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty\\\\,Z_{mn}(\\\\zeta)\\\\,\\\\Xi_{mn}(\\\\xi)\\\\,\\\\Phi_m(\\\\phi) The constants will combine to yield only four independent constants for each harmonic. Definition (σ, τ, φ) Figure 3: Coordinate isosurfaces for a point P (shown as a black sphere) in the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ). As before, the oblate spheroid corresponding to σ is shown in red, and φ measures the azimuthal angle between the green and yellow half-planes. However, the surface of constant τ is a full one-sheet hyperboloid, shown in blue. This produces a two-fold degeneracy, shown by the two black spheres located at (x, y, ±z). An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are sometimes used, where σ = cosh μ and τ = cos ν.Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 752. Therefore, the coordinate σ must be greater than or equal to one, whereas τ must lie between ±1, inclusive. The surfaces of constant σ are oblate spheroids, as were those of constant μ, whereas the curves of constant τ are full hyperboloids of revolution, including the half-hyperboloids corresponding to ±ν. Thus, these coordinates are degenerate; two points in Cartesian coordinates (x, y, ±z) map to one set of coordinates (σ, τ, φ). This two-fold degeneracy in the sign of z is evident from the equations transforming from oblate spheroidal coordinates to the Cartesian coordinates : x = a\\\\sigma\\\\tau \\\\cos \\\\phi : y = a\\\\sigma\\\\tau \\\\sin \\\\phi : z^{2} = a^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right) The coordinates \\\\sigma and \\\\tau have a simple relation to the distances to the focal ring. For any point, the sum d_{1}+d_{2} of its distances to the focal ring equals 2a\\\\sigma, whereas their difference d_{1}-d_{2} equals 2a\\\\tau. Thus, the \\"far\\" distance to the focal ring is a(\\\\sigma+\\\\tau), whereas the \\"near\\" distance is a(\\\\sigma-\\\\tau). =Coordinate surfaces= Similar to its counterpart μ, the surfaces of constant σ form oblate spheroids : \\\\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\sigma^{2}} + \\\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\left(\\\\sigma^{2} -1\\\\right)} = 1 Similarly, the surfaces of constant τ form full one-sheet hyperboloids of revolution : \\\\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\tau^{2}} - \\\\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right)} = 1 =Scale factors= The scale factors for the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, \\\\phi) are : h_\\\\sigma = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 - \\\\tau^2}{\\\\sigma^2 - 1}} : h_\\\\tau = a\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 - \\\\tau^2}{1 - \\\\tau^{2}}} whereas the azimuthal scale factor is h_{\\\\phi} = a \\\\sigma \\\\tau. Hence, the infinitesimal volume element can be written : dV = a^3 \\\\sigma \\\\tau \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 - \\\\tau^2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\sigma^2 - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\tau^2 \\\\right)}} \\\\, d\\\\sigma \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\, d\\\\phi and the Laplacian equals : abla^2 \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1}{a^2 \\\\left( \\\\sigma^2 - \\\\tau^2 \\\\right)} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^2 -1}}{\\\\sigma} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma^2 - 1} \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\sigma} \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tau^2}}{\\\\tau} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\tau\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tau^2} \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{a^2 \\\\sigma^2 \\\\tau^2 } \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^2} Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\sigma, \\\\tau) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. As is the case with spherical coordinates, Laplaces equation may be solved by the method of separation of variables to yield solutions in the form of oblate spheroidal harmonics, which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

The manner in which duct tape appears to work is unclear. The tape might create a macerating and keratolytic environment, stimulating an immune response. The type of adhesive in the duct tape may also be important. Side effects are rare, although skin irritation may occur. There is mixed evidence that occlusive treatment with various types of duct tape is effective. Clinical trials in 2012 concluded that no statistically significant difference between clear duct tape and placebo could be determined within the sample. On health information websites, duct tape is referred to as a treatment with mixed evidence of efficacy, no good evidence or described as alternative medicine.  Evidence  In 1978, Jerome Z Litt was the first to suggest that adhesive tape could be used to treat warts on the fingers. He claimed: \\"My method is safe, easy, simple, painless, inexpensive, and highly effective. It leaves no scarring or deformed nails. The mystery remains: How and why does this method work? I cannot offer any reasonable or logical explanation. It cannot be all 'hypnotic' or 'suggestive.' Could it be that the airtight occlusion and a chemical reaction set up by the adhesive in the tape might combine to release a chemical or 'toxin' causing the formation of antibodies? Whatever it may be, it works. I recommend that you try it.\\" A 2002 study involved 51 individuals (aged 3–22) treated with either \\"standard duct tape\\" (not otherwise specified in the study) or cryotherapy. A piece of duct tape was cut as close to the size of the wart as possible, and applied to the area. The tape was left on for 6 days and replaced with new duct tape if it fell off. After 6 days, the tape was removed, the area soaked in water, and the wart debrided with an emery board or pumice stone. The tape was left off overnight and reapplied on the following morning. This process continued for up to 2 months or until the wart was resolved, whichever occurred first. Progress was monitored every 4 weeks. The researchers found the duct tape treatment significantly more effective than the cryotherapy (P=0.05) with 85% in the duct tape treatment group having a complete resolution of their wart, compared to 60% in the cryotherapy group. The study was criticized due to lack of a placebo control group, and because a number of outcome assessments were done by phone. There was also no reported long term follow up to ensure no recurrence of the warts. Two later studies failed to repeat the results of the 2002 study. One compared duct tape with moleskin, finding no statistically significant difference in results reported between the two groups. The other used 3M clear duct tape, again concluding no statistically significant effect on wart resolution. The statistical power of the latter trial has been questioned, and it has been suggested that duct tape occlusion therapy only works with rubber-based adhesives, whereas these studies utilized acrylic-based adhesive.

It is thought that the name may have originated from a comment made by the owner, Isaac Knowles, asserting that the glaze of the pieces resembled the glossy sheen of lotus blossom petals. These ceramics were ranked at the top at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, where they won every prize for fine porcelain.Catherine S. Vodrey, \\"Lotus Ware\\" , The Museum of Ceramics, 2013, accessed 12 June 2014 It is generally considered to be the finest porcelain ever produced in the United States. Knowles, Taylor & Knowles Knowles, Taylor & Knowles Pottery in 1887 Isaac Knowles started his pottery in East Liverpool in 1854. He produced Rockingham pottery, yellow Queen's ware, and ceramic canning jars. The operation expanded and in 1870, John Taylor and Homer S. Knowles joined the company. By 1880, KT&K; was the largest pottery maker in East Liverpool.\\"Lotus Ware Ewer\\", Ohio Pix, Ohio Historical Society, accessed 12 June 2014 By the 1880s, it was producing translucent china. By 1890, the company was the largest manufacturer of white granite plain and decorative ware in the nation. In the late 19th century, factories in the city produced nearly half of all American domestic and hotel ware. The KT&K; management was forward-thinking in establishing an in-house design-and-decoration shop instead of using outside designers. KT&K; had, by 1888, purchased another pottery and constructed another plant with eight kilns. The company also constructed a plant dedicated exclusively to the production of bone china. In the United States, bone china had previously been made only in Trenton, New Jersey. Before KT&K;'s efforts, another East Liverpool potter, John Burgess, and his son-in-law, Willis Cunning, had briefly attempted to produce bone china. Their operation was short-lived, shuttered by East Liverpool City Council, which declared the odor of calcined bones to be a health hazard. The porcelain plant was KT&K;'s entry into serious competition with European manufacturers. After a year and a half of operation, KT&K;'s porcelain plant burned down in November 1889. The plant was soon rebuilt, and Lotus Ware appeared on the market again from 1892. Lotus Ware was perfected by two men. An Englishman named Joshua Poole had arrived in East Liverpool after having worked for the Belleek pottery in County Fermanagh, northern Ireland. Owner Isaac Knowles wanted to manufacture beautiful art porcelain. Joshua Poole's training as a ceramic engineer was a considerable aid to Knowles' search for the ideal blend of beauty and strength. Poole was in charge of formulating the clay bodies. The other man responsible for Lotus Ware was Heinrich Schmidt, a German immigrant. He had experience as a decorator, or \\"fancy worker\\" in late 19th-century pottery slang, having worked at the renowned Meissen factory in Germany. At KT&K; he was responsible for preparing the Lotus Ware slip. By committing the slip recipe to memory and refusing to keep a written version, Schmidt kept its formulation secret. His goal was that KT&K; sell only perfect Lotus Ware. This product was first publicly introduced and exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where it swept the competition. Stylistic influences The idealized depiction of the natural world common to the then- fashionable Art Nouveau style was a significant influence: the twining tendrils, leaves, blossoms, shells and coral branches were formed and applied mainly by hand, but occasionally the difficult pâté-sur-pâté (\\"paste upon paste\\") technique was employed. Moorish and Persian influences were also evident, including ornate arched shapes, stylized swirls, and an excess of minute detail such as netting, fish- scale patterning, and tiny enamel-like dots, which appear like inset jewels on the ware's surface. Technique Schmidt used a technique called tube-lining. In this a thick slip is applied via a pastry bag. He then constructed plaster of Paris molds on which the designs were worked out and allowed to dry. These were gently removed from the molds and attached to the main body of the ware with fresh slip. After that further painted decoration, glazing and firing took place. Fundamental Lotus Ware forms were produced only in three colors: pure white, celadon and a deep shade of olive green, which was extremely popular in Europe in the late 19th century. Sometimes additional decoration in only a few other colors, especially a saturated shade of lavender, was used, but all other color was added only in the form of hand-painted decoration and (very rarely) decals. Lotus Ware forms all bore classical names such as Syrian, Thebian, Lanconian and Grecian. This was due to the fact that the company intended to promote an image of classic, high-quality ware. Financial losses and the end of Lotus Ware Because of the refinements of the process and decorative elements, the production losses of Lotus Ware were very high, estimated to be as high as 90%. Despite the heavy financial losses incurred by its high manufacturing losses, KT&K; continued to produce Lotus Ware until approximately 1896. The company continued to flourish until the 1920s, but started to decline and eventually closed for good in 1931. An estimated 5,000 pieces of Lotus Ware survive.

Basic formulae The Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) can be produced from the ellipsoidal coordinates ( \\\\lambda, \\\\mu, u ) by the equations : x^{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\left( a^{2} + \\\\lambda \\\\right) \\\\left( a^{2} + \\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( a^{2} + u \\\\right)}{\\\\left( a^{2} - b^{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( a^{2} - c^{2} \\\\right)} : y^{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\left( b^{2} + \\\\lambda \\\\right) \\\\left( b^{2} + \\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( b^{2} + u \\\\right)}{\\\\left( b^{2} - a^{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( b^{2} - c^{2} \\\\right)} : z^{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\left( c^{2} + \\\\lambda \\\\right) \\\\left( c^{2} + \\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( c^{2} + u \\\\right)}{\\\\left( c^{2} - b^{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( c^{2} - a^{2} \\\\right)} where the following limits apply to the coordinates : \\\\- \\\\lambda < c^{2} < \\\\- \\\\mu < b^{2} < - u < a^{2}. Consequently, surfaces of constant \\\\lambda are ellipsoids : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \\\\lambda} + \\\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \\\\lambda} + \\\\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \\\\lambda} = 1, whereas surfaces of constant \\\\mu are hyperboloids of one sheet : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + \\\\mu} + \\\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + \\\\mu} + \\\\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + \\\\mu} = 1, because the last term in the lhs is negative, and surfaces of constant u are hyperboloids of two sheets : \\\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} + u} + \\\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2} + u} + \\\\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2} + u} = 1 because the last two terms in the lhs are negative. The orthogonal system of quadrics used for the ellipsoidal coordinates are confocal quadrics. Scale factors and differential operators For brevity in the equations below, we introduce a function : S(\\\\sigma) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\left( a^{2} + \\\\sigma \\\\right) \\\\left( b^{2} + \\\\sigma \\\\right) \\\\left( c^{2} + \\\\sigma \\\\right) where \\\\sigma can represent any of the three variables (\\\\lambda, \\\\mu, u ). Using this function, the scale factors can be written : h_{\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\lambda - \\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\lambda - u\\\\right)}{S(\\\\lambda)}} : h_{\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\mu - \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mu - u\\\\right)}{S(\\\\mu)}} : h_{ u} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\left( u - \\\\lambda\\\\right) \\\\left( u - \\\\mu\\\\right)}{S( u)}} Hence, the infinitesimal volume element equals : dV = \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\lambda - \\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\lambda - u \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mu - u\\\\right)}{8\\\\sqrt{-S(\\\\lambda) S(\\\\mu) S( u)}} \\\\ d\\\\lambda d\\\\mu d u and the Laplacian is defined by : abla^{2} \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{S(\\\\lambda)}}{\\\\left( \\\\lambda - \\\\mu \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\lambda - u\\\\right)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{S(\\\\lambda)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} \\\\right] \\\\ + ::::: \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{S(\\\\mu)}}{\\\\left( \\\\mu - \\\\lambda \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mu - u\\\\right)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{S(\\\\mu)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} \\\\right] \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{S( u)}}{\\\\left( u - \\\\lambda \\\\right) \\\\left( u - \\\\mu\\\\right)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u} \\\\left[ \\\\sqrt{S( u)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right] Other differential operators such as abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} and abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} can be expressed in the coordinates (\\\\lambda, \\\\mu, u) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates.

It debuted in 1958 and went through a series of developments leading to the Mark I to Mark IV and 1800S models. The last ones were made in September 1967. These coupés were hand-built at the TVR factory in Blackpool, England with varying mechanical specifications and could be had in kit form. All cars featured a cocktail of Austin-Healey brakes, VW Beetle or Triumph suspension parts and BMC rear axles. The Grantura bodyshell was made from glass- reinforced plastic and made use of a variety of proprietary components. The bonnet was front hinged. There was no opening at the rear but the boot could be accessed from inside the car - the spare wheel had to be removed through the front doors. Buyers could choose from a range of powerplants which, dependant on the model in question, included a choice of side or overhead valve engines from Ford, a Coventry Climax unit, the engine from the MGA and, ultimately, the 1798cc BMC B-series engine. TOC Mark I The first of the Granturas used a fibreglass body moulded to a tubular steel backbone chassis and VW Beetle-based front and rear suspension. The car was designed around a 1098 cc Coventry Climax type FWA engine but many different makes were fitted from 1172 cc Ford side valve to 1600 cc BMC from the MGA. The drum brakes originated on the Austin-Healey 100 and the windscreen on the Ford Consul. Approximately 100 of the Mark I Grantura were built from 1958 to 1960. Mark II/IIa Grantura Mark II (1961) The Mark II had MGA engines as standard but again customers could choose from a variety of power units. The Mark IIa used the 1622 cc MGA Mark II or Ford 1340 cc engine and front disc brakes were standard. Rack and pinion steering was standardised. A car with a 1600 cc MGA engine was tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1961. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from zero to in twelve seconds. Fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1,298 including taxes. Rear end of 1962 Mark IIa Approximately 400 of the Mark II/IIa Grantura were built.  Mark III, Mark III 1800, 1800S and Mark IV The next series of cars had a completely new, longer and stiffer chassis with innovative coil sprung independent suspension. This chassis was designed by John Thurner and would form the basis of the one used by TVR up to the launch of the 2500M cars in 1972. The Mark III also received a new front end design, with the grille mounted higher and featuring some rudimentary chrome trim. The Mark III and the later Mark III 1800 cars used BMC B-series engines, either 1622 or 1798 cc respectively, although Ford or Coventry Climax units were also available for the earlier Mark III model. The larger capacity 1798 cc MG 'B' series engine became standard equipment around September 1963 although this more powerful engine appears to have been available as a customer-specified option prior to that date. At some point during 1963 the rear of the car was reprofiled to include a number plate mount. In 1965 the latest version of the car became available as the 1800S with a cut off, square back (called a 'Manx tail' after the similarly tailless breed of cat) and round rear light clusters from the Ford Cortina. The 1798cc B-series engine remained but the chassis used for the 1800S and all subsequent Granturas was a modified version that, through an alteration to the line of the top chassis rails, allowed more space for the engine to fit in. This was an alteration made to the Grantura chassis to allow it also to be used as the basis for the new Griffith, a car that sported a V8 engine which was larger both in capacity and physical dimension. After a pause in production during late 1965, under Martin Lilley's new ownership the 1800S reappeared in early 1966 rebadged as the Mark III 1800S. This was quickly followed by the new Mk IV model. The Mk IV featured a longer wheelbase, more luxurious trim and a larger fuel tank and was the first TVR to benefit from Martin Lilley's influence. Approximately 300 of the Mark III, Mark III 1800, 1800S and MkIV cars were built (estimated to be 60 of the Mark III, 30 to 35 of the Mark III 1800, 128 of the 1800S / Mark III 1800S and 78 of the Mk IV) before being replaced in 1967 by the Vixen. Cortina taillights The TVR Grantura in pre-1966 Historic Racing The larger-engined Mark III 1800 model of the TVR Grantura was first introduced as a road car in September 1963 and subsequently homologated for racing in April 1964. Although it is the rarest variant of the Grantura, it is by far the most popular version for pre-1966 historic competition. The main reasons are that, in addition to the obvious benefits of the more powerful 1798cc BMC 'B' engine over the previous 1622cc unit, the 1964 homologation allowed use of a limited slip differential as well as wider wheel rims (5\\") than those permitted on the earlier 1962/63 Mk III cars (4\\" or 4.5\\"). Then, in June 1965 an extension of the homologation allowed the car to run on even wider wheels (6\\"). As a result, the June 1965 specification is the ultimate form of the car for use in pre-1966 racing and the one that almost all racing Granturas are built to conform to in historic competition. As a competition car the TVR Grantura MkIII benefits from being eligible for a wide range of historic racing and, due to its relatively light weight and good handling characteristics, it can be very effective when competing against some of the larger engined cars, especially when, as almost all examples are, it is in the June 1965 homologated Mk III 1800 trim. Although the earlier initial version of the Mark III had its own distinct set of homologation papers dated August 1962, for racing purposes many of the cars that would have originally started on the production line as this 1962/63 model have been since modified to run to the later Mark III 1800 specification from the 1964/65 seasons. Only around 30 to 35 examples of the Grantura are thought to have left the factory in true Mk III 1800 specification in the period between late 1963 and mid-1965. The smaller engined 1622cc Mark III cars built to the August 1962 specification are eligible to run in high profile Pre-63 events including the prestigious bi-annual Classic Le Mans race for cars that competed in period in the Le Mans 24 hours race.

Defensive medicine is a reaction to the rising costs of malpractice insurance premiums and patients’ biases on suing for missed or delayed diagnosis or treatment but not for being overdiagnosed. U.S. physicians are at highest risk of being sued, and overtreatment is common. The number of lawsuits against physicians in the USA has increased within the last decades and has had a substantial impact on the behavior of physicians and medical practice. Physicians order tests and avoid treating high-risk patients (when they have a choice) to reduce their exposure to lawsuits, or are forced to discontinue practicing because of overly high insurance premiums. This behavior has become known as defensive medicine, \\"a deviation from sound medical practice that is indicated primarily by a threat of liability\\".  Forms  Defensive medicine takes two main forms: assurance behavior and avoidance behavior. Assurance behavior involves the charging of additional, unnecessary services to a) reduce adverse outcomes, b) deter patients from filing medical malpractice claims, or c) preempt any future legal action by documenting that the practitioner is practicing according to the standard of care. Avoidance behavior occurs when providers refuse to participate in high risk procedures or circumstances.  Examples  In 2004, the case of Dr. Daniel Merenstein triggered an intensive debate in scientific journals and media on defensive medicine (e.g.,) Following the guidelines of several well- respected national organizations, Merenstein had explained the pros and cons of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to a patient, rather than simply ordering the test. He then documented the shared decision not to order the test. Later, the patient was diagnosed with incurable advanced prostate cancer, and Merenstein and his residency were sued for not ordering the test. Although Merenstein was acquitted, his residency was found liable for $1 million. Ever since this ordeal, he regards his patients as potential plaintiffs: 'I order more tests now, am more nervous around patients: I am no longer the doctor I should be'.Lapp, T. (2005) Clinical guidelines in court: it’s a tug of war. American Academy of Family Physicians Report, 2005. Available at: (last accessed 12 February 2008). Rates of Caesarean section have been found to increase by an average of 8% as seen after 2.5 years following a related medical error. In a study with 824 US surgeons, obstetricians, and other specialists at high risk of litigation, 93% reported practicing defensive medicine, such as ordering unnecessary CT scans, biopsies, and MRIs, and prescribing more antibiotics than medically indicated. In Switzerland, where litigation is less common, 41% of general practitioners and 43% of internists, reported that they sometimes or often recommend PSA tests for legal reasons. The practice of defensive medicine also expresses itself in discrepancies between what treatments doctors recommend to patients, and what they recommend to their own families. In Switzerland, for instance, the rate of hysterectomy in the general population is 16%, whereas among female doctors and female partners of doctors it is only 10%.  Consequences  = Financial = Defensive medical decision making has spread to many areas of clinical medicine and is seen as a major factor in the increase in health care costs, estimated at tens of billions of dollars annually in the US. An analysis of a random sample of 1452 closed malpractice claims from five U.S. liability insurers showed that the average time between injury and resolution was 5 years. Indemnity costs were $376 million, and defense administration cost $73 million, resulting in total costs of $449 million. The system's overhead costs were exorbitant: 35% of the indemnity payments went to the plaintiffs' attorneys, and together with defense costs, the total costs of litigation amounted to 54% of the compensation paid to plaintiffs. = Patient care = Theoretical arguments based on utilitarianism conclude that defensive medicine is, on average, harmful to patients. Malpractice suits are often seen as a mechanism to improve the quality of care, but with custom-based liability, they actually impede the translation of evidence into practice, harming patients and decreasing the quality of care. Tort law in many countries and jurisdictions not only discourages but actively penalizes physicians who practice evidence-based medicine.  Similar phenomena outside healthcare  Defensive decision making does not only occur in health care but also in business and politics. For instance, managers of large international companies report making defensive decisions in one third to half of all cases, on average.Gigerenzer, G. (2014) Risk savvy: How to make good decisions. New York: Viking. That means, these managers pursue options that are second best for their company but protect themselves in case something goes wrong.

The Isle of Man Examiner title was later revived by the Halifax Courier Group, owner of the Isle of Man Courier. The original concept for the Manx Independent came from a local Manx man named Harold Stanley Corlett, affectionately known as Stan Corlett (1934-1992) son of Edith Isabel (Taggart) and James Stanley Corlett. Stan Corlett (Director at Mercantile) previously served as a councillor for Wokingham and had also taught economics at Ashridge Business School in Hertfordshire returned to the Isle of Man in 1976 at the age of 43 with the mission of finding a way to \\"Give a voice to the Manx people\\". Later he was to join the Mercantile Group and see his dream become a reality in developing a newspaper that was unafraid to cover current issues affecting the island's residents. For a short time the Manx Independent was published three times a week, produced by the former IOM Weekly Times staff and edited by Simon Richardson. It then became a twice-weekly tabloid, originally owned by Mercantile Publishers and then sold to Morton Newspapers from Northern Ireland in the early 1992.

History A Native American village, known as Chequamegon, developed here in the mid-17th century. It was developed by refugee Petun, Huron, and Ottawa, who were fleeing the Beaver Wars and Iroquois invasions from the East after 1649. Later, Ojibwe people came here to trade, but they were not among the first settlers, according to archeological evidence. The end of Chequamegon Bay is known as the site of the first dwelling in present-day Wisconsin to have been occupied by European men. Two French fur traders, Médard des Groseilliers and Pierre-Esprit Radisson, built a hut somewhere on the west shore of the bay, probably in 1658. Other traders dwelt on this bay in 1660-1663 and were visited in the spring of 1661 by Father René Menard, the first Jesuit missionary to the Northwest. In 1665 Father Claude Allouez built a mission house near the southwest end of the bay. His successor, Father Jacques Marquette, came in 1669 and remained for two years. In 1693 Pierre LeSueur built a fort on the largest island (now known as Madeline Island), located at the mouth of the bay. It was abandoned by the French before the close of the century. In 1718 a French fort was built on the island where Louis Denis de la Ronde had a post for fur trading and exploration for copper mines. Called La Pointe, the fort had a French garrison until 1759, during the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War in North America). The first English trader to reach this distant post was Alexander Henry the elder, whose French partner, Jean Baptiste Cadotte, founded a permanent trading post at this place. In 1818 two Massachusetts traders, Lyman and Truman Warren, came here. They married daughters of Michel Cadotte, a fur trader and a son of Jean Baptiste. He bequeathed his interests to the Warren brothers; they became the leading American fur traders of the region. Truman Warren died early; Lyman maintained his home at La Pointe until his death in 1847. During the early 19th century, a village developed around the post, made up of retired voyageurs and fur traders. John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company had a post here for many years. The first Protestant mission in Wisconsin was founded here in 1831. =Name origin= Ashland The name Chequamegon is of Ojibwe origin. It is derived from chagaouamigoung, a French transliteration of the Ojibwe Zhaagawaamikong or jagawamikiong, meaning a \\"sand bar place; at the sand bar; strip of land running into a body of water\\". Geography Chequamegon Bay lies largely inside the barrier of Chequamegon Point and Long Island, with the Bad River Indian Reservation to the east. Ashland, Wisconsin is on its south, Washburn, Wisconsin is on its north. The Chequamegon National Forest lies largely south and west.

In 2000 was described by the Sunday Times as \\"one of the 12 greatest shows on earth\\" and was listed in the 1987 AA Travel Guide as one of Europe's Seven Best Festivals. The Galway International Oyster Festival was created to celebrate the Galway Native Oyster as it is a unique feature of Galway City & County. Hotel Manager, Brian Collins had been searching for something unique to attract more visitors to Galway in what was then, a quieter month of the year. Collins discussed the idea with the folk at Guinness and Patrick M. Burke's Bar in Clarenbridge and the first Galway Oyster Festival was created in 1954 with a whole 34 attendees.Thanks for the Memories, 1954-1994, Forty Years of The Galway International Oyster Festival The festival was originally held in Clarenbridge village during the day and the Great Southern Hotel in Galway City at night until the mid-1980s when it grew so large, all of the festivities were held in the city centre of Galway. There was a red & white striped marquee at Spanish Arch and then at Nimmo's Pier by the Claddagh. In order to reduce ticket prices, the festival changed location to The Radisson Hotel Galway in 2009 but due to popular demand, the marquee was brought back in 2011, located in the Docks and the festival was renamed as the Galway International Oyster & Seafood Festival. In 2014, the 60th anniversary of the event, its producers, Milestone Inventive, brought it back to its original Galway City home at the aptly named Fishmarket at the Spanish Arch. The main events are two Oyster Opening Championships, the Irish Oyster Opening Championship and the World Oyster Opening Championship. Other events include a Masquerade Gala 'Mardi-Gras', a seafood trail, a silent disco and a family day featuring everything from cookery demonstrations, to jazz, to circus skills workshops.

The zoo was opened in 1958, and an average elevation of , is the largest high altitude zoo in India. It specializes in breeding animals adapted to alpine conditions, and has successful captive breeding programs for the snow leopard, the critically endangered Himalayan wolf and the red panda. The zoo attracts about 300,000 visitors every year. The park is named after Padmaja Naidu (1900–1975), daughter of Sarojini Naidu. The zoo serves as the central hub for Central Zoo Authority of India's red panda program and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. History A zoo was established on 14 August 1958 in the Birch Hill neighbourhood of Darjeeling under the Department of Education of the Government of West Bengal with a goal to study and preserve Himalayan fauna. Its first Director and founder was Dilip Kumar Dey. Mr. Dey, who belonged to the Indian Forest Service was on deputation to the Department of Education for the express purpose of establishing a high- altitude zoological park specializing mainly in Himalayan flora and fauna. The park's prized possessions were a pair of Siberian (Ussuri) tigers presented to the Government of India by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1960. Over the years famous names in the world of Conservation have been attracted to and have visited the HZP. The zoo now contains endangered animals like snow leopards, red pandas, gorals (mountain goat), Siberian tigers and a variety of endangered birds. However, there has been concern regarding the fact that the Himalayan animals may face a threat due to rising temperatures in the hilly area. In January 1972, the park became a registered society, with an agreement that maintenance costs would be shared by the central and state governments. In May 1993, the park was transferred to the West Bengal Department of Forests. The park was renamed in 1975 when Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, visited the park and dedicated it to the memory of Padmaja Naidu. Conservation Red panda in the zoo The zoo includes an off-display breeding center for snow leopards and red pandas. Captive breeding of snow leopards was started in 1983, with leopards which were brought to the zoo from Zurich, the United States, and Leh-Ladakh. The red panda program was started in 1994 with individuals from the Cologne Zoo, the Madrid Zoo, Belgium, and the Rotterdam Zoo. In addition to these species, the zoo is breeding the Himalayan tahr, blue sheep, Himalayan monal, grey peacock pheasant, Himalayan salamander, blood pheasant and satyr tragopan. The zoo is famous for its conservation breeding programmes of the red panda, Himalayan salamander, Tibetan wolf, and snow leopard.

The town sits on the left bank of the Urumea river. It is located at a distance of 9.2 km from San Sebastián. The municipality of Hernani occupies an area of approximately 40 square kilometres and is bordered by San Sebastián, Astigarraga, Arano, Elduayen, Errenteria, Lasarte-Oria and Urnieta. From the town centre, at the foot of Mount Santa Barbara, it is possible to see a large area of the valley of Urumea. Its festivities, held between 23 and 27 June in honour of John the Baptist; and between his celebrations the popular \\"azeri dantza\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVEQCpXgTYY Vídeo del Baile de la Azeri-Dantza o Maskuridantza San Juan 2009 (YouTube) (also celebrated in celebrations of Carnival) should be emphasized. The title character of Victor Hugo's play Hernani is named after the town. History Darío de Regoyos, Hernani landscape, 1900 (Málaga, Carmen Thyssen Museum). During the Middle Ages, the territory that would form the province of Gipuzkoa was divided in valleys and Hernani was one of them. The valley of Hernani formerly extended through all the space surrounding the lower courses of the rivers Urumea and Oria . The valley of Hernani is first attested in a document whereby the Castilian count Fernán González of Castile grants vows in favour of the Monasteries of San Millan de la Cogolla, dating from the year 938 but believed to be a fake document from the thirteenth century. Dated from the late twelfth century, the donation document of the Monastery of San Sebastián to the Monastery of Leyre in Navarre by the king Sancho VI of Navarre states that the monastery of San Sebastián was in the borders of Hernani. When this Navarrese king founded the town of San Sebastián around 1180, the territory of the valley of Hernani was included within the jurisdiction of the new coastal town. It is not known when Hernani turned into a town, with its charter being lost in a fire along with other files. Some assume that the foundation of the town occurred during the reign of the king Alfonso X of Castile in the second half of the 13th century, when this king established a network of strategic towns dotting the route reaching the coast of Gipuzkoa, with Hernani as one of its strategic localities. Others delay the foundation of the town until the late 14th century in 1379, as a document of the 15th century cites an agreement between the councils of Hernani and San Sebastián for the use of the mountains of the valley of Urumea that took place in 1379, which attests to the existence by that time of the town Hernani. The town of Hernani extended its jurisdiction only to part of the old valley. It lost all the coastal and lower valley of Urumea now included in the San Sebastián strip, and the western area in the valley of the Oria, which became the town of Usurbil in 1371. Its western limit continued to be the Oria river, while on the east the mountains separated it from Oiartzun. The old town of Hernani sits on a 42 metres high rise towering over the left bank of the river Urumea and in turn located at the foot of Mount Santa Barbara. The old town was oval in shape, surrounded by walls with several entrances, of which only one (in Felipe Sagarna \\"Zapa\\" street) is surviving to date. It was originally made up of two streets, the High Street, Kale Nagusia, and Kardaberaz Street, intersected at the same time by a perpendicular lane (streets Nafarroa and its extension Felipe Sagarna \\"Zapa\\"). The first municipal ordinances go back to 1542, since copies of the 1512 ordinances disappeared during an invasion of the French army. The town has been subject to invasions and destruction numerous times throughout its history: the medieval factional wars, French invasions in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; as well as the hard sieges during the Carlist Wars and finally the 1936 Spanish Civil War. In 1986, Lasarte, a historical district of Hernani located in the valley of Oria, detached from the town following its rapid urban and demographic development. Culture =Language= Inside of a Sagardotegi The town lies on a traditionally Basque-speaking area, with the municipality showing a Basque- Spanish bilingual landscape. =Leisure= Hernani is the biggest and most important of the towns with strong tradition in the artisan production of Basque cider. Together with Astigarraga and Usúrbil it is one of the areas where most of the Guipuzcoan cider houses (called sagardotegiak) are concentrated. There are many of these establishments in the city. During cider season (traditionally starting the Friday before 20 January and lasting until the end of May) the locality welcomes numerous visitors who come from Gipuzkoa and neighbouring provinces to the cider houses. The bars of the old town of Hernani usually have a special animation during the weekends this time thanks to these visitors. =Celebration= The town festivities are held at the end of June, coinciding with the feast of St. John the Baptist (24 June). It is traditional that on the days 24, 25 and 26 June, coinciding with the celebrations, the previously mentioned Maskuri-danza (dance of the bladder) or Azeri-danza (dance of the fox) is held, a traditional dance, and now mostly known by the latter name because in the 1980s, a character with a mask made of a fox who accompanied him was added. The neighbourhoods of Hernani also celebrate their own festivals: Elizatxo Santa Cruz, Ereñozu San Antonio, Santa Barbara San Ignacio, El Puerto, the martyrdom of John the Baptist and Zikuñaga the Virgin of Zikuñaga. Gudaris square. Parochial Church of San Juan Bautista and Town Hall. =Monuments= The town of Hernani, formerly walled, is cataloged as Monumental Ensemble.

Demography From the 1960s, there was a great increase in population, due mainly to the influx of workers from other regions of Spain (Castilla y Leon, Andalusia and Extremadura, mainly), attracted by work in the industry area. This growth paused by the crisis in the industry and the political situation in the late 70s and early 80s. In 1986 came the disengagement of the district of Lasarte, which became part of a newly created town called Lasarte-Oria. That disengagement represented a loss of about 10,000 inhabitants in Hernani. In the last 20 years the population has remained fairly stable.
