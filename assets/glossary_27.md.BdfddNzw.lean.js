Worksop lies on the River Ryton, and is located at the northern edge of Sherwood Forest. Worksop is located east-south-east of Sheffield, with a population of 41,820.citypopulation.info It lies close to Nottinghamshire‚Äôs borders with South Yorkshire, and Derbyshire. Worksop, a market town, has become a commuter town as a result of its geographic location and ease of access to major motorways and rail links. Worksop is known as the \\"Gateway to The Dukeries\\", because of the now four obsolete ducal principal sites of which were closely located next to each other, south of the town. These four ducal locations were; Clumber House, Thoresby Hall, Welbeck Abbey and Worksop Manor. Other houses such as Rufford Abbey and Hodsock Priory are also just a few miles away. Worksop is twinned with the German town Garbsen. History Evidence that Worksop existed before the Norman conquest of England in 1066 is provided by the Domesday Book of 1086: :\\"In Werchesope, (Worksop) Elsi (son of Caschin) had three carucates of land to be taxed. Land to eight ploughs. Roger has one plough in the demesne there, and twenty-two sokemen who hold twelve oxgangs of this land, and twenty-four villanes and eight bordars having twenty-two ploughs, and seven acres of meadow. Wood pasture two miles long, and three quarentens broad.\\"White, Robert (1875) Worksop, The Dukery, and Sherwood Forest. Transcription at Nicholson, AP: Nottinghamshire History (Accessed 24 December 2005). In about 1103, William de Lovetot established a castle and the Augustinian priory at Worksop. Subsequently, Worksop grew into a market town. A skirmish occurred in the area during the Wars of the Roses on 16 December 1460, commonly known as the Battle of Worksop. The building of the Chesterfield Canal in 1777, and the subsequent construction of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1849, both of which passed through the settlement, led to a degree of growth. Discovery of sizeable coal seams further increased interest in the area. Coal mining provided thousands of jobs in and around Worksop for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Additionally, much of the area being heavily forested, timber was always an important industry - supplying railway sleepers to the North Midland Railway, timber for the construction of railway carriages and packing cases for the Sheffield cutlery industry. The town also became notable for the manufacture of Worksop Windsor Chairs. Timber firms in the town included Benjamin Garside‚Äôs woodyard and Godley and Goulding, situated between Eastgate and the railway.Stroud, G. (2002) Nottinghamshire Extensive Urban Survey, Worksop. English Heritage The closure in the 1990s of the pits, compounding the earlier decline of the timber trade and other local industry, resulted in high unemployment and the soaring of local drug abuse. Unemployment levels in the area are now lower than the national average, owing to large number of distribution and local manufacturing companies, including Premier Foods, Wilko, RDS Transport, Pandrol UK Ltd and Laing O'Rourke. Transport=Road= Worksop lies on the A57 and A60 with links to the A1 and M1. =Rail= Worksop is on the Sheffield-Lincoln line, with direct trains running to Sheffield, Leeds.

Religion St Anne's Church Worksop has three churches which are all on the National Heritage List for England. Officially titled the Priory Church of Saint Mary and Saint Cuthbert, is the Anglican parish church usually known as Worksop Priory. It was an Augustinian Priory founded in 1103. The church has a nave and detached gatehouse. Monks at the priory made the Tickhill Psalter, an illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period, now held in New York Public Library. After the dissolution of the Monasteries the east end of the church fell into disrepair, but the townspeople were granted the nave as a parish church. The eastern parts of the building have been restored in several phases, the most recent being in the 1970s when the architect Lawrence King rebuilt the crossing. St. Anne's Church is an Anglican parish church and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The church was built in 1911 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. The church has an historic pipe organ originally built by Gray and Davison in 1852 for Clapham Congregational Church. St. John's Church is a Parish church built between 1867 and 1868 by architect Robert Clarke.

During the weekend of July 4, 1999, Smith targeted members of racial and ethnic minorities in random drive-by shootings in Illinois and Indiana, after which he committed suicide.  Early life  Smith was born and raised in Wilmette, Illinois. He attended high school at New Trier Township High School. During this time he accosted a Skokie, Illinois police officer and plead guilty to two counts of misdemeanor battery.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-07-25/news/9907250249_1_hale- supremacist-young-man He transferred to Mary D. Bradford High School in Kenosha for his senior year. He did not pose for a photograph in his senior yearbook, but in his class statement he wrote, \\"Sic semper tyrannis\\" (Thus always to tyrants). This phrase was shouted by John Wilkes Booth after he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. After graduating, Smith attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Smith dropped out of the university in 1998 after several conflicts with campus authorities. After dropping out, he transferred to Indiana University (Bloomington), where he studied criminal justice. Police reported that Smith was known for passing out hate-filled fliers against Jews, blacks and Asians on university campuses. In October 1998, Smith was the subject of a story on his university's public broadcasting station.(July 6, 1999). Suspected shooter said his hate-filled leaflets spoke 'the truth'. CNN.  Shooting spree  Smith was a follower of the white supremacist organization now known as the Creativity Movement, and was a devoted disciple of the group's leader Matthew Hale. Two days after Hale was denied a license to practice law in Illinois, Smith loaded his light blue Ford Taurus with guns and ammunition and ventured on a three-day two-state shooting spree, during which he killed two people and wounded nine others.Scharnberg, Kirsten (April 27, 2004). Double talk disguises call to arms. Chicago Tribune. Starting on the evening of Friday, July 2, Smith shot and wounded nine Orthodox Jews in drive-by shootings in the West Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. Smith then shot and killed former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, an African-American, in front of two of his three children while they were walking outside Byrdsong's Skokie, Illinois home. On Saturday, Smith traveled to Urbana, Springfield and later Decatur, where he shot and wounded an African-American minister. On Sunday, July 4, Smith traveled to Bloomington, Indiana, where he killed Won-Joon Yoon, a 26-year-old Korean graduate student in Economics at Indiana University, who was on his way to the Korean United Methodist Church.Michael H. Stone & Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 74-78. Smith also shot at but missed another nine people. On Sunday, July 4, while fleeing the police in a high-speed chase on a southern Illinois highway, Smith shot himself twice in the head and crashed his automobile into a metal post. He then shot himself again, in the heart, this time fatally. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. It is widely believed that Smith's crimes were related to his affiliation with the World Church of the Creator, which views him as a martyr. The group argued that Smith believed himself to be a soldier of the Racial Holy War movement. His actions were indelibly fueled by racial hatred. A chapter of Lone Wolf (a study of spree killers), by Pan Pantziarka, is devoted to Smith and his crimes. Invisible Revolution, a documentary by filmmaker Beverly Peterson, features an interview with Smith less than two weeks before his killing spree. The film includes scenes of Smith distributing World Church of the Creator leaflets in his home town and saying, \\"\`If they violate our constitutional rights and say we can't put out our literature, we have no choice but to resort to acts of violence and really to plunge this country into a terrorist war they've never seen before.\\"  See also  * Ben Klassen * Buford O.

The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics defines a spree killing as \\"killings at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders\\". Definition According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the general definition of spree killer is a person (or more than one person) who commits two or more murders without a cooling-off period; the lack of a cooling-off period marks the difference between a spree killer and a serial killer. The category has, however, been found to be of no real value to law enforcement, because of definitional problems relating to the concept of a \\"cooling-off period\\".Morton, Robert J., and Mark A. Hilts (eds.) Serial Murder ‚Äì Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives for Investigators , National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Accessed July 4, 2009. Serial killers commit clearly separate murders, happening at different times. Mass murderers are defined by one incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders. How to distinguish a spree killer from a mass murderer, or from a serial killer, is subject to considerable debate, and the terms are not consistently applied, even within the academic literature. For example, The Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment lists five different categories of spree killers and cites Mark O. Barton as an example of the second one.Levinson, David (ed.): Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Vol. 4; Berkshire Publishing Group, 2002. p. 1565 He is also noted with other mass murderers, such as Patrick Sherrill, in the respective entry about mass murder.Levinson, p. 1038. In The Anatomy Of Motive, John E. Douglas cites Charles Starkweather and Andrew Cunanan as examples of spree killers,Douglas, John E. & Olshaker, Mark: The Anatomy Of Motive; Simon and Schuster, 1999. while Jack Levin calls Starkweather a mass murdererLevin, Jack & Fox, James Alan: Mass Murder: America's Growing Menace, Berkley Books, 1991. and Cunanan a serial killer.Levin, Jack: Serial Killers and Sadistic Murderers, Prometheus Books, 2008. p. 49. In Controversial Issues in Criminology, Fuller and Hickey write that \\"[t]he element of time involved between murderous acts is primary in the differentiation of serial, mass, and spree murderers\\", later elaborating that spree killers \\"will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks\\" while the \\"methods of murder and types of victims vary\\". Andrew Cunanan is given as an example of spree killing, while Charles Whitman is mentioned in connection with mass murder, and Jeffrey Dahmer with serial killing.Fuller, John R. & Hickey, Eric W.: Controversial Issues in Criminology; Allyn and Bacon, 1999. pp. 36. In Serial Murder, Ronald M. Holmes and Stephen T. Holmes define spree murder as \\"the killing of three or more people within a 30-day period\\" and add that killing sprees are \\"usually accompanied by the commission of another felony.\\"Holmes, R. M, & Holmes, S. T.: Serial Murder; SAGE Publications, 2010. pp. 35. They cite Charles Starkweather and the Beltway Snipers as examples of spree killers.Holmes, R. M, & Holmes, S. T.: Serial Murder; SAGE Publications, 2010. pp. 36. Under this particular definition of spree murder, Richard Chase, who is usually labelled as a serial killer, would actually be a spree killer because he committed his murders within a 30-day period. Ronald and Stephen Holmes define serial murder as \\"the killing of three or more people over a period of more than 30 days, with a significant cooling-off period between the killings.\\"Holmes, R. M, & Holmes, S. T.: Serial Murder; SAGE Publications, 2010. pp. 6. Under this definition, Andrew Cunanan would be categorized as a serial killer and not a spree killer. Douglas wrote that the identity of a serial killer is generally unknown until they are caught, and a mass murderer's identity is learned only after they have committed the crime. The identity of the spree killer, on the other hand, usually becomes known by police while the spree is still in progress.Douglas, p. 192.

He served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Detroit Mercy (1988-1993) and Northwestern University (1993-1997), compiling a career coaching record of 89‚Äì163. Byrdsong was the first African American head coach of the Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball program. On July 2, 1999, he was shot at 8:52 pm in a hate crime killing spree. He died at 12:42 am on July 3, 1999. Early life Byrdsong grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, raised by his mother with his younger sister Marcia. He attended Frederick Douglass High School. Besides basketball, Byrdsong played the saxophone in the band, sang with the chorus and appeared in school plays. After graduation in 1974, Byrdsong accepted a basketball scholarship to Pratt Community College in Pratt, Kansas. Byrdsong then played his final two seasons of college basketball for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa under Coach Lynn Nance from 1976-1978. He was named team captain, but played sparingly for the Cyclones averaging 0.9 points and 0.9 rebounds in his career. After graduating from Pratt, Byrdsong had been offered scholarships from many schools, before choosing Iowa State. He said, \\"Then I went there and I never played. I probably was the only non-playing captain in Iowa State history. Total all my minutes in two years and it might equal two games.\\" However, after he graduated from Iowa State, Coach Nance asked Brydsong consider coaching and then asked him to stay with the Cyclones as a graduate assistant. He accepted the advice and began his coaching career in 1978.  Coaching career  In a ten year run as a college assistant, Byrdsong was an assistant at Arizona six seasons under Coach Lute Olson. Byrdsong was an assistant as the Wildcats advanced to the NCAA Final Four in 1988, after the program had been 4-24 in 1983. After the season he was offered the head coaching position at Detroit Mercy.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1999-07-04-9907040235-story.html As coach for the Northwestern University Wildcats from 1993 to 1997, Byrdsong led them to a National Invitation Tournament berth in 1994, the second postseason appearance in school history, defeating DePaul University in the first round. He had previously been head coach at the University of Detroit-Mercy (1988-1993) and assistant coach at the University of Arizona (1982-1988), Eastern Illinois University (1980-1982), Western Michigan University (1979-1980) and Iowa State University (1978-1979). After he left Northwestern, he worked as an vice president of community affairs for Aon Corporation until his death. =The walk on the wild side= On February 5, 1994, while coaching a game against Minnesota, Byrdsong abruptly left the game and joined the fans in the stands shaking hands, high- fiving the Minnesota Gopher mascot and taking an unticketed seat until removed by an usher. The team had started the season 9-0 but was at this point on a 9-game losing streak. After returning to Evanston, Byrdsong's wife requested a leave of absence for the coach, to which Byrdsong remarked, \\"My wife, after watching me, obviously got concerned, now, any time I'm going to take a walk on the wild side, I should let her know.\\" Personal life and death On July 2, 1999, while jogging near his Skokie, Illinois home with his son and daughter, ages 8 and 10, Byrdsong was shot by Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, a member of the white supremacist Creativity Movement who went on a shooting spree, and died four hours later on July 3 at Evanston Hospital. Smith was a disciple of Mathew Hale (leader of Creativity Movement) and his shooting spree took place two days after Hale was denied a license to practice law in Illinois. Over a span of a few days, Smith killed a Korean American student at Indiana University, injured two African American men in Springfield, Illinois, a Taiwanese man in Urbana, an African American minister in Decatur, and six Orthodox Jews in the West Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. Smith also attempted to shoot, but missed 9 other potential victims. According to eyewitnesses, Smith pulled alongside Byrdsong and shot him multiple times. Smith was never brought to trial because he committed suicide on July 4, 1999, after he crashed his car into a metal post during a high-speed chase in Southern Illinois. Byrdsong and his wife, Sherialyn, had three children: Sabrina, Kelley and Ricky Jr. =Media coverage and public reaction= A fair amount of media coverage was centered on the events of Byrdsong's death and his achievements as a former Northwestern basketball coach. In 2000, an award was created in his honor by the Illinois Fatherhood Initiative. Anya Cordell, Byrdsong's neighbor, wrote the anti-hate crime book Race: An Open and Shut Case. Cordell said that she was inspired by the urge to combat the hate that fueled Benjamin Smith's deadly shooting rampage. Byrdsong's children also received college scholarships from the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, an organization which helps victims of families from hate crimes. In 2009, a documentary about Byrdsong, entitled Fly Like the Byrd, was created by Northwestern students from the Medill School of Journalism. The 25-minute documentary examines race relations and how his legacy has lived on, ten years later.Fly Like The Byrd, Vimeo, Retrieved on January 23, 2018 The Ricky Byrdsong Foundation His widow established The Ricky Byrdsong Foundation. Its mission is to \\"arrest the growing epidemic of hate and violence in our society by and against our youth.\\" The foundation holds a number of events in and around Evanston; the most well-known is the Race Against Hate, a 5K running race held annually in late June in Evanston. The Race Against Hate race draws several thousand runners. In 2009, a 10,000-meter running race was added in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Race Against Hate.

This reportedly sent him into a cycle of erratic and frightening behavior. Ashbrook lived for many years with his father, Jack D. Ashbrook. Across the street from the Ashbrooks' home, neighbors said they saw Ashbrook treat his father violently but were afraid to report it. Newspaper editor Stephen Kaye, whom Ashbrook had visited days before the shooting, described him as being \\"the opposite of someone you'd be concerned about\\", saying he \\"couldn't have been any nicer.\\" However, his neighbors had an entirely different view of him, describing him as strange and violent. Investigators at his house discovered that he had virtually destroyed the interior of his house - holes were bashed into the walls with crowbars, the toilets were filled with concrete, and the fruit trees growing in the front yard had been poisoned. Police investigating the shooting could find no solid motive for the crime. In the months before the shooting, people who knew Ashbrook said he became increasingly paranoid, certain that he was being framed for serial murder and other crimes that he did not commit. He also feared that the CIA was targeting him, and he reported psychological warfare, assaults by co-workers and being drugged by the police. Just days before the shooting he voiced these concerns to a newspaper, saying \\"I want someone to tell my story, no one will listen to me; no one will believe me.\\" According to Houston-area writer John Craig, Ashbrook had ties to the Phineas Priesthood and Christian Identity, both of which view mainstream Christianity as an enemy.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1999-sep-18-mn-11519-story.html See also *Sutherland Springs church shooting *Daingerfield church shooting *Charleston church shooting *List of rampage killers in the United States ReferencesExternal links *Death in a Church: The Faith, The New York Times (September 18, 1999) *Death in a Church: The Overview, The New York Times (September 18, 1999) *Death in a Church: The Politics, The New York Times (September 18, 1999) *Death in a Church: The Killer, The New York Times (September 18, 1999) *Death in a Church: The Overview, The New York Times (September 17, 1999) *Death in a Church: The Victims, The New York Times (September 17, 1999) *Church gunman kills 7, self, in Texas, CNN (September 16, 1999) Category:1952 births Category:1999 deaths Category:20th-century American criminals Category:American mass murderers Category:Attacks in the United States in 1999 Category:1999 murders in the United States Category:Christian Identity Category:Mass murder in 1999 Category:People from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Murder‚Äìsuicides in Texas Category:Place of birth missing Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:American murderers of children Category:Deaths by firearm in Texas Category:Suicides by firearm in Texas Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in the United States Category:Murder in Texas Category:1999 mass shootings in the United States Category:Crimes in Texas Category:Bombers (people) Category:Mass shootings in the United States ","title":"Larry Gene Ashbrook"},{"id":"168234","text":"Eric Chiwaya, a member of the United Democratic Front, is the urban governor for Blantyre, Malawi.

While they rarely enjoyed significant mainstream success, they are considered originators of funk along with artists like James Brown, and their work is influential on many other bands, both their contemporaries and modern musicians. Their sound is defined by a combination of tight melodic grooves and syncopated New Orleans \\"second line\\" rhythms under highly charged guitar and keyboard riffing. The band has been nominated four times for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, most recently in 2017. In 2018 the band was presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.‚ÄúQueen, Tina Turner to Receive Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award‚Äù. Rolling Stone. Retrieved March 8, 2018 History=1960s‚Äì1970s= Art Neville, the group's frontman, launched a solo career around the New Orleans area in the mid-1950s while still in high school. The Meters formed in 1965 with a line-up of keyboardist and vocalist Art Neville, guitarist Leo Nocentelli, bassist George Porter Jr. and drummer Joseph \\"Zigaboo\\" Modeliste. They were later joined by percussionist-vocalist Cyril Neville. The Meters became the house band for Allen Toussaint and his record label, Sansu Enterprises. In 1969 the Meters released \\"Sophisticated Cissy\\" and \\"Cissy Strut\\", both major R&B; chart hits. \\"Look-Ka Py Py\\" and \\"Chicken Strut\\" were their hits the following year. After a label shift in 1972, the Meters had difficulty returning to the charts, but they worked with Dr. John, Paul McCartney, King Biscuit Boy, Labelle, Robert Palmer and others. In 1975 Paul McCartney invited the Meters to play at the release party for his Venus and Mars album aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was in attendance at the event and was greatly taken with the Meters and their sound. The Rolling Stones invited the band to open for them on their Tour of the Americas '75 and Tour of Europe '76. That same year, the Meters recorded one of their most successful albums, Fire on the Bayou. From 1976 to 77 they played in The Wild Tchoupitoulas with George and Amos Landry and The Neville Brothers. Art and Cyril Neville left the band in early 1977, but The Meters still appeared on Saturday Night Live on March 19, 1977, during the show's second season. After the Nevilles' departure, David Batiste Sr. took over on keyboards while Willie West joined as the band's lead singer. Porter left the group later that year and by 1980 The Meters had officially broken up. After the break-up, Neville continued his career as part of The Neville Brothers, Modeliste toured with Keith Richards and Ron Wood, while Nocentelli and Porter \\"became in-demand session players and formed new bands.\\" =1980s‚Äì1990s= In 1989 Art Neville, George Porter Jr. and Leo Nocentelli reunited as The Meters, adding drummer Russell Batiste Jr. to replace Zigaboo Modeliste. Nocentelli left the group in 1994 and was replaced with guitarist Brian Stoltz, formerly of The Neville Brothers. The band was renamed The Funky Meters. They were referred to as \\"the Funky Meters\\" as early as 1989. They were billed as such when playing in a tiny venue called Benny's Bar at Valence and Camp streets. =2000s‚Äì2010s= The Funky Meters continued to play into the 2000s with Stoltz being replaced by Art Neville's son, Ian Neville, from 2007 to 2011 while he went to pursue a solo career. Stoltz returned to the band permanently in 2011. In 2000 a big offer enticed all four original Meters to reunite for a one-night stand at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco; by this time Modeliste wanted to make the reunion a permanent one, but the other members and their management teams objected. It wasn't until Quint Davis, producer and director of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, got them to \\"put aside their differences and hammer out the details\\" and perform at the Festival in 2005. In June 2011 The Original Meters along with Allen Toussaint and Dr. John played the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The six men performed Dr. John's album Desitively Bonnaroo which was originally recorded with the Meters, to a sold-out crowd. The Original Meters also played a set at the 2011 Voodoo Experience in New Orleans. On May 5, 2012 The Meters returned to New Orleans for a performance to a sold-out crowd at the Howlin' Wolf. In late 2012, Zigaboo Modeliste, Leo Nocentelli, and George Porter Jr. played concerts with Phish keyboardist Page McConnell under the name The Meter Men. During his time off from Phish, Page McConnell has continued to play with Porter Jr., Nocentelli, and Modeliste under the moniker of The Meter Men since those shows in 2012. The Meter Men had performed 16 shows together as of spring 2015, with their third annual appearance as a late night act during New Orleans' Jazz and Heritage Festival. In 2014, during The Meter Men's second appearance as a late night act during Jazzfest, the band performed at The Republic on April 26, 2014, after McConnell had headlined the NOLA Jazzfest at the New Orleans Fairgrounds with Phish earlier that day. The Meter Men had also played the previous night at The Republic. The states The Meter Men had appeared in as of spring 2015 were Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Colorado, and Vermont, with one other performance in Washington, D.C. As of 2017, The Funky Meters tour consistently performing songs by The Meters, while The Meters perform sporadically. The lineup of Neville, Porter, Nocentelli and Modeliste typically bill themselves as The Original Meters to avoid confusion with The Funky Meters. When not performing with The Original Meters, guitarist Leo Nocentelli leads his own group, The Meters Experience, which also performs the music of The Meters. As of 2018, the most recent performance of the original Meters (with all four of the founding members) took place at the Arroyo Seco Festival in Pasadena, California on June 25, 2017. The song \\"They All Ask'd for You\\" from the 1975 album Fire on the Bayou remains popular in the New Orleans region and is the unofficial theme song of the Audubon Zoo. Art Neville announced his retirement from music on December 18, 2018. Neville died on July 22, 2019.

Influence According to Brian Knight of The Vermont Review, \\"In a sense, the Meters defined the basic characteristics of the groove. While Funkadelic, Cameo, James Brown and Sly Stone are synonymous with funk, these artists look to the Meters for the basic-down to earthy and raw sound.\\" Music critique Robert Christgau called the band \\"totally original\\" and placed the compilation album Funkify Your Life: The Meters Anthology on his list of top six New Orleans classics. The Meters' music has been sampled by musicians around the world, including rap artists Heavy D, LL Cool J and Queen Latifah, Musiq, Big Daddy Kane, Run-DMC, N.W.A, Ice Cube, Scarface, Cypress Hill, EPMD, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Naughty by Nature, and Tweet. Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the Meters' song \\"Africa\\", renamed \\"Hollywood (Africa)\\", on their 1985 album Freaky Styley. The eclectic jazz-fusion guitarist Oz Noy has recorded his version of \\"Cissy Strut\\" twice. Bands such as the Grateful Dead, KVHW, Steve Kimock Band, Widespread Panic, Rebirth Brass Band, Galactic, Jaco Pastorius and The String Cheese Incident have performed songs by The Meters in their concert rotations. The Meters' songs have been used in the films Two Can Play That Game, Jackie Brown, Drumline, Hancock, Calendar Girls, Hitch, Red, The Best of Enemies, The Kitchen, and Beerfest. The band's songs were also featured in the television shows The Wire, Ballers and Disjointed as well as the video game Grand Theft Auto IV.

The band consisted of Gibbons on guitar, Don Summers on bass, Dan Mitchell on drums and Tom Moore on keyboards. History Gibbons founded the Texas psychedelic group in the mid-1960s and quickly drew a large following, especially among the Houston \\"teen scene\\". They recorded several singles and one full-length album, Flash. Their single \\"99th Floor\\" was well received and topped the charts at No. 1 in Houston for six weeks. The success of this record led the Sidewalks to sign with Wand Records which then released \\"Need Me\\", also a Top 10 Hit for the band. The group was asked to open for many rock tours, including Jimi Hendrix and The Doors. After Tom Moore and Don Summers were drafted into the United States Army, Gibbons and Mitchell added Lanier Greig and formed the original ZZ Top. While attending Warner Brothers' art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including The Saints, Billy G & the Blueflames, and The Coachmen. By 1967, Gibbons returned to Houston and formed an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician, Roky Erickson and The 13th Floor Elevators. The \\"Moving Sidewalks\\" name was chosen and shortly thereafter 99th Floor. Around this time Gibbons had developed quite a camaraderie with the rock and roll superstar Jimi Hendrix. As a guest on The Dick Cavett Show, Hendrix started that Gibbons was slated to be the next big thing as a guitarist. The Moving Sidewalks continued to appear along with the 13th Floor Elevators at the short-lived yet legendary Houston psychedelic venue, Love Street Light Circus at Allen's Landing. One night the Elevators set was cut short by Houston Police who arrested the band's lead singer Roky Erickson for marijuana possession. In January 2013 Gibbons announced the Moving Sidewalks would reunite with all original members for one show on March 30, 2013, at B.B. King's Blues Club in New York City. Since that successful sold out NY show and despite their single show announcement, the band played as official headliners of Austin Psych Fest on May 1, 2013, and the Charity Gala for The Deacons of Deadwood Ball on September 28, 2013, in Houston.

Edwin Fischer (6 October 1886 ‚Äì 24 January 1960) was a Swiss classical pianist and conductor. He is regarded as one of the great interpreters of J.S. Bach and (particularly) Mozart of the twentieth century. Biography Fischer was born in Basel and studied music first there, and later in Berlin at the Stern conservatory under Martin Krause. He first came to prominence as a pianist following World War I. In 1926, he became conductor of the L√ºbeck Musikverein and later conducted in Munich. In 1932 he formed his own chamber orchestra, and was one of the first to be interested in presenting music of the Baroque and Classical periods in a historically accurate way. Although his performances were not historically accurate by present-day standards, they were for his time; e.g., he did conduct Bach and Mozart concertos from the keyboard, an unusual practice at that time. His interpretations of Bach and Handel were Romantically conceived, with a wide dynamic range but often quite compelling. In 1932 he returned once again to Berlin, succeeding his great contemporary Artur Schnabel in a teaching role at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik after Schnabel's exile (he was Jewish, and Fischer was not) from Nazi Germany. In 1942 he moved back to Switzerland, temporarily putting his career on hold through World War II. After the war he began to perform again, and gave master classes in Lucerne for a number of later prominent pianists such as Alfred Brendel, Helena S√° e Costa, Mario Feninger, Reine Gianoli, Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim. Two drawings of Fischer by the German artist and musician Fritz Tennigkeit (1892‚Äì1949) As well as solo recitals, concerto performances and conducting, Fischer performed much chamber music. Particularly highly regarded was the piano trio he formed with the cellist Enrico Mainardi and the violinist Georg Kulenkampff, (who was replaced by Wolfgang Schneiderhan after Kulenkampff's death). Fischer published a number of books on teaching, and one on the piano sonatas of Beethoven. He also made a number of recordings, including the first complete Bach Well-Tempered Clavier for EMI, recorded on the piano from 1933 to 1936. Other classic recordings by Fischer include Bach keyboard concertos, miscellaneous solo Bach works such as the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue, various concertos and sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven, Schubert's \\"Wanderer\\" Fantasie (although he was not up to the transcendental technical demands of the finale) and Impromptus, and Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\" and Brahms' Second Concerto, both conducted by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler. Fischer's historically important recordings have been reissued on CD by EMI and specialty labels such as APR, Music & Arts, Pearl and Testament. Those of the Mozart Concertos K. 453, 466, 482, 491 and 503 (G major, D minor, E-flat major, C minor and C major) are particularly outstanding, especially the last three with the inspired, powerful conducting of John Barbirolli, Lawrance Collingwood and Josef Krips respectively, in 1935, 1937 and 1947. Fischer also accompanied Elisabeth Schwarzkopf in a renowned early-to-mid-1950s EMI LP of Schubert Lieder. His last musical collaboration was with the violinist Gioconda de Vito. During their recording sessions for the Brahms violin sonatas Nos. 1 and 3, he had to go to London for medical treatment, where he was told he was seriously ill. He died shortly afterwards in Zurich.

After early training as a classical flautist, he developed an interest in blues harmonica. He explored the blues scene in his native Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters and other blues greats, who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions. He soon began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts Nick Gravenites and Elvin Bishop. In 1963, he formed the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which recorded several successful albums and was popular on the late-1960s concert and festival circuit, with performances at the Fillmore West, in San Francisco; the Fillmore East, in New York City; the Monterey Pop Festival; and Woodstock. The band was known for combining electric Chicago blues with a rock urgency and for their pioneering jazz fusion performances and recordings. After the breakup of the group in 1971, Butterfield continued to tour and record with the band Paul Butterfield's Better Days, with his mentor Muddy Waters, and with members of the roots-rock group the Band. While still recording and performing, Butterfield died in 1987 at age 44 of an accidental drug overdose. Music critics have acknowledged his development of an original approach that places him among the best-known blues harp players. In 2006, he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. Butterfield and the early members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Both panels noted his harmonica skills and his contributions to bringing blues music to a younger and broader audience. Career Butterfield was born in Chicago and raised in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood. The son of a lawyer and a painter, he attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school associated with the University of Chicago. Exposed to music at an early age, he studied classical flute with Walfrid Kujala, of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Butterfield was also athletic and was offered a track scholarship to Brown University. However, a knee injury and a growing interest in blues music sent him in a different direction. He met guitarist and singer songwriter Nick Gravenites, who shared an interest in authentic blues music. By the late 1950s, they were visiting blues clubs in Chicago, where musicians such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Otis Rush encouraged them and occasionally let them sit in on jam sessions. The pair were soon performing as Nick and Paul in college-area coffee houses. In the early 1960s, Butterfield met aspiring blues guitarist Elvin Bishop. Bishop recalled: Eventually, Butterfield, on vocals and harmonica, and Bishop, accompanying him on guitar, were offered a regular gig at Big John's, a folk club in the Old Town district on Chicago's near North Side. With this booking, they persuaded bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay (both from Howlin' Wolf's touring band) to form a group with them in 1963. Their engagement at the club was highly successful and brought the group to the attention of record producer Paul A. Rothchild. =Butterfield Blues Band with Bloomfield= During their engagement at Big John's, Butterfield met and occasionally sat in with guitarist Mike Bloomfield, who was also playing at the club. By chance, producer Rothchild witnessed one of their performances and was impressed by the chemistry between the two. He persuaded Butterfield to bring Bloomfield into the band, and they were signed to Elektra Records. Their first attempt to record an album, in December 1964, did not meet Rothchild's expectations, although an early version of \\"Born in Chicago\\", written by Gravenites, was included on the 1965 Elektra sampler Folksong '65 and created interest in the band (additional early recordings were released on the Elektra compilation What's Shakin' in 1966 and The Original Lost Elektra Sessions in 1995). To capture their sound better, Rothchild convinced Elektra president Jac Holzman to record a live album. In the spring of 1965, the Butterfield Blues Band was recorded at the Cafe Au Go Go in New York City. These recordings also failed to satisfy Rothchild, but the group's appearances at the club brought them to the attention of the East Coast music community. Rothchild persuaded Holzman to agree to a third attempt at recording an album. In these recording sessions, Rothchild had assumed the role of group manager and used his folk contacts to secure the band more engagements outside of Chicago. At the last minute, the band was booked to perform at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1965. They were scheduled as the opening act the first night when the gates opened and again the next afternoon in an urban blues workshop at the festival. Despite limited exposure on the first night and a dismissive introduction the following day by the folklorist and blues researcher Alan Lomax, the band was able to attract an unusually large audience for a workshop performance. Maria Muldaur, with her husband Geoff, who later toured and recorded with Butterfield, recalled the group's performance as stunning; it was the first time that many of the mostly folk- music fans had heard a high-powered electric blues combo. Among those who took notice was festival regular Bob Dylan, who invited the band to back him for his first live electric performance. With little rehearsal, Dylan performed a short, four-song set the next day with Bloomfield, Arnold, and Lay (along with Al Kooper and Barry Goldberg). The performance was not well received by some and generated a controversy, but it was a watershed event and brought the band to the attention of a much larger audience. The band added keyboardist Mark Naftalin, and its debut album, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was finally successfully recorded in mid-1965 and released later that year. The opening song, a newer recording of the previously released \\"Born in Chicago\\", is an upbeat blues rocker and set the tone for the album, which included a mix of blues standards, such as \\"Shake Your Moneymaker\\", \\"Blues with a Feeling\\", and \\"Look Over Yonders Wall\\", and compositions by the band. The album, described as a \\"hard-driving blues album that, in a word, rocked\\", reached number 123 in the Billboard 200 album chart in 1966, but its influence was felt beyond its sales figures. On March 28, 1966, Butterfield appeared on the CBS game show To Tell the Truth. At the end of his segment, he performed \\"Born in Chicago\\" with the house band. Jazz drummer Billy Davenport was invited to replace Lay, who was ailing. In July 1966, the sextet recorded their second album, East-West, which was released a month later. The album consists of more varied material, with the band's interpretations of blues (Robert Johnson's \\"Walkin' Blues\\"), rock (Michael Nesmith's \\"Mary, Mary\\"), R&B; (Allen Toussaint's \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\"), and jazz selections (Nat Adderley's \\"Work Song\\"). East-West reached number 65 in the album chart. The 13-minute instrumental track \\"East- West\\" incorporates Indian raga influences and some of the earliest jazz-fusion and blues rock excursions, with extended solos by Butterfield and guitarists Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop. It has been described as \\"the first of its kind and ... the root from which the acid rock tradition emerged\\". Live versions of the song sometimes lasted nearly an hour, and performances at the San Francisco Fillmore Auditorium \\"were a huge influence on the city's jam bands\\". Bishop recalled, \\"Quicksilver, Big Brother, and the Dead ‚Äì those guys were just chopping chords. They had been folk musicians and weren't particularly proficient playing electric guitar ‚Äì [Bloomfield] could play all these scales and arpeggios and fast time-signatures ... He just destroyed them.\\" Several live versions of \\"East-West\\" from this period were later released on East-West Live in 1996. In England in November 1966, Butterfield recorded several songs with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, who had recently finished the album A Hard Road. Butterfield and Mayall contributed vocals, and Butterfield's Chicago-style blues harp was featured. Four songs were released in the UK on a 45-rpm EP, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers with Paul Butterfield, in January 1967. =Later Butterfield Blues Band= In spite of its success, the Butterfield Blues Band soon changed its lineup. Arnold and Davenport left the band, and Bloomfield went on to form his own group, Electric Flag. With Bishop and Naftalin remaining on guitar and keyboards, the band added bassist Bugsy Maugh, drummer Phillip Wilson, and saxophonists David Sanborn and Gene Dinwiddie. This lineup recorded the band's third album, The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw, in 1967. The album cut back on extended instrumental jams and went in a more rhythm and blues-influenced horn-driven direction, with songs such as Charles Brown's \\"Driftin' Blues\\" (retitled \\"Driftin' and Driftin'\\"), Otis Rush's \\"Double Trouble\\", and Junior Parker's \\"Driving Wheel\\". The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw was Butterfield's highest-charting album, reaching number 52 on the album chart. Most of this lineup performed at the seminal Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967. On its next album, In My Own Dream, released in 1968, the band continued to move away from its roots in Chicago blues towards a more soul-influenced, horn-based sound. With Butterfield singing only three songs, the album featured more band contributions. It reached number 79 in the Billboard album chart. By the end of 1968, both Bishop and Naftalin had left the band. In April 1969, Butterfield took part in a concert at Chicago's Auditorium Theater and a subsequent recording session organized by record producer Norman Dayron, featuring Muddy Waters backed by Otis Spann, Mike Bloomfield, Sam Lay, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, and Buddy Miles. Such Waters warhorses as \\"Forty Days and Forty Nights\\", \\"I'm Ready\\", \\"Baby, Please Don't Go\\", and \\"Got My Mojo Working\\" were recorded and later released on the album Fathers and Sons. Waters commented, \\"We did a lot of the things over we did with Little Walter and Jimmy Rogers and Elgin [Evans] on drums [an early configuration of Waters's band] ... It's about as close as I've been [to that feel] since I first recorded it\\". To one reviewer, these recordings represent Paul Butterfield's best performances. The Butterfield Blues Band was invited to perform at the Woodstock Festival on August 18, 1969. The band performed seven songs, and although its performance did not appear in the film Woodstock, one song, \\"Love March\\", was included on the album Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More, released in 1970. In 2009, Butterfield was included in the expanded 40th Anniversary Edition Woodstock video, and an additional two songs appeared on the box set Woodstock: 40 Years On: Back to Yasgur's Farm. The album Keep On Moving, with only Butterfield remaining from the original lineup, was released in 1969. It was produced by veteran R&B; producer and songwriter Jerry Ragovoy, reportedly brought in by Elektra to turn out a \\"breakout commercial hit\\". The album was not embraced by critics or long-time fans; however, it reached number 102 in the Billboard album chart. A live double album by the Butterfield Blues Band, Live, was recorded March 21‚Äì22, 1970, at The Troubadour, in West Hollywood, California. By this time, the band included a four-piece horn section in what has been described as a \\"big-band Chicago blues with a jazz base\\". Live provides perhaps the best showcase for this unique \\"blues-jazz-rock-R&B; hybrid sound\\". After the release of another soul-influenced album, Sometimes I Just Feel Like Smilin' in 1971, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band disbanded. In 1972, a retrospective of their career, Golden Butter: The Best of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was released by Elektra. =Better Days and solo= After the breakup of the Butterfield Blues Band and no longer under contract with Elektra, Butterfield retreated to Woodstock, New York, where he eventually formed his next band, Paul Butterfield's Better Days, with drummer Chris Parker, guitarist Amos Garrett, singer Geoff Muldaur, pianist Ronnie Barron and bassist Billy Rich. In 1972‚Äì1973, the group recorded the albums Paul Butterfield's Better Days and It All Comes Back, released by Albert Grossman's Bearsville Records. The albums reflected the influence of the participants and explored more roots- and folk-based styles. Although without an easily defined commercial style, both reached the album chart. The band did not last to record a third studio album, but its album Live at Winterland Ballroom, recorded in 1973, was released in 1999. With Rick Danko (left) on bass guitar at Woodstock Reunion 1979 Butterfield next pursued a solo career and appeared as a sideman in several different musical settings. In 1975, he again joined Muddy Waters to record Waters's last album for Chess Records, The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album. The album was recorded at Levon Helm's Woodstock studio with Garth Hudson and members of Waters's touring band. In 1976, Butterfield performed at the Band's final concert, \\"The Last Waltz\\", accompanying the Band on the song \\"Mystery Train\\" and backing Muddy Waters on \\"Mannish Boy\\". Butterfield kept up his association with former members of the Band, touring and recording with Levon Helm and the RCO All Stars in 1977 and touring with Rick Danko in 1979. A 1984 live performance with Danko and Richard Manuel was recorded and released as Live at the Lonestar in 2011. As a solo act with backing musicians, Butterfield continued to tour and recorded Put It in Your Ear in 1976 and North South in 1981, with strings, synthesizers, and funk arrangements. In 1986, he released his final studio album, The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again, which was an attempt at a comeback with an updated rock sound. On April 15, 1987, he participated in the concert \\"B.B. King & Friends\\", with Eric Clapton, Etta James, Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others. Legacy Aside from \\"rank[ing] among the most influential harp players in the Blues\\", Butterfield has also been seen as pointing blues-based music in new, innovative directions. AllMusic critic Steve Huey commented, In 2006, Butterfield was inducted into the Blues Foundation's Blues Hall of Fame, which noted that \\"the albums released by the Butterfield Blues Band brought Chicago Blues to a generation of Rock fans during the 1960s and paved the way for late 1960s electric groups like Cream\\". The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 2015. The induction biography commented that \\"the Butterfield Band converted the country-blues purists and turned on the Fillmore generation to the pleasures of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Willie Dixon and Elmore James\\". In 2017, a documentary titled Horn from the Heart: the Paul Butterfield Story premiered at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Directed by John Anderson and produced by Sandra Warren, it won the Outstanding Achievement Award in Filmmaking: Editing. In October 2018, the documentary was released nationally in select US theaters. It has received critical acclaim, including being named a New York Times Critic's Pick, as well as features in Rolling Stone, and The Wall Street Journal. Harmonica style Like many Chicago blues harp players, Butterfield approached the instrument like a horn, preferring single notes to chords, and used it for soloing. His style has been described as \\"always intense, understated, concise, and serious\\", and he was \\"known for purity and intensity of his tone, his sustained breath control, and his unique ability to bend notes to his will\\". In his choice of notes he has been compared to Big Walter Horton, but he was never seen as an imitator of any particular harp player. Rather, he developed \\"a style original and powerful enough to place him in the pantheon of true blues greats\\". Butterfield played Hohner harmonicas (and endorsed them). He preferred the diatonic ten-hole Marine Band model. He wrote a harmonica instruction book, Paul Butterfield Teaches Blues Harmonica Master Class, a few years before his death (it was not published until 1997). In it, he explains various techniques, demonstrated on an accompanying CD. Butterfield played mainly in cross-harp, or second position. Reportedly left-handed, he held the harmonica in a manner opposite that of a right-handed player, i.e., in his right hand, upside down (with the low notes to the right), using his left hand for muting effects. Also like other electric Chicago blues harp players, Butterfield frequently used amplification to achieve his sound. He has been associated with a Shure 545 Unidyne microphone, although producer Rothchild noted that around the time of a 1965 recording session, Butterfield favored an Altec harp microphone run through an early model Fender tweed amplifier. Beginning with album The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw, he used an acoustic harmonica style, following his shift to a more R&B-based; approach. Personal life By all accounts, Paul Butterfield was absorbed in his music. According to his brother Peter, Producer Norman Dayron recalled the young Butterfield as \\"very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, kind of a hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets ... Paul was hard to be friends with.\\" Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: \\"He was a bad guy. He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. I was scared to death of that cat\\". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as \\"always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly\\". He remembered Butterfield as \\"not much interested in other people\\". By 1971, Butterfield had purchased his first house, in rural Woodstock, New York, and began enjoying family life with his second wife, Kathy Peterson, and their infant son, Lee. According to Maria Muldaur, she and her husband were frequent dinner guests, which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs. She doubted her abilities, but \\"it was Butter that first encouraged me to let loose and just sing the blues [and] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes ... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me ... And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician.\\" Death Beginning in 1980, Paul Butterfield underwent several surgical procedures to relieve his peritonitis, a serious and painful inflammation of the intestines. Although strongly opposed to heroin as a bandleader, he developed an addiction to it, which, according to Steve Huey in AllMusic's Butterfield biography, led to \\"speculation that he was trying to ease his peritonitis symptoms\\". The financial strain of supporting his drug habit was bankrupting him, and the deaths of his friend and one-time musical partner Mike Bloomfield, and manager Albert Grossman had shaken him. On May 4, 1987, at age 44, Paul Butterfield died at his apartment in the North Hollywood district of Los Angeles. An autopsy by the county coroner concluded that he was the victim of an accidental drug overdose, with \\"significant levels of morphine (heroin), ... codeine, the tranquilizer Librium and a trace of alcohol.\\" By the time of his death, Paul Butterfield was out of the commercial mainstream. Although for some, he was very much the blues man, Maria Muldaur commented \\"he had the whole sensibility and musicality and approach down pat ... He just went for it and took it all in, and he embodied the essence of what the blues was all about. Unfortunately, he lived that way a little too much.\\" Band members The Paul Butterfield Blues Band final lineup *Paul Butterfield ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, harmonica *Gene Dinwiddie ‚Äì saxophones, flute, backing and lead vocals *David Sanborn ‚Äì saxophones, percussion *Rod Hicks ‚Äì bass, double bass, backing and lead vocals *Steve Madaio ‚Äì trumpet, percussion, backing vocals *Trevor Lawrence ‚Äì saxophones, percussion, backing vocals *Ralph Walsh ‚Äì guitar, backing and lead vocals *Dennis Whitted ‚Äì drums, percussion, backing vocals Paul Butterfield's Better Days members *Paul Butterfield ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, harmonica, keyboards *Geoff Muldaur ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, slide guitar, piano *Amos Garrett ‚Äì guitar, occasional bass, backing vocals *Billy Rich ‚Äì bass *Ronnie Barron ‚Äì keyboards, piano, backing and lead vocals *Chris Parker ‚Äì drums Discography In 1964, Butterfield began his association with Elektra Records and eventually recorded seven albums for the label.

Originally published in Germany in 1927, it was first translated into English in 1929. The novel was named after the German name for the steppe wolf. The story in large part reflects a profound crisis in Hesse's spiritual world during the 1920s while memorably portraying the protagonist's split between his humanity and his wolf-like aggression and homelessness.Poplawski, p. 176 Steppenwolf was wildly popular and has been a perpetual success across the decades, but Hesse later asserted that the book was largely misunderstood.Hesse, p. 7  Background and publication history  In 1924 Hermann Hesse married singer Ruth Wenger. After several weeks, however, he left Basel, only returning near the end of the year. Upon his return he rented a separate apartment, adding to his isolation. After a short trip to Germany with Wenger, Hesse stopped seeing her almost completely. The resulting feeling of isolation and inability to make lasting contact with the outside world led to increasing despair and return of Hesse's suicidal thoughts. Hesse began writing Steppenwolf in Basel, and finished it in Z√ºrich. In 1926 he published a precursor to the book, a collection of poems titled The Crisis: From Hermann Hesse's Diary. The novel was later released in 1927. The first English edition was published in 1929 by Martin Secker in the United Kingdom and by Henry Holt and Company in the United States. That version was translated by Basil Creighton. 1926 was also the year when Hesse became acquainted with jazz music, attending Swiss performances of the Revue N√®gre featuring Josephine Baker and Sidney Bechet; Steven C. Tracy, professor of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts, writes that \\"the character of Pablo... was inspired by Bechet's playing\\" Plot summary The book is presented as a manuscript written by its protagonist, a middle-aged man named Harry Haller, who leaves it to a chance acquaintance, the nephew of his landlady. The acquaintance adds a short preface of his own and then has the manuscript published. The title of this \\"real\\" book-in-the-book is Harry Haller's Records (For Madmen Only). As the story begins, the hero is beset by reflections on his being ill-suited for the world of everyday, regular people, specifically for frivolous bourgeois society. In his aimless wanderings about the city he encounters a person carrying an advertisement for a magic theatre who gives him a small book, Treatise on the Steppenwolf. This treatise, cited in full in the novel's text as Harry reads it, addresses Harry by name and strikes him as describing himself uncannily. It is a discourse on a man who believes himself to be of two natures: one high, the spiritual nature of man; the other is low and animalistic, a \\"wolf of the steppes\\". This man is entangled in an irresolvable struggle, never content with either nature because he cannot see beyond this self-made concept. The pamphlet gives an explanation of the multifaceted and indefinable nature of every man's soul, but Harry is either unable or unwilling to recognize this. It also discusses his suicidal intentions, describing him as one of the \\"suicides\\": people who, deep down, knew they would take their own life one day. But to counter that, it hails his potential to be great, to be one of the \\"Immortals\\". By chance, Harry encounters the man who gave him the book, just as the man has attended a funeral. He inquires about the magic theater, to which the man replies, \\"Not for everybody.\\" When Harry presses further for information, the man recommends him to a local dance hall, much to Harry's disappointment. When returning from the funeral, Harry meets a former academic friend with whom he had often discussed Oriental mythology, and who invites Harry to his home. While there, Harry is disgusted by the nationalistic mentality of his friend, who inadvertently criticizes a column Harry wrote. In turn, Harry offends the man and his wife by criticizing the wife's bust of Goethe, which Harry feels is too thickly sentimental and insulting to Goethe's true brilliance. This episode confirms to Harry that he is, and will always be, a stranger to his society. Trying to postpone returning home, where he fears all that awaits him is his own suicide, Harry walks aimlessly around the town for most of the night, finally stopping to rest at the dance hall where the man had sent him earlier. He happens upon a young woman, Hermine, who quickly recognizes his desperation. They talk at length; Hermine alternately mocks Harry's self-pity and indulges him in his explanations regarding his view of life, to his astonished relief. Hermine promises a second meeting, and provides Harry with a reason to live (or at least a substantial excuse to continue living) that he eagerly embraces. During the next few weeks, Hermine introduces Harry to the indulgences of what he calls the \\"bourgeois\\". She teaches Harry to dance, introduces him to casual drug use, finds him a lover (Maria) and, more importantly, forces him to accept these as legitimate and worthy aspects of a full life. Hermine also introduces Harry to a mysterious saxophonist named Pablo, who appears to be the very opposite of what Harry considers a serious, thoughtful man. After attending a lavish masquerade ball, Pablo brings Harry to his metaphorical \\"magic theatre\\", where the concerns and notions that plagued his soul disintegrate as he interacts with the ethereal and phantasmal. The Magic Theatre is a place where he experiences the fantasies that exist in his mind. The Theater is described as a long horseshoe-shaped corridor with a mirror on one side and a great number of doors on the other. Harry enters five of these labeled doors, each of which symbolizes a fraction of his life.  Major characters  * Harry Haller - the protagonist, a middle-aged man * Pablo - a saxophonist * Hermine - a young woman Haller meets at a dance * Maria - Hermine's friend Character relationship diagram  Critical analysis  In the preface to the novel's 1960 edition, Hesse wrote that Steppenwolf was \\"more often and more violently misunderstood\\" than any of his other books. Hesse felt that his readers focused only on the suffering and despair that are depicted in Harry Haller's life, thereby missing the possibility of transcendence and healing.Halkin, p. 126 Hermann Hesse in 1926  Critical reception  Later German edition From the very beginning, reception was harsh and it has had a long history of mixed critical reception and opinion. Already upset with Hesse's novel Siddhartha, political activists and patriots railed against him, and against the book, seeing an opportunity to discredit Hesse. Even close friends and longtime readers criticized the novel for its perceived lack of morality in its open depiction of sex and drug use, a criticism that indeed remained the primary rebuff of the novel for many years.Mileck, p. 184 However, as society changed and formerly taboo topics such as sex and drugs became more openly discussed, critics came to attack the book for other reasons; mainly that it was too pessimistic, and that it was a journey in the footsteps of a psychotic and showed humanity through his warped and unstable viewpoint, a fact that Hesse did not dispute, although he did respond to critics by noting the novel ends on a theme of new hope. American novelist Jack Kerouac dismissed it in Big Sur (1962), though popular interest was renewed in the 1960s ‚Äì specifically in the psychedelic movement ‚Äì primarily because it was seen as a counterculture book, and because of its depiction of free love and explicit drug use. It was also introduced in many new colleges for study, and interest in the book and in Hermann Hesse was feted in America for more than a decade afterwards.  References in popular culture  Hesse's 1928 short story \\"Harry, the Steppenwolf\\" forms a companion piece to the novel. It is about a wolf named Harry who is kept in a zoo, and who entertains crowds by destroying images of German cultural icons such as Goethe and Mozart. A paragraph in Hesse's 1943 novel The Glass Bead Game states that the term 'magic theater' is another name of the glass bead game itself. The name Steppenwolf has become notable in popular culture for various organizations and establishments. * In 1967, the band Steppenwolf, headed by German-born singer John Kay, took their name from the novel. * The Belgian band DAAU (Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung) is named after one of the advertising slogans of the novel's magical theatre. * The innovative Magic Theatre Company, founded in 1967 in Berkeley and which later became resident in San Francisco, takes its name from the \\"Magic Theatre\\" of the novel, and the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, founded in 1974 by actors Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise, took its name from the novel. * The lengthy track \\"Steppenwolf\\" appears on English rock band Hawkwind's album Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music and is directly inspired by the novel, including references to the magic theatre and the dual nature of the wolfman- manwolf (lutocost). Robert Calvert had initially written and performed the lyrics on \\"Distances Between Us\\" by Adrian Wagner in 1974. The song also appears on later, live Hawkwind CDs and DVDs. * Danish acid rock band Steppeulvene (1967‚Äì68) also took their name from this novel. * \\"He Was a Steppenwolf\\" is a song by Boney M. from the album Nightflight to Venus. * Zbigniew Brzezinski includes a quote from Steppenwolf as an epigraph to his 1970 book Between Two Ages. * The United States of America's eponymous album features the track \\"The American Metaphysical Circus\\", which has lyrical references to the novel (\\"And the price is right/The cost of one admission is your mind\\"). * Be Here Now (1971), by author and spiritual teacher Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), contains an illustration of a door bearing a sign that reads \\"Magic Theatre ‚Äì For Madmen Only ‚Äì Price of Admission ‚Äì Your Mind\\". This references an invitation that Steppenwolfs Harry Haller receives to attend an \\"Anarchist Evening at the Magic Theatre, For Madmen Only, Price of Admission Your Mind\\". * The Black Ice, by Michael Connelly, has J. Michael Haller making a reference to the author when he mentioned that, if his illegitimate son took his surname, he would be \\"Harry Haller\\" instead of Harry Bosch. * Paula Cole references the concept of the steppenwolf in her song \\"Pearl\\" on her 1999 album Amen. * French singer Aliz√©e sings her song \\"Gourmandises\\" to \\"le loup des steppes\\", literally \\"the wolf of the steppes\\" (2001). * Steppenwolf was also referenced in the film Mall (2014). It is also read by the female lead, Maria, throughout the film Manny Lewis (2015). * \\"Lobo da Estepe\\" by the Brazilian band Os Cascavelletes was also inspired by the book. * The lyrics on the album Finisterre (2017) by the German black metal band Der Weg einer Freiheit are largely based on this book. * \\"–ñ—ä–ª—Ç–∏ –°—Ç—ä–∫–ª–∞\\" (Julti Stukla, or \\"Yellow Glass\\" from Bulgarian) released a song \\"–°—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –•–µ—Å–æ–≤–∏\\" on YouTube on 6 August 2019. It largely and directly references Steppenwolf in its lyrics and description. Film adaptation The novel was adapted into the 1974 film Steppenwolf.

The group was formed in late 1967 in Los Angeles by lead singer John Kay, keyboardist Goldy McJohn, and drummer Jerry Edmonton, all formerly of the Canadian band the Sparrows. Guitarist Michael Monarch and bass guitarist Rushton Moreve were recruited via notices placed in Los Angeles-area record and musical instrument stores. Steppenwolf sold over 25 million records worldwide, released eight Gold albums and 12 Billboard Hot 100 singles, of which six were Top 40 hits, including three Top 10 successes: \\"Born to Be Wild\\", \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\", and \\"Rock Me\\". Steppenwolf enjoyed worldwide success from 1968 to 1972, but clashing personalities led to the end of the core lineup. Today, John Kay is the only original member, having been the lead singer since 1967. The band was called John Kay & Steppenwolf from 1980 to 2018. History=The Sparrows= In 1965 John Kay joined the Sparrows, a popular Canadian band, and was followed by Goldy McJohn. The group eventually broke up. =Breakthrough success and decline (1967‚Äì1972)= In late 1967, Gabriel Mekler urged Kay to re-form the Sparrows and suggested the name change to Steppenwolf, inspired by Hermann Hesse's 1927 novel of the same name. Steppenwolf's first two singles were \\"A Girl I Knew\\" and \\"Sookie Sookie\\". The band finally rocketed to worldwide fame after their third single, \\"Born to Be Wild\\", was released in 1968, as well as their version of Hoyt Axton's \\"The Pusher\\". Both of these tunes were used prominently in the 1969 counterculture cult film Easy Rider (both titles originally had been released on the band's debut album). In the movie, \\"The Pusher\\" accompanies a drug deal, and Peter Fonda stuffing dollar bills into his Stars and Stripes-clad fuel tank, after which \\"Born to Be Wild\\" is heard in the opening credits, with Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding their Harley choppers through the America of the late 1960s. The song, which has been closely associated with motorcycles ever since, introduced to rock lyrics the signature term \\"heavy metal\\" (though not about a kind of music, but about a motorcycle: \\"I like smoke and lightning, heavy metal thunder, racin' with the wind...\\"). Written by Sparrow guitarist Dennis Edmonton, who had begun using the pen name Mars Bonfire and inspired by a billboard roadside advertisement Bonfire liked which depicted a motorcycle tearing through the billboard artwork, the song had already reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1968. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In 1968, Steppenwolf played one of their biggest shows up to that time at the Fillmore East to rave reviews, sharing the bill with Buddy Rich and Children of God. On November 27, 1968, they played a concert with Iron Butterfly at the Baltimore Civic Center. The group's following albums had several more hit singles, including \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" (which reached number three) from The Second and \\"Rock Me\\" (with its bridge lasting 1:06, which reached number 10) from At Your Birthday Party. It also sold in excess of a million units. Monster, which questioned US Vietnam War policy, was the band's most political album. Following the Monster album from 1969, the following year, the band released Steppenwolf 7, which included the song \\"Snowblind Friend\\", another Hoyt Axton-penned song about the era and attitudes of drugs and associated problems. The band lineup for their live performances in the middle of 1970 was John Kay, Jerry Edmonton, Goldy McJohn, Larry Byrom, and George Biondo. This lineup was also unable to remain together, as Byrom became upset with McJohn over personal issues and quit the band in the early part of 1971. Several changes in the group's personnel were made after the first few years. Moreve was fired from the group in 1968 for missing gigs after he became afraid to return to Los Angeles, convinced by his girlfriend that it was going to be leveled by an earthquake and fall into the sea. Rob Black briefly filled in for Moreve until former Sparrow bandmate Nick St. Nicholas came aboard in the latter months of 1968. Monarch quit the group in August 1969 as his relationship with Kay deteriorated. Larry Byrom, who had been in TIME with Nick St. Nicholas, ably replaced Monarch. Nick St. Nicholas was let go in mid-1970. He had supposedly appeared in nothing but rabbit ears and a jock strap at the Fillmore East in April 1970 ‚Äì and his habit of wearing muumuus and kaftans on stage began to wear on Kay, whose penchant for leather vests and pants was more in line with the image he wanted for the band. George Biondo was then recruited, and guitarist Kent Henry replaced Byrom in early 1971. In November 1971, the band released For Ladies Only, with the lineup consisting of Kay, Henry, Biondo, McJohn, and Edmonton. The album was notable for several reasons, most notably the controversial LP inside cover art, the romantic, political, and social lyrical content, and the fact that it featured several of the group members on lead vocals. =Breakup (1972‚Äì1973)= The band broke up after a farewell concert in Los Angeles on Valentine's Day, 1972. Kay went on to a brief solo career, scoring a minor solo hit in 1972 with \\"I'm Movin' On\\" from his album Forgotten Songs and Unsung Heroes. Although it received generally high marks from most critics, the album sales were disappointing in the US. Kay released a second solo album in 1973 on the Dunhill label titled My Sportin' Life. This album sold less than his first solo album and was less gritty and more LA studio-polish in sound. Following the first official breakup of Steppenwolf, and after the release of Kay's first solo album, a late summer and autumn 1972 tour in the US and Europe occurred, which featured Kay heading both the John Kay Band and Steppenwolf, at the top of the bill. Dunhill had released an album of a collection of Steppenwolf songs titled Rest in Peace. Thus, the tour was known as the RIP tour. The John Kay Band included Hugh Sullivan on keyboards and Whitey (Pentti) Glan on drums (both were contributors to John Kay's first solo album). Kent Henry on lead and slide guitar and George Biondo on bass joined Kay in both lineups. The Steppenwolf band lineup featured Goldy McJohn on keyboards and Jerry Edmonton on drums. This tour proved to be a fairly positive experience for all of the musicians and drew respectable crowd turnouts. Following this tour, while Kay was recording his second solo album in 1973, McJohn and Edmonton continued to play and formed a band called Manbeast. Some of the material created in the Manbeast days showed up on the 1974 Steppenwolf reunion album, most notably \\"Gang War Blues\\", which was recorded as a demo with Edmonton singing slightly different lyrics. =Reunion (1974‚Äì1976)= Steppenwolf reformed in 1974 with its core lineup of Kay, Edmonton, and McJohn, along with longtime bassist Biondo and newcomer Bobby Cochran, Eddie Cochran's nephew, on lead guitar. The band signed with Mums Records in retaliation for what Kay perceived as a lack of support by Dunhill Records for his solo albums. Their first reunion album was Slow Flux, which included their last top 40 hit, \\"Straight Shootin' Woman\\". In February 1975, McJohn was dismissed for what Kay described as a decline in the quality of his performances, as well as erratic behavior. McJohn was replaced by Andy Chapin on Hour of the Wolf in 1975, though McJohn appeared in artwork for the single to Caroline. After the album peaked at number 155, Kay attempted to dissolve the band again, but the label, now having been absorbed by Epic Records, insisted Steppenwolf record one more album to satisfy their contractual obligations. The ensuing album, Skullduggery (1976), featuring Wayne Cook on keyboards, was released without a tour to support it, and by the early fall of 1976, Steppenwolf disbanded a second time. Kay appeared in a segment of the popular music TV show The Midnight Special to announce the end of Steppenwolf and also played a solo version of the song \\"Hey I'm Alright\\". This song appeared on Kay's third solo album All In Good Time, released on Mercury Records in 1978. =\\"New Steppenwolf\\" revival act (1976‚Äì1980)= After Kay disbanded Steppenwolf, former members Goldy McJohn and Nick St. Nicholas formed a \\"revival act\\" called \\"New Steppenwolf\\". McJohn did not last long, but St. Nicholas continued with the venture for several years. Various incarnations included, according to author Dave Thompson, a \\"revolving door of musicians\\" consisting of \\"jobbing players\\". Among those players were vocalist Tom Holland and drummer Steve Riley of future W.A.S.P. and L.A. Guns fame. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll described these bands as \\"unprofessional, bogus versions\\" of Steppenwolf. Although Kay and Edmonton had originally licensed the use of the \\"New Steppenwolf\\" name, they later sued for breach of the contract. St. Nicholas agreed in 1980 to cease use of the name, but legal disputes about promotional use of the Steppenwolf name continued until 2000. =John Kay and Steppenwolf (1980‚Äì2018)= Kay and Steppenwolf performing in Lillehammer, Norway, May 26, 2007 Kay had a few meetings with David Pesnell about management, concert promotions, and producing a new album for the band. Pesnell wanted to produce an album featuring new songs on side A, by the reformed band Three Dog Night and with side B of the album featuring songs by Steppenwolf. The album's working name was \\"Back to Back\\", a play on each band having a side of the album and the fact the bands were back together again. Pesnell's concept was simple: each band should record four new songs, with a fifth song on each side featuring a medley of the band's past songs. This would give the Pesnell-produced album a double release of singles to support a concert tour featuring the two bands. Though both bands liked the concept of the album and tour, the arguments included who would be side A and side B and which of the two would headline the upcoming concert tour. The reformed John Kay and Steppenwolf line-up featured John Kay, Michael Palmer (guitars, backing vocals), Steve Palmer (drums, backing vocals), Danny Ironstone (keyboards, backing vocals), and Kurtis Teel on bass. The Palmer brothers had played in a group called Tall Water and had also been involved with Kay in his solo career playing live gigs in the late 1970s. Teel was replaced by Chad Peery and Ironstone by Brett Tuggle by 1981, and the new grouping released Live in London overseas. Tuggle was then displaced by Michael Wilk and a new studio album, Wolftracks, was released in 1982 on the small Attic (Nautilus in the U.S.) record label. Wolftracks was one of the earliest digitally recorded albums in the industry. It was recorded live on a two-track Sony digital recording system. Bassist Welton Gite, who appeared on this album, left shortly after its completion and was replaced by Gary Link, formerly with Dokken. Another album, Paradox, followed in 1984. In December 1984 the band as it was disbanded and Kay and Wilk decided to continue on in early 1985 with a pared-down quartet composed of Kay, Wilk, Wilk's friend Ron Hurst (drums, backing vocals), and Rocket Ritchotte (guitars, backing vocals). Wilk also handled bass duties from his sequencing computer keyboards from then on. This line-up released Rock N' Roll Rebels (1987) and Rise & Shine (1990); these were on the Qwil and I.R.S. Records imprints, respectively. Ritchotte had departed temporarily in 1989 to be replaced by Les Dudek and then Steve Fister, but then returned in 1990 for three more years. Fister (ex-Iron Butterfly) came back in late 1993, but turned guitar duties over to Danny Johnson (formerly of Derringer, Rod Stewart, and others) in 1996. As the band was named after the novel Der Steppenwolf by German author Hermann Hesse, who was born in the Black Forest town of Calw, the city invited them to come over and play in the International Hermann-Hesse-Festival 2002, along with other bands inspired by Hesse, such as Anyone's Daughter. The concert drew considerable media coverage, with Kay's fluent German stunning those who did not know beforehand about his growing up in Germany ‚Äì in fact, he was born Joachim Fritz Krauledat in Tilsit, East Prussia, Germany (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). The band performed what they then labeled their \\"Farewell Concert\\" on October 6, 2007, at Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, Maryland, featuring Kay, keyboardist and programmer Michael Wilk, drummer Ron Hurst and guitarist Danny Johnson. However, the band, rejoined by bassist Gary Link, began touring again in June 2009. Steppenwolf were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, but were not inducted. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Steppenwolf among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire. On November 22, 2019, John Kay announced that the band's October 14, 2018 show was their last.

It is a chemically peculiar B7 giant star, 134 light years away from Earth. It had a co-existing name Gamma Aurigae. Nomenclature This star has two Bayer designations: Œ≤ Tauri (Latinised to Beta Tauri) and Œ≥ Aurigae (Latinised to Gamma Aurigae). Ptolemy considered the star to be shared by Auriga, and Johann Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations. When the modern constellation boundaries were fixed in 1930, the designation Œ≥ Aurigae largely dropped from use. The traditional name Elnath, variously El Nath or Alnath, comes from the Arabic word ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∑ÿ≠ an-na≈£ƒß, meaning \\"the butting\\" (i.e. the bull's horns). As in many other (but not all) Arabic star names, the article ÿßŸÑ is transliterated literally as el, despite the fact that in Arabic pronunciation it is assimilated to the following n; it can also be omitted: Nath. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Elnath for this star.

Accessed on line November 23, 2010.  Physical properties  Elnath's absolute magnitude is -1.34, similar to another star in Taurus, Maia in the Pleiades star cluster. Like Maia, Œ≤ Tauri is a B-class giant with a luminosity 700 times solar. It has evolved away from the main sequence to become a giant star, larger and cooler than when it was on the main sequence. However, being approximately 130 light-years distant compared to Maia's estimated 360 light-years, Œ≤ Tauri ranks as the second-brightest star in the constellation. It is a mercury-manganese star, a type of non-magnetic chemically peculiar star with unusually large signatures of some heavy elements in its spectrum. Relative to the Sun, Œ≤ Tauri is notable for a high abundance of manganese, but little calcium and magnesium. However, the lack of strong mercury signatures, together with notably high levels of silicon and chromium, have led some authors to give other classifications, including as a \\"SrCrEu star\\" or even an Ap star. At the southern edge of the quite narrow plane of the Milky Way Galaxy a few degrees west of the galactic anticenter, Œ≤ Tauri figures (appears) as a foreground object south of many nebulae and star clusters such as M36, M37, and M38. It is 5.39 degrees north of the ecliptic, so it can be occulted by the Moon. Such occultations occur when the Moon's ascending node is near the vernal equinox, as was the case in 2007. Most occultations are visible only in the Southern Hemisphere, because the star is at the northern edge of the lunar occultation zone. Rarely, it may be occulted as far north as southern California.  Companions  There is a faint star that appears close enough to Œ≤ Tauri for astronomers to consider it a double star. Its visual companion, known as BD+28 795B, has a position angle of 239 degrees and is separated from the main star by 33.4 arcseconds. Six closer and even fainter stars have been detected during a search for brown dwarf and planetary companions, but all are considered to be background objects.

They began as a psychedelic rock group and diversified their sound through the use of instruments such as keyboards like the Mellotron and harpsichord, sitar, and various reed instruments, and by incorporating jazz and improvisational techniques in their music. Their first three singles were \\"Paper Sun\\", \\"Hole in My Shoe\\", and \\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\\". Traffic disbanded in 1969, during which time Winwood joined Blind Faith, then reunited in 1970 to release the album John Barleycorn Must Die. The band's line-up varied from this point until they disbanded again in 1974. A partial reunion, with Winwood and Capaldi, took place in 1994. Traffic were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. History Traffic's singer, keyboardist, and guitarist Steve Winwood was the lead singer for the Spencer Davis Group at age 14. The Spencer Davis Group released four Top Ten singles and three Top Ten albums in the United Kingdom, as well as two Top Ten singles in the United States. Drummer/vocalist/lyricist Jim Capaldi and guitarist Dave Mason had both been in the Hellions and Deep Feeling, while woodwinds player Chris Wood came out of Locomotive. Winwood, Capaldi, Mason, and Wood met when they jammed together at The Elbow Room, a club in Aston, Birmingham. After Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967, the quartet formed Traffic. Capaldi came up with the name of the group while the four of them were waiting to cross the street in Dorchester. Soon thereafter, they rented a cottage near the rural village of Aston Tirrold, Berkshire to write and rehearse new music. Traffic signed to Chris Blackwell's Island Records label (where Winwood's elder brother Muff, also a member of the Spencer Davis Group, later became a record producer and executive), and their debut single \\"Paper Sun\\" became a UK hit in mid-1967 (#4 Canada). Their second single, Mason's psych-pop \\"Hole in My Shoe\\", was an even bigger hit (#4 Canada), and it became one of their best-known tracks. The band's third single, \\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\\", was made for the soundtrack of the 1967 British feature film of the same name. Their debut album was Mr. Fantasy, produced by Jimmy Miller, and like the singles, was a hit in the UK but not as big elsewhere, although it did reach number 88 in the US.Traffic in the USA charts , Allmusic.

Released in 1968, it included the original version of Mason's \\"Feelin' Alright\\", which was later recorded with great success by Joe Cocker and Three Dog Night. Winwood, Wood, and Capaldi wanted to take the group in a different direction, opting for a folk/blues style rather than their earlier psychedelic/eclectic rock sound, while Mason was oriented towards psychedelic pop. Mason also cited discomfort with the Traffic lifestyle. The band toured the US as a trio in late 1968, which led to the following year's release of Traffic's next album, Last Exit, one side of which was recorded live. During 1968 Winwood and Wood often played with Jimi Hendrix, and they both appear on The Jimi Hendrix Experience's 1968 double album Electric Ladyland, as did an uncredited Mason. The band was dissolved by Winwood's leaving in early 1969. His departure went unexplained at the time, even to Capaldi and Wood, but he later said \\"Because of the way I ended the Spencer Davis Group, I saw no reason why I shouldn't leave Traffic and move on. It seemed to me a normal thing to do.\\" Winwood's comments clash with the fact that the Davis group continued after he left. Winwood then formed the supergroup Blind Faith, which lasted less than a year, recording one album and undertaking one US tour. The remaining members of Traffic began a project with Mick Weaver (a.k.a. Wynder K. Frog), the short-lived Mason, Capaldi, Wood and Frog (later shortened to Wooden Frog), which played a few live dates and recorded some BBC sessions, but broke up before releasing any formal recordings. After the break-up of Blind Faith in 1969, Winwood began working on a solo recording, bringing in Wood and Capaldi to contribute, and the project eventually turned into a new Traffic album, John Barleycorn Must Die, their most successful album yet. Traffic went on to expand its lineup late in 1970, adding Winwood's former Blind Faith bandmate Ric Grech on bass. The group further expanded in 1971 with drummer Jim Gordon of Derek and the Dominos and Ghanaian percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah. The live album Welcome to the Canteen was released in September and marked the band's break with United Artists Records. It did not bear the \\"Traffic\\" name on the cover, and instead was credited to the band's individual members including Mason, who returned for his third and final spell with the band. The album ended with a version of The Spencer Davis Group song \\"Gimme Some Loving\\", which became a minor hit. Following the departure of Mason, Traffic released The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys (1971), which was a Top 10 American album but did not chart in the UK; the LP is also notable for its die-cut cover. It sold over half a million copies in 1972 when it received a gold disc, and was awarded a R.I.A.A. platinum disc in March 1976 for over a million total sales. Once again, however, personnel problems wracked the band as Grech and Gordon left the band in December 1971,Joynson, Vernon (1995). The Tapestry of Delights .

Jim Capaldi used this hiatus to record a solo album, Oh How We Danced,Capaldi, Jim (1983). \\"The Ends of Traffic, Soloing & Brazil\\", Fierce Heart press kit. which would prove to be the beginning of a long and successful solo career. The album included a surplus recording from The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys, \\"Open Your Heart\\", and the new tracks featured drummer Roger Hawkins and bassist David Hood, from the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio house band. Capaldi soon brought them on board to replace Grech and Gordon. The new lineup (Winwood, Capaldi, Wood, Kwaku Baah, Hawkins, Hood) toured America in early 1972 to promote the LP, and their concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on 21 February was recorded in multitrack audio and captured on colour videotape with multiple cameras. The 64-minute performance is thought to be the only extended live footage of the group. It was evidently not broadcast on television at the time, but was later released on home video and DVD. Following Winwood's recovery from peritonitis, Traffic's sixth studio album, Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory, released in 1973, met with a cold critical reception, but in sales it was another major hit. It was shortly followed by a major world tour, from which the double live album, On the Road, was drawn. It broke the band's string of British flops by reaching number 40 in the UK Albums Chart.Traffic in the UK Charts , The Official Charts. Retrieved 11 August 2011. However, these successes were soured by the departure of Hawkins, Hood, and Kwaku Baah at the end of the world tour, and by Chris Wood's increasing problems with drug use and depression. Bassist Rosko Gee replaced David Hood, while Capaldi switched back to drums. When the Eagle Flies, released in 1974, was yet another Top Ten album in the US, and moderately successful in the UK. However, a subsequent tour of the US, while successful in terms of ticket sales, was emotionally exhausting for the band. Capaldi later recalled \\"Rosko Gee and I were the only ones in anything like normal shape. Steve was having recurrent problems with the peritonitis, and Chris's body was suffering from chemical warfare.\\" Winwood ultimately passed his boiling point, walking off the stage in the middle of what would prove the band's final show, in Chicago. The following day he left the tour without a word to anyone, leaving the rest of the band waiting for him at the venue for that night's scheduled performance. Feeling Winwood had been integral to Traffic's music, the remaining members opted not to continue the band without him. Traffic's break-up was followed by two compilations from United Artists (Heavy Traffic and More Heavy Traffic), both of which only drew from the first half of their output. Steve Winwood embarked on a solo career, while Rosko Gee and Rebop Kwaku Baah joined German band Can. Kwaku Baah died on stage from a cerebral hemorrhage in Stockholm, Sweden in 1983, and Capaldi dedicated his solo album Fierce Heart to his memory. Chris Wood also died that year from pneumonia. Winwood and Capaldi, 1994 All the still living members of Traffic's most recent lineup reunited in 1994 for a one-off tour, after a fan left a voice mail message at Bob Weir's (of the Grateful Dead) hotel in Chicago during the 1992 \\"Scaring the Children\\" tour, and suggested it would be cool if Traffic toured with the (then Grateful) Dead. Traffic opened for the Grateful Dead during their summer tour. The flute/sax role on the tour was played by Randall Bramblett, who had worked extensively with Steve Winwood. Mike McEvoy joined the line up playing keyboards, guitar and viola, and Walfredo Reyes, Jr. played drums and percussion. Winwood and Capaldi recorded and released a new Traffic album, Far from Home, with no involvement from the other four members. It broke the top 40 in both the UK and USA. The Last Great Traffic Jam, a double live album and DVD released in 2005, documents the band's 1994 reunion tour. The four original members of Traffic were inducted for their contributions in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 2004. Winwood, Capaldi, Mason, and Stephanie Wood (standing in for her late brother Chris) all attended the ceremony. Winwood and Capaldi took part in the induction performance, but were joined by Dave Mason performing his song 'Feelin' Alright' for the grand finale which also featured Keith Richards, Tom Petty, and the Temptations. The induction lineup was completed by Bramblett on organ and bass pedals, even though he was not one of the members inducted.(2011). In Dear Mr Fantasy: The Jim Capaldi Story (pp.32‚Äì43) [CD booklet]. London: Freedom Songs Ltd. Tentative plans for another Traffic project were cut short by Jim Capaldi's death from stomach cancer at age 60 in January 2005, ending the songwriting partnership with Winwood that had fueled Traffic from its beginning. Winwood subsequently dedicated The Last Great Traffic Jam \\"to the man without whom Traffic could never be: my lifelong friend and partner, Jim Capaldi.\\" Dear Mr. Fantasy was a celebration for Capaldi that took place at The Roundhouse in Camden Town, London on 21 January 2007. Guests included Steve Winwood, Paul Weller, Pete Townshend, and many more. Dear Mr. Fantasy featured the music of Jim Capaldi and Traffic, and all profits went to The Jubilee Action Street Children Appeal.

air show disaster occurred on 27 July 2002, when a Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 piloted by Volodymyr Toponar and co- piloted by Yuriy Yegorov crashed during an aerobatics presentation at Sknyliv airfield near Lviv, Ukraine. The accident killed 77 people and injured 543, 100 of whom were hospitalised. It is the deadliest air show accident in history.  Accident  More than 10,000 spectators attended the Saturday air show, staged to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Ukrainian Air Force's 14th Air Corps. The Su-27 aircraft was flown by two experienced pilots; it entered a rolling maneuver at 12:52 p.m. with a downward trajectory at low altitude. It rolled upright once more and was still descending rapidly when the left wing dropped shortly before it hit the ground, at which point the crew initiated ejection. The aircraft flattened out initially, skidding over the ground towards stationary aircraft and striking a glancing blow against the nose of an Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft before beginning to explode and cartwheel into the crowd of spectators. Both pilots survived with minor injuries, while 77 spectators were killed, including 28 children (though initial reports by the Emergency Situations Ministry put the number of dead at 83, including 23 children). Another 100 were hospitalized for head injuries, burns, and bone fractures. Other injuries were less severe and did not require hospitalization; a total of 543 people were injured during the accident. Following the disaster, the pilots stated that the flight map which they had received differed from the actual layout. On the cockpit voice recorder, one pilot asks, \\"And where are our spectators?\\" Others have suggested that the pilots were slow to react to automated warnings issued by the flight computer.  Aftermath  Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma publicly blamed the military for the disaster and dismissed head of the air force, General Viktor Strelnykov.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2160690.stm Defense minister Volodymyr Shkidchenko sent in his resignation, but Kuchma rejected it. On 24 June 2005, a military court sentenced pilot Volodymyr Toponar and co-pilot Yuriy Yegorov to 14 and 8 years in prison, respectively. The court found the two pilots and three other military officials guilty of failing to follow orders, negligence, and violating flight rules. Two of the three officials were sentenced to up to six years in prison, and the last official received up to four years. In addition, Toponar was ordered to pay 7.2 million Ukrainian hryvnia (US$1.42 million; ‚Ç¨1.18 million) in compensation to the families, and Yegorov 2.5 million hryvnia. The crew's main flight trainer was acquitted for lack of evidence.CNN news report, 24 June 2005 (after the verdict)Aviation Web news report, 29 June 2005 (after the verdict) After the verdict was announced, Toponar said that he planned to appeal, insisting that the crash was due to technical problems and a faulty flight plan. Yegorov was released in 2008 after President Yushchenko issued a decree reducing his sentence to three and a half years. The pilots were assigned the majority of the blame, which included accusations of attempting maneuvers with which they were not experienced. Toponar had requested an additional training flight at the airfield where the display was to be performed; this request was denied.

(1998). \\"David Allan Coe.\\" In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 102. Coe took up music after spending much of his early life in reform schools and prisons, and first became notable for busking in Nashville. He initially played mostly in the blues style, before transitioning to country music, becoming a major part of the 1970s outlaw country scene. His biggest hits were \\"Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile\\", \\"The Ride\\", \\"You Never Even Called Me by My Name\\", \\"She Used to Love Me a Lot\\", and \\"Longhaired Redneck\\". His most popular songs performed by others are the number-one hits \\"Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)\\" sung by Tanya Tucker and Johnny Paycheck's rendition of \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\". The latter inspired the movie of the same name. Coe's rebellious attitude, wild image, and unconventional lifestyle set him apart from other country performers, both winning him legions of fans and hindering his mainstream success by alienating the music industry establishment. Coe continues to be a popular performer on the country circuit.  Biography  Coe was born in Akron, Ohio. His favorite singer as a child was Johnny Cash. After being sent to the Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school at the age of nine, he spent much of the next 20 years in correctional facilities, including three years at the Ohio Penitentiary. Coe claimed he received encouragement to begin writing songs from Screamin' Jay Hawkins, with whom he had spent time in prison. After concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium. He caught the attention of the independent record label Plantation Records and signed a contract with the label. He is the father of Tyler Mahan Coe, who created the country music podcast Cocaine & Rhinestones. He has a daughter, Shelli Coe Mackie, and is father-in-law to the late Michael Mackie, formerly of Texas band 'Thunderosa'.  Music career = Early career (1970‚Äì75) = Early in 1970, Coe released his debut album, Penitentiary Blues, followed by a tour with Grand Funk Railroad. In October 1971, he signed as an exclusive writer with Pete and Rose Drake's publishing company Windows Publishing Company, Inc. in Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained until 1977. Although he developed a cult following with his performances, he was not able to develop any mainstream success, but other performers achieved charting success by recording songs Coe had written, including Billie Jo Spears' 1972 recordings \\"Souvenirs & California Mem'rys\\" and Tanya Tucker's 1973 single \\"Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)\\", which was a No. 1 hit, and responsible for Coe becoming one of Nashville's hottest songwriters and Coe himself being signed by Columbia Records. Coe recorded his own version of the song for his second Columbia album, Once Upon a Rhyme, released in 1975. AllMusic writer Thom Jurek said of the song, \\"The amazing thing is that both versions are definitive.\\" Unlike Coe's first two albums, his third showed full commitment to country music, and Coe would play a part in the evolution of what would become known as outlaw country. The title of Coe's third album, The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, refers to the gimmick Coe adopted several years before Glen Campbell had a hit with the song \\" Rhinestone Cowboy\\": dressing up in a rhinestone suit and wearing a Lone Ranger mask. The singer later recalled to Michael Buffalo Smith in 2004, \\"I guess I have to blame it on Mel Tillis. I met him when I first went to Nashville and he had an office down on Music Row. I was over there talking to him in his office, and he opened up the closet to get something and he had a whole closet full of rhinestone suits. I just freaked out on that. He looked at me and said ‚ÄòYou like that shit, I don't even wear those, if you want ‚Äòem take ‚Äòem!' He gave me those rhinestone suits and I wore them everywhere.\\" Coe maintained the idea for the mask came from his father: Coe's second album Once Upon a Rhyme contains one of his biggest hits, \\"You Never Even Called Me by My Name\\", written by Steve Goodman and John Prine and which first appeared on Goodman's 1971 debut release. Coe's version became his first country Top 10 hit single, peaking at #8 in 1975, and includes a spoken epilogue where Coe relates a correspondence he had with Goodman, who stated the song he had written was the 'perfect country and western song'. Coe wrote back stating that no song could fit that description without mentioning a laundry list of clich√©s: \\"mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk\\". Goodman's equally facetious response was an additional verse that incorporated all five of Coe's requirements, and upon receiving it, Coe acknowledged that the finished product was indeed the 'perfect country and western song' and included the last verse on the record: > I was drunk the day Mama got out of prison > And I went to pick 'er up in the rain > But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck > She got runned over by a damned ol' train Coe was a featured performer in Heartworn Highways, a 1975 documentary film by James Szalapski. Other performers featured included Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Young, Steve Earle, and the Charlie Daniels Band. Coe also wrote \\"Cocaine Carolina\\" for Johnny Cash and sang background vocals on the recording that appeared on Cash's 1975 album John R. Cash. = Outlaw years (1976‚Äì82) = By 1976, the outlaw country movement was in full swing as artists such as Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson were finally enjoying massive commercial success after years of fighting to record their music their own way. Coe, however, was still somewhat an outsider, almost too outlaw for the outlaws, a predicament summed up well by AllMusic: Longhaired Redneck was Coe's third album for Columbia in three years, and the first where he wrote or co-wrote all the songs; the outlaw country zeitgeist was summed up well in the title track, which recounts playing in a dive \\"where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies who are praying they'll get out of here alive\\". The song, which has an unmistakable rock swagger, features Coe performing impressive imitations of Ernest Tubb, Bill Anderson, and Merle Haggard, making it irretrievably country as well, illustrating the dichotomy of what was being referred to as 'progressive' country music. Coe later explained, \\"It was terminology that I'd made up at the time. I was trying to tell people that not everybody with long hair was a hippie. Not everyone was the kind of person that thought you could punch them out, take their money and that they'd say, 'I won't do nothin' about it'.\\" By 1977, the outlaw movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of Willie Nelson's blockbuster album Red Headed Stranger and country music's first platinum selling album, Wanted! The Outlaws. Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in AllMusic's review of the album, \\"On Rides Again, by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement's two progenitors on the opening track, \\"Willie, Waylon, and Me\\"...Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally ‚Äì something that continued to curse him.\\" The songs on Rides Again cross-fade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe's heavily phased guitar. Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time. However, some of his peers resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws. Jennings drummer Richie Albright called Coe \\"a great, great songwriter. A great singer. But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he'd made up. Waylon didn't make him comfortable enough to hang around. But Willie did. I was around Willie quite a bit and David Allan was with him eighty percent of the time. Willie allowed him to hang around.\\" Coe managed to maintain friendships with both Jennings and Nelson, despite the former's cool treatment of him at times. In his autobiography, Jennings mentions Coe once (in a chapter titled \\"The Outlaw Shit\\"), calling him \\"the most sincere of the bunch\\" of bandwagon jumpers, but contends \\"when it came to being an Outlaw, the worst thing he ever did was double-parking on Music Row\\", adding: Throughout the rest of the decade, Coe released a string of strong recordings, some of which, such as Human Emotions (1978) and Spectrum VII (1979), were concept albums with each side of the discs given their own theme. 1978's Family Album contains Coe's rendition of \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\", a song he composed and which had been released by Johnny Paycheck in October 1977, becoming a monumental success. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name. Although Coe's name was credited, the assumption by many was that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune; this would feed into Coe's growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star Jimmy Buffett accused him of plagiarising his hit \\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\\" for Coe's \\"Divers Do It Deeper\\". (Coe had been incorporating Caribbean sounds into his music, as is evident on his 1979 album Compass Point.) By 1980, Coe and producer Billy Sherrill set out to reach a wider audience and bring Coe back to the charts, by inviting other singers and musicians to take part in the sessions for what would become I've Got Something to Say, which would boast contributions from Guy Clark, Bill Anderson, Dickey Betts (from The Allman Brothers Band), Kris Kristofferson, Larry Jon Wilson, and George Jones. This process was continued the following year on Invictus (Means) Unconquered, with Sherrill couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe's voice. (In his AllMusic review, Thom Jurek labelled it 'arguably the finest album of his career') By 1981, the outlaw country movement waned as the slicker 'urban cowboy' era took hold in country music, typified by the Johnny Lee hit \\"Lookin' for Love\\", which critic Kurt Wolff panned as an example of 'watered- down cowboy music'.Wolff, Kurt, \\"Country Music: The Rough Guide,\\" Rough Guides Ltd., London; Penguin Putnam, New York, distributor. p. 424 () Coe was an important figure in the outlaw country genre, but judging by the sound of his recordings from this period, he had no interest in the trendy urban cowboy phase. Refusing to give into the flavor-of-the-month generic country 'talent', Coe stuck to what he knew and sharpened the edges. However, while scoring some moderate hits, mainstream success remained elusive. Coe's highest- charting single during this period was \\"Get a Little Dirt on Your Hands\\", a duet with Bill Anderson, which peaked at #45. As if aware of the compromises he had been making, Coe chose to close out his 1982 album D.A.C. with a suite of three songs that contained a short prologue: = Commercial success (1983‚Äì89) = Castles in the Sand would be a huge comeback for Coe, peaking at #8 on the country albums chart, his highest showing since Once Upon a Rhyme hit the same mark eight years earlier. Its success was spurred on by \\"The Ride\\", which was released in February 1983 as the lead single from the album and reached #1 on the June 4 Cashbox Country Singles Chart.http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c/80s_files/19830604C.html It spent 19 weeks on the Billboard country singles charts, reaching a peak of #4 and hitting #2 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. The ballad tells the first-person story of a hitchhiker's encounter with the ghost of Hank Williams, Sr. in a ride from Montgomery, Alabama to Nashville, Tennessee.Billboard, March 19, 1983 The mysterious driver, 'dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed', questions the narrator whether he has the musical talent and dedication to become a star in the country music industry. The song's lyrics place the events on U.S. Route 31 or the largely parallel Interstate 65. Buoyed by the single, Castles in the Sand became the mainstream breakthrough that Coe and producer Billy Sherrill had been trying for since the decade began. 1984's Just Divorced contains Coe's second biggest chart hit, \\"Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile\\", which rose to #2 on the Billboard country singles chart and #3 on Cashboxhttp://cashboxmagazine.com/archives-c.htm. In Canada, it reached No. 1 on the RPM Country Tracks charts dated for June 30, 1984. The song is a mid-tempo ballad about a young blonde girl, featuring allusions to the iconic Da Vinci painting. The song features one of producer Billy Sherrill's most elaborate productions, with one critic commenting, 'The layered strings and organ work are slick, but they add such warmth and depth in contrast to Coe's voice that it works to devastating effect.' Another hit, \\"She Used to Love Me a Lot\\", was released in December 1984 and peaked at # 11 on both the US Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. (A version of the song by Johnny Cash was recorded in the early 1980s, but remained unreleased until 2014.) The song tells of a chance meeting between two ex-lovers at 'the Silver Spoon Caf√©', but when the man tries to rekindle the romance, she dismisses him in the same cavalier way he did her years earlier. It was written by Dennis Morgan, Charles Quillen, and Kye Fleming, as Coe - who continued to write songs of high quality - nonetheless relied on outside writers to get him in the charts. The 1986 album Son of the South would include contributions from fellow outlaw legends Nelson, Jennings, and Jessie Colter. His final recording for Columbia, the concept album A Matter of Life‚Ä¶and Death, was released in 1987. = Later career (1990 ‚Äì present) = In 1990, Coe reissued his independent albums Nothing Sacred and Underground Album on compact disc, as well as the compilation 18 X-Rated Hits. Throughout the 1990s, Coe had a successful career as a concert performer in the United States and Europe. In 1999, Coe met Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell in Fort Worth, Texas, and the two musicians, struck by the similarity of the approaches between country and heavy metal, agreed to work together, and began production on an album. In 2000, Coe toured as the opening act for Kid Rock, and The New York Times published an article by journalist Neil Strauss, who described the material on Nothing Sacred and Underground Album as \\"among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic, and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter.\\" Coe maintains that he wrote to Strauss during the writing of the article, but the journalist did not acknowledge any interaction between the two, only stating that Coe's manager refused to speak on the record. In 2003, Coe wrote a song for Kid Rock, \\"Single Father\\", which appeared on Kid Rock's self-titled album, and was released as a single, which peaked at number 50 on the Billboard Country Singles chart. Rebel Meets Rebel, with Dimebag Darrell, Vinnie Paul, and Rex Brown, recorded sporadically between 1999 and 2003, was released in 2006, two years after Darrell's murder. AllMusic described it as a \\"groundbreaking\\" country metal album. In the 2006 video \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\", Coe introduces Johnny Cash as the Man in Black. The video, directed by Tony Kaye, was released in connection with Cash's cover of the song in American V: A Hundred Highways. In 2017, he was featured singing \\"Take This Job\\" on the album Baptized in Bourbon by the Moonshine Bandits. He also sings in the video. Controversy= Outlaw origins and racism accusations = Although he was capable of writing deeply tender love songs, Coe's outrageous appearance, defiant attitude, and controversial background kept him from being fully embraced by the mainstream in the same way some of his peers would be. Coe's integrity was called into question after his previous claim that he had spent time on death row for killing an inmate who tried to rape him, was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials - but never murder. Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the outlaw country movement getting its name, explaining in 2003: Coe was uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows. For example, \\"The House We've Been Calling Home\\", from the 1977 album Rides Again, explores the theme of polygamy ('me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we've been calling a home...'), while on the final cut on the album, \\"If That Ain't Country (I‚Äôll Kiss Your Ass)\\", Coe utters a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line 'workin' like a nigger for my room and board'. The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as 'veteran proud' and deeming his oldest sister 'a first-rate whore'. The song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream, and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied. In 2004 he remarked: The cover of the 1986 release Son of the South, which displayed Coe holding a baby with a Confederate flag draped over his shoulders, galled many industry insiders, although Coe did print a message on the back of the album to defuse any potential backlash: In another interview, Coe said, \\"Anyone that would look at me and say I was a racist, would have to be out of their mind. I have dreadlocks down to my waist with earrings in both ears and my beard is down to my waist and it is in braids...I was in prison with 87% black people, I hung around with black people, and I learned to sing music with black people. It was ironic that in prison the white guys called me a 'nigger lover' and now I write the word 'nigger' in a song and I am all of a sudden a racist. It is pretty ironic.\\" = Underground albums = While Coe lived in Key West, Shel Silverstein played his comedy album Freakin' at the Freakers Ball for Coe, spurring him to perform his own comedic songs for Silverstein, who encouraged Coe to record them, leading to the production of the independently released Nothing Sacred. Jimmy Buffett accused Coe of plagiarizing the melody of \\"Divers Do It Deeper\\" from Buffett's \\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\\", stating, \\"I would have sued him, but I didn't want to give Coe the pleasure of having his name in the paper.\\" In response to the success of Buffett's song, Coe wrote a song insulting Buffett, and it appeared on Nothing Sacred. The album was released by mail order in 1978, through the back pages of the biker magazine Easyriders. Coe's 1979 Columbia album Spectrum VII contained a note stating \\"Jimmy Buffett does not live in Key West anymore\\", a lyric from a song from Nothing Sacred. The lyrics of said album are profane, often sexually explicit, and describe an orgy in Nashville's Centennial Park and sex with pornographic film star Linda Lovelace. The album also contains a song targeting Anita Bryant, a musician notable for her strong opposition to LGBT rights, specifically her fight to repeal an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Miami-Dade County. In the song, bluntly titled \\"Fuck Aneta Briant\\" , Coe calls out Bryant as being hypocritical for her opposition to the lifestyles of gay people, stating that \\"In fact Anita Bryant, some act just like you\\". In 1982, Coe released another independent album, Underground Album, which contained his most controversial song, \\"Nigger Fucker\\", which resulted in Coe being accused of racism. Primarily because of this song, the material recorded by singer and white supremacist Johnny Rebel is mistakenly attributed to Coe. (Rebel, whose real name is Clifford Joseph Trahan, died in 2016.) AllMusic, which did not review Underground Album, gave it three out of five stars. Coe responded to the accusations by saying \\"Anyone that hears this album and says I'm a racist, is full of shit.\\" Coe's drummer, Kerry Brown, is black and married to a white woman, as was Brown's late father, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown. = Bankruptcy = Like Willie Nelson and Jerry Lee Lewis, Coe has battled the IRS costing him the publishing rights to his compositions, including ‚ÄúTake This Job and Shove It‚Äù. He stated in 2003: In another interview, Coe added, \\"All the songs on the X-rated albums were sold. I don't own that stuff anymore. I have nothing to do with that stuff. They have to give me credit as the songwriter, but I don't make one cent.\\" Style Coe's musical style derives from blues, rock, and country music traditions. His vocal style is described as a 'throaty baritone'. His lyrical content is often humorous or comedic, with William Ruhlmann describing him as a 'near-parody of a country singer'. Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Coe as \\"a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest honky-tonk and hardest country of his era [‚Ä¶] he may not be the most original outlaw, but there is none more outlaw than him\\". Coe's lyrics frequently include references to alcohol and drug use, and are often boisterous and cocky. Coe's debut album Penitentiary Blues was described as \\"voodoo blues\\" and \\"redneck music\\" by Allmusic's Thom Jurek. It focused on themes such as working for the first time, blood tests from veins used to inject heroin, prison time, hoodoo imagery, and death. The album's influences included Charlie Rich, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Tony Joe White. Coe later explained to Kristofer Engelhardt of Review: \\"I didn't really care for some of the country music until people like Kris Kristofferson and some of those people started writing songs. They had a little more to say than just, 'Oh baby I miss you', or whatever. I don't do anything halfway. Once I got into country music, I went back and researched it, and learned everything there was to know about it. I could do impersonations of Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Marty Robbins, just about anybody. I knew just about all there was to know about country music.\\" Coe's first country album, The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, has been described as alt-country, 'pre-punk' and \\"a hillbilly version of Marc Bolan's glitz and glitter\\". Credited influences on the album include Merle Haggard. In his early career, Coe was known for his unpredictable live performances, in which he would ride a Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the stage and curse at his audience. Coe has also performed in a rhinestone suit and a mask which resembled that of the Lone Ranger, calling himself the 'Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy'. The album Rebel Meets Rebel featured a song, \\"Cherokee Cry\\", which criticizes the United States government's treatment of Native Americans. When asked why he did not write more political songs, Coe replied, \\"I live in my own world, not thee world. I just write songs about what affects me in everyday life. At one point I wrote a song that was sort of a protest about when they were talking about drafting women into the military. It was about my son making it past the draft, but my daughter didn't. And I've done Farm Aid.\\" In his review of Coe's 1987 album A Matter of Life...and Death, Allmusic's Thom Jurek wrote, \\"Coe may have had some hits, but it is records like this that make one wonder if there was not a conspiracy to marginalize him and make him fail. Coe is a brilliant songwriter well into the 21st century, and deserves to be lauded along with the likes of [Willie] Nelson and [Waylon] Jennings and Kristofferson and Newbury ‚Äì and even Cash.\\" DiscographyBibliography * Just for the Record...the Autobiography * The Book of David * Ex-Convict * Poems, Prose and Short Stories * Psychopath * Whoopsy Daisy (audio book) References Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American country singer- songwriters Category:People from Key West, Florida Category:Singers from Ohio Category:King Records artists Category:Obscenity controversies in music Category:American country guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Songwriters from North Carolina Category:Songwriters from Florida Category:Songwriters from Ohio Category:Guitarists from North Carolina Category:Guitarists from Ohio Category:Country musicians from Ohio ","title":"David Allan Coe"},{"id":"168269","text":"The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton Agreement or the Dayton Accords, ( / –î–µ—ò—Ç–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏ —Å–ø–æ—Ä–∞–∑—É–º) is the peace agreement reached at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, United States, on 1 November 1995, and formally signed in Paris, on 14 December 1995. These accords put an end to the -year-long Bosnian War, one of the Yugoslav Wars. The warring parties agreed to peace and to a single sovereign state known as Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of two parts, the largely Serb-populated Republika Srpska and mainly Croat-Bosniak-populated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Negotiation and signature  Video of the signing of the Dayton Agreement Though basic elements of the Dayton Agreement were proposed in international talks as early as 1992,Munich All Over Again?, Time Magazine, 31 August 1992 these negotiations were initiated following the unsuccessful previous peace efforts and arrangements, the August 1995 Croatian military Operation Storm and its aftermath, the government military offensive against the Republika Srpska, conducted in parallel with NATO's Operation Deliberate Force. During September and October 1995, world powers (especially the United States and Russia), gathered in the Contact Group, applied intense pressure to the leaders of the three sides to attend the negotiations in Dayton, Ohio. The conference took place from 1‚Äì21 November 1995. The main participants from the region were the President of the Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (representing the Bosnian Serb interests due to the absence of Karad≈æiƒá), President of Croatia Franjo Tuƒëman, and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegoviƒá with his Foreign Minister Muhamed ≈†aƒáirbeg. The peace conference was led by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and negotiator Richard Holbrooke with two Co-Chairmen in the form of EU Special Representative Carl Bildt and the First Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Igor Ivanov. A key participant in the US delegation was General Wesley Clark. The head of the UK's team was Pauline Neville-Jones, political director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK military representative was Col Arundell David Leakey. Paul Williams, through the Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG) served as legal counsel to the Bosnian Government delegation during the negotiations. The secure site was chosen in order to remove all the parties from their comfort zone, without which they would have little incentive to negotiate; to reduce their ability to negotiate through the media; and to securely house over 800 staff and attendants. Curbing the participants' ability to negotiate via the media was a particularly important consideration. Richard Holbrooke wanted to prevent posturing through early leaks to the press. Holbrooke used a great variety of carrots and sticks to make the conflict 'ripe' for peace. The signing of the full and formal agreement in Paris. After having been initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on 21 November 1995, the full and formal agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 and witnessed by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, French President Jacques Chirac, US President Bill Clinton, UK Prime Minister John Major, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Content The agreement's main purpose is to promote peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to endorse regional balance in and around the former Yugoslavia (Article V, annex 1-B), thus in a regional perspective.Cannon, P., The Third Balkan War and Political Disunity: Creating A Cantonal Constitutional System for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Jrnl. Trans. L. & Pol., Vol. 5-2 The present political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its structure of government were agreed upon, as part the constitution that makes up Annex 4 of the General Framework Agreement concluded at Dayton. A key component of this was the delineation of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line to which many of the tasks listed in the Annexes referred.https://www.osce.org/bih/126173 The State of Bosnia Herzegovina was set as of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the Republika Srpska. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complete state, as opposed to a confederation; no entity or entities could ever be separated from Bosnia and Herzegovina unless by due legal process. Although highly decentralised in its entities, it would still retain a central government, with a rotating State Presidency, a central bank and a constitutional court. https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/nov/10/bosnia-bitter-flawed-peace- deal-dayton-agreement-20-years-on The agreement mandated a wide range of international organizations to monitor, oversee and implement components of the agreement. The NATO-led IFOR (Implementation Force) was responsible for implementing military aspects of the agreement and deployed on 20 December 1995, taking over the forces of the UNPROFOR. The Office of the High Representative was charged with the task of civil implementation. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe was charged with organising the first free elections in 1996. =Constitutional Court decision= On 13 October 1997, the Croatian 1861 Law Party and the Bosnia- Herzegovina 1861 Law Party requested the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina to annul several decisions and to confirm one decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more importantly, to review the constitutionality of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina since it was alleged that the agreement violated the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a way that it undermined the integrity of the state and could cause the dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court reached the conclusion that it is not competent to decide the dispute in regards to the mentioned decisions since the applicants were not subjects that were identified in Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution on those who can refer disputes to the Court. The Court also rejected the other request: It was one of the early cases in which the Court had to deal with the question of the legal nature of the Constitution. By making the remark in the manner of obiter dictum concerning the Annex IV (the Constitution) and the rest of the peace agreement, the Court actually \\"established the ground for legal unity\\"Vehaboviƒá, Faris (2006). Odnos Ustava Bosne i Hercegovine i Evropske konvencije za za≈°titu ljudskih prava i osnovnih sloboda. Sarajevo: ACIPS, 24. of the entire peace agreement, which further implied that all of the annexes are in the hierarchical equality. In later decisions the Court confirmed that by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis, not only in the context of systematic interpretation of the Annex IV. However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (Annex IV) came to power and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court used the same reasoning to dismiss the similar claim in a later case.Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-1/03, Sarajevo, 25 July 2003. Territorial changes Territorial changes. Political division of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Dayton Agreement. Before the agreement, Bosnian Serbs controlled about 46% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (23,687 km2), Bosniaks 28% (14,505 km2) and Bosnian Croats 25% (12,937 km2). Bosnian Serbs got large tracts of mountainous territories back (4% from Bosnian Croats and some small amounts from Bosniaks), but they had to surrender Sarajevo and some vital Eastern Bosnian/Herzegovian positions. Their percentage grew to 49% (48% by excluding the Brƒçko District, 24,526 km2). Bosniaks got most of Sarajevo and some important positions in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina while they lost only a few locations on Mount Ozren and in western Bosnia. Their percentage grew to 30%, and they greatly improved the quality of the land. Large tracts of prewar Bosniak (and Bosnian Croat) inhabited lands remained under Bosnian Serb control. Bosnian Croats gave most (4% of BiH territories) back to the Bosnian Serbs (9% of today's RS) and also retreated from Una-Sana Donji Vakuf (in Central Bosnia) afterward. A small enlargement of Posavina (Od≈æak and parts of Domaljevac) did not change the fact that after Dayton Bosnian Croats controlled just 21% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (10,640 km2), compared to more than 25% prior to Dayton. One of the most important Bosnian Croat territories (Posavina with Bosanski Brod, Bosanski ≈†amac, Derventa) was left out of Bosnian Croat control. =Control of Republika Srpska= *About 89.5% (22,059 km2) was under control of Bosnian Serbs *About 9% (2,117 km2) of today's territories of Republika Srpska was controlled by Bosnian Croat forces; mainly in municipalities of ≈†ipovo, Petrovac, Istoƒçni Drvar, Jezero, Kupres (RS) and part of Banja Luka municipality *About 1.5% (350 km2) of today's territories of Republika Srpska was controlled by Bosniak forces, mainly some villages in Ozren (Doboj and Petrovo), western Bosnia (Krupa na Uni and parts of Novi Grad and O≈°tra Luka). =Control of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina= *About 53% (13,955 km2) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was under Bosniak control. *About 41% (10,720 km2) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was under the control of Bosnian Croats. *About 6% (1,435 km2) was under control of Bosnian Serbs. Cantons Canton 10: *was almost completely under control of Bosnian Croats (4,924 km2) *Bosniaks controlled some points east of Kupres (10 km2) Una-Sana Canton: *was almost completely under control of Bosniaks (3,925 km2) *Bosnian Croats controlled some mountain passes on the southern parts of Bosanski Petrovac and Bihaƒá municipalities (200 km2) West Herzegovina Canton: *was completely under Bosnian Croat control (1,362 km2) Herzegovina-Neretva Canton: *was divided, more than half was under Bosnian Croat control (2,525 km2) *northern and central parts were under Bosniak control (1,666 km2) *eastern mountains were under Bosnian Serb control (210 km2) Central Bosnia Canton: *was divided, a bit more than a third was under Bosnian Croat control (1,099 km2) *rest was under control of Bosniaks (2,090 km2) Zenica-Doboj Canton: *was largely under Bosniak control (2,843 km2) *there were some small enclaves like ≈Ωepƒçe, Usora under Bosnian Croat control (400 km2) *eastern mountains were under Bosnian Serb control (100 km2) Tuzla Canton: *was largely under Bosniak control (2,544 km2) *there were some villages in Gradaƒçac municipality under Bosnian Croat control (5 km2) *and some villages in Doboj and Graƒçanica municipalities under Bosnian Serb control (100 km2) Posavina Canton: *was mostly under Bosnian Croat control (205 km2) *Bosnian Serbs controlled Od≈æak and parts of Domaljevac municipalities (120 km2) Bosnian Podrinje Canton: *was mostly under Bosniak control (405 km2) *Bosnian Serbs controlled areas which linked it with Sarajevo (100 km2) Sarajevo Canton: *was mostly under Bosnian Serbs control (800 km2) *while Bosniaks controlled some southern suburbs and most of the city itself (477 km2) Brƒçko District was divided; *Bosniaks controlled most of its southern parts (200 km2) *Bosnian Serbs its northern parts (193 km2) *While Bosnian Croats controlled the rest, part near Ora≈°je municipality and two enclaves on southern parts of municipality (100 km2) Appraisals The immediate purpose of the agreement was to freeze the military confrontation and prevent it from resuming. It was therefore defined as a \\"construction of necessity\\".Rory Keane, Reconstructing sovereignty. Post-Dayton Bosnia uncovered, London: Ashgate 2001, p. 61 The Dayton Agreement was aimed at allowing Bosnia and Herzegovina to move from an early post-conflict phase through reconstruction and consolidation, adopting a consociational power-sharing approach. Scholars such as Canadian professor Charles-Philippe David calls Dayton \\"the most impressive example of conflict resolution\\".Charles-Philippe David, \\"Alice in Wonderland meets Frankenstein: Constructivism, Realism and Peacebuilding in Bosnia\\", Contemporary Security Policy 22, No.1, 2001 American scholar Howard M. Hensel states that \\"Dayton represents an example of a conflict resolution negotiation that was successful. However, Patrice C. McMahon and Jon Western write that \\"As successful as Dayton was at ending the violence, it also sowed the seeds of instability by creating a decentralized political system that undermined the state's authority\\". Wolfgang Petritsch, OHR, argued in 2006 that the Dayton framework has allowed the international community to move \\"from statebuilding via institutions and capacity-building to identity building\\", putting Bosnia and Herzegovina \\"on the road to Brussels\\".Wolfgang Petritsch, \\"My lessons learnt in Bosnia and Herzegovina\\", Sarajevo, 2006 The Dayton Agreement has been the subject of criticism since its inception, including: * A complicated government system - As part of the Dayton agreement, Bosnia was divided into 2 entities and a government structure was created to appease all sides. However, by creating such a dissolved government, Bosnia has stalled in moving forward as every important issue is deadlocked within the central government as each party is championing opposing priorities that are based on ethnic policies and not shared ideals. * Dependency and control of international actors - Dayton was very much an international vision, led by the United States who supported an end to the war, but that did not allow Bosnian leaders to negotiate an ending to the war, therefore leaving no incentive in the afterward peacebuilding process and no area for leaders to discuss the underlying root causes of the conflict. International actors also played an extensive role in shaping the postwar agenda in Bosnia, including enacting punishment over local political actors. The influx of NGOs and international actors to kick start investment in the country post war also failed to kick start the economy, with Bosnia suffering from poor economic growth (2% in 2015). The lack of economic development has been attributed to poor coordination between international actors and lack of consideration for local capacity * Ending the war but not promoting peace - The primary aims of Dayton was to stop the war, but the agreement was only meant to be a temporary measure while a long term plan was developed. While Dayton has halted the conflict and there has not been a resurgence of violence, the stability in the conflict does not give an accurate assessment of peace. There is still currently a large military presence to mitigate any chance of violence and to enforce peace in the country. Enforcing such peace can be seen as highlighting the still deep rooted tensions in the country, with Dayton covering the cracks of a fractured society that could be plunged back into conflict as soon as military forces left. Disappearance of the original document On 13 February 2008, the head of the Presidency of Bosnia- Herzegovina ≈Ωeljko Kom≈°iƒá said that the original Dayton Agreement was lost from the Presidency's archive. High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina Miroslav Lajƒçak said: \\"I don't know whether the news is sad or funny\\". On 16 November 2009 the French Foreign Ministry delivered the certified copy of the Dayton agreement to the French embassy in Sarajevo. The copy was later transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The original was found in 2017 in a private residence in Pale, resulting in the arrest of one person.

According to the calculations of archaeologists, the Nabatean/Byzantine village of Shivta produced about two million liters of wine.\\"No sour grapes\\", Deborah Rubin Fields for The Jerusalem Post, 17 February 2011, partially accessed 5 August 2020 Adjacent to the site is a large farm that uses Nabatean agricultural techniques of irrigation, sowing and reaping. In the early 6th century, grape production in the Negev for the so-called vinum Gazentum ('Gaza wine' in Latin) experiences a major boom, due to the high demand for this product throughout Europe and the Middle East. This has been documented by studying ancient trash mounds at Shivta, Elusa and Nessana, which showed a sharp peak in the presence of grape pips and broken \\"Gaza jars\\" (a type of amphorae used in this period to export Levantine goods from the port of Gaza), following a slower rise during the fourth and fifth centuries. However, mid-century two major calamities strike the Byzantine Empire and large parts of the world: a short period of climate change known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-545), caused by huge volcanic eruptions in faraway places, which lead to extreme weather events; and in the 540s the first outbreak of bubonic plague in the Old World, known as the Justinianic Plague. Probably as a result of these two events, international trade with luxury goods such as Gaza wine almost grounded to a halt, and in Shivta and other Negev settlements grape production again gave way to subsistence farming, focused on barley and wheat. The previously widely accepted theory that the Muslim conquest, which came a century later, and the Muslim ban on alcoholic beverages were the cause for the decline of the wine industry in the Negev has been now proven wrong. In nearby Nessana, the number of grape pips is even on the rise again during the Early Islamic period, probably due to the needs of a local Christian monastery. This seems to indicate that the wine industry of the Negev could well be sustained over centuries through appropriate agricultural techniques and in spite of the arid climate, but that the grape monoculture was economically unsustainable in the long run. =Early Muslim period= After the Arab conquest in the 7th century CE, the population dwindled. Shivta was finally abandoned in the 8th or 9th century CE.

Biography Philip II himself briefly ruled parts of Syria in the 60s BC, as a client king under Pompey. He competed with his second cousin Antiochus XIII Asiaticus for the favours of the great Roman general, but Pompey would have none of them and had Antiochus murdered. No coins of Philip II are known, which is unusual for Seleucid rulers (the ephemeral Seleucus V Philometor is the only other king for whom this is the case). This may indicate that Philip did not rule in any of the mint cities. Philip may have survived his deposition: a Seleucid prince Philip is mentioned as a prospective bridegroom to queen Berenice IV of Egypt, sister of Cleopatra VII in 56 BC. The union was, however, checked by the Roman governor of Syria Aulus Gabinius who probably had Philip II killed. Philip himself was indeed an insignificant pawn, but with him ended eleven generations of Seleucid kings, arguably some of the most influential rulers of the Hellenistic world.

She studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially encouraged to work there by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey. Gorillas in the Mist, a book published two years before her death, is Fossey's account of her scientific study of the gorillas at Karisoke Research Center and prior career. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same name.Ware, Susan; Braukman, Stacy (2004). Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. pp. 220-1. . Fossey was one of the foremost primatologists in the world, a member of the \\"Trimates\\", a group formed of prominent female scientists originally sent by Leakey to study great apes in their natural environments, along with Jane Goodall who studied chimpanzees, and Birutƒó Galdikas, who studied orangutans. She spent 20 years in Rwanda, where she actively supported conservation efforts, strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats, and made more people acknowledge sapient gorillas. Fossey and her gorillas were victims of mobbing. Following the killing of a gorilla and subsequent tensions, she was murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985. Although Fossey's research assistant was convicted in absentia, there is no consensus as to who killed her. Her research and conservation work largely helped reduce the downward population trend in mountain gorillas, saving them from extinction. Early life Fossey was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Kathryn \\"Kitty\\" (n√©e Kidd), a fashion model, and George E. Fossey III, an insurance agent. Her parents divorced when she was six. Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost. Fossey's stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child. He would not allow Fossey to sit at the dining room table with him or her mother during dinner meals.Mowat, Farley. Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa.

Her love for animals began with her first pet goldfish and continued throughout her entire life. At age six, she began riding horses, earning a letter from her school; by her graduation in 1954, Fossey had established herself as an equestrienne. =Education and medical career= Fossey attended Lowell High School. Following the guidance of her stepfather, she enrolled in a business course at the College of Marin in San Francisco. However, spending her summer on a ranch in Montana at age 19 rekindled her love of animals, and she enrolled in a pre-veterinary course in biology at the University of California, Davis. In defiance of her stepfather's wishes for her to attend a business school, Dian decided to spend her professional life working with animals. Consequently, Dian's parents failed to give her any substantial amount of financial support throughout her adult life. She supported herself by working as a clerk at a White Front department store, doing other clerking and laboratory work, and laboring as a machinist in a factory. Although Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including chemistry and physics, and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to San Jose State College, where she became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville. Her shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital. Fossey became close with her coworker Mary White \\"Gaynee\\" Henry, secretary to the hospital's chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock on a daily basis and also experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life. During her free time she would pursue her love of horses. The Leakeys and the Congo=Journey to Africa= Louis and Mary Leakey on her first trip to Africa. Fossey turned down an offer to join the Henrys on an African tour due to lack of finances, but in 1963 she borrowed $8,000 (one year's salary), took out her life savings and went on a seven-week visit to Africa. In September 1963, she arrived in Nairobi, Kenya. While there, she met actor William Holden, owner of Treetops Hotel, who introduced her to her safari guide, John Alexander. Alexander became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rhodesia. Alexander's route included visits to Tsavo, Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of Manyara, famous for attracting giant flocks of flamingos; and the Ngorongoro Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife. The final two sites for her visit were Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (the archeological site of Louis and Mary Leakey); and Mt. Mikeno in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist George Schaller had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for hominid fossils. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of English primatologist Jane Goodall and the importance of long-term research on the great apes. Although Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys, by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in Uganda, the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers Joan and Alan Root. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas. After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in The Courier-Journal newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa. =Research in the Congo= Gorilla mother with cub in Virunga National Park in the Congo When Leakey made an appearance in Louisville while on a nationwide lecture tour, Fossey took the color supplements that had appeared about her African trip in The Courier-Journal to show to Leakey, who remembered her and her interest in mountain gorillas. Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as Jane Goodall had with chimpanzees in Tanzania. Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa. After studying Swahili and auditing a class on primatology during the eight months it took to get her visa and funding, Fossey arrived in Nairobi in December 1966. With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped Land Rover which she named \\"Lily\\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the Gombe Stream Research Centre to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees. Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the Virunga Mountains, Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier. Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to \\"Lily\\" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock. Fossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant. She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children. Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \\"noseprints\\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera. Fossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the Belgian Congo until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu, by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the Congo Crisis. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the Kivu Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at Rumangabo for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumg√§rtel's Travellers Rest Hotel in Kisoro, where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military. Advised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against US Embassy advice to restart her study on the Rwandan side of the Virungas. In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate Rosamond Carr, who introduced her to Belgian local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local's knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study. Conservation work in Rwanda Fossey established her research camp on the foothills of Mount Bisoke. On September 24, 1967, Fossey founded the Karisoke Research Center, a remote rainforest camp nestled in Ruhengeri province in the saddle of two volcanoes. For the research center's name, Fossey used \\"Kari\\" for the first four letters of Mount Karisimbi that overlooked her camp from the south, and \\"soke\\" for the last four letters of Mount Bisoke, the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind camp. Established up Mount Bisoke, the defined study area covered . She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, or Nyiramacibiri, roughly translated as \\"The woman who lives alone on the mountain.\\" Unlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as poachers, and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance. Fossey attempted to habituate the gorillas by copying their actions. Over time the gorillas became accustomed to Fossey. As she explained to the BBC in 1984: \\"I'm an inhibited persona and I felt that the gorillas were somewhat inhibited as well, so I imitated their natural, normal behaviour like feeding, munching on celery stalks or scratching myself\\" Fossey made discoveries about gorillas including how females transfer from group to group over the decades, gorilla vocalization, hierarchies and social relationships among groups, rare infanticide, gorilla diet, and how gorillas recycle nutrients. Fossey's research was funded by the Wilkie Foundation and the Leakey Home, with primary funding from the National Geographic Society. In 1970, she appeared on the cover of National Geographic Magazine, which brought tremendous attention to her work. Fossey was often hostile to Africans who entered into the protected area, even shooting roaming cattle. By 1980, Fossey, who had obtained her PhD at Cambridge University in the UK, was recognized as the world's leading authority on the physiology and behavior of mountain gorillas, defining gorillas as being \\"dignified, highly social, gentle giants, with individual personalities, and strong family relationships.\\" Fossey lectured as professor at Cornell University in 1981‚Äì83. Her bestselling book Gorillas in the Mist was praised by Nikolaas Tinbergen, the Dutch ethologist and ornithologist who won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Her book remains the best-selling book about gorillas. Many research students left after not being able to handle the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually had to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete. =Opposition to poaching= A frozen baby gorilla confiscated from poachers While hunting had been illegal in the national park of the Virunga Volcanoes in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by poachers and paid a salary less than Fossey's own African staff. On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas' deaths. Through the Digit Fund, Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity. The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period. In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's elephants for ivory and killed more than a dozen gorillas. Fossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences. In 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the zoo in Cologne, Germany. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed. The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the Virunga Volcanoes for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to a semblance of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month. She viewed the holding of animals in \\"prison\\" (zoos) for the entertainment of people as unethical.Fossey, Dian : Gorillas in the Mist. 1983 While gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the silverback of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator. Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of gangrene, from being brushed by a poacher's bullet. According to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the World Wildlife Fund, African Wildlife Foundation, Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the Mount Sabyinyo area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation. The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti- poaching and bushmeat hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \\"to pay the airfare of so- called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \\"active conservation\\" or the international conservation groups' \\"theoretical conservation.\\" =Killing of Digit and escalating tensions= The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in Rwanda Sometime during the day on New Year's Eve 1977, Fossey's favorite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking antelope traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defense and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape. Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for ashtrays. He was twelves years old. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned. Fossey later described Digit's killing as the \\"saddest event in all my years of sharing the daily lives of mountain gorilla.\\" The event plunged Fossey into depression. She isolated herself in her cabin, consuming large amounts of alcohol and cigarettes. Fossey subsequently created the Digit Fund (now the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in the US)This organization is unaffiliated with the Gorilla Organization in the UK, which uses Dian's name although it no longer funded her work after Digit's death. to raise money for anti-poaching patrols. In addition, a consortium of international gorilla funds arose to accept donations in light of Digit's death and increased attention on poaching. Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organizations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place. The deaths of some of her most studied gorillas caused Fossey to devote more of her attention to preventing poaching and less on scientific publishing and research. Fossey became more intense in protecting the gorillas and began to employ more direct tactics: she and her staff cut animal traps almost as soon as they were set; frightened, captured and humiliated the poachers; held their cattle for ransom; burned their hunting camps and even mats from their houses. Fossey was reported to have captured and held Rwandans she suspected of poaching. She allegedly beat a poacher's testicles with stinging nettles.Washington Post, Gorillas in the mist film review Retrieved 16 January 2014. In a letter to a friend, she wrote, \\"We stripped him and spread eagled him and lashed the holy blue sweat out of him with nettle stalks and leaves‚Ä¶\\" She even reportedly kidnapped and held for ransom the child of a suspected poacher. After her murder, Fossey's National Geographic editor, Mary Smith, told Shlachter that on visits to the United States, Fossey would \\"load up on firecrackers, cheap toys and magic tricks as part of her method to mystify the (Africans) in order to hold them at bay.\\"Shlachter, Barry. \\"A Neighborhood Feud? The strange life and gruesome death of Dian Fossey\\", July 8, 1986, Boston Phoenix She wore face-masks and pretended to practice black magic to scare away poachers. Writing in The Wall Street Journal in 2002, the journalist Tunku Varadarajan described Fossey at the end of her life as colorful, controversial, and \\"a racist alcoholic who regarded her gorillas as better than the African people who lived around them\\". Death=Murder= Fossey's grave at Karisoke, alongside those of her gorilla friends In the early morning of December 27, 1985, Fossey was discovered murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at the far edge of the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda. Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that \\"when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow.\\" The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor. Her cabin had been ransacked. However, robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks. The last entry in her diary read: Fossey is buried at Karisoke, in a site that she herself had constructed for her deceased gorilla friends. She was buried in the gorilla graveyard next to Digit, and near many gorillas killed by poachers. Memorial services were also held in New York City, Washington, D.C. and California. =Aftermath= After Fossey's death, her entire staff was arrested. This included Rwandan Emmanuel Rwelekana, a tracker who had been fired from his job after he allegedly tried to kill Fossey with a machete, according to the government's account of McGuire's trial. All were later released, except Rwelekana, who was later found dead in prison, supposedly having hanged himself. Rwandan courts later tried and convicted Wayne McGuire in absentia for her murder. The alleged motive was that McGuire murdered Fossey in order to steal the manuscript of the sequel to her 1983 book, Gorillas in the Mist. At the trial, investigators said McGuire was not happy with his own research and wanted to use \\"any dishonest means possible\\" to complete his work. McGuire had returned to the United States in July 1987, and because no extradition treaty exists between the U.S. and Rwanda, McGuire did not return to Rwanda. His penalty was death by shooting. Following his return to the U.S., McGuire gave a brief statement at a news conference in Century City, Los Angeles, saying Fossey had been his \\"friend and mentor\\", calling her death \\"tragic\\" and the charges \\"outrageous\\". Thereafter, McGuire was largely absent from public notice until 2005, when news broke that he had been accepted for a job with the Health and Human Services division of the State of Nebraska. The job offer was revoked upon discovery of his relation to the Fossey case. Several subsequent books, including Farley Mowat's biography of Fossey, Woman in the Mists (New York, NY: Warner Books, 1987), have suggested alternative theories regarding her murder, including intimations that she may have been killed by financial interests linked to tourism or illicit trade. It has been alleged that Fossey had potentially damning evidence of gold-smugglers, hence the ransacked cabin. A will purporting to be Fossey's bequeathed all of her estate (including the proceeds from the film Gorillas in the Mist) to the Digit Fund to underwrite anti-poaching patrols. Fossey did not mention her family in the will, which was unsigned. Her mother, Hazel Fossey Price, successfully challenged the will. New York State Supreme Court Justice Swartwood threw out the will and awarded the estate to her mother, including about $4.9 million in royalties from a recent book and upcoming movie, stating that the document \\"was simply a draft of her purported will and not a will at all.\\" Price said she was working on a project to preserve the work her daughter had done for the mountain gorillas in Rwanda.AP News Report. (January 15, 1988). Ruling On Fossey's Will' Personal life and views Darwin College at Cambridge. During her African safari, Fossey met Alexie Forrester, the brother of a Rhodesian she had been dating in Louisville; Fossey and Forrester later became engaged. In her later years, Fossey became involved with National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell after a year of working together at Karisoke, with Campbell promising to leave his wife. Eventually the pair grew apart through her dedication to the gorillas and Karisoke, along with his need to work further afield and on his marriage. In 1970, studying for her Ph.D. at Darwin College, University of Cambridge, she discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion, later commenting that \\"you can't be a cover girl for National Geographic magazine and be pregnant.\\" She graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology in 1976. Fossey had other relationships throughout the years and always had a love for children. Since Fossey would rescue any abused or abandoned animal she saw in Africa or near Karisoke, she acquired a menagerie in the camp, including a monkey who lived in her cabin, Kima, and a dog, Cindy. Fossey held Christmas parties every year for her researchers, staffers, and their families, and she developed a genuine friendship with Jane Goodall. =Health= Fossey had been plagued by lung problems from an early age and, later in her life, suffered from advanced emphysema brought on by years of heavy cigarette smoking. As the debilitating disease progressed‚Äîfurther aggravated by the high mountain altitude and damp climate‚ÄîFossey found it increasingly difficult to conduct field research, frequently suffering from shortness of breath and requiring the help of an oxygen tank when climbing or hiking long distances. =Opposition to tourism= Fossey strongly opposed wildlife tourism, as gorillas are very susceptible to human anthroponotic diseases like influenza for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior. Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior. Today, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat. Legacy After her death, Fossey's Digit Fund in the US was renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Karisoke Research Center is operated by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, and continues the daily gorilla monitoring and protection that she started. Fossey is generally credited with reversing the downward trend in the mountain gorilla population. Due to poaching, gorilla populations declined from 450 in 1960 to just 250 in 1981. However, Fossey's \\"war on poaching\\" saw the final confirmed killing of a gorilla in 1983. By the late 1980s, the population had grown to 280. It continues to grow. Fossey's research, and the following publicity, spawned \\"gorilla tourism\\". Between Fossey's death and the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Karisoke was directed by former students, some of whom had opposed her. During the genocide and subsequent period of insecurity, the camp was completely looted and destroyed. Today only remnants are left of her cabin. During the civil war, the Virunga National Park was filled with refugees, and illegal logging destroyed vast areas. In 2014, the 82nd anniversary of Fossey's birth was commemorated by a Google Doodle. =In media= Fossey was portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in Gorillas in the Mist (1988) Universal Studios bought the film rights to Gorillas in the Mist from Fossey in 1985, and Warner Bros. Studios bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by Rosamond Carr. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film Gorillas in the Mist, starring Sigourney Weaver, Bryan Brown, and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer Bob Campbell. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by Bryan Brown) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home. In December 2017, Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist, a three-hour series, aired on the National Geographic Channel. The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage, and reconstruction.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 21, 1990. In this episode, Homer becomes a crusader for safety in Springfield and is promoted to safety inspector at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and was the first Simpsons script to be completed, although it was the third episode produced. Plot Mrs. Krabappel takes Bart's class on a field trip to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Distracted when Bart waves at him, Homer crashes an electric cart into a cooling vent and is fired. Homer searches for a new job without success. Feeling like a failure, he writes a note to his family and decides to commit suicide by attaching a boulder to himself and jumping off a bridge. Lisa finds Homer's note and alerts the family. They hurry to the bridge to save him, but they are almost run over by a speeding truck. Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly filled with a new reason to live: to place a stop sign at the dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and warning signs throughout the town. Unsatisfied with his own efforts, Homer takes on the biggest danger in Springfield, the nuclear power plant. After Homer rallies people to his cause, Mr. Burns decides to end the furor he is creating by offering him a new position as the plant safety inspector, along with a higher salary. Homer, torn between his principles and his livelihood, tearfully tells his followers that they must fight their battles alone from this point on and takes the job. Production \\"Black Smithers\\", as seen in this episode Waylon Smithers makes his first appearance in this episode, although he can be heard over a speaker in the series premiere.Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire BBC.co.uk. Retrieved on March 2, 2007, In his first visual appearance, he was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made an African American by Gy√∂rgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be \\"Mr. Burns' white sycophant\\", and the staff thought it \\"would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character\\" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Smithers' skin tone was later explained as an \\"extreme tan\\". Blinky the Three-Eyed Fish makes a brief cameo in this episode; he later becomes of importance in episode four of the second season, \\"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\\". Also notable is that Marge was originally called Juliette in this script as a homage to Romeo and Juliet. Homer's middle initial, J, is mentioned for the first time in this episode. According to Matt Groening, it was a reference to Bullwinkle J. Moose. Additionally, the following characters made their first appearances in this episode: Otto Mann, Chief Wiggum, Jasper Beardley, Sam & Larry, Mr. & Mrs. Winfield and Sherri and Terri. The episode's title comes from the Greek epic poem Odyssey, traditionally attributed to the legendary poet Homer. On the bus, Bart sings \\"John Henry was a Steel Driving Man\\", an American folk- song about a 19th-century hero of the working-class, building railroads across the West Virginia mountains. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Homer's Odyssey\\" finished twenty-eight in ratings for the week of January 15‚Äì21, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9, equivalent to approximately 13.7 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said that \\"the story rather fizzles out at the end, but there are many good moments, especially in the power plant\\". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode is \\"possibly the best of the [first six] shows\\" and that it \\"suffers a little from an odd tone, as the characters hadn't become settled. Still, it seems surprisingly clever and witty.\\" In September 2001, in a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated the episode (of 5) and called it \\"the first season at its worst\\", continuing that it was \\"notable for introducing Mr. Burns and (a strangely African-American) Smithers, but otherwise boring and preachy\\". Home release The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled The Simpsons Collection, in which it was paired with the sixth episode of the season, \\"Moaning Lisa\\". In the United Kingdom, it was once re released as part of VHS boxed set of the complete first season, released in November 1999. In the United States, the episode would finally see the home video release as a part of The Simpsons Season One DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Archer, Kogen, and Wolodarsky participated in the DVD's audio commentary. A digital edition of the series' first season was published December 20, 2010 in the United States containing the episode, through Amazon Video and iTunes.

The band's music spans a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. They are known for extensive use of segues in live performances, and were considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival. Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla, and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999. While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \\"Run-Around\\", \\"Hook\\", and \\"But Anyway\\". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album, four, released in 1994 and became a sleeper hit almost a year later. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with obesity put a damper on the group's success, and A&M; dropped the band in 2002. In the years following, the band has bounced around through a succession of independent labels and record producers, and gotten increasingly experimental with their recorded output. Blues Traveler's latest album, Hurry Up and Hang Around, was released in the fall of 2018. History=Formation= The genesis of Blues Traveler was as a high school garage band formed in Princeton, New Jersey in the mid-1980s. Harmonicist, singer and guitarist John Popper and drummer Brendan Hill formed a group they called The Establishment (later renamed Blues Band) with Hill's brother on bass and a rotating roster of guitarists. The band produced a few cassette tape demos. In addition to some original songs, their repertoire included upbeat covers of \\"Gloria\\" and \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". The group added guitarist and football player Chan Kinchla. Although he was a promising athlete, Kinchla decided to commit to playing music instead after a knee injury. Popper met bassist Bobby Sheehan and the two became good friends, with Sheehan becoming the new bass player for Blues Band in 1987. The quartet held a basement jam session (later christened The Black Cat Jam) which spawned the core grooves for several songs on their first album. A black cat happened to be nearby, and the group took this as a sign and adopted the Black Cat as their mascot figure. The group changed their name to Blues Traveler, taking the latter part from the name of the primary demon in the film Ghostbusters, Gozer the Traveler. =Early years= After graduating Princeton High School and moving to New York City, Popper, Hill, and Sheehan enrolled in the music program at The New School while Kinchla attended New York University. After much encouragement by friend David Gonzales, Blues Traveler began playing gigs along the New York-area club circuit, sometimes nightly; the most prominent contract was playing Wednesday nights at a club called the Wetlands. Another bar, The Nightingale, was a regular gig, and later became the setting for the song \\"Defense and Desire\\". The group shared an apartment on Bergen Street in Brooklyn, New York, along with their high school friend, singer Chris Barron. A second band that Popper and Hill founded, called The Trucking Company, soon became The Spin Doctors with Barron as their frontman. The two groups would often share the stage, playing non-stop concerts of multiple sets. Their first show together was at a Columbia University fraternity party and their second was at a Jamaican-themed restaurant near Times Square in New York City. During this time, Blues Traveler acquired a devout follower, Gina-Z (subject of the band's song \\"Gina\\") who first became an unofficial \\"band mom\\" and later a tour manager, and is involved with the group's business to the present day. At one New York show they were discovered by an A&M; Records talent scout, Patrick Clifford, and the band signed their first recording contract. By 1990 all members had dropped out of college classes. The group also attracted the attention of David Graham, son of the world-famous concert promoter Bill Graham, and David Graham became the group's manager. Blues Traveler then started a relentless touring schedule, expanding their reach up and down the east coast. =First albums= Blues Traveler released their self-titled debut album in 1990, with the song \\"But Anyway\\" getting airplay on college radio stations. The album included Joan Osborne on backing vocals on two tracks. A second album, Travelers and Thieves, followed in 1991. Upon Bill Graham's death that year, they released a live EP, On Tour Forever, as a tribute to Graham, which featured guitarist Carlos Santana. Around this time, the mainstream national audience was exposed to Blues Traveler by television host David Letterman, who has introduced them as \\"[his] favorite band\\". The band has since made more appearances on The Late Show than any musical artist. Letterman's band leader Paul Shaffer has played on a number of Blues Traveler recordings. In 1992, the group founded the H.O.R.D.E. festival as an alternative to others such as Lollapalooza, along with other bands such as Phish and Spin Doctors. Blues Traveler began recording their third album, Save His Soul. Recording was temporarily interrupted by John Popper's motorcycle accident, although the band resumed touring shortly thereafter with Popper in a wheelchair. Two singles were released from the album, \\"Defense & Desire\\" and \\"Conquer Me\\", which reached No. 34 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. =Mainstream breakthrough= The band's fourth album, titled four, was produced by the team of Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson and released in late 1994. The upbeat pop single \\"Run-Around\\" became the group's first chart hit followed by the \\"Hook\\". \\"Run-Around\\" won a Grammy Award and broke a record for most weeks on the chart. Blues Traveler appeared at Woodstock '94 and later became an opening act for The Rolling Stones. The band played on the 1995 season premiere of Saturday Night Live as a last-minute replacement for Prince. They were featured in an episode of the sitcom Roseanne, and later recorded the show's theme song for its final season. The 1996 comedy film Kingpin featured the group playing their song \\"But Anyway\\" during the closing credits. The group recorded the Johnny Rivers song \\"Secret Agent Man\\" for the film Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls at Icon Recording Studios in St. Louis, Missouri and the Bob Seger song \\"Get Out of Denver\\" for the film Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, as well as Fats Domino's \\"I'm Walkin'\\" for Rebel Highway: Cool and the Crazy. Several previously recorded Blues Traveler songs were included on film soundtracks, including The Last Seduction, Speed, Very Bad Things, White Man's Burden, and The Truth About Cats & Dogs. The band also appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000 and on its soundtrack, playing \\"Maybe I'm Wrong\\", an original composition with a classic blues-rock sound. Blues Traveler recorded the Sly & the Family Stone song \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\" for the NORML compilation album Hempilation and the John Lennon song \\"Imagine\\" for the Lennon tribute album Working Class Hero. The original song \\"Christmas\\" was included on the benefit album A Very Special Christmas 3. The double live album, Live from the Fall, was released in 1996. It featured recordings from the band's autumn 1995 concerts and showcased the strength of the band's live performances. The next studio album, Straight On till Morning, also produced by Barbiero/Thompson, was released in 1997. It achieved platinum status, reaching number 11 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, but did not perform as well as four. The single \\"Carolina Blues\\" peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. By the end of 1998, the band had prepared a concept album called The Sun, The Storm and The Traveler, based on Aesop's fable of The North Wind and the Sun, and they planned to record it after a recess in the fall of 1999. That summer, John Popper had emergency heart surgery due to artery blockage, forcing the band to cancel their annual July 4th Red Rocks shows at the last minute. During the hiatus, Popper released a solo album with a backing band consisting of Dave Matthews Band drummer Carter Beauford and members of the group Cycomotogoat. The band made an appearance performing as themselves in the 1998 movie Blues Brothers 2000 and the 1999 independent film Wildflowers, which had been filmed a couple of years earlier. =Sheehan's death and new lineup= On August 20, 1999, Bobby Sheehan was found dead in his New Orleans, Louisiana home, where he had been recording music with some friends the night before. Sheehan's death was ruled an accidental drug overdose, with cocaine, Valium, and heroin found in his system. The remaining members of Blues Traveler convened and agreed that Sheehan would have wanted them to continue as a band. Auditions for a new bassist were held in concert, and included Chan Kinchla's younger brother Tad, who was unanimously determined to be the best choice for the role. Additionally, an open call was sent for a permanent keyboard player, a role of which Sheehan had often been a proponent. In January 2000, Ben Wilson of the jump blues band Big Dave & the Ultrasonics was chosen, and has since become a central contributor to the band's songwriting. The band discarded their concept album material, instead releasing a smaller online EP, Decisions of the Sky: A Traveler's Tale of Sun and Storm, and went to work collectively composing a new set of songs with the new lineup. The resulting album was Bridge, which had the working title Bridge Outta Brooklyn as a tribute to Sheehan (with both the acronym B.O.B. and his nickname \\"Brooklyn Bobby\\"). The songs \\"Girl Inside My Head\\" and \\"Just for Me\\" received airplay, but the album's sales fell somewhat short of expectations. The live album What You and I Have Been Through and the compilation Travelogue: Blues Traveler Classics were both released in 2002. =Independent years= Blues Traveler in 2008 Blues Traveler were one of dozens of artists who were jettisoned as part of A&M;'s corporate restructuring. The band signed with Sanctuary Records for their next album, Truth Be Told, which achieved number 147 on The Top 200 chart. The band's 2003 Independence Day concerts at Red Rocks Amphitheatre were released on the CD Live on the Rocks and the DVD Thinnest of Air, and include Ziggy Marley singing on his father's song \\"No Woman, No Cry\\". The band left Sanctuary for Vanguard Records and released ¬°Bastardos!, which was produced by Wilco's Jay Bennett and was touted as the band's return to music that they wanted to play. The album charted at 49 on the Independent Albums, and a live EP of songs from the album was released to independent record stores. The group recorded \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" for the 2007 tribute album Endless Highway: The Music of The Band, as well as \\"Free Bird\\" for Under the Influence: A Jam Band Tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd. Blues Traveler have been featured on VH1's Behind the Music, A&E;'s Private Sessions, and Austin City Limits. The group recorded the title track to the Sandra Boynton children's album Dog Train, which was also used as the promotional music for the American Kennel Club's National Championship event. The band's music has been used in video games (NASCAR 2000) and commercials (Busch Beer). The songs \\"Business as Usual\\" and \\"Money Back Guarantee\\" are used as transitional music on the public radio finance program Marketplace and its sister show Marketplace Money. In 2007, Blues Traveler released the album Cover Yourself, a \\"best-of\\" album of previously released songs re-recorded and reinterpreted with acoustic instrumentation. It was released October 30, 2007 through Columbia/Red Ink Records. They did a national tour, with New Jersey-based singer/songwriter Lisa Bouchelle as opening act. After the tour John Popper and Lisa Bouchelle recorded the song \\"Only The Tequila Talking\\", which was released on her album Bleu Room with a Red Vase in 2010. Blues Traveler appeared at the 2008 Lollapalooza festival. At their June 2008 shows, the band debuted new songs off their new album North Hollywood Shootout (album). The album, which features a guest appearance by Bruce Willis, released in August 2008. 2010s In March 2012, Blues Traveler released a double-disc compilation titled 25 on Hip-O Records; the album commemorates the band's silver anniversary and includes their hit singles, new covers, and previously unreleased B-side material. It peaked at No. 49 in Canada. The following studio album, Suzie Cracks the Whip, was released on June 26 of that year. In September 2013, Blues Traveler signed with Las Vegas-based management firm, UD Factory. On April 7, 2015, the band released their twelfth studio album, Blow Up the Moon which peaked at No. 29 on Independent Albums and No. 47 on Top Rock Albums Billboard charts. As part of the album's promotion album, Blues Traveler released a music video using Rockstar editor in Grand Theft Auto V on September 14, 2015. The music video features JC Chasez and 3OH!3. In 2016, Blues Traveler made a cameo appearance in the film The Meddler. On December 7 the group released a cover version of \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\". In April 2017 the band announced a five-week U.S. tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the group's formation. In May, social posts, and a video piece on Keyboard Magazine confirmed that of the band in the studio in Nashville, TN with record producer Matt Rollings. The album Hurry Up & Hang Around was released on 12 October 2018 through BMG. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Blues Traveler among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.  Concert recordings  Blues Traveler allows and encourages fans to record and trade live performances, provided that no money changes hands and no profit is made. The band has also given permission for live fan-made recordings to be hosted on websites such as Live Music Archive and eTree.org. Recordings available there span from 1986 through the present day. On more recent tours, they sell recordings of that very night's performance. Attendees can pre-purchase a copy of the show until 30 minutes into the performance and then pick up the CD after the show.  Independence Day shows at Red Rocks  Every year since 1994, with the exception of 1999 and 2020, Blues Traveler has headlined a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado on the American Independence Day, July 4. The band usually plays two consecutive nights, starting on July 3. This tradition started in 1992 when Blues Traveler was opening for The Allman Brothers Band at the venue for two nights, July 3 and 4. The next year, the band booked the HORDE festival to play there on Independence Day, and in 1994 the current tradition began in earnest. These shows attract fans from all over the United States. The band frequently debuts new songs and brings back older songs, fallen out of rotation. The 2003 Independence Day concerts were recorded for a home video and live album release.

He initially gained fame in the 1990s for his ability to freestyle, and eventually released his debut album Can-I-Bus in 1998. Since releasing his debut album, Canibus has gone on to release 13 solo studio albums in total, as well as multiple collaboration albums and EPs with other rappers as a member of The Hrsmn, Sharpshooterz, Cloak N Dagga, The Undergods and one-half of T.H.E.M.

The New York Times. Accessed February 22, 2008. Music career=Early career (1992‚Äì1996)= He began rhyming in the early '90s and by 1992 under the name Canibus Sativa, and formed a duo called T.H.E.M. (The Heralds of Extreme Metaphors) with Atlanta rapper Webb (now called C.I., also known as Central Intelligence). In 1996, T.H.E.M. split and Canibus teamed with businessman Charles Suitt. That same year Charles Suitt introduced Canibus to platinum producer Frankie Cutlass and the two collaborated on a song. Canibus also appeared on the Music Makes Me High remix by the Lost Boyz featuring Tha Dogg Pound making it Canibus' first official appearance on a record. In December 1997, Canibus first publicly discussed a verbal confrontation with LL Cool J in an interview with Tour√® for The Village Voice. Also attending the interview was John Fort√©, DMX, Big Pun, Mos Def and Mic Geronimo. The roundtable discussion was recorded by Kurt Nice and featured in Shades of Hip Hop compilation Hot 2 Def in 1998 and re- released in 2004 on Shades of Hip Hop: The Cypher. =Debut album (1997‚Äì1998)= Canibus' debut album Can-I-Bus was released on September 8, 1998. The song \\"Second Round K.O.\\", produced by Wyclef Jean, was a success, with the video featuring Wyclef and a cameo appearance by boxer Mike Tyson. Despite eventually being certified Gold, critics panned the album, criticizing both Canibus's subject matter and Wyclef's beats, most of which were considered inferior to both \\"Second Round K.O.\\" and the artists' previous collaborations. The album contained a lot of socially-conscious material, such as corruption within the U.S. government, AIDS, and violence in modern America. Canibus had a feud with LL Cool J over a verse that Canibus gave on LL's track \\"4,3,2,1\\" from his album Phenomenon. The track featured Canibus, Method Man, Redman, and DMX. Canibus's verse began with the line \\"Yo LL, is that a mic on your arm? Let me borrow that,\\" referring to the microphone tattoo on LL Cool J's arm which LL Cool J interpreted as Canibus insulting him. When the final cut of the song came out it featured LL Cool J's verse after Canibus's, mocking an unspecified person believed to be Canibus. =Wyclef feud, second album (1999‚Äì2000)= Because Wyclef produced the majority of the tracks on Can-I-Bus, Williams blamed him for the general dissatisfaction with Can-I-Bus and cut ties with him, going as far as to diss Wyclef, most notably on the title track of his second album (\\"You mad at the last album? I apologize for it / Yo, I can't call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it!\\"). Said album, 2000 B.C., was also released to mixed feelings and reviews‚Äîthe latter once more focusing on the lack of topical variety and uninspired production‚Äîand also suffered from very little promotion by Universal Records. 2000 B.C. featured the first collaboration between Canibus and Kurupt, Ras Kass and Killah Priest, a rap supergroup collectively known as The HRSMN (referring to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse), on the track \\"Horsementality\\". Though following 2000 B.C.'s release it had been announced that the group would be releasing an album, these plans never materialized, with only an EP of outtakes from 2001 entitled The Horsemen Project released by Killah Priest's management in 2003. Since 2000, however, the members of the group have worked together on various songs and rumors of a full-length HRSMN album have persisted and include speculation about collaborations with Pharoahe Monch, Common and Rakim, among others. Wyclef Jean would respond to Canibus's earlier remark on the track \\"However You Want It\\" from his album, The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book. Though much bitterness between Canibus and Wyclef Jean remained for a period of time, the two artists finally settled their differences at the end of 2004; they have since worked together on two remixes of the Machel Montano song \\"Carnival Survivors\\". In an interview with HipHopsite.com conducted in November 2005, Williams revealed that he had recorded five songs with Wyclef and Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis at Platinum Studios in New York for the upcoming Fugees reunion album. Whether or not those recordings will appear on the album has not been determined yet. =C True Hollywood Stories (2001)= In 2001, Canibus released his third album, C True Hollywood Stories, the title and some of the content deriving from the television show E! True Hollywood Story. It was released on Archives Music, an independent label owned by Williams' future business partner, Louis Lombard III. It was a controversial release due to the album's overall concept, which to this day remains quite unclear to some. Many listeners interpreted it as Canibus' botched attempt at becoming a commercial and mainstream artist and wrote him off as a one-hit wonder, while others have called it a concept album in which the rapper satirized the mainstream hip-hop scene. Most explanations since the album's release seem to lean towards the latter; when Canibus' new official website, MicClub.net, appeared online towards the end of 2002, the summary of C True Hollywood Stories in the \\"Merchandise\\" section called it \\"an introspective look into the ultimate fan \\"Stan's\\" take on the current state of hip hop\\". In an interview conducted in 2005, Williams' former promoter, Pak- Man, who worked on over half of the album with the rapper, spoke on the record, with his explanation leaning toward the album being intended as satire: \\"At that time Canibus was in the studio recording a lot of songs and [I] mean a lot, but he didn't want to make the fans wait no more so he did C True Hollywood Stories and he wanted to have fun wit, so thats what we did we had fun wit\\". In an interview on AllHipHop.com posted on April 8, 2005, Williams was asked what direction he was trying to take with that album; in his response, he stated \\"That album depicts the state of affairs in my life at the time ‚Äì nothing more, nothing less\\". =Mic Club: The Curriculum and Rip the Jacker (2002‚Äì2003)= After the critical failure of C True Hollywood Stories, Canibus was subject to criticism and ridicule from the rap industry until the release of Mic Club: The Curriculum, his fourth full-length album, towards the end of 2002. Although the production was handled almost entirely by little-known producers, some of them from Europe, the record proved to be a greater critical success than the previous year's release. Mic Club also saw Canibus return to a more complex rapping style, with a number of concept tracks and few songs with a chorus. The album was released on Mic Club Music, Canibus' own label, but failed to chart, selling relatively few copies. Following the release of Mic Club: The Curriculum, it was announced that Williams decided to join the United States Army. Before commencing his work with the military, however, he recorded a number of tracks which he intended to be released on his next album, entitled Rip the Jacker. Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind was given the task of producing the entire record, equipped solely with Canibus' pre-recorded vocals. Due to his military obligations, Canibus himself only managed to review the album after having acquired a copy. Upon release, Rip the Jacker received rave reviews from the majority of critics, who noted that Williams' largely scientific lyrics and distinctive, rough delivery was finally matched by equally fine production, as Canibus had a history of working with badly selected producers. Unlike Mic Club, Rip the Jacker charted on both Billboard's R&B;/hip-hop charts and the Billboard 200, peaking at #34 and #197, respectively, although commercially, it retained the tendency to sell few copies. Critics highlighted various aspects of Rip the Jacker's originality, both in terms of beats and lyrics; Stoupe had employed a large number of samples from often obscure compositions, while Canibus himself undertook a variety of topics from various perspectives. Of note was the inclusion of \\"Poet Laureate II\\", a song exceeding seven minutes in length and lacking a chorus, with several changes of beat throughout; the track was frequently singled out as one of the strongest in Canibus' career and the album as a whole convinced listeners and the industry alike that the rapper had not lost his potential. His very next album, Mind Control, would receive him no acclaim whatsoever and was seen as a huge step backwards for the rapper, and would be the start of what is considered to be a downward slope for him. =Mind Control, Cloak n Dagga and Hip-Hop for Sale (2005‚Äì2006)= Following Rip the Jacker and Canibus' subsequent discharge from the army, an album entitled Mind Control (2005) was released to negative reviews. Canibus had never planned for it to be compiled as a separate record, but agreed to release it through the independent Gladiator Music label as part of a contractual agreement; most of the vocals for Mind Control had been recorded prior to the release of C True Hollywood Stories. A collection of previously recorded material (with only three of the songs being unreleased) produced entirely by Mark Sparks, the album failed to chart and is rarely considered an official Canibus release by the rapper's fans. Also in 2005, a collaboration between Williams and underground rapper Phoenix Orion, who had also been known for scientific lyrics, yielded the album Def Con Zero, released on the independent Head Trauma Records label, owned by K-1 kickboxer Dewey Cooper. The record featured guest appearances from Kool G Rap, K-Solo, and former 106 & Park host Free, among others. As Cloak N Dagga, the duo briefly toured the United States promoting the release. The following month, after numerous delays, Canibus' seventh solo album, Hip-Hop for Sale, was released, but was panned by critics, who dismissed it as yet another failed attempt to gain mainstream recognition. Additionally, due to the earlier release of Mind Control and the leaking of most of the material in the form of a mixtape entitled The Vitruvian Man, the release date had been pushed back to November, the original date having been May. The production on Hip-Hop for Sale was handled in part by Virginia-based producer Nottz, with several relatively unknown producers handling the remaining tracks after Nottz had cut ties with Canibus due to the appearance of The Vitruvian Man.The day of Hip-Hop for Sale's release, Mic Club Master Volume One, a separate mixtape, appeared in stores, many of the songs receiving more praise than those present on the full-length album. =For Whom the Beat Tolls (2007)= In January 2007, it was announced that Canibus would release new material in 2007 exclusively on his own imprint, Mic Club Music, in a joint venture with Legion Entertainment and distributed via his former major label, Universal Music Group. A pair of mixtapes, titled Nothing to Prove and Nothing to Lose, were slated for release in March 2007, but were eventually scrapped; instead, Canibus decided to use the best material from each mixtape to create a new full-length album entitled For Whom the Beat Tolls. When the record was originally announced in March, there was only one confirmed track ‚Äì the third installment in Canibus' \\"Poet Laureate\\" series, \\"Poet Laureate Infinity\\". The track has 1,000 bars, in the form of five 200 bar verses, and is layered in such a way that \\"when you mix it and spread it throughout five channels, [you have the ability] to mix the track differently every time\\".Heinzelman, Bill (March 19, 2007). Canibus My Life . XXL magazine. Accessed March 24, 2008. On April 8, 2007, the track was uploaded, by Canibus himself, to a website where the listener could mix the track differently on a digital mixing board. The website is now down, but the fansite Canibus-Central.com provided a backup. \\"For Whom the Beat Tolls\\" was originally set for release in May 2007, but was pushed back one month, and a released on June 12, 2007 (though it was not distributed by Universal as previously reported). The album has 16 tracks and includes contributions from Killah Priest and Vinnie Paz, among others, and featured two personally made mixes of the \\"Poet Laureate Infinity\\" track (\\"Poet Laureate Infinity v003\\" and \\"Poet Laureate Infinity v004\\"). Following the release of \\"For Whom the Beat Tolls\\", Canibus went on a sporadic tour in the U.S. to promote the record. In August 2007, Canibus made an announcement on his Myspace page that he had cut ties with his business partner Louis Lombard: \\"To my friends, family and fans, Just wanted everybody to know I no longer do business with Louis Lombard, III & Mic Club Music. =Melatonin Magik (2010)= In December 2009, it was announced that Canibus was in the process of releasing his 9th studio album Melatonin Magik. Melatonin Magik was released on February 09, 2010, to relatively positive reviews, being regarded as one of his most focused efforts yet. The album included several guest appearances (DZK~PR~ & Warbux), a marked contrast to many of his previous albums in which he kept features at a minimum. =C of Tranquility (2010)= C of Tranquility was released on Oct. 5, 2010. Producers include DJ Premier, Irv Gotti, Jake One, Scram Jones, Tha Bizness and J-Zone. Originally recorded in 2008, it was sent to Interdependent Media for track mastery and release. Many of the beats were changed, and a few of the tracks were shortened. =Lyrical Law (2011)= Originally intended to be a Melatonin Magik remix album, as more and more guests were invited to feature, Canibus decided to also record new material for the album, and it quickly evolved into an official solo album. In April 2011, it was announced that he would be selling the album through his new website, canibuscatalogue.com in order to have more control over promotion and sale. An allegedly fraudulent Twitter account posing to be Canibus began posting inflammatory comments towards Royce da 5'9\\" and the Shady Records camp in early 2011, inciting verbal rebuttals from Royce, believing that the account had been him. Royce's fulmination continued, even after it had been announced that the account was faked by Canibus himself. This caused Canibus to release snippets from a track in which he has lines directed toward Royce. Royce responded simply by saying that Canibus had \\"fallen off\\" and could no longer rap well. Similar comments regarding the track were made by affiliate Joe Budden. Insulted, Canibus decided to release two audio snippets. One titled \\"Lyrical Law VS Joey Cupcakes\\" in which he harshly insults Budden; poking fun at his personal life and taking smaller shots at Royce da 5'9\\". the other, titled \\"Lyrical Law VS Royce da 5'9\\"\\" was a length of audio in which he goes in depth about his perception of the situation and further insults Royce da 5'9\\". A track entitled \\"Spring Training\\" was released by Joe Budden two days after \\"Lyrical Law VS Joey Cupcakes\\" containing lines directed towards Canibus. To many, the track appears to be a response. This is untrue however, as the track was recorded prior to having a conflict with Canibus. As of June 2011, an official response from either Royce or Budden (aside from brief messages on Twitter) has yet to surface. =Canibus vs Dizaster (2012)= Canibus completed his first rap battle for King of the Dot on June 9, 2012. Canibus participated in the first two rounds and controversially resorted to pulling out a notepad to read his bars during the third round, after admitting defeat and wishing to recite what he said were \\"30 pages of rhymes\\" that he had failed to memorize.CANNIBUS‚Äô Line Of Twitter Disses The battle was part of King of the Dot's Fresh Coast division in L.A. An open letter, originally thought to have been written by Canibus on Tumblr, explaining his performance about the battle surfaced online, though it was later debunked by his manager as fake, saying that Canibus will make an official statement when the time is right. Canibus later released an official statement on his Facebook page. About the battle itself, Canibus commented that \\"Sometimes people need laughter and entertainment at the expense of others embarrassment but hip hop means so much to me I don't care.\\" Military career In 2002, Canibus signed up for the United States Army. In a 2005 interview, Canibus stated \\"I enlisted because I wanted to get away from the music... I wanted to do something that gave me a separate definition from what I had done all through my teens and twenties. I was 28 when I enlisted.\\" In 2004, he was caught smoking cannabis and was subsequently discharged. Discography Canibus * Can-I-Bus (1998) * 2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus) (2000) * C!

Signed to RCA Nashville in 1989, Black's debut album Killin' Time' produced four straight number one singles on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. Although his momentum gradually slowed throughout the 1990s, Black consistently charted hit songs into the 2000s. He has had more than 30 singles on the US Billboard country charts, twenty-two of which have reached number one, in addition to having released twelve studio albums and several compilation albums. In 2003, Black founded his own record label, Equity Music Group. Black has also ventured into acting, having made appearances in a 1993 episode of the TV series Wings and in the 1994 film Maverick, as well as a starring role in 1998's Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack.  Early life  Clinton Patrick Black was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, the youngest of four children born to G.A.The initials G.A. do not stand for anything. (Mitchell, July 2, 1989) and Ann Black, and lived in nearby Red Bank.Sweetland, Phil. \\"From Newark (and Environs) to Nashville\\", The New York Times, July 21, 2002. Accessed July 3, 2012. \\"'I was born in Long Branch, but my parents were living in Red Bank, so that's what I think of as my birthplace,' Mr. Black said.\\" The family moved back to Texas, where G.A. Black had been raised, before Clint was one year old. He was raised in Katy, Texas. Music was always present in the house. Black taught himself to play harmonica before he was 13, and at 14 wrote his first song. His father remarked that it was at that age that the parents \\"first noticed that he had a great voice\\". By 15, Black had learned to play guitar. As a teenager Black joined his elder brothers, Mark, Kevin and Brian, in their small band. On Saturday afternoons, the family would host backyard barbecues and invite the neighborhood to listen to the boys sing. Some weekends would attract up to 70 people. Black eventually dropped out of high school to play with his brothers, before becoming a solo act. Music career=1983‚Äì88: Early career= Black was initially drawn to a variety of musical genres. According to his father, he chose to focus on country music in the early 1980s, after singers George Strait and Reba McEntire moved the genre back toward the more traditional; in the style kept alive by George Jones and Merle Haggard. For six years, Black supported himself as a construction worker, bait cutter, and fishing guide, while singing at various lounges as a solo singer and guitarist. In 1987, at one of the gigs he met another guitarist, Hayden Nicholas. The two men connected musically and began a song writing partnership that would last decades. In the late 1980s, Black delivered a demo of their collaboration \\"Nobody's Home\\" to record promoter Sammy Alfano. Within two days of that delivery, Black was invited to a meeting with Bill Ham, who managed ZZ Top. =1989‚Äì91: Breakthrough= Black soon signed with RCA at that time considered one of the \\"most aggressive\\" labels in country music. His first album, Killin' Time, was released in 1989. Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black; four of them were attributed solely to him, while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas. In a departure from most other country albums, Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record Killin' Time. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990. He made his debut in 1989 with the single, \\"A Better Man\\", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in early June. This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked at the top of the chart. In total, five singles off of his debut album reached number one, the first time any country artist had accomplished this feat. Black won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989. At the end of the year, his singles, \\"A Better Man\\" and \\"Killin' Time\\" place number one and number two on the year-end country singles charts. It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year. Looking back at the early stages of his career, Black recalled: \\"'At one point, I knew I crossed this line out of obscurity and I felt like no matter what happened from that point on I would always be remembered for \\"Killin' Time.\\" There was this kind of mixed feeling of remorse and excitement.'\\" In late 1990, the Los Angeles Times surveyed country music industry insiders to determine which acts could be expected to sell the most records over the next seven years.Seven years was the typical length of a recording contract. Black placed second in the poll, two votes behind Garth Brooks. The survey results were surprising in that 10 of the top 20 artists named were relative newcomers to the industry; in the past, country music had been dominated by artists with several decades experience. The plethora of new acts confused some reviewers, however. Many reviewers lumped many of the new acts together; as Newsweek's David Gates wrote: \\"Good song, good voice, hot band: who cares which one it is this time?\\" Black soon became known as one of Nashville's \\"hat acts\\"; like other country artists such as Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, and Mark Chesnutt, Black was a relative newcomer who wore a hat, and had \\"clean, neotraditional sound with pop appeal\\". Killin' Time was certified platinum in 1990. Black's second album, Put Yourself in My Shoes, was released in November 1990. It reached number two on the country chart and was in the top 20 on the pop album charts. This success on the pop charts resulted from a change in the way Billboard calculated album sales; a new reliance on Nielsen SoundScan instead of information from selected record stores showed that sales of country albums had previously been under counted. The album did not meet with as much critical acclaim as his debut, but nonetheless still included several hit singles. He began touring with Alabama. Black began dating actress Lisa Hartman in 1990. The couple kept their relationship very quiet. The first picture of the two of them together was not published until the week they were engaged. The couple married in Katy, Texas, in October 1991. Black has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1991. =1992: Lawsuits and The Hard Way= In March 1992, Black sued his manager, Bill Ham, for breach of contract; Black sought $2 million in damages and requested that Ham return $4 million in royalties. Under the terms of their initial contract, Ham controlled all publishing royalties for any song that Black wrote or co-wrote for his first eight albums. Because Black wrote all of his own music, this amounted to a fee of 20 to 30 cents per album sold. Industry standards generally counseled songwriters to form their own publication companies, so they would be able to retain more of the royalties. Ham promptly countersued, blaming the initial lawsuit on poor advice Black received from his new personal assistant, his mother-in-law Jonni Hartman. His lawyer told the press that \\"Mr. Ham invested $1 million of his own money in Clint Black's career at a time when nobody else would do so. For that commitment, Mr. Black should show a little gratitude and honor his contracts\\". By mid-1992, Black's first two albums had sold a combined 5 million copies. The difficulties with Ham caused a delay in the release of Black's third album, The Hard Way, which was released on July 14. The album had been expected the year previously, and during the delay the country music scene changed. Both Alan Jackson and Travis Tritt achieved greater success, and Billy Ray Cyrus became a teen idol. The competition that Black faced was now much stiffer than with his earlier albums. According to Black, he and producer James Stroud spent more time putting this album together than either of those preceding and were \\"a lot more aggressive in the way we cut and mixed the album\\". Black was also more satisfied with the vocals on this album. Several of the songs on The Hard Way, including \\"Burn One Down\\", were initially reported to be Black's responses to his situation with Ham. Co writer Nicholas refuted the rumors, maintaining that most of those songs were written in the late 1980s. To promote the album, Black launched The Hard Way Tour on June 26, 1992. The tour ran for 11 months. Reviewers noticed that with this album Black presented a \\"new, sexier image\\", wearing tighter clothing and in many cases leaving behind his trademark hat. Black commented simply that he was bored wearing the hat all the time. =1993‚Äì99: Continued success= Black's fourth album, No Time to Kill was released almost a year after The Hard Way. The album received mixed reviews. The Houston Chronicle noted that Black's duet with Wynonna Judd, \\"A Bad Goodbye\\", was \\"precisely the kind of radio-ready, big-production ballad that record companies tend to force on their artists when they sense that their careers are in trouble....[I]t sticks out like a sore thumb in his body of work.\\" On the other hand, a review in Time magazine thought the duet helped Black show his emotions more intensely. Some reviewers also noted that in some of the more serious songs on the album, Black's voice sounded strained. Clint Black's Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame One Emotion followed in late 1994. Also a platinum certified album in the US, this album accounted for five straight top five hits. First was the number four \\"Untanglin' My Mind\\", a Merle Haggard co-write. After it came the number three \\"Wherever You Go\\", three-week number one \\"Summer's Comin'\\", the number two title track and finally the number four \\"Life Gets Away.\\" The latter two were also number one country hits in Canada. In 1996, Black became the fourth country music singer to earn a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.The first three were Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, and Garth Brooks. Later that year, he released his first greatest-hits package. This was led off by the chart-topper \\"Like the Rain\\", which spent three weeks at number one. After it came the number six \\"Half Way Up\\", his first single since \\"One More Payment\\" to miss the top five. Black's next album, 1997's Nothin' but the Taillights, was released to mediocre reviews. Thom Owens of AllMusic said that the album made no attempt to change his sound, and was \\"sturdy\\" but less country than his previous efforts. Lead-off single \\"Still Holding On\\", a duet with labelmate Martina McBride, became his first single to land outside the top 10, with a number 11 peak that year. He soon recovered his chart momentum with the number two \\"Something That We Do\\" followed by two straight chart- toppers in the album's Steve Wariner-penned title track and \\"The Shoes You're Wearing\\". The next two singles ‚Äì the number 12 \\"Loosen Up My Strings\\" and number 29 \\"You Don't Need Me Now\\" ‚Äì were less successful. In 1998, he ventured slightly into Big Band Jazz when he recorded a cover of the Christmas song \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" for the soundtrack of the animated movie of the same name. In 1999, Black released D'lectrified, which relied completely on acoustic instruments. Nevertheless, USAToday thought the \\"album sounds as full and brash as an electric album since he used creative arrangements and horn sections\\". Three of the songs on the albums were remakes of previous Black singles. Several others featured guest appearances by some of Black's idols, including Waylon Jennings, Kenny Loggins, and Eric Idle. The songs tended to be longer than most of those played on country radio, with many stretching more than five minutes. =1999‚Äì2013: Later career= Black performing at a benefit concert Black and Hartman welcomed their first child, Lily Pearl Black, in May 2001. Black took a three-year break from the music industry to stay home with his daughter. He explained that \\"it ended up not being a smart career move, but it was a real smart dad move. ‚Ä¶ I wouldn't go back and try to do anything for my career in exchange for that.\\" During his sabbatical, Black spent time reassessing his career. After deciding he was unwilling to work within the current recording industry system, he formed his own record label, Equity Music Group. Black admitted that it was difficult to leave RCA. In his 14 years with the label, he had sold over 20 million records. The new label operated under very different rules than those Black had begun his own career under. Artists were guaranteed ownership of their songs and were granted an equity stake in the label. The first release from the new label was Black's next album, Spend My Time; his eighth studio album was Black's first release in five years . The Houston Chronicle called it \\"arguably the most adventurous of his career\\". In 2005 Black released Drinkin' Songs and Other Logic. Black chose the title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: \\"I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989‚ÄîWaylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since.\\" Black has continued to record new material, however. In 2007, he released the single \\"The Strong One\\" the first original song he has recorded that he did not write. The song was included on his first digital EP, released on March 11, 2008. Titled \\"The Long Cool EP,\\" the collection features Black's single, \\"Long Cool Woman\\", \\"The Strong One\\" and a duet with his wife titled \\"You Still Get to Me\\". Equity Music Group closed its doors in December 2008 due to economic difficulties. Black was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists. =2013‚Äìpresent: Return to music= Since the closure of his label in 2008, Black had intermittently hinted at a new album that never materialized. In 2013, he issued a Cracker Barrel-exclusive album which featured re-recorded versions of some of his biggest hits as well as three new songs. Black stated that he hired the same musicians that had played on the original versions to perform the new ones, and that some songs were approached from a \\"fresh angle\\" while others were made to be as close to the originals as possible. In early 2015, Black appeared with Joe Nichols on the ACM Superstar Duets special, which featured modern artists teaming up with older icons that had influenced their music. In July 2015, it was reported that Black had signed a new record deal with independent label Thirty Tigers to release an album of new studio material in the Fall. The record title was revealed shortly thereafter as On Purpose, with a release date of September 25. Black's next album, Out of Sane, was released in 2020.https://popculture.com/country- music/news/clint-black-upcoming-album-out-of-sane-try-make-music-not-trendy- exclusive/#:~:text=Clint%20Black%20is%20preparing%20to,as%20much%20as%20his%20debut. Songwriting Few country singers fill their albums primarily with their own material, and although RCA Records often pushed Black to record the material of other artists, he refused. Black recorded only his own songs until 2007, when he released the single \\"The Strong One\\". Many of his songs were the result of a collaboration with Hayden Nicholas. Their first collaboration, \\"Straight From the Factory\\", took them only 20 minutes to write, although Nicholas would later comment that \\"most of 'em weren't that easy\\". Many listeners were incredulous that such a young man (27 at the release of his first album) could have such \\"a remarkably mature perspective\\". According to Black, \\"To me, a song is more than just something to sing. It's something to learn from. It's somebody else's true feeling. I'm always trying to get at the meaning. ... When I write a line, I'm doing the same thing. I'm looking at it from the perspective of if I was driving down the road listening to it, what am I gonna get out of it?\\" Many of his songs make clever use of puns and other creative turns of phrase. While the wordplay in many of the songs on his earlier albums was widely appreciated, by the fourth album reviewers felt that the songs were not as high in quality. Rick Mitchell of the Houston Chronicle stated his opinion that The Hard Way \\"clever wordplay is no substitute for heartfelt emotion\\". Film and television Shortly after his music career took off, he began receiving offers for acting roles. He turned down every request until 1994, when he was offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received an increasing number of calls from directors who thought he would be perfect for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management. He has also had a presence on various reality television shows. In 2003, Black appeared on Nashville Star, where he acted as a mentor to the contestants. Later that year, Clint also appeared on the ABC sitcom Hope & Faith in the episode \\"Hope and Faith Get Randy\\". He later produced the debut album of series winner Buddy Jewell. In 2004, Clint appeared as himself in the TV show Las Vegas. In 2008, Black was a contestant on a short-lived CBS reality show, Secret Talents of the Stars, in which he practiced stand-up comedy. The following year, he competed on the second season of Celebrity Apprentice. He was fired after the eleventh task, placing himself in fifth place, although he returned as a member of Joan Rivers's victorious team in the season finale. In 2009, Black appeared on ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. Black has enjoyed his television experiences, describing acting as \\"another way for me to expand my creative canvas. ... I love to challenge myself.\\" He believes that most of his fans \\"just see me as a musician who is stepping into [television and film] temporarily and either doing it alright or not\\". More recently, he appeared in the movies Flicka 2 in 2010 and Flicka: Country Pride in 2012. On July 4, 2012, Black appeared on an episode of Lifetime's reality series, Coming Home, which documents servicemen and women returning to their loved ones in surprise reunions. In the episode, he is featured helping two children write a song about their Army captain father, who is returning from Afghanistan to surprise his family. On July 24, 2012, Black is surprised by History Detectives on PBS. In the episode, the show pays a visit to his Nashville residence, to uncover the story behind an artifact given to him by his wife decades ago. Musical styles and legacy Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and Willie Nelson are Black's biggest musical influences. His style is traditional country. His voice is described as a smooth baritone and was initially compared to Merle Haggard's. Black was self- taught on harmonica, guitar and bass at an early age. On his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as harmonica. In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and harmonica. Black and Lisa Hartman Black have a daughter, Lily Pearl Black, born in 2001. As of 2002, he and his wife reside in Nashville, Tennessee, after living in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California.

An Modh Conghaileach: Cuid s√≥isialachais Sh√©amais U√≠ Chonghaile. Dublin: Coisc√©im, passim 5 June 1868 ‚Äì 12 May 1916) was an Irish republican and socialist leader. Connolly was born in the Cowgate area of Edinburgh, Scotland, to Irish parents. He left school for working life at the age of 11. He also took a role in Scottish and American politics. He was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and founder of the Irish Socialist Republican Party. With James Larkin, he was centrally involved in the Dublin lock-out of 1913, as a result of which the two men formed the Irish Citizen Army (ICA) that year. He opposed British rule in Ireland, and was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916. He was executed by firing squad following the Rising. Early life Connolly was born in an Edinburgh slum in 1868, the third son of Irish parents John Connolly and Mary McGinn. His parents had moved to Scotland from County Monaghan, Ireland, and settled in the Cowgate, a ghetto where thousands of Irish people lived. He spoke with a Scottish accent throughout his life.Donal Nevin. 2005. \\"James Connolly: A Full Life\\", p. 636 Gill and Macmillan; He was born in St Patrick's Roman Catholic parish, in the Cowgate district of Edinburgh known as \\"Little Ireland\\". His father and grandfathers were labourers. He had an education up to the age of about ten in the local Catholic primary school. He left and worked in labouring jobs. Owing to the economic difficulties he was having, like his eldest brother John, he joined the British Army. He enlisted at age 14, falsifying his age and giving his name as Reid, as his brother John had done. He served in Ireland with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Scots Regiment for nearly seven years, during a turbulent period in rural areas known as the Land War. He would later become involved in the land issue. He developed a deep hatred for the British Army that lasted his entire life.Levenson 1973, p. 333 When he heard that his regiment was being transferred to India, he deserted. Connolly had another reason for not wanting to go to India; a young woman by the name of Lillie Reynolds.Levenson 1973, p. 24 Lillie moved to Scotland with James after he left the army and they married in April 1890.Morgan 1990, p. 15 They settled in Edinburgh. There, Connolly began to get involved in the Scottish Socialist Federation, but with a young family to support, he needed a way to provide for them. He briefly established a cobbler's shop in 1895, but this failed after a few months as his shoe-mending skills were insufficient.Levenson 1973, p. 39 He was strongly active with the socialist movement at the time, and prioritized this over his cobbling. Socialist involvement In the 1880s, Connolly became influenced by Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx and would later advocate a type of socialism that was based in Marxist theory. Connolly described himself as a socialist, while acknowledging the influence of Marx. He became secretary of the Scottish Socialist Federation. At the time his brother John was secretary; after John spoke at a rally in favour of the eight-hour day, however, he was fired from his job with the Edinburgh Corporation, so while he looked for work, James took over as secretary. During this time, Connolly became involved with the Independent Labour Party which Keir Hardie had formed in 1893. At some time during this period, he took up the study of, and advocated the use of, the neutral international language, Esperanto.James Connolly and Esperanto , esperanto.ie; accessed 28 May 2017. His interest in Esperanto is implicit in his 1898 article \\"The Language Movement\\", which primarily attempts to promote socialism to the nationalist revolutionaries involved in the Gaelic Revival. By 1892 he was involved in the Scottish Socialist Federation, acting as its secretary from 1895. Two months after the birth of his third daughter, word came to Connolly that the Dublin Socialist Club was looking for a full-time secretary, a job that offered a salary of a pound a week. Connolly and his family moved to Dublin, where he took up the position. At his instigation, the club quickly evolved into the Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP). The ISRP is regarded by many Irish historians as a party of pivotal importance in the early history of Irish socialism and republicanism. While active as a socialist in Great Britain, Connolly was the founding editor of The Socialist newspaper and was among the founders of the Socialist Labour Party which split from the Social Democratic Federation in 1903. Connolly joined Maud Gonne and Arthur Griffith in the Dublin protests against the Boer War.Anthony J. Jordan. Arthur Griffith with James Joyce & WB Yeats - Liberating Ireland. Westport Books, 2013 pp. 24-25 A combination of frustration with the progress of the ISRP and economic necessity caused him to emigrate to the United States in September 1903, with no plans as to what he would do there. While in America he was a member of the Socialist Labor Party of America (1906), the Socialist Party of America (1909) and the Industrial Workers of the World, and founded the Irish Socialist Federation in New York, 1907. He famously had a chapter of his 1910 book Labour in Irish History entitled \\"A chapter of horrors: Daniel O‚ÄôConnell and the working class.\\" critical of the achiever of Catholic Emancipation 60 years earlier. On Connolly's return to Ireland in 1910 he was right-hand man to James Larkin in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. He stood twice for the Wood Quay ward of Dublin Corporation but was unsuccessful. His name, and those of his family, appears in the 1911 Census of Ireland - his occupation is listed as \\"National Organiser Socialist Party\\". In 1913, in response to the Lockout, he, along with an ex-British officer, Jack White, founded the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), an armed and well-trained body of labour men whose aim was to defend workers and strikers, particularly from the frequent brutality of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Though they only numbered about 250 at most, their goal soon became the establishment of an independent and socialist Irish nation. He also founded the Irish Labour Party as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1912 and was a member of its National Executive. Around this time he met Winifred Carney in Belfast, who became his secretary and would later accompany him during the Easter Rising. Like Vladimir Lenin, Connolly opposed the First World War explicitly from a socialist perspective. Rejecting the Redmondite position, he declared \\"I know of no foreign enemy of this country except the British Government.\\" Easter Rising Connolly and the ICA made plans for an armed uprising during the war, independently of the Irish Volunteers. In early 1916, believing the Volunteers were dithering, he attempted to goad them into action by threatening to send the ICA against the British Empire alone, if necessary. This alarmed the members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, who had already infiltrated the Volunteers and had plans for an insurrection that very year. In order to talk Connolly out of any such rash action, the IRB leaders, including Tom Clarke and Patrick Pearse, met with Connolly to see if an agreement could be reached. During the meeting, the IRB and the ICA agreed to act together at Easter of that year. During the Easter Rising, beginning on 24 April 1916, Connolly was Commandant of the Dublin Brigade. As the Dublin Brigade had the most substantial role in the rising, he was de facto commander-in-chief. Connolly's leadership in the Easter rising was considered formidable. Michael Collins said of Connolly that he \\"would have followed him through hell.\\"Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland: Tim Pat Coogan / 0312295111 Following the surrender, he said to other prisoners: \\"Don't worry. Those of us that signed the proclamation will be shot. But the rest of you will be set free.\\" Death Location of Connolly's execution at Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin Connolly was not actually held in gaol, but in a room (now called the \\"Connolly Room\\") at the State Apartments in Dublin Castle, which had been converted to a first-aid station for troops recovering from the war. Connolly was sentenced to death by firing squad for his part in the rising. On 12 May 1916 he was taken by military ambulance to Royal Hospital Kilmainham, across the road from Kilmainham Gaol, and from there taken to the gaol, where he was to be executed. While Connolly was still in hospital in Dublin Castle, during a visit from his wife and daughter, he said: \\"The Socialists will not understand why I am here; they forget I am an Irishman.\\" Connolly had been so badly injured from the fighting (a doctor had already said he had no more than a day or two to live, but the execution order was still given) that he was unable to stand before the firing squad; he was carried to a prison courtyard on a stretcher. His absolution and last rites were administered by a Capuchin, Father Aloysius Travers. Asked to pray for the soldiers about to shoot him, he said: \\"I will say a prayer for all men who do their duty according to their lights.\\" Instead of being marched to the same spot where the others had been executed, at the far end of the execution yard, he was tied to a chair and then shot. His body (along with those of the other leaders) was put in a mass grave without a coffin. The executions of the rebel leaders deeply angered the majority of the Irish population, most of whom had shown no support during the rebellion. It was Connolly's execution that caused the most controversy. Historians have pointed to the manner of execution of Connolly and similar rebels, along with their actions, as being factors that caused public awareness of their desires and goals and gathered support for the movements that they had died fighting for. The executions were not well received, even throughout Britain, and drew unwanted attention from the United States, which the British Government was seeking to bring into the war in Europe. H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister, ordered that no more executions were to take place; an exception being that of Roger Casement, who was charged with high treason and had not yet been tried. Family James Connolly and his wife Lillie had seven children. Nora became an influential writer and campaigner within the Irish-republican movement as an adult. Roddy continued his father's politics. In later years, both became members of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament). Moira became a doctor and married Richard Beech.Moira Connolly, Myheritage.com One of Connolly's daughters Mona died in 1904 aged 13, when she burned herself while she did the washing for an aunt. Three months after James Connolly's execution his wife was received into the Catholic Church, at Church St. on 15 August.Gone But Not Forgotten - Fiona Connolly Legacy Statue of James Connolly in Dublin Connolly's legacy in Ireland is mainly due to his contribution to the republican cause; his legacy as a socialist has been claimed by a variety of left-wing and left-republican groups, and he is also associated with the Labour Party which he founded. Connolly was among the few European members of the Second International who opposed, outright, World War I. This put him at odds with most of the socialist leaders of Europe. He was influenced by and heavily involved with the radical Industrial Workers of the World labour union, and envisaged socialism as Industrial Union control of production. Also he envisioned the IWW forming their own political party that would bring together the feuding socialist groups such as the Socialist Labor Party of America and the Socialist Party of America. Likewise, he envisaged independent Ireland as a socialist republic. His connection and views on Revolutionary Unionism and Syndicalism have raised debate on if his image for a workers republic would be one of State or Grassroots socialism. For a time he was involved with De Leonism and the Second International until he later broke with both. In Scotland, Connolly's thinking influenced socialists such as John Maclean, who would, like him, combine his leftist thinking with nationalist ideas when he formed the Scottish Workers Republican Party. Statue of James Connolly in Belfast The Connolly Association, a British organisation campaigning for Irish unity and independence, is named after Connolly. In 1928, Follonsby miners' lodge in the Durham coalfield unfurled a newly designed banner that included a portrait of Connolly on it. The banner was burned in 1938, replaced but then painted over in 1940. A reproduction of the 1938 Connolly banner was commissioned in 2011 by the Follonsby Miners‚Äô Lodge Banner Association and it is regularly paraded at various events in County Durham ('Old King Coal' at Beamish Open Air museum, 'The Seven men of Jarrow' commemoration every June, the Durham Miners' Gala every second Saturday in July, the Tommy Hepburn annual memorial every October), in the wider UK and Ireland.Douglass, D., George Harvey: Pitman Bolshevik (Pelaw, Gateshead: Follonsby Miners‚Äô Lodge Banner Association, 2011.Douglass, D., Red Banner - Green Rosette: Tyneside and the Northern Coalfield (Gateshead: Follonsby Miners‚Äô Lodge Banner Association, 2017. There is a statue of James Connolly in Dublin, outside Liberty Hall, the offices of the SIPTU trade union. Another statue of Connolly stands in Union Park, Chicago near the offices of the UE union. There is a bust of Connolly in Troy, New York, in the park behind the statue of Uncle Sam. In March 2016 a statue of Connolly was unveiled by Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure minister Car√°l N√≠ Chuil√≠n, and Connolly's great grandson, James Connolly Heron, on Falls Road in Belfast. In a 1972 interview on The Dick Cavett Show, John Lennon stated that James Connolly was an inspiration for his song, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\". Lennon quoted Connolly's 'the female is the slave of the slave' in explaining the feminist inspiration for the song.Television interview, 11 May 1972. The Dick Cavett Show: John and Yoko collection [videorecording] DVD 2005, Connolly Station, one of the two main railway stations in Dublin, and Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, are named in his honour. In a 2002, BBC television production, 100 Greatest Britons where the British public were asked to register their vote, Connolly was voted in 64th place. In 1968, Irish group The Wolfe Tones released a single named \\"James Connolly\\", which reached number 15 in the Irish charts. The band Black 47 wrote and performed a song about Connolly that appears on their album Fire of Freedom. Irish singer-songwriter Niall Connolly has a song \\"May 12th, 1916 - A Song for James Connolly\\" on his album Dream Your Way Out of This One (2017). D√∫nedin Connolly GAC, a Scottish GAA club takes its name from his. Connolly and the events of his death are mentioned in the fourth verse of \\"The Patriot Game\\" by Irish songwriter Dominic Behan (this verse is sometimes omitted from renditions of the song).

They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement; they also had success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock and synthpop. They have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most public appearances since 1999 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. After Bangalter and Homem-Christo's indie rock band Darlin' disbanded, they began experimenting with drum machines and synthesisers. Their debut studio album Homework was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles \\"Around the World\\" and \\"Da Funk\\". Their second album, Discovery, had further success, supported by hit singles \\"One More Time\\", \\"Digital Love\\" and \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\". In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, to mixed reviews, though the singles \\"Robot Rock\\" and \\"Technologic\\" achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. They composed the score for the film Tron: Legacy, which was released in 2010 alongside its soundtrack album. In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records, and released their fourth album, Random Access Memories, to acclaim; lead single \\"Get Lucky\\" reached the top 10 in the charts of 32 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for \\"Get Lucky\\". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their first number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with the song \\"Starboy\\", a collaboration with The Weeknd. , Daft Punk had sold over 12 million albums worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked them No. 12 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

The single also contained the final mix of \\"The New Wave\\" called \\"Alive\\", which was to be featured on Daft Punk's first album. Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record \\"Da Funk\\". It became the duo's first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of \\"Da Funk\\", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. The duo eventually settled on Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which the duo licensed its tracks to the major label through its production company, Daft Trax. Bangalter stated that while the duo received numerous offers from record labels, they wanted to wait and ensure that Daft Punk did not lose creative control. He ultimately considered the deal with Virgin to be more akin to a partnership. In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States.

It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into warfare. In April 1916, Irish republicans launched the Easter Rising against British rule and proclaimed an Irish Republic. Although it was crushed after a week of fighting, the Easter Rising and the British response led to greater popular support for Irish independence. In the December 1918 election, the republican party Sinn F√©in won a landslide victory in Ireland. On 21 January 1919 they formed a breakaway government (D√°il √âireann) and declared Irish independence. That day, two RIC officers were shot dead in the Soloheadbeg ambush by IRA volunteers acting on their own initiative. The conflict developed gradually. For much of 1919, IRA activity involved capturing weaponry and freeing republican prisoners, while the D√°il set about building a state. In September, the British government outlawed the D√°il and Sinn F√©in and the conflict intensified. The IRA began ambushing RIC and British Army patrols, attacking their barracks and forcing isolated barracks to be abandoned. The British government bolstered the RIC with recruits from Britain‚Äîthe Black and Tans and Auxiliaries‚Äîwho became notorious for ill-discipline and reprisal attacks on civilians, p. 105. some of which were authorised by the British government.Coleman, Marie. The Irish Revolution, 1916-1923. Routledge, 2013. pp.86-87 Thus the conflict is sometimes called the Black and Tan War. The conflict also involved civil disobedience, notably the refusal of Irish railwaymen to transport British forces or military supplies. In mid-1920, republicans won control of most county councils, and British authority collapsed in most of the south and west, forcing the British government to introduce emergency powers. About 300 people had been killed by late 1920, but the conflict escalated in November. On Bloody Sunday in Dublin, 21 November 1920, fourteen British intelligence operatives were assassinated in the morning; then in the afternoon the RIC opened fire on a crowd at a Gaelic football match, killing fourteen civilians and wounding sixty-five. A week later, seventeen Auxiliaries were killed by the IRA in the Kilmichael Ambush in County Cork. The British government declared martial law in much of southern Ireland. The centre of Cork city was burnt out by British forces in December 1920. Violence continued to escalate over the next seven months, when 1,000 people were killed and 4,500 republicans were interned. Much of the fighting took place in Munster (particularly County Cork), Dublin and Belfast, which together saw over 75 percent of the conflict deaths. The conflict in north-east Ulster had a sectarian aspect. While the Catholic minority there mostly backed Irish independence, the Protestant majority were mostly unionist/loyalist. A Special Constabulary was formed, made up mostly of Protestants, and loyalist paramilitaries were active. They attacked Catholics in reprisal for IRA actions, and in Belfast a sectarian conflict raged in which almost 500 were killed, most of them Catholics.Eunan O'Halpin, \\"Counting Terror\\", in David Fitzpatrick ed. Terror in Ireland (2012), p.152 In May 1921, Ireland was partitioned under British law by the Government of Ireland Act, which created Northern Ireland. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire (or 'truce') on 11 July 1921. The post-ceasefire talks led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921. This ended British rule in most of Ireland and, after a ten- month transitional period overseen by a provisional government, the Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion on 6 December 1922. Northern Ireland remained within the United Kingdom. After the ceasefire, violence in Belfast and fighting in border areas of Northern Ireland continued, and the IRA launched a failed Northern offensive in May 1922. In June 1922, disagreement among republicans over the Anglo-Irish Treaty led to the eleven- month Irish Civil War. The Irish Free State awarded 62,868 medals for service during the War of Independence, of which 15,224 were issued to IRA fighters of the flying columns.Neil Richardson, \\"A Coward if I return, a Hero if I fall: Stories of Irishmen in World War I\\", (Dublin 2010), p.13. Origins of the conflict=Home Rule Crisis= Since the 1870s, Irish nationalists in the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) had been demanding Home Rule, or self- government, from Britain. Fringe organisations, such as Arthur Griffith's Sinn F√©in, instead argued for some form of Irish independence, but they were in a small minority. The demand for Home Rule was eventually granted by the British Government in 1912, immediately prompting a prolonged crisis within the United Kingdom as Ulster unionists formed an armed organisation the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) to resist this measure of devolution, at least in territory they could control. In turn, nationalists formed their own paramilitary organisation, the Irish Volunteers. The British Parliament passed the Government of Ireland Act 1914, known as the Home Rule Act, on 18 September 1914 with an amending Bill for the partition of Ireland introduced by Ulster Unionist MPs, but the Act's implementation was immediately postponed by the Suspensory Act 1914 due to the outbreak of the First World War in the previous month. The majority of nationalists followed their IPP leaders and John Redmond's call to support Britain and the Allied war effort in Irish regiments of the New British Army, the intention being to ensure the commencement of Home Rule after the war. However, a significant minority of the Irish Volunteers opposed Ireland's involvement in the war. The Volunteer movement split, a majority leaving to form the National Volunteers under Redmond. The remaining Irish Volunteers, under Eoin MacNeill, held that they would maintain their organisation until Home Rule had been granted. Within this Volunteer movement, another faction, led by the separatist Irish Republican Brotherhood, began to prepare for a revolt against British rule in Ireland.O‚ÄôRiordan, Tom√°s: UCC Multitext Project in Irish History John Redmond =Easter Rising= The plan for revolt was realised in the Easter Rising of 1916, in which the Volunteers launched an insurrection whose aim was to end British rule. The insurgents issued the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, proclaiming Ireland's independence as a republic. The Rising, in which over four hundred people died,1916 Necrology. Glasnevin Trust. was almost exclusively confined to Dublin and was put down within a week, but the British response, executing the leaders of the insurrection and arresting thousands of nationalist activists, galvanised support for the separatist Sinn F√©in the party which the republicans first adopted and then took over as well as followers from Countess Markievicz, the female lead of the Easter Rising. By now, support for the British war effort was waning, and Irish public opinion was shocked and outraged by some of the actions committed by British troops, particularly the murder of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and the imposition of wartime martial law. =First D√°il= Result of the 1918 UK general election in Ireland In April 1918, the British Cabinet, in the face of the crisis caused by the German Spring Offensive, attempted with a dual policy to simultaneously link the enactment of conscription into Ireland with the implementation of Home Rule, as outlined in the report of the Irish Convention of 8 April 1918. This further alienated Irish nationalists and produced mass demonstrations during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In the 1918 general election Irish voters showed their disapproval of British policy by giving Sinn F√©in 70% (73 seats out of 105,) of Irish seats, 25 of these uncontested. Sinn F√©in won 91% of the seats outside of Ulster on 46.9% of votes cast but was in a minority in Ulster, where unionists were in a majority. Sinn F√©in pledged not to sit in the UK Parliament at Westminster, but rather to set up an Irish Parliament. This parliament, known as the First D√°il, and its ministry, called the Aireacht, consisting only of Sinn F√©in members, met at the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. The D√°il reaffirmed the 1916 Proclamation with the Irish Declaration of Independence, and issued a Message to the Free Nations of the World, which stated that there was an \\"existing state of war, between Ireland and England\\". The Irish Volunteers were reconstituted as the \\"Irish Republican Army\\" or IRA. The IRA was perceived by some members of D√°il √âireann to have a mandate to wage war on the British Dublin Castle administration. Forces=British= RIC and British Army personnel near Limerick, c.1920 The heart of British power in Ireland was the Dublin Castle administration, often known to the Irish as \\"the Castle\\".Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 18. The head of the Castle administration was the Lord Lieutenant, to whom a Chief Secretary was responsible, leading‚Äîin the words of the British historian Peter Cottrell‚Äîto an \\"administration renowned for its incompetence and inefficiency\\". Ireland was divided into three military districts. During the course of the war, two British divisions, the 5th and the 6th, were based in Ireland with their respective headquarters in the Curragh and Cork. By July 1921 there were 50,000 British troops based in Ireland; by contrast there were 14,000 soldiers in metropolitan Britain.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 19. While the British Army had historically been heavily dependent on Irish recruitment, concern over divided loyalties led to the redeployment from 1919 of all regular Irish regiments to garrisons outside Ireland itself. The two main police forces in Ireland were the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 20. Of the 17,000 policemen in Ireland, 513 were killed by the IRA between 1919‚Äì21 while 682 were wounded. Of the RIC's senior officers, 60% were Irish Protestants and the rest Catholic, while 70% of the rank and file of the RIC were Irish Catholic with the rest Protestant. The RIC was trained for police work, not war, and was woefully ill-prepared to take on counter-insurgency duties.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 pages 49‚Äì52. Until March 1920, London regarded the unrest in Ireland as primarily an issue for the police and did not regard it as a war.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 54. The purpose of the Army was to back up the police. During the course of the war, about a quarter of Ireland was put under martial law, mostly in Munster; in the rest of the country British authority was not deemed sufficiently threatened to warrant it. During the course of the war, the British created two paramilitary police forces to supplement the work of the RIC, recruited mostly from World War I veterans, namely the Temporary Constables (better known as the \\"Black and Tans\\") and the Temporary Cadets or Auxiliary Division (known as the \\"Auxies\\").Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 21. =Irish republican= On 25 November 1913, the Irish Volunteers were formed by Eoin MacNeill in response to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force that had been founded earlier in the year to fight against Home Rule.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 24. Also in 1913, the Irish Citizen Army was founded by the trade unionists and socialists James Larkin and James Connolly following a series of violent incidents between trade unionists and the Dublin police in the Dublin lock- out.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 26. In June 1914, Nationalist leader John Redmond forced the Volunteers to give his nominees a majority on the ruling committee. When, in September 1914, Redmond encouraged the Volunteers to enlist in the British Army, a faction led by Eoin MacNeill broke with the Redmondites, who became known as the National Volunteers, rather than fight for Britain in the war. Many of the National Volunteers did enlist, and the majority of the men in the 16th (Irish) Division of the British Army had formerly served in the National Volunteers.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 25. The Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army launched the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, when an Irish Republic was proclaimed. Thereafter they became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Between 1919 and 1921 the IRA claimed to have a total strength of 70,000, but only about 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 28. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War, but there were a number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The basic structure of the IRA was the \\"flying column\\" which could number between 20 and 100 men. Finally, Michael Collins created the \\"Squad\\"‚Äîgunmen responsible to himself who were assigned special duties such as the assassination of policemen and suspected informers within the IRA. Course of the war=Pre-war violence= The years between the Easter Rising of 1916 and the beginning of the War of Independence in 1919 were not bloodless. Thomas Ashe, one of the Volunteer leaders imprisoned for his role in the 1916 rebellion, died on hunger strike, after attempted force-feeding in 1917. In 1918, during disturbances arising out of the anti-conscription campaign, six civilians died in confrontations with the police and British Army and over 1,000 were arrested. Armistice Day was marked by severe rioting in Dublin, which left over 100 British soldiers injured.Padraig Yeates, Jimmy Wren, Michael Collins, an Illustrated Life, (1989) , p. 27. There were also raids for arms by the Volunteers,Charles Townshend, Easter 1916, The Irish Rebellion p. 338. at least one shooting of a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) policeman and the burning of an RIC barracks in Kerry.T Ryle Dwyer, Tans Terror and Troubles, Kerry's Real Fighting Story 1916‚Äì23. In County Cork, four rifles were seized from the Eyeries barracks in March 1918 and men from the barracks were beaten that August. In early July 1918, Volunteers ambushed two RIC men who had been stationed to stop a feis being held on the road between Ballingeary and Ballyvourney in the first armed attack on the RIC since the Easter Rising ‚Äì one was shot in the neck, the other beaten, and police carbines and ammunition were seized.M√≠che√°l √ì S√∫illeabh√°in. \\"The Mouth of the Glen\\" in Where Mountainy Men Have Sown. p39-45, 1965 Patrols in Bantry and Ballyvourney were badly beaten in September and October. The attacks brought a British military presence from the summer of 1918, which only briefly quelled the violence, and an increase in police raids.Peter Hart. The I.R.A. and its enemies: violence and community in Cork, 1916‚Äì1923. pp. 62‚Äì63 However, there was as yet no co- ordinated armed campaign against British forces or RIC. =Initial hostilities= Police wanted poster for Dan Breen, one of those involved in the Soloheadbeg Ambush in 1919. While it was not clear in the beginning of 1919 that the D√°il ever intended to gain independence by military means, and war was not explicitly threatened in Sinn F√©in's 1918 manifesto,Ireland, 1798‚Äì1998: Politics and War (A History of the Modern British Isles) by Alvin Jackson (), p. 244.The Irish War by Tony Geraghty (), p. 330. an incident occurred on 21 January 1919, the same day as the First D√°il convened. The Soloheadbeg Ambush, in County Tipperary, was led by Se√°n Treacy, S√©umas Robinson, Se√°n Hogan and Dan Breen acting on their own initiative. The IRA attacked and shot two RIC officers, Constables James McDonnell and Patrick O'Connell, who were escorting explosives. Breen later recalled: > ...we took the action deliberately, having thought over the matter and > talked it over between us. Treacy had stated to me that the only way of > starting a war was to kill someone, and we wanted to start a war, so we > intended to kill some of the police whom we looked upon as the foremost and > most important branch of the enemy forces. The only regret that we had > following the ambush was that there were only two policemen in it, instead > of the six we had expected.History Ireland, May 2007, p. 56.

The British government declared South Tipperary a Special Military Area under the Defence of the Realm Act two days later. Sean Treacy and the 3rd.

The war was not formally declared by the D√°il, and it ran its course parallel to the D√°il's political life. On 10 April 1919 the D√°il was told: > As regards the Republican prisoners, we must always remember that this > country is at war with England and so we must in a sense regard them as > necessary casualties in the great fight.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 1 ‚Äì 10 April > 1919 . In January 1921, two years after the war had started, the D√°il debated \\"whether it was feasible to accept formally a state of war that was being thrust on them, or not\\", and decided not to declare war.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 1 ‚Äì 25 January 1921 . Then on 11 March, D√°il √âireann President √âamon de Valera called for acceptance of a \\"state of war with England\\". The Dail voted unanimously to empower him to declare war whenever he saw fit, but he did not formally do so.D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 1 ‚Äì 11 March 1921 .The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan (), p. 25. =Violence spreads= Wall plaque in Great Denmark Street, Dublin where the Dublin IRA Active Service Unit was founded. Volunteers began to attack British government property, carry out raids for arms and funds and target and kill prominent members of the British administration. The first was Resident Magistrate John C. Milling, who was shot dead in Westport, County Mayo, for having sent Volunteers to prison for unlawful assembly and drilling.Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 26. They mimicked the successful tactics of the Boers' fast violent raids without uniform. Although some republican leaders, notably √âamon de Valera, favoured classic conventional warfare to legitimise the new republic in the eyes of the world, the more practically experienced Michael Collins and the broader IRA leadership opposed these tactics as they had led to the military d√©bacle of 1916. Others, notably Arthur Griffith, preferred a campaign of civil disobedience rather than armed struggle.M.E. Collins, Ireland 1868‚Äì1966, p. 254. The violence used was at first deeply unpopular with Irish people and it took the heavy-handed British response to popularise it among much of the population. During the early part of the conflict, roughly from 1919 to the middle of 1920, there was a relatively limited amount of violence. Much of the nationalist campaign involved popular mobilisation and the creation of a republican \\"state within a state\\" in opposition to British rule. British journalist Robert Lynd wrote in The Daily News in July 1920 that: > So far as the mass of people are concerned, the policy of the day is not > active but a passive policy. Their policy is not so much to attack the > Government as to ignore it and to build up a new government by its > side.Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 42. =Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) as special target= A group of RIC officers in 1917 The IRA's main target throughout the conflict was the mainly Irish Catholic Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), the British government's police in Ireland, outside Dublin. Its members and barracks (especially the more isolated ones) were vulnerable, and they were a source of much-needed arms. The RIC numbered 9,700 men stationed in 1,500 barracks throughout Ireland.The RIC's strength in late 1919 was down to 9,300 but extensive recruitment saw it reach a height of over 14,000 by June 1921, Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 49. A policy of ostracism of RIC men was announced by the D√°il on 11 April 1919.Hopkinson, War of Independence, p. 26. This proved successful in demoralising the force as the war went on, as people turned their faces from a force increasingly compromised by association with British government repression.Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913‚Äì1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 46. The rate of resignation went up and recruitment in Ireland dropped off dramatically. Often, the RIC were reduced to buying food at gunpoint, as shops and other businesses refused to deal with them. Some RIC men co-operated with the IRA through fear or sympathy, supplying the organisation with valuable information. By contrast with the effectiveness of the widespread public boycott of the police, the military actions carried out by the IRA against the RIC at this time were relatively limited. In 1919, 11 RIC men and 4 Dublin Metropolitan Police G Division detectives were killed and another 20 RIC wounded.Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence pp. 201‚Äì2. Other aspects of mass participation in the conflict included strikes by organised workers, in opposition to the British presence in Ireland. In Limerick in April 1919, a general strike was called by the Limerick Trades and Labour Council, as a protest against the declaration of a \\"Special Military Area\\" under the Defence of the Realm Act, which covered most of Limerick city and a part of the county. Special permits, to be issued by the RIC, would now be required to enter the city. The Trades Council's special Strike Committee controlled the city for fourteen days in an episode that is known as the Limerick Soviet. Similarly, in May 1920, Dublin dockers refused to handle any war mat√©riel and were soon joined by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, who banned railway drivers from carrying members of the British forces. Blackleg train drivers were brought over from England, after drivers refused to carry British troops. The strike badly hampered British troop movements until December 1920, when it was called off.Charles Townshend, 'The Irish Railway Strike of 1920: Industrial Action and Civil Resistance in the Struggle for Independence,' Irish Historical Studies 21, no. 83 (May 1979): 265‚Äì82. The British government managed to bring the situation to an end, when they threatened to withhold grants from the railway companies, which would have meant that workers would no longer have been paid.Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence p. 43. Attacks by the IRA also steadily increased, and by early 1920, they were attacking isolated RIC stations in rural areas, causing them to be abandoned as the police retreated to the larger towns. =Collapse of the British administration= In early April 1920, 400 abandoned RIC barracks were burned to the ground to prevent them being used again, along with almost one hundred income tax offices. The RIC withdrew from much of the countryside, leaving it in the hands of the IRA.M.E. Collins, Ireland 1868‚Äì1966, p. 258. In June‚ÄìJuly 1920, assizes failed all across the south and west of Ireland; trials by jury could not be held because jurors would not attend. The collapse of the court system demoralised the RIC and many police resigned or retired. The Irish Republican Police (IRP) was founded between April and June 1920, under the authority of D√°il √âireann and the former IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Brugha to replace the RIC and to enforce the ruling of the D√°il Courts, set up under the Irish Republic. By 1920, the IRP had a presence in 21 of Ireland's 32 counties.M.E. Collins, Ireland, p. 252. The D√°il Courts were generally socially conservative, despite their revolutionary origins, and halted the attempts of some landless farmers at redistribution of land from wealthier landowners to poorer farmers.Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 44. The Inland Revenue ceased to operate in most of Ireland. People were instead encouraged to subscribe to Collins' \\"National Loan\\", set up to raise funds for the young government and its army. By the end of the year the loan had reached ¬£358,000. It eventually reached ¬£380,000. An even larger amount, totalling over $5 million, was raised in the United States by Irish Americans and sent to Ireland to finance the Republic. Rates were still paid to local councils but nine out of eleven of these were controlled by Sinn F√©in, who naturally refused to pass them on to the British government. By mid-1920, the Irish Republic was a reality in the lives of many people, enforcing its own law, maintaining its own armed forces and collecting its own taxes. The British Liberal journal, The Nation, wrote in August 1920 that \\"the central fact of the present situation in Ireland is that the Irish Republic exists\\". The British forces, in trying to re-assert their control over the country, often resorted to arbitrary reprisals against republican activists and the civilian population. An unofficial government policy of reprisals began in September 1919 in Fermoy, County Cork, when 200 British soldiers looted and burned the main businesses of the town, after one of their number ‚Äì a soldier of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry who was the first British Army death in the campaign ‚Äì had been killed in an armed raid by the local IRASeptember 1919 . on a church parade the day before (7 September). The ambushers were a unit of the No 2 Cork Brigade, under command of Liam Lynch, who wounded four of the other soldiers and disarmed the rest before fleeing in their cars. The local coroner's inquest refused to return a murder verdict over the soldier and local businessmen who had sat on the jury were targeted in the reprisal. Arthur Griffith estimated that in the first 18 months of the conflict, British forces carried out 38,720 raids on private homes, arrested 4,982 suspects, committed 1,604 armed assaults, carried out 102 indiscriminate shootings and burnings in towns and villages, and killed 77 people including women and children.Irish Self-Determination League of Great Britain, 1919‚Äì24 . In March 1920, Tom√°s Mac Curtain, the Sinn F√©in Lord Mayor of Cork, was shot dead in front of his wife at his home, by men with blackened faces who were seen returning to the local police barracks. The jury at the inquest into his death returned a verdict of wilful murder against David Lloyd George (the British Prime Minister) and District Inspector Swanzy, among others. Swanzy was later tracked down and killed in Lisburn, County Antrim. This pattern of killings and reprisals escalated in the second half of 1920 and in 1921.Collins, Ireland, p. 262. =IRA organisation and operations= Michael Collins Michael Collins was a driving force behind the independence movement. Nominally the Minister of Finance in the republic's government and IRA Director of Intelligence, he was involved in providing funds and arms to the IRA units and in the selection of officers. Collins' charisma and organisational capability galvanised many who came in contact with him. He established what proved an effective network of spies among sympathetic members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police's (DMP) G Division and other important branches of the British administration. The G Division men were a relatively small political division active in subverting the republican movement and were detested by the IRA as often they were used to identify volunteers, who would have been unknown to British soldiers or the later Black and Tans. Collins set up the \\"Squad\\", a group of men whose sole duty was to seek out and kill \\"G-men\\" and other British spies and agents. Collins' Squad began killing RIC intelligence officers in July 1919.Michael Collins's Intelligence War by Michael T. Foy (), p. 25. Many G-men were offered a chance to resign or leave Ireland by the IRA. One spy who escaped with his life was F. Digby Hardy, who was exposed by Arthur Griffith before an \\"IRA\\" meeting, which in fact consisted of Irish and foreign journalists, and then advised to take the next boat out of Dublin.T. Ryle Dwyer. The Squad: And the Intelligence Operations of Michael Collins. pp. 137‚Äì39. The Chief of Staff of the IRA was Richard Mulcahy, who was responsible for organising and directing IRA units around the country. In theory, both Collins and Mulcahy were responsible to Cathal Brugha, the D√°il's Minister of Defence, but, in practice, Brugha had only a supervisory role, recommending or objecting to specific actions. A great deal also depended on IRA leaders in local areas (such as Liam Lynch, Tom Barry, Se√°n Moylan, Se√°n Mac Eoin and Ernie O'Malley) who organised guerrilla activity, largely on their own initiative. For most of the conflict, IRA activity was concentrated in Munster and Dublin, with only isolated active IRA units elsewhere, such as in County Roscommon, north County Longford and western County Mayo. While the paper membership of the IRA, carried over from the Irish Volunteers, was over 100,000 men, Michael Collins estimated that only 15,000 were active in the IRA during the course of the war, with about 3,000 on active service at any time. There were also support organisations Cumann na mBan (the IRA women's group) and Fianna √âireann (youth movement), who carried weapons and intelligence for IRA men and secured food and lodgings for them. The IRA benefitted from the widespread help given to them by the general Irish population, who generally refused to pass information to the RIC and the British military and who often provided \\"safe houses\\" and provisions to IRA units \\"on the run\\". Much of the IRA's popularity arose from the excessive reaction of the British forces to IRA activity. When √âamon de Valera returned from the United States, he demanded in the D√°il that the IRA desist from the ambushes and assassinations, which were allowing the British to portray it as a terrorist group and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. The proposal was immediately dismissed. =Martial law= A group of \\"Black and Tans\\" and Auxiliaries in Dublin, April 1921 The British increased the use of force; reluctant to deploy the regular British Army into the country in greater numbers, they set up two auxiliary police units to reinforce the RIC. The first of these, quickly nicknamed as the Black and Tans, were seven thousand strong and mainly ex-British soldiers demobilised after World War I. Deployed to Ireland in March 1920, most came from English and Scottish cities. While officially they were part of the RIC, in reality they were a paramilitary force. After their deployment in March 1920, they rapidly gained a reputation for drunkenness and poor discipline. The wartime experience of most Black and Tans did not suit them for police duties and their violent behavior antagonised many previously neutral civilians. In response to and retaliation for IRA actions, in the summer of 1920, the Tans burned and sacked numerous small towns throughout Ireland, including Balbriggan, Trim, Templemore and others. In July 1920, another quasi-military police body, the Auxiliaries, consisting of 2,215 former British army officers, arrived in Ireland. The Auxiliary Division had a reputation just as bad as the Tans for their mistreatment of the civilian population but tended to be more effective and more willing to take on the IRA. The policy of reprisals, which involved public denunciation or denial and private approval, was famously satirised by Lord Hugh Cecil when he said: \\"It seems to be agreed that there is no such thing as reprisals but they are having a good effect.\\"Richard Bennett, The Black and Tans, E Hulton and Co Ltd, London, 1959, p. 107, . On 9 August 1920, the British Parliament passed the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act. It replaced the trial by jury by courts-martial by regulation for those areas where IRA activity was prevalent. On 10 December 1920, martial law was proclaimed in Counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary in Munster; in January 1921 martial law was extended to the rest of Munster in Counties Clare and Waterford, as well as counties Kilkenny and Wexford in Leinster. It also suspended all coroners' courts because of the large number of warrants served on members of the British forces and replaced them with \\"military courts of enquiry\\". The powers of military courts-martial were extended to cover the whole population and were empowered to use the death penalty and internment without trial; Government payments to local governments in Sinn F√©in hands were suspended. This act has been interpreted by historians as a choice by Prime Minister David Lloyd George to put down the rebellion in Ireland rather than negotiate with the republican leadership.Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p. 65, Hopkinson has characterised the Act as a \\"halfway house to martial law\\". As a result, violence escalated steadily from that summer and sharply after November 1920 until July 1921. (It was in this period that a mutiny broke out among the Connaught Rangers, stationed in India. Two were killed whilst trying to storm an armoury and one was later executed.) =Escalation: October‚ÄìDecember 1920= British soldiers and relatives of the victims outside Jervis Street Hospital during the military enquiry into the Bloody Sunday shootings at Croke Park A number of events dramatically escalated the conflict in late 1920. First the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, died on hunger strike in Brixton Prison in London in October, while two other IRA prisoners on hunger strike, Joe Murphy and Michael Fitzgerald, died in Cork Jail. Sunday, 21 November 1920, was a day of dramatic bloodshed in Dublin. In the early morning, Collins' Squad attempted to wipe out leading British intelligence operatives in the capital, in particular the Cairo Gang, killing 16 men (including two cadets, one alleged informer, and one possible case of mistaken identity) and wounding 5 others. The attacks took place at different places (hotels and lodgings) in Dublin. In response, RIC men drove in trucks into Croke Park (Dublin's GAA football and hurling ground) during a football match, shooting into the crowd. Fourteen civilians were killed, including one of the players, Michael Hogan, and a further 65 people were wounded.Michael Collins by Tim Pat Coogan (), p. 144. Later that day two republican prisoners, Dick McKee, Peadar Clancy and an unassociated friend, Conor Clune who had been arrested with them, were killed in Dublin Castle. The official account was that the three men were shot \\"while trying to escape\\", which was rejected by Irish nationalists, who were certain the men had been tortured then murdered.The Secret Army: The IRA by J. Bowyer Bell (), p. 23.Michael Collins's Intelligence War by Michael T. Foy (), p. 167. For all of the above reasons, this day became known as Bloody Sunday. On 28 November 1920, one week later, the West Cork unit of the IRA, under Tom Barry, ambushed a patrol of Auxiliaries at Kilmichael in County Cork, killing all but one of the 18-man patrol. These actions marked a significant escalation of the conflict. In response, the counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary ‚Äì all in the province of Munster ‚Äì were put under martial law on 10 December under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act; this was followed on 5 January in the rest of Munster and in counties Kilkenny and Wexford in the province of Leinster. Shortly afterwards, in January 1921, \\"official reprisals\\" were sanctioned by the British and they began with the burning of seven houses in Midleton, County Cork. Aftermath of the burning of Cork by British forces On 11 December, the centre of Cork City was burnt out by the Black and Tans, who then shot at firefighters trying to tackle the blaze, in reprisal for an IRA ambush in the city on 11 December 1920 which killed one Auxiliary and wounded eleven.Tom Barry: IRA Freedom Fighter by Meda Ryan (), p. 98. Attempts at a truce in December 1920 were scuppered by Hamar Greenwood, who insisted on a surrender of IRA weapons first. =Peak of violence: December 1920 ‚Äì July 1921= During the following eight months until the Truce of July 1921, there was a spiralling of the death toll in the conflict, with 1,000 people including the RIC police, army, IRA volunteers and civilians, being killed in the months between January and July 1921 alone.Ryan (above) quotes Lionel Curtis, political advisor to Lloyd George, writing in early 1921 \\"Protestants in the south do not complain of persecution on sectarian grounds. If Protestant farmers are murdered, it is not by reason of their religion, but rather because they are under suspicion as Loyalist. The distinction is fine, but a real one.\\" Nevertheless, between 1911 and 1926, the territory of the Free State lost 34 percent of its (small) Protestant population to migration. This represents about 70% of the total casualties for the entire three-year conflict. In addition, 4,500 IRA personnel (or suspected sympathisers) were interned in this time.(M.E. Collins, Ireland p. 265). In the middle of this violence, de Valera (as President of D√°il √âireann) acknowledged the state of war with Britain in March 1921. Between 1 November 1920 and 7 June 1921 twenty-four men were executed by the British.Irish Political Prisoners 1848‚Äì 1922 by Se√°n McConville (), p. 697. The first IRA volunteer to be executed was Kevin Barry, one of The Forgotten Ten who were buried in unmarked graves in unconsecrated ground inside Mountjoy Prison until 2001.Irish Rebury 10 Republicans Hanged by British in 1920s 15 October 2001 New York Times : Accessed 1 November 2008. On 1 February, the first execution under martial law of an IRA man took place: Cornelius Murphy, of Millstreet in County Cork, was shot in Cork City. On 28 February, six more were executed, again in Cork. On 19 March 1921, Tom Barry's 100-strong West Cork IRA unit fought an action against 1,200 British troops ‚Äì the Crossbarry Ambush. Barry's men narrowly avoided being trapped by converging British columns and inflicted between ten and thirty killed on the British side. Just two days later, on 21 March, the Kerry IRA attacked a train at the Headford junction near Killarney. Twenty British soldiers were killed or injured, as well as two IRA men and three civilians. Most of the actions in the war were on a smaller scale than this, but the IRA did have other significant victories in ambushes, for example at Millstreet in Cork and at Scramogue in Roscommon, also in March 1921 and at Tourmakeady and Carowkennedy in Mayo in May and June. Equally common, however, were failed ambushes, the worst of which, for example at Mourneabbey, Upton and Clonmult in Cork in February 1921, saw six, three, and twelve IRA men killed respectively and more captured. The IRA in Mayo suffered a comparable reverse at Kilmeena, while the Leitrim flying column was almost wiped out at Selton Hill. Fears of informers after such failed ambushes often led to a spate of IRA shootings of informers, real and imagined. The biggest single loss for the IRA, however, came in Dublin. On 25 May 1921, several hundred IRA men from the Dublin Brigade occupied and burned the Custom House (the centre of local government in Ireland) in Dublin city centre. Symbolically, this was intended to show that British rule in Ireland was untenable. However, from a military point of view, it was a heavy defeat in which five IRA men were killed and over eighty captured. This showed the IRA was not well enough equipped or trained to take on British forces in a conventional manner. However, it did not, as is sometimes claimed, cripple the IRA in Dublin. The Dublin Brigade carried out 107 attacks in the city in May and 93 in June, showing a falloff in activity, but not a dramatic one. However, by July 1921, most IRA units were chronically short of both weapons and ammunition, with over 3,000 prisoners interned.Foy (2013), p. 198 Also, for all their effectiveness at guerrilla warfare, they had, as Richard Mulcahy recalled, \\"as yet not been able to drive the enemy out of anything but a fairly good sized police barracks\\".Dorothy McArdle, The Irish Republic, p. 568. Still, many military historians have concluded that the IRA fought a largely successful and lethal guerrilla war, which forced the British government to conclude that the IRA could not be defeated militarily.According to historian Michael Hopkinson, the guerrilla warfare, \\"was often courageous and effective\\" (Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p202). Another historian, David Fitzpatrick notes that, \\"The guerrilla fighters... were vastly outnumbered by the forces of the Crown... the success of the Irish Volunteers in surviving so long is therefore noteworthy\\" (Bartlett, Military History of Ireland, p. 406). The failure of the British efforts to put down the guerrillas was illustrated by the events of \\"Black Whitsun\\" on 13‚Äì15 May 1921. A general election for the Parliament of Southern Ireland was held on 13 May. Sinn F√©in won 124 of the new parliament's 128 seats unopposed, but its elected members refused to take their seats. Under the terms of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the Parliament of Southern Ireland was therefore dissolved, and executive and legislative authority over Southern Ireland was effectively transferred to the Lord Lieutenant (assisted by Crown appointees). Over the next two days (14‚Äì15 May), the IRA killed fifteen policemen. These events marked the complete failure of the British Coalition Government's Irish policy‚Äîboth the failure to enforce a settlement without negotiating with Sinn F√©in and a failure to defeat the IRA. By the time of the truce, however, many republican leaders, including Michael Collins, were convinced that if the war went on for much longer, there was a chance that the IRA campaign as it was then organised could be brought to a standstill. Because of this, plans were drawn up to \\"bring the war to England\\". The IRA did take the campaign to the streets of Glasgow.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/battle-of- rottenrow-960788 It was decided that key economic targets, such as the Liverpool docks, would be bombed. The units charged with these missions would more easily evade capture because England was not under, and British public opinion was unlikely to accept, martial law. These plans were abandoned because of the truce. Truce: July‚ÄìDecember 1921 A crowd gathers at the Mansion House in Dublin in the days before the truce The war of independence in Ireland ended with a truce on 11 July 1921. The conflict had reached a stalemate. Talks that had looked promising the previous year had petered out in December when David Lloyd George insisted that the IRA first surrender their arms. Fresh talks, after the Prime Minister had come under pressure from H. H. Asquith and the Liberal opposition, the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, resumed in the spring and resulted in the Truce. From the point of view of the British government, it appeared as if the IRA's guerrilla campaign would continue indefinitely, with spiralling costs in British casualties and in money. More importantly, the British government was facing severe criticism at home and abroad for the actions of British forces in Ireland. On 6 June 1921, the British made their first conciliatory gesture, calling off the policy of house burnings as reprisals. On the other side, IRA leaders and in particular Michael Collins, felt that the IRA as it was then organised could not continue indefinitely. It had been hard pressed by the deployment of more regular British soldiers to Ireland and by the lack of arms and ammunition. The initial breakthrough that led to the truce was credited to three people: King George V, Prime Minister of South Africa General Jan Smuts and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George. The King, who had made his unhappiness at the behaviour of the Black and Tans in Ireland well known to his government, was dissatisfied with the official speech prepared for him for the opening of the new Parliament of Northern Ireland, created as a result of the partition of Ireland. Smuts, a close friend of the King, suggested to him that the opportunity should be used to make an appeal for conciliation in Ireland. The King asked him to draft his ideas on paper. Smuts prepared this draft and gave copies to the King and to Lloyd George. Lloyd George then invited Smuts to attend a British cabinet meeting consultations on the \\"interesting\\" proposals Lloyd George had received, without either man informing the Cabinet that Smuts had been their author. Faced with the endorsement of them by Smuts, the King and the Prime Minister, ministers reluctantly agreed to the King's planned 'reconciliation in Ireland' speech. The speech, when delivered in Belfast on 22 June, was universally well received. It called on \\"all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land they love a new era of peace, contentment, and good will.\\"Britain Between the Wars, 1918‚Äì40 by Charles Loch Mowat (), pp. 84‚Äì85. On 24 June 1921, the British Coalition Government's Cabinet decided to propose talks with the leader of Sinn F√©in. Coalition Liberals and Unionists agreed that an offer to negotiate would strengthen the Government's position if Sinn F√©in refused. Austen Chamberlain, the new leader of the Unionist Party, said that \\"the King's Speech ought to be followed up as a last attempt at peace before we go the full lengths of martial law\\".The Austen Chamberlain Diary Letters by Austen Chamberlain (), p. 161. Seizing the momentum, Lloyd George wrote to √âamon de Valera as \\"the chosen leader of the great majority in Southern Ireland\\" on 24 June, suggesting a conference.Negotiations June‚ÄìSeptember 1921. UCC online ‚Äì accessed Dec 2009. Sinn F√©in responded by agreeing to talks. De Valera and Lloyd George ultimately agreed to a truce that was intended to end the fighting and lay the ground for detailed negotiations. Its terms were signed on 9 July and came into effect on 11 July. Negotiations on a settlement, however, were delayed for some months as the British government insisted that the IRA first decommission its weapons, but this demand was eventually dropped. It was agreed that British troops would remain confined to their barracks. Most IRA officers on the ground interpreted the Truce merely as a temporary respite and continued recruiting and training volunteers. Nor did attacks on the RIC or British Army cease altogether. Between December 1921 and February of the next year, there were 80 recorded attacks by the IRA on the soon to be disbanded RIC, leaving 12 dead.Niall C. Harrington Kerry Landing, p. 8. On 18 February 1922, Ernie O'Malley's IRA unit raided the RIC barracks at Clonmel, taking 40 policemen prisoner and seizing over 600 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition.Harrington p. 10. In April 1922, in the Dunmanway killings, an IRA party in Cork killed 10 local suspected Protestant informers in retaliation for the shooting of one of their men. Those killed were named in captured British files as informers before the Truce signed the previous July.Meda Ryan, Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter, p. 157. Over 100 Protestant families fled the area after the killings. The continuing resistance of many IRA leaders was one of the main factors in the outbreak of the Irish Civil War as they refused to accept the Anglo-Irish Treaty that Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith had negotiated with the British. Treaty Members of the Irish negotiation committee returning to Ireland in December 1921 Ultimately, the peace talks led to the negotiation of the Anglo- Irish Treaty (6 December 1921), which was then ratified in triplicate: by D√°il √âireann on 7 January 1922 (so giving it legal legitimacy under the governmental system of the Irish Republic), by the House of Commons of Southern Ireland in January 1922 (so giving it constitutional legitimacy according to British theory of who was the legal government in Ireland), and by both Houses of the British parliament. The treaty allowed Northern Ireland, which had been created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, to opt out of the Free State if it wished, which it duly did on 8 December 1922 under the procedures laid down. As agreed, an Irish Boundary Commission was then created to decide on the precise location of the border of the Free State and Northern Ireland. The republican negotiators understood that the commission would redraw the border according to local nationalist or unionist majorities. Since the 1920 local elections in Ireland had resulted in outright nationalist majorities in County Fermanagh, County Tyrone, the City of Derry and in many District Electoral Divisions of County Armagh and County Londonderry (all north and west of the \\"interim\\" border), this might well have left Northern Ireland unviable. However, the Commission chose to leave the border unchanged; as a trade-off, the money owed to Britain by the Free State under the Treaty was not demanded. A new system of government was created for the new Irish Free State, though for the first year two governments co-existed; an Aireacht answerable to the D√°il and headed by President Griffith, and a Provisional Government nominally answerable to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and appointed by the Lord Lieutenant. Most of the Irish independence movement's leaders were willing to accept this compromise, at least for the time being, though many militant republicans were not. A majority of the pre- Truce IRA who had fought in the War of Independence, led by Liam Lynch, refused to accept the Treaty and in March 1922 repudiated the authority of the D√°il and the new Free State government, which it accused of betraying the ideal of the Irish Republic. It also broke the Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Republic which the D√°il had instated on 20 August 1919. The anti-treaty IRA were supported by the former president of the Republic, √âamon de Valera, and ministers Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack. The funeral of Michael Collins St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Dublin, August 1922 While the violence in the North was still raging, the South of Ireland was preoccupied with the split in the D√°il and in the IRA over the treaty. In April 1922, an executive of IRA officers repudiated the treaty and the authority of the Provisional Government which had been set up to administer it. These republicans held that the D√°il did not have the right to disestablish the Irish Republic. A hardline group of Anti-Treaty IRA men occupied several public buildings in Dublin in an effort to bring down the treaty and restart the war with the British. There were a number of armed confrontations between pro and anti-treaty troops before matters came to a head in late June 1922. Desperate to get the new Irish Free State off the ground and under British pressure, Michael Collins attacked the anti-treaty militants in Dublin, causing fighting to break out around the country. The subsequent Irish Civil War lasted until mid-1923 and cost the lives of many of the leaders of the independence movement, notably the head of the Provisional Government Michael Collins, ex-minister Cathal Brugha, and anti-treaty republicans Harry Boland, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Liam Lynch and many others: total casualties have never been determined but were perhaps higher than those in the earlier fighting against the British. President Arthur Griffith also died of a cerebral haemorrhage during the conflict. Following the deaths of Griffith and Collins, W. T. Cosgrave became head of government. On 6 December 1922, following the coming into legal existence of the Irish Free State, W. T. Cosgrave became President of the Executive Council, the first internationally recognised head of an independent Irish government. The civil war ended in mid-1923 in defeat for the anti-treaty side. North-east thumbConflict deaths in Belfast 1920‚Äì1922. James Craig, later Viscount Craigavon, 1st Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Craig tacitly approved of \\"organised reprisals\\" on nationalists for IRA attacks. In the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (enacted in December 1920), the British government attempted to solve the conflict by creating two Home Rule parliaments in Ireland: Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. While D√°il √âireann ignored this, deeming the Irish Republic to be already in existence, Unionists in the north-east accepted it and prepared to form their own government. In this part of Ireland, which was predominantly Protestant and Unionist, there was, as a result, a very different pattern of violence from the rest of the country. Whereas in the south and west, the conflict was between the IRA and British forces, in the north-east and particularly in Belfast, it often developed into a cycle of sectarian killings between Catholics, who were largely Nationalist, and Protestants, who were mostly Unionist. =Summer 1920= While IRA attacks were less common in the north-east than elsewhere, the unionist community saw itself as being besieged by armed Catholic nationalists who seemed to have taken over the rest of Ireland. As a result, they retaliated against the northern Catholic community as a whole. Such action was largely condoned by the unionist leadership and abetted by state forces. James Craig, for instance, wrote in 1920: > The Loyalist rank and file have determined to take action... they now feel > the situation is so desperate that unless the Government will take immediate > action, it may be advisable for them to see what steps can be taken towards > a system of 'organised' reprisals against the rebels.(Hopkinson, Irish War > of Independence, p. 158). The first cycle of attacks and reprisals broke out in the summer of 1920. On 19 June a week of inter-sectarian rioting and sniping started in Derry, resulting in 18 deaths.Irish Times 24 June 1920; reprinted 24 June 2009. On 17 July 1920, a British Colonel Gerald Smyth was assassinated by the IRA in the County Club in Cork city in response to a speech that was made to police officers of Listowel who had refused orders to move into the more urban areas, in which he stated \\"you may make mistakes occasionally, and innocent persons may be shot, but that cannot be helped. No policeman will get in trouble for shooting any man\\".Michael Collins's Intelligence War by Michael T. Foy (), p. 91.Constable Jeremiah Mee, leader of the mutiny among the police officers, suggested in a publication of the Sinn F√©in newspaper Irish Bulletin, that Smyth had said that the officers should shoot IRA suspects on sight. In reality, Order No. 5, which Smyth had already said to colleagues that he was going to read out to the officers, said that IRA suspects should be shot as a last resort if the IRA men didn't surrender when challenged. This episode, along with the mutiny, has come down to be known as the Listowel mutiny. Smyth came from Banbridge, County Down in the north-east and his killing provoked retaliation there against Catholics in Banbridge and Dromore. On 21 July 1920, partly in response to the killing of Smyth and partly because of competition over jobs due to the high unemployment rate, loyalists marched on the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast and forced over 7,000 Catholic and left-wing Protestant workers from their jobs.D√°il Debate, \\"Belfast\\", 6 August 1920 Sectarian rioting broke out in response in Belfast and Derry, resulting in about 40 deaths and many Catholics and Protestants being expelled from their homes. On 22 August 1920, RIC Detective Swanzy was shot dead by Cork IRA men while leaving church in Lisburn, County Antrim. Swanzy had been blamed by an inquest jury for the killing of Cork Mayor Tom√°s Mac Curtain. In revenge, local Loyalists burned Catholic residential areas of Lisburn ‚Äì destroying over 300 homes. While several people were later prosecuted for the burnings, no attempt seems to have been made to halt the attacks at the time. Michael Collins, acting on a suggestion by Se√°n MacEntee, organised a boycott of Belfast goods in response to the attacks on the Catholic community. The D√°il approved a partial boycott on 6 August and a more complete one was implemented by the end of 1920. =Spring 1921= After a lull in violence in the north over the new year, killings there intensified again in the spring of 1921. The northern IRA units came under pressure from the leadership in Dublin to step up attacks in line with the rest of the country. Predictably, this unleashed loyalist reprisals against Catholics. For example, in April 1921, the IRA in Belfast shot dead two Auxiliaries in Donegal Place in Belfast city centre. The same night, two Catholics were killed on the Falls Road. On 10 July 1921 the IRA ambushed British forces in Raglan street in Belfast. In the following week, sixteen Catholics were killed and 216 Catholic homes burned in reprisal ‚Äì events known as Belfast's Bloody Sunday. Killings on the loyalist side were largely carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), allegedly with the aid of the RIC and especially the auxiliary police force, the Ulster Special Constabulary or \\"B-Specials\\". The Special Constabulary (set up in September 1920), was largely recruited from Ulster Volunteer Force and Orange Lodges and, in the words of historian Michael Hopkinson, \\"amounted to an officially approved UVF\\".Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 158. In May James Craig came to Dublin to meet the British Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord FitzAlan, and was smuggled by the IRA through Dublin to meet √âamon de Valera. The two leaders discussed the possibility of a truce in Ulster and an amnesty for prisoners. Craig proposed a compromise settlement based on the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, with limited independence for the South and autonomy for the North within a Home Rule context. However, the talks came to nothing and violence in the north continued.Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 162. =July 1921 ‚Äì May 1922= While the fighting in the south was largely ended by the Truce on 11 July 1921, in the north killings continued and actually escalated until the summer of 1922. In Belfast, 16 people were killed in the two days after the truce alone. The violence in the city took place in bursts, as attacks on both Catholics and Protestants were rapidly followed by reprisals on the other community. In this way, 20 people died in street fighting and assassinations in north and west Belfast over 29 August to 1 September 1921 and another 30 from 21‚Äì25 November. Loyalists had by this time taken to firing and throwing bombs randomly into Catholic areas and the IRA responded by bombing trams which took Protestant workers to their places of employment.Alan F Parkinson, Belfast's Unholy War, hbk p. 316. Moreover, despite the D√°il's acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922, which confirmed the future existence of Northern Ireland, there were clashes between the IRA and British forces along the new border from early 1922. In part, this reflected Michael Collins' view that the Treaty was a tactical move, or \\"stepping stone\\", rather than a final settlement. A number of IRA men were arrested in Derry when they travelled there as part of the Monaghan Gaelic football team. In retaliation, Michael Collins had forty-two loyalists taken hostage in Fermanagh and Tyrone. Right after this incident, a group of B-Specials were confronted by an IRA unit at Clones in Southern territory, who demanded that they surrender. The IRA unit's leader was shot dead and a gun battle broke out, in which four Special Constables were killed. The withdrawal of British troops from Ireland was temporarily suspended as a result of this event. Despite the setting up of a Border Commission to mediate between the two sides in late February, the IRA raided three British barracks along the border in March. All of these actions provoked retaliatory killings in Belfast. In the two days after the Fermanagh kidnappings, 30 people lost their lives in the city, including four Catholic children and two women who were killed by a Loyalist bomb on Weaver Street. In March, 60 died in Belfast, including six members of the Catholic McMahon family, who were targeted for assassination by members of the Special Constabulary in revenge for the IRA killing of two policemen (See McMahon murders).Parkinson, Unholy War, p. 237. In April, another 30 people died in the Northern capital, including another so called 'uniform attack', the Arnon Street massacre, when six Catholics were killed by uniformed policemen.Parkinson, Unholy War, p. 316. Winston Churchill arranged a meeting between Collins and James Craig on 21 January 1922 and the southern boycott of Belfast goods was lifted but then re-imposed after several weeks. The two leaders had several further meetings, but despite a joint declaration that \\"Peace is declared\\" on 30 March, the violence continued.Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, the Irish Civil War, pp. 79‚Äì83. =May‚ÄìJune 1922= In May and June 1922, Collins launched a guerrilla IRA offensive against Northern Ireland. By this time, the IRA was split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty, but both pro and anti-treaty units were involved in the operation. Some of the arms sent by the British to arm the new Irish Army were in fact given to IRA units and their weapons sent to the North.Hopkinson Green against Green pp. 83‚Äì86. However, the offensive, launched with a series of IRA attacks in the North on 17‚Äì19 May, ultimately proved a failure. An IRA Belfast Brigade report in late May concluded that continuing the offensive was \\"futile and foolish...the only result of the attack was to place the Catholic population at the mercy of the Specials\\".Hopkinson, Green against Green p. 86. On 22 May, after the assassination of West Belfast Unionist MP William Twaddell, 350 IRA men were arrested in Belfast, crippling its organisation there.Hopkinson, Green against Green p. 85. The largest single clash came in June, when British troops used artillery to dislodge an IRA unit from the village of Pettigo, killing seven, wounding six and taking four prisoners. This was the last major confrontation between the IRA and British forces in the period 1919‚Äì1922.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, pp. 83‚Äì87. The cycle of sectarian atrocities against civilians however continued into June 1922. May saw 75 people killed in Belfast and another 30 died there in June. Several thousand Catholics fled the violence and sought refuge in Glasgow and Dublin.for death toll and Catholic refugees; Parkinson, Unholy War, p. 316. On 17 June, in revenge for the killing of two Catholics by the B-Specials, Frank Aiken's IRA unit shot ten Protestant civilians, killing six in and around Altnaveigh, south Armagh. Three Special Constables were also killed in the shootings.Lynch, Northern IRA pp. 147‚Äì48. Michael Collins held the British Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson (by then MP for North Down) responsible for the attacks on Catholics in the north and may have been behind his assassination in June 1922, though who ordered the shooting is unproven.Hopkinson, Green against Green, pp. 112‚Äì113. The event helped to trigger the Irish Civil War. Winston Churchill insisted after the killing that Collins take action against the Anti-Treaty IRA, whom he assumed to be responsible.Hopkinson, Green against Green, pp. 115‚Äì116. The outbreak of the civil war in the South ended the violence in the North, as the war demoralised the IRA in the north east and distracted the attention of the rest of the organisation from the question of partition. After Collins' death in August 1922, the new Irish Free State quietly ended Collins' policy of covert armed action in Northern Ireland. The violence in the north fizzled out by late 1922, the last reported killing of the conflict in what was now Northern Ireland took place on 5 October.Parkinson, Unholy War, p. 316. Detention During the 1920s, the vessel was used as a military base and prison ship for the holding of Irish Republicans by the British government as part of their internment strategy after Bloody Sunday. Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 internees, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result. There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923.Kleinrichert, Denise, Republican Internment and the Prison Ship \\"Argenta\\", 1922 (September 2000), Irish Academic Press Ltd. By February 1923, under the 1922 Special Powers Act the British were detaining 263 men on Argenta, which was moored in Belfast Lough. This was supplemented with internment at other land based sites such as Larne workhouse, Belfast Prison and Derry Gaol. Together, both the ship and the workhouse alone held 542 men without trial at the highest internment population level during June 1923. Propaganda war The symbol of the Republic: The Irish tricolour which dated back to the Young Ireland rebellion of 1848. A symbol of British rule: The standard of the Lord Lieutenant, using the union flag created under the Act of Union 1800. Another feature of the war was the use of propaganda by both sides. The British government also collected material on the liaison between Sinn F√©in and Soviet Russia, in an unsuccessful attempt to portray Sinn F√©in as a crypto-communist movement.\\"Intercourse between Bolshevism and Sinn F√©in\\", Cmd. 1326 (HMSO, London, 1921). The Catholic Church hierarchy was critical of the violence of both sides, but especially that of the IRA, continuing a long tradition of condemning militant republicanism. The Bishop of Kilmore, Dr. Finnegan, said: \\"Any war... to be just and lawful must be backed by a well grounded hope of success. What hope of success have you against the mighty forces of the British Empire? None... none whatever and if it unlawful as it is, every life taken in pursuance of it is murder.\\"Raids and Rallies by Ernie O'Malley (), p. 96. Thomas Gilmartin, the Archbishop of Tuam, issued a letter saying that IRA men who took part in ambushes \\"have broken the truce of God, they have incurred the guilt of murder.\\"Raids and Rallies by Ernie O'Malley (), p. 97. However, in May 1921, Pope Benedict XV dismayed the British government when he issued a letter that exhorted the \\"English as well as Irish to calmly consider . . . some means of mutual agreement\\", as they had been pushing for a condemnation of the rebellion.Michael Collins by Tim Pat Coogan (), p. 204. They declared that his comments \\"put HMG (His Majesty's Government) and the Irish murder gang on a footing of equality\\". Desmond FitzGerald and Erskine Childers were active in producing the Irish Bulletin, which detailed government atrocities which Irish and British newspapers were unwilling or unable to cover. It was printed secretly and distributed throughout Ireland, and to international press agencies and US, European and sympathetic British politicians. While the military war made most of Ireland ungovernable from early 1920, it did not actually remove British forces from any part. But the success of Sinn F√©in's propaganda campaign reduced the option of the British government to deepen the conflict; it worried in particular about the effect on British relations with the US, where groups like the American Committee for Relief in Ireland had so many eminent members. The British cabinet had not sought the war that had developed since 1919. By 1921 one of its members, Winston Churchill, reflected: > What was the alternative? It was to plunge one small corner of the empire > into an iron repression, which could not be carried out without an admixture > of murder and counter-murder.... Only national self-preservation could have > excused such a policy, and no reasonable man could allege that self- > preservation was involved.W. Churchill, The Aftermath (Thornton 1929) p. > 297. Casualties Monument to IRA fighters in Phibsborough, Dublin The total number killed in the guerrilla war of 1919‚Äì21 between republicans and British forces in what became the Irish Free State came to over 1,400. Of these, 363 were police personnel, 261 were from the regular British Army, about 550 were IRA volunteers (including 24 official executions), and about 200 were civilians. Some other sources give higher figures.The Police Service of Northern Ireland, successor to the RIC via the RUC, lists the figures of RIC killed as 418, with 146 British soldiers killed. One in twenty of the RIC dead with one in twelve wounded. See figures available here . On 21 November 1921 the British army held a memorial service for its dead, of all ranks, of which it counted 162 up to the 1921 Truce and 18 killed afterwards.Dublin Historical Record 1998 Vol 51, p. 17. A number of these are buried in the Grangegorman Military Cemetery. 557 people died in political violence in what would become Northern Ireland between July 1920 and July 1922. This death toll is usually counted separately from the southern casualties, as many of these deaths took place after the 11 July truce that ended fighting in the rest of Ireland. Of these deaths, between 303 and 340 were Catholic civilians, 35 were IRA men, between 172 and 196 were Protestant civilians and 82 were British forces personnel (38 were RIC and 44 were Ulster Special Constables). The majority of the violence took place in Belfast: 452 people were killed there ‚Äì 267 Catholics and 185 Protestants.Richard English, Armed Struggle, a History of the IRA, pp. 39‚Äì40. Robert Lynch, The Northern IRA and the Early Years of Partition, pp. 227, p. 67. Irish nationalists have argued that this northern violence represented a pogrom against their community as 58% of the victims were Catholics, even though Catholics were only around 35% of the population. Historian of the period Alan Parkinson has suggested that the term 'pogrom' is 'unhelpful and misleading in explaining the events of the period' as the violence was not state directed or one sided.'despite disproportionate loss of life and serious injury among the Catholic community, there were also hundreds of Protestant dead and injured'. Also he argues that 'co-ordination of the murder campaign was not executed by the official administration for the area and many killings appeared to have been done in a random and reactive fashion'. Parkinson, Unholy War, p. 314. Similarly in recent decades, attention has been drawn to the IRA's shooting of civilian informers in the south. Several historians, notably Peter Hart have alleged that those killed in this manner were often simply considered \\"enemies\\" rather than being proven informers. Especially vulnerable, it is argued, were Protestants, ex-soldiers and tramps. \\"It was not merely (or even mainly) a matter of espionage, spies and spy hunters, it was a civil war between and within communities\\".Hart, IRA and its Enemies, p. 314. Particularly controversial in this regard has been the Dunmanway killings of April 1922, when ten Protestants were killed and three \\"disappeared\\" over two nights. Hart's contentions have been challenged by a number of historians, notably Niall Meehan and Meda Ryan.Ryan, Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter, 2005 Post-war evacuation of British forces Soldiers of a British cavalry regiment leaving Dublin in 1922 By October 1921 the British Army in Ireland numbered 57,000 men, along with 14,200 RIC police and some 2,600 auxiliaries and Black and Tans. The long-planned evacuation from dozens of barracks in what the army called \\"Southern Ireland\\" started on 12 January 1922, following the ratification of the Treaty and took nearly a year, organised by General Nevil Macready. It was a huge logistical operation, but within the month Dublin Castle and Beggars Bush Barracks were transferred to the Provisional Government. The RIC last paraded on 4 April and was formally disbanded on 31 August. By the end of May the remaining forces were concentrated in Dublin, Cork and Kildare. Tensions that led to the Irish Civil War were evident by then and evacuation was suspended. By November about 6,600 soldiers remained in Dublin at 17 locations. Finally on 17 December 1922 The Royal Barracks (now housing collections of the National Museum of Ireland) was transferred to General Richard Mulcahy and the garrison embarked at Dublin Port that evening.Dublin Historical Record 1998, vol.51 pp. 4‚Äì24. Compensation In May 1922 the British Government with the agreement of the Irish Provisional Government established a commission chaired by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline to examine compensation claims for material damage caused between 21 January 1919 and 11 July 1921. The Irish Free State's Damage To Property (Compensation) Act, 1923 provided that only the Shaw Commission, and not the Criminal Injury Acts, could be used to claim compensation. Originally, the British government paid claims from unionists and the Irish government those from nationalists; claims from \\"neutral\\" parties were shared. After the 1925 collapse of the Irish Boundary Commission, the UK, Free State and Northern Ireland governments negotiated revisions to the 1921 treaty; the Free State stopped contributing to the servicing of the UK national debt, but took over full responsibility for compensation for war damage, with the fund increased by 10% in 1926. The \\"Compensation (Ireland) Commission\\" worked until March 1926, processing thousands of claims. Role of women in the war Constance Markievicz was a member of the Irish Citizen Army and fought in the Easter Rising. In 1919 she was appointed Minister for Labour in the Government of the Irish Republic Although most of the fighting was carried out by men, women played a substantial supporting role in the Irish War of Independence. Before the Easter Rising of 1916, many Irish nationalist women were brought together through organisations fighting for women's suffrage, such as the Irish Women's Franchise League. The republican socialist Irish Citizen Army promoted gender equality and many of these women‚Äîincluding Constance Markiewicz, Madeleine ffrench-Mullen, and Kathleen Lynn‚Äîjoined the group. In 1914, the all-female paramilitary group Cumann na mBan was launched as an auxiliary of the Irish Volunteers. During the Easter Rising, some women participated in fighting and carried messages between Irish Volunteer posts while being shot at by British troops. After the rebel defeat, √âamon de Valera opposed the participation of women in combat and they were limited to supporting roles. During the conflict, women hid IRA volunteers being sought by the British, nursed wounded volunteers, and gathered money to help republican prisoners and their families. Cumann na mBan engaged in undercover work to set back the British war effort. They smuggled guns, ammunition, and money to the IRA, such as Kathleen Clarke, who reported \\"smuggling ¬£2,000 of gold from Limerick city to Dublin for IRA leader Michael Collins\\". Because they sheltered wanted men, many women were subject to raids on their homes by British police and soldiers, with acts of sexual violence sometimes being reported but not confirmed. It is estimated that there were between 3,000 and 9,000 members of Cumann na mBan during the war, and in 1921 there were 800 branches throughout the island. It is estimated that fewer than 50 women were imprisoned by the British during the war. Memorial A memorial called the Garden of Remembrance was erected in Dublin in 1966, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising. The date of signing of the truce is commemorated by the National Day of Commemoration, when all those Irish men and women who fought in wars in specific armies (e.g., the Irish unit(s) fighting in the British Army in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme) are commemorated. The last survivor of the conflict, Dan Keating (of the IRA), died in October 2007 at the age of 105.

The four symbols shown indicate that the garment must not be washed in water, must not be bleached, may be ironed only with a protective pressing cloth, and must be dry cleaned. A poster from a laundromat in Beckley, West Virginia, that lists many of the common laundering instruction icons found on garment tags A laundry symbol, also called a care symbol, is a pictogram which represents a method of washing, for example drying, dry-cleaning and ironing clothing. Such symbols are written on labels, known as care labels or care tags, attached to clothing to indicate how a particular item should best be cleaned. Standard symbols for these care labels differ by region. In some standards, pictograms coexist with or are complemented by written instructions. The Canadian system was formerly based on color: green for \\"go ahead\\", yellow for \\"be careful\\", and red for \\"stop\\". That system was abandoned in favor of a common North American scheme. Although there is an international standard that has been agreed by the ISO and within Europe by the EU, copyright laws make it difficult to publish these widely. However, there have been attempts to summarize the main national and international standards.  Europe  GINETEX, based in France, is the European association for textile care labeling, and formed in 1963 after academic conferences in the late 1950s were formed to define one standard of labeling. = General = The care label describes the allowable treatment of the garment without damaging the textile. Whether this treatment is necessary or sufficient, is not stated. A milder than specified treatment is always acceptable. The symbols are protected and their use is required to comply with the license conditions; incorrect labeling is prohibited. A bar below each symbol calls for a gentler treatment than usual and a double bar for a very gentle treatment. = Washing = A stylized washtub is shown, and the number in the tub means the maximum wash temperature (degrees Celsius). A bar under the tub signifies a gentler treatment in the washing machine. A double bar signifies very gentle handling. A hand in the tub signifies that only (gentle) hand washing (not above 40 ¬∞C) is allowed. A cross through washtub means that the textile may not be washed under normal household conditions. In the European standard, the level of wash agitation recommended is indicated by bars below the washtub symbol. Absence of bar indicates a maximum agitation (cotton wash), a single bar indicates medium agitation (synthetics cycle) and a double bar indicates very minimal agitation (silk/wool cycle). The bar symbols also indicate the level of spin recommended with more bars indicating lower preferred spin speed.

The original line-up consisted of vocalist Ian McCulloch, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson. By 1980, Pete de Freitas joined as the band's drummer. Their 1980 debut album, Crocodiles, went into the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart. After releasing their second album, Heaven Up Here in 1981, the band's cult status was followed by mainstream success in the UK in 1983, when they scored a UK Top 10 hit with \\"The Cutter\\", and the album which the song came from, Porcupine, hit number 2 in the UK. Ocean Rain (1984), continued the band's UK chart success with its lead single \\"The Killing Moon\\" entering into the top ten. After releasing a self-titled album in 1987, McCulloch left the band and was replaced by former St. Vitus Dance singer Noel Burke. In 1989, de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident. After working together as Electrafixion, McCulloch and Sergeant regrouped with Pattinson in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen, before Pattinson's departure in 1998. The band has done some touring and released several albums since the late 1990s, to varying degrees of success. History=Early years= Ian McCulloch began his career in 1977, as one third of the Crucial Three, a bedroom band which also featured Julian Cope and Pete Wylie. When Wylie left, McCulloch and Cope formed the short-lived A Shallow Madness with drummer Dave Pickett and organist Paul Simpson, during which time such songs as \\"Read It in Books\\", \\"Robert Mitchum\\", \\"You Think It's Love\\" and \\"Spacehopper\\" were written by the pair. When Cope sacked McCulloch from the band, A Shallow Madness changed their name to The Teardrop Explodes, and McCulloch joined forces with guitarist Will Sergeant and bass player Les Pattinson to form Echo & the Bunnymen. This early incarnation of the band featured a drum machine, assumed by many to be \\"Echo\\", though this has been denied by the band. In the 1982 book Liverpool Explodes!, Will Sergeant explained the origin of the band's name: In November 1978, Echo & the Bunnymen made their debut at Liverpool's Eric's Club, appearing as the opening act for The Teardrop Explodes. The band played one song, a 20-minute version of \\"Monkeys\\" which was entitled \\"I Bagsy Yours\\" at the time. Echo & the Bunnymen's debut single \\"The Pictures on My Wall\\" was released on Bill Drummond & David Balfe's Zoo Records in May 1979, the B-side being the McCulloch/Cope collaboration \\"Read It in Books\\" (also recorded by The Teardrop Explodes approximately six months later as the B-side of their final Zoo Records single \\"Treason\\"). McCulloch has subsequently denied, on more than one occasion, that Cope had any involvement with the writing of this song. By the time of their debut album, 1980's Crocodiles, the drum machine had been replaced by Trinidad-born Pete de Freitas. The lead single, \\"Rescue\\", climbed to UK No.62 and the album broke into the Top 20 at No. 17, following critical acclaim. Their next album, Heaven Up Here (1981), was an even bigger critical and commercial success, reaching the UK Top Ten (No. 10), although a single lifted from the album, \\"A Promise\\", could only reach UK No. 49. =Mainstream success= In June 1982, the Bunnymen achieved their first significant UK hit single with \\"The Back of Love\\" (No. 19). In July 1982, they performed at the first WOMAD festival. This was followed in early 1983 with their first Top 10, the more radio-friendly \\"The Cutter\\", which climbed to No. 8\\\\. The parent album, Porcupine, hit No. 2 in the album chart. Now firmly established as a chart act, further hits followed with a one-off single, \\"Never Stop\\" (No. 15), and \\"The Killing Moon\\", a preview from the new album featuring a dramatic McCulloch vocal, which became the band's second UK Top 10 single at No. 9. Following a PR campaign which proclaimed it \\"the greatest album ever made\\" according to McCulloch, 1984's Ocean Rain reached No. 4, and today is widely regarded as the band's landmark album. Single extracts \\"Silver\\" (UK No. 30) and \\"Seven Seas\\" (UK No. 16) consolidated the album's continued commercial success. In the same year, McCulloch had a minor solo hit with his cover version of \\"September Song\\". Echo & the Bunnymen toured Scandinavia in April 1985, performing cover versions of songs from Television, the Rolling Stones, Talking Heads and The Doors. Recordings from the tour emerged as the semi-bootleg On Strike. Unfortunately for the band, Ocean Rain proved to be a difficult album to follow up, and they could only re-emerge in 1985 with a single, \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\" (UK No. 21), and a compilation album, Songs to Learn & Sing, which made No. 6 in the UK album chart. However, all was not well in the Bunnymen camp, and Pete de Freitas left the band. Their next album, the self-titled Echo & the Bunnymen (1987), was initially recorded with ex‚ÄìABC drummer David Palmer, but when de Freitas returned in 1986, it was largely re-recorded. Eventually released in mid-1987, the record sold well (UK No. 4), and was a small American hit, their only LP to have significant sales there. In the United States, the band's best-known songs were \\"The Killing Moon\\" and \\"Lips Like Sugar\\". \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\" is well known as one of the songs on the soundtrack to the John Hughes film Pretty in Pink. The band also contributed a cover version of The Doors song \\"People Are Strange\\" to The Lost Boys soundtrack. \\"Never Stop\\" was also used in the Alan Bennett film History Boys. =Departure of McCulloch, death of de Freitas, and disbandment= McCulloch quit the band in 1988, leading to the uncertainty of the band's future, which was exacerbated when de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident in mid-1989. After former Colenso Parade singer Oscar turned down an offer to take over from McCulloch,Larkin, Colin: \\"The Guinness Who's Who Of Indie and New Wave Music\\", page 67. Guinness Publishing, 1992, Pattinson and Sergeant recruited ex-St. Vitus Dance vocalist Noel Burke and drummer Damon Reece. Keyboardist Jake Brockman (a touring member of the band for several years previously, and a contributor to the 1987 album) was promoted to full member, and the five-piece recorded Reverberation in 1990. This did not generate much interest among fans or critics. In a 2003 interview, McCulloch said of his replacement with Burke: > I think it's pretty obvious what I think. Noel Burke... the name says it all > really doesn't it? No, that's not fair. It wasn't his fault, it was Will and > Pete who were the berks really. But no, I thought it was disgraceful and > after that I suppose it was quite surprising that I continued working with > Will after that. I'm glad I did though. Johnny Marr called them Echo and the > Bogusmen when that happened. Meanwhile, McCulloch released his debut solo album, Candleland in September 1989, shortly after de Freitas' death; the album reflected a new maturity influenced by the death of his late bandmate. His follow-up solo album was Mysterio in 1992. The group disbanded in 1993. =Reformation= Echo and the Bunnymen at Paradiso, Amsterdam, in 2006 Ian McCulloch at the Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim 2016 In 1994, McCulloch and Sergeant began working together again under the name Electrafixion; in 1997 Pattinson rejoined the duo, meaning the three surviving members of the original Bunnymen line-up were now working together again. Rather than continue as Electrafixion, the trio resurrected the Echo & the Bunnymen name and released the album Evergreen (1997), which reached the UK Top 10. Immediately prior to the release of the band's next album, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? (1999), Les Pattinson quit to take care of his mother. McCulloch and Sergeant have continued to tour and record as Echo & the Bunnymen, touring repeatedly and releasing the albums Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009) and Meteorites (2014). The Siberia band line up was Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant, Paul Fleming (keyboards), Simon Finley (drums) and Pete Wilkinson (bass), Hugh Jones produced Siberia after previously engineering early Bunnymen albums. Since August 2009 the group's touring incarnation has comprised McCulloch and Sergeant along with Stephen Brannan (bass), Gordy Goudie (guitar), Nicholas Kilroe (drums) and Jez Wing (keyboards). In 2002, the group received the Q Inspiration award. The award is for inspiring \\"new generations of musicians, songs and music lovers in general.\\" The band were said to be worthy winners as they have done much to promote the Mersey music scene. In a later interview for Magnet magazine, McCulloch said \\"It validates everything that we've tried to achieve‚Äîcool, great timeless music. It's not like an inspiration award affecting the past, it's affecting the current music.\\" On 11 September 2006, Echo & the Bunnymen released an updated version of their 1985 Songs to Learn and Sing compilation. Now re-titled More Songs to Learn and Sing, this new compilation was issued in two versions, a 17-track single CD and a 20-track version with a DVD featuring eight videos from their career. In March 2007, the Bunnymen announced that they had re-signed to their original record label, Warner, and were also working on a new album. The band were also said to be planning a live DVD, entitled \\"Dancing Horses\\", which also contained interviews with the band. This was released in May 2007, on Snapper/SPV. The live line up was Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant, Simon Finley (drums), Paul Fleming (keyboards), Gordy Goudie (guitar) and Steve Brannan (bass). On 11 January 2008, McCulloch was interviewed on BBC Breakfast at the start of Liverpool 08. He was asked about new Bunnymen material and he revealed that a new album would coincide with their gig at the Royal Albert Hall in September. He went on to say that the album was, \\"The best one we've made, apart from Ocean Rain.\\" In a 20 April 2008 interview with the Sunday Mail, Ian McCulloch announced The Fountain as the title of the new Echo & the Bunnymen album with producers John McLaughlin and Simon Perry, which was originally due to be released in 2008 but was finally released on 12 October 2009. The first single from the album, \\"Think I Need It Too\\", was released on 28 September 2009. On 1 September 2009, former keyboard player Jake Brockman died on the Isle of Man, when his motorbike collided with a converted ambulance. Brockman had played keyboards for the band during the 1980s. In December 2010, Echo & the Bunnymen went on tour playing their first two albums Crocodiles and Heaven Up Here in their entirety. Echo & the Bunnymen's most recent album of new material, entitled Meteorites, was released on 26 May 2014 in the UK, and on 3 June 2014 in the US via 429 Records. The album was also released on the pledgemusic.com website. The album was produced and mixed by Youth, who also co-wrote three of the tracks and played \\"additional bass\\" on it. It was the band's first UK Top 40 album entry since 1999. In 2018, Echo & the Bunnymen announced and released an album of reworked orchestral versions of older material and two new songs, entitled The Stars, The Oceans & The Moon, to mixed reception.

They signed to Saddle Creek Records and released a few singles, but were unable to establish widespread sales. After adding Matt Bowen, the Faint released Media. At the end of 1998, Jacob Thiele joined the band, and shortly thereafter, Matt Bowen was replaced by Ethan Jones. They toured the U.S., playing what would become the songs that would comprise the next album, Blank- Wave Arcade, which had a more dance and techno influenced sound and was an underground hit.Lazy-i // Interview , The Faint: men in black, (2001-08-15).

Partway through the creation of Danse Macabre, the Faint added Dapose, a death metal guitarist formerly of LEAD. Their next album, recorded with Mike Mogis and released in 2004, was called Wet from Birth. In May 2008, the Faint announced that they had split from Saddle Creek, and that their fifth studio album would be self-released under their own label, blank.wav. The album, entitled Fasciinatiion, was released on August 5, 2008 in the U.S. The first single from the album was \\"The Geeks Were Right\\", which was released on Boys Noize Records. It was also announced that the band would tour North America with British electronic group Ladytron during the spring. Since the release of Fasciinatiion, two of the band members, Clark Baechle and Todd Fink have been quietly, with little advertising, performing under the name Depressed Buttons, playing remixes of other artists, and DJing for various small clubs and venues. The band performed an original song \\"Teach Me Teacher\\" on the children's show Yo Gabba Gabba! in the third-season episode \\"School\\", which originally aired September 19, 2010. On October 30, 2012, Saddle Creek Records released a deluxe edition of Danse Macabre with the original album remastered, bonus and unreleased tracks, and a DVD of archival footage, live projections from that era's tour dates, and live footage. The band announced that it would play Danse Macabre in its entirety along with fan favorites during a tour of 24 cities across North America. In 2016, Graham Ulicny (of Reptar) replaced Jacob Thiele on keyboards. Thiele died on February 13, 2020.

Vitalism is the belief that \\"living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things\\". Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the \\"vital spark\\", \\"energy\\" or \\"√©lan vital\\", which some equate with the soul. In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was discussed among biologists, between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed testable hypotheses meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by empirical evidence, and hence regard it either as a superseded scientific theory, or, since the mid-20th century, as a pseudoscience. Vitalism has a long history in medical philosophies: many traditional healing practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.  History =Ancient times= The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient Egypt.Jidenu, Paulin (1996) African Philosophy, 2nd Ed. Indiana University Press, , p.16. In Greek philosophy, the Milesian school proposed natural explanations deduced from materialism and mechanism. However, by the time of Lucretius, this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable clinamen of Epicurus), and in Stoic physics, the pneuma assumed the role of logos. Galen believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body. =Medieval= In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of pneuma, helping to shape later aether theories. =Early modern= Vitalists included English anatomist Francis Glisson (1597‚Äì1677) and the Italian doctor Marcello Malpighi (1628‚Äì1694). Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1733‚Äì1794) is considered to be the father of epigenesis in embryology, that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his Theoria Generationis (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a vis essentialis (an organizing, formative force), stating \\"All believers in epigenesis are vitalists.\\" Carl Reichenbach (1788‚Äì1869) later developed the theory of Odic force, a form of life-energy that permeates living things. In the 17th century, modern science responded to Newton's action at a distance and the mechanism of Cartesian dualism with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called \\"organic\\" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking). As worded by Charles Birch and John B. Cobb, \\"the claims of the vitalists came to the fore again\\" in the 18th century: \\" Stahl's followers were active as were others, such as the physician genius Francis Xavier Bichat of the Hotel Dieu.\\" However, \\"Bichat moved from the tendency typical of the French vitalistic tradition to progressively free himself from metaphysics in order to combine with hypotheses and theories which accorded to the scientific criteria of physics and chemistry.\\" John Hunter recognised \\"a 'living principle' in addition to mechanics.\\" Johann Friedrich Blumenbach also was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of √úber den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgesch√§fte. Blumenbach cut up freshwater Hydra and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a \\"formative drive\\" (Bildungstrieb) in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, =19th century= Louis Pasteur argued that only life could catalyse fermentation. Painting by Albert Edelfelt, 1885 J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, one of the early 19th century fathers of modern chemistry, argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.Ede, Andrew. (2007) The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900‚Äì1935: The Neglected Dimension, p. 23 Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but Friedrich W√∂hler synthesised urea from inorganic components in 1828.Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when W√∂hler made urea. This W√∂hler Myth, as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, \\"ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned W√∂hler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'\\".The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the W√∂hler MythSchummer, J. http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf, 2003In 1845, Adolph Kolbe succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, Marcellin Berthelot repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, W√∂hler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown. Between 1833 and 1844, Johannes Peter M√ºller wrote a book on physiology called Handbuch der Physiologie, which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed M√ºller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a soul makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account. http://vlp.mpiwg- berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf Louis Pasteur (1822‚Äì1895) after his famous rebuttal of spontaneous generation, performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur \\"fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena.\\" Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, Liebig, Traube and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a \\"vital action\\". =20th century= Hans Driesch (1867‚Äì1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience. Vitalism is a superseded scientific hypothesis, and the term is sometimes used as a pejorative epithet.\\"Other writers (eg, Peterfreund, 1971) simply use the term vitalism as a pejorative label.\\" in Galatzer-Levy, RM (1976) Psychic Energy, A Historical Perspective Ann Psychoanal 4:41‚Äì61 Ernst Mayr (1904‚Äì2005) wrote: Other vitalists included Johannes Reinke and Oscar Hertwig. Reinke used the word neovitalism to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced Carl Jung.Noll, Richard. \\"Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants)\\". https://www.academia.edu/6789277/Jungs_concept_of_die_Dominanten_the_Dominants_1997_ John Scott Haldane adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an idealist philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that teleology was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book Mechanism, life and personality in 1913.Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168‚Äì169 Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: \\"we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity\\", \\"every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience\\". The work of Haldane was an influence on organicism. Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained: By 1931, biologists had \\"almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief.\\" Emergentism  Contemporary science and engineering sometimes describe emergent processes, in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents. This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system. Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.see \\"Emergent Properties\\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, online at Stanford University for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche, C. (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? Semiotica 134: 653‚Äì693 According to Emmeche et al. (1997):  Mesmerism  Franz Mesmer proposed the vitalist force of magn√©tisme animal in animals with breath. A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was \\"animal magnetism\\", in the theories of Franz Mesmer (1734‚Äì1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer's magn√©tisme animal can be misleading for three reasons: * Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic magnetism and planetary magnetism. * Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals. * Mesmer chose the word \\"animal,\\" for its root meaning (from Latin animus=\\"breath\\") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals. Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King Louis XVI of France appointed two commissions to investigate mesmerism; one was led by Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the other, led by Benjamin Franklin, included Bailly and Lavoisier. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and trances. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been \\"mesmerized\\"; he hugged each in turn to receive the \\"vital fluid,\\" but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a \\"sensitive\\" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that \\"the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid.\\"  Medical philosophies  Vitalism has a long history in medical philosophies: many traditional healing practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by Hippocrates, these vital forces were associated with the four temperaments and humours; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of qi or prana. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the Yoruba concept of ase. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies include energy therapies, associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as therapeutic touch, Reiki, external qi, chakra healing and SHEN therapy.Rubik, Bioenergetic Medicines, American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, In these therapies, the \\"subtle energy\\" field of a patient is manipulated by a practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a \\"complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body....\\" The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: \\"...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body.\\" The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.  Criticism  The 17th century French playwright Moli√®re mocked vitalism in his 1673 play Le Malade imaginaire. Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. Moli√®re had famously parodied this fallacy in Le Malade imaginaire, where a quack \\"answers\\" the question of \\"Why does opium cause sleep?\\" with \\"Because of its dormitive virtue (i.e., soporific power).\\" Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire. Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource) Thomas Henry Huxley compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its \\"aquosity\\".The Physical Basis of Life, Pall Mall Gazette, 1869 His grandson Julian Huxley in 1926 compared \\"vital force\\" or √©lan vital to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its √©lan locomotif (\\"locomotive force\\"). Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for organic chemistry and developmental biology, but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, Jacques Loeb published The Mechanistic Conception of Life, in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as Bertrand Russell put it (Religion and Science). He offered this challenge: : \\"... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible.\\" (pp. 5‚Äì6) Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly: : \\"It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical \\"life principle\\" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this \\"principle\\" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well- known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the \\"aquosity\\" be also taken into consideration.\\" (pp. 14‚Äì15) Bechtel states that vitalism \\"is often viewed as unfalsifiable, and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine.\\" For many scientists, \\"vitalist\\" theories were unsatisfactory \\"holding positions\\" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, Francis Crick, the co- discoverer of the structure of DNA, stated \\"And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only cranks will believe tomorrow.\\"Crick, Francis (1967) Of Molecules and Men; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed here. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism. Synthese 20:238‚Äì253, who describes Crick's remark as \\"raising spectral red herrings\\". While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the pseudoscientific retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. Alan Sokal published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of \\"scientific theories\\" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow- Travelers?).Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers? Use of a technique called therapeutic touch was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, \\"nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism\\" and added that \\"Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time.\\" Joseph C. Keating, Jr.Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch discusses vitalism's past and present roles in chiropractic and calls vitalism \\"a form of bio-theology.\\" He further explains that: : \\"Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'.\\" Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking: : \\"Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self- repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected.\\" Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint: : \\"Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist B.F. Skinner, for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'.\\" According to Williams, \\"[t]oday, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force.\\" \\"Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality.\\" Victor StengerVictor J. Stenger's site states that the term \\"bioenergetics\\" \\"is applied in biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable exchanges of energy within organisms, and between organisms and the environment, which occur by normal physical and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the bioenergetic field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry.\\" Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics. Joanne Stefanatos states that \\"The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics.\\"Stefanatos, J. 1997, Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine, Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices, Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago. Stenger offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called \\"human energy fields\\".Biley, Francis C. 2005, Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings, University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field. Vitalistic thinking has also been identified in the naive biological theories of children: \\"Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought.\\"  See also  * Energy (esotericism) * Etheric body * Georges Canguilhem * Henri Bergson * Holism in science * Homeopathy * Irreducible complexity * Lebensphilosophie * Mind‚Äìbody dualism * Morphic resonance * Odic force * Orenda * Orgone * Orthogenesis * Ratiovitalism * Vis medicatrix naturae * Vital materialism * Vitality NotesReferencesSources External links Vitalism at the Skeptic's Dictionary * For vital force and vitalism in the Spanish context, see Nicol√°s Fern√°ndez- Medina's Life Embodied: The Promise of Vital Force in Spanish Modernity (McGill-Queen's UP, 2018).

She lived in Gallowgate for a while before moving to Garfield Street, Dennistoun.She lived at 29 Garfield Street, according to an interview with the Sunday Post newspaper published on 5 April 2015. The interview may be seen here Retrieved 29 June 2015 At the age of 12 or 13, she and her manager approached a band called the Bellrocks seeking stage experience as a singer. She appeared with them every Saturday night: Alex Thomson, the group's bass player, has reported that even then her voice was remarkable. She has two brothers and a sister, and her father was a heavy drinker. Aged 14, she received the stage name \\"Lulu\\" from her future manager Marion Massey, who commented: \\"Well, all I know is that she's a real lulu of a kid.\\" In August 2017, Lulu's family history was the subject of an episode in the UK series Who Do You Think You Are? The research showed that her mother had been brought up by another family. The investigation into her genealogy showed that Lulu's maternal grandparents had come from across the religious divide in Glasgow. Her grandfather Hugh Cairns was a Catholic and her grandmother, Helen Kennedy, was a Protestant. Cairns had been a member of a Catholic gang and was found in the research to have been in and out of prison at the time of the birth of Lulu's mother. Kennedy was found to be the daughter of a Worthy Mistress of the Ladies' Orange Lodge 52; the discovery explained why the two families had opposed the union between Kennedy and Cairns. =Early chart hits= Lulu in 1965 on the set of Fanclub, Dutch TV In 1964, under the wing of Marion Massey, she was signed to Decca Records. When she was only fifteen, her version of the Isley Brothers' \\"Shout\\", credited to 'Lulu & the Luvvers' and delivered in a raucous but mature voice, peaked at no. 7 on the UK charts. Massey guided her career for more than 25 years, for most of which time they were partners in business, and Massey's husband Mark produced some of Lulu's recordings. After the success of \\"Shout\\", Lulu's next charting single was \\"Leave a Little Love\\" in 1965, which returned her to the UK Top Ten.

All her Decca recordings were made available in 2009 on a 2-CD set entitled Shout!, issued on RPM Records. After two hit singles with the Luvvers, Lulu embarked on a solo career.

All seven singles she cut with Mickie Most made the UK Singles Chart, ending with \\"Boom Bang-A-Bang\\" reaching number 2 in 1969.

Lulu both acted in the film and sang the title song, with which she had a major hit in the United States, reaching no. 1. \\"To Sir with Love\\" became the best-selling single of 1967 in the United States, selling well in excess of 1,000,000 copies; it was awarded a gold disc, and was ranked by Billboard magazine as the no. 1 song of the year.

One episode, from January 1969, is remembered for an unruly live appearance from the Jimi Hendrix Experience. During this appearance, after playing about two minutes of \\"Hey Joe\\", Hendrix stopped and announced, \\"We'd like to stop playing this rubbish and dedicate a song to Cream, regardless of what kind of group they may be in, dedicate to Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce.\\" Hendrix and his band then broke into \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". The studio director signalled for Hendrix to stop, but he continued. Hendrix was told he would never work at the BBC again, but was unrepentant. He told his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, \\"I'm not going to sing with Lulu. I'd look ridiculous.\\" Concurrently with her TV series, Lulu also hosted several 'one-off' specials. These included Lulu At Bern's Restaurant in 1969; a show recorded in Sweden with the Young Generation; 1970's The Young Generation Meet Lulu (also recorded in Sweden) and Bruce Forsyth Meets Lulu in 1975. =Eurovision Song Contest= On 29 March 1969, she represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest performing the song \\"Boom Bang-a-Bang\\", written by Peter Warne and Alan Moorhouse, the song chosen from a selection of six by viewers of her BBC1 variety series Happening for Lulu and on a special show hosted by Michael Aspel in which she performed all six one after another. One song, \\"I Can't Go On...\\", written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, came last in the postcard vote but was later recorded by Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw, Polly Brown and Elton John himself as well as by Lulu. In Madrid, Lulu was accompanied by Sue and Sunny while the orchestra was conducted by Lulu's musical director Johnny Harris. Lulu later recalled: \\"Boom Bang-a-Bang\\" won, though three other songs, from Spain, (\\"Vivo cantando\\" by Salom√©), the Netherlands, (\\"De troubadour\\" by Lenny Kuhr) and France, (\\"Un jour, un enfant\\" by Frida Boccara) tied with her on 18 votes each. The rules were subsequently altered to prevent such ties in future years, but the result caused Austria, Portugal, Norway, Sweden and Finland not to enter the 1970 contest.O'Connor, John Kennedy (2007). The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. London: Carlton. . Lulu's song came out the best in sales, with German, French, Spanish and Italian versions alongside the original English. Later she told John Peel; \\"I know it's a rotten song, but I won, so who cares? I'd have sung \\"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\\" standing on my head if that's what it took to win.... I am just so glad I didn't finish second like all the other Brits before me, that would have been awful.\\" Despite her dislike it is her second biggest UK hit to date, reaching No.2 on the chart in 1969.

Maurice's older brother Barry was opposed to their marriage as he believed them to be too young. Their honeymoon in Mexico had to be postponed because of Lulu's Eurovision commitment. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced in 1973, but remained on good terms. =Late 1960s and Muscle Shoals recordings= From 30 June to 2 July 1967, Lulu appeared with the Monkees at the Empire Pool, Wembley, and her brief romance with Davy Jones of the Monkees during a concert tour of the United States in March 1968 received much publicity in the UK press.

From 1905 Carson was both the Irish Unionist Alliance MP for Trinity College Dublin and leader of the Ulster Unionist Council in Belfast. In 1915 he entered the war cabinet of Herbert Asquith as Attorney-General. Carson was defeated in his ambition to maintain Ireland as a whole in union with Great Britain. His leadership, however, was celebrated for securing a continued place in the United Kingdom for the six north-east counties, albeit under a devolved Northern Ireland Parliament that neither he nor his fellow unionists had sought. He is also remembered for his open ended cross examination of Oscar Wilde in a legal action that Wilde had brought, but led to him being gaoled and ruined. Carson unsuccessfully attempted to intercede for Wilde after the case.John Brown, \\"Carson, Sir Edward, Baron Carson 1854‚Äì1935\\" in David Loades, ed., Reader's Guide to British History (2003) 1:227  Early life  4 Harcourt Street, Dublin, where Carson was born in 1854 Edward Carson, the 2nd son of Edward Henry Carson, architect, was born at 4 Harcourt Street, in Dublin, into a wealthy Anglican family.Marjoribanks, Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson, London, 1932, p. 5 The Carsons were of Scottish origin, Edward's grandfather having originally moved to Dublin from Dumfries in 1815. Carson's mother was Isabella Lambert, the daughter of Captain Peter Lambert, part of an old Anglo-Irish family, the Lamberts of Castle Ellen, County Galway. Carson spent holidays at Castle Ellen, which was owned by his uncle.Marjoribanks, Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson, London, 1932, p. 6 He was one of six children (four boys and two girls).

As a barrister  Carson's ceremonial dress uniform, worn on his appointment as Solicitor General for England in 1900. In 1877 Carson was called to the Irish Bar at King's Inns. He gained a reputation for fearsome advocacy and supreme legal ability and became regarded as a brilliant barrister, among the most prominent in Ireland at the time.::History Learning Site:: He was also an acknowledged master of the appeal to the jury by his legal wit and oratory. He was appointed Queen's Counsel (Ireland) in 1889 and was Called to the English Bar at Middle Temple on 26 April 1893. He was twice admitted to the Inn, once on 1 November 1875 and then again on 21 April 1893, and was made a Bencher on 15 June 1900.Sturgess, H.A.C. (1949).

In 1895, he was engaged by the Marquess of Queensberry to lead his defence against Oscar Wilde's action for criminal libel. The Marquess, angry at Wilde's ongoing homosexual relationship with his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, had left his calling card at Wilde's club with an inscription accusing Wilde of being a \\"posing somdomite\\" . Wilde retaliated with a libel action, as homosexuality was, at the time, illegal. Kevin Myers states that Carson's initial response was to refuse to take the case. Later, he discovered that Queensberry had been telling the truth about Wilde's activity and was therefore not guilty of the libel of which Wilde accused him. Carson and Wilde met as children playing in the summer along the seashore at Dungarvan, County Waterford, and they knew each other when they were students at Trinity College, Dublin. When he heard that Carson was to lead the defence, Wilde is quoted as saying that \\"No doubt he will pursue his case with all the added bitterness of an old friend.\\"Oscar Wilde by Richard Ellmann, published in 1987https://www.google.com/books/edition/Oscar_Wilde/FVNwAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=%27Oscar+Wilde%27%27+by+%5B%5BRichard+Ellmann%5D%5D&printsec;=frontcover Carson portrayed the playwright as a morally depraved hedonist who seduced na√Øve young men into a life of homosexuality with lavish gifts and promises of a glamorous artistic lifestyle. He impugned Wilde's works as morally repugnant and designed to corrupt the upbringing of the youth. Queensberry spent a large amount of money on private detectives who investigated Wilde's activity in the London underworld of homosexual clubs and procurers. Wilde abandoned the case when Carson announced in his opening speech for the defence that he planned to call several male prostitutes who would testify that they had had sex with Wilde, which would have rendered the libel charge unsupportable as the accusation would have been proven true. Wilde was bankrupted when he was then ordered to pay the considerable legal and detective bills Queensberry had incurred in his defence. Based on the evidence of Queensberry's detectives and Carson's cross-examinations of Wilde at the trial, Wilde was subsequently prosecuted for gross indecency in a second trial. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to two years' hard labour, after which he moved to France, where he died penniless. = Cadbury Bros. = In 1908 Carson appeared for the London Evening Standard in a libel action brought by George Cadbury. The Standard was controlled by Unionist interests which supported Joseph Chamberlain's Imperial Preference views. The Cadbury family were Liberal supporters of free trade and had, in 1901, purchased The Daily News. The Standard articles alleged that Cadbury Bros Ltd., which claimed to be model employers having created the village of Bournville outside Birmingham, knew of the slave labour conditions on S√£o Tom√©, the Portuguese island colony from which Cadbury purchased most of the cocoa used in the production of their chocolate. The articles alleged that George's son William had gone to S√£o Tom√© in 1901 and observed for himself the slave conditions, and that the Cadbury family had decided to continue purchasing the cocoa grown there because it was cheaper than that grown in the British colony of the Gold Coast, where labour conditions were much better, being regulated by the Colonial Office. The Standard alleged that the Cadbury family knew that the reason cocoa from S√£o Tom√© was cheaper was because it was grown by slave labour. This case was regarded at the time as an important political case as Carson and the Unionists maintained that it showed the fundamental immorality of free trade. George Cadbury recovered contemptuous damages of one farthing in a case described as one of Carson's triumphs.Chocolate on Trial: Slavery, Politics, and the Ethics of Business, by Lowell J. Satre = Archer-Shee case = Carson was also the victorious counsel in the 1910 Archer-Shee Case, exonerating a Royal Naval College, Osborne cadet of the charge of theft. The cadet was from a quite prominent Roman Catholic banking family, and educated at Stonyhurst. On this case, Terence Rattigan based his play The Winslow Boy. The fictional barrister, Morton, is a somewhat different character from Carson. There is, however, one interesting detail. At the end of the play Morton indicates he may take a continued interest in the boy‚Äôs sister, who had played a key role in the fictional case. In his account of the case, which was the last chapter of his book before his suicide, Edward Marjoribanks said that Carson‚Äôs first marriage was strained and his wife died around this time. He then married a much younger woman, Lucy Frewen, and Marjoribanks, who had help from the Carson family, says her interest in him was aroused by the Archer- Shee case. They had a son (also Edward) born when Carson was over 60, who in 1945 became the youngest Member of Parliament but resigned after eight years for health reasons.  Politics  Carson's political career began on 20 June 1892, when he was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland, although he was not then a member of the House of Commons. He was elected as Member of Parliament for the University of Dublin in the 1892 general election as a Liberal Unionist, although as a whole the party lost the election to the Liberals. Carson maintained his career as a barrister and was admitted to the English Bar by The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple in 1893 and from then on mainly practised in London. In 1896 he was sworn of the Irish Privy Council. He was appointed Solicitor-General for England on 7 May 1900, receiving the customary knighthood. He served in this position until the Conservative government resigned in December 1905, when he was rewarded with membership of the Privy Council. In the 1918 general election, Sinn F√©in won 73 out of the 105 Irish seats in the House of Commons. In 25 constituencies, Sinn F√©in won the seats unopposed. Unionists (including Ulster Unionist Labour Association) won 26 seats, all but three of which were in the six counties that today form Northern Ireland, and the Irish Parliamentary Party won only six (down from 84), all but one in Ulster. The Labour Party did not stand in the election, allowing the electorate to decide between home rule or a republic by having a clear choice between the two nationalist parties. Irish Republicans regarded these elections as the mandate to establish the First D√°il. As such, all persons in Ireland elected to Westminster were considered to have been elected to D√°il √âireann. Had he chosen to do so, Carson could have exercised the option of attending the meeting of the First D√°il in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. Like all of those elected to Irish seats in December 1918 he received an invitation, written as gaeilge, to attend. He kept the invitation as a souvenir. When his name was called out in the first roll call of the new D√°il, it was met by silence, and then laughter, from the Sinn F√©in delegates and the audience in the Mansion House. He was listed as ‚Äúas l√°thair‚Äù, or absent.  Unionism  In September 1911 a huge crowd of over 50,000 people gathered to rally near Belfast to hear Carson speaking to urge his party take on the governance of Ulster. With the passage of the Parliament Act 1911, the Unionists faced the loss of the House of Lords' ability to thwart the passage of the new Home Rule Bill. Carson disliked many of Ulster's local characteristics and, in particular, the culture of Orangeism (although he had become an Orangeman at nineteen he left the institution shortly afterwards).Marjoribanks, The Life of Lord Carson, Vol. 1, Camelot Press, 1932 p. 68 He stated that their speeches reminded him of \\"the unrolling of a mummy. All old bones and rotten rags.\\" Sir Edward Carson signing the Ulster Covenant. Carson campaigned against Home Rule. He spoke against the Bill in the House of Commons and organised rallies in Ireland promoting a provisional government for \\"the Protestant province of Ulster\\" to be ready, should a third Home Rule Bill come into law. On Sunday 28 September 1912, 'Ulster Day', he was the first signatory on the Ulster Covenant, which bound 447,197 signatoriesThe number eventually exceeded 470,000 in England and Scotland. to resist Home Rule with the threat that they would use \\"all means necessary\\" after Carson had established the Ulster Volunteers, the first loyalist paramilitary group. From it the Ulster Volunteer Force was formed in January 1913 to undergo military training and purchase arms.M McNally, Easter Rising 1916: Birth of the Irish Republic, Osprey, 2007, pp. 8-9. In Parliament Carson rejected any olive branch for compromise demanding Ulster \\"be given a resolution rather than a stay of execution\\".McNally, Easter Rising 1916, p.11. The UVF received a large arms cache from Germany on the night of 24 April 1914.known as Operation Lion. Stewart, The Ulster Crisis, p.88. Historian Felician Prill says Germany was not trying to start a civil war, for the Ulster cause was not popular in Berlin. Later that year, a further shipment of arms from Germany was delivered to the pro-Home Rule and IRB-influenced Irish Volunteers at Howth near Dublin.Asgard (yacht)#cite note-ring95-99-1 The Home Rule Bill was passed by the Commons on 25 May 1914 by a majority of 77 and due to the Parliament Act 1911, it did not need the Lords' consent, so the bill was awaiting royal assent. To enforce the legislation, given the activities of the Unionists, H. H. Asquith's Liberal government had prepared to send troops to Ulster. This sparked the Curragh Incident on 20 March. Together with the arming of the Irish Volunteers, Ireland was on the brink of civil war when the outbreak of the First World War led to the suspension of the Home Rule Act's operation until the end of the war.A. T. Q. Stewart, The Ulster Crisis, Resistance to Home Rule, 1912‚Äì14, p. 235 (Faber and Faber, London, 1967, 1979), By this time Carson had announced in Belfast that an Ulster Division would be formed from the U.V.F., and the 36th (Ulster) Division was swiftly organised. Brown examines why Carson's role in 1914 made him a highly controversial figure: In 1914, suffragettes Flora Drummond and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam) besieged Carson's home, arguing that his form of Ulster 'incitement to militancy' passed without notice whilst suffragettes were charged and imprisoned for same action. In a 1921 speech opposing the pending Anglo-Irish Treaty, Carson attacked the \\"Tory intrigues\\" that had led him on the course that would partition Ireland, an outcome he opposed almost as strongly as Home Rule itself. In the course of the speech Carson said: Later in the speech, Carson said:  Cabinet member  Edward Carson's statue at Stormont On 25 May 1915, Asquith appointed Carson Attorney-General when the Coalition Government was formed after the Liberal government was brought down by the Shell Crisis and the resignation of Admiral Fisher. He resigned on 19 October, however, citing his opposition to Government policy on war in the Balkans. During Asquith's coalition government of 1915‚Äì1916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by John Redmond. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. After Carson, the leading figure among the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915, he then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons. He played a major role in forcing the resignation of Asquith as Prime Minister, returning to office on 10 December 1916 as First Lord of the Admiralty, and elevated to the powerful British War Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio on 17 July 1917.War Memoirs of David Lloyd George, Vol. III, London: Ivor Nicholson & Watson, 1934, pgs. 1175-77 Carson was hostile to the foundation of the League of Nations as he believed that this institution would be ineffectual against war. In a speech on 7 December 1917 he said: > Talk to me of treaties! Talk to me of the League of Nations! Every Great > Power in Europe was pledged by treaty to preserve Belgium. That was a League > of Nations, but it failed.Henry R. Winkler, \\"The Development of the League > of Nations Idea in Great Britain, 1914‚Äì1919\\", The Journal of Modern History, > Vol. 20, No. 2. (June 1948), p. 105. Early in 1918, the government decided to extend conscription to Ireland, and that Ireland would have to be given home rule in order to make it acceptable. Carson disagreed in principle and again resigned on 21 January. He gave up his seat at the University of Dublin in the 1918 general election and was instead elected for Belfast Duncairn. He continued to lead the Unionists, but when the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was introduced, advised his party to work for the exemption of six Ulster counties from Home Rule as the best compromise (a compromise he had previously rejected). This proposal passed and as a result the Parliament of Northern Ireland was established.Frank Costello, \\"King George V's Speech at Stormont (1921): Prelude to the Anglo-Irish Truce\\", Eire- Ireland, (1987), pp. 43‚Äì57. In January 1921 he met in London over three days with Father O'Flanagan and Lord Justice Sir James O'Connor to try to find a mutual agreement that would end the Anglo-Irish war, but without result.\\"Memorandum by James O'Connor of an interview with Edward Carson\\"; RIA, Dublin, 1993. National Archives of Ireland file UCDA P150/1902 After the partition of Ireland, Carson repeatedly warned Ulster Unionist leaders not to alienate northern Catholics, as he foresaw this would make Northern Ireland unstable. In 1921 he stated: \\"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\\" In old age, while at London's Carlton Club, he confided to the Anglo-Irish (and Catholic) historian Sir Charles Petrie his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \\"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\\"Sir Charles Petrie, A Historian Looks At His World (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.  Judge  Stormont Carson was asked to lead the Unionists during the election to become the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. He declined due to his lack of connections with any Northern Ireland constituency (an opponent once taunted him saying: \\"He has no country, he has no caste\\"),Marjoribanks, Volume One: The Life of Lord Carson, London, 1932, p. 8 and resigned the leadership of the party in February 1921. Carson was appointed one of seven Lords of Appeal in Ordinary on 24 May 1921 and was created a life peer under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 on 1 June 1921 as Baron Carson, of Duncairn in the County of Antrim.  Private life  Sir Edward Carson mural in Belfast in 2006 Carson married twice. His first wife was Annette Kirwan from County Galway, daughter of Henry Persse Kirwan, a retired County Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary. They were married on 19 December 1879. He had two sons and two daughters by his first wife (he described them as a \\"rum lot\\"), namely: * The Hon. William Henry Lambert Carson, born 2 October 1880 (d. 1930) * The Hon. Aileen Seymour Carson, born 13 November 1881 * The Hon. Gladys Isobel Carson, born 1885 * The Hon. Walter Seymour Carson, born 1890 The first Lady Carson died in 1913. His second wife was Ruby Frewen (1881‚Äì1966), a Yorkshirewoman, the daughter of Lt.-Col. Stephen Frewen, later Frewen-Laton MP (1857‚Äì1933) and Emily Augusta (Peacocke) Frewen. They were married on 17 September 1914; she was 29 and he was 60. They had one son: * The Hon. Edward Carson MP, born 17 February 1920  Later years  St Anne's Cathedral; Carson's final resting place Carson retired in October 1929. In July 1932, he had witnessed the unveiling of a large statue (sculpted by L. S. Merrifield) of himself in front of Parliament Buildings at Stormont. The statue was unveiled by Lord Craigavon in the presence of more than 40,000 people. The statue was cast in bronze and placed upon a plinth. The inscription on the base read \\"By the loyalists of Ulster as an expression of their love and admiration for its subject\\". This was the last time he visited Ulster. = State funeral = Lord Carson lived at Cleve Court, a Queen Anne house near Minster in the Isle of Thanet, Kent, bought in 1921. It was here that Carson died peacefully on 22 October 1935. Britain gave him a state funeral, which took place in Belfast at St Anne's Cathedral; he is still the only person to have been buried there. From a silver bowl, soil from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland was scattered on to his coffin, which had earlier been covered by the Union Flag, which however was removed during the service. At his funeral service the choir sang his own favourite hymn, \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country\\". A warship had brought his body to Belfast and the funeral took place on Saturday 26 October 1935. Thousands of shipworkers stopped work and bowed their heads as HMS Broke steamed slowly up Belfast Lough, with Carson's flag-draped coffin sat on the quarterdeck. =Memories= Carson Poster, Belfast, August 2007 Even before his death, there was an organized effort to portray Carson as the heroic embodiment of the militant unionist spirit. In November 1932 the new Stormont Parliament became the greatest Carson monument, giving his admirers the symbolic endorsement of their state. His statue was unveiled as the speakers excited the audience with triumphalist images of Protestant deliverance from Catholic tyranny. Carson's funeral in 1935 was attended with pomp and unionist symbolism, as happened again with the dedication of a plaque in his memory in 1938. Calling for unity with Britain, numerous ceremonial rituals, memorials, and anniversaries affirmed the legitimacy of the state, and the Protestant ascendancy. The media enthusiastically participated, paying much less attention to such mundane issues as massive unemployment, poor housing, and rising religious tensions.Gillian McIntosh, \\"Symbolic mirrors: commemorations of Edward Carson in the 1930s.\\" Irish Historical Studies 32.125 (2000): 93‚Äì112. James Craig, celebrated as the hero of the 1912‚Äì1914 counterrevolution, often joined Carson in Protestant Ireland's memory.Alvin Jackson, \\"Unionist Myths 1912‚Äì1985.\\" Past & Present 136 (1992): 164‚Äì185.

He was created a baronet in 1918 and raised to the Peerage in 1927. Early life Craig was born at Sydenham, Belfast, the son of James Craig (1828‚Äì1900), a wealthy whiskey distiller who had entered the firm of Dunville & Co as a clerk: by age 40 he was a millionaire and a partner in the firm. James Craig Snr. owned a large house called Craigavon, overlooking Belfast Lough. His mother, Eleanor Gilmore Browne, was the daughter of Robert Browne, a prosperous man who owned property in Belfast and a farm outside Lisburn. Craig was the seventh child and sixth son in the family; there were eight sons and one daughter in all. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, Scotland; his father had taken a conscious decision not to send his sons to any of the more fashionable public schools. After school he began work as a stockbroker, eventually opening his own firm in Belfast. Military career Craig enlisted in the 3rd (Militia) battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles on 17 January 1900 to serve in the Second Boer War. He was seconded to the Imperial Yeomanry, a cavalry force created for service during the war, as a lieutenant in the 13th battalion on 24 February 1900, and left Liverpool for South Africa on the SS Cymric in March 1900. After arrival he was soon sent to the front, and was taken prisoner in May 1900, but released by the Boers because of a perforated eardrum. On his recovery he became deputy assistant director of the Imperial Military Railways, showing the qualities of organisation that were to mark his involvement in both British and Ulster politics. In June 1901 he was sent home suffering from dysentery, and by the time he was fit for service again the war was over. He was promoted to captain in the 3rd Royal Irish Rifles on 20 September 1902, while still seconded to South Africa. Military life suited him well, but he became impatient with what he saw as the lack of professionalism and efficiency in the British Army. Politics Vanity Fair, 1911 On his return to Ireland, having received a ¬£100,000 legacy from his father's will, he turned to politics, serving as Member of the British Parliament for East Down from 1906‚Äì18. From 1918-21 he represented Mid Down, and served in the British government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions (1919‚Äì20) and Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (1920‚Äì21). Craig rallied Ulster loyalist opposition to Irish Home Rule in Ulster before the First World War, organising the paramilitary Ulster Volunteers (UVF) and buying arms from Imperial Germany. The UVF became the nucleus of the 36th (Ulster) Division during the First World War. He succeeded Edward Carson as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party in February 1921. In the 1921 Northern Ireland general election, the first ever, he was elected to the newly created Northern Ireland House of Commons as one of the members for County Down. Craig (third from left) with his first cabinet, in 1921 On 7 June 1921, Craig was appointed the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The House of Commons of Northern Ireland assembled for the first time later that day. A dedicated member of the Orange Order and staunchly Protestant,CAIN website, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 4 September 2017. he famously stated, in April 1934, in response to George Leeke's question regarding Craig's Protestant Parliament: > The hon.

Time cover, 26 May 1924 This speech is often misquoted, intentionally or otherwise, as: \\"A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People\\", and conflated with an incident which occurred respective to the naming of the New City of Craigavon. Knockmena (a corruption of the townland name, Knockmenagh) was the preferred name nationalists hoped would be used, and which might have attracted broad acceptance on both sides. On 6 July 1965, it was announced that the new city would be named Craigavon after Craig. A noted nationalist, Joseph Connellan, interrupted the announcement with the comment, \\"A Protestant city for a Protestant people\\".Mulholland, Marc. \\"Why Did Unionists Discriminate?, academia.edu; accessed 4 September 2017. Later that year, speaking in the House of Commons at Stormont on 21 November 1934 in response to an accusation that all government appointments in Northern Ireland were carried out on a religious basis, he replied: \\"... it is undoubtedly our duty and our privilege, and always will be, to see that those appointed by us possess the most unimpeachable loyalty to the King and Constitution. That is my whole object in carrying on a Protestant Government for a Protestant people. I repeat it in this House\\".Northern Ireland Parliamentary Debates; Vol. 17, columns 73 & 74; accessed 4 September 2017. He was made a baronet in 1918, and in 1927 was created Viscount Craigavon, of Stormont in the County of Down. He was also the recipient of honorary degrees from The Queen's University of Belfast (1922) and Oxford University (1926). Lord Craigavon's tomb, Stormont Parliament grounds Close-up of the tomb carving Craig had made his career in British as well as Northern Irish politics; but his premiership showed little sign of his earlier close acquaintance with the British political world. He became intensely parochial, and suffered from his loss of intimacy with British politicians in 1938, when the British government concluded agreements with Dublin to end the Anglo-Irish economic war between the two countries. He never tried to persuade Westminster to protect Northern Ireland's industries, especially the linen industry, which was central to its economy. He was anxious not to provoke Westminster, given the precarious state of Northern Ireland's position. In April 1939, and again in May 1940 in the Second World War, he called for conscription to be introduced in Northern Ireland (which the British government, fearing a backlash from nationalists, refused). He also called for Churchill to invade √âire, the south of Ireland, using Scottish and Welsh troops in order to seize the valuable ports and install a Governor-General at Dublin. Lady Londonderry confided to Sir Samuel Hoare, the Home Secretary until the outbreak of the war, that Craigavon had become \\"ga-ga\\" but Craigavon was still prime minister when he died peacefully at his home at Glencraig, County Down at the age of 69. He was buried on the Stormont Estate, and was succeeded as the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland by the Minister of Finance, John Miller Andrews. Personal life His wife, Cecil Mary Nowell Dering Tupper (Viscountess Craigavon), whom he married on 22 March 1905 after a very brief courtship, was English, the daughter of Sir Daniel Tupper, assistant comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's department of the king's household. They had twin sons and a daughter. A president of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council, she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1941.

As a theme it brings intense emotions into the foreground, and has consequences for all concerned. It also automatically brings its own conflict, between the people concerned and between sexual desires and a sense of loyalty. As marriage and family are often regarded as basis of society, a story of adultery often shows the conflict between social pressure and individual struggle for happiness. According to the American author Tom Perrotta, the novel of adultery is one of the leading 19th century literary tradition in Europe and in the United States. He states that these novels often feature women whose unhappy marriages push them into seeking romance and illicit sex. The main topic of these novels is the rebel-woman who seeks salvation for her unhappy public love-life. In the Bible, incidents of adultery are present almost from the start. The story of Abraham contains several incidents and serve as warnings or stories of sin and forgiveness. Abraham attempts to continue his blood line through his wife's maidservant, with consequences that continue through history. Jacob's family life is complicated with similar incidents.

His work is often described as \\"realist\\",Maurice Pialat: A Cinema of Surrender at Rouge though many film criticsTribute to Maurice Pialat at Senses of Cinema acknowledge it does not fit the traditional definition of realism. Life and career Pialat was born in Cunlhat, Puy-de-D√¥me, France. He originally intended to become a painter, but met with little success.Lightning in a Bottle at Film Comment Having acquired a camera at age 16, he tried his hand at documentary films before making his first notable short, L'amour existe, in 1960. Pialat came to filmmaking late. He directed his feature-length debut, 1969's L'enfance nue (The Naked Childhood) at age 44. The film, which was co-produced by French New Wave director Fran√ßois Truffaut, won the Prix Jean Vigo. During his 35-year career, Pialat completed ten major features, many of which‚Äîmost notably Loulou‚Äîhave been interpreted as autobiographical.\\"Maurice Pialat: the man who changed French cinema\\", Sight & Sound, 18 October 2019. Retrieved on 18 October 2019. He directed G√©rard Depardieu in four films: Loulou, Police, Sous le soleil de Satan (Under the Sun of Satan), for which Pialat won the Palme d'Or at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, and Le Gar√ßu (1995). In a posthumous tribute written for the French film magazine Positif, critic No√´l Herpe called Pialat's style \\"a naturalism that was born of formalism\\". In English-language film criticism, he is often compared to his American contemporary John Cassavetes.Maurice Pialat at John Cassavetes at Senses of Cinema Summarizing Pialat's stance as a filmmaker in a profile for Film Comment, critic Kent Jones wrote: \\"To say that Pialat marched to the beat of a different drummer is to put it mildly. In fact, he didn't really march at all. He ambled, and fuck anybody who got it into their head that they'd like to amble along with him. Or behind him. Or ahead of him.\\" Style Pialat's films are often noted for their loose yet rigorous style and for their somewhat elliptical editing, which emphasizes an unsentimental worldview. Describing the unique aesthetics of Pialat's work, film critic Kent Jones wrote: \\"Even more than Jean Eustache [...] Pialat was an irascibly private artist, charting a twisted, crook-backed path with each new movie, almost always emerging with works in which the mind-bending vitality of immediate experience trumps all belief systems, allegiances, plans. [...] More than Cassavetes, more than Renoir, Pialat wanted every frame of celluloid bearing his name to be marked by the here and the now. [...] He was always willing to bend his narratives around experience. And the frequent ruptures, discontinuities, perspective shifts, and ellipses in his work are less single- minded than those of Cassavetes, more far-reaching in their implications.\\" Pialat's work is marked by the use of long takes, often with sudden peaks of dramatic intensity in character interaction. He also played supporting roles in some of his films.

He won the Turner Prize in 2007 for his work State Britain. He is a studio holder at The Bomb Factory Art Foundation in Archway, North London.  Early life and education  Mark Wallinger was born in Chigwell, Essex. His formative schooling, from the age of 11, was undertaken at West Hatch High School, Chigwell, Essex. He first studied art at the Chelsea School of Art and later at Goldsmiths College where he was also a tutor from 1986.  Career  Wallinger exhibited throughout the 1980s and held one of his very first solo exhibitions from 6 August to 4 September 1983 at The Minories, Colchester. Later he showed work in the Young British Artists II show at Charles Saatchi's gallery in 1993 and at the Royal Academy's Sensation exhibition in 1997. In 2000, a retrospective of his work, Credo, was exhibited at Tate Liverpool. = Early work = Wallinger's early work is noted for its social commentary, often focusing on class, royalty and nationalism. These works are often paintings, although by the 1990s he was beginning to use a wider range of techniques, which have continued to feature in his work since. In 1991, Wallinger exhibited a series of full-length portrait paintings of the homeless called \\"Capital\\" at the ICA in London that were bought by Charles Saatchi and later exhibited at his gallery along with Wallinger's life size paintings of racehorses. Up until 1995, sport as a nexus for English national obsessions was a frequent topic of his work. In 1994 Wallinger appropriated an entire international football match at Wembley Stadium by being photographed with a large Union Jack banner with his name emblazoned on it. As a state flag the Union Flag has superiority to the Cross of St. George that most England football team fans display. His 1995 Turner Prize nomination was largely thanks to his work of the previous year, A Real Work Of Art. This was actually a racehorse, which the racing fan Wallinger had bought and named \\"A Real Work Of Art\\" with a view to entering it in races and therefore causing this \\"art\\" to be piped into bookmakers up and down the country. It would thus be a further development of Marcel Duchamp's readymades. As things turned out, however, the horse was injured, and only ran one race. = Later work = Wallinger's later work appears to have largely turned away from his earlier preoccupations, instead apparently focusing on religion and death and the influence of William Blake. \\"Angel\\" is a video played in reverse showing the artist walking backwards at the bottom of the down escalator at Angel Underground Station while reciting the opening lines of the Gospel of John in the King James Bible. At the conclusion of the video the music of Zadok the Priest that forms part of the British Coronation ceremony can be heard as Wallinger 'ascends' up the stairs. No Man's Land, a show at the Whitechapel Gallery included several works on these subjects. Threshold to the Kingdom (2000), for example, is a slow motion video of people coming through automatic double doors at international arrivals at an airport. The video is accompanied by a recording of the famous Miserere by Gregorio Allegri. Wallinger has said that the title might be taken as a double meaning: arrival at the United Kingdom, but also at the kingdom of heaven, with a security guard playing the part of St. Peter. As well as traditional religion, Wallinger's work has sometimes referenced myths. Ghost (2001) is a negative print of George Stubbs' famous horse painting Whistlejacket that has had a horn added to its head, thus turning it into a unicorn. Originally planned as a full-scale painting, time constraints meant the piece was manipulated entirely in Photoshop from high quality side scans. Time and Relative Dimensions in Space (2001) takes a more modern myth as its subject - it is a life-sized mirrored model of the TARDIS from Doctor Who which at certain angles seems to blend into its environment. The largest work in the No Man's Land show was Prometheus. This piece is in two parts - on the outside, in a dark corridor, is a video of Wallinger (or rather his alter-ego, \\"Blind Faith\\") sitting in an electric chair and singing Ariel's song from William Shakespeare's The Tempest. From the corridor, automatic double doors give access to a brightly lit room which has an electric chair bolted to one of the walls, giving a top-down \\"God's-eye view\\" of it. On two facing walls are large photos of fists with the words \\"LOVE\\" and \\"HATE\\" written on them, a reference to the preacher played by Robert Mitchum in the film, The Night of the Hunter, who had similar tattoos on his knuckles. A circular steel loop gives out a continuous buzzing sound. Ecce Homo was the first work to occupy the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square. This work is a life-sized statue of a Christ figure, naked apart from a loin cloth, and with his hands bound behind his back. He wears a crown of barbed wire. The sculpture was placed at the very front edge of the massive plinth, emphasising its vulnerability and relative smallness. It was quite popular with the public and was later shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, where Wallinger was Britain's representative. State Britain was installed inside the Duveen Hall of Tate Britain in January 2007. It is a meticulous recreation of a 40 metre long display which had originally been situated around peace campaigner Brian Haw's protest outside the Houses of Parliament against policies towards Iraq. The original display consisted of donations from the public, including paintings, banners and toys. This had been confiscated by the police under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. He also put a black line on the floor of the Tate and through the middle of his exhibit to mark part of a 1 kilometre exclusion zone from Parliament Square. In 2011 the artwork was exhibited for the first time in the Netherlands at the De Pont museum. He was one of the five artists shortlisted for the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project in January 2008, and in February 2009 it was announced that his design had won the competition. Wallinger's design is of a giant white horse modelled on another of his own racehorses, 'Riviera Red', and has been described by his supporters as \\"an absolutely mesmerising conflation of old England and new, of the semi-mythical, Tolkienesque past and the six-lanes, all-crawling present\\". He curated the exhibition \\"The Russian Linesman: Frontiers, Borders and Thresholds\\" at the Hayward Gallery in London, which lasted from February to May 2009. Labyrinth 218, Cockfosters. In April 2011, it was announced that Mark Wallinger would be one of three artists (along with Chris Ofili and Conrad Shawcross) to collaborate with the Royal Ballet and the National Gallery to create a piece based on works by the Renaissance painter Titian. Titian Metamorphosis, which documented the entire project from conception to finished performances, was published by London- based publisher Art / Books in two editions in January 2013. In February 2013, it was announced that Wallinger had created Labyrintha set of 270 enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every London tube station, to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground; each will be numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 Guinness World Record Tube Challenge. In October 2014, Art / Books published Labyrinth: A Journey Through London's Underground by Mark Wallinger, a comprehensive photographic book of all 270 labyrinth designs in situ in the Underground stations. In 2019 Wallinger displayed his sculpture entitled The World Turned Upside Down at the London School of Economics. The artwork attracted controversy for showing the island of Taiwan as a sovereign entity, rather than as part of the People‚Äôs Republic of China.Martin Bailey (5 April 2019), Wallinger's upside-down globe outside LSE angers Chinese students for portraying Taiwan as an independent state The Art Newspaper. After dueling protests by students from both the PRC and ROC and reactions by third party observers (which included the President of Taiwan, Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the co-chairs of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group in the House of Commons) the university decided later that year that it would retain the original design which chromatically displayed the PRC and ROC as different entities but with the addition of an asterisk beside the name of Taiwan and a corresponding placard that clarified the institution's position regarding the controversy. In October 2019, Wallinger featured in a group show at Tension Fine Art alongside artists Julian Lowe and Stuart Elliot. The show \\"You Can't Tell By Looking\\" was curated by Kate Love.https://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/2840-mark-wallinger  Recognition  In 2007, Wallinger won the Turner Prize for his work, State Britain -- this was his second Turner Prize nomination. As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, in 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Mark Wallinger's Labyrinth work was elected by Londoners as one of the 10 favourite transport design icons.http://www.timeout.com/london/blog/transported-by-design-vote-for-your- favourite-part-of-london-transport-080415  Art market  Wallinger is represented by carlier  gebauer in Germany, Galerie Krinzinger in Austria, and Hauser & Wirth elsewhere. Personal life Wallinger is a supporter of the Labour Party. In October 2010, he and 100 other leading artists signed an open letter to the Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt protesting against cutbacks in the arts - he created a new work, \\"Reckless\\", for the protest.

It coincides with other holidays including Armistice Day and Remembrance Day which are celebrated in other countries that mark the anniversary of the end of World War I. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the Armistice with Germany went into effect. At the urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954. Veterans Day is distinct from Memorial Day, a U.S. public holiday in May. Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans, while Memorial Day honors those who had died while in military service. Another military holiday that also occurs in May, Armed Forces Day, honors those currently serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, Women Veterans Day is recognized by a growing number of U.S. states that specifically honors women who have served in the U.S. military. History On November 11, 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice Day, in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans: The United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President Calvin Coolidge issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies. A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year a legal holiday: \\"a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'.\\" Baltimore, Maryland, 2016 In 1945, World War II veteran Raymond Weeks from Birmingham, Alabama, had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not just those who died in World War I. Weeks led a delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the idea of National Veterans Day. Weeks led the first national celebration in 1947 in Alabama and annually until his death in 1985. President Reagan honored Weeks at the White House with the Presidential Citizenship Medal in 1982 as the driving force for the national holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared the briefing for President Reagan, determined Weeks as the \\"Father of Veterans Day.\\" U.S. representative Ed Rees from Emporia, Kansas, presented a bill establishing the holiday through Congress. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, also from Kansas, signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954. It had been eight and a half years since Weeks held his first Armistice Day celebration for all veterans. Congress amended the bill on June 1, 1954, replacing \\"Armistice\\" with \\"Veterans,\\" and it has been known as Veterans Day since. The National Veterans Award was also created in 1954. Congressman Rees of Kansas received the first National Veterans Award in Birmingham, Alabama, for his support offering legislation to make Veterans Day a federal holiday. Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance with the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Veterans Day was moved to the fourth Monday of October (October 25, 1971; October 23, 1972; October 22, 1973; October 28, 1974; October 27, 1975; October 25, 1976, and October 24, 1977). In 1978, it was moved back to its original celebration on November 11. While the legal holiday remains on November 11, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then organizations that formally observe the holiday will normally be closed on the adjacent Friday or Monday, respectively. Observance end of World War I Because it is a federal holiday, some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it falls on the weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employee can choose some other day. A Society for Human Resource Management poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011. Non- essential federal government offices are closed. No mail is delivered. All federal workers are paid for the holiday; those who are required to work on the holiday sometimes receive holiday pay for that day in addition to their wages. =Armistice Day= In his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years: \\"Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness,\\" he remarked. As Veterans Day and the birthday of the United States Marine Corps (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period. Election Day is a regular working day, while Veterans Day, which typically falls the following week, is a federal holiday. The National Commission on Federal Election Reform called for the holidays to be merged, so citizens can have a day off to vote. They state this as a way to honor voting by exercising democratic rights. =Spelling of Veterans Day= While the holiday is commonly printed as Veteran's Day or Veterans' Day in calendars and advertisements, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the attributive (no apostrophe) rather than the possessive case is the official spelling \\"because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans.\\"Veterans Day Frequently Asked Questions, Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

It not only celebrates these established songwriters, but is also involved in the development of new English language songwriting talent through workshops, showcases and scholarships. There are many programs designed to teach and discover new English language songwriters. Nile Rodgers serves as the organization's chairman. The Hall of Fame has only existed since 2010, when it was first put on display online inside the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. Until construction of the basement installation at the Brill Building in New York is completed, the Hall has no permanent place of residence, and because the awards are not televised, there would be no other digital recording of the event for posterity. There are numerous examples of collaborating songwriters being inducted in unison, with each person being considered a separate entrant. The inaugural year featured 120 inductees, many of whom had a professional partnership, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein. Burt Bacharach and Hal David followed in 1972. Betty Comden and Adolph Green were selected in 1980, and Lieber and Stoller were inducted in 1985. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were inducted in 1989 along with Gerry Goffin and Carole King as well as Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. Motown's Holland-Dozier-Holland team were honored the following year. Elton John and Bernie Taupin were among those chosen in 1992, and the pop music group the Bee Gees had all three brothers inducted in 1994. In 1995, Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe as well as Gamble and Huff were inducted. John Denver was inducted in 1996. The Eagles' Glenn Frey and Don Henley were co-inductees in 2000. Queen was the first rock band to have all their band members inducted in 2003. Five members of Earth, Wind & Fire were in the class of 2010 and four members of Kool and the Gang were honored in 2018. Through 2019, 461 individuals were inducted into the SHOF. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony was postponed until 2021. The Songwriters Hall of Fame president and CEO, Linda Moran, chose to move the event so that a proper celebration could take place. New 2020 inductees would include Mariah Carey, Chad Hugo, the Isley Brothers, Annie Lennox, Steve Miller, Rick Nowels, William ‚ÄúMickey‚Äù Stevenson, Dave Stewart and Pharrell Williams. Additionally, Jody Gerson of Universal Music Group will be given the Abe Olman Publisher Award and Paul Williams is set to receive the Johnny Mercer Award.

It may be used for the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge. It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested. The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with the more liquid sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and only a slow flow of sludge in the lower digestion chamber. The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6-9 months of digestion. The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber. Imhoff tanks are being superseded in sewage treatment by plain sedimentation tanks using mechanical methods for continuously collecting the sludge, which is moved to separate digestion tanks. This arrangement permits both improved sedimentation results and better temperature control in the digestion process, leading to a more rapid and complete digestion of the sludge. View from above an empty Imhoff Tank. A test for settleable solids in water, wastewater and stormwater uses an Imhoff cone, with or without stopcock.

Cagliostro was an Italian adventurer and self-styled magician. He became a glamorous figure associated with the royal courts of Europe where he pursued various occult arts, including psychic healing, alchemy and scrying. His reputation lingered for many decades after his death, but continued to deteriorate, as he came to be regarded as a charlatan and impostor, this view fortified by the savage attack of Thomas Carlyle (1795‚Äì1881) in 1833, who pronounced him the \\"Quack of Quacks\\". Later works‚Äîsuch as that of W.R.H. Trowbridge (1866-1938) in his Cagliostro: the Splendour and Misery of a Master of Magic (1910), attempted a rehabilitation. Biography=Origin= The history of Cagliostro is shrouded in rumour, propaganda, and mysticism. Some effort was expended to ascertain his true identity when he was arrested because of possible participation in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe relates in his Italian Journey that the identification of Cagliostro with Giuseppe Balsamo was ascertained by a lawyer from Palermo who, upon official request, had sent a dossier with copies of the pertinent documents to France. Goethe met the lawyer in April 1787 and saw the documents and Balsamo's pedigree: Balsamo's great-grandfather Matteo Martello had two daughters: Maria, who married Giuseppe Bracconeri; and Vincenza, who married Giuseppe Cagliostro. Maria and Giuseppe Bracconeri had three children: Matteo; Antonia; and Felicit√†, who married Pietro Balsamo (the son of a bookseller, Antonino Balsamo, who had declared bankruptcy before dying at age 44). The son of Felicit√† and Pietro Balsamo was Giuseppe, who was christened with the name of his great-uncle and eventually adopted his surname, too. Felicit√† Balsamo was still alive in Palermo at the time of Goethe's travels in Italy, and he visited her and her daughter. Goethe wrote that Cagliostro was of Jewish origin,Italian Journey, p.205 and it may be that the name \\"Balsamo\\" comes from the hebrew Baal Shem (Cagliostro himself publicly ascertained that he was a disciple of Haƒ©m Falk, the Baal Shem of London). Cagliostro himself stated during the trial following the Affair of the Diamond Necklace that he had been born of Christians of noble birth but abandoned as an orphan upon the island of Malta. He claimed to have travelled as a child to Medina, Mecca, and Cairo and upon return to Malta to have been admitted to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, with whom he studied alchemy, the Kabbalah, and magic. =Early life= Giuseppe Balsamo was born to a poor family in Albergheria, which was once the old Jewish Quarter of Palermo, Sicily. Despite his family's precarious financial situation, his grandfather and uncles made sure the young Giuseppe received a solid education: he was taught by a tutor and later became a novice in the Catholic Order of St. John of God, from which he was eventually expelled. During his period as a novice in the order, Balsamo learned chemistry as well as a series of spiritual rites. In 1764, when he was twenty one, he convinced Vincenzo Marano‚Äîa wealthy goldsmith‚Äîof the existence of a hidden treasure buried several hundred years previously at Mount Pellegrino. The young man's knowledge of the occult, Marano reasoned, would be valuable in preventing the duo from being attacked by magical creatures guarding the treasure. In preparation for the expedition to Mount Pellegrino, however, Balsamo requested seventy pieces of silver from Marano. When the time came for the two to dig up the supposed treasure, Balsamo attacked Marano, who was left bleeding and wondering what had happened to the boy‚Äîin his mind, the beating he had been subjected to had been the work of djinns. The next day, Marano paid a visit to Balsamo's house in via Perciata (since then renamed via Conte di Cagliostro), where he learned the young man had left the city. Balsamo (accompanied by two accomplices) had fled to the city of Messina. By 1765‚Äì66, Balsamo found himself on the island of Malta, where he became an auxiliary (donato) for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and a skilled pharmacist. =Travels= Lorenza Seraphina Feliciani, his wife 19th-century illustration of a Cagliostro performance in Dresden In early 1768 Balsamo left for Rome, where he managed to land himself a job as a secretary to Cardinal Orsini.The cardinal in question would have been Domenico Orsini d'Aragona (1719‚Äì1789), nephew of Pope Benedict XIII. Miranda, \\"Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church\\". The job proved boring to Balsamo and he soon started leading a double life, selling magical \\"Egyptian\\" amulets and engravings pasted on boards and painted over to look like paintings.Iain McCalman: The Seven Ordeals of Count Cagliostro, 2004: Flamingo (Australia) and Random House (UK); published in the US as The Last Alchemist by HarperCollins. Of the many Sicilian expatriates and ex-convicts he met during this period, one introduced him to a seventeen-year-old girl named Lorenza Seraphina Feliciani (ca. 8 April 1751 ‚Äì 1794), known as Serafina, whom he married 1768. The couple moved in with Lorenza's parents and her brother in the vicolo delle Cripte, adjacent to the strada dei Pellegrini. Balsamo's coarse language and the way he incited Lorenza to display her body contrasted deeply with her parents' deep-rooted religious beliefs. After a heated discussion, the young couple left. At this point Balsamo befriended Agliata, a forger and swindler, who proposed to teach Balsamo how to forge letters, diplomas and myriad other official documents. In return, though, Agliata sought sexual intercourse with Balsamo's young wife, a request to which Balsamo acquiesced. The couple traveled together to London, where Balsamo, now styling himself with one of several pseudonyms and self- conferred titles before settling on \\"Count Alessandro di Cagliostro\\", allegedly met the Comte de Saint-Germain. Cagliostro traveled throughout Europe, especially to Courland, Russia, Poland, Germany, and later France. His fame grew to the point that he was even recommended as a physician to Benjamin Franklin during a stay in Paris. On 12 April 1777 \\"Joseph Cagliostro\\" was admitted as a Freemason of the Esp√©rance Lodge No. 289 in Gerrard Street, Soho, London.See Reinhard Markner: Cagliostro‚Äôs Initiation: His 1777 Grand Lodge Certificate Rediscovered, in The Square, Sept. 2019, p. 23. . In December 1777 Cagliostro and Serafina left London for the mainland, after which they travelled through various German states, visiting lodges of the Rite of Strict Observance looking for converts to Cagliostro's \\"Egyptian Freemasonry\\". In February 1779 Cagliostro traveled to Mitau, where he met the poetess Elisa von der Recke. In September 1780, after failing in Saint Petersburg to win the patronage of Russian Tsaritsa Catherine the Great, the Cagliostros made their way to Strasbourg, at that time in France. In October 1784, the Cagliostros travelled to Lyon. On 24 December 1784 they founded the co-Masonic mother lodge La Sagesse Triomphante of his rite of Egyptian Freemasonry at Lyon. In January 1785 Cagliostro and his wife went to Paris in response to the entreaties of Cardinal Rohan. =Affair of the diamond necklace= Satire on Cagliostro at a Masonic meeting in London in 1786, by James Gillray Cagliostro was prosecuted in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace which involved Marie Antoinette and Prince Louis de Rohan, and was held in the Bastille for nine months but finally acquitted, when no evidence could be found connecting him to the affair. Nonetheless, he was banished from France by order of Louis XVI, and departed for England. There he was accused by French expatriate Theveneau de Morande of being Giuseppe Balsamo, which he denied in his published Open Letter to the English People, forcing a retraction and apology from Morande. =Betrayal, imprisonment, and death= Cagliostro left England to visit Rome, where he met two people who proved to be spies of the Inquisition. Some accounts hold that his wife was the one who initially betrayed him to the Inquisition. On 27 December 1789 he was arrested and imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. He was tried and originally sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment at the Forte di San Leo, where he would die on 26 August 1795. Legacy Portuguese author Camilo Castelo Branco credits to Balsamo the creation of the Egyptian Rite of the Freemasons and intensive work in the diffusion of Freemasonry, by opening lodges all over Europe and by introducing the acceptance of women into the community. The idea of an \\"Egyptian freemasonry\\" was maintained in Italy by the Rite of Misraim, founded in 1813 by the three Jewish B√©darride brothers and in France, the Rite of Memphis founded in 1838 by Jacques Etienne Marconis de N√®gre; these unified under Giuseppe Garibaldi as the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misra√Øm in 1881. Cagliostro was an extraordinary forger.

Occult historian Lewis Spence comments in his entry on Cagliostro that the swindler put his finagled wealth to good use by starting and funding a chain of maternity hospitals and orphanages around the continent.

He is best known for his comic operas such as Il segreto di Susanna (1909). A number of his works were based on plays by Carlo Goldoni, including Le donne curiose (1903), I quatro rusteghi (1906) and Il campiello (1936). Life Ermanno Wolf- Ferrari was born in Venice in 1876, the son of German painter August Wolf and Emilia Ferrari, from Venice. He added his mother's maiden-name, Ferrari, to his surname in 1895. Although he studied piano from an early age, music was not the primary passion of his young life. As a teenager Wolf-Ferrari wanted to be a painter like his father; he studied intensively in Venice and Rome and traveled abroad to study in Munich. It was there that he decided to concentrate instead on music, taking lessons from Josef Rheinberger. He enrolled at the Munich conservatory and began taking counterpoint and composition classes. These initially casual music classes eventually completely eclipsed his art studies, and music took over Wolf-Ferrari's life. He wrote his first works in the 1890s. Bust of Wolf-Ferrari in the Wolf- Ferrari-Haus, Ottobrunn At age 19, Wolf-Ferrari left the conservatory and traveled home to Venice. There he worked as a choral conductor, married, had a son called Federico Wolf-Ferrari, and met both Arrigo Boito and Verdi. In 1900, having failed to have two previous efforts published, Wolf-Ferrari saw the first performance of one of his operas, Cenerentola, based on the story of Cinderella. The opera was a failure in Italy, and the humiliated young composer moved back to Munich. German audiences would prove more appreciative of his work; a revised version of Cenerentola was a hit in Bremen in 1902, while the cantata La vita nuova brought the young composer international fame. Wolf-Ferrari now began transforming the wild and witty farces of the 18th- century Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni into comic operas. The resulting works were musically eclectic, melodic, and utterly hilarious; every single one became an international success. In fact, until the outbreak of World War I, Wolf-Ferrari's operas were among the most performed in the world. In 1902 he became professor of composition and director of the Liceo Benedetto Marcello. In 1911 Wolf-Ferrari tried his hand at full-blooded Verismo with I gioielli della Madonna; a story of passion, sacrilege and madness. It was quite popular in its day and for a period after, especially in Chicago, where the great Polish soprano Rosa Raisa made it a celebrated vehicle. Maria Jeritza (and, later, Florence Easton) triumphed in it at the Metropolitan Opera, in an all-out spectacular production in 1926. World War I, however, was a nightmare for Wolf-Ferrari. The young composer, who had been dividing his time between Munich and Venice, suddenly found his two countries at war with each other. With the outbreak of the War, he moved to Zurich and composed much less, though he still wrote another comedy, Gli amanti sposi (1916). A new melancholy vein appeared in his post-war work; his operas grew darker and more emotionally complex. San Michele cemetery. He did not really pick up his rate of output until the 1920s, when he wrote Das Himmelskleid (1925) and Sly (1927), the latter based on William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. In 1939 he became professor of composition at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. In 1946 he moved again to Z√ºrich before returning to his home city of Venice. He died in Venice at Palazzo Malipiero and is buried in the Venetian cemetery Island of San Michele. Music As well as his operas, Wolf-Ferrari wrote a number of instrumental works, mainly at the very beginning and very end of his career. Only his violin concerto has ever been performed with anything approaching regularity, though he also wrote Idillio-concertino (essentially a chamber symphony), various pieces of chamber music including a piano quintet and two piano trios, three violin sonatas and a number of works for the organ amongst others. Wolf-Ferrari's work is not performed very widely (with the exception of several of his overtures and his Jewels of the Madonna intermezzo) although he is generally thought of as probably the finest writer of Italian comic opera of his time. His works often recall the opera buffa of the 18th century, although he also wrote more ambitious works in the manner of Pietro Mascagni, which are thought of less well.

Most of its area is part of the temperate rain forest WWF ecoregion, itself part of the larger Pacific temperate rain forest WWF ecoregion, and is remote enough to be home to many species of endangered and rare flora and fauna. The Tongass, which is managed by the United States Forest Service, encompasses islands of the Alexander Archipelago, fjords and glaciers, and peaks of the Coast Mountains. An international border with Canada (British Columbia) runs along the crest of the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains.See also: Alaska boundary dispute The forest is administered from Forest Service offices in Ketchikan. There are local ranger district offices located in Craig, Hoonah, Juneau, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, Thorne Bay, Wrangell, and Yakutat.USFS Ranger Districts by State History The Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve was established by Theodore Roosevelt in a presidential proclamation of 20 August 1902. Another presidential proclamation made by Roosevelt, on 10 September 1907, created the Tongass National Forest. On 1 July 1908, the two forests were joined, and the combined forest area encompassed most of Southeast Alaska. Further presidential proclamations of 16 February 1909 (in the last months of the Roosevelt administration) and 10 June, and in 1925 (by Calvin Coolidge) expanded the Tongass. An early supervisor of the forest was William Alexander Langille.Indian River protection (accessed 8 July 2010). On 4 September 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866 crashed in the Tongass National Forest, killing all 111 people on board. =Aboriginal Title= After the creation of the Tongass National Forest, the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska formed to challenge the Federal Government's rights to the land in 1935. In Tlingit and Haida Indians of Alaska v. United States, the court found Alaskan Natives held established aboriginal title by their \\"exclusive use and occupancy of that territory from time immemorial.\\" The court found the Alaska Treaty of Cessation between Russia and the United States did not extinguish Aboriginal Title to the land, and that the creation of the Tongass National Forest constituted a taking of land from the Tlingit and Haida. In 1968, with a settlement that valued the Togasss at about 43 cents an acre. The value was based on land at the time of the taking, without inflation or interest. =Logging= Forest Service map of the Tongass, with National Monuments and Wilderness Areas Timber harvest in Southeast Alaska consisted of individual handlogging operations up until the 1950s, focusing on lowlying areas and beach fringe areas. In the 1950s, in part to aid in Japanese recovery from World War II, the Forest Service set up long-term contracts with two pulp mills: the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) and the Alaska Pulp Company. These contracts were scheduled to last 50 years, and originally intended to complement independent sawlog operations in the region. However, the two companies conspired to drive log prices down, put smaller logging operations out of business, and were major and recalcitrant polluters in their local areas. Ultimately, virtually all timber sales in the Tongass were purchased by one of these two companies. In 1974, the exclusive KPC contract for 800,000 acres of old growth forest on Prince of Wales Island was challenged by the Point Baker Association led by Alan Stein,Finding Aid to the Alan Stein papers Chuck Zieske and Herb Zieske. Federal District Court judge James von der Heydt ruled in their favor in December 1975ZIESKE v. BUTZ, 406 F.Supp. 258 (1975), United States District Court, D. Alaska.

Decision of 5 May 1976. enjoining clearcutting of over of the north end of Prince of Wales Island. The suit threatened to halt clearcutting in the United States. In 1976, Congress removed the Zieske injunction in passing the National Forest Management Act.Parent, S. 1992. THE NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT ACT: OUT OF THE WOODS AND BACK TO THE COURTS? Lewis & Clark Law School. [ Over half the old growth timber was removed there by the mid 1990s. The battle for buffer strips, to protect salmon streams from logging, which began in the Zieske v Butz lawsuit, continued through comments submitted to the major US Forest Service Environmental Impact Statements issued in subsequent 5-year intervals starting in 1979, and continuing in the 1988 EIS. Finally, in 1990, a Federal District Court in Alaska, in a case called Stein v Barton, held the US Forest Service had to protect all salmon streams in the Tongass with buffer strips. One of the claims in Stein v Barton for protection of the Salmon Bay Watershed was partially enacted into law when Congress Passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act; however environmental lobbyists compromised with Senator Ted Stevens leaving the most valuable forest available to logging in the headwaters of the salmon streams therein. Much of the power of these companies lay in the long-term contracts themselves. The contracts guaranteed low prices to the pulp companies ‚Äì in some cases resulting in trees being given away for \\"less than the price of a hamburger.\\" The Tongass Timber Reform Act, enacted in 1990, significantly reshaped the logging industry's relationship with the Tongass National Forest. The law's provisions cancelled a $40 million annual subsidy for timber harvest; established several new wilderness areas and closed others to logging; and required that future cutting under the 50-year pulp contracts be subject to environmental review and limitations on old-growth harvest. Alaska Pulp Corporation and Ketchikan Pulp Corporation claimed that the new restrictions made them uncompetitive and closed down their mills in 1993 and 1997, respectively, and the Forest Service then cancelled the remainders of the two 50-year timber contracts.Steiner, R. 1998. Deforestation in Alaska's Coastal rainforest: causes and solutions. Univ. of Alaska. In 2003, an appropriations bill rider required that all timber sales in the Tongass must be positive sales, meaning no sales could be sold that undervalued the \\"stumpage\\" rate, or the value of the trees as established by the marketplace (2008 Appropriations Bill P.L. 110-161, H. Rept. 110-497, Sec. 411). However, the Forest Service also conducts NEPA analyses, layout, and administrative operations to support these sales, and as such, the government does not make a profit overall. Given the guaranteed low prices during contract days and the continued high cost of logging in Southeast Alaska today, one analysis concludes that, since 1980, the Forest Service has lost over one billion dollars in Tongass timber sales.Temperate Rainforests of the North Pacific Coast (accessed 16 May 2007). Logging operations are not the only deficit-run programs, however. The Forest Service likens the overall deficit of the timber harvest program to the many other programs the agency operates at a deficit, including trail, cabin, and campground maintenance and subsistence programs. High-grading (preferentially targeting for logging the most profitable forest types) has been prevalent in the Tongass throughout the era of industrial- scale logging there.The Wildlife Society, Alaska Chapter, 2003. Comments to the Chief of the Forest Service on the exemption of the Tongass National Forest from the roadless rule. Aug. 8, 2003. For example, the forest type with the largest concentration of big trees‚Äîvolume class 7‚Äîoriginally comprised only 4% of the forested portion of the Tongass, and over two-thirds of it has been logged.Tongass Land Management Plan Supplemental EIS, 1991. Other high-grading has concentrated on stands of Alaska cedar and red cedar. The karst terrain often produces large trees and has fewer muskeg bogs, and has also been preferentially logged. As of 2008, the Forest Service has released a new amendment to the Forest Plan for the Tongass Forest. =Roadless controversy= A stream in the forest The most controversial logging in the Tongass has involved the roadless areas. Southeast Alaska is an extensive landscape, with communities scattered across the archipelago on different islands, isolated from each other and the mainland road system. The road system that exists in the region is in place because of the resource extraction history in the region, primarily established by the Forest Service to enable timber harvest. Once in place, these roads serve to connect local communities and visitors to recreation, hunting, fishing, and subsistence opportunities long into the future. However, installing roads in the vast wilderness areas of the Tongass is also a point of controversy for many in the American public, as reflected in the roadless area conservation movement, which has opposed further road construction on the grounds that it would promote habitat fragmentation, diminish wildlife populations and damage salmon spawning streams. Further, they argue that existing roads are sufficient. The Tongass National Forest was included in the Roadless Initiative passed on 5 January 2001, during the last days of the Bill Clinton Administration, and the initiative prevented the construction of new roads in currently roadless areas of United States national forests. In September 2006, a landmark court decision overturned Bush's repeal of the Roadless Rule, reverting to the 2001 roadless area protections established under president Clinton. However, the Tongass remained exempt from that ruling. In June 2007, U.S. House members added an amendment to the appropriations bill to block federally funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the Republicans for Environmental Protection. Representative Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the amendment, said, \\"I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime‚Ä¶ But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense.\\" In July 2009, the Obama Administration approved clearcut logging on in the remaining old growth forests of a Tongass National Forest roadless area. The timber sale was permanently stopped by a lawsuit.Los Angeles Times editorial, 21 December 2009. Logging illogic.US District Court, Alaska. 7 December 2009. Order and Opinion in case 1:09-cv-00003-JWS. In March 2011, Judge John Sedwick from the Anchorage federal district court, in his ruling,A court order, ruling the Tongass exemption from the Roadless Rule invalid, Judge Sedwick (U.S. Dist. Court, Anchorage), 4 March 2011 reinstated the Roadless Rule on roadless areas in the Tongass, but with three of the Forest Service's recent timber projects excluded from that ruling \\"without prejudice.\\" Those projects were Iyouktug Timber Sales ROD (record of decision), Scratchings Timber Sale ROD II, and Kuiu Timber Sale Area ROD. The Order concluded in part: In October 2019, the Trump administration instructed federal officials to reverse the limits of tree cutting at the request of Alaska's top elected officials, including Senator Lisa Murkowski and Governor Michael J. Dunleavy. In a statement, Forest Service officials said the new plan would be subject to public comment for 60 days. Description Known by the U.S. Forest Service as the \\"crown jewel\\", the Tongass stretches across 17 million acres of land and is Alaska's largest National Forest. Alaska Wilderness League describes the Tongass as \\"one of the last remaining intact temperate rainforests in the world\\". 70,000 people inhabit the region. While the timber industry dominated the economy for a long time, the region has transitioned into \\"non-timber... [sources of revenue] such as recreation, subsistence food, salmon, scientific use, and carbon sequestration [which] contributes more than $2 billion\\" annually. Tourism supports over 10,000 jobs in the Tongass National Forest, with about 10% being related to fishing activities. Three Alaska Native nations live in Southeast Alaska: the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. Thirty- one communities are located within the forest; the largest is Juneau, the state capital, with a population of 31,000. The forest is named for the Tongass group of the Tlingit people, who inhabited the southernmost areas of Southeast Alaska, near what is now the city of Ketchikan. Ecology Misty Fjords Waterfall and kayak The Tongass includes parts of the Northern Pacific coastal forests and Pacific Coastal Mountain icefields and tundra ecoregions. Along with the Central and North Coast regions of British Columbia designated as the Great Bear Rainforest, the Tongass is part of the \\"perhumid rainforest zone\\", and the forest is primarily made up of western red cedar, sitka spruce, and western hemlock. The Tongass is Earth's largest remaining temperate rainforest. The terrain underlying the forest is divided between karst (limestone rock, well-drained soil, and many caves) and granite (poorly drained soil). Unique and protected creatures seldom found anywhere else in North America inhabit the thousands of islands along the Alaska coast. Five species of salmon, brown and black bears, and bald eagles abound throughout the forest. Other terrestrial animals include wolves, mountain goats, ravens, and sitka black-tailed deer. Many migratory birds spend summer months nesting among the archipelago, notably the Arctic tern. Orca and humpback whales, sea lions, seals, sea otters, river otters, and porpoises swim offshore. The Tongass is also home to steelhead and salmon. Though its land area is huge, about 40% of the Tongass is composed of wetlands, snow, ice, rock, and non- forest vegetation, while the remaining are forested. About are considered \\"productive old-growth\\", and of those are preserved as wilderness areas.Tongass Forest Management FAQs (accessed 18 September 2008). Historically, logging operations tended to concentrate on lower-elevation, bigger-tree ecosystems for harvesting; at present, approximately 78% of the land remains intact, i.e. out of original big-tree, low-elevation forest area. Given the high value of these areas for wildlife species, close to 70% of this old growth forest is protected in reserves and will never be eligible for harvest.Tongass National Forest Land Management Plan Final EIS (PDF). (See tables 3.7-9 and 3.9-12. Accessed 18 September 2008). Major disturbances in the Tongass National Forest include windfall and landslides. Local winter windstorms referred to as the \\"Takus\\" can affect the structure of some stands and often cause single-tree blow-downs. Of all the old growth in the forest, no more than 11% of the remaining area will ever be harvested. Of the of \\"productive old-growth\\" in the forest, , or 12% of the total old-growth, are slated for harvest over the next 10 years. Current harvesting plans call for a phase-out of old-growth harvesting, to be replaced by rotation harvesting of managed second-growth forests.Transition for Tongass. The Ecological Atlas of Southeast Alaska, published by Audubon Alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the region's landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources. =Wilderness areas= There are 19 designated wilderness areas within the Tongass National Forest, more than in any other national forest. They contain over of territory,National Wilderness Areas by State, 14 November 2008, United States Forest Service also more than any other. From largest to smallest, they are: * Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness * Kootznoowoo Wilderness * Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness * Stikine-LeConte Wilderness * Russell Fjord Wilderness * South Baranof Wilderness * West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness * Endicott River Wilderness * South Prince of Wales Wilderness * South Etolin Wilderness * Chuck River Wilderness * Tebenkof Bay Wilderness * Kuiu Wilderness * Petersburg Creek-Duncan Salt Chuck Wilderness * Karta River Wilderness * Pleasant/Lemesurier/Inian Islands Wilderness * Coronation Island Wilderness * Warren Island Wilderness * Maurille Islands Wilderness There are three other wilderness areas within the Alaska Panhandle region that are not part of the Tongass National Forest, but are administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. From largest to smallest they are the Forrester Island Wilderness, the Saint Lazaria Wilderness, and the Hazy Islands Wilderness. Also in Southeast Alaska, but not in the Tongass National Forest, are the Glacier Bay Wilderness and a small part of the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness, which are both administered by the National Park Service. Recreation Eagle Glacier Memorial Cabin, located near Juneau in the Tongass National Forest A forest path in the Tongass National Forest The Tongass National Forest offers recreation opportunities, some of which are found only in Alaska. The forest has close to one million visitors each year. Most come by cruise ships arriving through the Inside Passage of Southeast Alaska. The Forest Service provides visitor programs at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau and the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan. The Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, built in 1962, was the first Forest Service visitor center in the nation. The forest interpretive program on the state ferries began in the summer of 1968, and was the longest-running naturalist program in the agency until ending in 2013. Native inholdings Native corporation lands are those designated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA). This Act conveyed approximately of Federal land in Alaska to private native corporations which were created under the ANCSA. of those lands were hand- picked old growth areas of the Tongass National Forest and are still surrounded by public National Forest land. These lands are now privately held and under the management of Sealaska Corporation, one of the native regional corporations created under the ANCSA. Transference of public National Forest land to a privately owned corporation removes it from protection by Federal law and allows the owners to use the land in whatever way they see fit without regard to the effects of the use on surrounding lands and ecosystems. This fact has caused much controversy involving the business interests of Native Regional Corporations and the personal interests of local Native and non- Native residents of Southeastern Alaska. Currently Sealaska, a native regional corporation created under the ANCSA is asking for an amendment to the Act that would distribute additional land to Alaskan Natives. When Sealaska was created, it was promised additional land that was unavailable at the time due to contracts with pulp mills; much of this original land is now under water or in a watershed, and consequently Sealaska has requested different land. On 23 April 2009, Senator Murkowski and U.S. Rep. Don Young introduced a revised Sealaska bill (S. 881 and H.R 2099) that requests public lands that are both economically valuable and environmentally delicate. Starting with the next session of Congress in 2011, Senator Murkowski reintroduced a slightly modified version of the Sealaska Bill and Representative Don Young introduced a companion bill (S 730 and HR 1408). While HR 1408 was passed out of the Natural Resources Committee, S 730 remains in the Natural Resources Committee of the Senate. Known as the Sealaska Lands Bill, the removal of 91,000 acres from the regulatory protections of the USFS and transfer of the land to Sealaska, a for profit corporation, created a huge controversy in South East Alaska. A study released by Audubon Alaska on 22 February 2012 showed that the Sealaska selection of the largest trees in areas designated in S 730 and HR 1408 is 1200 percent greater than the occurrence of these trees in the Tongass as a whole. There is strong opposition to passage of S 881 coming from seven communities in the Tongass, most on Prince of Wales Island. In addition, there are fears expressed by the Territorial Sportsmen that the northern goshawk will be listed as endangered if the bill is passed. Similar concerns were expressed by the Alaska Outdoor Council in letters to Senators Murkowski and Begich and Governor Parnell.

He was the younger son of Demetrius II and Cleopatra Thea. He may have spent his early life in Athens and returned to Syria after the deaths of his father and brother Seleucus V. At first he was joint ruler with his mother. Fearing her influence, Antiochus VIII had Cleopatra Thea poisoned in 121 BC. Political instability affected most of Antiochus VIII's reign. From 116 BC he fought a civil war against his half-brother Antiochus IX. Antiochus VIII's wife, the Ptolemaic Egyptian princess Tryphaena, had her sister and the wife of Antiochus IX, the former Cleopatra IV of Egypt, murdered in 112 BC; Antiochus IX killed Tryphaena in revenge. In 102 BC, Antiochus VIII's aunt Cleopatra III of Egypt, the mother of the two rival queens, gave him the hand of her daughter Cleopatra Selene in marriage. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC. Biography=Family background and childhood= In 193 BC Cleopatra I, a Seleucid princess, married King Ptolemy V of Egypt. Their granddaughter Cleopatra Thea of the Ptolemaic dynasty married the Syrian claimant Alexander Balas half a century later in 150 BC. She later married Demetrius II of Syria, and they had two sons. Demetrius II was captured and held as a prisoner by the Parthian Empire. Antiochus VIII's uncle Antiochus VII took the throne and married Cleopatra Thea, but died in 129 BC while fighting against the Parthians; Demetrius II then returned to the throne, and died in 125 BC while waging a war for the Syrian throne against the claimant Alexander II. Demetrius II's eldest son Seleucus V became king after his death, but was soon killed by Cleopatra Thea. She made Antiochus VIII king, ruling as his co- regent. =Rise to power= Shortly after taking the throne, Antiochus VIII married his cousin, the Ptolemaic princess Tryphaena. Silver and bronze coins issued during the co-regency (125‚Äì121BC) of Antiochus VIII and Cleopatra Thea show the head of the queen appearing at front with her son's head behind hers. Her name is also the first listed on the coinage. These facts signify that she was the senior co-ruler. He defeated usurper Alexander II Zabinas in 123 BC. In 121 BC, Antiochus decided to rid himself of his influential mother. According to Justin, his mother tried to poison him with wine, but the suspicious king forced her to drink the cup herself. However, it was Grypus himself who would become famous for his interest in toxicology.Galen, 14 p. 185 Some poems about poisonous herbs believed to have been written by him are quoted by the famous physician Galen. =Reign as King of Syria= Sandan standing on the horned lion, in his pyre surmounted by an eagle. Despite political shortcomings, Grypus was a popular king. His ugly, lazy appearance on coins (common among the last Seleucids), together with stories of his lavish banquets, made posterity believe his dynasty was degenerate and decadent. This was, however, a conscious image invoking the Hellenistic concept of Tryphe - meaning good life, which the last Seleucids strove to be associated with, as opposed to the exhausting civil wars and feuds which troubled their reigns in reality. A story of his luxurious parties claims he sent food home with guests who attended banquets, complete with a camel as beast of burden, as well as an attendant to carry the guest himself. This should certainly have caused some strain on the already depleted treasury. =Civil War= In 116 BC his half-brother and cousin Antiochus IX Cyzicenus returned from exile and a civil war began. Cyzicenus' wife, also named Cleopatra, was a sister of Tryphaena and was eventually killed in a dramatic fashion in the temple of Daphne outside Antioch, on the order of Tryphaena. Cyzicenus eventually killed Tryphaena as revenge. The two brothers then divided Syria between them until Grypus was killed by his minister Heracleon in 96 BC. Family He married the Ptolemaic princess Tryphaena ca. 125, and had six children by her: * Seleucus VI Epiphanes * Antiochus XI Epiphanes Philadelphus * Philip I Philadelphus * Demetrius III Eucaerus * Antiochus XII Dionysus * Laodice VII Thea, married to king Mithridates I Callinicus of Commagene as part of a settlement by Mithridates' father Sames II Theosebes Dikaios to ensure peace between the Kingdom of Commagene and the Seleucid Empire. Laodice and Mithridates' son was King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, grandson to Grypus. In 102, Cleopatra III of Egypt gave him her daughter Cleopatra Selene I in marriage, but she gave him no children. Afterwards, she went to marry Antiochus IX Cyzicenus.

Calculated hydrocarbon boundaries of the lipid bilayer are indicated by red and blue lines. Membrane proteins are common proteins that are part of, or interact with, biological membranes. Membrane proteins fall into several broad categories depending on their location. Integral membrane proteins are a permanent part of a cell membrane and can either penetrate the membrane (transmembrane) or associate with one or the other side of a membrane (integral monotopic). Peripheral membrane proteins are transiently associated with the cell membrane. Membrane proteins are common, and medically important‚Äîabout a third of all human proteins are membrane proteins, and these are targets for more than half of all drugs. Nonetheless, compared to other classes of proteins, determining membrane protein structures remains a challenge in large part due to the difficulty in establishing experimental conditions that can preserve the correct conformation of the protein in isolation from its native environment.  Function  Membrane proteins perform a variety of functions vital to the survival of organisms: * Membrane receptor proteins relay signals between the cell's internal and external environments. * Transport proteins move molecules and ions across the membrane. They can be categorized according to the Transporter Classification database. * Membrane enzymes may have many activities, such as oxidoreductase, transferase or hydrolase. * Cell adhesion molecules allow cells to identify each other and interact. For example, proteins involved in immune response The localization of proteins in membranes can be predicted reliably using hydrophobicity analyses of protein sequences, i.e. the localization of hydrophobic amino acid sequences. =Integral membrane proteins= Schematic representation of transmembrane proteins: 1. a single transmembrane Œ±-helix (bitopic membrane protein) 2. a polytopic transmembrane Œ±-helical protein 3. a polytopic transmembrane Œ≤-sheet protein The membrane is represented in light-brown. Integral membrane proteins are permanently attached to the membrane. Such proteins can be separated from the biological membranes only using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents. One such example of this type of protein which has not been functionally characterized yet is SMIM23. They can be classified according to their relationship with the bilayer: * Integral polytopic proteins are transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane more than once. These proteins may have different transmembrane topology. These proteins have one of two structural architectures: **Helix bundle proteins, which are present in all types of biological membranes; ** Beta barrel proteins, which are found only in outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, and outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. * Bitopic proteins are transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane only once. Transmembrane helices from these proteins have significantly different amino acid distributions to transmembrane helices from polytopic proteins. * Integral monotopic proteins are integral membrane proteins that are attached to only one side of the membrane and do not span the whole way across. =Peripheral membrane proteins= Schematic representation of the different types of interaction between monotopic membrane proteins and the cell membrane: 1. interaction by an amphipathic Œ±-helix parallel to the membrane plane (in-plane membrane helix) 2. interaction by a hydrophobic loop 3. interaction by a covalently bound membrane lipid (lipidation) 4. electrostatic or ionic interactions with membrane lipids (e.g. through a calcium ion) Peripheral membrane proteins are temporarily attached either to the lipid bilayer or to integral proteins by a combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic, and other non-covalent interactions. Peripheral proteins dissociate following treatment with a polar reagent, such as a solution with an elevated pH or high salt concentrations. Integral and peripheral proteins may be post-translationally modified, with added fatty acid, diacylglycerol or prenyl chains, or GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol), which may be anchored in the lipid bilayer. =Polypeptide toxins= Polypeptide toxins and many antibacterial peptides, such as colicins or hemolysins, and certain proteins involved in apoptosis, are sometimes considered a separate category. These proteins are water-soluble but can aggregate and associate irreversibly with the lipid bilayer and become reversibly or irreversibly membrane-associated.  In genomes  Membrane proteins, like soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins, are common. It is estimated that 20‚Äì30% of all genes in most genomes encode for membrane proteins. For instance, about 1000 of the ~4200 proteins of E. coli are thought to be membrane proteins, 600 of which have been experimentally verified to be membrane resident. In humans, current thinking suggests that fully 30% of the genome encodes membrane proteins.  In disease  Membrane proteins are the targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. Among the human diseases in which membrane proteins have been implicated are heart disease, Alzheimer's and cystic fibrosis.  Purification of membrane proteins  Although membrane proteins play an important role in all organisms, their purification has historically, and continues to be, a huge challenge for protein scientists. In 2008, 150 unique structures of membrane proteins were available, and by 2019 only 50 human membrane proteins had had their structures elucidated. In contrast approximately 25% of all proteins are membrane proteins. Their hydrophobic surfaces make structural and especially functional characterization difficult. Detergents can be used to render membrane proteins water soluble, but these can also alter protein structure and function. Making membrane proteins water soluble can also be achieved through engineering the protein sequence, replacing selected hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic ones, taking great care to maintain secondary structure while revising overall charge. Affinity chromatography is one of the best solutions for purification of membrane proteins. The activity of membrane proteins decreases very fast in contrast to other proteins. So affinity chromatography provides a fast and specific purification of membrane proteins. The polyhistidine-tag is a commonly used tag for membrane protein purification, and the alternative rho1D4 tag has also been successfully used.

The membrane is represented in light yellow. A transmembrane protein (TP) is a type of integral membrane protein that spans the entirety of the cell membrane. Many transmembrane proteins function as gateways to permit the transport of specific substances across the membrane. They frequently undergo significant conformational changes to move a substance through the membrane. They are usually highly hydrophobic and aggregate and precipitate in water. They require detergents or nonpolar solvents for extraction, although some of them (beta-barrels) can be also extracted using denaturing agents. The peptide sequence that spans the membrane, or the transmembrane segment, is largely hydrophobic and can be visualized using the hydropathy plot. Depending on the number of transmembrane segments, transmembrane proteins can be classified as single-span (or bitopic) or multi-span (polytopic). Some other integral membrane proteins are called monotopic, meaning that they are also permanently attached to the membrane, but do not pass through it. Types=Classification by structure= There are two basic types of transmembrane proteins: alpha-helical and beta-barrels. Alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotes, and sometimes in the outer membranes.alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include Stannin and certain lipoproteins, and others This is the major category of transmembrane proteins. In humans, 27% of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins. Beta-barrel proteins are so far found only in outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, cell walls of gram-positive bacteria, outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts, or can be secreted as pore-forming toxins. All beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have simplest up-and-down topology, which may reflect their common evolutionary origin and similar folding mechanism. In addition to the protein domains, there are unusual transmembrane elements formed by peptides. Typical example is Gramicidin A, a peptide that forms a dimeric transmembrane Œ≤-helix. This peptide is secreted by Gram-positive bacteria as an antibiotic. A transmembrane polyproline-II helix has not been reported in natural proteins. Nonetheless, this structure was experimentally observed in specifically designed artificial peptides. =Classification by topology= This classification refers to the position of the protein N- and C-termini on the different sides of the lipid bilayer. Types I, II, III and IV are single- pass molecules. Type I transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on cell membranes). Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains targeted to the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain targeted to the lumen.Harvey Lodish etc.; Molecular Cell Biology, Sixth edition, p.546 The implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type. Group I and II transmembrane proteins have opposite final topologies. Group I proteins have the N terminus on the far side and C terminus on the cytosolic side. Group II proteins have the C terminus on the far side and N terminus in the cytosol. However final topology not the only criterion for defining transmembrane protein groups, rather location of topogenic determinants and mechanism of assembly is considered in the classification 3D structure Increase in the number of 3D structures of membrane proteins known Membrane protein structures can be determined by X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy or NMR spectroscopy. The most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel. The portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer (see annular lipid shell) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids.White, Stephen. \\"General Principle of Membrane Protein Folding and Stability\\". Stephen White Laboratory Homepage. 10 Nov. 2009. web. Membrane proteins which have hydrophobic surfaces, are relatively flexible and are expressed at relatively low levels. This creates difficulties in obtaining enough protein and then growing crystals. Hence, despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins, determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins. As of January 2013 less than 0.1% of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20‚Äì30% of the total proteome.Membrane Proteins of known 3D Structure Due to this difficulty and the importance of this class of proteins methods of protein structure prediction based on hydropathy plots, the positive inside rule and other methods have been developed. Thermodynamic stability and folding=Stability of Œ±-helical transmembrane proteins= Transmembrane Œ±-helical proteins are unusually stable judging from thermal denaturation studies, because they do not unfold completely within the membranes (the complete unfolding would require breaking down too many Œ±-helical H-bonds in the nonpolar media). On the other hand, these proteins easily misfold, due to non-native aggregation in membranes, transition to the molten globule states, formation of non-native disulfide bonds, or unfolding of peripheral regions and nonregular loops that are locally less stable. It is also important to properly define the unfolded state. The unfolded state of membrane proteins in detergent micelles is different from that in the thermal denaturation experiments. This state represents a combination of folded hydrophobic Œ±-helices and partially unfolded segments covered by the detergent. For example, the \\"unfolded\\" bacteriorhodopsin in SDS micelles has four transmembrane Œ±-helices folded, while the rest of the protein is situated at the micelle-water interface and can adopt different types of non-native amphiphilic structures. Free energy differences between such detergent-denatured and native states are similar to stabilities of water-soluble proteins (< 10 kcal/mol). =Folding of Œ±-helical transmembrane proteins= Refolding of Œ±-helical transmembrane proteins in vitro is technically difficult. There are relatively few examples of the successful refolding experiments, as for bacteriorhodopsin. In vivo, all such proteins are normally folded co-translationally within the large transmembrane translocon. The translocon channel provides a highly heterogeneous environment for the nascent transmembrane Œ±-helices. A relatively polar amphiphilic Œ±-helix can adopt a transmembrane orientation in the translocon (although it would be at the membrane surface or unfolded in vitro), because its polar residues can face the central water-filled channel of the translocon. Such mechanism is necessary for incorporation of polar Œ±-helices into structures of transmembrane proteins. The amphiphilic helices remain attached to the translocon until the protein is completely synthesized and folded. If the protein remains unfolded and attached to the translocon for too long, it is degraded by specific \\"quality control\\" cellular systems. =Stability and folding of Œ≤-barrel transmembrane proteins= Stability of Œ≤-barrel transmembrane proteins is similar to stability of water-soluble proteins, based on chemical denaturation studies. Some of them are very stable even in chaotropic agents and high temperature. Their folding in vivo is facilitated by water-soluble chaperones, such as protein Skp.

He was the son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea.Antiochus IX Cyzicenus entry in historical sourcebook by Mahlon H. Smith He left the kingdom in 129 BC and went to the city of Cyzicus, but he returned in 116 BC to challenge his half-brother Antiochus VIII for power. The siblings fought a twenty-year civil war. In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC. Biography Bust probably depicting Antiochus IX.ARTHUR HOUGHTON, THE PORTRAIT OF ANTIOCHUS IX [ Antike Kunst, vol 27, issue 2], Vereinigung der Freunde Antiker Kunst, 1984, pp. 123-128. The son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea, upon the death of his father in Parthia and his uncle Demetrius II Nicator's return to power (129 BC), his mother sent him to Cyzicus on the Bosporus, thus giving him his nickname. Following the death of his mother c. 121 BC, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus challenged his half-brother, Antiochus VIII Grypus, for power over Syria. He returned to Syria in 116 BC to claim the Seleucid throne from his half- brother/cousin Antiochus VIII Grypus, with whom he eventually divided Syria, that same year. Antiochus IX Cyzicenus was first married to Cleopatra IV, who was said to have been killed in 112 BC by her sister and rival Tryphaena, wife of King Grypus.Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, 2004Cleopatra Thea by Chris BennettJustin 39, 3, 3-11. After the death of Grypus and Antiochus' capture of the capital, Antiochus married Cleopatra Selene of Syria, the sister of his former wife, Cleopatra IV. He was subsequently killed in battle by the son of Grypus, Seleucus VI Epiphanes, later in 96 BC. Legacy Antiochus IX probably created the Iturean tetrarchy as an ally against Antiochus VIII. Beginning his reign in 95 BC, Antiochus X Eusebes' first achievement was to defeat his double half-cousin/second cousin Seleucus VI Epiphanes, thus avenging the recent death of his father, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. The epithets he took tell much of his story: Eusebes (being a title of his father) and also Philopator (father-loving) both honoured his father. After that, he ruled Antioch and its surroundings, fighting endlessly against the four brothers of Seleucus VI, the Nabataeans and the Parthian Empire.

Biography Just before Antiochus VII Sidetes died fighting the Parthians in late 129, the Parthian king Phraates II had released Demetrius II, who entered Syria in ca. September 129. This forced Seleucus V's half-brother Antiochus IX to flee to Cyzicus. Cleopatra Thea remarried Demetrius and reunited him with his two sons, Seleucus V and Antiochus VIII.Jos.

In the U.S., folk rock emerged from the folk music revival and the influence that the Beatles and other British Invasion bands had on members of that movement. Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds‚Äîseveral of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles‚Äîattempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire, adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community. The term \\"folk rock\\" was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music. The commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and their debut album of the same name, along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation‚Äîon the albums Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965), and Blonde on Blonde (1966)‚Äîencouraged other folk acts, such as Simon & Garfunkel, to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as Buffalo Springfield, to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre. During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle, Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock. Definition and etymology In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term \\"folk rock\\" refers to the blending of elements of folk music and rock music, which arose in the U.S. and UK in the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion bands. The term \\"folk rock\\" was initially coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued. Dylan also contributed to the creation of the genre, with his recordings utilizing rock instrumentation on the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde. In a broader sense, folk rock encompasses similarly inspired musical genres and movements in different regions of the world. Folk rock may lean more towards either folk or rock in instrumentation, playing and vocal style, and choice of material. While the original genre draws on music of Europe and North America, there is no clear delineation of which other culture's music might be included as influences. The term is not typically associated with blues-based rock music, African American music, Cajun-based rock music, nor music with non-European folk roots. There are some exceptions which are mediated through folk revivalists. Antecedents=Folk revival= Pete Seeger entertaining Eleanor Roosevelt (center), at a racially integrated Valentine's Day party.Photograph by Joseph Horne for the Office of War Information, 1944. From the Washington Post, 12 February 1944: \\"The Labor Canteen, sponsored by the United Federal Workers of America, CIO, will be opened at 8 p.m. tomorrow at 1212 18th st. nw. Mrs. Roosevelt is expected to attend at 8:30 p.m.\\" The American folk-music revival began during the 1940s; building on the interest in protest folk singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, it reached a peak in popularity in the mid-1960s with artists such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. In 1948, Seeger formed the Weavers, whose mainstream popularity set the stage for the folk revival of the 1950s and early 1960s and also served to bridge the gap between folk, popular music, and topical song. The Weavers' sound and repertoire of traditional folk material and topical songs directly inspired the Kingston Trio, a three-piece folk group who came to prominence in 1958 with their hit recording of \\"Tom Dooley\\". The Kingston Trio provided the template for a flood of \\"collegiate folk\\" groups between 1958 and 1962. At roughly the same time as these \\"collegiate folk\\" vocal groups came to national prominence, a second group of urban folk revivalists, influenced by the music and guitar picking styles of folk and blues artist such as Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Brownie McGhee, and Josh White, also came to the fore. Many of these urban revivalists were influenced by recordings of traditional American music from the 1920s and 1930s, which had been reissued by Folkways Records; Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music was particularly influential. While this urban folk revival flourished in many cities, New York City, with its burgeoning Greenwich Village coffeehouse scene and population of topical folk singers, was widely regarded as the centre of the movement. Out of this fertile environment came such folk-protest luminaries as Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, and Peter, Paul and Mary, many of whom would transition into folk rock performers as the 1960s progressed. Bob Dylan was the most influential of all the urban folk-protest songwriters. The vast majority of the urban folk revivalists shared a disdain for the values of mainstream American mass culture and led many folk singers to begin composing their own \\"protest\\" material. The influence of this folk-protest movement would later manifest itself in the sociopolitical lyrics and mildly anti-establishment sentiments of many folk rock songs, including hit singles such as \\"Eve of Destruction\\", \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", \\"For What It's Worth\\", and \\"Let's Live for Today\\". During the 1950s and early 1960s in the UK, a parallel folk revival referred to as the second British folk revival, was led by folk singers Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd. Both viewed British folk music as a vehicle for leftist political concepts and an antidote to the American-dominated popular music of the time. However, it wasn't until 1956 and the advent of the skiffle craze that the British folk revival crossed over into the mainstream and connected with British youth culture. Skiffle renewed popularity of folk music forms in Britain and led directly to the progressive folk movement and the attendant British folk club scene. Among the leading lights of the progressive folk movement were Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who would later form the folk rock band Pentangle in the late 1960s. Other notable folk rock artists with roots in the progressive folk scene were Donovan, Al Stewart, John Martyn and Paul Simon. =The Beatles and the British Invasion= Beginning in 1964 and lasting until roughly 1966, a wave of British beat groups, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, Gerry & the Pacemakers, the Kinks, and Herman's Hermits amongst others, dominated the U.S. music charts. These groups were all heavily influenced by American rock 'n' roll, blues, and R&B;‚Äîmusical genres they had been introduced to via homegrown British rock 'n' roll singers, imported American records, and the music of the skiffle craze. These UK groups, known collectively as the British Invasion, reintroduced American youth culture to the broad potential of rock and pop music as a creative medium and to the wealth of musical culture to be found within the United States. Of particular importance to the development of folk rock by the British Invasion were the subtle folk influences evident in such Beatles' compositions as \\"I'll Be Back\\", \\"Things We Said Today\\", and \\"I'm a Loser\\", with the latter song being directly inspired by folk singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the opinion of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, writers who attempt to define the origins of folk rock \\"don't realise that the Beatles were responsible as far back as 1963\\". He cites \\"She Loves You\\" as one of the first examples where the Beatles introduced folk chord changes into rock music and so initiated the new genre. These songs were all influential in providing a template for successfully assimilating folk-based chord progressions and melodies into pop music. This melding of folk and rock 'n' roll in the Beatles' music became even more explicit during 1965, with the release of \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", a folk-derived song with introspective lyrics, again influenced by Dylan. Although the Beatles themselves utilized folk as just one of many styles evident in their music, the underlying folk influences in a number of their songs would prove to be important to folk rock musicians attempting to blend their own folk influences with beat music. The effect that the music of these British bands, and the Beatles in particular, had on young Americans was immediate; almost overnight, folk‚Äîalong with many other forms of homegrown music‚Äîbecame pass√© for a large proportion of America's youth, who instead turned their attention to the influx of British acts. The influence of these acts also impacted on the collegiate folk and urban folk communities, with many young musicians quickly losing interest in folk music and instead embracing the rock 'n' roll derived repertoire of the British Invasion. Future members of many folk rock acts, including the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas, and Buffalo Springfield, all turned their backs on traditional folk music during 1964 and 1965 as a direct result of the influence of the Beatles and the other British Invasion bands. Author and music historian Richie Unterberger has noted that the Beatles' impact on American popular culture effectively sounded the death knell for the American folk music revival. In addition to The Beatles, the two British groups that were arguably the most influential on the development of folk rock were the Animals and the Searchers. The Animals released a rock interpretation of the traditional folk song \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" in the U.S. in August 1964. The song reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and stayed there for three weeks, selling over a million copies in just five weeks in the U.S. The band's arrangement of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\", which transmuted the song from an acoustic folk lament to a full- bore electric rock song, would go on to influence many folk rock acts but none more so than Dylan himself, who cited it as a key factor in his decision to record and perform with an electric rock band in 1965. Electric Twelve- String Guitar in Folk Music The Searchers were influential in popularizing the jangly sound of the electric twelve-string guitar. Many musicians in the collegiate and urban folk movements were already familiar with acoustic twelve-string guitars via the music of folk and blues singer Lead Belly. However, the Searchers' use of amplified twelve-strings provided another example of how conventional folk elements could be incorporated into rock music to produce new and exciting sounds. The Beatles' lead guitarist, George Harrison, also influenced this trend towards jangly guitars in folk rock with his use of a Rickenbacker twelve-string guitar on the Beatles' mid-1960s recordings. This relatively clean, jangly sound‚Äîwithout distortion or other guitar effects‚Äîbecame a cornerstone of folk rock instrumentation and was used in many American folk rock records made during 1965 and 1966. =Other precursors= Although folk rock mainly grew out of a mix of American folk revival and British Invasion influences, there were also a few examples of proto-folk rock that were important in the development of the genre. Of these secondary influences, Unterberger has cited the self-penned, folk-influenced material of San Francisco's the Beau Brummels as arguably the most important. Despite their Beatlesque image, the band's use of minor chords, haunting harmonies, and folky acoustic guitar playing‚Äîas heard on their debut single \\"Laugh, Laugh\\"‚Äîwas stylistically very similar to the later folk rock of the Byrds. Released in December 1964, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1965, while its similarly folk-flavored follow-up, \\"Just a Little\\", did even better, reaching number 8 on the U.S. singles chart. The high-profile success of the Beau Brummels' music was important in demonstrating that a hybrid of folk and rock could potentially be translated into mainstream commercial success. Pre-dating the Beau Brummels' commercial breakthrough by almost two years, singer-songwriter Jackie DeShannon's April 1963 single \\"Needles and Pins\\" marked, according to Unterberger, the earliest appearance of the ringing guitar sound that would become a mainstay of early folk rock. This use of cyclical, chiming guitar riffs was repeated on DeShannon's late 1963 recording of her own composition \\"When You Walk in the Room\\". The following year, both songs would become hits for the Liverpudlian band the Searchers, who chose to place even greater emphasis on the jangly guitar playing in the songs. In addition, a number of DeShannon's songs from the period, including \\"When You Walk in the Room\\", displayed a greater degree of lyrical maturity and sensuality than was usual for pop songs of the time. This heightened degree of emotional introspection was inspired by her love of Bob Dylan's folk songwriting and represents one of the first attempts by an American artist to absorb folk sensibilities into rock music. In the UK, the folk group the Springfields (featuring Dusty Springfield) had been releasing folk-oriented material featuring full band arrangements since the early 1960s, including renditions of \\"Lonesome Traveler\\", \\"Allentown Jail\\", and \\"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\\". Although these records owed more to orchestral pop than rock, they were nonetheless influential on up-and-coming folk rock musicians on both sides of the Atlantic. In mid-1965, folk singer-songwriter Donovan was also experimenting with adding electrified instrumentation to some of his folk and blues-styled material, as evidenced by songs such as \\"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\\" and \\"Sunny Goodge Street\\". In spite of his folky persona and repertoire, Donovan himself had always considered himself a pop star, rather than a folk singer. As a result, he had been thinking of a way in which to introduce folk styled acoustic guitars and socially conscious lyrics into pop music for several years prior to his 1965 breakthrough as a recording artist. By January 1966, he had recorded the self-penned hit \\"Sunshine Superman\\" with a full electric backing band. Other bands and solo artists who were blurring the boundaries between folk and rock in the early 1960s include Judy Henske, Richard and Mimi Fari√±a, and the Mugwumps, the latter of which were a New York band featuring future members of the Lovin' Spoonful and the Mamas & the Papas. Also of note are the Australian band the Seekers, who had relocated to England in 1964 and reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart with \\"I'll Never Find Another You\\" in February 1965. Unterberger has noted that, although it was not strictly a folk song, \\"I'll Never Find Another You\\" was heavily influenced by Peter, Paul and Mary and featured a cyclical, twelve-string guitar part that sounded similar to the guitar style that Jim McGuinn of the Byrds would popularize later that same year. There are also a few antecedents to folk rock present in pre-British Invasion American rock 'n' roll, including Elvis Presley's 1954 cover of the Bill Monroe bluegrass standard \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\"; Buddy Holly's self-penned material, which strongly influenced both Dylan and the Byrds; Ritchie Valens' recording of the Mexican folk song \\"La Bamba\\"; Lloyd Price's rock 'n' roll adaptation of the African-American folk song \\"Stagger Lee\\" (originally recorded by Mississippi John Hurt in 1928); Jimmie Rodgers' rock 'n' roll flavored renditions of traditional folk songs; and the folk and country- influenced recordings featured on the Everly Brothers' 1959 album Songs Our Daddy Taught Us. 1960s=The Byrds= The moment when all of the separate influences that served to make up folk rock finally coalesced into an identifiable whole was with the release of the Byrds' recording of Bob Dylan's \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the band's sound in June 1965, at roughly the same time as \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard chart. Within three months it had become the first folk rock smash hit, reaching number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. The single's success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a profusion of Byrds-influenced acts flooded the American and British charts. In particular, the Byrds' influence can be discerned in mid-1960s recordings by acts such as the Lovin' Spoonful, Barry McGuire, the Mamas & the Papas, Simon & Garfunkel, Jefferson Airplane, the Turtles, We Five, Love, and Sonny & Cher. It was during the rehearsals at World Pacific that the band began to develop the blend of folk music and Beatles-style pop that would characterize their sound. However, this hybrid was not deliberately created; it evolved organically out of some of the band members' own folk music roots and their desire to emulate the Beatles. The band's folk influences, lack of experience with rock music forms, and Beatleseque instrumentation all combined to color both their self-penned material and their folk derived repertoire. The band themselves soon realized that there was something unique about their music and, with Dickson's encouragement, they began to actively attempt to bridge the gap between folk and rock. Mr. Tambourine Man's blend of abstract lyrics, folk-influenced melody, complex harmonies, jangly 12-string Rickenbacker guitar playing, and Beatles-influenced beat, resulted in a synthesis that effectively created the subgenre of folk rock. The song's lyrics alone took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; never before had such intellectual and literary lyrics been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group. Dylan's material would provide much of the original grist for the folk rock mill, not only in the U.S. but in the UK as well, with many pop and rock acts covering his material in a style reminiscent of the Byrds. Their reworking of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", along with the Animals' rock interpretation of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" (itself based on Dylan's earlier cover), helped to give Dylan the impetus to start recording with an electric backing band. As the 1970s dawned, folk rock evolved away from the jangly template pioneered by the Byrds, but their influence could still be heard in the music of bands like Fairport Convention and Pentangle. The Byrds themselves continued to enjoy commercial success with their brand of folk rock throughout 1965, most notably with their number 1 single \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\". By the start of 1966, however, the group had begun to move away from folk rock and into the new musical frontier of psychedelic rock. The folk rock sound of the Byrds has continued to influence many bands over the years, including Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Long Ryders, the Smiths, the Bangles, the Stone Roses, and Teenage Fanclub, among others. =Bob Dylan= Bob Dylan in 1963. Five days before the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record his song \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", Bob Dylan completed the recording sessions for his fifth album, Bringing It All Back Home. Of the eleven tracks on the album, seven featured Dylan backed by a full electric rock band, in stark contrast to his earlier acoustic folk albums. Dylan's decision to record with an electric backing band had been influenced by a number of factors, including the Beatles' coupling of folk derived chord progressions and beat music, the Byrds' rock adaptation of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", and the Animals hit cover of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\". Bringing It All Back Home was released on 22 March 1965, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and #1 on the UK Album Chart. The album's blend of rhythm and blues-derived rock and abstract, poetic lyrics was immediately influential in demonstrating that intelligent lyrical content could be wedded with rock 'n' roll. The songs on the album saw Dylan leaving folk music far behind. Even with this folkier, acoustic material, Dylan's biting, apocalyptical, and often humorous lyrics went far beyond those of contemporary folk music, particularly the folk- protest music with which he had been previously associated. On 20 July 1965, Dylan released the groundbreaking \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", a six-minute-long scathing put-down, directed at a down-and-out society girl, which again featured Dylan backed by an electric rock band. Released just as the Byrds' cover of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" topped the charts in the United States, the song was instrumental in defining the burgeoning folk rock scene and in establishing Dylan as a bona fide rock star, rather than a folksinger. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" managed to reach the Top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic. Five days after the release of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", on 25 July 1965, Dylan made a controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, performing three songs with a full band. He was met with derisive booing and jeering from the festival's purist folk music crowd, but in the years since the incident, Dylan's 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the synthesis of folk and rock. Dylan followed \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" with the wholly electric album Highway 61 Revisited and the non-album single \\"Positively 4th Street\\", which itself has been widely interpreted as a rebuke to the folk purists who had rejected his new electric music. Throughout 1965 and 1966, hit singles like \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", \\"Positively 4th Street\\", and \\"I Want You\\" among others, along with the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde albums, proved to be hugely influential on the development and popularity of folk rock. Although Dylan's move away from acoustic folk music served to outrage and alienate much of his original fanbase, his new folk rock sound gained him legions of new fans during the mid-1960s. The popularity and commercial success of the Byrds and Bob Dylan's blend of folk and rock music influenced a wave of imitators and emulators that retroactively became known as the folk rock boom. =Tom Wilson= Although he started out as a jazz musician, the young, African-American Columbia Records producer Tom Wilson became known as the \\"mid-wife of folk-rock\\" for his seminal work behind the scenes. As Bob Dylan's producer during the key transitional albums The Times They Are A-Changin, Another Side of Bob Dylan, and Bringing It All Back Home, he was a key architect of Dylan's electric sound. He is perhaps even better known, however, for first discovering Simon & Garkfunkel at the tail end of the folk movement and then transforming them into folk-rock superstars with the unauthorized rock remix that made a number one hit out of their previously underappreciated song, \\"The Sound of Silence\\". =Other musicians= Folk rock musicians Simon & Garfunkel performing in Dublin Music critic Richie Unterberger has noted that the commercial success of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", along with Dylan's own contributions to the genre on the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde, initiated an explosion of emulators and imitators. Their success led record producer Tom Wilson to add electric guitar, bass, and drums overdubs to \\"The Sounds of Silence\\", a song which had been recorded by the folk duo Simon & Garfunkel in 1964 and first released on their album Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. The reissued single rose to number 1 on the Billboard pop chart in late 1965, became a hit around the world, and set the duo on one of the most successful careers in pop and rock music. Simon and Garfunkel have been described as \\"folk-rock's greatest duo, and one whose fame and influence would persist well beyond folk-rock's heyday.\\" One of the first bands to craft a distinctly American sound in response to the British Invasion was the Beach Boys; while not a folk rock band themselves, they directly influenced the genre and at the height of the folk rock boom in 1966 had a hit with a cover of the 1920s West Indian folk song \\"Sloop John B\\", which they had learned from the Kingston Trio, who had learned it from the Weavers. Much of the early folk-rock music emerged during a time of general global upheaval, the Vietnam War, and new concerns for the world by young people. In the United States, the heyday of folk rock was arguably between the mid-sixties and the mid-seventies, when it aligned itself with the hippie movement and became an important medium for expressing radical ideas. Cities such as San Francisco, Denver, New York City and Phoenix became centers for the folk rock culture, playing on their central locations among the original folk circuits. The \\"unplugged\\" and simplified sound of the music reflected the genre's connection to a critical view of a technological and consumerist society. Unlike pop music's escapist lyrics, arguably a fantasy distraction from the problems in life, folk artists attempted to communicate concerns for peace, global awareness, and other touchstones of the era. Bands whose music was significantly folk rock in sound during the mid-to-late 1960s included Donovan, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas, the Youngbloods, Love, and, in their early years, Jefferson Airplane. In the mid-1960s, singer- songwriter Gordon Lightfoot began moving his folk songs into a folk-rock direction with recordings such as the percussion-driven \\"Black Day in July\\" about the 1967 Detroit riot. He would rise to top the charts in the 1970s with a number of his folk-rock recordings such as \\"Sundown\\" and \\"Carefree Highway\\" and eventually become known as a folk-rock legend.Concert review: Folk-rock legend Gordon Lightfoot  Dallas Morning News Some artists who originally produced with a harder edged rock sound found the ability to communicate more easily and felt more genuine in this method of delivery. In this category was Cat Stevens, who began in London much like the Byrds did in the United States but toned down the sound more frequently with acoustic instruments. He performed songs that contained concern for the environment, war, and the future of the world in general. The Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell won many Grammy Awards with her folk rock/pop songs. Related movements=Country folk= Merle Haggard and others influenced the sound of artists such as Bob Dylan, Ian and Sylvia, and the Byrds who adopted the sound of country music in the late 1960s. A subgenre originally arising from the early 1960s folk and country-influenced music of singer-songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan and Bobby Bare, as well as from folk revivalist vocal groups like the Kingston Trio. During the late 1960s, many folk rock artists including Dylan, Ian and Sylvia, and the Byrds began to incorporate a strong country influence into their music, drawing heavily on Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens amongst others, resulting in the concurrent offshoot of country rock. This successful blending of country, folk and rock styles led to pioneering country folk records by folk-influenced singer-songwriters such as John Denver and Neil Young during the 1970s. Country folk music usually displays a softer, more \\"laid-back\\" feel than the majority of country music and is often complemented by introspective lyrics, thus preserving its folk singer-songwriter roots. Since the 1970s, the country folk subgenre has been perpetuated by artists including John Prine, Nanci Griffith, Kathy Mattea, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Iris DeMent. =Celtic rock= A subgenre of folk rock that combines traditional Celtic instrumentation with rock rhythms, often influenced by a wide variety of pop and rock music styles. It emerged from the electric folk music of the late 1960s and was pioneered by bands such as Horslips, who blended Gaelic mythology, traditional Irish music and rock. The British singer-songwriter Donovan was also influential in developing Celtic rock during the late 1960s, with his albums The Hurdy Gurdy Man, Barabajagal, and Open Road, the latter of which actually featured a song entitled \\"Celtic Rock\\". The subgenre was further popularised in 1973 by Thin Lizzy, who had a hit with \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\", a traditional Irish song performed entirely in the rock idiom. Throughout the 1970s, Celtic rock held close to its folk roots, drawing heavily on traditional Celtic fiddle, pipe, and harp tunes, as well as traditional vocal styles, but making use of rock band levels of amplification and percussion. In the 1980s and beyond, Celtic rock was perpetuated by bands such as the Pogues, the Waterboys, Runrig, Black 47, and the Prodigals. A more recent folk rock band based in England is the BibleCode Sundays. Celtic rock is also popular in Spain where bands such as Celtas Cortos have had a large following since the early 1990s. =Medieval folk rock= John Renbourn in 2005 Medieval folk rock developed as a subgenre of electric folk from about 1970 as performers, particularly in England, Germany and Brittany, adopted medieval and renaissance music as a basis for their music, in contrast to the early modern and nineteenth century ballads that dominated the output of Fairport Convention. This followed the trend explored by Steeleye Span, and exemplified by their 1972 album Below the Salt. Acts in this area included Gryphon, Gentle Giant and Third Ear Band.E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 135. In Germany Ougenweide, originally formed in 1970 as an acoustic folk group, opted to draw exclusively on High German medieval music when they electrified, setting the agenda for future German electric folk.S. Winick, Dirty Linen, 128 (February/March 2007). In Brittany, as part of the Celtic rock movement, medieval music was focused on by bands like Ripaille from 1977 and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock from 1979.D. E. Asbj√∏rnsen, Scented Gardens of the Mind, http://sgm.paullee.ru/sgm-fr.htm, retrieved 29 January 2009. However, by the end of the 1970s almost all of these performers had either disbanded or moved, like Gentle Giant and Gryphon, into the developing area of progressive rock.C. Snider, The Strawberry Bricks Guide to Progressive Rock (Lulu.com, 2008), pp. 183‚Äì4. In the 1990s, as part of the wider resurgence of folk music in general, new medieval folk rock acts began to appear, including the Ritchie Blackmore project Blackmore's Night, German bands such as In Extremo, Subway to Sally or Schandmaul and English bands like Circulus.Dave Simpson, \\"Boogie knights\\", The Guardian (London), 29 June 2006, retrieved 22 January 2009. =Progressive folk rock= In Britain the tendency to electrify brought several progressive folk acts into rock.E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 134‚Äì5. This includes the acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, who became the electric combo T. Rex.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 40. Others, probably influenced by the electric folk pioneered by Fairport Convention from 1969, moved towards more traditional material, a category including Dando Shaft, Amazing Blondel, and Jack the Lad, an offshoot of northern progressive folk group Lindisfarne, who were one of the most successful UK bands of the early 1970s.N. Talevski, Rock Obituaries - Knocking on Heaven's Door, (Omnibus Press, April 2010) p.289 Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock were the short lived (but later reunited) Comus and, more successfully, Renaissance, who combined folk and rock with elements of classical music.Renaissance biography Allmusic.com. Retrieved 28 January 2014 =Folk metal= Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock. The earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England and Cruachan from Ireland. Skyclad's debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1991 and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachan's early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow. The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with fantasy, mythology, paganism, history and nature. Regional varieties=British folk rock= Simon Nicol and Ric Sanders of Fairport Convention performing at Fairport's Cropredy Convention 2005 British folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle. It uses traditional British music and self-penned compositions in a traditional style, and is played on a combination of traditional and rock instruments. This incorporation of traditional British folk music influences gives British folk rock its distinctly British character and flavour. It evolved out of the psychedelia-influenced folk rock of British acts such as Donovan, the Incredible String Band, and Tyrannosaurus Rex, but was also heavily influenced by such American folk rock bands as the Byrds, Love, and Buffalo Springfield. British folk rock was at its most significant and popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, when, in addition to Fairport and Pentangle, it was taken up by groups such as Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. Steeleye Span, founded by Fairport Convention bass player Ashley Hutchings, was made up of traditionalist folk musicians who wished to incorporate electrical amplification, and later overt rock elements, into their music. This, in turn, spawned the conspicuously English folk rock music of the Albion Band, a group that also included Hutchings. In Brittany folk rock was developed by Alan Stivell (who began to mix his Breton, Irish, and Scottish roots with rock music) and later by French bands like Malicorne. During this same period, folk rock was adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives. Folk rock also gave rise to the subgenre of Medieval folk rock and the fusion genres of folk punk and folk metal. By the 1980s the popularity of British folk rock was in steep decline but it has survived into the 21st century and has been revived as part of a more general folk resurgence since the 1990s. British folk music has also been influential in those parts of the world with close cultural connections to Britain, such as the U.S. and Canada. =Central Europe and the Balkans=Hungary In Hungary the fusion of rock and folk music began in 1965, when the band Ill√©s introduced Hungarian folk music elements into their beat-influenced music, winning everything which could be won in that time at festivals, TV contests, etc. Their rock-musical Istv√°n, a kir√°ly (Stephen I of Hungary), released in 1980 contains strong folk-influences and traditional folk songs as well. The film made based on the rock-opera was one of the biggest box-office hits in 1980. Later on bands like Barbaro, G√©pfolkl√≥r, Kormor√°n and Drums have developed a distinctive sound using odd rhythms, progressive rock, Hungarian and Greek/Bulgarian/etc. folk traditions. Psychedelic Galloping Wonder Stag (2005-) continues Galloping Coroners' shaman punk with acoustic, folk-instrumented, extatic sound moving closer to original shamanic folk music. Romania In Romania Transsylvania Phoenix (known in Romania simply as Phoenix), founded in 1962, introduced significant folk elements into their rock music around 1972 in an unsuccessful attempt to compromise with government repression of rock music. The attempt failed, and they ended up in exile during much of the Ceau≈üescu era, but much of their music still retains a folk rock sound. The present-day bands Spitalul de Urgen≈£ƒÉ (Romanian) and Zdob ≈üi Zdub (Moldova) also both merge folk and rock. Yugoslavia and its successor states YU Grupa performing in 2007 Although large number of Yugoslav 1960s beat bands performed and recorded covers of Balkan traditional songs, it was the late 1960s and early 1970s when the Yugoslav rock bands started incorporating folk elements into their own compositions. Progressive rock bands Korni Grupa and YU Grupa and acoustic rock band S Vremena Na Vreme were pioneers in incorporating folk music elements into their sound, and were followed by progressive rock bands Smak and Dah, acoustic rock bands DAG, Suncokret and Rezonansa, and jazz fusion bands Leb i Sol and Den Za Den. Bijelo Dugme, which emerged in the mid-1970s, had huge success with their folk-influenced hard rock sound, becoming the most popular Yugoslav band, managing to sustain this status during the 1980s. However, at the beginning of the 1980s, Bijelo Dugme switched to new wave, and in the late 1980s to pop rock, but their last few releases also featured folk music elements. Late Bijelo Dugme albums influenced a number of pop rock/folk rock bands, mostly from Sarajevo: Crvena Jabuka, Plavi Orkestar, Merlin, Valentino, Hari Mata Hari, Jugosloveni. Several hard rock and heavy metal bands, like Vatreni Poljubac and Griva, incorporated folk music elements into their songs. The singer-songwriter ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá incorporated elements of folk music of Vojvodina into a number of his songs, while some of his albums, like Na posletku... and Rani mraz, were completely folk rock-oriented. Another notable act whose music featured a combination of rock and Vojvodina folk music were the band Garavi Sokak. The band Galija incorporated some folk music elements into their music during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and in 1999 released the album Ju≈ænjaƒçka uteha with covers of Serbian traditional songs. The band Azra started their career as a new wave band, but in their late period started to incorporate folk music elements into their music. After the band disbanded, the band's former leader, Branimir ≈†tuliƒá continued to use folk music elements on his solo albums, often recording covers of traditional songs. In the early 1990s, Serbian band Orthodox Celts emerged. They saw major success with their Irish folk/Celtic rock sound, influencing a number of younger bands, most notably Tir na n'Og and Irish Stew of Sindidun.\\"Aca Celtic (Orthodox Celts): Spremamo album nabijen emocijama\\", balkanrock.com =The Soviet Union and its successor states= Hellawes from \\"Melnitsa\\" Russian folk rock artists combine elements of Russian rock with celtic music, folk music of Northern countries as well as Russian folk music. Examples are the band Yat-Kha and Sak-Sok, who perform Tuvan and Tatar traditional music based on rock music. The first known fusions between rock music and folklore in Russia began with bands of the VIA generation till the end of the 1960s and the early 1970s, such as Pesniary and Ariel. The songs by the 1975 student ensemble \\"Ornament\\" are based on Anglo- American folk music. The group later renamed to Kukuruza and performed from 1986 on as a professional band. The band Kalinov Most was formed that year, releasing their debut album, Vyvoroten, in 1990, which contained \\"ethnical motiefs and shamanic motets\\". Numerous bands and musicians have cited this band as an influence, most notably Inna Zhelannaya and the band \\"Dvurechye\\". Less-known bands, such as \\"Ado\\", performed in the style of folk and country rock. The first half of the 1990s saw diverse groups such as \\"Sektor Gaza\\", \\"Ckazy Lesa\\" (formerly known as \\"Huligany\\"), \\"Rada i Ternovnik\\", \\"Ad Libitum\\" and \\"Bashnaya Rowan\\". Musicians of these groups incorporate, beside folk rock, several different genres, ranging from psychedelic music to Jazz and neo-folk. Sergey Kalugin's 1994 EP Nigredo became Russia's first dark folk album. Members of the folk rock band \\"Til Ulenshpigel\\", formed in 1996, later invited the singer Hellawes to join the band. After the break-up of \\"Til Ulenshpigel\\" in 1999, Hellawes joined the band Melnitsa, replacing founding member Ruslana Komlyakova. Around the time, in 1999, the band \\"Veter Vody\\" was formed, including Den Skurida and Maria Larina from Til Ulenshpigel. Despite their separation from Melnitsa in 2002, the latter band is still one of the most famous folk rock bands in Russia. One of the most popular and successful folk rock bands in Ukraine are \\"Dorogi Menyayut Tsvet\\", which received a Ukrainian Rock Award for the \\"Best Folk-Rock Group in Ukraine\\" in 2006. =Turkey= Turkey, during the 1970s and 1980s, also sustained a vibrant folk rock scene, drawing inspirations from diverse ethnic elements of Anatolia, the Balkans, Eurasia and the Black Sea region and thriving in a culture of intense political strife, with musicians in nationalist and Marxist camps. Leading examples are Cem Karaca, Kazƒ±m Koyuncu, Barƒ±≈ü Man√ßo, Erkin Koray, Fikret Kƒ±zƒ±lok, Sil√ºetler, Moƒüollar and left-wing Grup Yorum. =Germany= There is a large and diversified folk-rock scene in Germany. The scene is closely, but not solely, connected with the medieval festivals, which for more than 20 years has been kept all over Germany often in old castles (e.g. Veldenburger Festival). The largest of these is spectaculum. The music realizes all kinds of mixtures between folk and rock. There are bands such as Die Streuner whose music is close to medieval music, but there are more bands whose music, though it is close to medieval music, use rock drums and rock-like rhythms and are more or less electrified (Vermaledyit, Feuerschwanz, Saltatio Mortis, Corvus Corax). Many bands plays even more rock-like folk-rock (Schandmaul, Faun, Ignis Fatuu) although Faun is hard to classify due to musice variation. Some bands play medieval metal (Tanzwut, In Extremo, Subway to Sally, Rabenschrei). Use of older instruments is common in German folk-rock. The most widely used old instruments in the German folk-rock are perhaps bagpipes, pipes, hurdy- gurdy, nyckelharp, and lute, which often are played together with rock guitar, bass and drums. Tanzwut and In Extremo have for instance two bagpipes players in their heavyband. The German folk-rock scene is largely based on professional musicians, including a number of female multi-instrumental musicians such as Anna Kr√§nzlein (Schandmaul) and Fiona R√ºggeberg (Faun). The inspiration of the German folk-rock does not stem from old German music only, but from a variety of other sources such as France, Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and Sweden. Faun has introduced music from even a wider range of countries. Some German folk-rock bands play Scottish and Irish folk-rock, like The Dolmen and Fiddlers Green (folk-punk). German folk-rock has nothing to do with Schlagers music or traditional brass band music. =Italy and Spain=Italy It is difficult to define the boundaries between folk and ethnic music in Italy, because of its geographic position and its history. The folk side was founded by the Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare at the end of the 1960s. The Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano was characterized by musical search and a strong political commitment. In Italy many songwriters imported American models, such as Folk beat n. 1 by Francesco Guccini or to Edoardo Bennato, who mixes country, rock and tarantella. The Modena City Ramblers, in 2009 Combining genres and performing Celtic patchanka Folk rock roots can be found in two Italian songwriters: Fabrizio De Andr√© and Angelo Branduardi. In 1984, Fabrizio De Andr√© published the LP Creuza de ma, in Genoese dialect. De Andr√© used musical instruments from Bosporus to Gibraltar: oud, Andalusian guitar, Macedonian bag pipe, flute, Turkish , lute, Greek bouzuki and neapolitan mandolin. Branduardi is a classical musician whose first LP Branduardi '74 is near to progressive sound, later he approaches to medieval and rinascimental and Celtic music. In 1985 he sang William Butler Yeats poetry. The violin, the harp, the sitar, the banjo and the lute are accompanied by electric bass and drums. Later he substituted violin with electric violin. In 1982 Lou Dalfin formed an Occitan group which performed traditional music with traditional instruments: ghironda, accordion and organetto, violin, flute, boha and bag pipe, with singing in the Occitan language. A new line-up of the band in 1990 played folk, jazz and rock using electric bass, drums, electric guitar, keyboard and saxophone. In 1988 Gigi Camedda, Gino Marielli and Andrea Parodi founded Tazenda, an Italian ethno-folk-rock group which uses a launeddas (the oldest reed instruments of the Mediterranean), the sampled \\"canti a tenore\\", the diatonic accordions are mixed with electric guitars and drums and harmonicas. The Gang were formed in 1984 as a punk group, inspired by The Clash, but in 1990 they began to sing about the Italian political and social situation and they moved away from punk-style electric guitar and used acoustic twelve string guitar, violin, accordion, harmonica, and flutes. In 2004, after two rock discs, Gang recorded Nel tempo e oltre cantando insieme with La Macina, a band of musical search from Marche led by Gastone Pietrucci. Traditional songs and Gang's songs were revised rearranged: an example of fusion between rock and popular tradition. In 1991 some performers from Emilia-Romagna founded Modena City Ramblers, which blends the Combat Rock musical style (The Clash) with folk, traditional Irish music, political songs (Contessa) and partisans' songs (Fischia il vento and Bella Ciao). Later M.C.R. used a world music sound and blended in rock, punk, tape loops and samples, creating a new genre called Celtic patchanka. Many groups were influenced by M.C.R.: Casa del Vento, Fiamma Fumana led by Alberto Cottica (electronic folk); Caravane de Ville of Giovanni Rubbiani; Ductia of Massimo Giuntini; Paulem and La strana famiglia led by Luciano Gaetani; and Cisco (former singer of M.C.R.) now a guitarist and drummer. Spain Susana Seivane on stage at Lorient, Brittany, in 2004 Other fusions of folk and rock include New Flamenco (Spain), the pop-oriented forms of North African ra√Ø music. Spain has produced two folk-rock-bagpipers, Susana Seivane from Galicia and Hevia, who mix traditional with modern dance tunes. Triquel is another Spanish Celtic rock band that combines rock music with Celtic folk roots whereas M√§go de Oz is a well known Spanish band which combines Celtic folk rock with hard rock. Experimental rock musician Lynda Thomas also became well- known for the fusion of traditional music with rock or eurodance music. =Outside Europe=Canada Canadian folk rock is particularly, although not exclusively, associated with Celtic folk traditions. Bands such as Figgy Duff, Wonderful Grand Band and Spirit of the West were early pioneers in the Canadian tradition of Celtic-influenced rock, and were later followed by acts such as Crash Test Dummies, Great Big Sea, the Mahones, the Dukhs, Jimmy George, Rawlins Cross, Captain Tractor, Mudmen, and Michou. In recent years, a variety of Canadian indie music has reached the scene with varying styles of folk rock such as Attack in Black, Great Lake Swimmers, City and Colour, The Wooden Sky, Joel Plaskett and Two Hours Traffic. Australia Australia has a unique tradition of folk music, with origins in both the indigenous music traditions of the original Australian inhabitants, as well as the introduced folk music (including sea shanties) of 18th and 19th century Europe. Celtic, English, German and Scandinavian folk traditions predominated in this first wave of European immigrant music. The Australian tradition is, in this sense, related to the traditions of other countries with similar ethnic, historical and political origins, such as New Zealand, Canada, and the USA. The Australian indigenous tradition brought to this mix novel elements, including new instruments, some of which are now internationally familiar, such as the digeridoo of Northern Australia. Notable Australian exponents of the folk revival movement included both European immigrants such as Eric Bogle, and indigenous Australians like Archie Roach, and many others. In the 1970s, Australian folk rock brought both familiar and less familiar traditional songs, as well as new compositions, to live venues and the airwaves. Notable artists include The Bushwacker Band and Redgum. The 1990s brought Australian Indigenous Folk Rock to the world, led by bands including Yothu Yindi. Australia's long and continuous folk tradition continues strongly to this day, with elements of folk music still present in many contemporary artists including those generally thought of as rock, heavy metal and alternative rock. East Asia In Japan in the 1960s with the Eleki Boom brought about by The Ventures and The Astronauts touring in the country, bands such as Takeshi Terauchi & Blue Jeans, Off Course, The Spacemen, and Munetaka Inoue & Sharp Five combined Japanese folk music with surf rock and instrumental rock, often doing instrumental rock renditions of Japanese folk songs. Manila Sound is a subgenre popular in the Philippines (notably in Manila during the 1970s which combined elements of Filipino folk music, rock and roll, jazz and disco. Notable musicians in this genre include Freddie Aguilar, Florante, Heber Bartolome and Banyuhay, Asin, Sampaguita, Rey Valera, Sharon Cuneta, Hotdog, the APO Hiking Society, VST & Co., Rico J. Puno, and Ryan Cayabyab, although only Aguilar's, Florante's, Bartolome's, Asin's and Sampaguita's music can be considered folk rock, with the others' more aptly under the folk pop or simply pop rubric. = South Africa = Belgian-born South African Rock-singer Karen Zoid made headlines when her debut single Afrikaners is Plesierig (Afrikaans people are Fun) became a hit in 2001. The song is a slightly altered bilingual rock-version of the Afrikaans folk-song of the same name. It also inadvertently kick-started the Afrikaans Rock movement.

In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an \\"intelligence\\" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data. Among myriad uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments, and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts. Chugh, R & Grandhi, S 2013, ‚ÄòWhy Business Intelligence? Significance of Business Intelligence tools and integrating BI governance with corporate governance‚Äô, International Journal of E-Entrepreneurship and Innovation, vol. 4, no.2, pp. 1-14. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273861123_Why_Business_Intelligence_Significance_of_Business_Intelligence_Tools_and_Integrating_BI_Governance_with_Corporate_Governance BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as \\"BI/DW\\" or as \\"BIDW\\". A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitate decision support. History The earliest known use of the term business intelligence is in Richard Millar Devens' Cyclop√¶dia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker Sir Henry Furnese gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors: The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence. When Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher at IBM, used the term business intelligence in an article published in 1958, he employed the Webster's Dictionary definition of intelligence: \\"the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal.\\" Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the decision support systems (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s. DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with decision making and planning. In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a Gartner analyst) proposed business intelligence as an umbrella term to describe \\"concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems.\\" It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread. Critics see BI merely as an evolution of business reporting together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use data analysis tools. In this respect it has also been criticized as a marketing buzzword in the context of the \\"big data\\" surge. Definition According to Solomon Negash and Paul Gray, business intelligence (BI) can be defined as systems that combine: *Data gathering *Data storage *Knowledge management with analysis to evaluate complex corporate and competitive information for presentation to planners and decision makers, with the objective of improving the timeliness and the quality of the input to the decision process.\\" According to Forrester Research, business intelligence is \\"a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making.\\" Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses information management (data integration, data quality, data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to data preparation and data usage as two separate but closely linked segments of the business- intelligence architectural stack. Some elements of business intelligence are: * Multidimensional aggregation and allocation * Denormalization, tagging, and standardization * Realtime reporting with analytical alert * A method of interfacing with unstructured data sources * Group consolidation, budgeting, and rolling forecasts * Statistical inference and probabilistic simulation * Key performance indicators optimization * Version control and process management * Open item management Forrester distinguishes this from the business-intelligence market, which is \\"just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as reporting, analytics, and dashboards.\\" =Compared with competitive intelligence= Though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for competitive intelligence (because they both support decision making), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes, and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence. =Compared with business analytics= Business intelligence and business analytics are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions. Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that business intelligence should be divided into querying, reporting, Online analytical processing (OLAP), an \\"alerts\\" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality. Data Business operations can generate a very large amount of data in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to Merrill Lynch, more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time. Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either unstructured or semi- structured. The management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry. According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30‚Äì40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision-making. Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding, and assessing unstructured or semi- structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task, or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision-making. Therefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data. =Unstructured data vs. semi- structured data= Unstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered columns and rows. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a BLOB (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most relational database management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated column patterns that vary from row to row or files of natural language that do not have detailed metadata. Many of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PDFs, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database. Therefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data, but no specific consensus seems to have been reached. Unstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution. =Limitations of semi- structured and unstructured data= There are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon & Nesavich,Inmon, B. & A. Nesavich, \\"Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization\\" from \\"Managing Unstructured data in the organization\\", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1‚Äì13 some of those are: * Physically accessing unstructured textual data ‚Äì unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats. * Terminology ‚Äì Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology. * Volume of data ‚Äì As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis. * Searchability of unstructured textual data ‚Äì A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon & Nesavich, 2008) gives an example: ‚Äúa search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.‚Äù =Metadata= To solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of metadata. Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content ‚Äì e.g. summaries, topics, people, or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and information extraction. Applications Business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes: * Performance metrics and benchmarking inform business leaders of progress towards business goals (business process management). * Analytics quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve data mining, process mining, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, predictive modeling, business process modeling, data lineage, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics. * Business reporting can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve dashboards, data visualization, executive information system, and/or OLAP * BI can facilitate collaboration both inside and outside the business by enabling data sharing and electronic data interchange * Knowledge management is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general. Knowledge management leads to learning management and regulatory compliance. Marketplace In a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent \\"pure-play\\" vendor or a consolidated \\"megavendor\\". In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue. In 2019, the BI market was shaken within Europe for the new legislation of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) which puts the responsibility of data collection and storage onto the data user with strict laws in place to make sure the data is compliant. Growth within Europe has steadily increased since May 2019 when GDPR was brought. The legislation refocused companies to look at their own data from a compliance perspective but also revealed future opportunity using personalization and external BI providers to increase market share.SaaS BI growth will soar in 2010  Cloud Computing.

This derivative of benzene is a colorless oily liquid, although aged samples can appear yellowish. The compound evaporates easily and has a sweet smell, although high concentrations have a less pleasant odor. Styrene is the precursor to polystyrene and several copolymers. Approximately 25 million tonnes of styrene were produced in 2010, increasing to around 35 million tonnes by 2018. Natural occurrence Styrene is named after storax balsam, the resin of Liquidambar trees of the Altingiaceae plant family. Styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods (cinnamon, coffee beans, balsam trees and peanuts) and is also found in coal tar. History In 1839, the German apothecary Eduard Simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin (called storax or styrax (Latin)) of the American sweetgum tree (Liquidambar styraciflua). He called the liquid \\"styrol\\" (now styrene).Simon, E. (1839) \\"Ueber den fl√ºssigen Storax (Styrax liquidus)\\" (On liquid storax (Styrax liquidus), Annalen der Chemie, 31 : 265‚Äì277. From p. 268: \\"Das fl√ºchtige Oel, f√ºr welches ich den Namen Styrol vorschlage, ‚Ä¶ \\" (The volatile oil, for which I suggest the name \\"styrol\\", ‚Ä¶ )For further details of the history of styrene, see: F. W. Semmler, Die √§therischen √ñle nach ihren chemischen Bestandteilen unter Ber√ºcksichtigung der geschichtlichen Entwicklung [The volatile liquids according to their chemical components with regard to historical development], vol. 4 (Leipzig, Germany, Veit & Co., 1907), ¬ß 327. Styrol, pp. 24-28. He also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air, light, or heat, it gradually transformed into a hard, rubber-like substance, which he called \\"styrol oxide\\".(Simon, 1839), p. 268. From p. 268: \\"F√ºr den festen R√ºckstand w√ºrde der Name Styroloxyd passen.\\" (For the solid residue, the name \\"styrol oxide\\" would fit.) By 1845, the German chemist August Hofmann and his student John Blyth had determined styrene's empirical formula: C8H8.See: * ; see p. 339. * Reprinted in: ; see p. 102. * German translation: ; see p. 297. * Note that Blyth and Hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as C16H8 because at that time, some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). They had also determined that Simon's \\"styrol oxide\\" ‚Äì which they renamed \\"metastyrol\\" ‚Äì had the same empirical formula as styrene.(Blyth and Hofmann, 1845a), p. 348. From p. 348: \\"Analysis as well as synthesis has equally proved that styrol and the vitreous mass (for which we propose the name of metastyrol) possess the same constitution per cent.\\" Furthermore, they could obtain styrene by dry- distilling \\"metastyrol\\".(Blyth and Hofmann, 1845a), p. 350. In 1865, the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer found that styrene could form a dimer,Erlenmeyer, Emil (1865) \\"Ueber Distyrol, ein neues Polymere des Styrols\\" (On distyrol, a new polymer of styrol), Annalen der Chemie, 135 : 122‚Äì123. and in 1866 the French chemist Marcelin Berthelot stated that \\"metastyrol\\" was a polymer of styrene (i.e. polystyrene).Berthelot, M. (1866) \\"Sur les caract√®res de la benzine et du styrol√®ne, compar√©s avec ceux des autres carbures d'hydrog√®ne\\" (On the characters of benzene and styrene, compared with those of other hydrocarbons), Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Chimique de Paris, 2nd series, 6 : 289‚Äì298. From p. 294: \\"On sait que le styrol√®ne chauff√© en vase scell√© √† 200¬∞, pendant quelques heures, se change en un polym√®re r√©sineux (m√©tastyrol), et que ce polym√®re, distill√© brusquement, reproduit le styrol√®ne.\\" (One knows that styrene [when] heated in a sealed vessel at 200 ¬∞C, for several hours, is changed into a resinous polymer (metastyrol), and that this polymer, [when] distilled abruptly, reproduces styrene.) Meanwhile, other chemists had been investigating another component of storax, namely, cinnamic acid. They had found that cinnamic acid could be decarboxylated to form \\"cinnamene\\" (or \\"cinnamol\\"), which appeared to be styrene. In 1845, French chemist Emil Kopp suggested that the two compounds were identical,Kopp, E. (1845), \\"Recherches sur l'acide cinnamique et sur le cinnam√®ne\\" (Investigations of cinnamic acid and cinnamen), Comptes rendus, 21 : 1376‚Äì1380. From p. 1380: \\"Je pense qu'il faudra d√©sormais remplacer le mot de styrol par celui de cinnam√®ne, et le m√©tastyrol par le m√©tacinnam√®ne.\\" (I think that henceforth one will have to replace the word \\"styrol\\" with that of \\"cinnam√®ne\\", and \\"metastyrol\\" with \\"metacinnam√®ne\\".) and in 1866, Erlenmeyer suggested that both \\"cinnamol\\" and styrene might be vinylbenzene.Erlenmeyer, Emil (1866) \\"Studien √ºber die s.g. aromatischen S√§uren\\" (Studies of the so-called aromatic acids), Annalen der Chemie, 137 : 327‚Äì359; see p. 353. However, the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin: the latter was optically active. From p. 160: \\"1¬∞ Le carbure des cinnamates est priv√© de pouvoir rotatoire, tandis que le carbure du styrax d√©vie de 3 degr√©s la teinte de passage (l = 100 mm).\\" (1. The carbon [atom] of cinnamates is bereft of rotary power [i.e., the ability to rotate polarized light], whereas the carbon of styrax deflects by 3 degrees the neutral tint [i.e., the relative orientation of the polarized quartz plates at which the light through the polarimeter appears colorless] (length = 100 mm). [For further details about 19th century polarimeters, see: ]) Eventually, in 1876, the Dutch chemist van 't Hoff resolved the ambiguity: the optical activity of the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin was due to a contaminant.van 't Hoff, J. H. (1876) \\"Die Identit√§t von Styrol und Cinnamol, ein neuer K√∂rper aus Styrax\\" (The identity of styrol and cinnamol, a new substance from styrax), Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, 9 : 5-6. Industrial production=From ethylbenzene= The vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene, and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production. As such, the two production processes are often highly integrated. Ethylbenzene is produced via a Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction between benzene and ethylene; originally this used aluminum chloride as a catalyst, but in modern production this has been replaced by zeolites. By dehydrogenation Around 80% of styrene is produced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. This is achieved using superheated steam (up to 600 ¬∞C) over an iron(III) oxide catalyst. The reaction is highly endothermic and reversible, with a typical yield of 88‚Äì94%. :500px The crude ethylbenzene/styrene product is then purified by distillation. As the difference in boiling points between the two compounds is only 9 ¬∞C at ambient pressure this necessitates the use of a series of distillation columns. This is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene, requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system. Via ethylbenzene hydroperoxide Styrene is also co-produced commercially in a process known as POSM (Lyondell Chemical Company) or SM/PO (Shell) for styrene monomer / propylene oxide. In this process, ethylbenzene is treated with oxygen to form the ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. This hydroperoxide is then used to oxidize propylene to propylene oxide, which is also recovered as a co-product. The remaining 1-phenylethanol is dehydrated to give styrene: : Synthesis of styrene =Other industrial routes= Pyrolysis gasoline extraction  Extraction from pyrolysis gasoline is performed on a limited scale.  From toluene and methanol  Styrene can be produced from toluene and methanol, which are cheaper raw materials than those in the conventional process. This process has suffered from low selectivity associated with the competing decomposition of methanol. Exelus Inc. claims to have developed this process with commercially viable selectivities, at 400‚Äì425 ¬∞C and atmospheric pressure, by forcing these components through a proprietary zeolitic catalyst. It is reported that an approximately 9:1 mixture of styrene and ethylbenzene is obtained, with a total styrene yield of over 60%.Stephen K. Ritter, Chemical & Engineering News, 19 March 2007, p.46. From benzene and ethane Another route to styrene involves the reaction of benzene and ethane. This process is being developed by Snamprogetti and Dow. Ethane, along with ethylbenzene, is fed to a dehydrogenation reactor with a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing styrene and ethylene. The dehydrogenation effluent is cooled and separated and the ethylene stream is recycled to the alkylation unit. The process attempts to overcome previous shortcomings in earlier attempts to develop production of styrene from ethane and benzene, such as inefficient recovery of aromatics, production of high levels of heavies and tars, and inefficient separation of hydrogen and ethane. Development of the process is ongoing.  Laboratory synthesis  A laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid: :C6H5CH=CHCO2H ‚Üí C6H5CH=CH2 \\\\+ CO2 Styrene was first prepared by this method.R. Fittig und F. Binder \\"Ueber die Additionsproducte der Zimmtssaure\\" in \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die unges√§ttigten S√§uren. I. Weitere Beitr√§ge zur Kenntni√ü der Fumars√§ure und Male√Øns√§ure\\" Rudolph Fittig, Camille Petri, Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie 1879, volume 195, pp. 56‚Äì179. Polymerization The presence of the vinyl group allows styrene to polymerize. Commercially significant products include polystyrene, ABS, styrene-butadiene (SBR) rubber, styrene-butadiene latex, SIS (styrene- isoprene-styrene), S-EB-S (styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene), styrene- divinylbenzene (S-DVB), styrene-acrylonitrile resin (SAN), and unsaturated polyesters used in resins and thermosetting compounds. These materials are used in rubber, plastic, insulation, fiberglass, pipes, automobile and boat parts, food containers, and carpet backing. Hazards= Explosive autopolymerisation = Styrene will polymerise spontaneously to polystyrene, without the need of external initiators. This is known as autopolymerisation, and will take place at ambient temperatures and above. At 100 ¬∞C it will polymerise at a rate of ~2% per hour, and more rapidly than this at higher temperatures. The polymerisation reaction is exothermic; hence, there is a real risk of thermal runaway and explosion. An example is the 2019 explosion of the tanker Stolt Groenland; in this incident 5,250 metric tons of styrene monomer detonated while the ship was docked in Ulsan, Republic of Korea. The autopolymerisation reaction can only be kept in check by the continuous addition of polymerisation inhibitors. = Health effects = Styrene is regarded as a \\"known carcinogen\\", especially in case of eye contact, but also in case of skin contact, of ingestion and of inhalation, according to several sources. Styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans, resulting from oxidation by cytochrome P450. Styrene oxide is considered toxic, mutagenic, and possibly carcinogenic. Styrene oxide is subsequently hydrolyzed in vivo to styrene glycol by the enzyme epoxide hydrolase. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has described styrene to be \\"a suspected toxin to the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and respiratory system, among others\\". On 10 June 2011, the U.S. National Toxicology Program has described styrene as \\"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\\". However, a STATS author describes a review that was done on scientific literature and concluded that \\"The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between styrene exposure and any type of human cancer\\".Boffetta, P., et al., Epidemiologic Studies of Styrene and Cancer: A Review of the Literature , J. Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Nov.2009, V.51, N.11. Despite this claim, work has been done by Danish researchers to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and cancer. They concluded, \\"The findings have to be interpreted with caution, due to the company based exposure assessment, but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry, mainly styrene, and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer, deserves attention\\". In 2012, the Danish EPA concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene.Danish EPA 2011 review The U.S. EPA does not have a cancer classification for styrene, US environmental protection agency. Section I.B.4 relates to neurotoxicology. but it has been the subject of their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. The National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has determined that styrene is \\"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\\". Various regulatory bodies refer to styrene, in various contexts, as a possible or potential human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer considers styrene to be \\"probably carcinogenic to humans\\". The neurotoxic properties of styrene have also been studied and reported effects include effects on vision (although unable to reproduce in a subsequent study) and on hearing functions. Studies on rats have yielded contradictory results, but epidemiologic studies have observed a synergistic interaction with noise in causing hearing difficulties. = Industrial accident = On 7 May 2020, a gas, reported to be styrene, leaked from a tank at the LG Chem (LG Polymers India Private Limited) plant at RR Venkatapuram, Visakhapatnam, Andra Pradesh, India. The leak occurred in the early morning hours while workers were preparing to reopen the plant, which was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirteen people including a child reportedly died and over 200 people were hospitalized.

It was originally created by George MacDonald and Steve Peterson in collaboration with Rob Bell, Bruce Harlick and Ray Greer. The latest edition of the game uses the sixth edition of the Hero System, as revised by Steve Long, and was written by Aaron Allston. It was released in early 2010. Description Champions, first published in 1981, was inspired by Superhero: 2044 and The Fantasy Trip as one of the first published role-playing games in which character generation was based on a point-buy system instead of random dice rolls. A player decides what kind of character to play, and designs the character using a set number of \\"character points,\\" often abbreviated as \\"CP.\\" The limited number of character points generally defines how powerful the character will be. Points can be used in many ways: to increase personal characteristics, such as strength or intelligence; to buy special skills, such as martial arts or computer programming; or to build superpowers, such as supersonic flight or telepathy. This point system was praised by reviewers for the balance it gave character generation over random dice rolls. The stats in Champions are Strength, Constitution, Body, Dexterity, Intelligence, Ego, and Presence. Players are required not only to design a hero's powers, but also the hero's skills, disadvantages, and other traits. Thus, Champions characters are built with friends, enemies, and weaknesses, along with powers and abilities with varying scales of character point value for each. This design approach intends to make all the facets of Champions characters balanced in relation to each other regardless of the specific abilities and character features. Characters are rewarded with more character points after each adventure, which are then used to buy more abilities, or eliminate disadvantages.  The system  Players can design custom superpowers using the Champions rules system. Rather than offering a menu of specific powers, Champions powers are defined by their effects. (An energy blast is the same power regardless of whether it represents a laser beam, ice powers, or mystical spells.) The Champions rulebook includes rules governing many different types of generic powers which can then be modified to fit a player's idea. This allows players to simulate situations found in superhero stories. Like most comic book heroes, characters and villains are frequently knocked out of the fight but seldom killed. There are special rules for throwing heavy objects like aircraft carriers.  History and other genres  See also: List of Hero System Products The Champions system was adapted to a fantasy genre under the title Fantasy Hero (the first playtest edition of Fantasy Hero appeared before Champions was published), with similar advantages and disadvantages to the original Champions game. In 1984, the rules for Champions began being adapted into generic role-playing game system called the Hero System, although no formal and separate generic release of this as a standalone system would occur until 1990; instead the Champions rules would be edited down, expanded, and otherwise adapted on an individual basis for a variety of different genre treatments, such as pulp and modern espionage. Champions now exists as a genre sourcebook for the Hero System. Books for other genres have also appeared over the years, including Star Hero, Dark Champions, Pulp Hero, and Ninja Hero. Character archetypes and designs=Archetypes= While Champions does not use \\"character classes\\" as some RPGs do, it does define common superhero archetypes as found in comic books. These are based variably on how they use their powers in combat, motivation, or the powers' origin. As listed in the Champions genre book,Champions genre book. Pages 69-80. they are: *Brick - slower hand-to-hand fighter who relies more on raw strength and tougher defenses (Incredible Hulk / Colossus) *Energy Projector - primary combat ability is a ranged attack, which, despite the name, is not necessarily energy-based (Cyclops / Starfire) *Gadgeteer - abilities based on technological devices (Brainiac 5 / Forge) *Martial Artist (or martist for short) - lightly armored hand-to-hand combatant who fights with skill, quickness, and agility (Daredevil / Wolverine / Batman) *Mentalist - abilities target the mind, not the physical foe (Professor X / Jean Grey) *Metamorph - abilities involving changes in shape and/or size (Plastic Man / Mystique) *Mystic - trained in the use of magic, or with abilities or items with magical properties (Doctor Fate / Doctor Strange) *Patriot - an embodiment of his or her nation (Captain America / Captain Britain) *Powered Armor - a variant of a Gadgeteer, who uses an \\"all-in-one\\" gadget worn as armor (Iron Man / Steel) *Speedster - with abilities based around movement (Flash / Quicksilver) *Weaponmaster - with expertise at using a particular type of weapon (Green Arrow / Swordsman) *Sink - with primary abilities being drains or transfers a \\"Sink\\" can diminish, nullify or steal another characters powers, abilities or stats, either temporarily or permanently. (Rogue / Parasite) It is possible for a character to fall into multiple categories, such as Superman (brick/energy projector/speedster/Patriot), Batman (martial artist/gadgeteer), or Spider-Man (martial artist/speedster/gadgeteer). It is also common for characters not to fall into any easily defined category‚Äîthese categories are simply to provide easy definition and really have no impact on normative game play and do not imply stricture nor benefit within the rules. =The Champions Team= The Champions superhero team is presented as an example of how to build a well-balanced team in terms of game mechanics, including the hero Flare.

After its destruction by Dr. Destroyer, Detroit was rebuilt using the newest technologies and renamed. Hero Comics Starting in June 1986, a comic mini-series was published by Eclipse Comics based on characters from the first Champions campaign. After the initial mini-series a regular series was published by Hero Comics (later Hero Graphics, later still Heroic Publishing). Like the Villains and Vigilantes comic mini-series, the early issues printed character sheets which allowed readers to incorporate characters used in the comic books in their own Champions campaigns. Heroic Publishing still prints comics about some of the characters in 2007, although they have long since parted ways with the makers of the game. MMORPG A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the license was announced by Cryptic Studios, who had developed the popular City of Heroes and then reinvented Marvel Universe Online to Marvel Heroes. The game was released in September 2009. The game takes place in the established Champions universe and features classic Champions heroes and villains as NPCs.Game Informer, March 2008, Issue 79, p. 59 Reception In the January 1982 edition of Ares (Issue 12), Eric Goldberg noted the \\"sketchy\\" design of the first edition, and yet believed that \\"in many ways, it is sufficient... What enables the designers to get away with this minimalist approach is an unswerving devotion to the philosophy and to the spirit of the superhero comic, which itself has never pretended to be terribly complex.\\" In the April‚ÄìMay 1982 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 30), Dave Morris liked the first edition combat system, calling it \\"a good simulation of comic-book battles\\". But Morris questioned whether players would enjoy playing superheroes rather than more ordinary characters found in most other role-playing games. He gave the game an average rating of 7 out of 10, saying, \\"All the same, the occasional bout of world- saving might be enjoyable, and Champions is worth buying on this basis alone.\\" Reviews for two editions of the game appeared in Dragon: * In the January 1982 edition (Issue 57), Scott Bennie liked the well-written and concise text of the first edition, but noticed many gaps and holes in the rules, including a lack of any system for buying equipment. Nevertheless Bennie gave the game a thumbs up, saying, \\"Despite these flaws, I heartily recommend Champions. The more serious gamer will undoubtedly be put off by the silliness, and not everyone has a comic-book mind. But if you like this sort of thing, Champions is for you!\\" * In the October 1990 edition (Issue 162), Allen Varney disliked the slow pace of the 4th edition combat system. But he concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"Fans of previous editions will delight in the new consistency and versatility. Experienced players of other games, discontent with the arbitrary restrictions of their current system, should also find the HERO SYSTEM rules a superb investment. Lastly, for comic-book fans who want to simulate every maneuver they see in their favorite stories, the Champions game remains, after almost 10 years, the system to beat.\\" Reviews for various editions of the game appeared in The Space Gamer: *In the September 1981 edition (No. 43), Aaron Allston recommended the first edition of the game for those interested in the superhero theme, saying \\"If the subject matter interests you, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this product.\\" * In the September‚ÄìOctober 1983 edition (No. 65), Russell Grant Collins wasn't sure if readers should buy the second edition: \\"Should you buy this material? I think so, if you are interested in superhero RPGs. If you hated the original Champions rules for more than their slight omissions and loopholes, don't bother. The changes aren't all that significant. If you're happy with the old version, weigh your decision carefully.\\" * In the March‚ÄìApril 1985 edition (No. 73), Allen Varney recommended the third edition for everyone, saying, \\"Champions is the only superhero RPG I would recommend; and this edition of Champions is the one to buy.\\" * In the October‚ÄìNovember 1989 edition, (Vol. II, No. 2), Dave Rogers reviewed the fourth edition of Champions and recommended it, saying, \\"even if you have all the Hero Games products ever printed, it still has something new to offer. Now, it's the only role-playing game you'll ever need.\\" Ken Cliffe reviewed the 4th edition of Champions for White Wolf #20, rating it 3 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\"I recommend this book to anyone already familiar with the hero system, and suggest the Champions game to anyone who enjoys exact, complicated role-playing. To those looking for slick, fun role-playing, I say look to other SHRPGs and other game systems.\\" In a 1996 reader poll taken by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Champions was ranked 27th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"It wasn't the first superhero RPG and it never had licensed links to any big-name comics - but it's still the classic of the genre. It popularised the now-commonplace 'points-design' approach to character creation; in fact, it's probably the most flexible, detailed points- based system ever, which makes it rather overwhelming for some new players, and combat can be a little slow. But once you've learned how to use it, no other game catches the feeling of superhero action in quite the same way.\\" Champions was included in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Game designer Bill Bridges described Champions as \\"the superhero roleplaying game. While it wasn't the first game on the market that let you play superheroes and duke it out with supervillains, using earth-shattering powers, it was the most innovative. The major roleplaying games of the time involved characters stalking monsters in dungeons; the heroes in Champions delivered knockout blows to archnemeses ‚Äî all while speaking the requisite inspiring soliloquies.\\" Awards * ENnies ** 2005: Silver Medal, Best Adventure for Villainy Amok ** 2004: Gold Medal, Best Non-D20 Adventure for Champions Battlegrounds ** 2004: Silver Medal, Best Non-D20 Adventure for Shades of Black * 1999: Origins Awards Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame Reviews *Different Worlds #17 ReferencesExternal links *Hero Games **About Champions (archived from 2008) *Champions Online; official site of Champions computer game Category:Contemporary role-playing games Category:Hero System Category:Origins Award winners Category:Permadeath games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1981 Category:Superhero role-playing games ","title":"Champions (role-playing game)"},{"id":"168406","text":"Echt-Susteren (Dutch ; ) is a municipality in the southeastern Netherlands.

The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have since rejoined, and guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. The most recent additions to the band are guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller, who joined in 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide. After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major label Atlantic in 1993, and along with California-based bands like Green Day, The Offspring, NOFX and Rancid, they were responsible for the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s. Their seventh studio album and Atlantic debut, Recipe for Hate (1993), peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, and spawned one of their most popular songs \\"American Jesus\\". The band's 1994 follow-up Stranger than Fiction was also very successful, and included the hit singles \\"Infected\\", \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" and the re-recorded version of \\"21st Century (Digital Boy)\\"; the album was later certified gold, both in the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis (in response to the success of the label's then-artists the Offspring and Rancid), and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with \\"Sorrow\\", \\"Los Angeles Is Burning\\" and \\"The Devil in Stitches\\" being Top 40 hits on the US charts, and their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album, Age of Unreason, was released on May 3, 2019, and they are currently working on new material for their eighteenth studio album. History=Formation and early recordings (1980‚Äì1983)= Bad Religion was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1980 by high school students Greg Graffin, Jay Bentley, Jay Ziskrout, and Brett Gurewitz. Their first public performance was playing six or eight songs at a Fullerton, California, or Santa Ana, California, warehouse opening for Social Distortion. Their first official show was on November 11, 1980, at Joey Kills Bar in Burbank, California. In 1981, the band released their initial eponymous album on the newly formed label, Epitaph Records, which was and continues to be managed and owned by Gurewitz. Also in 1981, the band began recording their first full- length album, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? During the recording of this album, drummer Jay Ziskrout quit the band, and was replaced by Peter Finestone. Released in 1982, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? was also distributed by the band under the Epitaph label, and sold roughly 12,000 copies. =Into the Unknown, Back to the Known and hiatus (1983‚Äì1985)= In 1983, the band released Into the Unknown, a keyboard-driven progressive hard rock album with a slightly slower pace. Almost all of the albums the band produced were sold out of the warehouse they were housed in without the band's knowledge, after which this album went out of print. This incident, as well as band members' increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band's temporary dissolution shortly after the album's release. Soon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with Circle Jerks guitarist Greg Hetson replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, rock and roll version of their original sound with the Back to the Known EP. Eventually the band split toward the middle of 1985. =Reunion, Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain and Generator (1986‚Äì1992)= Bad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the Back to the Known line-up when Graffin called Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band's third album, Suffer, which was released in 1988. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, it received some positive reviews, and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as Trust, Maximum Rocknroll and Flipside. During the Suffer tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing new material. In early 1989, while the band was on break from touring, they commenced work on their next album, and entered the Westbeach Recorders studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, No Control, was released in November 1989, and was Bad Religion's best-selling album at the time, eventually selling more than 80,000 copies. Bad Religion's hardcore punk style continued with their next album, Against the Grain, which was released in 1990. While the album still did not break the band into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing. \\"21st Century (Digital Boy)\\", one of the tracks off the album, is generally regarded as the band's most well-known song, and has been played at almost every live show. Drummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion again in April 1991 to focus on his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, Generator, which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio, because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was \\"time to change\\" and the band \\"did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different\\". To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video \\"Atomic Garden\\", which was also their first song to be released as a single. To coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, 80‚Äì85, in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, their two EPs, Bad Religion and Back to the Known and the band's three track contributions to the Public Service EP. This compilation did not include Into the Unknown. 80‚Äì85 is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of How Could Hell Be Any Worse? with the same track listings. =Mainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993‚Äì1995)= With alternative rock and grunge breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion was signed to Atlantic Records in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album Recipe for Hate on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No. 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, with \\"American Jesus\\" and \\"Struck a Nerve\\" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time. Recipe for Hate was followed up by Bad Religion's eighth studio album Stranger Than Fiction. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\", \\"Infected\\", and a re-recording of \\"21st Century (Digital Boy)\\", which was originally released on Against the Grain. The band also recorded the song \\"Leaders and Followers\\" (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of Stranger Than Fiction) for the soundtrack for the Kevin Smith film, Clerks. The album was Bad Religion's first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded gold certification on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies. With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s punk rock explosion, along with Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid and NOFX. Right before the release of Stranger Than Fiction, Gurewitz left the band. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as the Offspring (who had just released Smash to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of selling out for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success. As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts such as \\"I want to know where Brett gets his crack\\" or \\"I want to know why Gurewitz cracked,\\" on the song \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\". These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's Suffer Tour documentary, Along the Way, and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band the Daredevils entitled \\"Hate You\\", reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley. Gurewitz was replaced as a guitarist by Brian Baker, a former member of the bands Minor Threat, Dag Nasty and Junkyard. Baker had declined a spot with R.E.M. to join Bad Religion. Since Greg Graffin and Gurewitz had split songwriting duties, Graffin was now Bad Religion's primary songwriter. =Post-Gurewitz period, departure of Bobby Schayer (1996‚Äì2000)= Bad Religion continued touring and recording without Brett Gurewitz and released three more albums for Atlantic, starting with The Gray Race (1996), produced by former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. Despite never garnering the amount of attention that Stranger Than Fiction received, it would score Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song \\"A Walk\\" as well as the European release of \\"Punk Rock Song\\". Brian Baker (left) with Bad Religion, live in the Netherlands, 1995. In 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, No Substance, produced by Alex Perialas, Ronnie Kimball and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with Stranger Than Fiction and The Gray Race, it was given mixed reviews by critics and fans.[ Ankeny, J: \\"No Substance\\" review] Following the release of No Substance, the band embarked on a year-long tour. In 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together, called \\"Believe It\\", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. \\"Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself.\\" In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, \\"I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything.\\" However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies). =Return to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001‚Äì2004)= In 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released The Process of Belief (2002). Graffin states, \\"there was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again.\\" Their next album, The Empire Strikes First, was released in June 2004. Like The Process of Belief, it is widely regarded by fans as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic. In April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except Into the Unknown). The How Could Hell Be Any Worse? re-issue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued 80‚Äì85 compilation, including their first EP, the Public Service EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self- titled EP) and the \\"Back To The Known\\" EP. To coincide with the re-issues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS Along the Way on DVD for the first time. Though Recipe for Hate was released on Epitaph, the album could not be re-issued; due to the fact that it was re-issued on Atlantic, problems with the rights ownership made a re-issue unlikely. =New Maps of Hell (2005‚Äì2008)= Bentley (left) and Graffin (right) with Bad Religion, live in the House of Blues, 2005. On March 7, 2006, a live DVD, Live at the Palladium was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium, as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist Brett Gurewitz said the band's next album would be a double-length release, but this turned out not to be the case. Greg Graffin released his second solo album, Cold as the Clay, on July 11, 2006. Bad Religion's fourteenth studio album, New Maps of Hell, was released on July 10, 2007. On June 29, of that year (Greg Hetson's 46th birthday), Epitaph Records started selling New Maps of Hell at the Warped Tour in Pomona, California. The album was a commercial success and spawned three hit singles \\"Honest Goodbye\\", \\"Heroes and Martyrs\\", and \\"New Dark Ages\\", and as a result, New Maps of Hell reached number 35 on the Billboard 200, marking Bad Religion's highest-ever chart position. Bad Religion also joined the 2007 Warped Tour to support the album. Hetson formed a supergroup band called Black President, consisting of Charlie Paulson (from Goldfinger), Jason Christopher, Wade Youman (both from Unwritten Law) and Christian Martucci (from Dee Dee Ramone).In the January issue of the magazine Alternative Press, it was revealed that their 14th album would be released in late spring 2007. In early March 2008, Bad Religion played several night residences at House of Blues venues in Southern California as well as Las Vegas. they performed four European festival appearances in May and June. On July 8, 2008, Bad Religion released their first-ever deluxe edition CD, a re- issue of then-current album New Maps of Hell. The deluxe version includes the original 16-song CD, along with seven new acoustic tracks recorded by Graffin (vocals/guitars) and Gurewitz (guitars/back vocals). Three of the acoustic songs are new, written specifically for this release; the other four tracks are new acoustic versions of BR songs. The release also includes a DVD with an hour-long live performance, music videos, and behind-the-scenes footage. =30 Years Live and The Dissent of Man (2009‚Äì2010)= In June 2008, Jay Bentley said in an interview at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands that Gurewitz had already begun writing new material for the next Bad Religion album. Bentley stated that the band was planning to return to the studio after Graffin teaches UCLA to start work on the follow-up to New Maps of Hell planned for a June 2009 release. However, according to a December 2008 report on the fan site the Bad Religion Page, Bentley revealed that due to Bad Religion's upcoming touring commitments for 2009, the band would not have a chance to record their new album until around the end of the year, for an expected 2010 release date. In August 2009, guitarist Brett Gurewitz sent an email to a fan site mentioning he was writing new material for the next Bad Religion album. In December 2009, Bentley revealed to the fan site the Bad Religion Page that the band was expected to go into the studio on April 26, 2010, to start recording their new album. He stated that a few songs for the album had been written and \\"it feels like the songwriting is picking up momentum. Baker said he was going to drive up to Graffin's, Brooks and I are going to do some demos with Brett, so we have a pretty good jump.\\" According to Brett's Twitter, Bad Religion is aiming for a fall release of the new album. In January 2010, Bentley revealed that Bad Religion would record their new album at a studio in Pasadena, California with Joe Barresi, who engineered 2004's The Empire Strikes First and produced its 2007 follow-up New Maps of Hell. Despite the statement made by Bentley about entering the studio in April, he noted that the recording date was now May 1. In March & April 2010, To commemorate their 30th anniversary, Bad Religion toured Southern California and Nevada House of Blues locations, playing 30 Shows, in 30 Nights, with a 30-song set each night. At the House of Blues concert in Anaheim, California on March 17, 2010, the band debuted a new song called \\"Resist-Stance\\" from their upcoming album. To coincide with the tour, Bad Religion announced a live album, entitled 30 Years Live, which was released as a free download for those who had signed up on the mailing list at Bad Religion's website. It consists of songs recorded during their House of Blues tour. It also included some new songs from their 15th studio album, before the new album was released. 30 Years Live was mixed by Mike Fraser and was released on May 18, 2010. On May 1, 2010, Brett posted an update on his Twitter saying, \\"threw me a going away [to the studio] party and all my friends hung with me tonight ‚Äì thx everybody, I love you guys.\\" This adds fuel to the possibility of the band's new album being recorded the first week of May. On May 12, 2010 (which happened to be Brett's 48th birthday), bassist Jay Bentley posted an update on their Facebook page regarding the recording process of the album: \\"first week of recording at joe's house of compression and brooks gets the medal for superasskicking. brian has finished 14 basics ... a couple more to go. i started getting some good bass sounds late, late last night, the liver wins the shootout again. brett is playing late night tracks on his birthday, some way to celebrate! happy birthday bg! quote of the day; BG \\"what percentage of the sound is coming from the snakeskin?\\". haha ... working of album titles and ideas today. it's all coming together. joe says the corn flavored kit kats are gross, but the wasabi ones are quite delicious ... get back to work. work work work. will send photo's soon\\". In June 2010, the Bad Religion Page reported that the new album would be released on September 28, 2010. Jay (who goes by jabberwock on the Bad Religion Page) mentioned on the site's message board that Bad Religion had finished recording their new album and was mixing it. In an interview at the Azkena Rock Festival on June 26, 2010, the band members announced that the new album would be called The Dissent of Man. The Dissent of Man was released on September 28, 2010. The album debuted at No. 35 on the Billboard 200 chart and at No. 6 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. On August 30, 2010, the album version of the song \\"The Resist Stance\\" was released on Bad Religion's MySpace page. A week before the album's release, it was made available for streaming on Bad Religion's MySpace page. The band has been touring to support the album through 2011. On October 18, 2010, Bad Religion released a vinyl box set of all their albums that is limited to 3000 copies, including their 1983 album Into the Unknown, which had been out of print for over 25 years. =True North (2011‚Äì2013)= In an April 2011 interview with The Washington Examiner, guitarist Brian Baker was asked if Bad Religion was going to make another album after The Dissent of Man. His response was, \\"It's all very punk [attitude] just like it's always been. We will record when we have enough songs. For us, it just kind of happens.\\" During the Boston show on April 29, 2011, frontman Greg Graffin said \\"after this year you probably won't be seeing much more of us. We're going to try one more album and then all join the navy, do honest work\\", hinting at a possible split or hiatus. Bassist Jay Bentley mentioned an early 2012 timeframe for going back into the studio in an interview at Live 105's BFD festival, which took place on the day after the Weenie Roast. In February 2012, it was reported that Brett had written two songs for the album. On June 25, 2011, Bad Religion performed a live set for \\"Guitar Center Sessions\\" on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt. According to a May 2012 interview with Pennywise guitarist Fletcher Dragge, Brett is writing a \\"fast\\" Bad Religion album. He also said that Pennywise's new album All or Nothing inspired Brett to write a sequel to the band's 1989 album No Control. On June 4, 2012, Jay Bentley confirmed on the Bad Religion fan site the Bad Religion page that they were expected to begin recording their new album in July and August. He also stated that Brett and Joe Barresi are going to produce it. On July 23, the band uploaded a picture to Bad Religion's Facebook page of all the members (except Greg Hetson, who was taking the picture) in the studio with the caption, \\"here we go again\\", indicating that work on their sixteenth studio album had begun. On August 22, Brett Gurewitz tweeted that they were mixing the album, and a month later, he tweeted that the band was finishing it. Greg Graffin later stated that the album was supposed to be out by Christmas. \\"Fuck You\\" was the album's lead single and released on iTunes on November 6, which happened to be Greg Graffin's 48th birthday. On November 5, 2012 (Bad Religion Day), it was announced that Bad Religion's sixteenth studio album, True North, would be released on January 22, 2013. On that same day, they premiered the new single \\"Fuck You\\". True North has received mostly positive reviews, and managed to reach number 18 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, marking Bad Religion's first ever top-20 album and highest ever peak on that chart in their entire 34 year career. =Departures of Hetson and Wackerman, and Christmas Songs (2013‚Äì2017)= Bad Religion played a few shows as a four-piece (without Greg Hetson and Brett Gurewitz) in mid April‚ÄìMay 2013, starting with their appearance at \\"That Damn Show\\" in Mesa, AZ on April 20 and including some high profile shows such as Groezrock in Belgium, leading fans to speculate over Greg Hetson's continued involvement in the band. On May 7, 2013, Jay Bentley issued a statement to the Bad Religion Page, which read, \\"Greg Hetson is dealing with some personal issues, if he wishes to make a statement we will support that, if he chooses not to we will support that. Mike Dimkich is indeed helping us out right now, and we are genuinely appreciative. Right now we are just looking forward and getting ready to play our shows.\\" The reason Hetson had not been touring with Bad Religion was likely due to the divorce of his second wife Alia. On January 11, 2014, Bentley confirmed on thebrpage.net that Dimkich is a permanent member of the band. A few days later, Download Festival's official website uploaded a photograph of the new lineup (except Brett Gurewitz). On September 10, 2013, it was announced that Bad Religion would be releasing their first Christmas album, titled Christmas Songs, on October 29, 2013. It is their first album not to feature Greg Hetson since 1983's Into the Unknown. In a November 2013 interview, guitarist Brett Gurewitz stated that Bad Religion would start writing their seventeenth studio album in 2014. Guitarist Brian Baker said that he hoped Bad Religion would start recording the album in the fall of 2015. In a September 2015 interview, however, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's Cold as the Clay, and that a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Graffin also said that Bad Religion would begin writing their new album after the release of this third solo album Millport, which was released on March 10, 2017. Baker said, however, that the album would not be released until 2017. Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to True North, Graffin said, \\"It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work. That's hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. Why has it taken us four years to release an album after True North? Well, True North was such a great album ‚Äî and we owe it to our fans to take it seriously as a great album ‚Äî that to do another one is going to take a lot more work.\\" From July to September 2014, Bad Religion embarked on the Summer Nationals Tour with Pennywise and their former labelmates the Offspring. The Vandals, Stiff Little Fingers and Naked Raygun supported them on selected dates. On October 27, 2015, drummer Brooks Wackerman officially left the band in order to pursue other projects, and a week later, he joined Avenged Sevenfold. Wackerman was replaced by Jamie Miller (...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Souls at Zero and Snot). =Age of Unreason and possible follow-up album (2018‚Äìpresent)= Bad Religion performing in 2018 On February 14, 2018, vocalist Greg Graffin posted a picture of himself with guitarist Brett Gurewitz in the studio on Twitter, and tweeted, \\"New songs in the pipeline\\"; this post indicated that Bad Religion had been working on their seventeenth studio album. Speculation about the album resurfaced in April of that year when Gurewitz and guitarist Brian Baker posted pictures from the studio on their respective Instagram accounts. On June 20, 2018, the band released their first single in five years \\"The Kids Are Alt-Right\\". Despite earlier reports that Bad Religion had been in the studio by mid-2018, and the fact that they had already released a new song, Gurewitz told Los Angeles Times in July 2018 that, \\"We're writing for a new album, recording this fall or late summer. No release date announced yet, but we should have an album's worth of 'Fuck Trump' songs pretty soon. It's exactly what we need.\\" On February 26, 2019, Bad Religion announced Age of Unreason as the title of their seventeenth studio album, which was released on May 3, and the album's lead single \\"Chaos from Within\\" was premiered. Do What You Want: The Story of Bad Religion, an autobiography covering the band's 40-year career, will be released on August 18, 2020 by Hachette Books. About four months after the release of Age of Unreason, guitarist Brian Baker was asked if Bad Religion was already working on a follow-up album. His response was: \\"No, I'm not really thinking about a new album right now because this one is still developing and there is a lot of world yet to play. 2020 is going to be a busy year for us, it's our 40th Anniversary year. We have a book coming out at the end of the year ‚Äì it'll be our first authorized, somewhat participatory, biography of Bad Religion. So there is a lot more to do with this record. The good thing about Bad Religion is that you don't really have to have a new product out to go work. The catalogue we have is so extensive and we are so fortunate to have the fan base that we have. So we don't really worry about a new album cycle, those thing just sort of come when they come. The next one might take four or five years, it might take two, I don't know. It's just about whether songs have come together in a way that is respectful of the Bad Religion standard. But in the meantime, we have Brazil to rock.\\" When asked in August 2019 about the future of the band, Bentley stated, \\"Everything I know about everything came from being in this band and came from some conversations driving in the van for hours on end. We're just these guys who don't want to stop asking why. We are what we are as Bad Religion. We're the thinking man's punk band, and that's kept us out of the mainstream. We're writing smart songs, and that makes us dumb.\\" In an August 2020 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Graffin said, \\"We've been working on some music, just as we're socially distant from each other; each of us has home recording studios. I always write music acoustically.\\" On April 29, 2020, Bad Religion announced on their social media accounts that they had to cancel all of their tour dates for that year, including a co-headlining US tour with Alkaline Trio, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, 2020 marked the first time since its inception in 1980 that the band did not perform at least one show. Bad Religion subsequently rescheduled their South American and European tour dates with Suicidal Tendencies, Millencolin and Pulley, which will take place in May and June 2021. Style and influences Bad Religion has been described as punk rock, skate punk and melodic hardcore. The band's major influences stemmed from late 1970s punk acts like the Ramones, the Germs, the Sex Pistols and the Clash, along with such early 1980s American hardcore bands as Black Flag, Minor Threat, and the Circle Jerks. Unlike many other hardcore bands of the era, they also acknowledged proto-punk bands like the New York Dolls, MC5 and Iggy Pop. Even more unusual for a band of the scene that spawned them, they were also informed by such new wavers as Elvis Costello, the Jam, and Nick Lowe, as well as authors like Jack Kerouac. The Beatles were also a huge influence on Bad Religion. The band said the Beatles were about the only band everyone in Bad Religion really liked. Reviewers have repeatedly cited an upbeat and positive tone to both the melody and lyrics, even when dealing with dark topics. Greg Graffin called his influences \\"pop-sounding rock tunes that were not necessarily commercial.\\" Brett Gurewitz acknowledges attempting to emulate Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion's lyrical style. \\"He wrote some intelligent stuff, and didn't shy away from the vocabulary, which I thought was cool.\\" In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents, in the way that they used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley says, \\"Seeing the Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it, too, because look, they're doing it.\\" In turn, various punk bands cite Bad Religion as an influence, including AFI, ALL, Authority Zero, the Bouncing Souls, Death by Stereo, Kreator, Lagwagon, NOFX, the Offspring, Pennywise, and Rise Against. Funeral for a Friend vocalist Matt Davies-Kreye has also mentioned Bad Religion as an influence, particularly with their Against the Grain album. Beliefs=Politics= Many of Bad Religion's songs are about different social ills, although they try not to ascribe the causes of these ills to any single person or group. Greg Graffin believes that the current political situation in the United States can make it difficult to voice these concerns, as he doesn't want to feed the polarization of viewpoints. The band contributed a song to the Rock Against Bush series organized by Fat Mike's Punkvoter, a political activist group and website whose supporters are primarily left-liberal members of the punk subculture. Brett Gurewitz attributed his anger towards former U.S. president George W. Bush as the major inspiration for The Empire Strikes First. \\"Our whole album is dedicated to getting Bush out of office. I'm not a presidential scholar but I don't think you'll find a worse president in the history of the United States. He's probably one of the worst leaders in the history of world leaders. I just hate the guy.\\" In a similar fashion, the album Age of Unreason was inspired by the band's disdain for Donald Trump. Bad Religion performed at L7's abortion-rights benefit Rock for Choice at the Hollywood Palladium on April 30, 1993 with acts such as Stone Temple Pilots, White Zombie, Bikini Kill, King Missile, and Free Kitten with Kim Gordon. Hetson wore a Rock for Choice t-shirt often when performing; one example was when the band performed \\"21st Century (Digital Boy)\\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 1994. Bentley has also worn Rock for Choice t-shirts, such as when they performed the Phoenix Festival in the United Kingdom in 1993. The band's song \\"Operation Rescue\\" on Against the Grain is a pro-choice song (named after anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue). =Religion= Despite the name of the band, or the band's logo, the members do not consider themselves antitheist. Singer Greg Graffin states that more often than not, the band prefers to use religion as a metaphor for anything that does not allow for an individual's freedom to think or express themselves as they choose. In this way, their songs are more about anti-conformity than anti-religion. Contrary to popular belief, Greg Graffin does not identify himself as an atheist, but chooses to identify as a naturalist. Despite this, he did co-author the book Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant?, which is based on a series of lengthy debates about science and religion between Graffin and historian Preston Jones. In 2010, Graffin released Anarchy Evolution, in which he promotes his naturalist worldview. The band's bassist Jay Bentley has stated that he has spiritual beliefs. Brett Gurewitz is a \\"provisional deist.\\" On March 24, 2012, Bad Religion headlined the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., sharing the stage with Eddie Izzard, Richard Dawkins, Tim Minchin and James Randi. Logo The Crossbuster Bad Religion's logo has been referred to by fans as the \\"Crossbuster\\". It features a black Latin cross with a red prohibition sign over it. It was created by guitarist Brett Gurewitz by drawing it on a piece of paper and showing it to the rest of the band. In the live documentary Along the Way, Greg Hetson, Greg Graffin and Jay Bentley are all asked the question \\"What's the meaning of the Bad Religion symbol?\\". Hetson: \\"The meaning of the symbol? It's, to me it's just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say 'You either believe it or not, this is the way it is' and that's not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be anti-establishment.\\" Graffin: \\"Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids and we thought 'Yeah, this is a great idea, it'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years-old, the first thing you think about is 'How can I piss people off?', you know? And it's very good to ... it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, especially it's easy to piss off your parents and adults, in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a no parking sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti- Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [sic] showing ... it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad ... it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will ... it's something mankind will ... I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans.\\" Bentley: \\"Brett made that when we were fifteen years-old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said 'That's really funny' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [sic] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just ... it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide.\\" Brian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, sums it up as follows: \\"The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ... These are not people who thought that 21 years later they would be on the telephone doing interviews.\\" A lot of Bad Religion merchandise including hats, belt buckles, t-shirts, and hoodies contain the Crossbuster. The logo was also used on many album covers.

The station opened in 1840, was rebuilt in 1852 and was relocated in 1969 to a new station just south of the original location -- where subsequently the prominent Montparnasse Tower was constructed. The original station is noted for the Montparnasse derailment, where a steam train crashed through the station in 1895, an event captured in widely known photographs -- and reproduced in full scale in several locations.Train Wreck Replica, retrieved 4 March 2009 The station serves intercity TGV trains to the west and south-west of France including Tours, Bordeaux, Rennes and Nantes, and suburban and regional services on the Transilien Paris ‚Äì Montparnasse routes.

On 25 August 1944, the German military governor of Paris, General von Choltitz, surrendered his garrison to the French General Philippe Leclerc at the old station. (see Liberation of Paris). During the 1960s, a newer station integrated into a complex of office buildings was built further down the track. In 1969, the old station was torn down and the Tour Montparnasse built on its site. An extension was built in 1990 to host the TGV Atlantique.

The current incarnation of the municipality has existed since 1 January 2003. The former municipalities of Oostburg and Sluis-Aardenburg merged on that date. The latter of these two municipalities was formed from a merger between the previous municipality named Sluis and the former municipality of Aardenburg. History Sint Anna ter Muiden and Sluis on the Ferraris map (around 1775) The town received city rights in 1290. In 1340 the Battle of Sluys was fought nearby at sea during the Hundred Years' War. There is a record of one of the first lotteries with money on 9 May 1455 of 1737 florins (US$170,000, in 2014). During the Eighty Years' War in 1587 the town was captured by Spanish troops under the Duke of Parma and was retaken in 1604 by a Dutch and English force under Maurice of Nassau. From 2006 until its closure in 2013, Oud Sluis was one of only two Michelin three-starred restaurants in the entire country. Geography Dutch Topographic map of Sluis, June 2015 In addition to the town of Sluis itself, the municipality is made up of the following population centres: Sint Anna ter Muiden, with a population of only 50 (2001), is a small village about 1 km west of the town of Sluis, located on the westernmost point of the Netherlands.

Their repertoire included elements of hip hop, soul and Caribbean music, particularly reggae. The members of the group were Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, and Pras Michel. Deriving their name from a shortening of the word \\"refugees\\", Jean and Michel are Haitian while Hill is American. Before disbanding in 1997, the group recorded two albums, one of which, The Score (1996), was a multi-Platinum and Grammy-winning success and contains their hit single \\"Killing Me Softly\\". Hill and Jean each went on to successful solo recording careers; Michel focused on soundtrack recordings and acting, though he found commercial success with his song \\"Ghetto Supastar\\". In 2007, MTV ranked them the ninth greatest hip-hop group of all time. Career=Formation and beginnings= Lauryn Hill and Pras first met at Columbia High School, in Maplewood, New Jersey. Pras, Lauryn, and a mutual friend Marcy Harriell formed a musical trio called Tyme; Pras' cousin, Wyclef Jean, joined the trio and Marcy left soon after in 1990. The moniker Tranzlator Crew refers to the name of their band at the time, which included Johnny Wise on drums, Ti Bass (Jerry) on bass guitar, and Leon (DJ). In 1993, after some gigs and recorded demos, the trio signed to Ruffhouse, distributed through Columbia Records. The trio's name was later changed to Fugees, which was purposely taken from a word often used derogatorily to refer to Haitian-Americans (refugee).Foege, Alec. \\"Fugees (cover story).\\" Rolling Stone. September 5, 1996: p. 40-47 Refugee Camp, while a name sometimes credited to the trio, also refers to a number of artists affiliated with them, and particularly Jean. The trio soon changed musical direction, and released their first hip-hop LP, Blunted on Reality, in 1994 under the guidance of Kool and the Gang's producer Ronald Bell. Although the album did not contain as many lyrics with overtly political messages as songs from The Score, there were still political intentions. The album spawned the singles \\"Boof Baf\\", \\"Nappy Heads\\" and \\"Vocab\\", but gained little mainstream attention, despite earning plaudits for its artistic quality and innovative use of samples.Weheliye, Alexander G. Phonographies:Grooves in Sonic Afro-Modernity, Duke University Press, 2005. =The Score= The musical qualities of their first record would be revisited with their second album The Score which was released in February 1996. The Score became one of the biggest hits of 1996 and one of the best-selling hip- hop albums of all time. The Fugees first gained attention for their cover versions of old favorites, with the group's reinterpretations of \\"No Woman No Cry\\" by Bob Marley & the Wailers and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" (first recorded by Lori Lieberman in 1971, remade by Roberta Flack in 1973), the latter being their biggest hit. The album also included a re-interpretation of The Delfonics' \\"Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide From Love)\\" in their hit single, \\"Ready or Not\\", which featured a prominent sample of Enya's \\"Boadicea\\" without the singer's permission. This prompted a lawsuit resulting in a settlement where Enya was given credit and royalties for her sample. The Fugees have continuously thanked and praised Enya for her deep understanding of the situation, for example in the liner notes for The Score. The Fugees won two 1997 Grammy Awards with The Score (Best Rap Album) and \\"Killing Me Softly\\" (Best R&B; Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group). =Later career= In 1997, the Fugees all began solo projects: Hill started work on her critically acclaimed The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill; Jean began producing for a number of artists (including Canibus, Destiny's Child and Carlos Santana) and recorded his debut album The Carnival; Pras, with M√Ωa and Ol' Dirty Bastard, recorded the single \\"Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)\\" for the soundtrack to the Warren Beatty/Halle Berry film Bulworth. In early 1998, they reunited to shoot a music video for the song \\"Just Happy to Be Me\\" which appeared in the Sesame Street special Elmopalooza, and also on the Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album. The three Fugees reunited and performed on September 18, 2004 at the concert in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn featured in the film Dave Chappelle's Block Party (2004), headlining a star-studded bill that included Kanye West, Mos Def, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, The Roots, Talib Kweli, Common, Big Daddy Kane, Dead Prez, Cody ChesnuTT and John Legend. Their performance received several positive reviews, many of which praised Hill's near a cappella rendition of \\"Killing Me Softly\\". The Fugees would make their first televised appearance in almost ten years at BET's 2005 Music Awards on June 28, opening the show with a twelve-minute set. With a new album announced to be in the works, one track, \\"Take It Easy\\", was leaked online and eventually released as an Internet single on September 27, 2005. It peaked at number 40 on the Billboard R&B; Chart but was met with poor reviews, noting its radical departure from the Fugees' sound. Disbanding In 2005, the Fugees embarked on a European tour ‚Äì their first together since 1997 ‚Äì from November 30 to December 20, playing in Finland, Austria, Norway, Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia. They had been scheduled to play at the Hammersmith Apollo on November 25, 2005; however, they were forced to move the gig to December due to production issues. The tour received mixed reviews. On February 6, 2006, the group reunited for a free show in Hollywood, with tickets given away to about 8,000 fans by local radio stations. Later that month, a new track called \\"Foxy\\" was leaked, a song dubbed the \\"REAL return of the Fugees\\" by several online MP3 blogs. However, following the reunion tour, the album that was said to be in the works did not materialize and was postponed indefinitely, as relationships between band members apparently deteriorated. In August 2007, Pras stated, \\"Before I work with Lauryn Hill again, you will have a better chance of seeing Osama Bin Laden and [George W.] Bush in Starbucks having a latte, discussing foreign policies, before there will be a Fugees reunion\\". Meanwhile, in September 2007, an equally outspoken Wyclef told Blues & Soul: \\"I feel the first issue that needs to be addressed is that Lauryn needs help... In my personal opinion, those Fugees reunion shows shouldn't have been done, because we wasn't ready. I really felt we shoulda first all gone into a room with Lauryn and a psychiatrist... But, you know, I do believe Lauryn can get help. And, once she does work things out. Hopefully a proper and enduring Fugees reunion will happen.\\" On July 15, 2017, an old song by the Fugees was leaked on Hot 97 radio leading to reports that the group was reforming. This was later denied by group members on Twitter. Fugees turned their recording studio, The Booga Basement, into a transitional house for young Haitian refugees immigrating to the United States. Legacy After the group split, Wyclef Jean co-founded and headed the Yele Haiti Foundation, a non-profit organization \\"focusing on emergency relief, employment, youth development and education, and tree planting and agriculture\\" in Haiti.\\"Who We Are.\\" YeleHaiti.

Scholarship Alexander Weyheliye's \\"Sounding Diasporic Citizenship\\" looks to the Fugees to consider the possibility for the term \\"refugee\\" to be a liberating call that builds international community as an empowering form of 'diasporic citizenship'. He writes that the Fugees \\"address the prejudices against Haitians in the States and also reclaim the figure of the Haitian refugee not as an instantiation of the abject but as a point of solidarity.\\"Alexander G Weheliye. \\"Sounding Diasporic Citizenship\\" in Phonographies: Grooves in Sonic Afro-Modernity.

The group was formed in 1986. The Geto Boys enjoyed success in the 1990s with the group's classic lineup consisting of Bushwick Bill, Scarface and Willie D, earning several certified albums and hit singles, including \\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\\" which reached No. 1 on the Hot Rap Songs and #23 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Geto Boys earned notoriety for lyrics covering controversial topics such as misogyny, gore, psychotic experiences, and necrophilia. About.com ranked the Geto Boys No. 10 on its list of the 25 Best Rap Groups of All-Time, describing them as \\"southern rap pioneers who paved the way for future southern hip-hop acts.\\" History The original Ghetto Boys consisted first of Raheem, The Sire Jukebox and Sir Rap- A-Lot. When Raheem and Sir Rap-A-Lot left, the group added DJ Ready Red, Prince Johnny C, and Little Billy, the dancer who later came to be known as Bushwick Bill. The first single the group released was \\"Car Freak\\" in 1986, which then followed with two LPs \\"You Ain't Nothin'/I Run This\\" in 1987 and \\"Be Down\\" in 1988. In 1988, the group released its debut album, Making Trouble. With the release receiving very little attention, the group broke up shortly thereafter and a new line-up was put together in which Bushwick Bill was joined by Scarface and Willie D, both aspiring solo artists. This new line-up recorded the 1989 album, Grip It! On That Other Level. The group's 1990 self-titled album, The Geto Boys, caused Def American Recordings, the label to which the group was signed at the time, to switch distributors from Geffen Records to Warner Bros. Records (with marketing for the album done by Warner Bros. sister label Giant Records) because of controversy over the lyrics. In the early 1990s, several American politicians attacked rap artists associated with the subgenre gangsta rap, including the Geto Boys. A high- profile incident in which Bushwick Bill lost an eye in a shooting helped boost sales of the group's 1991 album We Can't Be Stopped. The album cover features a graphic picture of the injured Bushwick being carted through a hospital by Scarface and Willie D. On the album's title track, the group responded to Geffen Records ending its distribution deal with Def American. The album featured the single \\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me,\\" which became a hit and charted at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rapper Scarface After Willie D left the group, Scarface and Bushwick Bill continued with the Geto Boys with the addition of Big Mike, who made his debut appearance with the group on 1993's album Till Death Do Us Part. Till Death Do Us Part was certified gold. The album spawned one top 40 hit in \\"Six Feet Deep\\" which peaked at #40 on the Billboard Hot 100. Subsequently, Big Mike was dropped and Willie D returned for 1996's critically acclaimed The Resurrection, and the 1998 followup Da Good Da Bad & Da Ugly, of which Bushwick Bill was not a part. After three years on hiatus, the group reunited in 2002 to record its seventh album, The Foundation, which was released on January 25, 2005. The Geto Boys were featured on Scarface's My Homies Part 2 album. The song \\"Street Life\\" from Till Death Do Us Part was featured on the motion picture South Central. A video clip for the song with footage from the film was released. Although the band rarely releases albums or perform together, the group came together for a reunion at Cypress Hill's SmokeOut festival in San Bernardino, California on October 23, 2009. In 2010, Bushwick Bill was threatened with deportation to Jamaica.Carroll, Susan. \\"Houston's own Geto Boy faces deportation.\\" Houston Chronicle. July 19, 2010. Retrieved on July 20, 2010. In a 2015 DJ Vlad interview, Scarface stated that he will not be involved in another Geto Boys album. On August 24, 2018, founding member DJ Ready Red died at the age of 53, from an apparent heart attack. Following the stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis of Bushwick Bill, a farewell tour, titled The Beginning of a Long Goodbye, The Final Farewell was announced, with a portion of the proceeds being donated to pancreatic cancer awareness. But this tour was cancelled at the last minute. On June 9, 2019, Bushwick Bill died at the age of 52 of pancreatic cancer. Lyrics and influence The group's name, Geto Boys, comes from a deliberate misspelling of the word \\"ghetto\\". For its first two albums, Making Trouble (1988) and Grip It! On That Other Level (1989), the spelling was the English standard \\"Ghetto Boys\\". For their third album, The Geto Boys, they changed it to the \\"Geto\\" spelling, which the group has used since. The Geto Boys' lyrics push gangsta rap themes to extremes, and sometimes focus on murder, explicit sex, and violence. The group is credited for putting Southern hip hop on the hip hop music map and inspired a legion of acts, including 2Pac, Eminem, UGK, T.I., Goodie Mob, Outkast, 50 Cent, Chamillionaire, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, Juvenile, Mystikal, Mac Lethal, Esham and Insane Clown Posse. Insane Clown Posse's Violent J (Joseph Bruce) described the Geto Boys as the first rappers to perform horrorcore, with their song \\"Assassins\\", released on their debut album, Making Trouble. Bruce says that the Geto Boys continued to pioneer the style with their second release Grip It! On That Other Level, with songs such as \\"Mind of a Lunatic\\" and \\"Trigga- Happy Nigga\\". The Geto Boys' popularity was boosted somewhat in 1999 by the prominent use of two songs‚Äî\\"Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta\\" (released as a promotional single for the 1992 compilation album Uncut Dope) and \\"Still\\" (from The Resurrection)‚Äîin Mike Judge's comedy satire film Office Space. The song \\"Mind of a Lunatic\\" has been covered by many recording acts including Marilyn Manson in 2003, as a B-side off the album The Golden Age of Grotesque. The single \\"Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta\\" has also been covered by the band Aqueduct and country singer Carter Falco. Their song \\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\\" was featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto V and also in the Netflix series Maniac. The Geto Boys are also heavily influenced by the social politics of the day. Their lyrics have consistently included themes ranging from police brutality (such as in \\"Crooked Officer\\") to concerns over the negative impact of violence on the urban community (such as \\"The World Is a Ghetto\\", \\"Geto Fantasy\\", and \\"Six Feet Deep\\").

Written in January and February 1958, it was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. The story centres on the investigation by the British Secret Service operative James Bond into the gold smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot: Goldfinger plans to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox. Fleming developed the James Bond character in Goldfinger, presenting him as a more complex individual than in the previous novels, and bringing out a theme of Bond as a St George figure. This theme is echoed by the fact that it is a British agent sorting out an American problem. In common with his other Bond stories, Fleming used the names of people he knew, or knew of, throughout his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after the architect Ern≈ë Goldfinger. On learning of the use of his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue, before the matter was settled out of court. Auric Goldfinger is obsessed by gold and‚Äîto Bond's eye‚Äîa gauche individual with unusual appetites; Fleming probably based the character on the American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard Jr. Fleming also used his own experiences within the book; the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based on a 1957 tournament at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered Peter Thomson, the winner of The Open Championship. On its release, Goldfinger went to the top of the best-seller lists; the novel was broadly well received by the critics and was favourably compared to the works of the thriller writers H. C. McNeile and John Buchan. Goldfinger was serialised as a daily story and as a comic strip in the Daily Express, before it became the third James Bond feature film of the Eon Productions series, released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond. In 2010 Goldfinger was adapted for BBC Radio with Toby Stephens as Bond and Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger. Plot Happenstance While changing planes in Miami after closing down a Mexican heroin smuggling operation, the British Secret Service operative James Bond meets Junius Du Pont, a rich American businessman whom Bond had briefly met and gambled with in Casino Royale. Du Pont asks Bond to watch Auric Goldfinger, with whom Du Pont is playing canasta, to discover if he is cheating. Bond soon realises that Goldfinger is using his assistant, Jill Masterton, to spy on Du Pont's cards. Bond blackmails Goldfinger into admitting his guilt and paying back Du Pont's lost money; Bond also has a brief affair with Masterton. Back in London, Bond's superior, M, tasks him with determining how Goldfinger is smuggling gold out of Britain; M also suspects Goldfinger of being connected to SMERSH and financing their western networks with his gold. Bond visits the Bank of England for a briefing on the methods of gold smuggling. Coincidence Bond contrives to meet and play a round of golf with Goldfinger; Goldfinger attempts to win the golf match by cheating, but Bond turns the tables on him, beating him in the process. He is subsequently invited to Goldfinger's mansion near Reculver where he narrowly escapes being caught on camera looking through the house. Goldfinger introduces Bond to his factotum, a Korean named Oddjob. Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III, Bond trails Goldfinger in his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (adapted with armour plating and bulletproof glass), driven by Oddjob. Both travel by air ferries to Switzerland. Bond manages to trace Goldfinger to a warehouse in Geneva, where he finds that the armour of the Rolls-Royce is actually white-gold, cast into panels at his Kent refinery. When the car reaches the factory in Switzerland (Enterprises Auric AG), he recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits the seats to the aeroplanes of Mecca Charter Airline, in which he holds a large stake. The gold is finally sold in India at a large profit. Bond foils an assassination attempt on Goldfinger by Jill Masterton's sister, Tilly, to avenge Jill's death at Goldfinger's hands: he had painted her body with gold paint, which killed her. Bond and Tilly attempt to escape when the alarm is raised, but are captured. Enemy action Bond is tortured by Oddjob when he refuses to confess his role in trailing Goldfinger. In a desperate attempt to escape being cut in two by a circular saw, Bond offers to work for Goldfinger, a ruse that Goldfinger initially refuses but then accepts. Bond and Tilly are subsequently taken to Goldfinger's operational headquarters in a warehouse in New York City. They are put to work as secretaries for a meeting between Goldfinger and several gangsters (including the Spangled Mob and the Mafia), who have been recruited to assist in \\"Operation Grand Slam\\"‚Äîstealing gold from the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. One of the gang leaders, Helmut Springer, refuses to join the operation and is killed by Oddjob. Bond learns that the operation includes killing the inhabitants of Fort Knox by introducing poison into the water supply. He manages to conceal a message in the toilet of Goldfinger's private plane, where he hopes it will be found and sent to Pinkertons, where his friend and ex-counterpart Felix Leiter now works. Operation Grand Slam commences, and it transpires that Leiter has found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (the leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she (Tilly) is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the Mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been captured by Goldfinger, who drugged a BOAC flightcrew and hijacked their jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership. Background and writing history By January 1958 the author Ian Fleming had published five novels in the preceding five years: Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956) and From Russia, with Love in 1957. A fifth, Dr. No, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Goldfinger. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: \\"I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\\" He returned to London in March that year with a 270-page typescript, the longest he had produced to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World; few alterations were made to the story before publication. Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor‚Äîboth of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications‚Äîidentified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of Goldfinger in 1957; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place from late-April to early-June that year. Fleming had long been fascinated with gold. He was a collector of Spanish doubloons, and he commissioned a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never actually used it; he wrote with a gold- tipped ballpoint pen and included the theft or obtaining of gold in several of his stories. When researching for Goldfinger, Fleming reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths‚Äîone of the livery companies of the City of London who assay precious metals for purity‚Äîwith a list of queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. The architect Ern≈ë Goldfinger threatened to sue Fleming over the use of the name. With the book already printed but not released, Fleming threatened to add an erratum slip to the book changing the name from Goldfinger to Goldprick and explaining why; the matter was settled out of court after the publishers, Jonathan Cape, paid Ern≈ë's legal costs, agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in conjunction with Goldfinger and sent him six copies of the novel. Once Fleming completed the novel‚Äîwhich he found the easiest of all the Bond books to write‚Äîhe thought he had exhausted his inspiration for plots. He told the writer William Plomer‚Äîhis friend who proof-read all the Bond books‚Äîthat Goldfinger was to be \\"the last full length folio on Bond ... Though I may be able to think up some episodes for him in the future, I shall never be able to give him 70,000 words again\\". Development=Plot inspirations= The clubhouse at Royal St George's Golf Club Fleming based some points in the book on events he had read about. The pre-First World War death of a showgirl in Europe after she had covered herself in paint was one such idea, and the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was a plot device Fleming had intended to use elsewhere, but which he included in Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window; Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it. As he had done in previous Bond novels, Fleming used the names of several friends or associates in the novel. The surname of Sir John Masterman, the MI5 agent and Oxford academic who ran the double-cross system during the Second World War, was used as the basis for the Masterton sisters; Alfred Whiting, the golf professional at Royal St George's Golf Club, Sandwich, became Alfred Blacking; while the Royal St George's Golf Club itself became the Royal St Mark's, for the game between Bond and Goldfinger. In June 1957 Fleming played in the Bowmaker Pro-Am golf tournament at the Berkshire Golf Club, where he partnered Peter Thomson, the winner of The Open Championship; much of the background went into the match between Bond and Goldfinger. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell; Fleming used Blanche as the model for Pussy Galore, although the name \\"Pussy\\" came from Mrs \\"Pussy\\" Deakin, formerly Livia Stela, an SOE agent and friend of Fleming's wife. Fleming's golf partner, John Blackwell (a cousin to Blanche Blackwell), was also a cousin by marriage to Ern≈ë Goldfinger and disliked him: it was Blackwell who reminded Fleming of the name. Fleming also disliked Goldfinger, who, Fleming thought, destroyed Victorian buildings and replaced them with his own modernist designs, particularly a terrace at Goldfinger's own residence at 2 Willow Road, Hampstead. Blackwell had his name used as the heroin smuggler at the beginning of the book, with a sister who was a heroin addict. There were some similarities between Ern≈ë and Auric Goldfinger: both were Jewish immigrants who came to Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists. The fictional and real Goldfingers were physically very different. According to the historian Henry Chancellor the likely model for Auric Goldfinger was the American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard Jr., whom Fleming had met in 1949. Engelhard had established a business, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. =Characters= The character of Bond was developed more in Goldfinger than in the previous novels; the historian Jeremy Black considers that Bond \\"was presented as a complex character\\". The novelist Raymond Benson‚Äîwho later wrote a series of Bond novels‚Äîsees Goldfinger as a transitional novel, making Bond more human than in previous books and more concerned with what Benson calls \\"the mortal trappings of life\\". This manifests itself in the opening chapter of the book as Bond sits in Miami airport and thinks through his fight with and killing of a Mexican thug. Benson also finds Bond developing something of a sense of humour in Goldfinger, verbally abusing Oddjob for his own amusement. The anthropologist Anthony Synnott examined several examples of racism in the Bond novels, and finds in Goldfinger examples of \\"the most blatant racism\\" of the series, all of which concern the Koreans; as an example, Synnott highlights the sentence \\"putting Oddjob and any other Korean firmly in his place, which, in Bond's estimation, was rather lower than apes in the mammalian hierarchy\\". Benson agrees that Bond is shown as a bigot in the passage quoted, and observes that this is the only point in all the works in which Bond disparages a whole race. The writer Anthony Burgess, in his 1984 work Ninety-nine Novels, describes Fleming's malefactors as \\"impossible villains, enemies of democracy, megalomaniacs\\"; Burgess goes on to write that Goldfinger \\"is the most extravagant of these\\". The character was described by Benson as \\"Fleming's most successful villain\\" to that point in the series, and Fleming gives him several character flaws that are brought out across the novel. Black writes that psychologically Goldfinger is warped, possibly because of an inferiority complex brought on by his shortness, in contrast to several of Fleming's other over-sized villains. Physically he is odd, with a lack of proportion to his body. According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th-century British spy novels, in several of Fleming's novels he uses \\"characters as psychological counters in a game of simplified psychology\\". Fleming writes that \\"Bond always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. ... Napoleon had been short, and Hitler. It was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world\\", an opinion Black considers a reflection of the \\"racialism and crude psychology\\" of early-twentieth century literature. Like many other of Fleming's villains, Goldfinger is not of British extraction (although he is a British citizen); other villains have been, for example, Russian, German, Jewish, Chinese-German or Slav. Synnott observes that in many of the Bond novels, including Goldfinger, \\"Ugliness, evil and foreignness go together, complementing and reinforcing each other. Ugliness symbolizes evil and evil is symbolized by ugliness and foreignness.\\" Fleming employs devices he uses elsewhere in the series to show Goldfinger is corrupt or outside what Fleming considered normal. Goldfinger cheats at cards and golf; Panek considers this is a traditional sign of a gauche individual. Black considers that Goldfinger is portrayed as a killjoy as he does not consume cigarettes or alcohol‚Äîunlike many people of the time‚Äîbut he does pay prostitutes; these aspects of Goldfinger's are condemned by Fleming for being outside normal appetites. Elisabeth Ladenson, the general editor of Romanic Review, believes the character of Pussy Galore to be \\"perhaps the most memorable figure in the Bond periphery\\". Galore was introduced by Fleming for Bond to seduce her, proving Bond's masculinity by his being able to seduce a lesbian. To some extent the situation also reflected Fleming's own opinions, expressed in the novel as part of Bond's thoughts, where \\"her sexual confusion is attributable to women's suffrage\\"; in addition, as Fleming himself put it in the book: \\"Bond felt the sexual challenge all beautiful Lesbians have for men.\\" Ladenson points out that, unlike some Bond girls, Galore's role in the plot is crucial and she is not just there as an accessory: it is her change of heart that allows good to triumph over evil. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett consider that many of the female characters in the Bond series depart from Fleming's accepted cultural norms; both Pussy Galore and Tilly Masterton conform to this rule because they are lesbian. For those that Bond sleeps with, there is a back story explaining why they are outside Fleming's norm: in Pussy Galore's case, it is because she was raped by her uncle. According to Stephen Heath, the literature and cultural historian, Galore's lesbianism is explained by being anti-man, following the rape, and she is converted because, as she says in the book, \\"I never met a man before\\". Bond's 'conversion' of Galore from lesbian to his bed partner \\"reflected Fleming's sexual politics\\". It was, Black sees, a \\"crude end to the book, a form of happy ending\\". Style The sixth Bond novel, Dr. No began what the media historian James Chapman describes as the move of the Bond books to \\"fantastic and highly improbable plots\\"; Chapman considers that Goldfinger maintains that trend. He also finds it \\"the most implausible of Fleming's plots\\". Benson states that the plot is impractical and that \\"sometimes there's no logic in the sequence of events\\"; the author Kingsley Amis‚Äîwho also later wrote a Bond novel‚Äîsays that the novel was \\"more implausible than most\\". According to Panek there is an episodic approach in Fleming's works; in Goldfinger this manifests itself in the use of the card game‚Äîsomething also seen in Casino Royale and Moonraker; Benson considers the novel to be more episodic than Fleming's previous books. Fleming structured the novel in three sections‚Äî\\"Happenstance\\", \\"Coincidence\\" and \\"Enemy action\\"‚Äîwhich was how Goldfinger described Bond's three seemingly coincidental meetings with him. Like Dr. No, what seems to be a trivial event‚Äîin this case the card game‚Äîleads to what Chapman calls \\"a grandiose criminal conspiracy\\". The denouement of the novel is described by Black as \\"hurried and unsatisfactory\\", and the \\"one-man heroism\\" of the work is too stretched across the novel. Benson, and Fleming's biographer Matthew Parker, consider Goldfinger to be the \\"densest\\" of the Bond novels, with a fast pace and high levels of action, in which Bond moves from Miami, via New York to London, then through Kent and northern France to Switzerland, then back to New York to Kentucky, to New York, Washington, and finally ditching the aeroplane in the North Atlantic. Themes As with other Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, gambling is a theme‚Äînot only the money staked on the golf match as part of the novel, but opening with the canasta game. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too, and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this, along with Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English, may be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956. Gold Bullion Depository at Fort Knox Benson identifies a theme of Bond acting as St George in Goldfinger which, he says, has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts. This is after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault: \\"Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something\\". Jeremy Black notes that the image of the \\"latter-day St George [is] again an English, rather than British image\\". According to Ladenson, by making Bond St George, \\"Goldfinger himself ... is a mere obstacle, the dragon to be got rid of before the worthy knight can make off with the duly conquered lady\\". Goldfinger has an obsession with gold to the extent that Ladenson says that he is \\"a walking tautology\\". Ladenson lists both his family name and his first name as being related to gold (\\"Auric\\" is an adjective pertaining to gold); his clothes, hair, car and cat are all gold coloured, or a variant thereof; his Korean servants are referred to by Bond as being \\"yellow\\", or yellow-faced\\"; and he paints his women (usually prostitutes) gold before sex. As with a number of other villains in the Bond novels, there is a reference to the Second World War, to show the post-war readers how evil Bond's villains were. Thus, Goldfinger employs members of the German Luftwaffe, Japanese and Koreans. For Operation Grand Slam, Goldfinger used the poison GB‚Äînow known as Sarin‚Äîwhich had been discovered by the Nazis. Pussy Galore's all-woman criminal gang has some members that look \\"like some young SS guardsman\\", to underline the connection to evil. Publication and reception=Publication history= Goldfinger was published on 23 March 1959 in the UK as a hardcover edition by Jonathan Cape; it was 318 pages long and cost fifteen shillings. As with his previous four novels, Fleming came up with the design of the front cover, which featured a rose between a skull's teeth. He commissioned Richard Chopping to provide the artwork. According to Jonathan Hopson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the cover's \\"macabre symbolism memorably expresses the novel's themes of greed, sex and death\\". The book was dedicated to \\"gentle reader, William Plomer\\". The novel went straight to the top of the best-seller lists. Fleming took part in a select number of promotional activities, including appearing on the television programme The Bookman and attending a book signing at Harrods. In May 1961 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 161,000 copies before the end of the year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at , has never been out of print. =Critical reception= Goldfinger received more positive reviews than Fleming's previous novel, Dr. No, which had faced widespread criticism in the British media. Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that \\"Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only in the direction of an atomic, sophisticated Sapper\\". Though Fleming may have left reality behind, Richardson considered that the writer, \\"even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable\\". Richardson said that Goldfinger \\"is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends\\", and, referring to the novel's central character, observed that \\"the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he is becoming more and more synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well.\\" In The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that \\"Goldfinger ... will not let [Bond's] close admirers down\\". Perrott thought that overall \\"Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe\\"; he summarised the book by saying that it was \\"hard to put down; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try\\". The Times thought that Bond was \\"backed up by sound writing\\" by Fleming; the critic thought that although the plot was grandiose \\"it sounds‚Äîand is‚Äîfantastic; the skill of Mr. Fleming is to be measured by the fact that it is made not to seem so\\". For The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Robson considered that \\"a new Bond has emerged from these pages: an agent more relaxed, less promiscuous, less stagily muscular than of yore\\". Robson added that \\"the story, too, is more relaxed\\". Robson saw this as a positive development, but it did mean that although \\"there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us, ... the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan\\". The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed \\"the things that make Bond attractive: the sex, the sadism, the vulgarity of money for its own sake, the cult of power, the lack of standards\\". The Sunday Times called Goldfinger \\"Guilt-edged Bond\\"; the critic for The Manchester Evening News thought that \\"Only Fleming could have got away with it ... outrageously improbable, wickedly funny, wildly exciting\\". Even the \\"avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man\\", Anthony Boucher, writing for The New York Times appeared to enjoy Goldfinger, saying \\"the whole preposterous fantasy strikes me as highly entertaining\\". The critic for The New York Herald Tribune, James Sandoe considered the book to be \\"a superlative thriller from our foremost literary magician\\". Burgess cites Goldfinger as one of the 99 best novels in English since 1939. \\"Fleming raised the standard of the popular story of espionage through good writing‚Äîa heightened journalistic style‚Äîand the creation of a government agent‚ÄîJames Bond, 007‚Äîwho is sufficiently complicated to compel our interest over a whole series of adventures.\\" Adaptations Goldfinger was serialised on a daily basis in the Daily Express newspaper from 18 March 1959 onwards. Fleming's original novel was adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in the same paper and syndicated around the world‚Äîthe first of the novels to be adapted as such. The adaptation ran from 3 October 1960 to 1 April 1961, and Fleming received ¬£1,500 for the British publication and a percentage for syndicated copies. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky. Goldfinger was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the Dr. No anthology, which in addition to Dr. No, also included Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love. Sir Ian McKellen: Goldfinger on BBC Radio 4 In 1964 Goldfinger became the third entry in the James Bond film series. Sean Connery returned as Bond, and the German actor Gert Fr√∂be played Auric Goldfinger. The film was mostly similar to the novel, but Jill and Tilly Masterton (renamed Masterson for the film) have shortened roles and earlier deaths in the story. The plot of the film was also changed from stealing the gold at Fort Knox to irradiating the gold vault with a dirty bomb. Alan Barnes and Marcus Hearn, in their examination of the Bond films, consider that the film improves on what they see as some of Fleming's \\"ludicrous notions\\". The pair highlight the irradiation of the gold in Fort Knox, and the change of Pussy Galore's organisation to stunt pilots, rather than masquerading as nurses, as examples of improvements. The 1973 BBC documentary Omnibus: The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond), including James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger‚Äînotably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam‚Äîand Diamonds Are Forever. Following its radio version of Dr. No, produced in 2008 as a special one-off to mark the centenary of Ian Fleming's birth, Eon Productions allowed a second Bond story to be adapted. On 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of Goldfinger with Toby Stephens (who played the villain Gustav Graves in Die Another Day) as Bond, Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger and Stephens's Die Another Day co-star Rosamund Pike as Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.

He was a member of the hip hop duo Gang Starr, along with DJ Premier. He was born in Roxbury, Boston. About.com placed him on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time, while The Source ranked him #30 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time, saying \\"Guru dropped some of the most thoughtful rhymes on wax\\".  Early life  Elam was born in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. His father, Harry, was a judge and his mother, Barbara, was the co-director of libraries in the Boston Public Schools system. He attended the Advent School on Beacon Hill in Boston, Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts, and Cohasset High School in Cohasset, Massachusetts for high school. Elam graduated with a degree in business administration from Morehouse College in Atlanta and took graduate classes at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan.  Musical career  Elam began his music career under the pseudonym MC Keithy E but later changed his stage name to Guru. He founded Gang Starr in 1987. The group initially released three records, produced by The 45 King, on the Wild Pitch Records record label, but these records received little attention. After a change in line-up, the group consisted of rapper Guru and producer DJ Premier. Gang Starr released its first LP No More Mr. Nice Guy on Wild Pitch Records; the group achieved a sizable following and released six critically acclaimed and influential albums from 1989 to 2003. Two albums, Moment of Truth (1998) and compilation Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr (1999) were certified gold in the United States by the RIAA. Gang Starr made archetypal East Coast hip hop with Guru's rhyming described as sharp-eyed but anti-ostentatious. In 1993, Guru released the first in a series of four solo albums while still a member of Gang Starr. Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 featured collaborations with Donald Byrd, N'Dea Davenport, MC Solaar and Roy Ayers and received positive reviews. His second solo LP, Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality, featured Chaka Khan, Ramsey Lewis, Branford Marsalis and Jamiroquai. The third installment, Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul, was released in 2000, but it received less positive reviews. In reference to the Jazzmatazz project, Guru told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: \\"Back around '93‚Äîwhen I first came up with the Jazzmatazz concept‚ÄîI was noticing how a lot of cats were digging in the crates and sampling jazz breaks to make hip hop records. But while I thought that was cool, I wanted to take it to the next level and actually create a new genre by getting the actual dudes we were sampling into the studio to jam over hip hop beats with some of the top vocalists of the time. You know, the whole thing was experimental, but I knew it was an idea that would spawn some historic music.\\"Guru & Solar interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' May 2009 In 1994, Guru appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as the album of the year by Time magazine. Guru with Gang Starr, Germany 1999 Guru's first solo album not a part the Jazzmatazz series, Baldhead Slick & da Click, was released in 2001 to poor reviews. The album reached #22 on the Billboard R&B;/Hip Hop album charts. Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures, was released in 2005 on Guru's own record label, 7 Grand Records. The album was produced by labelmate Solaar. It reached #54 on the Billboard R&B; albums charts and received mixed reviews. Guru's final releases were the fourth installment in the Jazzmatazz series, released in June 2007; and Guru 8.0: Lost And Found, released May 19, 2009 (also in collaboration with Solaar). A Gang Starr reunion album was planned but was not released because of Guru's death.  Death  On February 28, 2010, Guru went into cardiac arrest and, following surgery, fell into a coma. It was claimed that Guru had briefly awakened from his comaFaraone, Chris (3 March 2010). \\"Hip-hop Legend [the] Guru out of Coma, Issues Press Release. The Boston Phoenix but died on April 19, 2010, at the age of 48, from multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. Guru was survived by his parents, three siblings, and a son named Keith Casim. His production partner, Solaar, claimed that Guru had momentarily awakened from his coma to compose a letter to the public, although DJ Premier and members of Guru's family stated that he never regained consciousness. Guru's family claimed that Solaar had prevented them from having contact with Guru during his illness just before his death; the validity of the death-bed letter was consequently challenged by Guru's family. In an interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Solaar claimed that he was protective of Guru, and everything he had said was true. This interview was met by extreme emotion from the hip hop community and did little to clear the controversy surrounding his actions. DJ Premier produced a tribute mix to Guru and has released a public letter along with Guru's sister Patricia Elam. Harry J. Elam, an older brother, wrote a personal memoir in remembrance published in The Boston Globe on April 23, 2010. The Elam family had a Guru Tribute Web Site set up where visitors were able to view tributes and sign a memorial page. Guru's nephew Justin Nicholas- Elam Ruff made a 16-minute documentary in which he narrated the story of his late uncle. At the 2011 Grammy Awards, Guru's name was not mentioned in the annual retrospective of musicians who had died since the 2010 awards. On April 21, 2011, Revive Da Live Big Band held a tribute show for Guru at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. The show paid homage to Guru's Jazzmatazz series and featured a full jazz band tribute, with all proceeds going towards the Elam family. During the concert, Babygrande Records donated $5000 to Guru's son, K.C. Elam.  Legacy  The French city of Montpellier named a small street \\"All√©e Guru\\" after the rapper, citing his influence on both hip hop and jazz.

It was ruled by the monarchs of England and then of Great Britain in personal union with their other realms. The kingdom was administered from Dublin Castle by a viceroy (the lord deputy, later lord lieutenant) appointed by the king or queen. Ireland had its own legislature, peerage, army, legal system, and its state church. The territory of the kingdom had formerly been a lordship ruled by the kings of England, founded in 1177 by King Henry II after the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. By the 1500s the area of English rule had shrunk greatly, and most of Ireland was held by Gaelic Irish chiefdoms. In 1542, King Henry VIII of England was made King of Ireland. The English began establishing control over the island, which sparked the Desmond Rebellions and the Nine Years‚Äô War. It was completed in the 1600s. The conquest involved confiscating land from the native Irish and colonising it with settlers from Britain. In its early years, the kingdom had limited recognition, as no Catholic countries in Europe recognised Henry VIII and his successor, Edward VI, as kings of Ireland. Catholic Mary I was recognised as Queen of Ireland by Pope Paul IV. Catholics, who made up most of the population, were officially discriminated against in the kingdom, which from the late 17th century was dominated by a Protestant Ascendancy. This discrimination was one of the main drivers behind several conflicts which broke out: the Irish Confederate Wars (1641‚Äì53), the Williamite-Jacobite War (1689‚Äì91), the Armagh disturbances (1780s‚Äì90s) and the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The Parliament of Ireland passed the Acts of Union 1800 by which it abolished itself and the kingdom. The act was also passed by the Parliament of Great Britain. It established the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on the first day of 1801 by uniting the Crowns of Ireland and of Great Britain. History=Background= The papal bull Laudabiliter of Pope Adrian IV was issued in 1155. It granted the Angevin King Henry II of England the title Dominus Hibernae (Latin for \\"Lord of Ireland\\"). Laudabiliter authorised the king to invade Ireland, to bring the country into the European sphere. In return, Henry was required to remit a penny per hearth of the tax roll to the Pope. This was reconfirmed by Adrian's successor Pope Alexander III in 1172. When Pope Clement VII excommunicated the king of England, Henry VIII, in 1533, the constitutional position of the lordship in Ireland became uncertain. Henry had broken away from the Holy See and declared himself the head of the Church in England. He had petitioned Rome to procure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Clement VII refused Henry's request and Henry subsequently refused to recognise the Roman Catholic Church's vestigial sovereignty over Ireland, and was excommunicated again in late 1538 by Pope Paul III. The Treason Act (Ireland) 1537 was passed to counteract this. =Tudor Ireland= Following the failed revolt of Silken Thomas in 1534‚Äì35, Grey, the lord deputy, had some military successes against several clans in the late 1530s, and took their submissions. By 1540 most of Ireland seemed at peace and under the control of the king's Dublin administration; a situation that was not to last for long. Henry VIII was proclaimed King of Ireland by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542, an Act of the Irish Parliament. The new kingdom was not recognised by the Catholic monarchies in Europe. After the death of Edward VI, Henry's son, the papal bull of 1555 recognised the Roman Catholic Mary I as Queen of Ireland.Text of 1555 Bull The link of \\"personal union\\" of the Crown of Ireland to the Crown of England became enshrined in Catholic canon law. In this fashion, the Kingdom of Ireland was ruled by the reigning monarch of England. This placed the new Kingdom of Ireland in personal union with the Kingdom of England. In line with its expanded role and self-image, the administration established the King's Inns for barristers in 1541, and the Ulster King of Arms to regulate heraldry in 1552. Proposals to establish a university in Dublin were delayed until 1592. In 1593 war broke out, as Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, led a confederation of Irish lords and Spain against the crown, in what later became known as the Nine Years' War. A series of stunning Irish victories brought English power in Ireland to the point of collapse by the beginning of 1600, but a renewed campaign under Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy forced Tyrone to submit in 1603, completing the Tudor conquest of Ireland. =Stuart Ireland= In 1603 James VI King of Scots became James I of England and Ireland, uniting the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland in a personal union. The political order of the kingdom was interrupted by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms starting in 1639. During the subsequent interregnum period, England, Scotland and Ireland were ruled as a republic until 1660. This period saw the rise of the loyalist Irish Catholic Confederation within the kingdom and, from 1653, the creation of the republican Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. The kingdom's order was restored 1660 with the restoration of Charles II. Without any public dissent, Charles's reign was backdated to his father's execution in 1649. Stuart Ireland saw the establishment of the Plantation of Ulster in 1606, by King James I. The largest of all English and Scottish plantations in Ireland, its legacy can be seen today, as most of Ulster remains a part of the United Kingdom, and retains a Protestant and Pro-Union majority in its population A.T.Q.

Page 38.. =Grattan's Patriots= Poynings' Law was repealed in 1782 in what came to be known as the Constitution of 1782, granting Ireland legislative independence. Parliament in this period came to be known as Grattan's Parliament, after the principal Irish leader of the period, Henry Grattan. Although Ireland had legislative independence, executive administration remained under the control of the executive of the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1788‚Äì89 a Regency crisis arose when King George III became ill. Grattan wanted to appoint the Prince of Wales, later George IV, as Regent of Ireland. The king recovered before this could be enacted. =United Irishmen= Charlotte Schreiber's The Croppy Boy (1879), relating to the United Irishmen's Wexford Rebellion. A man, possibly a rebel from his green cravat, kneels before a Catholic priest who is covertly in military uniform. The church hierarchy opposed the rebellion. The Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the rebels' alliance with Great Britain's longtime enemy the French, led to a push to bring Ireland formally into the British Union. By the Acts of Union 1800, voted for by both Irish and British Parliaments, the Kingdom of Ireland merged on 1 January 1801 with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Irish Parliament ceased to exist, though the executive, presided over by the Lord Lieutenant, remained in place until 1922. The union was later the subject of much controversy.de Beaumont, G pp114-115 In 1937, the link to the British Crown was repealed, but the monarch was the de jure king in the new State until 1949. In the Republic of Ireland the 1542 Act was repealed in 1962.The Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962, section 1 and Schedule Viceroy The Kingdom of Ireland was governed by an executive under the control of a Lord Deputy or viceroy. The post was held by senior nobles such as Thomas Radcliffe. From 1688 the title was usually Lord Lieutenant. In the absence of a Lord Deputy, lords justices ruled. While some Irishmen held the post, most of the lords deputy were English noblemen. While the viceroy controlled the Irish administration as the monarch's representative, in the eighteenth century the political post of Chief Secretary for Ireland became increasingly powerful. The Kingdom of Ireland was legislated by the bicameral Parliament of Ireland, made up of the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The powers of the Irish parliament were circumscribed by a series of restrictive laws, mainly Poynings' Law of 1494. Parliament Roman Catholics and dissenters, mostly Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, were excluded from membership of the Irish parliament from 1693 and their rights were restricted by a series of laws called the Penal Laws. They were denied voting rights from 1728 until 1793. The Grattan Parliament succeeded in achieving the repeal of Poynings' Law in 1782. This allowed progressive legislation and gradual liberalisation was effected. Catholics and Dissenters were given the right to vote in 1793, but Catholics were still excluded from the Irish Parliament and senior public offices in the kingdom. As in Great Britain and the rest of Europe, voting and membership of parliament was restricted to property owners. In the 1720s the new Irish Houses of Parliament were built in College Green, Dublin. Church of Ireland Trinity College, Dublin was founded by the Elizabethans to serve as the organ of the Anglican intelligentsia. When Henry VIII was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church in 1538, all but two of the bishops of the Church in Ireland followed the doctrine of the Church of England, although almost no clergy or laity did so. Having paid their Annates to the Papacy, the bishops had no reason to step down, and in the 1530s nobody knew how long the reformation would last. Unlike Henry VIII, this hierarchy was not excommunicated by the Papacy, and still controlled what became the State Church of the new Kingdom in 1542, and retained possession of most Church property (including a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed). In 1553, Irish Catholics were heartened by the coronation of Queen Mary I, who persuaded the Papacy to recognise the Kingdom in 1555, via the papal bull \\"Ilius\\". Then in 1558 the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne, survived the 1570 bull Regnans in Excelsis, and all but one of the following monarchs were Anglican. Contrary to the official plan, the substantial majority of the population remained strongly Roman Catholic, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the state church. Despite its numerical minority, however, the Church of Ireland remained the official state church until it was disestablished on 1 January 1871 by the Liberal government under William Ewart Gladstone. Ethnic conflict The legacy of the Kingdom of Ireland remains a bone of contention in Irish-British relations to this day because of the constant ethnic conflict between the native Irish inhabitants and primarily the new Anglo-Irish settlers across the island. Their background espoused English culture (law, language, dress, religion, economic relations and definitions of land ownership) in Ireland as it later did across much of what was to become the British Empire. However Gaelic culture and Irish language, was maintained to a significant extent by the majority of the original native population. Sometimes this was presented as \\"barbaric\\", \\"savage\\" which later was perceived by the native population as a mark of undesirability in respect of maintaining and learning the language. While the Lordship of Ireland had existed since the 12th century and nominally owed allegiance to the English monarchy, many kingdoms of Gaelic Ireland continued to exist; this came to an end with the Kingdom of Ireland, where the whole island was brought under the centralised control of an Anglocentric system based in Dublin. This phase of Irish history marked the beginning of an officially organised policy of settler colonialism, orchestrated from London and the incorporation of Ireland into the British Empire (indeed Ireland is sometimes called \\"England's first colony\\"). The theme is prominently addressed in Irish postcolonial literature. The nominal religion of the native majority and its clergy; the Catholic Church in Ireland; was actively persecuted by the state and a set of Penal Laws in favour of the Anglican Church in Ireland, highly damaging to the native Irish Catholics, although a similar experience happened to English, Scottish and Welsh catholics during the same period. There is some perceprio that during Tudor times, elements within the government at times engaged in and advanced a genocidal policy against the Irish Gaels, while during the Plantations of Ireland (particularly successful in Ulster) the local population were displaced in a project of ethnic cleansing where regions of Ireland became de-Gaelicised, which led in turn to bloody retaliations, which drags on to modern times. Some of the native inhabitants, including their leadership were permitted to flee into exile from the country following ending up on the losing side in conflicts (i.e. the Flight of the Earls and the Flight of the Wild Geese) or in the case of the Cromwellian regime were forced into indentured servitude (although the same happened to English persons involved in the Cromwellian regime) in the Caribbean, following mass land confiscation for the benefit of New English settlers. On the other hand, the fact that the kingdom had been a unitary state gave Irish nationalists in 1912‚Äì22 a reason to expect that in the process of increasing self-government the island of Ireland would be treated as a single political unit. Coat of arms Coat of arms with the crest The arms of the Kingdom of Ireland were blazoned: Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent. These earliest arms of Ireland are described in an entry that reads: Le Roi d‚ÄôIrlande, D‚Äôazur √† la harpe d‚Äôor, in a 13th century French roll of arms, the Armorial Wijnbergen, also known as the Wijnbergen Roll, said to be preserved in The Hague, in the Netherlands but currently untraced; a copy is held in the Royal Library in Brussels (Collection Goethals, ms. 2569). This may have been an aspirational depiction for a putative High-King, for it was not related to the Lordship of Ireland at that time by the English king, who only assumed the title ‚ÄúKing of Ireland‚Äù later in the reign of Henry VIII O‚ÄôDonnell, Francis Martin.

In photography, a light meter (more correctly an exposure meter) is used to determine the proper exposure for a photograph. The meter will include either a digital or analog calculator which displays the correct shutter speed and f-number for optimum exposure, given a certain lighting situation and film speed. Similarly, exposure meters are also used in the fields of cinematography and scenic design, in order to determine the optimum light level for a scene. Light meters are used in the general field of architectural lighting design to verify proper installation and performance of a building lighting system, and in assessing the light levels for growing plants.  Use in photography  A handheld digital light meter showing an exposure of 1/200th at an aperture of f/11, at ISO 100. The light sensor is on top, under the white diffusing hemisphere. Leudi extinction meter METROPHOT VOIGTLANDER VC METER SEKONIC TWINMATE L208 KODALUX TESSINA METER LEICA IIIC WITH VOIGTLANDER VC METER II The earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density. The photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through. The letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed. Extinction meters suffered from the problem that they depended on the light sensitivity of the human eye (which can vary from person to person) and subjective interpretation. Later meters removed the human element and relied on technologies incorporating selenium, CdS, and silicon photodetectors. Analog handheld light meter - Gossen Lunasix 3 (in US: Luna Pro S); available from 1961-1977 8 mm movie camera, based on a galvanometer mechanism (center) and a CdS photoresistor, in opening at left. Selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic: they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure. Selenium sensors generate enough voltage for direct connection to a meter; they need no battery to operate and this made them very convenient in completely mechanical cameras. Selenium sensors however cannot measure low light accurately (ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits) and are altogether unable to measure very low light, such as candlelight, moonlight, starlight etc. Silicon sensors need an amplification circuit and require a power source such as batteries to operate. CdS light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure. These also require a battery to operate. Most modern light meters use silicon or CdS sensors. They indicate the exposure either with a needle galvanometer or on an LCD screen. Many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that. Photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels. There are two general types of light meters: reflected-light and incident-light. Reflected-light meters measure the light reflected by the scene to be photographed. All in-camera meters are reflected-light meters. Reflected-light meters are calibrated to show the appropriate exposure for ‚Äúaverage‚Äù scenes. An unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to underexposure. Badly underexposed sunset photos are common exactly because of this effect: the brightness of the setting sun fools the camera's light meter and, unless the in-camera logic or the photographer take care to compensate, the picture will be grossly underexposed and dull. This pitfall (but not in the setting-sun case) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere (usually, a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this) placed on top of the light sensor. Because the incident-light reading is independent of the subject's reflectance, it is less likely to lead to incorrect exposures for subjects with unusual average reflectance. Taking an incident-light reading requires placing the meter at the subject's position and pointing it in the general direction of the camera, something not always achievable in practice, e.g., in landscape photography where the subject distance approaches infinity. Another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter: a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone, typically with a one degree circular angle of view. An experienced photographer can take multiple readings over the shadows, midrange and highlights of the scene to determine optimal exposure, using systems like the Zone System. Many modern cameras include sophisticated multi- segment metering systems that measure the luminance of different parts of the scene to determine the optimal exposure. When using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter, for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film, the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film. There are other types of specialized photographic light meters. Flash meters are used in flash photography to verify correct exposure. Color meters are used where high fidelity in color reproduction is required. Densitometers are used in photographic reproduction. Exposure meter calibration In most cases, an incident-light meter will cause a medium tone to be recorded as a medium tone, and a reflected-light meter will cause whatever is metered to be recorded as a medium tone. What constitutes a ‚Äúmedium tone‚Äù depends on meter calibration and several other factors, including film processing or digital image conversion. Meter calibration establishes the relationship between subject lighting and recommended camera settings. The calibration of photographic light meters is covered by ISO 2720:1974. =Exposure equations= For reflected-light meters, camera settings are related to ISO speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation: \\\\frac {N^2} {t} = \\\\frac {L S} {K} where * N is the relative aperture (f-number) * t is the exposure time (\\"shutter speed\\") in seconds * L is the average scene luminance * S is the ISO arithmetic speed * K is the reflected-light meter calibration constant For incident-light meters, camera settings are related to ISO speed and subject illuminance by the incident-light exposure equation: : \\\\frac {N^2} {t} = \\\\frac {E S} {C} where * E is the illuminance * C is the incident-light meter calibration constant =Calibration constants= Determination of calibration constants has been largely subjective; ISO 2720:1974 states that > The constants K and C shall be chosen by statistical analysis of the results > of a large number of tests carried out to determine the acceptability to a > large number of observers, of a number of photographs, for which the > exposure was known, obtained under various conditions of subject manner and > over a range of luminances. In practice, the variation of the calibration constants among manufacturers is considerably less than this statement might imply, and values have changed little since the early 1970s. ISO 2720:1974 recommends a range for K of 10.6 to 13.4 with luminance in cd/m¬≤. Two values for K are in common use: 12.5 (Canon, Nikon, and SekonicSpecifications for Sekonic light meters are available on the Sekonic web site under ‚ÄúProducts.‚Äù) and 14 (Minolta, Kenko, Konica Minolta Photo Imaging, Inc. left the camera business on March 31, 2006. Rights and tooling for Minolta exposure meters were acquired by Kenko Co, Ltd. in 2007. Specifications for the Kenko meters are essentially the same as for the equivalent Minolta meters. and Pentax); the difference between the two values is approximately 1/6 EV. The earliest calibration standards were developed for use with wide-angle averaging reflected-light meters (Jones and Condit 1941). Although wide-angle average metering has largely given way to other metering sensitivity patterns (e.g., spot, center-weighted, and multi- segment), the values for K determined for wide-angle averaging meters have remained. The incident-light calibration constant depends on the type of light receptor. Two receptor types are common: flat (cosine-responding) and hemispherical (cardioid-responding). With a flat receptor, ISO 2720:1974 recommends a range for C of 240 to 400 with illuminance in lux; a value of 250 is commonly used. A flat receptor typically is used for measurement of lighting ratios, for measurement of illuminance, and occasionally, for determining exposure for a flat subject. For determining practical photographic exposure, a hemispherical receptor has proven more effective. Don Norwood, inventor of incident-light exposure meter with a hemispherical receptor, thought that a sphere was a reasonable representation of a photographic subject. According to his patent (Norwood 1938), the objective was > to provide an exposure meter which is substantially uniformly responsive to > light incident upon the photographic subject from practically all directions > which would result in the reflection of light to the camera or other > photographic register. and the meter provided for \\"measurement of the effective illumination obtaining at the position of the subject.\\" With a hemispherical receptor, ISO 2720:1974 recommends a range for C of 320 to 540 with illuminance in lux; in practice, values typically are between 320 (Minolta) and 340 (Sekonic). The relative responses of flat and hemispherical receptors depend upon the number and type of light sources; when each receptor is pointed at a small light source, a hemispherical receptor with C = 330 will indicate an exposure approximately 0.40 step greater than that indicated by a flat receptor with C = 250. With a slightly revised definition of illuminance, measurements with a hemispherical receptor indicate ‚Äúeffective scene illuminance.‚Äù =Calibrated reflectance= It is commonly stated that reflected-light meters are calibrated to an 18% reflectance, Some authors (Ctein 1997, 29) have argued that the calibrated reflectance is closer to 12% than to 18%. but the calibration has nothing to do with reflectance, as should be evident from the exposure formulas. However, some notion of reflectance is implied by a comparison of incident- and reflected-light meter calibration. Combining the reflected-light and incident-light exposure equations and rearranging gives :\\\\frac {L} {E} = \\\\frac {K} {C} Reflectance R is defined as :R = \\\\frac {\\\\mbox {flux emitted from surface}} {\\\\mbox {flux incident upon surface}} A uniform perfect diffuser (one following Lambert's cosine law) of luminance L emits a flux density of \\\\piL; reflectance then is :R = \\\\frac {\\\\pi L} {E} = \\\\frac {\\\\pi K} {C} Illuminance is measured with a flat receptor. It is straightforward to compare an incident-light measurement using a flat receptor with a reflected- light measurement of a uniformly illuminated flat surface of constant reflectance. Using values of 12.5 for K and 250 for C gives :R = \\\\frac {\\\\pi \\\\times 12.5} {250} \\\\approx 15.7\\\\% With a K of 14, the reflectance would be 17.6%, close to that of a standard 18% neutral test card. In theory, an incident-light measurement should agree with a reflected-light measurement of a test card of suitable reflectance that is perpendicular to the direction to the meter. However, a test card seldom is a uniform diffuser, so incident- and reflected-light measurements might differ slightly. In a typical scene, many elements are not flat and are at various orientations to the camera, so that for practical photography, a hemispherical receptor usually has proven more effective for determining exposure. Using values of 12.5 for K and 330 for C gives :R = \\\\frac {\\\\pi \\\\times 12.5} {330} \\\\approx 11.9\\\\% With a slightly revised definition of reflectance, this result can be taken as indicating that the average scene reflectance is approximately 12%. A typical scene includes shaded areas as well as areas that receive direct illumination, and a wide- angle averaging reflected-light meter responds to these differences in illumination as well as differing reflectances of various scene elements. Average scene reflectance then would be :\\\\mbox{average scene reflectance} = \\\\frac {\\\\mbox {average scene luminance} } {\\\\mbox {effective scene illuminance }} where ‚Äúeffective scene illuminance‚Äù is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor. ISO 2720:1974 calls for reflected-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a transilluminated diffuse surface, and for incident-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a point source in a darkened room. For a perfectly diffusing test card and perfectly diffusing flat receptor, the comparison between a reflected-light measurement and an incident-light measurement is valid for any position of the light source. However, the response of a hemispherical receptor to an off-axis light source is approximately that of a cardioid rather than a cosine, so the 12% ‚Äúreflectance‚Äù determined for an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor is valid only when the light source is on the receptor axis. =Cameras with internal meters= Calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by ISO 2721:1982; nonetheless, many manufacturers specify (though seldom state) exposure calibration in terms of K, and many calibration instruments (e.g., Kyoritsu-Arrowin multi-function camera testersSpecifications for Kyoritsu testers are available on the C.R.I.S. Camera Services web site under ‚Äúkyoritsu test equipment.‚Äù ) use the specified K to set the test parameters. Exposure determination with a neutral test card If a scene differs considerably from a statistically average scene, a wide-angle averaging reflected-light measurement may not indicate the correct exposure. To simulate an average scene, a substitute measurement sometimes is made of a neutral test card, or gray card. At best, a flat card is an approximation to a three-dimensional scene, and measurement of a test card may lead to underexposure unless adjustment is made. The instructions for a Kodak neutral test card recommend that the indicated exposure be increased by ¬Ω step for a frontlighted scene in sunlight. The instructions also recommend that the test card be held vertically and faced in a direction midway between the Sun and the camera; similar directions are also given in the Kodak Professional Photoguide. The combination of exposure increase and the card orientation gives recommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with an off- axis light source. In practice, additional complications may arise. Many neutral test cards are far from perfectly diffuse reflectors, and specular reflections can cause increased reflected-light meter readings that, if followed, would result in underexposure. It is possible that the neutral test card instructions include a correction for specular reflections. Use in illumination Light meters or light detectors are also used in illumination. Their purpose is to measure the illumination level in the interior and to switch off or reduce the output level of luminaires. This can greatly reduce the energy burden of the building by significantly increasing the efficiency of its lighting system. It is therefore recommended to use light meters in lighting systems, especially in rooms where one cannot expect users to pay attention to manually switching off the lights. Examples include hallways, stairs, and big halls. There are, however, significant obstacles to overcome in order to achieve a successful implementation of light meters in lighting systems, of which user acceptance is by far the most formidable. Unexpected or too frequent switching and too bright or too dark rooms are very annoying and disturbing for users of the rooms. Therefore, different switching algorithms have been developed: *difference algorithm, where lights are switched on at a lower light level than they switch off, thus taking ensuring the difference between the light level of the 'on' state and 'off' state is not too big *time delay algorithms: **a certain amount of time must pass since the last switch **a certain amount of time at a sufficient illumination level must pass.  Other uses  In Scientific Research & Development uses, a light meter consists of a radiometer (the electronics/readout), a photo-diode or sensor (generates an output when exposed to electromagnetic radiation/light) a filter (used to modify the incoming light so only the desired portion of incoming radiation reaches the sensor) and a cosine correcting input optic (assures the sensor can see the light coming in from all directions accurately). When the word light meter or photometer is used in place of radiometer or optometer, or it is often assumed the system was configured to see only visible light. Visible light sensors are often called illuminance or photometric sensors because they have been filtered to be sensitive only to 400-700 nanometers (nm) mimicking the human eyes sensitivity to light. How accurately the meter measures often depends on how well the filtration matches the human eyes response. The sensor will send a signal to the meter that is proportional to the amount of light that reaches the sensor after being collected by the optics and passing through the filter. The meter then converts the incoming signal (typically current or voltage) from the sensor into a reading of calibrated units such as Foot-Candles (fc) or Lux (lm/m^2). Calibration in fc or lux, is the second most important feature of a light meter. It not only converts the signal from V or mA, but it also provides accuracy and unit to unit repeatability. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceability and ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation are two well known terms that verify the system includes a valid calibration. The meter/radiometer/photometer portion may have many features including: Zero: subtracts ambient/back ground light levels, or stabilize the meter to the working environment Hold: freezes the value on the display. Range: for systems that are not linear and auto ranging this function allows the user to select the portion of the meter electronics that best handles the signal level in use. Units: For illuminance the units are typically only lux and foot-candles but many light meters can also be used for UV, VIS and IR applications so the readout could change to W/cm^2, candela, Watts etc. Integrate: sums up the values into a dose or exposure level i.e. lux*sec or J/cm^2. HortiPower spectrum meter to measure Photon Flux Density (light for plants) Along with having a variety of features, a light meter may also be usable for a variety of applications. These may include the measurement of other bands of light such UVA, UVB, UVC and Near IR. For example, UVA and UVB light meters are used for phototherapy or treatment of skin conditions, germicidal radiometers are used for measuring the UVC level from lamps used for disinfection and sterilization, luminance meters are used to measure the brightness of a sign, display or exit sign, PAR quantum sensors are used to measure how much of a given light source's emission will help plants grow, and UV-curing radiometers test how much of the lights emission is effective for hardening a glue, plastic, or protective coating. Some light meters also have the ability to provide a readout in many different units. Lux and footcandles are the common units for visible light, but so are Candelas, Lumens, and Candela per square meter. In the realm of disinfection, UVC is typically measured in watts per square centimeter, or watts for a given individual lamp assembly, whereas systems used in the context of the curing of coatings often provide readouts in Joules per Square centimeter. Regular measurements of UVC light intensity thus can serve to provide assurance of proper disinfection of water and food- preparation surfaces, or reliable coating hardness in painted products. Although a light meter can take the form of a very simple handheld tool with one-button operation, there are also many advanced light-measurement systems available for use in numerous different applications. These can be incorporated into automated systems that can, for example, wipe lamps clean when a certain reduction in output is detected, or that can trigger an alarm when lamp-failure occurs.

College Green () is a three-sided plaza in the centre of Dublin, Ireland. On its northern side is the Bank of Ireland building, which until 1800 was Ireland's Parliament House. To its east stands Trinity College Dublin. To its south stands a series of 19th-century buildings that are mostly banks. Streets leading onto College Green are Dame Street to the west, Grafton Street to the south, and Westmoreland Street to the north. College Green has been used as an assembly point for major political rallies. In the mid-1990s, United States President Bill Clinton addressed a crowd during his visit to Ireland. President Barack Obama spoke at the site in a major address during his visit in May 2011. History and layout The area was once known as Hoggen Green from the Old Norse word haugr meaning mound, or barrow. The cemetery at College Green consisted of several burial mounds, which are thought to have contained the remains of some of the Norse kings of Dublin.Hoggen Green (\\"Vikings in Dublin or Dyflin as they called it\\". Robert O'Connor. Viking Network) Between Church Lane and Suffolk Street the Norse had their Thing, an assembly and meeting-place, which was still to be seen in the 17th century. All along College Green, called Hoggen Green by the English, lay their barrows.Scandinavian Relations With Ireland During the Viking Period (A. Walsh, author. Dublin: The Talbot Press Limited. 1922) Hoggen gave its name to the convent of St Mary de Hogges, which stood roughly where the Bank of Ireland is now, and was a major landowner in the area until the Reformation. Statue of William of Orange on College Green, erected in 1701. It was badly damaged in an explosion in 1928, and removed in 1929. Several public monuments stand in College Green, including a 19th- century statue of Henry Grattan, one of the leading members of the old Irish Parliament, which stands facing Trinity College. Another statue, standing further back, is of patriot Thomas Davis. Previously, this was the location of one of Dublin's finest equestrian statues, of King William III of England (William of Orange) on horseback, by Grinling Gibbons, which features in James Joyce's story The Dead. It was taken down after it was badly damaged in an explosion in November 1928. Daly's Club, originally frequented by members of the old Irish Parliament, moved to number 3, College Green, in 1791 and remained there until it closed in the 1820s.T. H. S. Escott, Club Makers and Club Members (1913), pp. 329‚Äì333 College Green now exists as a street running from the front gates of Trinity College Dublin to pedestrian traffic lights close to The Central Bank in Dame Street at the junction of Trinity Street. The houses are numbered starting with 1 on the north side of the Street at Westmoreland Street and Trinity College and continuing across to the south side and back on the opposite side to Trinity College and the bottom of Grafton Street. Dubliners often incorrectly identify the street as Dame Street because it continues into Dame Street. College Street which runs from Pearse Street and Westmoreland Street passing railings on the Northern side of Trinity College Dublin is often thought to be College Green. Traffic restriction Crowds gather on College Green to see U.S. President Barack Obama in 2011. Since July 2009, College Green, during peak times on working days, has been accessible only to pedestrians, buses, taxis and cyclists. In 2016, plans were published for College Green to be fully pedestrianised, apart from a public-transport lane along the Trinity College side, to create a large public space in front of the Bank of Ireland. However, in October 2018 An Bord Plean√°la, the state planning agency, rejected the plan.

The intention was to create a single state and legal jurisdiction. The Acts were passed during the reign of King Henry VIII of England, who came from the Welsh Tudor dynasty. Before these Acts, Wales was excluded from Parliamentary representation and divided between the Principality of Wales, and many feudal statelets; the marcher Lordships. The Act declared King Henry's intentions, that because of differences in law and language:The Laws in Wales Act 1535 (A.D. 1535 Anno vicesimo septimo Henrici VIII c. 26) ‚Äì and therefore: Names and dates of the Acts They are sometimes misleadingly known as the Acts of Union (), but the legal short title of each Act has since 1948 been \\"The Laws in Wales Act\\". They are also often seen cited by the years they received Royal Assent, 1536 and 1543 respectively, although the official citation uses the preceding years, as each of these Acts this date was passed between 1 January and 25 March, at a time when New Year's Day fell on 25 March.Fryde, Greenway, Porter & Roy, Handbook of British Chronology, Royal Historical Society Guides & Handbooks 2, 3rd ed., University College, London 1986, p. 573 Background From the conquest of Gwynedd in 1282‚Äì83 until the passing of the Laws in Wales Acts, the administrative system of Wales had remained unchanged. By the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 the territory of the native Welsh rulers had been broken up into the five counties of Anglesey, Caernarfon, Cardigan, Carmarthen, and Merioneth. Even though the five counties were subject to English criminal law, the \\"Principality\\" was the king of England's own personal fief and Welsh law continued to be used for civil cases. The rest of Wales, except for the county of Flint, which was part of the Principality, and the Royal lordships of Glamorgan and Pembroke, was made up of numerous small lordships, each with its own courts, laws and other customs. When Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond (descended from an Anglesey landowning family) seized the English throne in 1485, becoming Henry VII, no change was made to the system of governing Wales, though he remained concerned about the power of the Marcher Lords and the lawlessness and disorder in the Welsh Marches. To deal with this there was a revival of the Council of Wales and the Marches, which had been established in the reign of Edward IV. After the deaths of many of the Marcher lords during the Wars of the Roses, many of the lordships had passed into the hands of the crown. Henry VIII did not see the need to reform the government of Wales at the beginning of his reign, but gradually he perceived a threat from some of the remaining Marcher lords and therefore instructed his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, to seek a solution. His solution was the annexation or incorporation of Wales which, along with other significant changes at the same time, led to the creation of England as a modern sovereign state. The Acts have been known as the \\"Acts of Union\\", but they were not popularly referred to as such until 1901, when historian Owen M. Edwards assigned them that nameDavies, John (1990), A History of Wales, London, Penguin 1994, , p232‚Äîa name some historians such as S. B. Chrimes regard as misleading, as the Acts were concerned with harmonising laws, not political union. The Acts This harmonisation was done by passing a series of measures between 1536 and 1543. These included: *An Acte for Laws & Justice to be ministred in Wales in like fourme as it is in this Realme (27 Henry VIII c. 26), was passed in 1536 in the 8th session of Henry VIII's 5th Parliament, which began on 4 February 1535/6, and repealed with effect from 21 December 1993; and *An Acte for certaine Ordinaunces in the Kinges Majesties Domynion and Principalitie of Wales (34 and 35 Henry VIII c. 26), was passed in 1543 in the 2nd session of Henry VIII's 8th Parliament, which began on 22 January 1542/3, and repealed with effect from 3 January 1995. The first of these Acts was passed by a Parliament that had no representatives from Wales. Its effect was to extend English law into the Marches and provide that Wales had representation in future Parliaments. The Acts were given their short titles by the Statute Law Revision Act 1948, s.5, sch.2. Effects of the Acts These Acts also had the following effects on the administration of Wales: * the marcher lordships were abolished as political units, and five new counties were established on Welsh lands (Monmouthshire, Brecknockshire, Radnorshire, Montgomeryshire and Denbighshire), thus creating a Wales of 13 counties;34 & 35 Hen. VIII. c. 26. * other areas of the lordships were annexed to Shropshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Cardiganshire and Merionethshire;27 Hen VIII, c. 26. * the borders of Wales for administrative/government purposes were established and have remained the same since; this was unintentional as Wales was to be incorporated fully into England, but the status of Monmouthshire was still ambiguous in the view of some people until confirmed by the Local Government Act 1972. For ecclesiastical (i.e. Church of England) purposes, several areas of England were parts of Welsh dioceses until disestablishment of the Church in Wales in 1920: the area around Oswestry, Shropshire ‚Äî part of St Asaph diocese ‚Äî was the largest. (In 1920, those parishes falling wholly within England were transferred to English dioceses, though parishes partly in England and partly in Wales were allowed to elect either to remain in the Church of England or to join the newly disestablished Church in Wales: 17 out of 18 voted to stay with the Church of England so there is a little area of England in the Church in Wales diocese of St Asaph, and larger areas of Wales still within Church of England dioceses.) * Wales elected members to the English (Westminster) Parliament;34 & 35 Hen. VIII. c. 26. ¬ß 50 * the Council of Wales and the Marches was established on a legal basis;26 Hen. VIII c.6 * the Court of Great Sessions was established, a system peculiar to Wales;34 & 35 Hen VIII, c. 26 ¬ß 4 * a Sheriff was appointed in every county, and other county officers as in England;27 Hen. VIII, c. 5. * the courts of the marcher lordships lost the power to try serious criminal cases; * all courts in Wales were to be conducted in the English language, not Welsh;27 Hen VIII, c. 26 ¬ß 17 *the office of Justice of the Peace was introduced, nine to every county; * each county or shire consisted of fewer than a dozen hundreds corresponding with varying degrees of accuracy to the former commotes. These measures were not unpopular with the Welsh gentry in particular, who recognised that they would give them equality under law with English citizens. The reactions of many of the prominent Welsh of the day and down the centuries were very similar: gratitude that the laws had been introduced and made Wales a peaceful and orderly country. Despite historians such as G. R. Elton, who treated the Acts as merely a triumph of Tudor efficiency, modern British, and particularly Welsh, historians are more likely to investigate evidence of the damaging effects of the Acts on Welsh identity, culture, and economy. While the Welsh gentry embraced the Acts and quickly attempted to merge themselves into English aristocracy, the majority of the population could have found themselves adrift amid a legal and economic system whose language and focus were unfamiliar to them. The Acts and the Welsh language An example of the effects on the Welsh language is the first section of the 1535 Act, which states: The same section then goes on to say that: Section 20 of the 1535 Act made English the only language of the law courts and said that those who used Welsh would not be appointed to, or paid for, any public office in Wales: This language clause laid the foundation for a thoroughly anglicised ruling class of landed gentry in Wales, which would have many consequences. The parts of the 1535 Act relating to language were definitively repealed only in 1993, by the Welsh Language Act 1993, though annotations at Legislation.gov.uk read that sections 18‚Äì21 were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887.

Cixous is best known for her article \\"The Laugh of the Medusa\\", which established her as one of the early thinkers in post-structural feminism. She founded the first centre of feminist studies at a European university at the Centre universitaire de Vincennes of the University of Paris (today's University of Paris VIII). She holds honorary degrees from Queen's University and the University of Alberta in Canada; University College Dublin in Ireland; the University of York and University College London in the UK; and Georgetown University, Northwestern University, and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in the USA. In 2008 she was appointed as A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University until June 2014. Life and career= Academic career = Cixous earned her agr√©gation in English in 1959 and her Doctorat √®s lettres in 1968. Her main focus, at this time, was English literature and the works of James Joyce. Cixous became assistante at the University of Bordeaux in 1962, served as ma√Ætre assistante at the Sorbonne from 1965 to 1967, and was appointed ma√Ætre de conf√©rence at Paris Nanterre University in 1967. In 1968, following the French student riots, Cixous was charged with founding the University of Paris VIII, \\"created to serve as an alternative to the traditional French academic environment.\\" Cixous would, in 1974, found the University's center for women's studies, the first in Europe. Cixous is a professor at the University of Paris VIII and at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. = Publications = In 1968, Cixous published her doctoral dissertation L'Exil de James Joyce ou l'Art du remplacement (The Exile of James Joyce, or the Art of Displacement) and the following year she published her first novel, Dedans (Inside), a semi-autobiographical work that won the Prix M√©dicis. She has published widely, including twenty-three volumes of poems, six books of essays, five plays, and numerous influential articles. She published Voiles (Veils) with Jacques Derrida and her work is often considered deconstructive. In introducing her Wellek Lecture, subsequently published as Three Steps on the Ladder of Writing, Derrida referred to her as the greatest living writer in his language (French). Cixous wrote a book on Derrida titled Portrait de Jacques Derrida en jeune saint juif (Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint). Her reading of Derrida finds additional layers of meaning at a phonemic rather than strictly lexical level.Not the same as puns, which play on the varied means of a word or phrase or the homonyms thereof. In addition to Derrida and Joyce, she has written monographs on the work of the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, on Maurice Blanchot, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Michel de Montaigne, Ingeborg Bachmann, Thomas Bernhard, and the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva. Cixous is also the author of essays on artists, including Simon Hanta√Ø, Pierre Alechinsky and Adel Abdessemed to whom she has devoted two books. Along with Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, Cixous is considered one of the mothers of poststructuralist feminist theory. In the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between sexuality and language. Like other poststructuralist feminist theorists, Cixous believes that our sexuality is directly tied to how we communicate in society. In 1975, Cixous published her most influential article \\"Le rire de la m√©duse\\" (\\"The Laugh of the Medusa\\"), which was revised by her, translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen, and released in English in 1976. She has published over 70 works; her fiction, dramatic writing and poetry, however, are not often read in English. =The Biblioth√®que nationale de France= In 2000, a collection in Cixous' name was created at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France after Cixous donated the entirety of her manuscripts to date. They then featured in the exhibit \\"Brouillons d'√©crivains\\" held there in 2001. In 2003, the Biblioth√®que held the conference \\"Gen√®ses G√©n√©alogies Genres: Autour de l'oeuvre d'H√©l√®ne Cixous\\". Among the speakers were Mireille Calle-Gruber, Marie Odile Germain, Jacques Derrida, Annie Leclerc, Ariane Mnouchkine, Ginette Michaud, and H√©l√®ne Cixous herself. = Film = H√©l√®ne Cixous is featured in Olivier Morel's 118-minute film Ever, R√™ve, H√©l√®ne Cixous (France, USA, 2018). = Personal life = Cixous was born in Oran, French Algeria to Jewish parents, Eve Cixous, n√©e Klein (1910‚Äì2013) and Georges Cixous (1909‚Äì1948). Georges Cixous, a physician who had written his dissertation on tuberculosis, died of the disease in 1948. Eve Cixous became a midwife following his death, \\"until her expulsion with the last French doctors and midwives in 1971.\\" Cixous' brother, Pierre, \\"a medical student and a supporter of Algerian independence\\" was condemned to death in 1961 by the Organisation Arm√©e Secr√®te, and would join Cixous in Bordeaux. Her mother and brother would return to Algeria following the country's independence in 1962. They would be arrested, and Cixous \\"obtained their release with the help of Ahmed Ben Bella's lawyer.\\" Cixous married Guy Berger in 1955, with whom she had three children, Anne-Emmanuelle (b. 1958), St√©phane (1960‚Äì1961), and Pierre-Fran√ßois (b. 1961). Cixous and Berger divorced in 1964. Influences on Cixous' writing Some of the most notable influences on her writings have been Jacques Derrida, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan and Arthur Rimbaud. =Sigmund Freud= Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud established the initial theories which would serve as a basis for some of Cixous' arguments in developmental psychology. Freud's analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate paths for boys and girls through the Oedipus complex, theories of which Cixous was particularly critical. =Jacques Derrida= Contemporaries, lifelong friends, and intellectuals, Jacques Derrida and Cixous both grew up as French Jews in Algeria and share a \\"belonging constituted of exclusion and nonbelonging\\"‚Äînot Algerian, rejected by France, their Jewishness concealed or acculturated. In Derrida's family \\"one never said 'circumcision' but 'baptism,' not 'Bar Mitzvah' but 'communion.'\\" Judaism cloaked in Catholicism is one example of the undecidability of identity that influenced the thinker whom Cixous calls a \\"Jewish Saint\\". Her book Portrait of Jacques Derrida as a Young Jewish Saint addresses these matters. Through deconstruction, Derrida employed the term logocentrism (which was not his coinage). This is the concept that explains how language relies on a hierarchical system that values the spoken word over the written word in Western culture. The idea of binary opposition is essential to Cixous' position on language. Cixous and Luce Irigaray combined Derrida's logocentric idea and Lacan's symbol for desire, creating the term phallogocentrism. This term focuses on Derrida's social structure of speech and binary opposition as the center of reference for language, with the phallic being privileged and how women are only defined by what they lack; not A vs. B, but, rather A vs. ¬¨A (not-A). In a dialogue between Derrida and Cixous, Derrida said about Cixous: \\"Helene's texts are translated across the world, but they remain untranslatable. We are two French writers who cultivate a strange relationship, or a strangely familiar relationship with the French language ‚Äì at once more translated and more untranslatable than many a French author. We are more rooted in the French language than those with ancestral roots in this culture and this land.\\" Major works=The Laugh of the Medusa (1975)= Cixous' critical feminist essay \\"The Laugh of the Medusa\\", originally written in French as Le Rire de la M√©duse in 1975, was (after she revised it) translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen in 1976. It has become a seminal essay, particularly because it announces what Cixous called √©criture f√©minine, a distinctive mode of writing for women and by women.

Note the 'swirly' bokeh. How the bokeh varies with the aperture. In photography, bokeh ( or ; ) is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in out-of-focus parts of an image. Bokeh has also been defined as \\"the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light\\". Differences in lens aberrations and aperture shape cause very different bokeh effects. Some lens designs blur the image in a way that is pleasing to the eye, while others produce distracting or unpleasant blurring (\\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" bokeh, respectively). Photographers may deliberately use a shallow focus technique to create images with prominent out-of-focus regions, accentuating their lens's bokeh. Bokeh is often most visible around small background highlights, such as specular reflections and light sources, which is why it is often associated with such areas. However, bokeh is not limited to highlights; blur occurs in all regions of an image which are outside the depth of field. Origin The term comes from the Japanese word boke ( or ), which means \\"blur\\" or \\"haze\\", or boke-aji (), the \\"blur quality\\". This is derived as a noun form of the verb bokeru (which is written in several ways, with additional meanings and nuances: refers to being blurry, hazy or out-of-focus, whereas the and spellings refer to being mentally hazy, befuddled, childish, senile, or playing stupid. Jisaboke () (literally, \\"time difference haze\\") is the term for jet lag. Nebokeru ( is a verb denoting the actions or condition of someone who is half-asleep, or nodding off. Tobokeru means playing dumb, and toboketa kao refers to a poker face. The related verb h≈çkeru shares spelling with these and has the same meanings; in addition, that form acts as compound verb suffix, indicating that the subject is absorbed into the action denoted by the main verb: for instance, asobih≈çkeru (), combining asobu and h≈çkeru, expresses being absorbed in play. The related term bokashi () means intentional blurring or gradation; that is a noun form of the transitive verb bokasu which means to make something blurry, rather than to be blurry. The English spelling bokeh was popularized in 1997 in Photo Techniques magazine, when Mike Johnston, the editor at the time, commissioned three papers on the topic for the May/June 1997 issue; he altered the spelling to suggest the correct pronunciation to English speakers, saying \\"it is properly pronounced with bo as in bone and ke as in Kenneth, with equal stress on either syllable\\". The spellings bokeh and boke have both been in use since at least 1996, when Merklinger had suggested \\"or Bokeh if you prefer.\\" The term bokeh has appeared in photography books as early as 1998. It is sometimes pronounced (boke-uh). Bokeh and lens design The depth of field is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye. Though difficult to quantify, some lenses have subjectively more pleasing out-of-focus areas. \\"Good\\" bokeh is especially important for macro lenses and long telephoto lenses, because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow depth of field. Good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses (typically 85‚Äì150 mm on 35 mm format). When used in portrait photography (for their \\"natural\\" perspective), the photographer usually wants a shallow depth of field, so that the subject stands out sharply against a blurred background. Bokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image's circle of confusion. In out-of-focus areas, each point of light becomes an image of the aperture, generally a more or less round disc. Depending on how a lens is corrected for spherical aberration, the disc may be uniformly illuminated, brighter near the edge, or brighter near the center. A well-known lens that exhibited the latter \\"soap-bubble\\" characteristic was that produced by Hugo Meyer & Co., more recently revived by Meyer Optik G√∂rlitz. Lenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out- of-focus points in front of the plane of focus, and a different kind for points behind. This may actually be desirable, as blur circles that are dimmer near the edges produce less-defined shapes which blend smoothly with the surrounding image. The shape of the aperture has an influence on the subjective quality of bokeh as well. For conventional lens designs (with bladed apertures), when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum aperture size (minimum f-number), out-of-focus points are blurred into the polygonal shape formed by the aperture blades. This is most apparent when a lens produces hard-edged bokeh. For this reason, some lenses have many aperture blades and/or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle rather than a polygon. Minolta has been on the forefront of promoting and introducing lenses with near-ideal circular apertures since 1987, but most other manufacturers now offer lenses with shape-optimized diaphragms, at least for the domain of portraiture photography. In contrast, a catadioptric telephoto lens renders bokehs resembling doughnuts, because its secondary mirror blocks the central part of the aperture opening. Recently, photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars, that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be, and placing it over the lens. Lenses with 11, 12, or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality. Because of this, the lenses do not need to reach wide apertures to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required, at a time when all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good bokeh at f/4.5. Today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh. Some lens manufacturers including Nikon, Minolta, and Sony make lenses designed with specific controls to change the rendering of the out-of-focus areas. The Nikon 105 mm DC-Nikkor and 135 mm DC-Nikkor lenses (DC stands for \\"Defocus Control\\") have a control ring that permits the overcorrection or undercorrection of spherical aberration to change the bokeh in front of and behind the focal plane. The Minolta/Sony STF 135mm f/2.8 [T4.5] (with STF standing for smooth trans focus) is a lens specifically designed to produce pleasing bokeh. It is possible to choose between two diaphragms: one with 9 and another with 10 blades. An apodization filter is used to soften the aperture edges which results in a smooth defocused area with gradually fading circles. Those qualities made it the only lens of this kind on the market from its introduction in 1999 to 2014. In 2014 Fujifilm announced a lens utilizing a similar apodization filter in the Fujinon XF 56mm F1.2 R APD lens. Sony added the Sony FE 100mm F2.8 STF GM OSS in 2017. The 'Sigma YS System Focusing' 135mm f/2.8 also has an extra manually-moved component, intended to compensate for aberration at close-focus distances. It can be re-purposed for defocus control. In 2015, Meyer Optik USA Inc. launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce the Trioplan f2.9/50, a new lens based on one originally produced by Hugo Meyer & Co.; both lenses exhibit a characteristic \\"soap-bubble\\" bokeh. The use of anamorphic lenses will cause bokeh to appear differently along the horizontal and vertical axes of the lens, becoming ellipsoidal compared to those in a spherical lens. In 2016, Apple Inc. released the iPhone 7 Plus which can take pictures with \\"Portrait Mode\\" (a bokeh like effect). Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 has a similar effect available. Both of these phones use dual cameras to detect edges and create a \\"depth map\\" of the image, which the phone uses to blur the out-of-focus portions of the photo. Other phones, like the Google Pixel, only use a single camera and machine learning to create the depth map. In 2017, Vivo released a smartphone with dual front lenses for selfies with bokeh. The first, a 20 MP lens, uses a 1/2.78\\" sensor with f/2.0 aperture, while the second, an 8 MP f/2.0 lens, captures depth information. Bokeh can be made with a combination of both lenses, and shots can be refocused even after they are captured, adding bokeh effects with different depths. In early 2018, the Honor 9 Lite smartphone was released with quad cameras (two dual-lens). Both the front and back cameras have a 13MP main lens and a 2MP lens for capturing bokeh depth information.

Unlike conventional convolution, this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and ‚Äì at least in principle ‚Äì has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground. Also, bokeh is not just any blur. To a first approximation, defocus blur is convolution by a uniform disk, a more computationally intensive operation than the \\"standard\\" Gaussian blur; the former produces sharp circles around highlights whereas the latter is a much softer effect. Diffraction may alter the effective shape of the blur. Some graphics editors have a filter to do this, usually called \\"Lens Blur.\\" An alternative mechanical mechanism has been proposed for generating bokeh in small aperture cameras such as compacts or cellphone cameras, called image destabilisation, in which both the lens and sensor are moved in order to maintain focus at one focal plane, while defocusing nearby ones. This effect currently generates blur in only one axis. Some advanced digital cameras have bokeh features which take several images with different apertures and focuses and then manually compose them afterward to one image. More advanced systems of bokeh use a hardware system of 2 sensors, one sensor to take photo as usual while other ones record depth information. Bokeh effect and refocusing can then be applied to an image after the photo is taken. Other applications In 2009, a research group at MIT Media Lab showed that the bokeh effect can be used to make imperceptibly small barcodes, or bokodes. By using barcodes as small as 3 mm with a small lens over them, if the barcode is viewed out of focus through an ordinary camera focused at infinity, the resulting image is large enough to scan the information in the barcode.Mohan, A., Woo, G, Hiura, S, Smithwick, Q, Raskar, R.

It was created by Alan Bateman and commenced broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to Kangaroo Point, New South Wales, where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called Refuge, but the name was changed to the \\"friendlier\\" title of Home and Away once production began. The show premiered with a ninety- minute pilot episode (subsequently in re-runs and on VHS known as Home and Away: The Movie). Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and Home and Away has become the second longest-running drama series in Australian television. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm. 'Home and Away' follows the lives and loves of the residents in Summer Bay, a fictional seaside town in New South Wales. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family ‚Äì Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa (Vanessa Downing), and their five foster children, Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) ‚Äì who moved from the city into the Summer Bay House, where they assumed the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). Home and Away was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, rape, drug and alcohol addiction, drug overdose and attempted suicide. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its restricted time slot. Palm Beach in Sydney's Northern Beaches district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern. Home and Away has been sold to over eighty countries around the world, making it one of Australia's most successful media exports. In the UK, it and Neighbours, another Australian soap opera, are the most popular of the genre that are filmed internationally, with them both airing twice daily on Channel 5. It is one of the highest-rating shows on RT√â Television in Ireland and TVNZ 2 in New Zealand. In Australia, Home and Away is the most awarded program at the Logie Awards, with a total of forty-six wins, including Best Drama Program. Some cast members have won several other awards such as the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television, Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor, and Most Popular Actress. In 2015, Home and Away was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. History After the Seven Network cancelled their soap opera Neighbours on 12 July 1985 due to low ratings, rival network Ten picked it up and turned it into a success.Mercado 2004, p. 205. A couple of years later, Seven's head of drama, Alan Bateman, became desperate to get back into the soap market and began to work out how to launch another soap that was not a copy of Neighbours.Mercado 2004, p. 251. While on a trip to Kangaroo Point, New South Wales with his family, Bateman began talking to locals who were \\"up in arms\\" over the construction of a foster home for children from the city. Seeing the degree of conflict the \\"influx of parentless children on a tight- knit community\\" was having, Bateman came away with the idea for a new serial. He explained \\"Nobody in the community wanted them to move in and I began to wonder how streetwise city kids would adapt to the new lifestyle. Suddenly I thought, there is my slice of life in a community.\\" Bateman began outlining the storyline and set the serial in the fictional town of Summer Bay. While Seven Network executives were unconvinced by the idea, audience research was positive. The soap opera was initially called Refuge, but the name was changed to the \\"friendlier\\" title of Home and Away once production began. Home and Away has since become the second-longest drama series in Australian television after Neighbours. During the show's first season in 1988, a rape storyline for the character Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) outraged the public and a protest erupted, as viewers deemed it an inappropriate subject to be covering in an early evening time slot. In 2002, several former characters such as Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Blake Dean (Les Hill) and Sophie Simpson (Rebekah Elmaloglou) returned for a special storyline to mark the 150th anniversary of settlement in Summer Bay. The storyline featured a majority of the cast boarded onto a ferry boat for a night cruise; however, a massive storm ruined the celebrations, leading the boat to sink. In July 2005, Home and Away celebrated its 4000th episode, which saw many former cast members return for Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) surprise 60th birthday party. In March 2007, the commercial television industry's Annual Code Complaint Report revealed that Home and Away was the eighth most complained about show on Australian television, and the only drama series in the top ten complaint list. From 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, there were 23 written complaints about the show as viewers thought it was inappropriate for it to be shown in its 7:00 pm timeslot. In March 2009, it was alleged that Seven had agreed to censor a then-upcoming lesbian kiss scene between Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) and Joey Collins (Kate Bell), after receiving many complaints from conservative groups and mothers who did not want their children exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Seven's head of creative drama, Bevan Lee, later confirmed that the censorship allegations were in fact false and that the scene would still go to air as planned. Home and Away celebrated its 21st year in production in Sydney on 23 July 2009. The mayor of Sydney's Pittwater Council presented cast members with the key to Palm Beach, the filming location for the show. At the end of 2011, Cameron Welsh left his role as the series producer. Welsh previously played the character Mitch McColl from 1999 until 2001 and then became the series producer for Home and Away in 2007. Former All Saints producer Lucy Addario took over as series producer in January 2012. In August 2012, Home and Aways official Australian Facebook page reached one million likes, becoming the first Australian television show to reach this milestone. The Facebook page was established in November 2009 and is followed by fans mostly in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. In 2013, Home and Away celebrated its 25th anniversary and former cast member Kate Ritchie (Sally Fletcher) returned for a special storyline to coincide with the celebrations. For the first time in the show's history, Home and Away aired a two-hander episode, featuring only the characters Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen) and Darryl \\"Brax\\" Braxton (Steve Peacocke), on 14 February 2016. Settings Palm Beach in Sydney's Northern Beaches district has been used to represent Summer Bay since Home and Away began in 1988. Home and Away is set in Summer Bay, a fictional seaside town of New South Wales. Locations within the town include the beach, a high school, diner, bait shop, garage and a surf club, which includes a gym, small kiosk and an upstairs restaurant. Characters in the show live at surrounding neighbouring areas such as the Summer Bay House, Summer Bay Caravan Park, Beach House, The Farmhouse, Pier Flat, and Saxon Avenue. Other fictional towns mentioned and sometimes seen in Home and Away are Mangrove River and Yabbie Creek. Palm Beach in Sydney's Northern Beaches district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since Home and Away began in 1988. It has since become popular with tourists, and tours to the show's exterior sets at Palm Beach run throughout the year. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach and at Fisherman's Beach in Collaroy. Interior scenes for the show were filmed at the Seven Network's Sydney studios in Epping until 2010. Following the closure of these studios in early 2010, the interiors are now filmed at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern. The Jackeroo Ranch estate in Kenthurst had been used for the exterior sets of the Summer Bay House and Caravan Park since 1988. After both sets were destroyed by a bushfire in December 2002, the caravan park set was moved and filmed at other locations such as the Waratah Park Earth Sanctuary between 2007‚Äì09 and the Lane Cove River Tourist Park between 2010‚Äì14. A replica of the Summer Bay House was rebuilt in its original location at the Kenthurst estate several years later, with the exception of a grey roof instead of a red one. The caravan park set moved back to the estate after the house was rebuilt, and both exterior sets made their on-screen returns in 2015. The Summer Bay House is the only house to still be seen on screen since the pilot episode. Aside from New South Wales, Home and Away has also filmed scenes in other states of Australia. In May 2012, the show filmed scenes at Flinders Ranges and Nilpena Station in South Australia for a storyline in which Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) was kidnapped and taken to the outback by Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway). The following month, Home and Away filmed scenes in Melbourne for the second time. In November 2014, the show filmed an episode at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra with several cast members, as a tribute to the Anzac Centenary. The episode centered around Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher), \\"who becomes upset with the younger generation's perceived lack of respect for Anzac Day, and joins the school trip to Canberra to visit the War Memorial.\\" Outside of Australia, Home and Away has filmed in Hawaii once and in the UK three times. Broadcasting In Australia, Home and Away currently airs on the Seven Network at 7:00 pm from Mondays to Thursdays, going up against rival current affairs shows A Current Affair on the Nine Network, and The Project on Network Ten. The show is on air for approximately 45 weeks each year. Each season is usually broadcast from January or February and concludes with the season finale in November or December, as it goes off air for two months during the Christmas and New Year period. All aired episodes shown during the week are available to watch on the Seven Network's 7plus app, as part of their catch up TV service. They are also broadcast in an omnibus edition each Sunday on Seven's digital multichannel 7Two. When the show first began in 1988, it aired at 5:30 pm in Adelaide, at 6:00 pm in Melbourne and Sydney, at 6:30 pm in Brisbane, and at 7:00 pm in Perth. In January 1992, Seven moved Home and Away to the 7:00 pm timeslot across the network. On 3 November 2009, 7Two began airing repeat episodes of the show from the very beginning at 9:30 am, before moving to 9:00 am. Since its premiere, the show had been screened as a 22-minute episode each weeknight. However, beginning in March 2013, Better Homes and Gardens began replacing Home and Away on Fridays to make way for Seven's AFL coverage. Friday's episodes of Home and Away now air on Thursdays at 7:30 pm. As of 2018, Home and Away currently airs sporadically, with episodes consisting from four to six episodes per week. Since 2000, Home and Away has ceased broadcast mid- season for two weeks during the Olympic Games and the episode to screen prior to this is referred to as an 'Olympic cliffhanger'. An Olympic cliffhanger episode would usually involve increased drama, with the peak of a storyline, similar to a season finale episode, and the outcome of the cliffhanger to conclude after the Olympics. Olympic cliffhangers have been broadcast in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2016, with the exclusion of 2012, as the Seven Network did not have the rights to televise the 2012 London Olympics; it will do so in 2021. In addition to this, Home and Away took a transmission break on 3 April 2018 in order to broadcast the 2018 Commonwealth Games, and returned on 16 April 2018. On 22 March 2020, Home and Away suspended production over the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, it was initially stated that the show would continue filming, the decision was later made to halt production, despite neither the cast or crew testing positive for the virus. Furthermore, on 23 March, the show was removed from Seven's schedule to make way for extended coverage on the pandemic. Home and Away returned in its usual timeslot on 13 April. On 12 May 2020, it was announced that the show will recommence production following the nine-week suspension. Although filming will be only limited to the studio, it is set to resume on 25 May. Storylines were rewritten to limit close contact between the actors. =International= Home and Away has been sold to over 80 countries around the world, making it one of Australia's successful media exports. In the United Kingdom, Home and Away was first broadcast on ITV from 11 February 1989 until 8 June 2000.(LWT and Yorkshire started the series a day later) Home and Away was shown twice a day on ITV, with a lunchtime showing and a tea time repeat; many regions aired it at around 5:10 pm, while others at 6:00 pm or even 6:30 pm. The show attracted up to eight million viewers, making it one of ITV's top 30 rated programmes. It also helped boost audiences for ITV's regional and early evening news bulletins. During the show's last year on ITV, Home and Away attracted an average audience of 4.4 million for its early-evening repeats. In February 2000, it was announced that Home and Away would be moving to rival Channel 5 after they bought the rights to the show in a ¬£40m auction deal. ITV reportedly offered twice the amount by Channel 5, but the Seven Network in Australia were swayed by Channel 5's commitment to the long-term future of the show in a deal of more than five years. After its run on ITV ended, Home and Away went off air for 12 months as ITV had an exclusivity clause that prevented any other broadcaster from airing the show for a year. After a delay in screening, Home and Away made its debut on Channel 5 on 16 July 2001. Channel 5 currently airs Home and Away at 1:15 pm each week day, with a repeat at 6:00 pm. UK viewers are able to catch up with episodes on 5* and online via Demand 5. From July 2018, Home and Away is available for catch up on Paramount Network, a channel operated by Channel 5. As of May 2020, the UK are five weeks behind Australian transmission. In September 2019, the pilot episode and the first 199 episodes of the first season were made available to stream on Amazon Prime Video in the United Kingdom. In November 2019, the final 29 episodes of the first season, and the first 171 episodes of the second season were added to the service, however, they are listed as \\"Season 2\\". In Ireland, Home and Away is broadcast on RT√â Television at 1:30 pm on RT√â One and at 6:30 pm on RT√â2 each weekday. A repeat of the week's episodes is aired on Saturdays and Sundays on RT√â2. Viewers in the Republic of Ireland are also able to catch up with episodes on the RT√â Player. Home and Away is one of RT√â's most popular drama series. It was the most watched programme of 2014 on the RT√â Player with over four million viewers. As of 2014, the show is available to view in Northern Ireland on 5STAR daily at 3.30pm and 6.30pm as well as the regular Channel Five airings. The show is however blocked in Northern Ireland via the SKY platform on both RTE1 and RTE2, yet it remains available on Irish platform Saorview for both Irish and Northern Irish viewers. In New Zealand, Home and Away is broadcast on TVNZ2, with five episodes aired between 3.30pm to 6pm broadcasting every Sunday. A repeat of the episodes are spread across Monday to Friday, shown at 11:00 am each weekday. The TVNZ website also offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service. Home and Away is one of New Zealand's most popular TV series and is one of TVNZ 2's highest-rating shows. The show had previously aired on TV3 since 2002, where it consistently won high ratings for TV3 and helped boost audiences for their 6pm news bulletin. However, on 5 July 2013, the show's European distributor Endemol cancelled its agreement with TV3, causing them to lose the right to broadcast Home and Away. In the United States, Home and Away was first shown briefly on the FX cable network from the channel's launch on 1 June 1994 to February 1995. Over two decades later, the show began streaming on the subscription service Hulu on 2 March 2015, beginning with the 2015 season. The service no longer receives new episodes, although the complete twenty-eighth season is currently available. YouTube has certain episodes available to watch as reruns. Popularity and viewership The launch of Home and Away in 1988 was hoped to help boost the Seven Network's early evening ratings which had been underperforming in previous years. However, the show struggled to attract high ratings, particularly when compared to rival soap opera Neighbours, which was a huge ratings success at the time. By the end of 1988, Home and Aways ratings had improved. In January 1992, when Neighbours' high-rating era was over, Seven moved Home and Away to the 7:00 pm timeslot, putting both shows up against each other. This caused Network Ten to move Neighbours to the 6.30 pm timeslot two months later. During the early 2000s, Home and Away was averaging 1.3 million viewers and in 2007, viewing figures rose to 1.4 million. However, by the end of the decade, the ratings had dropped to an average of 1.1 million viewers. During the early 2010s, viewing figures had further decreased to between 800,000 and 1 million an episode. In 2012, Home and Away was averaging 981,000 viewers, down from 1.039 million in 2011 and 1.021 million in 2010. In 2015, the show began going through a serious ratings decline. A July 2015 report revealed that the ratings were down 14% compared to the first six months of 2014, which translates to about 140,000 fewer viewers per episode. On 6 July 2015, Home and Away ranked 16th in OzTAM's overnight ratings with 750,000 viewers. The following night, the show fell to an even lower figure of 701,000 viewers. A writer for the Australian Associated Press stated that one of the reasons for the ratings decline could be \\"the viewing habits of Gen Y, which the show is aimed at, have changed dramatically in recent times thanks to the launch of streaming services, Netflix, Stan and Presto. The exact age demographic that Home and Away targets are the same people who do not subscribe to appointment viewing. They prefer to watch shows when they want and don't want to be dictated to by the commercial networks.\\" A Seven spokeswoman commented that Home and Away was still performing well on digital and social platforms and that the overnight ratings were not the only measure of the show's success. In 2019, Home and Away returned at the later date of 18 February, after the summer series of cricket concluded. Pippa Doyle of 96FM reported that declining ratings in 2018 and Seven's decision to push the show back had created doubt about its future on the network, and whether or not a timeslot change or a move to a multichannel was likely. The season returned to a series low of 620,000 viewers and ranked 13th for the night. The following night, the viewing figure fell to 581,000 and the show ranked 10th for the night. The first triple bill on 21 February pulled in 577,000 viewers and ranked 8th for the evening. The ratings for the triple bill episodes continued to fall from 524,000 to 414,000 viewers, and on 28 March 2019, the triple bill pulled in a new series low of 383,000 viewers for a five city metro figure and ranked 14th for the night. April 2019 saw a slight rise in the viewing figures; the first episode of the month drew in 740,000 viewers and ranked 9th for that night. The triple bill episodes continued to receive low ratings until the Thursday, 9 May episodes, which improved with 617,000 viewers. The following week's triple bill saw a further rise with 627,000 viewers, while the episodes broadcast on 30 May received 638,000 viewers and ranked at 7th place for the evening. The 2020 season return saw a series low for a premiere with only 548,000 tuning in. =Cancellation rumour= In July 2019, it was announced that Home and Away could be facing cancellation due to declining ratings. Network executives are currently considering the show's future as pressure is on the Seven Network to make drastic changes to the schedule before 2020. The series will likely be losing its 7pm timeslot in favour of reality TV which has been dominating Australian television more recently. Despite the drop in viewing figures, Home and Away remains one of the highest- rated drama series in Australia and is significantly more popular within streaming and catch-up services. One option is to move the series to a later timeslot on the Seven Network, following the reality shows, in order to explore more adult oriented storylines, while another option is to premiere five episodes each Friday on 7Plus and replay over the following week on 7Two. In response to the cancellation news, Lynne McGranger claimed that she hadn't heard that the show was being cancelled and commented that \\"I'm seeing all this stuff but I honestly have heard nothing. It may be true.... but then again I apparently was definitely leaving the Bay 18 months or so ago.\\" It was said that rumours began circulating when TV Blackbox posted the article and stated that the show was to move to a new timeslot and that it performs better on catch-up and demand which was believed to be a misunderstanding when tabloids reported that the show was close to its end. On 8 July 2019, in an article for New Idea, it was confirmed that the rumours were in fact untrue. A Seven Network spokesperson said that \\"These reports are complete rubbish\\". The rumour started with claims from TV Blackbox which led to a number of reports circulating within the UK press. New Idea went on to mention that Home and Away remains one of Australia's highest rated dramas and will remain on screen for the foreseeable future. Storylines Home and Aways storylines have ranged from mild to serious issues throughout its run. While the central stories revolve around fostering children, family and teenage problems, school problems and romances, the series has covered several controversial, adult- themed and detailed issues not suitable for young audiences, despite its early evening time of 7:00 pm. Storylines covered include abortion, accidental death, adultery, adoption, alcoholism, amnesia, amputation, arson, autism, bereavement, brain aneurysm, bulimia (anorexia), bullying, cancer, cage fighting, career problems, child abuse, cults, cyberbullying, domestic violence, depression, drink driving, drug overdose, drug trafficking and drug use, gambling addiction, health problems, hit-and-runs, HIV and AIDS, homosexuality, Huntington's disease, incest, miscarriage, murder, imprisonment, kidnapping, marriage problems, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), paedophilia, phantom pregnancy, post-natal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, prostitution, racism, rape, revenge porn, robbery, self-harm, sex, sexual grooming, shootings (including drive-by shootings), stabbings, stalking, stroke, SIDS (cot death), stillbirth, suicide, surrogacy, teacher- student relationships, teenage pregnancy, terminal illness, and witness protection. The show has also featured many natural disaster storylines, including a cyclone, storm, flood, landslide, earthquake, and bushfires. There have also been several storylines involving car, bus, plane and boating accidents. Furthermore, in addition to the show featuring scenes of moderate to strong violence in past episodes, the special episode, Home and Away: All or Nothing, which became available for online streaming in January 2017, was intended for \\"adult-only\\" viewing as it was described as the most violent episode of the entire series, as it contains scenes of strong violence. Rating and restrictions Since 1988, Home and Away has dealt with some controversial issues, despite being broadcast in a G-rated time block. In 2007, the show breached broadcasting rules when they aired a number of episodes featuring Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) involved with pole-dancing in the G classification, as the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said that these episodes should have been rated PG as they contained sexual scenes and references. Since 2008, every subsequent episode has been broadcast under the PG classification and often continues to exceed the rating. A 2010 episode which featured Martha McKenzie engaging in a sexual scene with Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) on a kitchen table was deemed \\"too raunchy\\" by a television watchdog in New Zealand, as the series was aired in a G-rated timeslot at 5:30 pm on TV3. From 2015, The Early Years episodes (G-rated in original airings) which broadcast on weekday mornings on 7Two have been re-rated PG. Characters Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart) is currently the only remaining original cast member in Home and Away. When Home and Away began in 1988, it initially focused on the Fletcher family ‚Äì Tom (Roger Oakley) and his wife Pippa (Vanessa Downing), and their five foster children, Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) ‚Äì who relocated from the city to live in the seaside town of Summer Bay. At the end of the first episode, Tom and Pippa take in their sixth foster child Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). The Fletchers bought the Summer Bay Caravan Park and moved into the Summer Bay House. They quickly built strong friendships with the locals, Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher), Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn) and Neville (Frank Lloyd) and Floss McPhee (Sheila Kennelly), whilst having a bitter rivalry with school headmaster Donald Fisher) (Norman Coburn) While Home and Away features a mix of young cast members and older, more experienced actors, the show has always had a definite youth focus, with the younger characters dominating much of the storylines. Many of the cast have spent several years on Home and Away, including original cast member Judy Nunn who left the series in 2000 after 12 years playing the co-owner of Summer Bay's diner. Other original cast members Norman Coburn played high school principal Donald Fisher until 2003, and Kate Ritchie departed in 2008 after 20 years playing Sally Fletcher. Both Coburn and Ritchie along with Ray Meagher (Alf Stewart) entered the 2002 Guinness World Records as the longest-serving actors in an Australian drama series. Meagher now holds that record alone and he is the only remaining original cast member in the show. Meagher along with Lynne McGranger (Irene Roberts), Ada Nicodemou (Leah Patterson-Baker) and Emily Symons (Marilyn Chambers) are the longest-serving cast members currently in Home and Away. In 2010, Georgie Parker joined the cast of Home and Away as Alf's daughter Roo Stewart, originally played by Justine Clarke in 1988‚Äì89. Alf and Roo are currently the only two original characters in the series. =Celebrity guest appearances= Throughout the years, Home and Away has featured several guest appearances from celebrities such as John Farnham, Johanna Griggs, Sia, Michael Palin, Ian Thorpe, Lleyton Hewitt, Paulini, Nick Grimshaw, Eliza Doolittle, Ed Sheeran, Jessica Mauboy and Atomic Kitten. Theme song The theme song to Home and Away was written by Mike Perjanik. There have been nine different versions of the theme song used throughout the years. The lyrics remained the same since the show's inception, but a number of verses were gradually cut back over the years due to time restrictions. The original version was sung by Karen Boddington and Mark Williams, and was used from 1988 until mid-1995. Their version was released as a single in the UK in 1989 and peaked at number 73 on the UK Singles Chart. A new version performed by Doug Williams and Erana Clark debuted in 1995 and the opening theme was shortened in 1996; this version remained until 1999. From 2000 to 2003, the theme song to Home and Away was sung by The Robertson Brothers and it was the first version to use only male vocals. A 30-second updated version by The Robertson Brothers was used from 2004 to 2006. In January 2007, a new version was introduced and performed by Israel Cannan, who played the character Wazza in the show. After Cannan's version received many complaints from fans, the Seven Network decided to re-record the theme song in April 2007 with vocals provided by Luke Dolahenty. A shorter, 15-second version sung by Dolahenty and Tarryn Stokes debuted in 2009. From 2010 until 2017, the Home and Away theme song was not used in the opening titles and was replaced by a short instrumental version. However, Dolahenty and Stokes' version was still used in the closing credits for international broadcasts. In 2018, two new eight- second versions of the theme song made a return to the opening titles after an eight-year absence. One version is sung by a male vocalist, while the other version is sung by a female vocalist; in the opening titles, both only sing the last two lines of the theme: \\"closer each day, Home and Away\\". An extended 30-second version by the male vocalist was uploaded onto the Home and Away website. Opening titles The Home and Away opening titles sequence was initially used to introduce the regular characters in the show. The sequences often featured the characters in couple shots or with family and friends, and showed them in familiar settings around Summer Bay such as the beach. The titles for the show's earlier years featured black brush stroke cutouts around the character shots. 2004 saw Home and Away introduce new picture frame-style opening titles, with characters shown posing in and out of large picture frames in front of beach backgrounds. In January 2007, the show debuted new opening titles along with a new version of the theme song. The picture-frame style was still used, but this time the titles featured framed pictures of the characters. In 2009, the opening was reduced to 15 seconds and the characters were removed from the titles for the first time in Home and Aways history. They were replaced by a large photo collage showing various locations around Summer Bay. The decision to remove the cast and shorten the titles was due to time restrictions. Since then, many viewers in Australia and the UK have wanted the full-length title sequence with the cast to return. From 2013 until 2017, Home and Away used a series of five-second opening titles, which changed every week. The various titles mostly featured scenes of bikini-clad women and shirtless men with surfboards at the beach. In 2018, a new series of eight- second titles were introduced along with the return of the show's theme song. The new titles, which currently change during each week, mostly feature two men or two women running down to the ocean for a surf. A 30-second version of the titles, not aired on Australian television, was released on the Home and Away website. Awards and nominations Home and Away has received many awards and nominations throughout the years. The show has won 46 Logie Awards from 153 nominations, making it the most awarded program in Logie history. In 2015, Home and Away was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. The show has also won twelve Australian Writers' Guild Awards and five Australian Directors Guild Awards. Merchandise and spin-offs Since 1988, Home and Away has generated a range of merchandise, including books, magazines, VHS tapes, DVDs and soundtracks. Various annuals and books about the show and its cast and characters were released in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 2003 and 2005, several fictional books by Leon F. Saunders and Jane Anderson were released and based on characters from Home and Away. Episodes of the show have been released on several VHS and DVDs. Home and Away: The Movie was the first VHS released in 1989 and contained the 90-minute pilot episode. Another VHS tape, Home and Away: The Official Summer Bay Special, was released in 1996. It celebrated 2,000 episodes of the show and looked back at memorable moments throughout its earlier years. Home and Away: Secrets and the City and Home and Away: Hearts Divided were the first DVDs released in October 2003, and both contained exclusive episodes that were never aired on television. Two further DVDs, Home and Away: Romances and Home and Away: Weddings were released in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively, and featured clips from the most popular romances and weddings in the series' history. Romances featured the pilot episode, while Weddings featured two episodes containing Leah and Vinnie's wedding as a bonus feature. Four soundtrack albums were released between 1996 and 2003 that featured music used on the show as well songs from some of the cast members. Home and Away has also produced several spin-off episodes. headLand was a spin-off series focusing on a university. It ran from November 2005 until January 2006, when it was cancelled due to low ratings. In 2013, the show launched their first webisode series titled Home and Away Extras, which introduced new characters Andy (Tai Hara) and Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher) before they appeared on-air. The four-part websisode series was released on the show's Yahoo!7 website from 7 August 2013. On 19 August 2015, it was announced that former cast members Dan Ewing (Heath Braxton) and Lisa Gormley (Bianca Scott) would be returning for a special spin-off episode titled Home and Away: An Eye for an Eye. The episode was commissioned specially for the local streaming service Presto and did not air on the Seven Network. It centred around the Braxton family and was a feature- length episode running for over an hour. Home and Away: An Eye for an Eye was made available to watch on Presto from 9 December 2015. Following the success of Home and Away: An Eye for An Eye, it was announced on 6 May 2016 that two more feature-length episodes had been commissioned. The first episode became available on 19 December 2016 and is titled Home and Away: Revenge. The second special, Home and Away: All or Nothing, became available for viewing on 26 January 2017. From 25 November 2019, a web television series called Home and Away: Christmas in Summer Bay will begin airing weekly on video on demand and catch up TV service My5 in the UK, as the show takes its annual Christmas break. The series is presented by former Home and Away actor Jason Smith, who interviews the show's cast members at various Summer Bay locations.

She published under the pen name H.D. Hilda was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1886, and grew up just outside Philadelphia in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, and attended Bryn Mawr College. She moved to London in 1911, where she played a central role within the then-emerging Imagist movement. Young and charismatic, she was championed by the modernist poet Ezra Pound, who was instrumental in building her career. From 1916 to 1917, she acted as the literary editor of the Egoist journal, while her poetry appeared in the English Review and the Transatlantic Review. During World War I, H.D. suffered the death of her brother and the breakup of her marriage to the poet Richard Aldington,Featherstone, Simon. \\"War Poetry: An Introductory Reader (Critical Readers in Theory & Practice)\\".

Imagist authority Glenn Hughes wrote that 'her loneliness cries out from her poems'.Hughes, Glenn, Imagism & the Imagists, Stanford University Press, 1931 She had a deep interest in Ancient Greek literature, and her poetry often borrowed from Greek mythology and classical poets. Her work is noted for its incorporation of natural scenes and objects, which are often used to evoke a particular feeling or mood. She befriended Sigmund Freud during the 1930s, and became his patient in order to understand and express her bisexuality, her residual war trauma, her writing, and her spiritual experiences.Bertram, Vicki. \\"Kicking Daffodils: Twentieth-century Women Poets\\".

She attended Philadelphia's Friends' Central High School, at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was to play a major role both in her private life and her emergence as a writer.

In summer 1912, the three poets declared themselves the \\"three original Imagists\\", and set out their principles as: #Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective. #To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation. #As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in the sequence of a metronome.Lan, Feng. \\"Ezra Pound and Confucianism: Remaking Humanism in the Face of Modernity\\".

Close to the end of the war, H.D. met the wealthy English novelist Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman). They lived together until 1946, and although both took numerous other partners, Bryher remained her lover for the rest of H.D.'s life. In 1919, H.D. came close to death when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington‚Äîalthough the father was not Aldington, but Gray‚Äîwhile suffering from war influenza.Friedman, 9 During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died.

During this time, H.D. wrote The Gift, a memoir of her childhood and family life in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which reflects on people and events in her background that helped shape her as a writer.Mandel, Charlotte \\"H.D.'s The Gift \\". English Literature in Transition 1880‚Äì1920, September 1999. 344‚Äì48. Retrieved on October 6, 2007. The Gift was eventually published in 1960 and 1982.However the 1982 edition omits one of the original 7 chapters and heavily edits portions of the other 6. See Morris, 147 She also wrote Trilogy, published as The Walls do not Fall (1944), Tribute to the Angels (1945) and The Flowering of the Rod (1946). The opening lines of The Walls do not Fall clearly and immediately signal H.D.'s break with her earlier work: After the war, H.D. and Bryher no longer lived together, but remained in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, in the spring of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent the rest of her life in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt.Stanford Friedman, Susan. The Emergence of H.D. The Emergence of H.D. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987. 20 At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal. =Later life and death= During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a considerable amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952 and 1954), an examination of a male-centred epic poetry from a feminist point of view. She used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself.Twitchell-Waas, Jeffrey. \\"Seaward: H.D.'s 'Helen in Egypt' as a response to Pound's 'Cantos' \\". Twentieth Century Literature Volume 44, Number 4, Winter 1998, pp. 464‚Äì483. Retrieved on October 7, 2007. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy, being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.Sword, Helen.

He was the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party from 1993 to 2011. From 2011 to 2016, he served as Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Diplomatic Appointments and Canada's representative to the Ismaili Imamat from 2014 to 2016.Diplomatic Appointments Early life Campbell was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. His father, Charles Gordon (Chargo) Campbell, was a physician and an Assistant Dean of Medicine at the University of British Columbia, until his suicide in 1961, when Gordon was 13. His mother Peg was a kindergarten assistant at University Hill Elementary School. Charles and his wife, Peg, had four children. Gordon grew up in West Point Grey and went to Stride Elementary, and University Hill Secondary School where he was student council president. He was accepted by Dartmouth College, an Ivy League institution in New Hampshire; he had received a scholarship and a job offer so he could afford fees.  Later life  Campbell intended to study medicine but was persuaded by three English professors to shift his focus to English and urban management, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. At Dartmouth, in 1969, he received a $1,500 Urban Studies Fellowship that made it possible for him to work in Vancouver's city government. At that time Campbell met Art Phillips, a city councilor and future mayor of Vancouver. After graduating from university that year, Campbell and Nancy Chipperfield were married in New Westminster on July 4, 1970. Under the Canadian University Service Overseas program, they went to Nigeria to teach. There he coached basketball and track and field and launched literacy initiatives. Campbell was accepted to Stanford to pursue a master's degree in education, but the couple instead returned to Vancouver where Campbell entered law school at UBC and Nancy completed her education degree. Campbell's law education was short-lived; he soon returned to the City of Vancouver to work for Art Phillips on his mayoral campaign. When Phillips was elected in 1972, Campbell became his executive assistant, a job he held until 1976., source: Maclean's, 1999 When, at 28 years old, he left Mayor Phillips's office, Campbell went to work for Marathon Realty as a project manager. In 1976 Geoffrey, the Campbells' first child, was born. In 1978, the Campbells bought a house in Point Grey, which was their home for the next 26 years. From 1975 to 1978 he pursued a Master of Business Administration degree at Simon Fraser University. In 1979, Nancy Campbell gave birth to their second child, Nicholas. In 1981, Campbell left Marathon Realty and started his own business, Citycore Development Corporation. Despite the economic slowdown that affected Canada that year, his company was successful and constructed several buildings in Vancouver. After a two-year absence from civic political activities, Campbell became involved in the mayoral campaign of May Brown and was an active supporter of the Downtown Stadium for Vancouver committee. Although Brown was unsuccessful, Campbell and the committee continued promoting the stadium to revitalize False Creek, which at the time was polluted industrial land. The committee was eventually successful, as Premier Bill Bennett announced the Downtown Stadium project in 1980. Vancouver Councillor and Mayor Campbell was elected to Vancouver City Council in 1984 as a member of the Non-Partisan Association. He was then elected as Mayor of Vancouver for three successive terms from 1986 to 1993. Notable events in civic politics during that period included the development of the Expo Lands, the re- development of Yaletown, and the foundation of the Coal Harbour residential area. One of the most significant projects of his term was the construction of the new Vancouver Public Library. He also served as chair of the Greater Vancouver Regional District and president of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities. Liberal leader Campbell became leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1993 in a three-way race with Gordon Gibson, Jr. and Gordon Wilson, the incumbent party leader who had lost the confidence of his party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly the next year in a Vancouver-Quilchena by-election. In the 1996 campaign, Campbell was elected to the Vancouver-Point Grey riding, which he held until 2010. The Liberals entered the election leading in polls, due to a fundraising scandal in the NDP. His party gained 16 seats and won a slight plurality of the popular vote, but the NDP retained enough seats to continue a majority government. He stayed on as Leader of the Opposition, opposing New Democratic Party Premiers Glen Clark, Dan Miller and Ujjal Dosanjh. In May 2000, Campbell, along with Michael de Jong and Geoffrey Plant, brought a court case against the Nisga'a Nation, the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of British Columbia, parties to the first modern day Aboriginal Treaty in British Columbia, known as the Nisga'a Final Agreement. He and the other plaintiffs claimed that the treaty signed with the Nisga'a Nation was \\"in part inconsistent with the Constitution of Canada and therefore in part of no force and effect.\\" However, Justice Williamson dismissed the application, judging that the enacting legislation did \\"establish a treaty as contemplated by Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The legislation and the Treaty are constitutionally valid.\\"2000 BCSC 1123 Premier Glen Clark's government was beset by controversy, difficult economic and fiscal conditions and attacks on the NDP's building of the Fast Ferries, and charges against Clark in relation to casino licensing, known as Casinogate (Clark was eventually vindicated, though resigned his post because of the investigation). In the BC election of 2001 Campbell's Liberals defeated the two-term NDP incumbents, taking 77 of 79 seats in the legislature. This was the largest majority of seats, and the second-largest majority of the popular vote in BC history.Electoral History of British Columbia 1871‚Äì1986 First term as Premier=Tax= In 2001, Campbell campaigned on a promise to significantly reduce income taxes to stimulate the economy. A day after taking office, he reduced personal income tax for all taxpayers by 25 per cent across to every tax bracket. The government also introduced reductions in the corporate income tax, and eliminated the Corporation Capital Tax. =Spending= To finance the tax cuts and to balance the provincial budget, Campbell's first term was also noted for several measures of fiscal austerity such as reductions in welfare rolls and some social services, deregulation, sale of government assets (in particular the ferries built by the previous government during the Fast Ferry Scandal), reducing the size of the civil service, and closing government offices in certain areas. = BC Rail = In 2003, Campbell announced the sale of BC Rail, a publicly owned rail corporation, to the Canadian National Railway. This occurred even though he had promised not to sell the company as a campaign promise during the 2001 British Columbia election. In 1996, he had lost an election after promising to sell the company, leading some to allege that he had hidden his true plans to get elected in 2001, and \\"went back to his original plan\\" after winning the 2001 election. This sale was condemned as unfair by the losing bidders, and triggered charges based in information found during police raids on cabinet offices in a drug-related investigation in what is known as the BC Legislature Raids. =Education= The Campbell government passed legislation in August 2001 declaring education as an essential service, therefore making it illegal for educators to go on strike. This fulfilled a platform promise made in the election campaign. The government embarked upon the largest expansion of BC's post-secondary education system since the foundation of Simon Fraser University in 1965. In 2004, the government announced that 25,000 new post-secondary places would be established between 2004 and 2010. The Campbell government also lifted the six-year-long tuition fee freeze that was placed on BC universities and colleges by the previous NDP government. In 2005 a tuition limit policy was put in place, capping increases at the rate of inflation. =Environmental= Campbell made significant changes, including new Environmental Assessment Legislation, as well as controversial new aquaculture policies on salmon farming. In November 2002, His government passed the Forest and Range Practices Act which reversed many of the regulations previously introduced by the former New Democrat government. =First Nations= During the 2001 election, the BC Liberals also campaigned on a promise to hold a consultative referendum seeking a mandate from the general public to negotiate treaties with First Nations. In the spring of 2002, the government held the referendum.\\"B.C. treaty referendum\\" ‚Äì CBC, July 2, 2002 The referendum, led by Attorney General Geoff Plant, proposed eight questions that voters were asked to either support or oppose. Critics claimed the phrasing was flawed or biased toward a predetermined response. While some critics, especially First Nations and religious groups, called for a boycott of the referendum, by the May 15 deadline almost 800,000 British Columbians had cast their ballots. Critics called for a boycott of the referendum and First Nations groups collected as many ballots as possible so that they might be destroyed publicly. Of the ballots that were returned, over 80 per cent of participating voters agreeing to all eight proposed principles. Treaty negotiations resumed. In the lead-up to the 2005 election, Campbell discussed opening up a New Relationship with Aboriginal People. This position was directly opposite to his view of Aboriginal Treaties pursued in the 2000 Nisga'a Final Treaty court case, discussed above. The \\"New Relationship\\" became the foundation for agreements in principle that were made during the second term, but ultimately rejected by the membership of the First Nations involved. =Health care= In 2004, Campbell imposed an unprecedented 15% paycut to health care employees.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/back-to-work- legislation-imposes-15-pay-cut-on-health-care-staff/article18281516/ Early in its first term, without consulting with labour unions, then his government passed legislation (Bill 29, the Health and Social Services Delivery Improvement Act) that unilaterally amended labour agreements and required health authorities to contract out positions when savings could be predicted. This led to the privatization of more than 8,000 healthcare jobs.http://search.proquest.com/docview/242509433 These changes met resistance from many health care workers and resulted in a strike by some of them. This strike was ended by court order and amendments by the government on parts of the legislation. The unions took the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled in 2007 that the Act violated 'good faith' requirements for collective bargaining. Campbell government increased health funding by $3 billion during its first term in office to help meet the demand at hand and to increase wages for some health professionals. As well they increased the number of new nurse training spaces by 2,500, an increase of 62 percent. At the same time, it nearly doubled the doctors in training, and opened new medical training facilities in Victoria and Prince George. Wage rates for doctors and nurses increased in the Campbell government's first term. Nurses received a 23.5 percent raise while doctors received a 20.6 percent raise after arbitration. Doctors had threatened to go on strike due to the original Campbell plan to slash their fees, which was seen as a breach of contract, with the dispute being sent to arbitration. =Impaired driving= In January 2003, after visiting broadcaster Fred Latremouille, Campbell was arrested and pleaded no contest for driving under the influence of alcohol while vacationing in Hawaii. According to court records, Campbell's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit. In Hawaii, drunk driving is only a misdemeanour, whereas in Canada it is a Criminal Code offence. As is customary in the United States, Campbell's mugshot was provided to the media by Hawaii police. The image has proved to be a lasting personal embarrassment, frequently used by detractors and opponents. Campbell was fined $913 (US) and the court ordered him to take part in a substance abuse program, and to be assessed for alcoholism. A national anti-drinking and driving group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Canada called for Campbell to resign. Campbell refused. =Minimum wage= On November 1, 2001, the Campbell BC Liberals honoured the previous NDP government's legislation to increase the minimum wage to $8.00 per hour from $7.60, while at the same time authority was given so new entrants into the labour force could be paid $6 per hour, 25% lower than the minimum wage. In 2010, British Columbia had the lowest minimum wage amongst the 13 provinces and territories. Campbell's successor, Christy Clark, announced that the minimum wage would increase in three stages to begin on May 1, 2011. =2010 Winter Olympics= British Columbia won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics on July 2, 2003. This was a joint Winter Olympics bid by Vancouver and the ski resort of Whistler. Campbell attended the final presentations in Prague, the Czech Republic. On February 12, 2010, Campbell was in attendance at the opening ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and attended events during the games and was present at the closing ceremony. On April 23, 2010, Campbell received the Olympic Order from the Canadian Olympic Committee for being a dedicated proponent of the Olympic Movement. Second term as Premier In the May 17, 2005, election, Campbell and the BC Liberals won a second majority government with a reduced majority. =Economy= 430,000 new jobs had been created in B.C. since December 2001, the best job creation record in Canada at the time. In 2007, the economy created 70,800 more jobs, almost all full-time positions. By Spring 2007, unemployment had fallen to 4.0%, the lowest rate in 30 years. However, 40,300 jobs were lost in 2008, mostly in December (35,100), and unemployment rates sit at 7.8% as of July 2009, the same level they were at in July 2001. =Education= On October 7, 2005, following the successive imposition of contracts on BC teachers, British Columbia's teachers began an indefinite walk-out. Campbell having made striking illegal for teachers, educators referred to this as an act of civil disobedience. Despite fines and contempt charges, the teachers' walk-out lasted two weeks, and threatened to culminate in a general strike across the province. =Environmental= In 2008, Premier Campbell's government developed and entrenched in law the Climate Action Plan. The Plan is claimed by the government to be one of the most progressive plans to address greenhouse gas emissions in North America, due in part to the revenue-neutral carbon tax. Gordon Campbell told Tim Flannery that he introduced the carbon tax in British Columbia after reading his book The Weather Makers (2005).Tim Flannery, Atmosphere of Hope. Solutions to the Climate Crisis, Penguin Books, 2015, page 5 (). =First Nations= The Campbell government attempted to negotiate treaties with a number of First Nations in its second term. Final agreements in principle were signed with the Tsawwassen First Nation, Maa-nulth Treaty Society, and Lheidli T‚Äôenneh First Nations. The Tsawwassen Treaty was passed by the band's membership in a heavily contested and divisive referendum but came into effect on April 3, 2009.\\"Now and Everlasting\\", Terry Glavin, Vancouver Magazine, March 26, 2009 The Maa-nulth Treaty, which covers a group of Nuu-chah-nulth band governments, is pending ratification by the federal government while the Lheidli-T'enneh Treaty was rejected in the referendum held by that band. =Health care= The Campbell government launched the Conversation on Health, a province-wide consultation with British Columbians on their health care to lay the groundwork for changes to the principles of the Canada Health Act that were presented in the Fall of 2007. Third term as Premier Campbell in 2010 His government were re-elected in the May 12, 2009, election. Their share of total seats remained almost unchanged, as they won 49 seats in a new expanded 85-seat legislature. =BC Rail e-mail controversy= Some five years after the BC Legislature Raids, controversy arose when it was revealed that e-mails among Campbell, his staff, and other cabinet ministers may not have been deleted years ago as first claimed. An affidavit filed by Rosemarie Hayes, the B.C. government's manager in charge of information services, suggested that copies of the e-mails may have existed as recently as May 2009, but were ordered to have been destroyed at that time. On July 20, 2009, the Supreme Court of British Columbia judge conducting the Basi-Virk trial, Madam Justice Elizabeth Bennett, ordered Campbell and other top officials to turn over their e-mail records to the court by August 17. These were never located nor surrendered to the Court. =HST controversy= On July 23, 2009, Campbell announced that British Columbia would move towards a Harmonized Sales Tax, or HST. The new 12% sales tax would combine and replace the previous 5% Goods and Services Tax and 7% Provincial Sales Tax. The announcement was met with strong opposition from political opponents, news media, and opposition from most members of the public. However, the proposed tax received a positive reaction from the business community, strong supporters of the BC Liberals.> Much of the opposition stemmed from Campbell's perceived dishonesty about the HST as his government had said it was not on their radar prior to the election despite leaked emails revealing it was indeed on their radar, and the fact that it equated to a tax hike for several sectors. On August 24, representatives from the retail, resource, and film industries held a news conference to speak out in favour of harmonizing BC's sales taxes. In addition, sales tax harmonization has been hailed by the C.D. Howe Institute, a think tank, as being \\"crucial for B.C to maintain its economic competitiveness.\\" On June 11, 2010, Blair Lekstrom resigned as BC's Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, saying he was leaving both the cabinet and the caucus over a fundamental disagreement with the BC Liberals on the harmonized sales tax. A freedom of information request came to light on September 1, 2010, revealing that the BC Liberals had formed HST-related plans prior to the 2009 election‚Äîcontrary to their statements on the subject. Resignation On November 3, 2010, Campbell made a televised address to the public, announcing his intention to resign as Premier of British Columbia. The announcement was made after months of strong political opposition to the implementation of the HST, which saw Campbell's approval rating fall to only 9%, according to an Angus Reid poll, and led to rumours that he has lost support of some members of his cabinet. Another factor in his resignation was the ongoing BC Rail Scandal trial in which the Premier and other members of his cabinet and staff were due to face embarrassing cross-examination in relation to the Basi-Virk trial, which was called to a halt with an illegal plea bargain around the same time. On December 5, 2010, while answering questions from reporters, he \\"hinted strongly\\" that he will not stay on as an MLA after his successor as Liberal leader is chosen in February, according to Rod Mickleburgh of The Globe and Mail. Campbell resigned as premier on March 14, 2011, he was succeeded by Christy Clark but remained in party circles as \\"senior advisor\\". High Commissioner to the UK Rosemary Butler, the Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff, Wales. Campbell speaking at the Cambridge Union Society In late June 2011 it was reported that Campbell was to be named Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. On August 15, 2011, Campbell was formally announced to succeed the post. On September 15, 2011, Campbell officially became the Canadian High Commissioner in London. He represented Canadian interests throughout Britain until his term ended in 2016. Campbell was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 for his work on business partnership as the High Commissioner of Canada, and he remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who's Who publication. In January 2019, a former High Commission employee filed a sexual assault complaint with Scotland Yard alleging that Campbell groped her in 2013. A spokesperson for Campbell denied the allegation, saying the complaint was investigated and dismissed at the time. Honours On September 2, 2011, it was announced that Campbell would receive the Order of British Columbia, the second Premier to be a recipient.News  Order of BC Some believed his nomination contravened the legislation that prevented an elected official from being appointed while holding office. However, on September 7, 2011, Lance S. G. Finch, the Chief Justice of British Columbia and chair of the Order of BC Advisory Council declared that although his nomination package was received on March 10, 2011 (four days before his resignation as Premier), Campbell was appointed to the Order on September 2, 2011 at which time he was not an elected MLA. In 2014, Thompson Rivers University gave Campbell the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws due to his contributions to the founding of their newly opened law school. He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

A committed republican from 1795, he backed the coup d'√©tat of 18 Fructidor, (4 September 1797) and the following one on 18 brumaire, (9 November 1799). During the Consulat, in 1800 he became the leader of the Liberal Opposition. Having upset Napoleon and left France to go to Switzerland then to the Kingdom of Saxony, he nonetheless sided with Napoleon during the Hundred Days and became politically active again during the French Restoration. He was elected D√©put√© in 1818 and remained in post until his death in 1830. Head of the Liberal opposition, known as Ind√©pendants, he was one of the most notable orators of the Chamber of Deputies of France, as a proponent of the parliamentary system. During the July Revolution, he was a supporter of Louis Philippe I ascending the throne. He was the author of numerous essays on political and religious themes, and also wrote on romantic love, such as the autobiographical Le Cahier rouge (1807) which gives an account of his love for Madame de Sta√´l, whose prot√©g√© and collaborator he became, especially in the Coppet circle, and a successful novella, Adolphe (1816). He was a fervent classical liberal of the early 19th century.Benjamin Constant: French Liberal Extraordinaire, Mises InstituteCraiutu, A. (2012) A Virtue for Courageous Minds: Moderation in French Political Thought, 1748‚Äì1830, pp. 199, 202‚Äì03 He refined the concept of liberty, defining it as a condition of existence that allowed the individual to turn away interference from the state or society. His ideas influenced the Trienio Liberal movement in Spain, the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Portugal, the Greek War of Independence, the November uprising in Poland, the Belgian Revolution, and liberalism in Brazil and Mexico.Edmund Fawcett, Liberalism: The Life of an Idea (2nd ed. 2018) pp. 33‚Äì48 Biography Henri-Benjamin Constant was born in Lausanne to descendants of French Huguenot Protestants who had fled from Artois to Switzerland during the Huguenot Wars in the 16th century. His father, Jules Constant de Rebecque, served as a high-ranking officer in the Dutch States Army, like his grandfather, his uncle and his cousin Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque. When Constant's mother, Henriette-Pauline de Chandieu- Villars, died soon after his birth, both his grandmothers took care of him. Private tutors educated him in Brussels (1779) and in the Netherlands (1780). While at the Protestant University of Erlangen (1783), he gained access to the court of Duchess Sophie Caroline Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. He had to leave after an affair with a girl, and moved to the University of Edinburgh. There he lived at the home of Andrew Duncan and was befriended by James Mackintosh and Malcolm Laing.Benjamin Constant: philosophe, historien, romancier, homme d'√©tat, p. 38 When he left the city, he promised to pay back his gambling debts. In 1787, he returned to continental Europe, travelling on horseback through Scotland and England. In those years European nobility, with their prerogatives, come under heavy attack from those, like Constant, who were influenced by Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality. Constant's family criticized him for leaving out part of his last name. In Paris, at the home of Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard he became acquainted with Isabelle de Charriere, a 46-year-old Dutch woman of letters, who later helped publish Rousseau's Confessions, and who knew his uncle David-Louis Constant de Rebecque extremely well by virtue of a 15-year correspondence. While he stayed at her home in Colombier Switzerland, together they wrote an epistolary novel. She acted as a maternal mentor to him until Constant's appointment to the court of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel that required him to move north. He left the court when the War of the First Coalition began in 1792. In Braunschweig, he married Wilhelmina von Cramm, but she divorced him in 1793. In September 1794, he met and became interested in the famous and wealthy already married Germaine de Sta√´l, herself brought up on the principles of Rousseau. They both admired Jean Lambert Tallien and Talleyrand. Their intellectual collaboration between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of the time.Their affair resulted in one presumed daughter Albertine. =Paris= Jouxtens-M√©zery, Grosse Grange After the Reign of Terror in France (1793‚Äì1794), Constant became an advocate of bicameralism and of an assembly like the Parliament of Great Britain. In revolutionary France this strand of political thought resulted in the Constitution of the Year III, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients. In 1799, after 18 Brumaire, Constant was reluctantly appointed, on the insistence of Abbe Sieyes, by Napoleon Bonaparte to the Tribunat, despite grave reservations on the latter's part. Eventually, in 1802, the first consul confirmed in his doubts, forced Constant to withdraw because of the tenor of his speeches and his close connection with Mme de Sta√´l.√âtienne Hofmann, Les ¬´ Principes de politique ¬ª de Benjamin Constant, Librairie Droz, 1980, vol. 1. p.187-193. Constant became acquainted with Julie Talma, the salonni√®re wife of actor Fran√ßois-Joseph Talma, who wrote many letters to him of compelling human interest. In 1800, the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt to assassinate Napoleon, failed. In 1803, at a time when Britain and France were at peace, Jean Gabriel Peltier, while living in England, argued that Napoleon should be assassinated. The lawyer James Mackintosh defended the French refugee, Peltier against a libel suit instigated by Napoleon ‚Äì then First Consul of France. Mackintosh's speech was widely published in English and also across Europe in a French translation by Madame de Sta√´l. She was forced to leave Paris as a result. De Sta√´l, disappointed by French rationalism, became interested in German romanticism. She and Constant set out for Prussia and Saxony and travelled with her two children to Weimar. Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel welcomed them the day after their arrival. In Weimar they met Friedrich von Schiller. Due to illness Johann Wolfgang Goethe at first hesitated. In Berlin, they met August Wilhelm Schlegel, and his brother, Friedrich Schlegel. Constant left de Sta√´l in Leipzig and in 1806 lived in Rouen and Meulan, where he started work on his novel Adolphe. In 1808, he secretly married Caroline von Hardenberg, a woman who had been divorced twice, (she was related to Novalis and to Karl August von Hardenberg). He moved back to Paris in 1814, where the French Restoration took place and Louis XVIII had become king. As a member of the Council of State, Constant proposed a constitutional monarchy. He became friends with Madame R√©camier while he fell out with Germaine de Sta√´l, who had asked him to pay back his gambling debts when their daughter, Albertine, married Victor de Broglie. During the Hundred Days of Napoleon, who had become more liberal, Constant fled to the Vend√©e, but returned when he was invited several times to the Tuileries to set up changes for the Charter of 1815. Portrait of Constant After the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), Constant moved to London with his wife. In 1817, the year when Madame de Staƒïl died, he was back in Paris, and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower legislative house of the Restoration-era government. One of its most eloquent orators, he became a leader of the parliamentary bloc first known as the Independents and later as \\"liberals\\". He became an opponent of Charles X of France during the Restoration between 1815 and 1830.G. Lanson, P. Tuffrau, Manuel d'histoire de la Litt√©rature Fran√ßaise, Hachette, Paris 1953 In 1822, Goethe praised Constant in the following terms: > I spent many instructive evenings with Benjamin Constant. Whoever recollects > what this excellent man accomplished in [later] years, and with what zeal he > advanced without wavering along the path which, once chosen, was forever > followed, realizes what noble aspirations, as yet undeveloped, were > fermenting within him. In 1830, King Louis Philippe I gave Constant a large sum of money to help him pay off his debts, and appointed him to the Conseil d'Etat. Constant is said to have fathered Albertine de Sta√´l-Holstein (1797‚Äì1838), who later married Victor de Broglie (1785‚Äì1870). Constant died in Paris on 8 December 1830 and was buried in the Pere la Chaise cemetery.Location: in division 29. Political philosophy Isabelle de Charri√®re, a Dutch-Swiss intellectual with whom Constant conducted an extensive correspondence =Ancient and modern freedom= One of the first thinkers to go by the name of \\"liberal\\", Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society. He drew a distinction between the \\"Liberty of the Ancients\\" and the \\"Liberty of the Moderns\\". The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to influence politics directly through debates and votes in the public assembly. To support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies, in which they could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs. The Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a mercantile society in which there were no slaves but almost everybody had to earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from daily political involvement. =Critique of the French Revolution= He criticised several aspects of the French Revolution, and the failures of the social and political upheaval. He stated how the French attempted to apply ancient republican liberties to a modern state. Constant realized that freedom meant drawing a line between a person's private life and that of state interference.Rosenblatt 2004 He praised the noble spirit of regenerating the state. However, he stated that it was na√Øve for writers to believe that two thousand years had not brought some changes in the customs and needs of the people. The dynamics of the state had changed. Ancient populations paled in comparison to the size of modern countries. He even argued that with a large population, man had no role in government regardless of its form or type. Constant emphasised how citizens in ancient states found more satisfaction in the public sphere and less in their private lives whereas modern people favoured their private life. Constant's repeated denunciation of despotism pervaded his critique of French political philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Abb√© de Mably. These writers, influential in the French Revolution, according to Constant, mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of the state. Alleged reformers used the model of public force of the Ancien R√©gime, and organised the most absolute despotism in the name of the Republic. He continually condemned despotism, citing the contradiction of a liberty derived from despotism, and the vacuous nature of this ideology. Furthermore, he pointed out the detrimental nature of the Reign of Terror, as an inexplicable delirium. In Fran√ßois Furet's words, Constant's \\"entire political thought\\" revolved around this question, namely the problem of how to justify the Terror.Furet 1981, p. 27 Constant understood the revolutionaries' disastrous over-investment in the political sphere. The French revolutionaries such as the Sans-culottes were the primary force in the streets. They promoted constant vigilance in public. Constant pointed out how despite the most obscure life, the quietest existence, the most unknown name, it offered no protection during the Reign of Terror. The pervasive mob mentality deterred many right thinking people and helped to usher in despots such as Napoleon. =Commerce preferable to war= Moreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleon's belligerence, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to rely on war, whereas a state organized on the principles of Modern Liberty would tend to be at peace with all other peaceful nations. Mme de Sta√´l et sa fille (around 1805); de Sta√´l was Constant's partner and intellectual collaborator Charlotte von Hardenberg, Constant's second, \\"secret\\" wife Madame R√©camier (1777‚Äì1849) by Alexandre-Evariste Fragonard Juliette R√©camier was a friend and intellectual correspondent of Constant Constant believed that if liberty were to be salvaged from the aftermath of the Revolution, then the chimera of Ancient Liberty had to be reconciled with the practical to achieve Modern Liberty. England, since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the United Kingdom after 1707, had demonstrated the practicality of Modern Liberty and Britain was a constitutional monarchy. Constant concluded that constitutional monarchy was better suited than republicanism to maintaining Modern Liberty. He was instrumental in drafting the \\"Acte Additional\\" of 1815, which transformed Napoleon's restored rule into a modern constitutional monarchy.English Text of the Charter This was only to last for \\"One Hundred Days\\" before Napoleon was defeated, but Constant's work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty. Indeed, the French Constitution (or Charter) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of Constant's ideas: a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected Chamber of Deputies and a senatorial Chamber of Peers, with the executive power vested in responsible ministers. Thus, although often ignored in France, because of his Anglo-Saxon sympathies, Constant succeeded in contributing in a profound (albeit indirect) way to French constitutional traditions. =Constitutional monarchy= Secondly, Constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy, in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power, protecting, balancing and restraining the excesses of the other active powers (the executive, legislature, and judiciary). This was an advance on the prevailing theory in the English-speaking world, which, following the opinion of William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, had regarded the King as head of the executive branch. In Constant's scheme, the executive power would be entrusted to a Council of Ministers (or Cabinet) who, although appointed by the King, were ultimately accountable to Parliament. In making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the King (as head of state) and the ministers (as Executive), Constant was responding to the political reality which had become apparent in Britain for more than a century: that is, the ministers, and not the King, are responsible actors, and the King \\"reigns but does not rule\\". This was important for the development of parliamentary government in France and elsewhere. The King was not to be a powerless cipher in Constant's scheme. He would have many powers, including the power to make judicial appointments, to dissolve the Chamber and call new elections, to appoint the peers, and to dismiss ministers ‚Äì but he would not be able to govern, make policy, or direct the administration, since that would be the task of the responsible ministers. This theory was literally applied in Portugal (1822) and Brazil (1824), where the King/Emperor was explicitly given \\"Moderating Powers\\" rather than executive power. Elsewhere (for example, the 1848 \\"Statuto albertino\\" of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which later became the basis of the Italian constitution from 1861) the executive power was notionally vested in the King, but was exercised only by the responsible ministers. He advocated the separation of powers as a basis for a liberal State, but unlike Montesquieu and most of the liberal thinkers, he advocated five powers instead of three. They were: # the Monarch or Moderator, # the Executive, # the Representative Power of Opinion, # the Representative Power of Tradition and # the Judiciary. Thus the Moderating Power was a monarch, a type of judge, who was not part of government, but served as a neutral power to the government, the Executive Power was vested in the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were, collectively, the head of government, the Representative Powers were a separation of the Monstesquieu's Legislative power, with the Representative Power of Opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizenry and the Representative Power of Tradition was a hereditary House of Peers and the judiciary was similar to the Montesquieu's Judicial Power. Constant's other concerns included a \\"new type of federalism\\": a serious attempt to decentralize French government through the devolution of powers to elected municipal councils. This proposal reached fruition in 1831, when elected municipal councils (albeit on a narrow franchise) were created. Comparative religion Aside from his political and literary output, Constant spent forty years working on religion and religious feeling. His publications demonstrate his desire to grasp this social phenomenon inherent to human nature, which, in whatever forms it may present, is always a search for perfectibility. If its manifestations become rigid, splitting becomes inevitable. Thus, however religious feeling may present, it needs to adapt and evolve. Constant is adamant that political authority should not meddle in the religious beliefs of the citizenry, even to defend them. In his view it is up to each person to decide where to seek their consolation, moral compass or faith. External authority cannot act upon someone's convictions, it can only act upon their interests.Constant. Principes de politique, Livre VIII, chapitre IV He also condemns a religion that is commonly regarded as utilitarian, since it degrades authentic religious feeling. He considers that it was necessary for polytheism to decline in line with human progress. The more humans progress in their understanding, the more beneficial the effects of theism.Constant. Polyth√©isme romain, II, p.312 Belief in a god has itself evolved. Christianity, especially protestantism is, he argues, its most tolerant form and an indicator of intellectual, moral and spiritual evolution. Novels Constant published only one novel during his lifetime, Adolphe (1816), the story of a young, indecisive man's disastrous love affair with an older mistress. A first-person novel in the sentimentalist tradition, Adolphe examines the thoughts of the young man as he falls in and out of love with Ellenore, a woman of uncertain virtue. Constant began the novel as an autobiographical tale of two loves, but decided that the reading public would object to serial passions. The love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on Constant's affair with Anna Lindsay, who describes the affair in her correspondence (published in the Revue des Deux Mondes, December 1930 ‚Äì January 1931). The book has been compared to Chateaubriand's Ren√© or Mme de Stael's Corinne. As a young man, Constant became acquainted with a literary friend of his uncle, David-Louis Constant de Rebecque. She was Isabelle de Charri√®re, a Dutch woman of letters with whom he jointly wrote an epistolary novel, under the title, Les Lettres d'Arsill√© fils, Sophie Durf√© et autres.Wood, Dennis. Isabelle de Charri√®re et Benjamin Constant. √Ä propos d'une d√©couverte r√©cente.

(Oxford, Voltaire Foundation, 1982), . Legacy The importance of Constant's writings on the liberty of the ancients and of that of his time has dominated understanding of his work, as has his critique of the French Revolution. The British philosopher and historian of ideas, Sir Isaiah Berlin has acknowledged his debt to Constant. According to Berlin, the most eloquent of all defenders of freedom and privacy [was] Benjamin Constant, who had not forgotten the Jacobin dictatorship. Constant's wider literary and cultural writings (most importantly the novella Adolphe and his extensive history of comparative religion) emphasised the importance of self-sacrifice and effect of human emotions as a basis for social living. Thus, while he pleaded for individual liberty as vital for individual and moral development and appropriate for modernity, he felt that egoism and self-interest were not part of a true definition of individual liberty. Emotional authenticity and fellow- feeling were critical. In this, his moral and religious thought was strongly influenced by the moral writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and German thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, whom he read in reference to his religious history.

In 1894, Valadon became the first woman painter admitted to the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. She was also the mother of painter Maurice Utrillo. Valadon spent nearly 40 years of her life as an artist.Marchesseau 9 The subjects of her drawings and paintings, such as Joy of Life (1911), included mostly female nudes, female portraits, still lifes, and landscapes. She never attended the academy and was never confined within a tradition.Warnod 40 As a model Valadon appeared in such paintings as Pierre- Auguste Renoir's 1883 Dance at Bougival and Dance in the City, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's 1885 portrait.  Early life  Valadon is depicted dancing in Pierre-Auguste Renoirs 1883 painting, Dance at Bougival Valadon grew up in poverty with her mother, an unmarried laundress in Montmartre; she did not know her father. Known to be quite independent and rebellious, she attended primary school until age 11. She began working at age 11 in a variety of areas including a milliner's workshop, a factory making funeral wreaths, a market selling vegetables, a waitress, and then finally in the circus.Warnod 13 At the age of 15 Valadon met Count Antoine de la Rochefoucauld and Th√®o Wagner, two symbolist painters who were involved in decorating a circus belonging to Medrano. Through this connection she began work at the Mollier circus as an acrobat until she fell from a trapeze after a year of work. The circus was frequented by artists such as Lautrec, Sescau and Berthe Morisot and this may be where Morisot did her painting of Valadon. It is commonly believed that Valadon taught herself how to draw at the age of nine. In the Montmartre quarter of Paris, she pursued her interest in art, first working as a model for artists, observing and learning their techniques, before becoming a noted painter herself. Model Valadon debuted as a model in 1880 in Montmartre at age 15.Rose 9 She modeled for over 10 years for many different artists including Pierre-C√©cile Puvis de Chavannes, Th√©ophile Steinlen, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean-Jacques Henner, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. She modeled under the name \\"Maria\\" before being nicknamed \\"Suzanne\\" by Toulouse-Lautrec, after the biblical story of Susanna and the Elders as he felt that she especially liked modeling for older artists.Marchesseau 14 For two years, she was Toulouse-Lautrec's lover until her attempted suicide in 1888. Valadon helped to educate herself in art by observing the artists at work for whom she posed. She was considered a very focused, ambitious, rebellious, determined, self- confident, and passionate woman.Marchesseau 15 In the early 1890s, she befriended Edgar Degas who, impressed with her bold line drawings and fine paintings, purchased her work and encouraged her; she remained one of his closest friends until his death. Art historian Heather Dawkins believed that Valadon's experience as a model added depth to her own images of nude women, which tended to be less idealized than the male post-impressionists' representations. The most recognizable image of Valadon is in Renoir's Dance at Bougival from 1883, the same year that she posed for Dance in the City. In 1885, Renoir painted her portrait again as Girl Braiding Her Hair. Another of his portraits of her in 1885, Suzanne Valadon, is of her head and shoulders in profile. Valadon frequented the bars and taverns of Paris with her fellow painters, and she was Toulouse-Lautrec's subject in his oil painting The Hangover. Artist Joy of Life (1911), Metropolitan Museum of Art Valadon began painting full-time in 1896. She painted still lifes, portraits, flowers, and landscapes that are noted for their strong composition and vibrant colors. She was, however, best known for her candid female nudes that depict women's bodies from a woman's perspective.Burns, Janet M.C. Looking as Women: The Painting of Suzanne Valadon, Paula Modersohn-Becker and Frida Kahlo, Atlantis 1993: 18(1&2): 25‚Äì46. Her work attracted attention partly because, as a woman painting unidealized nudes, she upset the social norms of the time. Valadon's earliest surviving signed and dated work is a self-portrait from 1883, drawn in charcoal and pastel. She produced mostly drawings between 1883 and 1893, and began painting in 1892. Her first models were family members, especially her son, mother, and niece.Warnod 48, 57 Her earliest known female nude was executed in 1892.Rose 97 In 1895, the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel exhibited a group of twelve etchings by Valadon that show women in various stages of their toilettes. Later, she regularly showed at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Valadon's first time in the Salon de la Nationale was in 1894. She also exhibited in the Salon d'Automne from 1909, Salon des Independants from 1911; Salon des Femmes Artistes Modernes, 1933-1938. Degas was notably the first person to buy drawings from her,Warnod 51 and he also introduced her to other collectors, including Paul Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard. Degas also taught her the skill of soft-ground etching.Warnod 55 Casting the Net (1914), Museum of Fine Arts Nancy In 1896, Valadon became a full-time painter after her marriage to the well-to-do banker Paul Mousis. She made a shift from drawing to painting starting in 1909.Marchesseau 17 Her first large oils for the Salon related to sexual pleasure, and they were some of the first examples in painting for the man to be an object of desire by a woman. These notable Salon paintings include Adam and Eve (Adam et Eve) (1909), Joy of Life (La Joie de vivre) (1911), and Casting the Net (Lancement du filet) (1914).Marchesseau 18-19 In her lifetime, Valadon produced around 273 drawings, 478 paintings, and 31 etchings, excluding pieces given away or destroyed. Valadon was well known during her lifetime, especially towards the end of her career. Her works are in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Grenoble, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, among others. =Style= Abandoned Doll (1921), National Museum of Women in the Arts Valadon was not confined to a specific style, yet both Symbolist and Post- Impressionist aesthetics are clearly seen within her work. She worked primarily with oil paint, oil pencils, pastels, and red chalk; she did not use ink or watercolor because these mediums were too fluid for her preference.Marchesseau 16 Valadon's paintings feature rich colors and bold, open brushwork often featuring firm black lines to define and outline her figures. Valadon's self-portraits, portraits, nudes, landscapes, and still lifes remain detached from trends and aspects of academic art.Marchesseau 9, 11 The subjects of Valadon's paintings often reinvent the old masters' themes: women bathing, reclining nudes, and interior scenes. She preferred to paint working-class models. Art historian Patricia Mathews suggests that Valadon's working-class status and experience as a model influenced her intimate, familiar observation of these women's bodies. In this respect she differed from Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, who painted mostly women, but \\"remained well within the bounds of propriety in their subject matter\\" because of their upper-middle-class status in French society. Valadon's marginalized status allowed her to enter the male domain of art through modeling, and her lack of formal academic training may have made her feel more comfortable breaking with convention. She has been considered a transgressor as a woman painting the nude female body.Mathews 418 She resisted typical depictions of women via their class and supposed sexuality through her use of unidealised and self- possessed bodies that are not overly sexualised.Mathews 416, 419, 423 She also painted many nude self-portraits across the span of her career, the later of which displayed her aging body. Valadon emphasised the importance of composition of her portraits over painting expressive eyes. Her later works, such as Blue Room (1923), are brighter in color and show a new emphasis on decorative backgrounds and patterned materials. Personal life Self- Portrait (1898), Museum of Fine Arts Houston In 1883, aged 18, Valadon gave birth to a son, Maurice Utrillo. Valadon's mother cared for Maurice while she returned to modelling. Valadon's friend Miguel Utrillo would later sign papers recognizing Maurice as his son, although his true paternity is uncertain.Warnod 48 In 1893, Valadon began a short-lived affair with composer Erik Satie, moving to a room next to his on the . Satie became obsessed with her, calling her his ', writing impassioned notes about \\"her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet\\", but after six months she left, leaving him devastated. Valadon married the stockbroker Paul Mousis in 1895, living with him for 13 years in an apartment in Paris and in a house in the outlying region. In 1909, Valadon began an affair with the painter Andr√© Utter, the 23-year-old friend of her son, divorcing Moussis in 1913.Marchesseau 17-18 Valadon married Utter in 1914,Giraudon, Oxford Art Online and he managed her career as well as her son's. Valadon and Utter regularly exhibited work together until the couple divorced in 1934.  Feminist legacy  As one of the best documented French artists of the early 20th century, Valadon's body of work has been of great interest to feminist art historians, especially given her focus on the female form. Her work was candid and occasionally awkward, often characterized by strong lines, and her resistance to both academic and avant-garde conventions for representing the female nude have encouraged interest in her work: > It has been argued that many of her images of women signal a form of > resistance to some of the dominant representations of female sexuality in > early 20th-century Western art. Many of her nudes painted from the 1910s > onwards are heavily proportioned and sometimes awkwardly posed. They are > conspicuously at odds with the svelte, 'feminine' type to be found in the > imagery of both popular and 'high' art.

An earlier novel by Sarah Baylis, entitled Utrillo's Mother, was published first in England and later in the United States. Timberlake Wertenbaker's play, The Line (2009), traces the relationship between Valadon and Degas. Valadon was the basis for the character Suzanne Rouvier in the novel The Razor's Edge by W. Somerset Maugham.The Razor's Edge by W. S. Maugham Honors Both an asteroid (6937 Valadon) and a crater on Venus are named in her honor. The small square at the base of the Montmartre funicular in Paris is named Place Suzanne Valadon. At the top of the funicular, and less than 50 meters to its east, are the steps named rue Maurice Utrillo after her son the artist.

Production After releasing their independent debut album Fungus Amongus, Incubus signed a seven-record deal with Sony-affiliated Immortal Records. Their first full-length major label effort S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was recorded during May‚ÄìJune 1997. Singer Brandon Boyd said \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was done in six weeks in a very small, charming studio in Santa Monica. Very different experience, but very important on this band's existence.\\" Music S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is influenced by several genres, including heavy metal, electro, funk, jazz, hip hop and techno. According to Rolling Stone writer Rob Kemp, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. \\"links funk metal to the rap metal\\". \\"Magic Medicine\\" incorporates elements of trip hop, sampling a recorded reading of a children's book. Reception Critics wrote favorably of the album's diverse style. Pitchfork state that Incubus \\"successfully combines all sorts of [music genres] without sounding like a mess\\". AllMusic reviewer David Thomas wrote that \\"The numerous styles on the album don't always blend perfectly, but they create a solid sound that defines the band. Incubus also manages to make their songs upbeat and danceable as well as tunes to headbang to. An admirable feat in a genre that tends to reward decibel levels instead of quality.\\" Drop-D Magazine reviewer Darren Kerr praised the album's incorporation of turntablism and trip hop. Kerr also noted similarities between Faith No More, writing \\"I would not dispute that Brandon of the Jungle's evil-lounge-singer-morphing-into-teeth-gnashing-maniac vocal style is emulative of Mike Patton. I also would not argue that a couple of these songs would not sound out of place alongside FNM tracks like 'Caffeine' or 'The Gentle Art of Making Enemies'.

Over the course of his career Perlman has performed worldwide, and throughout the United States, in venues that have included a State Dinner at the White House honoring Queen Elizabeth II, and at the Presidential Inauguration of President Obama. He has conducted the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Westchester Philharmonic. In 2015, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He has been awarded 16 Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and four Emmy Awards. Early life Perlman was born in 1945 in Tel Aviv. His parents, Chaim and Shoshana Perlman, were Jewish natives of Poland and had independently immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) in the mid-1930s before they met and later married. Perlman contracted polio at age four and has walked using leg braces and crutches since then and plays the violin while seated. , he uses crutches or an electric Amigo scooter for mobility. Perlman first became interested in the violin after hearing a classical music performance on the radio. At the age of three, he was denied admission to the Shulamit Conservatory for being too small to hold a violin. He instead taught himself how to play the instrument using a toy fiddle until he was old enough to study with Rivka Goldgart at the Shulamit Conservatory and at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music), where he gave his first recital at age 10. He moved to the United States at age 13 to study at the Juilliard School with the violin pedagogue Ivan Galamian and his assistant Dorothy DeLay. Career=Performing= Ed Sullivan congratulates 13-year-old Itzhak Perlman after a concert (1958) Perlman appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show twice in 1958, and again in 1964, on the same show with the Rolling Stones. He made his debut at Carnegie Hall in 1963 and won the Leventritt Competition in 1964. Soon afterward, he began to tour widely. In addition to an extensive recording and performance career, he has continued to make guest appearances on American television shows such as The Tonight Show and Sesame Street as well as playing at a number of functions at the White House. Although he has never been billed or marketed as a singer, he sang the role of \\"Un carceriere\\" (\\"a jailer\\") on a 1981 EMI recording of Puccini's \\"Tosca\\" that featured Renata Scotto, Pl√°cido Domingo, and Renato Bruson, with James Levine conducting. He had earlier sung the role in an excerpt from the opera on a 1980 Pension Fund Benefit Concert telecast as part of the Live from Lincoln Center series with Luciano Pavarotti as Cavaradossi and Zubin Mehta conducting the New York Philharmonic. On 5 July 1986, he performed on the New York Philharmonic's tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, which was televised live on ABC Television in the United States. The orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta, performed in Central Park. In 1987, he joined the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) for their concerts in Warsaw and Budapest as well as other cities in Eastern bloc countries. He toured with the IPO in the spring of 1990 for its first-ever performance in the Soviet Union, with concerts in Moscow and Leningrad, and toured with the IPO again in 1994, performing in China and India. In 2015 on a classical music program entitled The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center produced by WQXR in New York City, it was revealed that Perlman performed the uncredited violin solo on the 1989 Billy Joel song \\"The Downeaster Alexa\\". While primarily a solo artist, Perlman has performed with a number of other musicians, including Yo-Yo Ma, Pinchas Zukerman, Jessye Norman, Isaac Stern, and Yuri Temirkanov at the 150th anniversary celebration of Tchaikovsky in Leningrad in December 1990. He has also performed and recorded with his friend and fellow Israeli violinist/violist Pinchas Zukerman on numerous occasions over the years. As well as playing and recording the classical music for which he is best known, Perlman has also played jazz, including an album made with jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, and in addition, klezmer. Perlman has been a soloist for a number of film scores such as the theme of the 1993 film Schindler's List by John Williams, which subsequently won an Academy Award for Best Original Score. More recently, he was the violin soloist for the 2005 film Memoirs of a Geisha along with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Perlman played selections from the musical scores of the movies nominated for \\"Best Original Score\\" at the 73rd Academy Awards with Yo-Yo Ma and at the 78th Academy Awards. =Selected performances= Perlman at the White House in 2007 Perlman played at the state dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 2007, in the East Room at the White House. He performed John Williams's \\"Air and Simple Gifts\\" at the 2009 inauguration ceremony for Barack Obama along with Yo-Yo Ma (cello), Gabriela Montero (piano), and Anthony McGill (clarinet). While the quartet did play live, the music played simultaneously over speakers and on television was a recording made two days prior due to concerns over the cold weather damaging the instruments. Perlman was quoted as saying: \\"It would have been a disaster if we had done it any other way.\\"Quartet pre-recorded Obama music. BBC News (23 January 2009). He made an appearance in Disney's Fantasia 2000 to introduce the segment Pines of Rome, along with Steve Martin. On 2 November 2018, Perlman reprised the 60th anniversary of his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show as a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Teaching In 1975, Perlman accepted a faculty post at the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College. In 2003, Mr. Perlman was named the holder of the Dorothy Richard Starling Foundation Chair in Violin Studies at the Juilliard School, succeeding his teacher, Dorothy DeLay. He also currently teaches students one-on-one at the Perlman Music Program on Long Island, NY, rarely holding master classes. =The Perlman Music Program= The Perlman Music Program, founded in 1994 by Perlman's wife, Toby Perlman, and Suki Sandler, started as a summer camp for exceptional string musicians between the ages of 12 and 18. Over time, it expanded to a year-long program. Students have the chance to have Itzhak Perlman himself coach them before they play at venues such as the Sutton Place Synagogue and public schools. By introducing students to each other and requiring them to practice together, the program strives to have musicians who would otherwise practice alone and develop a network of friends and colleagues. Rather than remain isolated, participants in the program find an area where they belong. =Conducting= At the beginning of the new millennium, Perlman began to conduct. He took the post of principal guest conductor at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. He served as music advisor to the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra from 2002 to 2004. In November 2007, the Westchester Philharmonic announced the appointment of Perlman as artistic director and principal conductor. His first concert in these roles was on 11 October 2008, in an all-Beethoven program featuring pianist Leon Fleisher performing the Emperor Concerto. Instruments Perlman plays the Soil Stradivarius violin of 1714, formerly owned by Yehudi Menuhin and considered one of the finest violins made during Stradivari's \\"golden period.\\" Perlman also plays the Guarneri del Ges√π 1743 'Sauret' and the Carlo Bergonzi 1740 'ex-Kreisler'. Personal life Perlman lives in New York City with his wife, Toby, also a classically trained violinist. They have five children, including Navah Perlman, a concert pianist and chamber musician.

However, more recently, acts wishing to include enhanced content often include a DVD instead, with the disadvantage of it not playing in a CD audio player, but with the advantage of storing greater amounts of data and/or higher-quality video. Problems Sometimes computer CD-ripping programs (particularly cdparanoia and CDBurnerXP) have problems ripping some enhanced CDs, especially those that have the data in a separate section after the audio section. These CDs have the data 11,400 sectors (2m32s) after the audio, but some CD rippers may try to rip this blank section with the last track; the end result is that the ripper stalls during the last track or simply reports errors.

It stars Peter O'Toole, Mark Linn-Baker, Jessica Harper, and Joseph Bologna. O'Toole was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was adapted into an unsuccessful 1992 Broadway musical of the same name. Plot Benjy Stone, the narrator, tells of the summer (in his \\"favorite year\\" of 1954) he met his idol, swashbuckling actor Alan Swann (perhaps intended to evoke Errol Flynn, whose title roles like Captain Blood would be evoked by Swann's imagined (but screened) one in Captain from Tortuga). In the early days of television, Benjy works as a junior comedy writer for a variety show called Comedy Cavalcade starring Stan \\"King\\" Kaiser broadcast live from the NBC studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. As a special upcoming guest, they get the still-famous Swann, who is largely washed up. However, when he shows up, he turns out to be a roaring drunk and Kaiser is ready to \\"dump him\\" until Benjy intervenes, promising to keep the \\"washed-up jaboni\\" sober during the week leading up to his scheduled appearance. As Benjy watches out for Alan, or at least tries to keep up with him, they learn much about each other, including the fact that they each have family they prefer to hide from the rest of the world. In Benjy's case, it's his Jewish mother, who is married to a Filipino former bantamweight boxer, Rookie Carroca, and Benjy's embarrassing relatives, such as uncouth Uncle Morty. For Swann, it is his young daughter, Tess, who has been raised entirely by her mother, one of his many ex-wives. He stays away, but continues to keep tabs on her secretly, frustrated that he cannot muster the courage to reconnect with her. During the week of rehearsals, Kaiser is threatened by corrupt union boss Karl Rojeck (who might evoke the contemporaneous James Hoffa) and objects to being parodied on the show. Disruptive events, ambiguous between sabotage and random accidents, are noted after Kaiser belligerently refuses to stop performing the \\"Boss Hijack\\" sketches. In a subplot, Benjy tries, clumsily and over-enthusiastically, to win the affections of co-worker K. C. Downing. Swann advises him on the right approach, which includes crashing a party at the home of K.C.'s affluent parents. The night of the show finally arrives, but minutes away from going on-air, Swann suffers a panic attack when Benjy informs him that the show is broadcast live. (He is accustomed to getting many takes to get his lines right, exclaiming, \\"I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star!\\") Swann gets drunk, and rushes out from the studio, but is confronted by Benjy, who angrily tells him that he always thought of Swann as the swashbuckling hero he saw on the big screen, and that deep down, Swann possesses those qualities as a person. As Benjy puts it, \\"Nobody's that good an actor!\\" As the \\"Boss Hijack\\" sketch gets underway, Rojeck's men show up backstage and begin beating up Kaiser. The fight spills onto the stage during the live broadcast (with the audience thinking that it is part of the comedy sketch). Swann and Benjy observe the melee from a balcony, when the audience suddenly notices Swann and breaks into enthusiastic applause. Swann grabs a rope and swings into action (dressed as a Musketeer for a later skit), saving Kaiser in front of an appreciative if still clueless audience. Benjy narrates the epilogue, relating that Swann, his confidence bolstered, finally gets up the nerve to visit his daughter the next day and the two apparently have a heartfelt reunion. Cast In addition, future Phil Spector murder victim Lana Clarkson appears, uncredited, as the girl in the Old Gold Cigarette Box, while Gloria Stuart, who 15 years later (in Titanic) would raise the record, at 86, for oldest person to receive an Academy Award nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress, appears as Mrs. Horn. Relationship to real life Mel Brooks, executive producer of the film, was a writer for the Sid Caesar variety program Your Show of Shows early in his career. Movie swashbuckler Errol Flynn was a guest on one episode, and this real-life occurrence inspired Dennis Palumbo's largely fictional screenplay. Swann was obviously based on Flynn, while Benjy Stone is loosely based on both Brooks and Woody Allen, who also wrote for Caesar. According to Brooks, the character of Rookie Carroca also was based on a real person, a Filipino sailor in the U. S. Navy who was his neighbor in Brooklyn. Much like Alan Brady on The Dick Van Dyke Show, King Kaiser represented Sid Caesar (\\"Kaiser\\" is the German equivalent of the Roman title Caesar). Selma Diamond, another former Your Show of Shows writer (who inspired Rose Marie's 'Sally Rogers' character on The Dick Van Dyke Show), appears in the film as a wardrobe mistress. The character of Herb, a comedy writer who whispers almost everything he has to say, is loosely based on Neil Simon, another of Caesar's staff writers, who, according to co-worker Carl Reiner, whispered ideas to colleagues rather than try to shout to be heard above the din of the noisy writers' room. Simon and Reiner made their own use of their Your Show of Shows experiences. Laughter on the 23rd Floor, written by Simon for the stage and later a television film, included thinly disguised versions of Sid Caesar and his staff. So did The Dick Van Dyke Show, which was created by Brooks' friend and colleague, Reiner (who would later star in Van Dyke's show as Alan Brady, with the character of Buddy Sorrell based on Brooks). Brooks acknowledges that most of the movie's plot was fiction. He said that Flynn's appearance on Your Show of Shows was uneventful, that none of the writers had much interaction with Flynn, let alone became his friend or took him home to dinner. Production The film was based on an original script by Norman Steinberg.Klemesrud, Judy. At the Movies: L.I. 'Red, Hot and Blue' The New York Times 14 August 1981: C6. My Favorite Year was the first directing effort for actor Richard Benjamin who was an NBC page at 30 Rock in 1956. Cameron Mitchell recalled that he met Mel Brooks when both were having lunch at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Commissary. Brooks told him that Gorilla at Large (which starred Mitchell and Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft) was his favourite film and asked him if he wanted to play a Jimmy Hoffa-type union boss in a movie for him. Mitchell accepted and was cast in the film as \\"Boss\\" Rojeck. Release My Favorite Year opened in 714 North American theaters on October 1, 1982 to $2,400,696 (#3, behind An Officer and a Gentlemens eleventh weekend and E.T.: The Extra Terrestrials eighteenth). The film holds a 96% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews. Musical Lainie Kazan was the only member of the cast who reprised her film role for 1992's Broadway musical version of My Favorite Year, in which the character Alan Swann was portrayed by Tim Curry. Both were nominated for Tony Awards for their performances.

Canada has a tradition of liberalism in the centrist context, as far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society. Peace, order, and good government are stated goals of the Canadian government. Individual rights, equality and inclusiveness (a just society) have risen to the forefront of political and legal importance for most Canadians, as demonstrated through support for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a relatively free economy, and social liberal attitudes toward homosexuality, women's rights, and other egalitarian movements. However, there is also a sense of collective responsibility in Canadian political culture, as is demonstrated in general support for universal health care, multiculturalism, gun control, foreign aid, and other social programs. Canadian politics has been dominated by two main political parties for much of its existence, the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right Conservative Party of Canada. The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the center of the political scale with the Conservatives sitting on the right and the New Democratic Party occupying the left-wing. Smaller parties like the Quebec nationalist Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and the Green Party of Canada have also been able to exert their influence over the political process by representation at the federal level. Political cleavages Canadian political parties and leaders can be analyzed based on various positions. = Economy = In the 19th century, the Liberal Party stood for British classical liberalism and free trade, and the Conservatives, especially the Red Tories, for protectionism. In the 20th century, however, the Liberal Party adopted more elements of European reform liberalism and co-opted elements of the social-democratic Progressive Party of Canada, and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. In the 1990s, the Liberals shifted back to a more neoliberal position on the economy and trade. Within the Reform Party of Canada there was an element of anti-market populism but this faded as the Reform Party became more associated with US-style conservatism. The NDP have retained many of the socialist tendencies of the former CCF. = Federal provincial relations = In regard to federal-provincial relations it can be said that BQ are separatist, the Conservatives decentralist, the Liberals centralist, and the NDP supporters of asymmetric federalism. = Diversity = With regards to issues of diversity (bilingualism and multiculturalism), the Conservatives tend to be more majoritarian, favouring a reduced scope for official bilingualism and a more assimilationist approach to immigrants and Native peoples. The Liberals and NDP are more pluralistic including generous government support for minority cultures, while the BQ favour viewing Canada as two separate societies (English Canada and Quebec), and advocate strong protections for French language and culture in Quebec while remaining unconcerned about issues with other minorities or in other parts of the country. = United States = In the 19th century, the Conservatives were a party of protectionism and the Liberals favoured free trade with the US. = Religion = In the 19th and early 20th centuries, English Canada remained strongly committed to the British Empire and Protestantism. French Canada was more anti-imperialist and strongly Catholic. Attempting to form stable parties that could win seats in both areas was a daunting task and led to political deadlock in the Province of Canada before Confederation. During the era of Confederation, British-style Whig liberals from Canada West, the Clear Grits and Reformers, attempted to work with the anti-clerical minority in Canada East, the Parti rouge, and liberals in the Maritimes to form the Liberal Party. The avowedly anti-democratic Tories of the English colonies attempted to create a coalition with conservative Catholics in Canada East, the Parti bleu. Keeping these diverse coalitions united remained difficult when interests cut across party lines, and instead inflamed sectional feeling. The first such issues were the two Riel Rebellions of 1869 and 1885 which hardened Catholic‚ÄìProtestant animosity. The Tory government of Sir John A. Macdonald, himself an Orangeman, eventually oversaw the execution of Metis leader Louis Riel (a devout Catholic) for treason. The Tory party was decimated in Quebec, and the Liberal party everywhere else. Eventually, Sir Wilfrid Laurier was able to lead the Liberals back to a competitive position in English Canada, but by the time of the First World War, and the Conscription Crisis of 1917, Laurier again found himself in charge of a Liberal Party limited to Quebec and a few other pockets. In part because of the memories of these eras, the Tory party gained a reputation as being anti-Catholic and anti-French and remained substantially weaker than the Liberals in Quebec from the 1890s to the 1980s, with the lone exception of 1958. Meanwhile, Laurier's Liberals were accused of not supporting Britain forcefully enough during the Boer War and with the creation of the Canadian Navy, widely disparaged as a \\"Tin Pot Navy\\", which hurt his party in Anglo-Saxon Ontario. Since that time, sectarianism has faded substantially as an issue in Canada, and relations with Britain are no longer of nearly the same importance.

Conti was part of a campaign against the opening of a Tesco supermarket in nearby Belsize Park. Conti put his Hampstead house up for sale in 2015 for ¬£17.5 million after his long-running opposition to the building plans of his neighbour, the footballer Thierry Henry. Conti had also opposed development plans for Hampstead's Grove Lodge, the 18th-century Grade II listed former home of novelist John Galsworthy. Conti participated in a genetic-mapping project conducted by the company ScotlandsDNA (now called BritainsDNA). In 2012, Conti and the company announced that Conti shares a genetic marker with Napol√©on Bonaparte. Conti has said that he \\"burst out laughing\\" when told he was directly related to Napol√©on on his father's side. Politics Conti considered running as the Conservative candidate in the 2008 London mayoral election, but did not, and in the following election in 2012, he supported unsuccessful independent candidate Siobhan Benita. In the run up to the 2015 general election, Conti said in an interview published in several newspapers that he was once a Labour supporter but had come to view socialism as a religion with a \\"vicious, hostile spirit\\".

Quidde's long career spanned four different eras of German history: that of Bismarck (up to 1890); the Hohenzollern Empire under Wilhelm II (1888‚Äì1918); the Weimar Republic (1918-1933); and, finally, Nazi Germany. In 1927, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Born into a wealthy bourgeois merchant family, Quidde grew up in Bremen, read history and also got involved in the activities of the German Peace Society (Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft). In his younger years he had already opposed Bismarck's policies. In 1881 he received his PhD at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1894 Quidde published a 17-page pamphlet entitled Caligula. Eine Studie √ºber r√∂mischen Caesarenwahnsinn (Caligula: A Study of Imperial Insanity). Containing 79 footnotes, the short essay is exclusively about the Roman Empire of the 1st century AD. However, Quidde drew an implicit parallel between the Roman Emperor Caligula and Wilhelm II, de facto accusing both rulers of megalomania. The author had insisted on publishing his pamphlet under his real name, which effectively ended his academic career as a historian when, in some periodical, a short review explained the parallels which otherwise might have gone unnoticed. After he made a derogatory comment on a new medal in honour of William I, German Emperor, German Emperor from 1871 to 1888, he was criminally convicted of l√®se majest√©, and sentenced to three months in prison, which he served in Stadelheim Prison. After the end of the First World War, Quidde, like most other Germans, vehemently opposed the Treaty of Versailles but for different reasons from German militarists, who hated mainly the vast restrictions laid upon the German armed forces and the impending economic disaster that would be caused by payment of the high reparations that were decreed. He and other German pacifists thought ahead and hoped that US President Woodrow Wilson would win the day, pointing out that such severe conditions would already sow the seeds of a new war: When Hitler came to power in 1933, Quidde escaped to Switzerland, finally settling down in Geneva for the rest of his days. He remained an optimist throughout his life. Aged 76, he published his essay \\"Landfriede und Weltfriede\\" (1934) at a time when militarism was again on the rise, believing that modern technology might serve as a deterrent from war: Ludwig Quidde died in his Swiss exile in 1941, aged 82.

The main character in DeVries's novel was based largely on the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who was a compulsive womanizer and lifelong alcoholic, finally succumbing to the effects of alcohol poisoning in November 1953, while on a speaking tour in America. Plot Gowan McGland (Tom Conti) is a creatively blocked Scottish poet who ekes out a day-to-day existence by exploiting the generosity of strangers in an affluent Connecticut suburb, where he recites his verse to various arts groups and women's clubs. Gowan is something of a leech, cadging expensive dinners from well-off patrons (usually stealing the tips afterward) while seducing their bored wives and affecting a superior attitude toward the smug bourgeois types he exploits. Although a talented poet, he is a chronic drunk, indifferent to the wounds he can casually inflict with his wit. (When one of Gowan's middle-aged conquests undresses for him, he mutters, \\"Released from their support, her breasts dropped like hanged men,\\" reducing her to tears.) Gowan falls in love with a young college student, Geneva Spofford (Kelly McGillis), who has everything to lose from a relationship with a drunken deadbeat poet unable to hold a job. Gowan instigates two ugly incidents that eventually cause their breakup: first, a bar fight from which Geneva rescues him, and later, when he causes a scene in a fancy restaurant where the waiters know he has stolen their tips. He also suffers an ironic comeuppance from Dr. Jack Haxby (Joel Fabiani). The dentist, after finding out about the poet's affair with his wife, uses the ruse of free dental care for ruining Gowan's smile and forcing him to wear dentures. When Gowan finds out, it is already too late, and the damage is irrevocable. (Gowan fears losing his teeth, equating it with death.) Gowan prepares to hang himself, but while dictating his last thoughts into a tape recorder, he comes up with some good lines and regains his will to write. Unfortunately, his host's pet dog, an Old English sheepdog named Reuben, comes bounding into the room, causing Gowan to lose his balance before he can undo the noose, turning the aborted suicide into accidental asphyxiation. The film's title comprises Gowan's final words, an unsuccessful attempt to halt the dog.

The original screenplay was written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, with Dean Riesner making uncredited re-writes. Bridges was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role. The film inspired a short-lived television series of the same name in 1986. Plot Launched in 1977, the Voyager 2 space probe carried a gold phonographic disk with a message of peace, inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth. The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth. Instead of greeting the alien craft, the U.S. government shoots it down. Crashing in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin, the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of glowing energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden. While there, the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches. The alien \\"Starman\\" has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona. Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape. Having a very basic understanding of the English language which has come from the Voyager 2 disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona's Barringer Crater, in three days, he will die. Sympathetic but still wary, Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards so he can continue the journey alone, but when she witnesses him miraculously resurrect a dead deer, she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him. They are pursued across the country by the authorities and, after nearly being caught, Jenny is shot and critically wounded by a police officer. In order to escape, the Starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect the two of them from the explosion. They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed. He uses another silver sphere to heal Jenny. After being assured that Jenny will recover, the Starman proceeds to hitchhike towards Arizona without her, but Jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock. Reunited, the two of them hitchhike together, resuming their journey towards the crater. Later, while stowing away on a boxcar train, the couple makes love. The Starman tells Jenny \\"I gave you a baby tonight.\\" Jenny explains that she is infertile and cannot have children, but he assures her she is now pregnant. He explains that the baby will be the son of her dead husband, because he (Starman) is a clone of Scott, but as a child of Starman as well, their son will possess all of the Starman's knowledge and will grow up to be a teacher. Starman offers to stop the pregnancy if she wishes, but the joyful Jenny embraces him, accepting the gift. The couple mistakenly travel too far on the train and arrive in Las Vegas. Jenny realizes she has lost her wallet. The Starman uses one of their last quarters in a slot machine, which he manipulates in order to win the $500,000 jackpot. They then buy a new car to complete their journey to Arizona. Meanwhile, National Security Agency director George Fox learns that the Starman's flight trajectory, prior to being shot down, was to the Barringer Crater. Fox arranges to have the Starman captured by the Army, dead or alive. SETI scientist Mark Shermin, another government official involved in the case, criticizes Fox's heavy-handed approach and reminds him that the Starman was invited to Earth. Appalled to learn that Fox is planning to vivisect the alien, Shermin then resolves to help the Starman escape rather than allow Fox to capture him. Jenny and the now slowly dying Starman reach the crater as Army helicopters pursue them. Just as they are surrounded, a large, spherical spaceship appears and descends into the crater. Light surrounds the couple, and the Starman is instantly restored to health. As he prepares to leave, he tells Jenny he will never see her again. Jenny asks him to take her with him, but he says she would die on his world. He then gives her his last silver sphere, telling her that their son will know what to do with it. Jenny watches as the ship departs.

The original script by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon was purchased by the studio at the urging of executive producer Michael Douglas, shortly before it optioned Steven Spielberg's Night Skies. Screenwriter Dean Riesner came onto the project in late 1981 after director Mark Rydell left the project due to artistic differences with Douglas. Riesner worked on seven rewrites of Starman with six different directors, but did not receive screen credit because, according to him, \\"the Writers Guild, in their infinite wisdom, decided I didn't contribute 50 percent of the screenplay.\\" Other uncredited writers who worked on the script were Edward Zwick and Diane Thomas. Columbia decided to abandon Night Skies, which was similar in plot to Starman, on the grounds that the former story was a more Disney-like story geared towards children, whereas Starman was for a more mature audience. Night Skies was eventually retitled E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which became the highest-grossing film of its time, upon which Riesner commented, \\"Goes to show how wrong you can be in this business.\\" According to Riesner, producers at Columbia were concerned at the initial box office returns for E.T., feeling that Starman (on whose second rewrite Riesner was working at the time) was too similar. Adrian Lyne had briefly worked on the project before departing to direct Flashdance for Paramount. He was replaced by John Badham, who then left to direct WarGames as soon as he saw E.T., and concurred that the two projects were too similar. Riesner was charged with keeping Starman essentially the same while simultaneously making it distinct from E.T, and would work with three subsequent directors: Tony Scott, Peter Hyams and finally, John Carpenter. Whereas Scott was more interested in style than narrative drive and wanted to cast Philip Anglim, and Hyams pushed for a more conventional science fiction approach, Carpenter, who was eager to shed his image as a maker of exploitative thrillers, wished to emphasize the cross-country rapport that develops between the two leads √† la The Defiant Ones, The 39 Steps, and It Happened One Night over special effects. Riesner dropped the \\"heavy political implications\\" from the script in order to comply with this. Parts of the film were shot in Monument Valley, Utah. Release and reception Starman grossed $2,872,022 in its opening weekend, debuting at number 6. It was released the same week as David Lynch's film Dune and a week after the release of Peter Hyams' film 2010: The Year We Make Contact. The film grossed a total of $28,744,356 from its domestic (US and Canada) run. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that Starman gained an 85% approval rating based on 33 reviews from critics, with the consensus reading: \\"What initially begins as sci-fi transforms into a surprisingly sweet, offbeat drama, courtesy of John Carpenter's careful direction.\\" The aggregator Metacritic gives the film a score of 71% based on 7 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote \\"Starman contains the potential to be a very silly movie, but the two actors have so much sympathy for their characters that the movie, advertised as space fiction, turns into one of 1984's more touching love stories.\\" In a highly positive review praising the film along with its actors and director, critic Janet Maslin stated \\"If Starman doesn't make a major difference in Jeff Bridges' career, Mr. Bridges is operating in the wrong galaxy.\\" Awards and honors Jeff Bridges was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, making Starman the only film by John Carpenter to receive an Academy Award nomination. Bridges was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Drama and was awarded the Saturn Award for Best Actor. Karen Allen also received a nod for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. The film itself was nominated Best Science Fiction Film. Jack Nitzsche received a Golden Globe nomination for his score. The film was nominated for, but does not appear on the following lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: Nominated Science Fiction Film Soundtrack The soundtrack to Starman was released on December 14, 1984. The album also contains a rendition of \\"All I Have to Do Is Dream\\" performed by stars Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen. Home media The film was released Blu-ray on August 11, 2009. Remake In April 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Shawn Levy will direct and produce a remake written by Arash Amel. Michael Douglas, who was a producer of the original, is also on board to produce, while Dan Cohen and Robert Mitas are executive producing, and Matt Milam and Adam North are overseeing the project for Columbia. In popular culture The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra covered \\"Starman Leaves (End Title)\\" for their 2005 cover compilation album, The Science Fiction Album. The 2010 single \\"Symphonies\\" by Dan Black, and its remix featuring Kid Cudi, sampled CoPPO's cover of the song. At the end of the music video the lead character is beamed away by a bright circular spaceship, similar to the manner in which the Starman from the film departs Earth. The music video itself contains scenes which pay homage to several Jeff Bridges films, including Tron and King Kong.

The novel tells the story of Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic British consul in the small Mexican town of Quauhnahuac, on the Day of the Dead, 1 November 1938. The book takes its name from the two volcanoes that overshadow Quauhnahuac and the characters, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. Under the Volcano was Lowry's second and last complete novel. The novel was adapted for radio on Studio One in 1947 but had gone out of print by the time Lowry died. Its popularity restored, in 1984 it served as the basis of a film of the same name. In 1998 the Modern Library ranked Under the Volcano at number 11 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It was included in Modern Library's 100 Best English-Language Novels, Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century, Time's All-Time 100 Novels, and Anthony Burgess' Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English Since 1939. Genesis and publication history Lowry had already published one novel, Ultramarine (1933), by the time he was working on Under the Volcano, and in 1936 wrote a short story called \\"Under the Volcano\\" containing the kernel of the future novel.Spender vii‚Äìviii. That story was not published until the 1960s; passages of it are found also in the account of Sigbjorn Wilderness, found in Dark as the Grave Wherein my Friend Is Laid, edited by Margerie Bonner (Lowry's second wife) and published in 1968. It contains what Conrad Aiken would later call \\"the horse theme,\\" so important in Under the Volcano. The story includes the horse branded with the number seven, the dying Indian encountered while on a bus trip, the pelado who steals the Indian's money to pay his bus fare, and the inability of the spectator (Wilderness in the short story, the Consul in the novel) to act. All this ended up in the novel's eighth chapter.Costa 6‚Äì7. The first version of the novel was developed while Lowry lived in Mexico, frequently drunk and out of control while his first marriage was breaking up.Costa 6. In 1940, Lowry hired an agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for the manuscript but found nothing but rejection‚Äîthis manuscript is referred to by scholars as the 1940 version, and differs in details of various significance from the published version. Between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel (with significant editorial assistance from Margerie Bonner), a process which occupied him completely: during those years Lowry, who had been wont to work on many projects at the same time, worked on nothing but the manuscript,Asals 1‚Äì3. a process documented exhaustively by Frederick Asals. One of the most significant changes involved Yvonne's character: in earlier versions she was the Consul's daughter. By 1940, she was his unfaithful wife, and in that version (and a 1941 revision) chapter 11 ended with her and Hugh making love.Asals 81. In 1944, the manuscript was nearly lost in a fire at the Lowrys' cabin in Dollarton, British Columbia. Margerie Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but all of Lowry's other works in progress were lost in the blaze.Lowry, \\"Introductory Note\\" 6; Lucy and McHoul 6. The burned manuscript was called In Ballast to the White Sea, and would have been the third book in a trilogy made up of Under the Volcano, an expanded version of Lunar Caustic, and In Ballast. Like Dante's Divine Comedy, these were to be infernal, purgatorial, and paradisal, respectively.Breit and Lowry (eds.), Selected Letters 63. Asals notes that the important 1944 revision evidences Lowry and Bonner paying extraordinary attention to references to fire in the novel, especially in Yvonne's dream before her death.Asals 286. The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately sent to different publishers. In late winter, while travelling in Mexico, Lowry learned the novel had been accepted by two publishing companies: Reynal & Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom. Following critical reports from two readers, Cape had reservations about publishing and wrote to Lowry on 29 November 1945 asking him to make drastic revisions, though he added that if Lowry didn't make the revisions \\"it does not necessarily mean I would say no\\".Breit and Lowry (eds.), Selected Letters 424‚Äì25. Lowry's lengthy reply, dated 2 January 1946, was a passionate defence of the book in which he sensed he had created a work of lasting greatness: \\"Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.\\" The letter includes a detailed summary of the book's key themes and how the author intended each of the 12 chapters to work;Breit and Lowry (eds.), Selected Letters 57‚Äì88. in the end, Cape published the novel without further revision. Under the Volcano and Ultramarine were both out of print by the time Lowry died of alcoholism (and possibly sleeping pills) in 1957,Cross 218. but the novel has since made a comeback. In 1998 it was rated as number 11 on the list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century compiled by the Modern Library. TIME included the novel in its list of \\"100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present,\\" calling it a \\"vertiginous picture of self-destruction, seen through the eyes of a man still lucid enough to report to us all the harrowing particulars.\\"Lacayo. Structure and plot Popocat√©petl, from the summit of Iztaccihuatl The book consists of twelve chapters, the first of which introduces the narrative proper and which is set exactly a year after the events. The following eleven chapters happen in a single day and follow the Consul chronologically, starting early on the morning of the Day of the Dead with the return of his wife, Yvonne, who left him the year before, to his violent death at the end of the day. In contrast with the omniscient narrative mode of the 1940 version, the published novel \\"focus[es] each chapter through the mind of one central figure, no two sequential chapters employing the same character's consciousness\\".Asals 80. The number of chapters was important numerologically, as Lowry explained in a letter to Johnathan Cape: there are twelve hours in a day (and most of the novel happens in a single day), twelve months in a year (one year elapses between chapter 1 and the end of chapter 12). Besides, the number 12 is of symbolic importance in the Kabbalah which, according to Lowry, represents \\"man's spiritual aspirations\\". Finally, \\"I have to have my 12\\", Lowry says, since he hears in it \\"a clock slowly striking midnight for Faust\\".Breit and Lowry (eds.), Selected Letters 65‚Äì66. =Chapter 1= In the first chapter, set on 2 November 1939, Jacques Laruelle and Dr. Vigil drink anisette at the Hotel Casino de la Selva, on a hill above Quauhnahuac (an approximation of the Nahuatl name of Cuernavaca), and reminisce on the Consul's presence, exactly a year ago. His alcoholism is discussed and his unhappy marriage; that his wife came back to him is remarked upon as particularly striking. Their conversation over (they are to meet later again that night at a party), Laruelle walks down from the hotel into town through the ruins of a palace of Archduke Maximilian. Along the way he remembers spending a season with the Consul: Laruelle's family and the Consul's adopted family (the Taskersons, consisting of a poetic-minded patriarch and a set of hard-drinking sons) rented adjoining summer homes on the English Channel. Afterward Laruelle spent some time with the Taskersons in England but the friendship soon petered out. Laruelle is scheduled to leave Quauhnahuac the next day, but has not yet packed and does not want to go home, spending his time instead at the Cervecer√≠a XX, a bar connected to the local cinema, run by Sr. Bustamente. At that bar, he is given a book he had borrowed a year and a half before from the Consul‚Äîan anthology of Elizabethan plays he had meant to use for a film on the Faustus myth. Playing a variation on Sortes virgilianae, his eyes fall on the closing words of the chorus in Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, \\"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight...\\", then finds a desperate letter by the Consul to Yvonne, a final plea for her to return, interspersed with descriptions of alcoholic stupor and delirium tremens. Laruelle burns the letter. A bell outside sounds dolente, delor symbolising the closing of the chapter. =Chapter 2= Chapter 2 finds the Consul sitting at the bar of the Bella Vista hotel in Quauhnahuac at 7:00am on 2 November 1938, drinking whisky the morning after the Red Cross ball, when Yvonne enters. The Consul has not been home yet and isn't wearing any socks (as is explained later, his alcoholism is so advanced he cannot put them on). Yvonne has returned to try and save their marriage, but the Consul appears stuck in the past and begins to talk about his visit to Oaxaca, where he went on a drinking binge after Yvonne left. In interior monologue Yvonne wonders if the Consul will be able to return from \\"this stupid darkness\\".Under the Volcano 52. The chapter had opened with an exclamation about a child's corpse being transported by train; the Consul explains that in such cases in Mexico the dead child always needs to be accompanied by an adult, leading to a reference to William Blackstone, \\"the man who went to live among the Indians\\",Under the Volcano 53. a reference the Consul will repeat later on in the day. Yvonne and the Consul leave the hotel and walk through town, along the Palace of Cort√©s, Cuernavaca; they stop at a printer's shop window, their attention drawn by a photograph of a boulder split in two by the elements, an image Yvonne immediately recognises as emblematic of her marriage. On the way to their house in the Calle Nicaragua they stop at Jacques Laruelle's \\"bizarre\\" house, with the inscription No se puede vivir sin amar (\\"one cannot live without loving\\") on the wall, and Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl come into view. The Consul tells Yvonne that Hugh is staying with him as well and is expected back from a trip this very day. As they enter the garden of their house a pariah dog follows them in. =Chapter 3= Yvonne inspects the garden, which has fallen into chaos while she was away, and the Consul is making an attempt to keep up the appearance that he is dealing with his drinking problem. Throughout the chapter, hallucinations, memories, and imaginary conversations interrupt his train of thought, and he hears voices that alternately tell him all is lost and that there is still hope. Dr. Vigil had prescribed him a strychnine concoction which the Consul sips from continuously, all the while trying to resist the temptation to drink whisky. While Yvonne is in the bathroom, however, he leaves the house to visit a cantina but falls facedown in the street, passed out, and is almost run over by an English driver in an MG Magna who offers him Burke's whisky from a flask. While unconscious, memories of Hugh return to him, particularly his having forced Yvonne on him. Back at the house, he enters Yvonne's bedroom but their conversation is halted, in part by the temptation of the bottle of Johnnie Walker he knows is on the patio and in part by hallucinations. An unsuccessful attempt at making love to her establishes his impotence and his despair; afterward, while Yvonne is crying in her room, he murmurs \\"I love you\\"Under the Volcano 95. to his bottle of whisky and falls asleep. =Chapter 4= Much of the chapter takes Hugh's point of view. Hugh arrives at his brother's home and it's understood that he's not wearing any of his own clothes. Because his clothes have been impounded, he wears his brother's jacket, shirt, and bag. He stores his news dispatch in his brother's jacket. References to the Battle of the Ebro are found throughout the chapter, as are mentions of Hugh's friend Juan Cerillo, a Mexican who was in Spain with Hugh. Hugh sees Yvvone at the Consul's home, it's obvious that Yvvone has some hold on his heart. In fact, an affair between the two is alluded to in the chapter. While the Consul is sleeping, Hugh and Yvonne rent horses and ride through the countryside, stopping at a brewery and then at the country estate of Archduke Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, haunted by the memory of Maximilian and his consort Carlota, and of the Consul and Yvonne in happier times. =Chapter 5= While Hugh and Yvonne are out, the Consul endures a \\"horripilating\\" hangover. The chapter begins with a vision of a man suffering unquenchable thirst; while the Consul inspects his garden (the Garden of Eden is referenced throughout, and a snake crosses his path) he finds a bottle of tequila he had hidden, and sees a newly placed sign: LE GUSTA ESTE JARDIN? QUE ES SUYO? EVITE QUE SUS HIJOS LO DESTRUYAN! He mistranslates this as \\"You like this garden? Why is it yours? We evict those who destroy!\\" As he is getting more drunk he has visions of the Farolito, a bar in Parian. He engages his American neighbour, Mr. Quincey, in conversation. Quincey obviously disdains the drunk Consul, who speaks of the garden of Eden and proposes that perhaps Adam's punishment was to continue to live in the Garden of Eden, alone, \\"cut off from God\\". Vigil (also hungover from the Red Cross ball) visits Quincey; he carries a newspaper with headlines of the Battle of the Ebro and the sickness of Pope Pius XI. He then visits the Consul, telling him to stay away from mescal and tequila. Hugh and Yvonne return, and the Consul wakes up from a black-out in the bathroom, slowly remembering the strained conversation during which it is decided that rather than accept Vigil's offer of a day trip to Guanajuato they will go to Tomalin, near Parian. =Chapter 6= Hugh ruminates upon his career as sailor, journalist, and musician, while smoking a cigar. He imagines himself to be a traitor to his \\"journalist friends\\", somehow responsible for the Ebro, and comparable to Adolf Hitler as \\"another frustrated artist\\" and anti-semite. It is revealed that Hugh's signing aboard the S.S. Philoctetes was intended as a publicity stunt to promote his songs, which are to be printed by a Jewish publisher named Bolowski. Doubting his choice, Hugh attempts to escape his journey to sea but is thwarted by the Consul, who wires words of support for Hugh's choice to their aunt. Hugh remembers his time aboard the Philoctetes and, later, the Oedipus Tyrannus, revealing his naivete and bigotry. Back in England, Hugh finds that Bolowski has made \\"No effort [...] to distribute [Hugh's songs]\\". It is further revealed that Hugh cuckolds Bolowski, who raises charges of plagiarism against Hugh. Later, Bolowski drops the charges. Once again in the present, Hugh shaves the Consul, who is suffering from delirium tremens. The two men discuss literature and the occult; their discussion is intermingled with Hugh's ongoing inner monologue. At the end of the chapter, Hugh, Yvonne, the Consul, and Laruelle make their way to Laruelle's home. On the way, the Consul receives a postcard from Yvonne, which she wrote the year before, days after she left him, and which has travelled around the world before reaching Quauhnahuac. =Chapter 7= The four arrive at Jacques Laruelle's home, which features two towers that the Consul compares to both Gothic battlements and the camouflaged smokestacks of the Samaritan. Hugh, Yvonne, and the Consul go upstairs, where the Consul simultaneously struggles to resist drinking and look for his copy of Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays. Yvonne wants to leave from the start, and she soon suggests going to the fiesta before they board the bus to Tomalin. The Consul stays behind as Hugh and Yvonne leave; once the two are gone, Laruelle rounds on him for coming only to drink. The Consul can no longer resist, and does so while Laruelle changes into his tennis clothes for a match with Vigil. They accompany each other down to the fiesta, where the Consul gets himself drunk at a cafe called the Paris while Laruelle tries to lecture him on his drinking. At the fiesta, more mention is made of the Pope's illness and the Battle of the Ebro. Eventually Laruelle leaves, although the Consul is not sure when; he ends up lecturing himself on his drinking problem. Now wandering around to avoid Hugh and Yvonne, he finds an unoccupied ride called the Infernal Machine and is pressured by a gang of children to take the ride. He loses all of his possessions on the ride, which the children gather and return to him. The Consul still has more time to waste, so he stumbles into the Terminal Cantina El Bosque, wherein he chats with the proprietor, Senora Gregorio, and has at least two more drinks. The pariah dog follows him inside but is scared off when he rises. Finally, he walks back outside to find Vigil, Quincey, and Bustamente walking together‚Äîthey do not notice him‚Äîjust as the bus to Tomalin pulls into the station. =Chapter 8= The Consul, Hugh, and Yvonne travel to Tomalin by bus. A number of allusions and symbols are repeated: Las Manos de Orlac, the battle of the Ebro, cigarettes, the Good Samaritan, the number seven, et cetera. Along the way, Hugh notices a dead dog at the bottom of the barranca. During the trip, a pelado on the bus is noted, and Hugh and the Consul debate the meaning of the epithet. Hugh believes the term to mean \\"a shoeless illiterate\\" but the Consul corrects him, claiming that pelados are \\"indeed 'peeled ones,' the stripped, but also those who did not have to be rich to prey on the really poor\\". Further along, Hugh spots a man by the road, seemingly asleep. The bus stops and the man is found to be an Indian dying with his hat covering his face. No one helps the man due to a law that makes any such samaritan liable for \\"accessory after the fact\\". However, the pelado removes the Indian's hat, revealing a head wound and bloodied money. Nearby, Hugh and the Consul spot the recurring horse: \\"branded number seven\\". Leaving the peasant to his fate, the passengers reboard the bus. The Consul directs Hugh to look at the pelado, who is now clutching the \\"bloodstained pile of silver pesos and centavos\\": the pelado has pilfered the Indian's money, and has used it to pay his fare. The Consul, Hugh, and Yvonne take a pinch of habanero,Ackerley and Clipper 149. and the bus rattles on toward Tomalin, where it arrives at the end of the chapter. =Chapter 9= The Consul, Hugh, and Yvonne arrive at Arena Tomalin and take in a bullfight. The narrative references Munro Leaf's Ferdinand the Bull, as the bull does not care to participate in the occasion for much of the event. This chapter offers Yvonne's point of view, including her memories of the Indian that had been injured and the emotion that she feels when reflecting on the volcano, Popocatepetl. As the chapter continues, she reminisces about her childhood and early adulthood in multiple instances; for example, when she claimed to see her father come toward her in a hallucination, when she thinks about her mother‚Äôs death around the time of World War I, and when she discusses her life as an actress in Hollywood. Also, Yvonne dreams of the future she could have had, and would still like to have, with the Consul. Yvonne‚Äôs futuristic dreams included living with the Consul in solidarity and peace with nature. During the bullfight, Hugh decides to jump in and ride the bull while the Consul and Yvonne profess their love for each other in the crowd. =Chapter 10= Told from the Consul's perspective, Chapter 10 opens with Geoffrey having drinks at the Salon Ofelia. He sits at the bar contemplating varieties of liquor while listening to Hugh and Yvonne banter as they swim nearby. They dress in separate changing rooms as the Consul continues to listen to their playful repartee, and they soon join him for dinner. Various landmarks, including the San Francisco Convent, the City Parish and the Tlaxcala Royal Chapel and Sanctuary, are mentioned as the Consul reads a tourist information booklet and remembers places he and Yvonne visited in happier times of their past. The Consul leaves early after arguing politics with Hugh and lashing out against Hugh and Yvonne's concerns about his drinking. =Chapter 11= Hugh and Yvonne leave Salon Ofelia in search of the Consul. They walk in the shadow of the two volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl and come to a point where they must choose one of two paths. Told from Yvonne's perspective, they choose the main path, which they believe the Consul would have taken, since it passes by two cantinas on the way to Parian. Their progress is hindered by a growing thunderstorm and there are numerous references to constellations, such as Orion and the Pleiades. Yvonne is trampled by the horse with the number 7 branded on its leg and imagines seeing her dream house in Canada burn down as she dies. =Chapter 12= The final month of a year, the final number on a clock, and the final chapter of Under the Volcano, told again from the Consul's point of view. He is in the main barroom of the Farolito, which is located at the foot of and seemingly under the volcano Popocatepetl. He does not realise that Hugh and Yvonne are looking for him. Diosdado, also called The Elephant, hands the Consul a stack of letters he has had, which were written by Yvonne and sent to the Consul throughout the past year. The Consul gets into a disagreement with the local police chiefs. They push him outside of the bar and out of the light, where they shoot the Consul and throw him off the edge of the ravine that the Farolito is built atop of. The shot startles a horse which runs off. Characters=Main characters= *Geoffrey Firmin is the alcoholic Consul living in Quauhnahuac. The Consul was born in India, and his mother died when he was young. His father remarried but walked away from his wife, his son Geoffrey, and his newly-born son Hugh, disappearing into the Himalayas. The stepmother dies soon afterward, and the Firmin boys are sent to England and taken in by the Taskersons. A naval officer during World War I, he was court-martialed and subsequently decorated for his actions aboard a submarine destroyer disguised as a merchant vessel (the captured German officers disappeared and were allegedly burned alive in the boiler). His appointment to the consular service is a kind of lateral promotion to get him out of the headlines, and he ends up with the sinecure of a consular position in a Mexican town with no British interests. By the novel's start he is actually an ex-consul: he resigned the service at the time when the UK and Mexico broke up diplomatic relationships in the aftermath of President L√°zaro C√°rdenas's 1938 nationalisation of the country's oil reserves. He wants to write a book on comparative mythology, but his alcoholism dominates all areas of his life. *Yvonne Constable is a former actress, born in Hawaii, who at age 14 began a brief career in the movies, which she abandoned and never picked up again. She has returned to Mexico, after a long absence in the United States, to rekindle her marriage to the Consul. She was married before and had a child, which died young; she may have had affairs with Hugh Firmin and Jacques Laruelle. *Hugh Firmin who had interrupted his career as a singer-songwriter in England for a year at sea, is Geoffrey's half-brother and a child-prodigy like Yvonne. After returning to England, he falls in with the political left and supports the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He visits Mexico to report on fascist activity for the London Globe, and is to leave the next day, to board a ship bringing ammunition to the Spanish government forces. There are frequent allusions in later chapters to an earlier affair between Hugh and Yvonne. *Jacques Laruelle (usually referred to as \\"M. Laruelle\\"), a French film director and childhood friend of the Consul. Born in the Moselle area, he grew up in Paris and became acquainted with the Consul during the summer of 1911 in the beach resort of Courseulles-sur-Mer, on the Channel. Independently of the Consul he has also moved to Quauhnahuac, and like Hugh has an affair with Yvonne. He is 42 when the novel starts and is preparing to leave Mexico. =Secondary characters= *Dr. Arturo D√≠az Vigil, a local physician, friend of the Consul and Laruelle. *Sr. Bustamente, owner of the local cinema. *Se√±ora Gregorio, owner of the Terminal Cantina El Bosque, a bar in Quauhnahuac. *The Taskersons, the Consul's adoptive family; the patriarch, a poet named Abraham Taskerson, took Geoffrey in as a fifteen-year-old brooding poet. The entire family, including the mother and the at least six sons, drinks hard and takes long walks in the countryside around their home, across the River Mersey and with a view of the Welsh mountains. *Juan Cerillo, a Mexican national who was in Spain with Hugh and is now an agent for a cooperative holding made possible by the nationalisations of president L√°zaro C√°rdenas: he transports money between rural cooperatives and farmers and the national Credit Bank (much like the murdered Indian in Chapter VII).Middlebro par. 7. Cerillo is modelled on a real-life friend of Lowry's, Juan Fernando M√°rquez, whom he befriended during his 1936‚Äì1938 stay in Mexico and who also appears in Dark as the Grave Wherein my Friend is Laid.McCarthy 328 n.9. Symbolism and allusion Under the Volcano is particularly rich in symbolism; references and allusions to other writers and literary works abound. The influence of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus runs throughout the novel, and references to Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal, William Shakespeare's tragedies, and Dante's Divine Comedy enrich the novel's meaning. =Marlowe and Doctor Faustus= Critics have remarked that Marlowe's version of the Faustus myth is \\"Lowry's single most important source for Under the Volcano\\".Ackerley and Clipper 48. Lowry alludes to Goethe's Faust as well and uses a quote for one of his three epigraphs but Marlowe's dominates, with the Consul being suggested as a Faustian black magician by Hugh. The Consul \\"often associates himself with Faustus as a suffering soul who cannot ask for salvation, or who even runs toward hell\\", and parodies Marlowe's line about Helen of Troy (\\"was this the face that launched a thousand ships, / and burnt the topless towers of Illium?\\"Marlowe 5.2.97‚Äì98.) when looking at a fighting cock in a bar, \\"Was this the face that launched five hundred ships, and betrayed Christ into being in the Western Hemisphere?\\"McCarthy 57. A literary game based on the Sortes virgilianae‚Äîa form of divination by bibliomancy in which advice or predictions of the future are sought by randomly selecting a passage from Virgil's Aeneid, but with Shakespeare replacing Virgil‚Äîis an important theme. The Consul (who \\"had delighted in the absurd game\\"Under the Volcano 36.) refers to the game in chapter 7 using Jean Cocteau's The Infernal MachineUnder the Volcano 218. Exactly a year later Laruelle plays it again, this time with the Consul's copy of Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays. After two lines and then another from Doctor Faustus and a passage from Thomas Dekker's The Shoemaker's Holiday,Ackerley and Clipper 60. the book opens on the last page of Doctor Faustus, and the four lines Laruelle reads are particularly appropriate to the Consul: \\"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight, ... Faustus is gone: regard his hellish fall.\\" =Others= Many of the individual symbols in the novel relate to each other and to Lowry's literary models. The Consul's wild and overgrown garden, which stands for his life,Costa 7. alludes to the Garden of Eden; the barranca symbolises and becomes his tomb.Costa 8. Throughout the novel the number 7 appears‚Äîbranded on the horse which is encountered in many of the chapters, and often as time: Laruelle's Day of the Dead, in the first chapter, ends at 7 PM; Yvonne returns to the Consul at 7 AM and the day that takes up chapters 2 through 12 ends at 7 PM; at the novel's close, the clock strikes seven times and a cock appears to confirm the Indian belief that \\"a cock crowing seven times announces death\\", while the clock also announces the opening of the seventh seal.Costa 7, Doyer 73. Literary significance and critical reception  An early review of the book, by R. W. Flint in The Kenyon Review, called it \\"one of the most readable novels to appear since the war\\" but ultimately criticised it severely for its \\"second-handedness\\", saying that Lowry \\"lacks the confidence of the innovator\\".Flint 474. Fellow writer Charles Bukowski, said that when he read Lowry's novel \\"I yawned myself to shit\\". He criticised it for lack of \\"pace, quickness, light, sunlight, juice and flavour in his lines.\\" Michael Hofmann, who would edit the collection of posthumous work of Lowry's The Voyage That Never Ends, wrote, \\"Under the Volcano eats light like a black hole. It is a work of such gravity and connectedness and spectroscopic richness that it is more world than product. It is absolute mass, agglomeration of consciousness and experience and terrific personal grace. It has planetary swagger.\\" In The New York Review of Books, critic Michael Wood wrote, \\"Under the Volcano is a great book about missing grandeur, about the specialised tragedy that lies in the unavailability of the tragedy you want.\\" Chris Power, writing in The Guardian, said: \\" I came to the book knowing only its reputation as a masterpiece of English modernism. I left thinking it one of the greatest novels of the 20th century... Lowry is closer to Melville and Conrad than Joyce, but he creates his corner of Mexico in a manner similar to the Dublin of Ulysses: not by describing it so much as by building an alternate reality from language.\\" Novelist Elizabeth Lowry (no relation), writing in the London Review of Books, described it as a \\"black masterpiece about the horrors of alcoholic disintegration.\\" Reviewing Gordon Bowker's biography of Lowry, The New York Times commented on Volcano's legacy: \\"Under the Volcano is too famous to be just a cult object, but more than most great novels it is revisited year after year by a few zealous defenders, who place Lowry high up in the modernist pantheon, while the rest of the world is only barely aware of his masterpiece as an exotic and harrowing read.\\" Modern Library's 100 Best Novels of English novels in the 20th century lists the book at position 11. It was ranked number 99 on Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. In other media John Huston directed the 1984 film adaptation, with Albert Finney, Jacqueline Bisset, Anthony Andrews and Katy Jurado. It received Oscar nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Albert Finney) and Best Music, Original Score. Volcano: An Inquiry Into the Life and Death of Malcolm Lowry (1976) is a National Film Board of Canada documentary produced by Donald Brittain and Robert A. Duncan and directed by Brittain and John Kramer. It opens with the inquest into Lowry's \\"death by misadventure,\\" and then moves back in time to trace the writer's life. Selections from Lowry's novel are read by Richard Burton amid images shot in Mexico, the United States, Canada and England. The novel was the inspiration for the 1971 song \\"The Consul At Sunset\\" by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, as well as the 1987 song \\"Back Room of the Bar\\" by The Young Fresh Fellows.

It is threatened by habitat destruction and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2010. It is the world's longest venomous snake. Adult king cobras are long on average. The longest known individual measured . It is the sole member of the genus Ophiophagus. It preys chiefly on other snakes and occasionally on some other vertebrates, such as lizards and rodents. It is a highly venomous and dangerous snake when agitated or provoked that has a fearsome reputation in its range, although it is typically shy and avoids confrontation with humans when possible. The king cobra is a prominent symbol in the mythology and folk traditions of India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. It is the national reptile of India.  Taxonomy  Hamadryas hannah was the scientific name used by Danish naturalist Theodore Edward Cantor in 1836 who described four king cobra specimens, three captured in the Sundarbans and one in the vicinity of Kolkata. Naja bungarus was proposed by Hermann Schlegel in 1837 who described a king cobra zoological specimen from Java. In 1838, Cantor proposed the name Hamadryas ophiophagus for the king cobra and explained that it has dental features intermediate between the genera Naja and Bungarus. Naia vittata proposed by Walter Elliot in 1840 was a king cobra caught offshore near Chennai that was floating in a basket. Hamadryas elaps proposed by Albert G√ºnther in 1858 were king cobra specimens from the Philippines and Borneo. G√ºnther considered both N. bungarus and N. vittata a variety of H. elaps. The genus Ophiophagus was proposed by G√ºnther in 1864. The name is derived from its propensity to eat snakes. Naja ingens proposed by Alexander Willem Michiel van Hasselt in 1882 was a king cobra captured near Tebing Tinggi in northern Sumatra. Ophiophagus hannah was accepted as the valid name for the king cobra by Charles Mitchill Bogert in 1945 who argued that it differs significantly from Naja species. A genetic analysis using cytochrome b, and a multigene analysis showed that the king cobra was an early offshoot of a genetic lineage giving rise to the mambas, rather than the Naja cobras. A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that specimens from Surattani and Nakhon Si Thammarat Provinces in southern Thailand form a deeply divergent clade from those from northern Thailand, which grouped with specimens from Myanmar and Guangdong in southern China.  Description  Scales of the king cobra A baby king cobra showing its chevron pattern on the back The king cobra's skin is olive green with black and white bands on the trunk that converge to the head. The head is covered by 15 drab coloured and black edged shields. The muzzle is rounded, and the tongue black. It has two fangs and 3‚Äì5 maxillar teeth in the upper jaw, and two rows of teeth in the lower jaw. The nostrils are between two shields. The large eyes have a golden iris and round pupils. Its hood is oval shaped and covered with olive green smooth scales and two black spots between the two lowest scales. Its cylindrical tail is yellowish green above and marked with black. It has a pair of large occipital scales on top of the head, 17 to 19 rows of smooth oblique scales on the neck, and 15 rows on the body. Juveniles are black with chevron shaped white, yellow or buff bars that point towards the head. Adult king cobras are long. The longest known individual measured . Ventral scales are uniformly oval shaped. Dorsal scales are placed in an oblique arrangement. The king cobra is sexually dimorphic, with males being larger and paler in particular during the breeding season. Males captured in Kerala measured up to and weighed up to . Females captured had a maximum length of and a weight of . The largest known king cobra was long and captured in Thailand. It differs from other cobra species by size and hood. It is larger, has a narrower and longer stripe on the neck. The head of a mature snake can be quite massive and bulky in appearance. Like all snakes, it can expand its jaws to swallow large prey items. It has proteroglyph dentition, meaning it has two short, fixed fangs in the front of the mouth, which channel venom into the prey. These are behind the usual \\"nine-plate\\" arrangement typical of colubrids and elapids, and are unique to the king cobra. The king cobra typically weighs about . A captive one at the London Zoo grew to before being euthanised upon the outbreak of World War II. The heaviest wild specimen was caught at Royal Island Club in Singapore in 1951, which weighed and measured . An individual kept at Bronx Zoo weighed and was long in 1972.  Distribution and habitat  The king cobra has a wide distribution in South and Southeast Asia. It occurs up to an elevation of from the Terai in India and southern Nepal to the Brahmaputra River basin in Bhutan and northeast India, Bangladesh and to Myanmar, southern China, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. In northern India, it has been recorded in Garhwal and Kumaon, and in the Shivalik and terai regions of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. In northeast India, the king cobra has been recorded in northern West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. In the Eastern Ghats, it occurs from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to coastal Odisha, and also in Bihar and southern West Bengal, especially the Sunderbans. In the Western Ghats, it was recorded in Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra, and also in Gujarat. It also occurs on Baratang Island in the Great Andaman chain.  Behaviour and ecology Like other snakes, a king cobra receives chemical information via its forked tongue, which picks up scent particles and transfers them to a sensory receptor (Jacobson's organ) located in the roof of its mouth. When it detects the scent of prey, it flicks its tongue to gauge the prey's location, with the twin forks of the tongue acting in stereo. It senses earth-borne vibration and detects moving prey almost away. Following envenomation, it swallows its prey whole. Because of its flexible jaws it can swallow prey much larger than its head. It is considered diurnal because it hunts during the day, but has also been seen at night, rarely. = Diet = King cobra in Pune, India The king cobra's diet consists primarily of other snakes and lizards, including Indian cobra, banded krait, rat snake, pythons, green whip snake, keelback, banded wolf snake and Blyth's reticulated snake. It also hunts Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed pit viper by following their odour trails. In Singapore, one was observed swallowing a clouded monitor. When food is scarce, it also feeds on other small vertebrates, such as birds, and lizards. In some cases, the cobra constricts its prey using its muscular body, though this is uncommon. After a large meal, it lives for many months without another one because of its slow metabolic rate. = Defence = A king cobra in its defensive posture (mounted specimen at the Royal Ontario Museum) The king cobra is not considered aggressive. It usually slinks off when disturbed, but is known to aggressively defend incubating eggs and attack intruders rapidly. When alarmed, it raises the front part of its body, extends the hood, shows the fangs and hisses loudly. When biting, it retains its grip for up to eight minutes. Wild king cobras encountered in Singapore appeared to be placid, but reared up and struck in self defence when cornered. Most victims bitten by king cobras are snake charmers. Hospital records in Thailand indicate that bites from king cobras are very uncommon. It can be easily irritated by closely approaching objects or sudden movements. When raising its body, the king cobra can still move forward to strike with a long distance, and people may misjudge the safe zone. It can deliver multiple bites in a single attack. = Growling hiss = The hiss of the king cobra is a much lower pitch than many other snakes and many people thus liken its call to a \\"growl\\" rather than a hiss. While the hisses of most snakes are of a broad-frequency span ranging from roughly 3,000 to 13,000 Hz with a dominant frequency near 7,500 Hz, king cobra growls consist solely of frequencies below 2,500 Hz, with a dominant frequency near 600 Hz, a much lower-sounding frequency closer to that of a human voice. Comparative anatomical morphometric analysis has led to a discovery of tracheal diverticula that function as low-frequency resonating chambers in king cobra and its prey, the rat snake, both of which can make similar growls. = Reproduction = A captive juvenile king cobra in its defensive posture The female is gravid for 50 to 59 days. The king cobra is the only snake that builds a nest using dry leaf litter, starting from late March to late May. Most nests are located at the base of trees, are up to high in the center and wide at the base. They consist of several layers and have mostly one chamber, into which the female lays eggs. Clutch size ranges from 7 to 43 eggs, with 6 to 38 eggs hatching after incubation periods of 66 to 105 days. Temperature inside nests is not steady but varies depending on elevation from . Females stay by their nests between two and 77 days. Hatchlings are between long and weigh . The venom of hatchlings is as potent as that of the adults. They may be brightly marked, but these colours often fade as they mature. They are alert and nervous, being highly aggressive if disturbed. The average lifespan of a wild king cobra is about 20 years.  Venom  King cobra skull, lateral view, showing fangs The king cobra's venom consists of cytotoxins and neurotoxins, including alpha-neurotoxins and three-finger toxins. Other components have cardiotoxic effects. It can deliver up to 420 mg venom in dry weight per bite, with a toxicity in mice of 1.28 mg/kg through intravenous injection, 1.5 to 2.18 mg/kg through subcutaneous injection, and 1.644 mg/kg through intraperitoneal injection. The toxins affect the victim's central nervous system, resulting in severe pain, blurred vision, vertigo, drowsiness, and eventually paralysis. If the envenomation is serious, it progresses to cardiovascular collapse, and the victim falls into a coma. Death soon follows due to respiratory failure. The affected person can die within 30 minutes of envenomation. Ohanin, a protein component of the venom, causes hypolocomotion and hyperalgesia in mammals. Large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms. Polyvalent antivenom of equine origin is produced by Haffkine Institute and King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research in India. A polyvalent antivenom produced by the Thai Red Cross Society can effectively neutralize venom of the king cobra. In Thailand, a concoction of turmeric root has been clinically shown to create a strong resilience against the venom of the king cobra when ingested. Proper and immediate treatments are critical to avoid death. Successful precedents include a client who recovered and was discharged in 10 days after being treated by accurate antivenom and inpatient care. Not all king cobra bites result in envenomation, but they are often considered of medical importance. Clinical mortality rates vary between different regions and depend on many factors, such as local medical advancement. A Thai survey reports 10 deaths out of 35 patients received for king cobra bites, whose fatality rate posed (28%) is higher than those of other cobra species. The Department of Clinical Toxinology of the University of Adelaide gives this serpent a general untreated fatality rate of 50‚Äì60%, implying that the snake has about a half chance to deliver bites involving nonfatal quantities of venom.  Threats  In Southeast Asia, the king cobra is threatened foremost by habitat destruction owing to deforestation and expansion of agricultural land. It is also threatened by poaching for its meat, skin and for use in traditional Chinese medicine.  Conservation  The king cobra is listed in CITES Appendix II. It is protected in China and Vietnam. In India, it is placed under Schedule II of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Killing a king cobra is punished with imprisonment of up to six years.  Cultural significance  Cobra stone or gem or pearl A ritual in Myanmar involves a king cobra and a female snake charmer. The charmer is a priestess who is usually tattooed with three pictograms and kisses the snake on the top of its head at the end of the ritual. Members of the Pakokku clan tattoo themselves with ink mixed with cobra venom on their upper bodies in a weekly inoculation that potentially might protect them from the snake, though no scientific evidence supports this. Cobra stones or pearls are believed by tantrikas to develop from the cobra's hood.

The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, about long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word oesophagus is from Ancient Greek Œø·º∞œÉŒøœÜŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ (oisoph√°gos), from Œø·º¥œÉœâ (o√≠s≈ç), future form of œÜŒ≠œÅœâ (ph√©r≈ç, ‚ÄúI carry‚Äù) + ·ºîœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒøŒΩ (√©phagon, ‚ÄúI ate‚Äù). The wall of the esophagus from the lumen outwards consists of mucosa, submucosa (connective tissue), layers of muscle fibers between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective tissue. The mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium of around three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the single layer of columnar cells of the stomach. The transition between these two types of epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. Most of the muscle is smooth muscle although striated muscle predominates in its upper third. It has two muscular rings or sphincters in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The esophagus has a rich blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves (sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic trunk and parasympathetic nerves via the vagus nerve) and in addition voluntary nerves (lower motor neurons) which are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle. The esophagus may be affected by gastric reflux, cancer, prominent dilated blood vessels called varices that can bleed heavily, tears, constrictions, and disorders of motility. Diseases may cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), painful swallowing (odynophagia), chest pain, or cause no symptoms at all. Clinical investigations include X-rays when swallowing barium, endoscopy, and CT scans. Surgically, the esophagus is difficult to access. Structure The esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins at the back of the mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25 cm (10 in) in length. Many blood vessels serve the esophagus, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper parts of the esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, the parts of the esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, with the exception of the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes. ;Position The upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm. The thoracic duct, which drains the majority of the body's lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in the lower part of the esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus. ;Constrictions alt=Diagram showing the four constrictions of the esophagus. The esophagus has four points of constriction. When a corrosive substance, or a solid object is swallowed, it is most likely to lodge and damage one of these four points. These constrictions arise from particular structures that compress the esophagus. These constrictions are: * At the start of the esophagus, where the laryngopharynx joins the esophagus, behind the cricoid cartilage * Where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in the superior mediastinum * Where the esophagus is compressed by the left main bronchus in the posterior mediastinum * The esophageal hiatus where it passes through the diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum =Sphincters= The esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed. The upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter, which is formed by lower portion of inferior pharyngeal constrictor, also known as cricopharyngeal sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly. However, the lower esophageal sphincter is not an anatomical but rather a functional sphincter, meaning that it acts as a sphincter but does not have a distinct thickening like other sphincters. The upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor. The lower esophageal sphincter, or gastroesophageal sphincter, surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal reflux, which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa. =Nerve supply= The esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying the muscles of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk. =Gastro-esophageal junction= The gastro- esophageal junction (also known as the esophagogastric junction) is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach, at the lower end of the esophagus. The pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa, and the mucosal transition can be seen as an irregular zig-zag line, which is often called the z-line. Histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach. Normally, the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia; however, when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in Barrets esophagus the true gastro-eshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition. The functional location of the lower oesophageal sphincter is generally situated about below the z-line. =Microanatomy= The human esophagus has a mucous membrane consisting of a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There are two types of glands, with mucus- secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells that is part of the enteric nervous system. The muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa. Development In early embryogenesis, the esophagus develops from the endodermal primitive gut tube. The ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac. During the second week of embryological development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround parts of the sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. The sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline arteries. Over time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. The areas supplied by these arteries are used to define the midgut, hindgut and foregut. The surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops as part of the foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches. Function=Swallowing= Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes. =Reducing gastric reflux= The stomach produces gastric acid, a strongly acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters helps to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. The acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm also help this sphincteric action.  Gene and protein expression  About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia. Clinical significance The main conditions affecting the esophagus are described here. For a more complete list, see esophageal disease. =Inflammation= Inflammation of the esophagus is known as esophagitis. Reflux of gastric acids from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications (such as bisphosphonates), and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis. Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the yeast Candida albicans that may occur when a person is immunocompromised. the cause of some forms of esophagitis, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, is not known. Esophagitis can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection. = Barrett's esophagus = Prolonged esophagitis, particularly from gastric reflux, is one factor thought to play a role in the development of Barrett's esophagus. In this condition, there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus, which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia. Barrett's esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer. =Cancer= There are two main types of cancer of the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma is a carcinoma that can occur in the squamous cells lining the esophagus. This type is much more common in China and Iran. The other main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus. This is most common in developed countries in those with Barrett's esophagus, and occurs in the cuboidal cells. In its early stages, esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases in different parts of the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment. =Varices= Esophageal varices are swollen twisted branches of the azygous vein in the lower third of the esophagus. These blood vessels anastomose (join up) with those of the portal vein when portal hypertension develops. These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus. These blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension, usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis. This collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the esophagus drains into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices. Esophageal varices often do not have symptoms until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency, because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding varix may cause a person to vomit blood, or suffer shock. To deal with a ruptured varix, a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or a small amount of a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. IV fluids and blood products may be given in order to prevent hypovolemia from excess blood loss. =Motility disorders= Several disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia refers to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis. =Malformations= Esophageal strictures are usually benign and typically develop after a person has had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula ‚Äì an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly. =Imaging= A mass seen during an endoscopy and an ultrasound of the mass conducted during the endoscopy session. An X-ray of swallowed barium may be used to reveal the size and shape of the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used. History The word esophagus (British English: oesophagus), comes from the () meaning gullet. It derives from two roots (eosin) to carry and () to eat. The use of the word oesophagus, has been documented in anatomical literature since at least the time of Hippocrates, who noted that \\"the oesophagus ... receives the greatest amount of what we consume.\\" Its existence in other animals and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (AD23‚ÄìAD79), and the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus have been documented since at least the time of Galen. The first attempt at surgery on the esophagus focused in the neck, and was conducted in dogs by Theodore Billroth in 1871. In 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people. By 1908, an operation had been performed by Voeckler to remove the esophagus, and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus, (to control esophageal cancer), had been conducted. The Nissen fundoplication, in which the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to stimulate its function and control reflux, was first conducted by Rudolph Nissen in 1955. Other animals=Vertebrates= In tetrapods, the pharynx is much shorter, and the esophagus correspondingly longer, than in fish. In the majority of vertebrates, the esophagus is simply a connecting tube, but in some birds, which regurgitate components to feed their young, it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach. In ruminants, animals with four stomachs, a groove called the sulcus reticuli is often found in the esophagus, allowing milk to drain directly into the hind stomach, the abomasum. In the horse the esophagus is about in length, and carries food to the stomach. A muscular ring, called the cardiac sphincter, connects the stomach to the esophagus. This sphincter is very well developed in horses. This and the oblique angle at which the esophagus connects to the stomach explains why horses cannot vomit. The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from the condition known as choke. The esophagus of snakes is remarkable for the distension it undergoes when swallowing prey. In most fish, the esophagus is extremely short, primarily due to the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer. In many vertebrates, the esophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, the esophagus is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, in addition to the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found. The muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, it is entirely striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and birds. Contrary to popular belief, an adult human body would not be able to pass through the esophagus of a whale, which generally measures less than in diameter, although in larger baleen whales it may be up to when fully distended. =Invertebrates= A structure with the same name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.Appleton C. C., Forbes A. T.& Demetriades N. T. (2009). \\"The occurrence, bionomics and potential impacts of the invasive freshwater snail Tarebia granifera (Lamarck, 1822) (Gastropoda: Thiaridae) in South Africa\\" . Zoologische Mededelingen 83. In the cephalopods, the brain often surrounds the esophagus.

The stool is often hard and dry. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older. Treatment of constipation depends on the underlying cause and the duration that it has been present. Measures that may help include drinking enough fluids, eating more fiber, and exercise. If this is not effective, laxatives of the bulk forming agent, osmotic agent, stool softener, or lubricant type may be recommended. Stimulant laxatives are generally reserved for when other types are not effective. Other treatments may include biofeedback or in rare cases surgery. In the general population rates of constipation are 2‚Äì30 percent. Among elderly people living in a care home the rate of constipation is 50‚Äì75 percent. People spend, in the United States, more than on medications for constipation a year. Definition Bristol stool chart Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Most commonly, constipation is thought of as infrequent bowel movements, usually less than 3 stools per week.\\"Constipation\\" . eMedicine. However, people may have other complaints as well including: * Straining with bowel movements * Excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement * Hard stools * Pain with bowel movements secondary to straining * Abdominal pain * Abdominal bloating. * the sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation. The Rome III Criteria are a set of symptoms that help standardize the diagnosis of constipation in various age groups. These criteria help physicians to better define constipation in a standardized manner. Causes The causes of constipation can be divided into congenital, primary, and secondary. The most common kind is primary and not life- threatening. It can also be divided by the age group affected such as children and adults. Primary or functional constipation is defined by ongoing symptoms for greater than six months not due to an underlying cause such as medication side effects or an underlying medical condition. It is not associated with abdominal pain, thus distinguishing it from irritable bowel syndrome. It is the most common kind of constipation, and is often multifactorial. In adults, such primary causes include: dietary choices such as insufficient dietary fiber or fluid intake, or behavioral causes such as decreased physical activity. In the elderly, common causes have been attributed to insufficient dietary fiber intake, inadequate fluid intake, decreased physical activity, side effects of medications, hypothyroidism, and obstruction by colorectal cancer. Evidence to support these factors however is poor. Secondary causes include side effects of medications such as opiates, endocrine and metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism, and obstruction such as from colorectal cancer. Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity may also present with constipation. Cystocele can develop as a result of chronic constipation. =Diet= Constipation can be caused or exacerbated by a low-fiber diet, low liquid intake, or dieting. Dietary fiber helps to decrease colonic transport time, increases stool bulk but simultaneously softens stool. Therefore, diets low in fiber can lead to primary constipation. =Medications= Many medications have constipation as a side effect. Some include (but are not limited to) opioids, diuretics, antidepressants, antihistamines, antispasmodics, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrythmics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, anti-diarrheals, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron, and aluminum antacids. Certain calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and verapamil can cause severe constipation due to dysfunction of motility in the rectosigmoid colon. Supplements such as calcium and iron supplements can also have constipation as a notable side effect. =Medical conditions= Metabolic and endocrine problems which may lead to constipation include: hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, porphyria, chronic kidney disease, pan-hypopituitarism, diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis. Constipation is also common in individuals with muscular and myotonic dystrophy. Systemic diseases that may present with constipation include celiac disease and systemic sclerosis. Constipation has a number of structural (mechanical, morphological, anatomical) causes, namely through creating space-occupying lesions within the colon that stop the passage of stool, such as colorectal cancer, strictures, rectocoles, anal sphincter damage or malformation and post-surgical changes. Extra-intestinal masses such as other malignancies can also lead to constipation from external compression. Constipation also has neurological causes, including anismus, descending perineum syndrome, and Hirschsprung's disease. In infants, Hirschsprung's disease is the most common medical disorder associated with constipation. Anismus occurs in a small minority of persons with chronic constipation or obstructed defecation. Spinal cord lesions and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and pelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to constipation. =Psychological= Voluntary withholding of the stool is a common cause of constipation. The choice to withhold can be due to factors such as fear of pain, fear of public restrooms, or laziness. When a child holds in the stool a combination of encouragement, fluids, fiber, and laxatives may be useful to overcome the problem. Early intervention with withholding is important as this can lead to anal fissures. = Congenital = A number of diseases present at birth can result in constipation in children. They are as a group uncommon with Hirschsprung's disease (HD) being the most common. There are also congenital structural anomalies that can lead to constipation, including anterior displacement of the anus, imperforate anus, strictures, and small left colon syndrome. PathothysiologyDiagnostic approach Significant constipation in the plain X-ray of an 8-year-old The diagnosis is typically made based on a person's description of the symptoms. Bowel movements that are difficult to pass, very firm, or made up of small hard pellets (like those excreted by rabbits) qualify as constipation, even if they occur every day. Constipation is traditionally defined as three or fewer bowel movements per week. Other symptoms related to constipation can include bloating, distension, abdominal pain, headaches, a feeling of fatigue and nervous exhaustion, or a sense of incomplete emptying.\\"Constipation\\" MedicineNet Although constipation may be a diagnosis, it is typically viewed as a symptom that requires evaluation to discern a cause. = Description = Distinguish between acute (days to weeks) or chronic (months to years) onset of constipation because this information changes the differential diagnosis. This in the context of accompanied symptoms helps physicians discover the cause of constipation. People often describe their constipation as bowel movements that are difficult to pass, firm stool with lumpy or hard consistency, and excessive straining during bowel movements. Bloating, abdominal distension, and abdominal pain often accompany constipation. Chronic constipation (symptoms present at least three days per month for more than three months) associated with abdominal discomfort is often diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) when no obvious cause is found. Poor dietary habits, previous abdominal surgeries, and certain medical conditions can contribute to constipation. Diseases associated with constipation include hypothyroidism, certain types of cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. Low fiber intake, inadequate amounts of fluids, poor ambulation or immobility, or medications can contribute to constipation. Once the presence of constipation is identified based on a culmination of the symptoms described above, then the cause of the constipation should be figured out. Separating non-life- threatening from serious causes may be partly based on symptoms. For example, colon cancer may be suspected if a person has a family history of colon cancer, fever, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. Other alarming signs and symptoms include family or personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, age of onset over 50, change in stool caliber, nausea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms like weakness, numbness and difficulty urinating. = Examination = A physical examination should involve at least an abdominal exam and rectal exam. Abdominal exam may reveal an abdominal mass if there is significant stool burden and may reveal abdominal discomfort. Rectal examination gives an impression of the anal sphincter tone and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, the presence of hemorrhoids, blood and whether any perineal irregularities are present including skin tags, fissures, anal warts. Physical examination is done manually by a physician and is used to guide which diagnostic tests to order. = Diagnostic tests = Functional constipation is common and does not warrant diagnostic testing. Imaging and laboratory tests are typically recommended for those with alarm signs or symptoms. The laboratory tests performed depends on the suspected underlying cause of the constipation. Tests may include CBC (complete blood count), thyroid function tests, serum calcium, serum potassium, etc. Abdominal X-rays are generally only performed if bowel obstruction is suspected, may reveal extensive impacted fecal matter in the colon, and may confirm or rule out other causes of similar symptoms. Colonoscopy may be performed if an abnormality in the colon like a tumor is suspected. Other tests rarely ordered include anorectal manometry, anal sphincter electromyography, and defecography. Colonic propagating pressure wave sequences (PSs) are responsible for discrete movements of the bowel contents and are vital for normal defecation. Deficiencies in PS frequency, amplitude, and extent of propagation are all implicated in severe defecatory dysfunction (SDD). Mechanisms that can normalize these aberrant motor patterns may help rectify the problem. Recently the novel therapy of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has been utilized for the treatment of severe constipation. =Criteria= The Rome III Criteria for functional constipation must include two or more of the following and present for the past three months, with symptoms starting for at least 6 months prior to diagnosis. * Straining during defecation for at least 25% of bowel movements * Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations * Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations * Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations * Manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations * Fewer than 3 defecations per week * Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives * There are insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome Prevention Constipation is usually easier to prevent than to treat. Following the relief of constipation, maintenance with adequate exercise, fluid intake, and high-fiber diet is recommended. Treatment A limited number of causes require urgent medical intervention or will result in severe consequences. The treatment of constipation should focus on the underlying cause if known. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) break constipation in adults into two categories - chronic constipation of unknown cause and constipation due to opiates. In chronic constipation of unknown cause, the main treatment involves the increased intake of water and fiber (either dietary or as supplements). The routine use of laxatives or enemas is discouraged, as having bowel movements may come to be dependent upon their use. = Fiber supplements = Soluble fiber supplements such as psyllium are generally considered first- line treatment for chronic constipation, compared to insoluble fibers such as wheat bran. Side effects of fiber supplements include bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and possible malabsorption of iron, calcium, and some medications. However, patients with opiate-induced constipation will likely not benefit from fiber supplements. =Laxatives= If laxatives are used, milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol are recommended as first-line agents due to their low cost and safety. Stimulants should only be used if this is not effective. In cases of chronic constipation, polyethylene glycol appears superior to lactulose. Prokinetics may be used to improve gastrointestinal motility. A number of new agents have shown positive outcomes in chronic constipation; these include prucalopride and lubiprostone. Cisapride is widely available in third world countries, but has been withdrawn in most of the west. It has not been shown to have a benefit on constipation, while potentially causing cardiac arrhythmias and deaths. =Enemas= Enemas can be used to provide a form of mechanical stimulation. A large volume or high enema can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces, and the solution administered commonly contains castile soap which irritates the colon's lining resulting in increased urgency to defecate. However, a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract. =Physical intervention= Constipation that resists the above measures may require physical intervention such as manual disimpaction (the physical removal of impacted stool using the hands; see fecal impaction). Regular exercise can help improve chronic constipation. = Surgical intervention = In refractory cases, procedures can be performed to help relieve constipation. Sacral nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to be effective in a minority of cases. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is another intervention performed only in patients known to have a slow colonic transit time and in whom a defecation disorder has either been treated or is not present. Because this is a major operation, side effects can include considerable abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction, and post-surgical infections. Furthermore, it has a very variable rate of success and is very case dependent. Prognosis Complications that can arise from constipation include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal prolapse, and fecal impaction.National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse. (2007) NIH Publication No. 07‚Äì2754. http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/constipation/#treatment , Retrieved 7-18-2010. Straining to pass stool may lead to hemorrhoids. In later stages of constipation, the abdomen may become distended, hard and diffusely tender. Severe cases (\\"fecal impaction\\" or malignant constipation) may exhibit symptoms of bowel obstruction (nausea, vomiting, tender abdomen) and encopresis, where soft stool from the small intestine bypasses the mass of impacted fecal matter in the colon. Epidemiology Constipation is the most common chronic gastrointestinal disorder in adults. Depending on the definition employed, it occurs in 2% to 20% of the population. It is more common in women, the elderly and children. Specifically constipation with no known cause affects females more often affected than males. The reasons it occurs more frequently in the elderly is felt to be due to an increasing number of health problems as humans age and decreased physical activity. * 12% of the population worldwide reports having constipation. *Chronic constipation accounts for 3% of all visits annually to pediatric outpatient clinics. *Constipation-related health care costs total $6.9 billion in the US annually. *More than four million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year. *Around $725 million is spent on laxative products each year in America. History 19th century satirical cartoon of a monkey rejecting an old style clyster for a new design, filled with marshmallow and opium Since ancient times different societies have published medical opinions about how health care providers should respond to constipation in patients. In various times and places, doctors have made claims that constipation has all sorts of medical or social causes. Doctors in history have treated constipation in reasonable and unreasonable ways, including use of a spatula mundani. After the advent of the germ theory of disease then the idea of \\"auto-intoxication\\" entered popular Western thought in a fresh way. Enema as a scientific medical treatment and colon cleansing as alternative medical treatment became more common in medical practice. Since the 1700s in the West there has been some popular thought that people with constipation have some moral failing with gluttony or laziness. Special populations=Children= Approximately 3% of children have constipation, with girls and boys being equally affected. With constipation accounting for approximately 5% of general pediatrician visits and 25% of pediatric gastroenterologist visits, the symptom carries a significant financial impact upon the healthcare system. While it is difficult to assess an exact age at which constipation most commonly arises, children frequently suffer from constipation in conjunction with life-changes. Examples include: toilet training, starting or transferring to a new school, and changes in diet. Especially in infants, changes in formula or transitioning from breast milk to formula can cause constipation. The majority of constipation cases are not tied to a medical disease, and treatment can be focused on simply relieving the symptoms. =Postpartum women= The six-week period after pregnancy is called the postpartum stage. During this time, women are at increased risk of being constipated. Multiple studies estimate the prevalence of constipation to be around 25% during the first 3 months.Drossman DA, Corazziari E, Talley NJ, Grant Thompson W, Whitehead WE, editors. Rome II: the Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders. Diagnosis, Pathophysiology and Treatment: a Multinational Consensus. 2nd Edition. McLean: Degnon Associates, 2000 Constipation can cause discomfort for women, as they are still recovering from the delivery process especially if they have had a perineal tear or underwent an episiotomy. Risk factors that increase the risk of constipation in this population include: * Damage to the levator ani muscles (pelvic floor muscles) during childbirth * Forceps-assisted delivery * Lengthy second stage of labor * Delivering a large child * Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are common in pregnancy and also may get exacerbated when constipated. Anything that can cause pain with stooling (hemorrhoids, perineal tear, episiotomy) can lead to constipation because patients may withhold from having a bowel movement so as to avoid pain. The pelvic floor muscles play an important role in helping pass a bowel movement. Injury to those muscles by some of the above risk factors (examples- delivering a large child, lengthy second stage of labor, forceps delivery) can result in constipation. Enemas may be administered during labor and these can also alter bowel movements in the days after giving birth. However, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of laxatives in this group of people.

Although afraid at the time of its creation of cramming too many historical details into the story, Rosa himself mentions in Uncle Scrooge #383 (November, 2008) that in fan mail he receives to this day, Guardians of the Lost Library to his own surprise is often referred to as \\"'the best Rosa story' or 'the best Duck story' or even 'the best comic book story' (?!!) that fans say they've ever read.\\"Guardians of the Lost Library: Commentary by Don Rosa, from Uncle Scrooge, #383, November, 2008, pp. 31-33 In this story Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie, and General Snozzie search for the Lost Library of Alexandria. This story was Don Rosa's first use of General Snozzie, the Junior Woodchucks bloodhound. The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1993-42; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge Adventures #27, in July 1994.  Background  Rosa created Guardians of the Lost Library at the request of Scandinavia-based, European Disney publisher Egmont in reference to the fact that Norway had officially declared 1993 to be \\"The Year of The Book\\" in order to promote reading (as the story was published in Norway and Denmark in 1993, one year prior to its first edition in the original English). Rosa figured that he would honor the written word best by sending the Ducks on an epic quest for the Library of Alexandria, where he: :\\"could show the evolution of books from papyrus scrolls through parchment tomes and the first Gutenberg volumes on up to the present day. [...] In the process, it was easy to show how books have recorded and even inspired the advancements of science and art through the ages [...]. And what could be better than for the key to tracing the Library around the world be that most famous mythical book of all - the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook?!\\"  Plot  Donald Duck and his nephews go to the new Woodchuck Museum to see the exhibit on artifacts from the first Junior Woodchucks. The nephews are particularly enthusiastic about an old, worn, massive volume that is the oldest known copy of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook. Scrooge McDuck is also there to get a copy of the Guidebook, which he knows contains an enormous wealth of information. However, the scoutmaster refuses, on the regulation that McDuck is too old to join the organization, and only members are allowed to read its guidebook. Also the scoutmaster suspects, correctly, that Scrooge would use the information mainly to enrich himself, as he has recently done by acquiring the entire log books of the 16th century Spanish fleet to find lost treasures. Scrooge tells the nephews that he would like to find the Library of Alexandria for the same purpose. The head of The Junior Woodchucks organization agrees to sponsor Scrooge's trip in the name of science as well as lend out General Snozzie, the Woodchucks bloodhound. Scrooge and the nephews set out to find the lost library, leaving behind Donald totally oblivious to the events as he sits constantly glued to the TV, currently holding the occupation of Scrooge's Money Bin guard. They set out to Egypt, where they find an underground chamber with a million bronze tubes containing the original scrolls of the Library of Alexandria. Unfortunately, it turns out that the scrolls have long crumbled to dust. Cleopatra had however founded a special organization, \\"The Guardians of the Great Library\\", to protect the unique book collection. Still in operation centuries later, the Guardians had complete parchment copies made shortly before the burning of the library which were shipped to Byzantium, Greece around 400AD, to become known as the Library of Constantinople. In Istanbul, modern-day Turkey, these \\"100,000 parchment scrolls\\" (\\"perhaps they left out the plays and poetry\\") once were \\"the light of the Dark Ages for 800 years\\" and had \\"the books from the great libraries of Islam\\" added to them over time. However, the entire collection finally perished in a fire. Yet the contents survived, since for centuries the Orthodox monks had copied them into the modern technology of 10,000 manuscripts (with each hand-written book holding 10 original scrolls). This Byzantine Library of manuscripts was however stolen in 1204 in the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, crusader knights bringing the books to Venice. In Venice, these books were kept in an abbey whose library henceforth \\"sparked the Renaissance\\", inspired \\"Leonardo and Michelangelo\\", and motivated Marco Polo and his father to journey to the Orient, paying back the library by adding the Great Books from Kublai Khan's Empire of Cathay to it upon Marco's return. The Venice Library was lost in 1485 during the collapse of the abbey's bell tower, but following the invention of movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439, the rotting books had been saved in their entirety by making their first typeset copy \\"of about 1,000 volumes\\", with each typeset book containing 10 manuscripts. Inspired by Phoenician accounts dating 600BCE of rich new lands beyond the Western ocean in the books, Lorenzo de Medici sent a bookdealer named Cristobal Colon in 1484 to buy these 1,000 volumes, but Colon never turned the books over to the Medici family. When Scrooge and the nephews find out that the English name of this bookdealer-turned sailor happens to be Christopher Columbus and that Columbus's private library is in Seville, Spain, Scrooge is pacing out the door, \\"already halfway across France\\". In the Biblioteca Colombina, they are forced to decipher Columbus' private notes hand-written in a secret, unknown code by means of the Woodchuck Guidebook, to find out Columbus had the library moved to Santo Domingo in 1498, far from the reach of the Medici and the Spanish King, but Ferdinand II of Aragon soon found out and had Columbus put into chains. Scrooge and the nephews hurry back to Duckburg (where they encounter Donald still in front of the TV, making condescending remarks about their passion for \\"some dusty old library books\\") to search Scrooge's above-mentioned Spanish logs to find out whether the library had ever been removed from the island. Apparently, Francisco Pizarro had it moved to his new capital, modern-day Lima, Peru in 1535, where beginning in 1551, the scholars at San Marcos University added \\"all the knowledge of the Mayans, Aztecs, Incas, and Olmecs\\". When the Spanish tried to send the library home to Spain in 1579, the ships were captured by Sir Francis Drake. As the battle had damaged his own ship, Drake was forced to go ashore on the coast of Nova Albion, founding Fort Drake Borough which later became Duckburg, for the sole purpose of burying the library below the fort, on Killmotor Hill where Scrooge built his Money Bin in 1902 (see Fort Duckburg). Hurrying into old caves and bricked gangways Scrooge never explored before below the Bin, they find a large crypt full of old books. On closer inspection, only the covers are left, since the vellum pages turn out to have been eaten by rats. Scrooge is furious because the library seems to have perished once and for all. However, in the middle of the room stands a metal case, with the emblem of the Guardians of the Lost Library our heroes first saw in Egypt: an Ibis symbolizing Thoth, the Egyptian deity of wisdom and writing. An inscription on a metal plate by the last survivor of Drakeborough tells how he, on Drake's orders, had the library condensed into one single volume with every information no other surviving book in the world included. As the Lost Library's last guardian, he had this one book sealed into this rat-proof metal box. Scrooge is triumphant that the unique essence of the library seems to have survived after all, but upon opening the box he is deeply frustrated to find it empty. The nephews stitch the remaining puzzle together: the British didn't find the library when they reoccupied Drakeborough, but Cornelius Coot, the founder of the City of Duckburg, found it during the late 18th century, and left the book to his son Clinton Coot, the founder of the Junior Woodchucks. The very volume that was on display in the Woodchuck Museum at the beginning of the story, it was used as the framework for the Junior Woodchuck's Guidebook, the only one book in the world Scrooge cannot buy. This not only explains why the Guidebook facilitated them to follow the trail of the Lost Library all over the world with its enormous knowledge base, but also the fact the Junior Woodchuck's logo, based on the letters J and two Ws, looks uncannily like the inverted Ibis emblem of the Guardians of the Lost Library. Later on, Scrooge comments on how depressed he is about not getting the books he has traveled all over the globe for, until the boys remind him that he would have had to turn the library over to Alexandria. Scrooge gets excited about how much money he saved on the fine he would have had to pay otherwise for 100,000 library scrolls each overdue for 2,000 years, and Donald complains about the noise drowning out the TV, muttering \\"Cripes! They're still going on about their stupid library! As if messing with books was as interesting as watching TV! Hah! That'll be the day!\\"  Historical accuracy  The story contains at least one potential historical error: It apparently claims that Alexander the Great intended Alexandria to be the capital of his empire. Actually, he built it to be the capital of Egypt but not of the entire empire. Babylon was the capital of Alexander's empire, even though Alexandria became the capital of the diadochic Ptolemaic Kingdom under Alexander's immediate successor Ptolemy I Soter. The exact quote found in Guardians of the Lost Library, \\"The city was founded by Alexander the Great in the fourth century B. C. to be the capital of his empire!\\" is a bit ambiguous, meaning either that it was Alexander's direct personal intention or that it was about to happen independently of whatever Alexander had intended.  Disney and in-universe references = Disney reference = Scrooge makes a reference to Mickey Mouse not being published anymore. That was true during the time this story was first published but it was mainly used as an inside joke. = Duckburg genealogy = The names Fulton Gearloose and Clinton Coot were first used in this story but it was not revealed that they were the fathers of Gyro Gearloose and Grandma Duck, respectively. = Other stories by Don Rosa = Guardians of the Lost Library was later referenced in Part 10: The Invader of Fort Duckburg (1994), of Don Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck where in 1902 the first three Junior Woodchucks are expelled from their former headquarter, the ruins of Fort Duckburg recently bought by Scrooge. As the boyscouts walk down Killmotor Hill, along with some JWC pennants they carry a large, old volume with the Iris Emblem of the Guardians of the Lost Library with them. One of the Junior Woodchucks says \\"Someday we've just got to make pocket-size copies of this monster!\\" As the condensed book passed on by the last survivor of Drakeborough and found by Clinton Coot is the framework for the first edition of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, in Rosa's later story The Lost Charts of Columbus (1995), the Junior Woodchucks intend to raise funds for excavations at the site of Cleopatra's hidden library in Egypt before it was brought to Byzantium. So they organize a raffle and Gladstone Gander wins a fishing trip to Canada, where he recovers the Golden Helmet from Barks's eponymous story, allowing Azure Blue to resume his plans of owning North America. Above- mentioned ancient Phoenician accounts of the Americas having inspired Lorenzo de Medici and Christopher Columbus in Guardians of the Lost Library are revisited in this story as well.  Publication history  Cover to Uncle $crooge #383, November 2008, Guardians of the Lost Library. Original cover art by Don Rosa Guardians of the Lost Library was first published in Uncle Scrooge Adventures #27, July, 1994. Compared to European prints, this original English-language edition was of a poor quality where on a number of pages the CMYK printing plates had been misaligned resulting in more than obvious color fringing. The story was eventually re-published at a higher printing quality in Gemstone's 60 Years of Uncle $crooge celebratory edition Uncle Scrooge #383, November, 2008 (which turned out to be Gemstone's ultimate Disney comic publication, as Boom! Kids was about to take over publishing Disney's classic characters starting September, 2009). Again, original art by Rosa was used for the cover, however the artwork used for the 2008 reprint had been initially made by Rosa not specifically as cover art but as part of a series of collectibles related to his stories that had been originally published by French Disney magazine Picsou Magazine in 2004.INDUCKS information on the Don Rosa collectible artwork first published in Picsou Magazine #385, February 2004, and later used for the cover of Uncle $crooge #383 While the 2008 reprint featured a superior printing quality and the 2008 cover was shaded as usual with North American Disney comics, with the reprinted story itself Gemstone replaced Gladstone Publishing's 1994 finer-graded colorization featuring many soft gradients with Egmont's European solid-hue color scheme.

The screenplay by Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch was based on the 1980 novella by Max Schott. The film stars Sally Field, James Garner, Brian Kerwin, and Corey Haim, and was produced by Laura Ziskin for Field's production company Fogwood Films. The film's theme song, \\"Love for the Last Time,\\" is performed by Carole King. Plot summary Emma Moriarty (Sally Field) is a 33-year-old, divorced mother who moves to a rural Arizona town to make a living by training and boarding horses. She becomes friends with the town's pharmacist, Murphy Jones (James Garner), a widower. But a romance between them seems unlikely due to Murphy's age and because Emma allows her ex-husband, Bobby Jack Moriarty (Brian Kerwin), to move back in with her and their 12-year-old son, Jake (Corey Haim). Emma struggles to make ends meet, but is helped by Murphy, an idiosyncratic widower. While refusing to help her outright with charity or personal loan, Murphy buys a horse with her assistance and pays to board it with Emma, while encouraging others to do the same. He also provides emotional support for Emma and Jake. A rivalry develops between Murphy and Bobby Jack. This competition continues until Bobby Jack's newest girlfriend appears with their newborn twin sons. At the end Murphy and Emma choose to pursue a relationship.

Columbia did not want to make the picture at all, because it had no \\"sex or violence\\" in it. But because of the success of Norma Rae (1979), with the same star (Field), director, and screenwriting team (Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch), and with Field's new production company Fogwood Films producing, Columbia agreed.

They did begin a limited, selected, release for the film on December 25, 1985, so that it would qualify for that year's Academy Awards. The film was one of the final titles to be released on the now defunct CED Videodisc format in 1986. Reception Reviews were generally favorable. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars (out of 4), stating \\"Much depends on exactly what Emma and Murphy say to each other, and how they say it, and what they don't say.

Murphy marries someone else, and then tries to find Emma a suitable husband.

Remembered for his rapid rise to fame, Hammer is known for hit records (such as \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\"), flashy dance movements, choreography and eponymous Hammer pants. A multi-award winner, M.C. Hammer is considered a \\"forefather/pioneer\\" and innovator of pop-rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music) and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album. BET ranked Hammer as the No. 7 \\"Best Dancer Of All Time\\". Vibes \\"The Best Rapper Ever Tournament\\" declared him the 17th favorite of all-time during the first round. Hammer's popularity and success waned beginning in the mid-nineties when he was labeled a sellout by the changing landscape of hip-hop music, leading to financial problems later in life, including bankruptcy in 1996. Burrell became a preacher during the late 1990s with a Christian ministry program on TBN called M.C. Hammer and Friends. Additionally, he starred in a Saturday-morning cartoon called Hammerman in 1991 and was executive producer of his own reality show called Hammertime, which aired on the A&E; Network during the summer of 2009. Hammer was also a television show host and dance judge on Dance Fever in 2003, was co-creator of a dance website called DanceJam.com and is a record label CEO while still performing concerts at music venues and assisting with other social media, ministry and outreach functions. Prior to becoming ordained, Hammer signed with Suge Knight's Death Row Records in 1995. Throughout his career, Hammer has managed his own recording business. As a result, he has created and produced his own acts including Ho Frat Hoo!, Oaktown's 3.5.7, Special Generation, Analise, DRS, B Angie B and Gentry Kozia. A part of additional record labels, he has associated, collaborated and recorded with Psy, VMF, Tupac Shakur, Teddy Riley, Felton Pilate, Tha Dogg Pound, The Whole 9, The Hines Brother, Deion Sanders, Big Daddy Kane, BeBe & CeCe Winans and Jon Gibson. Early life and education Stanley Kirk Burrell was born on March 30, 1962 in Oakland, California. His father was a professional poker player and gambling casino manager (at Oaks Card Club's cardroom), as well as warehouse supervisor. He grew up poor with his mother (a secretary) and eight siblings in a small apartment in East Oakland. He recalled that six children were crammed into a three-bedroom housing project apartment. The Burrells would also frequent thoroughbred horse races, eventually becoming owners and winners of several graded stakes. In the Oakland Coliseum parking lot the young Burrell would sell stray baseballs and dance accompanied by a beatboxer. Oakland A's team owner Charles O. Finley saw the 11-year-old doing splits and hired him as a clubhouse assistant and batboy as a result of his energy and flair. Burrell served as a \\"batboy\\" with the team from 1973 to 1980. In 2010, Hammer discussed his lifelong involvement with athletes on ESPN's First Take as well as explained that his brother Louis Burrell Jr. (who would later become Hammer's business manager) was actually the batboy while his job was to take calls and do \\"play-by-plays\\" for the A's absentee owner during every summer game. The colorful Finley, who lived in Chicago, used the child as his \\"eyes and ears.\\" Reggie Jackson, in describing Burrell's role for Finley, took credit for his nickname: Team players, including Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Pedro Garcia, also dubbed Burrell \\"Little Hammer\\" due to his resemblance to Aaron. Ron Bergman, at the time an Oakland Tribune writer who covered the A's, recalled that: According to Hammer: He acquired the nickname \\"M.C.\\" for being a \\"Master of Ceremonies\\" which he used when he began performing at various clubs while on the road with the A's, and eventually in the military. Hammer, who played second base in high school, dreamed of being a professional baseball player but did not make the final cut at a San Francisco Giants tryout. However, he has been a participant/player in the annual Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game wearing an A's cap to represent Oakland (American League). Burrell went on to graduate from McClymonds High School in Oakland in 1980 and took undergraduate classes in communications. Discouraged by his studies at a local college and failing to win a place in a professional baseball organization, he joined the United States Navy for three years, serving with PATRON (Patrol Squadron) FOUR SEVEN (VP-47) of NAS Moffett Field in Mountain View, CA as a Petty Officer Third Class Aviation Store Keeper (AK3) until his honorable discharge. Music and entertainment career Before Hammer's successful music career (with his mainstream popularity lasting approximately between 1988 and 1998) and his \\"rags-to-riches-to-rags-and-back saga\\", Burrell formed a Christian rap music group with CCM's Jon Gibson (or \\"J.G.\\") called Holy Ghost Boys. Some songs produced were called \\"Word\\" and \\"B-Boy Chill\\". \\"The Wall\\", featuring Burrell (it was originally within the lyrics of this song he first identified himself as K.B. and then eventually M.C. Hammer once it was produced), was later released on Gibson's album Change of Heart (1988). This was Contemporary Christian music's first rap hit ever. Burrell also produced \\"Son of the King\\" at that time, releasing it on his debut album. \\"Son of the King\\" showed up on Hammer's debut album Feel My Power (1987), as well as the re-released version Let's Get It Started (1988). With exception to later remixes of early releases, Hammer produced and recorded many rap songs that were never made public, yet are now available on the Internet. Via his record labels such as Bust It Records, Oaktown Records and Full Blast, Hammer has introduced, signed and produced new talent including Oaktown's 3.5.7, Ho Frat Hoo!, the vocal quintet Special Generation, Analise, James Greer, One Cause One Effect, B Angie B, The Stooge Playaz, DASIT (as seen on ego trip's The (White) Rapper Show), Teabag, Common Unity, Geeman and Pleasure Ellis; both collaborating with him and producing music of their own during his career. At about the age of 12, Oakland native Keyshia Cole recorded with Hammer and sought career advice from him. =Feel My Power (1986)= In the mid-1980s while rapping in small venues and after a record deal went sour, Hammer borrowed US$20,000 each from former Oakland A's players Mike Davis and Dwayne Murphy to start a record label business called Bust It Productions. He kept the company going by selling records from his basement and car. Bust It spawned Bustin' Records, the independent label of which Hammer was CEO. Together, the companies had more than 100 employees. Recording singles and selling them out of the trunk of his car, he marketed himself relentlessly. Coupled with his dance abilities, Hammer's style was unique at the time. Now billing himself as \\"M.C. Hammer\\", he recorded his debut album, Feel My Power, which was produced between 1986 and 1987 and released independently in 1987 on his Oaktown Records label (Bustin').[ ] It was produced by Felton Pilate (of Con Funk Shun). It sold over 60,000 copies and was distributed by City Hall Records. In the spring of 1988, Tony Valera, a 107.7 KSOL Radio DJ, played the track \\"Let's Get It Started\\" in his mix-shows‚Äîa song in which Hammer declared he was \\"second to none, from Doug E. Fresh, LL Cool J, or DJ Run\\"‚Äîafter which the track began to gain popularity in clubs. (He would continue to call out other East Coast rappers in future projects as well.) Hammer also released a single called \\"Ring 'Em\\", and largely on the strength of tireless street marketing by Hammer and his wife, plus continued radio mix-show play, it achieved considerable popularity at dance clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Heartened by his rising prospects, Hammer launched into seven-day-a-week rehearsals with the growing troupe of dancers, musicians, and backup vocalists he had hired. It was Hammer's stage show, and his infectious stage presence, that led to his big break in 1988 while performing in an Oakland club. There he impressed a record executive who \\"didn't know who he was, but knew he was somebody\\", according to the New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll. Though Hammer had previously received and declined offers from major record labels before, he agreed to a multi-album contract with Capitol with a $1,750,000 advance. It didn't take long for Capitol to recoup its investment. =Let's Get It Started (1988)= Once signed to Capitol Records, Hammer re- issued his first record (a revised version of Feel My Power) with additional tracks added and sold over 2 million copies. \\"Pump It Up\\" (also performed during Showtime at the Apollo on September 16, 1989), \\"Turn This Mutha Out\\", \\"Let's Get It Started\\" and \\"They Put Me in the Mix\\" were the most popular singles from this album, all of which charted. Not entirely satisfied with this first multi-platinum success, Hammer's music underwent a metamorphosis, shifting from the standard rap format. \\"I decided the next album would be more musical,\\" he said at the time. Purists chastised him for being more dancer than rapper. Sitting in a leopard-print bodysuit before a concert, he defended his style: \\"People were ready for something different from the traditional rap style. The fact that the record has reached this level indicates the genre is growing.\\" M.C. Hammer was very good friends with Arsenio Hall (as well as a then-unknown teen named Robert Van Winkle, aka Vanilla Ice, despite later rumors that there was a \\"beef\\" between the two rappers which was addressed during the height of both their careers on Hall's show, and who he would later reunite with in a 2009 concert in Salt Lake City, Utah), and as such, Hammer was first invited to perform the song \\"U Can't Touch This\\", prior to its release, on The Arsenio Hall Show in 1989. He also performed \\"Dancing Machine\\" in a version that appeared in the same-titled movie. Hammer used some of the proceeds from this album to install a rolling recording studio in the back of his tour bus, where he recorded much of his second album. In 1989, Hammer was featured on \\"You've Got Me Dancing\\" (with Glen Goldsmith), which appeared on the Glen Goldsmith album Don't Turn This Groove Around (RCA Records). The track was Hammer's first release in the UK. Hammer also appeared in Glen Goldsmith's music video for this song. The single failed to chart. =Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em (1990)= Notorious for dissing rappers in his previous recordings, Hammer appropriately titled his third album (and second major- label release) Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em, which was released February 12, 1990 (with an original release date of January 1, 1990). It included the successful single \\"U Can't Touch This\\" (which sampled Rick James' \\"Super Freak\\"). It was produced, recorded, and mixed by Felton Pilate and James Earley on a modified tour bus while on tour in 1989. Despite heavy airplay and a No. 27 chart debut, \\"U Can't Touch This\\" stopped at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart because it was released only as a twelve-inch single. However, the album was a No. 1 success for 21 weeks, due primarily to this single, the first time ever for a recording on the pop charts. The song has been and continues to be used in many filmmaking and television shows to date, and appears on soundtrack/compilation albums as well. Follow-up successes included a cover of the Chi-Lites' \\"Have You Seen Her\\" and \\"Pray\\" (a beat sampled from Prince's \\"When Doves Cry\\" and Faith No More's \\"We Care a Lot\\"),ead which was his biggest hit in the US, peaking at No. 2. \\"Pray\\" was also a major UK success, peaking at No. 8. The album went on to become the first hip-hop album to earn diamond status, selling more than 18 million units to date. During 1990, Hammer toured extensively in Europe which included a sold-out concert at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. With the sponsorship of PepsiCo International, Pepsi CEO Christopher A. Sinclair went on tour with him during 1991. The album was notable for sampling other high-profile artists and gave some of these artists a new fanbase. \\"Dancin' Machine\\" sampled The Jackson 5, \\"Help the Children\\" (also the name of an outreach foundation Hammer started) interpolates Marvin Gaye's \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\", and \\"She's Soft and Wet\\" also sampled Prince's \\"Soft and Wet\\". All of these songs proved to be successful on radio and video television, with \\"U Can't Touch This,\\" \\"Pray\\" (most successful), \\"Have You Seen Her,\\" \\"Here Comes the Hammer,\\" and \\"Yo!! Sweetness\\" (UK only) all charting. The album increased the popularity of hip- hop music. It remains the genre's all-time best-selling album. A movie also accompanied the album and was produced in 1990, called Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie (with portions of his music videos included within the movie). At the same time, he also appeared in The West Coast Rap All-Stars posse cut \\"We're All in the Same Gang.\\" Music videos from this album and the previous albums began to receive much airplay on MTV and VH1. M.C. Hammer also contributed a track, \\"This is What We Do\\", on the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie soundtrack on SBK Records. A critical backlash began over the repetitive nature of his lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over- reliance on sampling others' entire hooks for the basis of his singles‚Äîcriticisms also directed to his contemporary, Vanilla Ice. He was mocked in music videos by 3rd Bass (including a rap battle with MC Serch), The D.O.C., DJ Debranz, and Ice Cube. Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their Sex Packets album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q Tip criticized him in \\"Check the Rhyme,\\" asking, \\"What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop.\\" LL Cool J dissed him in \\"To tha Break of Dawn\\" (from the Mama Said Knock You Out album), calling Hammer an \\"amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag [his pants],\\" and saying, \\"My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.\\", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in \\"Let's Get it Started\\", when he was mentioned along with Run-DMC and Doug E. Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: \\"A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous.\\" Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records. Despite the criticisms, Hammer's career continued to be highly successful including tours in Asia, Europe, Australia, and Russia. Soon after, M.C. Hammer Mattel dolls, lunchboxes, and other merchandise were marketed. He was also given his own Saturday morning cartoon, called Hammerman, which he hosted and voiced.MC Hammer To Perform At Reds Game SB-Nation =Too Legit to Quit (1991)= After publicly dropping the \\"M.C.\\" from his stage name, Hammer released Too Legit to Quit (also produced by Felton Pilate) in 1991. Hammer answered his critics within certain songs from the album. Sales were strong (over five million copies), with the title track being the biggest hit single from this record. The album peaked in the Top 5 of the Billboard 200. Another hit came soon after, with \\"Addams Groove\\" (which appeared on both The Addams Family motion picture soundtrack and the vinyl and cassette versions of 2 Legit 2 Quit), reaching No. 7 in the U.S. and No. 4 in the UK. His video for the song appeared after the movie. Hammer set out on a high-profile tour promoting the album which included a stage show ‚Å†loaded with singers, dancers, and backup musicians. In 1992, Boyz II Men joined the tour as an opening act. While traveling the country, their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in Chicago, and the group's future performances of \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\" were dedicated to him. As a result of this unfortunate experience, the song would help advance their success. Ultimately, however, the lavish show proved too expensive to support through album sales and it was cancelled partway through its scheduled run. Music videos were produced for all four singles released from this album (including \\"Do Not Pass Me By\\" and \\"This Is The Way We Roll\\"), all which charted. The \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" video featured many celebrity appearances. It's been ranked as one of the most expensive videos ever made. The hand motions used within the song and video also became very popular. The song proved to be successful in the U.S., peaking in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, at #5. Despite the album's multi-platinum certification, the sales were one-third of Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em. At the end of the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" video, after James Brown enlists Hammer to get the famous glove of Michael Jackson, a silver-white sequined glove is shown on the hand of a Michael Jackson look-alike doing the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" hand gesture. In a related story, M.C. Hammer appeared on The Wendy Williams Show (July 27, 2009) and talked about his hit reality show Hammertime on A&E;, his marriage, his role as a dad and the reasons he eventually went bankrupt. He told an amusing story about a phone call he received from \\"M.J.\\", regarding the portion of the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" video that included a fake Michael Jackson, giving his approval and inclusion of it. He explained how Michael had seen the video and liked it, and both expressed they were fans of one another. Hammer and Jackson would later appear, speak and/or perform at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006. The artwork featured in the album was created by James B. Young and accompanying studios. During 1991, Hammer was featured on the single \\"The Blood\\" from the BeBe & CeCe Winans album, Different Lifestyles. In 1992, the song peaked at No. 8 on the Christian charts. =New venture with Oaktown/Giant Records (1992‚Äì1993)= In 1992, after a four-year hiatus, Doug E. Fresh signed with Hammer's label, Bust It Records and issued one album, Doin' What I Gotta Do, which (despite some minor acclaim for his single \\"Bustin' Out (On Funk)\\" which sampled the Rick James 1979 single \\"Bustin' Out\\") was a commercial failure. Prior to Hammer's next album, The Funky Headhunter, rumors from critics and fans began claiming Hammer had quit the music/entertainment business or had suffered a financial downfall (since a couple of years were passing between his two records), which Hammer denied. Hammer claimed rumors falsely heralded his downfall were most likely a result of the fact he turned over his \\"trimmed-down\\" Bust It Records to his brother and manager Louis Burrell Jr., and his horse racing interests to his brother Chris and their father, Louis Burrell Sr. During his hiatus between albums, Hammer consequently signed a multimillion-dollar deal with a new record company. He said there were a lot of bidders, but \\"not too many of them could afford Hammer\\". Therefore, Hammer parted ways with Felton Pilate (who had previously worked with the successful vocal group Con Funk Shun) and switched record labels to Giant Records, taking his Oaktown label with him. Hammer was eventually sued by Pilate. Additionally, Hammer launched a new enterprise, called Roll Wit It Entertainment & Sports Management, with clients such as Evander Holyfield, Deion Sanders and Reggie Brooks. In 1993, his production company released a hit rap song by DRS. By this time, he also parted ways with his only female executive, music business administration consultant and songwriter, Linda Lou McCall (who previously worked with The Delfonics and her husband Louis A. McCall, Sr.'s band Con Funk Shun). She went on to work with artists such as Puff Daddy, Faith Evans, Notorious B.I.G., M√Ωa, Black Eyed Peas and Eminem. A music industry vet who attended Howard University's College of Fine Arts and the University of California-Davis School of Law, McCall was hired by Hammer's brother and manager, Louis K. Burrell, in 1990 to help set up his corporate operations and administration at Bust It Management and Productions Inc. in Oakland, California. She later became Vice President of Hammer's talent management company, overseeing artists like Heavy D, B Angie B and Ralph Tresvant. While at Bust It, she and her husband Louis A. McCall, Sr. brought their artist Keith Martin to Felton's attention who hired him as a backup musician and vocalist for Hammer's Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em and Too Legit to Quit world tours. In 1993 and 1994, Linda Lou was also involved in several lawsuits against Hammer which were eventually settled out of court. With a new home and daughter, a new record soon to be released, and his new business, Hammer claimed he was happy and far from being broke during a tour of his mansion for Ebony. \\"Today there is a more aggressive Hammer, because the '90s require you to be more aggressive\\", Hammer said of his music style. \\"There is a harder edge, but I'm no gang member. Hammer in the '90s is on the offense, on the move, on the attack. And it's all good\\". =The Funky Headhunter and Prime Time (1994)= In 1993, Hammer began recording his fifth official album. To adapt to the changing landscape of hip-hop, this album was a more aggressive sounding album entitled The Funky Headhunter. He co-produced this record with funky rapper and producer, Stefan Adamek. While Hammer's appearance changed to keep up with the gangsta rap audience, his lyrics still remained honest and somewhat clean with minor profanity. Yet, as with previous records, Hammer would continue to call out and disrespect other rappers on this album. As with some earlier songs such as \\"Crime Story\\" (from the album Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em), the content and reality about \\"street life\\" remained somewhat the same, but the sound was different, resulting in Hammer losing favor with fans. This album peaked at number two on the R&B; charts and remained in the Top 30 midway through the year. The album was eventually certified platinum. Hammer debuted the video for \\"Pumps and a Bump\\" during another appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show during the mid-1990s. Host Arsenio Hall said to M.C. Hammer, \\"Women in the audience want to know, what's in your speedos in the 'Pumps and a Bump' video?\\" A clip from the video was then shown, to much approval from the audience. Hammer didn't give a direct answer, but instead laughed. Arsenio then said, \\"I guess that's why they call you 'Hammer.' It ain't got nothin' to do with Hank Aaron.\\" The video to the album's first single, \\"Pumps and a Bump\\", was banned from heavy rotation on MTV with censors claiming that the depiction of Hammer in Speedos (and with what appeared to be an erection) was too graphic. This led to an alternative video being filmed (with Hammer fully clothed) that was directed by Bay Area native Craig S. Brooks. \\"It's All Good\\" was the second single released and was the most successful song by this title. Within this album, Hammer disses rappers such as A Tribe Called Quest (Q-Tip), Redman and Run DMC for previous attacks they made against him on wax. This quite possibly led to a decrease in his popularity after this record responded to his critics. On December 20, 1994, Deion Sanders released Prime Time, a rap album on Hammer's Bust It Records label which featured the minor hit \\"Must Be The Money\\". \\"Prime Time Keeps on Tickin'\\" was also released as a single. Sanders, a friend of Hammer's, had previously appeared in his \\"Too Legit to Quit\\" music video, and his alter-ego \\"Prime Time\\" is also used in Hammer's \\"Pumps and a Bump\\" video. The song \\"Help Lord (Won't You Come)\\" appeared in Kingdom Come. =Inside Out, Death Row Records and Too Tight (1995‚Äì1996)= In 1995, Hammer released the album Inside Out V (or inside out V). The album sold poorly compared to previous records (peaking at 119 on the Billboard Charts) and Giant Records dropped him and Oaktown Records from their roster. Songs \\"Going Up Yonder\\" and \\"Sultry Funk\\" managed to get moderate radio play (even charting on national radio station countdowns). Along with a fickle public, Hammer would go on to explain in this album that he felt many of his so-called friends he helped staff, used and betrayed him which contributed to a majority of his financial loss (best explained in the song \\"Keep On\\" and the bio from this album). He would also hint about this again in interviews, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2009. In 1995, Hammer released \\"Straight to My Feet\\" (with Deion Sanders) from the Street Fighter soundtrack (released in December 1994). The song charted No. 57 in the UK. Hammer's relationship with Suge Knight dates back to 1988. Hammer signed with Death Row Records by 1995, then home to Snoop Dogg and his close friend, Tupac Shakur. The label did not release the album of Hammer's music (titled Too Tight) while he had a career with them, although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album. However, Burrell did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song \\"Too Late Playa\\" (along with Big Daddy Kane and Danny Boy). After the death of Shakur in 1996, Burrell left the record company. He later explained his concern about this circumstance in an interview on Trinity Broadcasting Network since he was in Las Vegas with Tupac the night of his death. =Return to EMI and Family Affair (1996‚Äì1998)= MC Hammer at Larry King's charity event, 1999 In October 1996, Burrell and Oaktown signed with EMI, which saw the release of a compilation album of Hammer's chart topping songs prior to The Funky Headhunter. The album, titled Greatest Hits, featured 12 former hits. In 1998, another \\"greatest hits\\" album, called Back 2 Back Hits, was produced and released by CEMA. (Another compilation version of Back 2 Back was later released by Capitol Records in 2006.) As Hammer's empire began to collapse when his last album failed to match the sales of its predecessors, and since he unsuccessfully attempted to recast himself in the \\"streetwise/hardcore rap\\" mold of the day, Hammer turned to a gospel-friendly audience. In 1998, MC Hammer released his first album in his new deal with EMI, titled Family Affair, because it was to introduce the world to the artists he had signed to his Oaktown Records (Geeman, Teabag, and Common Unity) as they made their recording debut. Technically his seventh album since his debut EP, this record was highly promoted on Trinity Broadcasting Network (performing a more gospel version of \\"Keep On\\" from his album Inside Out V), yet featured no charting singles and selling about 1,000 copies worldwide. The album also features a song written for Hammer by 2Pac called \\"Unconditional Love\\". Hammer would later dance and read the lyrics to this song on the first VH1 Hip Hop Honors in 2004. A double album mostly about faith and family values, additional tracks from Family Affair are: \\"Put It Down\\", \\"Put Some Stop in Your Game\\", \\"Big Man\\", \\"Set Me Free\\", \\"Our God\\", \\"Responsible Father Shout\\", \\"He Brought Me Out\\", (Geeman Intro), \\"Eye's Like Mine\\", \\"Never Without You\\", \\"Praise Dance Theme Song\\", \\"Shame of the Name\\", (Smoothout Intro), (Teabag Intro), \\"Silly Heart\\", \\"I Wish U Were Free\\", (Common Unity Intro), \\"Someone to Hold to You\\", \\"Pray\\" (1998), \\"Let's Get It Started\\" (1998), and with \\"Hammer Music/Shouts/Tour Info\\" announcements between songs. The compact disks are also \\"PC Ready\\" with interactive features. After this album, new projects were rumored to be in the works, including an album (War Chest: Turn of the Century) and a soundtrack to the film Return to Glory: The Powerful Stirring of the Black Man, but neither appeared. =The Hits and Active Duty (2000‚Äì2001)= In 2000, another compilation album was released, titled The Hits. It contains 17 tracks from his first four albums. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, M.C. Hammer released his 8th studio album, Active Duty, on his own World Hit Music Group label (the musical enterprise under his Hammertime Holdings Inc. umbrella) to pay homage to the ones lost in the terrorist attacks. The album followed that theme, and featured two singles (with accompanying videos), \\"No Stoppin' Us (USA)\\" and \\"Pop Yo Collar\\" (featuring Wee Wee) which demonstrates \\"The Phat Daddy Pop\\", \\"In Pop Nito\\", \\"River Pop\\", \\"Deliver The Pop\\" and \\"Pop'n It Up\\" dance moves. The album, like its predecessor, failed to chart and would not sell as many copies as previous projects. Hammer did however promote it on such shows as The View and produced a video for both singles. This patriotic album, originally planned to be titled The Autobiography Of M.C. Hammer, donated portions of the proceeds to 9/11 charities. Hammer shot a video for the anthem \\"No Stoppin' Us (USA)\\" in Washington, D.C., with several members of the United States Congress, who sang in the song and danced in the video. Present members of the United States House of Representatives included J. C. Watts, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Thomas M. Davis, Earl Hilliard, Alcee Hastings, Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.), Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) and Jesse Jackson, Jr. =Full Blast (2004)= After leaving Capitol Records and EMI for the second time in his career, M.C. Hammer decided to move his Oaktown imprint to an independent distributor and released his ninth studio album, Full Blast (which was completed in late 2003 and released as a complete album in early 2004). The album would feature no charting singles and was not certified by the RIAA. A video was produced for \\"Full Blast\\", a song that attacks Eminem and Busta Rhymes for previous disrespect towards him. Some of the original songs didn't end up making the final album release. Guest artists included The Stooge Playaz, Pleasure, Rain, JD Greer and DasIt. =Look Look Look and Platinum MC Hammer (2006‚Äì2008)= After going independent, Hammer decided to create a digital label to release his tenth studio album, Look Look Look. The album was released in February 2006 and featured production from Scott Storch. The album featured the title- track single (Look Look Look) and a music video. It would sell much better than his previous release (300,000 copies worldwide). \\"YAY\\" was produced by Lil Jon. \\"What Happened to Our Hood?\\" (featuring Sam Logan) was originally from Active Duty. \\"I Got It From The Town\\" was used in the movie but is only present in one scene instead of the originally planned two on The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (soundtrack). Between 2006 and 2007, Hammer released a military-inspired rap song with a political message to President George W. Bush about sending American troops back home from war, called \\"Bring Our Brothers Home\\". The video was filmed at the Santa Monica Pier. In 2008, Platinum MC Hammer was released by EMI Records. The compilation consists of 12 tracks from Hammer's previous albums, with a similar playlist as former \\"greatest hits\\" records (with the exception of including a remix of \\"Hammer Hammer, They Put Me In A Mix\\" which includes rap lyrics that \\"They Put Me In A Mix\\" originally did not). An import was released by Capitol Records. =DanceJamtheMusic (2008‚Äì2009)= Since his 2006 album, Hammer continued to produce music and released several other raps that appeared on his social websites (such as Myspace and Dancejam.com) or in commercials, with another album announced to be launched in late 2008 (via his own record label Fullblast Playhouse). Talks of the tour and a new album were expected in 2009. \\"Getting Back to Hetton\\" was made public in 2008 as a digital single. It was a departure for Hammer, bringing in funky deep soul and mixing it with a more house style. Released through licence on Whippet Digital Recordings, media reviews were said to be \\"disappointing\\". However, the song \\"I Got Gigs\\" from this album was used in a 2009 ESPN commercial and performed during Hammertime (as well as played while he danced just prior to introducing Soulja Boy during YouTube Live on November 22, 2008). Other tracks and videos from the album included: \\"I Go\\" (produced by Lil Jon), \\"Keep It In Vegas\\", \\"Lookin' Out The Window\\", \\"Dem Jeans\\" (by DASIT), \\"Stooge Karma Sutra\\" (by The Stooge Playaz) and \\"Tried to Luv U\\" (by DASIT featuring Pleasure Ellis). MC Hammer performing with Vanilla Ice in July 2009. In March 2009, M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice had a one-off concert at the McKay Events Center in Orem, Utah. This concert aided in the promotion of Hammer's new music and television show. During the concert (as shown during an episode of Hammertime), it was mentioned between the two rappers that this was their first headline show together in nearly 20 years, since the time when they were touring together at the peak of their hip-hop careers. Hammer said: \\"Contrary to popular belief, Ice and I are not only cool with each other, we are like long lost friends. I've known him since he was 16, before he had a record contract and before I had a record contract. It is a great reunion.\\" Vanilla Ice said: \\"It's like no time has passed at all. We set the world on fire back in the day ... I'm so happy right now, the magic is here.\\" =Most recent releases (2010‚Äìpresent)= Hammer has occasionally released singles over the past few years. Below are the most publicized: \\"Better Run Run\\" (2010) M.C. Hammer promised to release a track (expected on October 31, 2010) responding to a song by Kanye West featuring Jay-Z which attacked him. On the \\"So Appalled\\" track, which features Swizz Beatz and RZA, Jay-Z raps a verse targeting Hammer about his financial dilemma in the 1990s. On it Jay says: 'Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused / I lost 30 mil' so I spent another 30 / 'Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me'. Hammer addressed his displeasure about the diss on Twitter, claiming he will react to Jay-Z on Halloween. Hammer released a sample of his \\"beef\\" with Jay-Z (aka 'Hell Boy' according to Hammer) in a brief teaser trailer called \\"Better Run Run\\" by 'King Hammer'. At one point, it was uncertain if his reaction would be a film video, a music video or a combination of both. Regardless, he claimed he would show evidence that 'Jigga worships the devil'. It's possible that Jay-Z was offended by an analogy Hammer was conveying in an earlier interview in response to \\"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\\" on AllHipHop. On November 1, Hammer's song with video called \\"Better Run Run!\\" hit the web in retaliation to Jay-Z's September 2010 diss towards him. M.C. accuses Jigga of being in league (and in the studio) with Satan‚Äîand then Hammer defeats the devil and forces Jay to be baptized. Speaking on the video, Jacob O'Gara of Ethos Magazine wrote: \\"What's more likely is that this feud is the last chapter in the tragic cautionary tale of M.C. Hammer, a tale that serves as a warning to all present and future kings of hip-hop. Keep your balance on the pedestal and wear the crown strong or you'll have the Devil to pay.\\" In an interview with BBC's DJ Semtex, Jay said he didn't mean the verses as a personal attack. \\"I didn't know that [Hammer's financial status] wasn't on the table for discussion!\\" he said. \\"I didn't know I was the first person ever to say that...\\" He continued, \\"When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way ‚Äî it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [Decoded] ‚Äî that wasn't a cheap plug,\\" he laughed. \\"He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong!\\" \\"See Her Face\\" (2011) On February 3, 2011, M.C. Hammer appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show premiering the track \\"See Her Face\\" via Flipboard. It was the first time Flipboard included music in the application. \\"Raider Nation\\" and \\"All In My Mind\\" (2013‚Äì2014) Among other singles, Hammer released \\"Raider Nation (Oakland Raiders Anthem)\\" along with a video in late 2013 and \\"All In My Mind\\" (which samples \\"Summer Breeze\\" by The Isley Brothers) in early 2014 with his newly formed group called Oakland Fight Club featuring Mistah F.A.B. \\"Help the Children\\" (2017) Hammer released an updated version of his 1990 charting song with a short film video in late 2017. Additional business ventures In 1991, M.C. Hammer established Oaktown Stable that would eventually have nineteen Thoroughbred racehorses. That year, his outstanding filly Lite Light won several Grade I stakes races including the prestigious Kentucky Oaks. His D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt Dance Floor won the Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes and the Breeders' Futurity Stakes in 1991, then the following year won the Fountain of Youth Stakes and finished 3rd in the 1992 Kentucky Derby. He continues to attend shows as well as many sporting events alongside celebrities. In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, along with a new clothing line called \\"J Slick\\", Hammer began creating and working on M.C. Hammer USA, an interactive online portal. In 2002, Hammer signed a book contract with publishing company Simon & Schuster which called for a release the following year. However, a manuscript for an inspirational book called Enemies of the Father: Messages from the Heart on Being a Family Man (addressing the situation of African American men), for which Hammer received advance money to write, was never submitted in 2003. This resulted in Hammer being sued by the book company over claims that he never finished the book as promised. The company's March 2009 lawsuit sought return of the US$61,000 advance given to Hammer for the unwritten book about fatherhood. Hammer was a popular web mogul and activist, becoming involved in several Internet projects (including TechCrunch40 conferences). In 2007, Hammer was co-founder and chief strategy officer of Menlo Park-based (Silicon Valley) DanceJam.com along with Geoffrey Arone. The community site (valued at $4.5 million) was exclusively dedicated to dancing video competitions, techniques and styles which Hammer sometimes judged or rated. After receiving $4.5 million in total equity funding, the site closed on January 1, 2011. In July 2010, Hammer started a mixed martial arts management company to manage, market, promote, and brand-build for fighters such as Nate Marquardt, Tim F. Kennedy, and Vladimir Matyushenko, among others. According to MMAWeekly.com and Bizjournals, his new company is Alchemist Management in Los Angeles. It now manages 10 fighters. That same month, Hammer also announced his latest venture called Alchemist Clothing. The brand described as a colorful new lifestyle clothing line debuted during an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight in Austin. Middleweight fighter Nate \\"The Great\\" Marquardt wore an Alchemist shirt as he walked out to the ring. Hammer has shown an interest in boxing throughout his career. On September 28, 2010, M.C. Hammer headlined at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference for an official after-hours party.MC Hammer Rocks A Perfect Day At TechCrunch Disrupt techcrunch.com Hammer appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in February 2011 to discuss his tech-media-mogul status, as well as his creation, demonstration and consulting of social applications/sites/media (such as having an involvement with the Internet since 1994 including YouTube and Twitter), and devices such as iPad and ZAGGmate. He also explained how employing/helping so many people in the past never really caused him to be broke in terms of the average person, as the media made it seem, nor would he have changed any experiences that has led him to where he is today. During the \\"Whatever Happened to M.C. Hammer\\" episode, he discussed his current home, family and work life as well. In October 2011, Hammer announced a new internet venture called WireDoo - a \\"deep search engine\\" that planned to compete with the major search engines including Google and Bing. With the motto, \\"Search once and see what's related\\", Hammer's team planned to eventually open up the site to a select number of beta testers. Wiredoo failed, having never left beta testing, and officially went offline in early 2012. =Television and film career= MC Hammer in 2008 M.C. Hammer produced and starred in his own movie, Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie (1990). The film is about a rapper returning to his hometown who defeats a drug lord using kids to traffic his product. For this project, Hammer earned a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 33rd Grammy Awards (having been nominated for two). He later produced MC Hammer: 2 Legit (The Videos), which included many actors and athletes. Hammer appeared in major marketing campaigns for companies such as Pepsi, KFC, Toshiba, British Knights and Taco Bell during the height of his career. In 1991, Hammer hosted, sang/rapped and voiced a Saturday-morning cartoon called Hammerman. That same year, he and Bust It Productions (including B Angie B, Special Generation and Ho Frat Hoo!) appeared in concert from New Orleans on BET Hammer has made cameos and/or performed on many television shows such as Saturday Night Live (as host and musical guest), Amen and Martin. He also made a cameo in the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Last Action Hero. Hammer would also go on to appear as himself on The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Vol. 5 (1995). Additionally, he has been involved in movies as an actor such as, One Tough Bastard (1996), Reggie's Prayer (1996), the Showtime film The Right Connections (1997), Deadly Rhapsody (2001), Finishing the Game (2007) and 1040 (2010), as well as a television and movie producer. Despite public attacks about his financial status, after meeting at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas in April 2001, it was Hammer (credited as a producer) who provided the much needed funding to filmmaker Justin Lin for Better Luck Tomorrow (2002). In its first ever film acquisition, MTV Films eventually acquired Better Luck Tomorrow after it debuted at The Sundance Film Festival. The director said, \\"Out of desperation, I called up MC Hammer because he had read the script and liked it. Two hours later, he wired the money we needed into a bank account and saved us.\\" Hammer appeared in two cable television movies. At the age of 39, he was one of the producers for the VH1 movie Too Legit: The M.C. Hammer Story, starring Romany Malco and Tangi Miller as his wife, which aired on December 19, 2001. The film is a biopic which chronicles the rise and fall of the artist. \\"2 Legit To Quit: The Life Story of M.C. Hammer\\" became the second highest-rated original movie in the history of VH1 and broadcast simultaneously on BET. \\"The whole script came from me,\\" says Hammer, \\"I sat down with a writer and gave him all the information.\\" In 2003, Hammer appeared on The WB's first season of The Surreal Life, a reality show known for assembling an eclectic mix of celebrities to live together. He was also a dance judge on the 2003 ABC Family TV series Dance Fever. Additionally, he appeared on VH1's And You Don't Stop: 30 Years of Hip-Hop (2004) as well as in 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s (2008), a countdown which he was also commentator on. His eldest child, A'Keiba Burrell, was a contestant on MTV's Rock the Cradle in April 2008 (which Hammer also made appearances on). Hammer had shown an interest in having his own reality show with specific television networks at one point. Already being a part of shows for VH1 and The WB (I Married... M.C. Hammer and The Surreal Life), it was later confirmed he would appear in Hammertime on A&E; Network in the summer of 2009. This reality show was about his personal, business and family life. The following year, Hammer appeared on Live with Regis and Kelly June 3, 2009 to promote his show which began June 14, 2009 at 10 PM EST. In August 2008, a new ESPN ad featured Hammer in it, showcasing his single \\"I Got Gigs'\\" (from his DanceJamtheMusic album). The commercial was for Monday Night Football's upcoming football season. This is not the first commercial in more recent years that Hammer has been in, or his songs/raps/dancing was used for and included in such as Lay's, Hallmark Cards, Purell, Lysol, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Citibank, etc. On February 1, 2009, Hammer and Ed McMahon were featured in a Super Bowl XLIII commercial for Cash4Gold. In addition to appearing in television commercials, M.C. Hammer's music has also been used in television shows and movies, especially \\"U Can't Touch This\\" during The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990), Hot Shots! (1990), The Super (1991), Doogie Howser, M.D. (1992), Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996), Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Into the Wild (2007), Tropic Thunder (2008), Dancing with the Stars (2009), Glee (2010) and many more. Additionally, \\"This Is What We Do\\" was a 1990 track by Hammer (featuring B Angie B) for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and soundtrack. Tracks \\"That's What I Said\\" and \\"Feel My Power\\" were used for the Rocky V film and soundtrack. Some examples of other raps by Hammer used in movies and television were \\"Addams Groove\\" (The Addams Family), \\"Pray\\" (License to Wed), \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" (Hot Rod), \\"I Got It From The Town\\" (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift), \\"Help Lord, Won't You Come\\" (Kingdom Come), \\"Let's Go Deeper\\" (Beverly Hills, 90210) and \\"Straight to My Feet\\" (Street Fighter), among others. Along with Betty White, Hammer was a voice actor on the September 17, 2010 episode of Glenn Martin, DDS called \\"Step-brother\\". In 2016, MC Hammer appeared as himself in an episode of Uncle Grandpa on Cartoon Network. Hammer has most recently been a spokesman for 3M Command Strips and Starburst. =Dancer, choreographer and entertainer= M.C. Hammer's dance style not only helped pave the way for the Bay Area movement called Hyphy, but also helped to bring hip-hop and rap to the Bay Area. His dancing skills are still taught to this day. With his popular trademark Hammer Pants, one phenomenal difference from Hammer versus other performers during his heyday was that he was an entertainer, both during live shows and in music videos. His flamboyant dancing was as much a part of his performances as rapping and musical instruments were. With high-energy dance routines, he is often considered one of the greatest dancers. While adding his own techniques, Hammer adopted styles from James Brown and The Nicholas Brothers such as the splits, and feverish choreographed dance routines including leaps and slides, most notably. His creation of such dances as \\"Hammer Dance\\" (or the \\"Typewriter Dance\\"), \\"The Bump\\" (from \\"U Can't Touch This\\") and the use of \\"The Running Man\\" and the \\"Butterfly,\\" among others, made his flashy and creative dance skills unlike any others at the time. Hammer's showmanship and elaborate stage choreography, involving fifteen dancers, twelve backup singers, seven live musicians and two disc jockeys, gave him a powerful visual appeal. Hammer was the first rap artist to put together a choreographed show of this type, and his visual flair attracted heavy airplay for his videos on MTV, which at the time had a predominantly white viewership that had aired little rap music before Hammer. During a 1990 visit from M.C. Hammer (accompanied by his friend Fab Five Freddy) on Yo! MTV Raps, one of the dancers whom Hammer was holding auditions for was a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez. At the height of his career, Hammer had his legs insured for a substantial amount of money (into the millions), as mentioned in an interview by Maria Shriver in the early 1990s. He later suffered an injury to his knee that halted his dancing career for a period of time. Eventually, BET ranked Hammer as the 7th Best Dancer Of All Time. Some of Hammer's entourage, or \\"posse\\" as he called them, were also trained/skilled dancers (including Tiffany Patterson). They participated in videos and at concerts, yet too many dancers and band members eventually contributed to Hammer's downfall, proving to be too much for him to finance. Hammer stayed active in the dance media/genre, both on television shows and as co-founder of DanceJam.com (which showcased dance competitions and instructional videos on all the latest dance styles) until he and his partner Geoffrey Arone sold it to Grind Networks. Well known for bringing choreography to hip-hop, many of his dancing skills can still be seen on dance-focused and social networking sites. \\"Dance is unlike any other social medium. It's the core of our culture\\", Burrell told Wired News. In addition to his websites and other Internet appearances, Hammer has also appeared demonstrating much of his dancing abilities on talk shows such as The Arsenio Hall Show, Soul Train, Late Night with Conan O'Brien (performing O'Brien's famous \\"string dance\\" together as well), The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The View and was a dance judge on Dance Fever. On June 3, 2009, he performed the \\"Hammer dance\\" on Live with Regis and Kelly with Will Ferrell as co-host. While Hammer may have challenged and competed with Michael Jackson during the height of his career, they were friends, proven by a phone call Hammer had with Jackson about his \\"Too Legit to Quit\\" video which he shared on The Wendy Williams Show (July 2009). Hammer wanted to ensure he was not offended by the ending of the video where a purported Michael Jackson (seen only from behind) does the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" hand gesture with his famous glove. They also appeared together at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006, where Hammer danced in honor of The Godfather of Soul. After Jackson's death, Hammer posted his remembrance and sympathy of the superstar on Twitter. Michael's friend and fellow pop culture icon Hammer told Spinner that, \\"now that the King of Pop has passed, it's the duty of his fans and loved ones to carry Jackson's creative torch.\\" He went on to say, \\"Michael Jackson lit the fuse that ignited the spirit of dance in us all. He gave us a song and a sweet melody that will never die. Now we all carry his legacy with joy and pride.\\" Personal life At the time of his first album, M.C. Hammer opened his own music management firm. As a result of the success of his third album, Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em, Hammer had amassed approximately US$33 million. US$12 million was used to build his Xanadu-like home in Fremont, California, 30 miles (50 km) south of where he grew up. Jet reported Hammer once employed 200 people, with an annual payroll of US$6.8 million. The estate was sold for $5.3 million after Hammer lived in it for six years. Hammer currently resides in a large ranch-style abode situated on a two-acre corner lot in Tracy, California with his wife Stephanie of over 30 years (whom he met at a church revival meeting and married December 21, 1985). They have five children: three boys (Bobby, Jeremiah, Sammy) and two girls (Sarah, A'keiba), along with a nephew (Jamaris) and cousin (Marv) having lived with them. It was reported in July 2012, that Hammer was encouraged to marry Whitney Houston by her father at the Super Bowl in 1991. Hammer frequently posts about his life and activities on his blog \\"Look Look Look\\", as well as other social websites such as Facebook, Myspace and Twitter (being one of the earliest celebrities to contribute and join). A self-described \\"super geek\\" who's presently consulting for or investing in eight technology companies, Hammer claims to spend 10‚Äì12 hours daily working on his technology projects, and tweets 30-40 times a day. Hammer was an endorser of the SAFE California Act, which if passed in November 2012, would have replaced the death penalty. However, the proposition was defeated. =Bankruptcy, lawsuits and media reaction= Contrary to public rumor, Hammer claimed he was really never \\"down-and-out\\" as reported by the media (eventually expressed on The Opie & Anthony Show and The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2009). Originally having an estimated net worth of over $33 million according to Forbes magazine, speculations about Hammer's status first emerged during delays between albums Too Legit to Quit and The Funky Headhunter, with Hammer having spent much of his money on staff and personal luxuries. In addition to excessive spending while supporting friends and family, Hammer ultimately became $13 million in debt. With dwindling album sales, unpaid loans, a large payroll, and a lavish lifestyle, Hammer eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Oakland, CaliforniaIn re Stanley Kirk Burrell, case no. 96-42564, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (Oakland Div.). on April 1, 1996. The case was converted to Chapter 7 on September 23, 1998, but Hammer was denied a bankruptcy discharge on April 23, 2002.See generally Complaint, docket entry 1, November 21, 2011, United States v. Stanley K. Burrell, case no. 2:11-cv-03079-GEB-EFB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. Hammer's mansion was sold for a fraction of its former price. \\"My priorities were out of order,\\" he told Ebony. He claimed, \\"My priorities should have always been God, family, community, and then business. Instead they had been business, business, and business.\\" Along with Felton Pilate and other group members, Rick James sued Hammer for infringement of copyright, but the suit was settled out of court when Hammer agreed to credit James as co- composer, effectively cutting James in on the millions of dollars the record was earning. By the late 1990s, though, Hammer seemed to stabilize himself and made himself ready to undertake new projects. In 1992, Hammer had admitted in depositions and court documents to getting the idea for the song \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" from a Christian recording artist in Dallas named Kevin Christian. Christian had filed a 16 million dollar lawsuit against Hammer for copyright infringement of his song entitled \\"Oh-Oh, You Got the Shing\\". This fact, compounded with witness testimony from both Hammer's and Christian's entourages, and other evidence (including photos), brought about a settlement with Capitol Records in 1994. The terms of the settlement remain sealed. Hammer settled with Christian the following year. In 1997, just prior to beginning his ministry, M.C. Hammer (who by that time had re-adopted \\"M.C.\\") was the subject of an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show and the VH1 series Behind the Music (music from his album Inside Out V was featured in this documentary). In these appearances, Burrell admitted \\"that [he] had already used up most of [his] fortune of over $20 million, proving that money is nothing if it doesn't bring peace and if priorities are wrong\\". He would go on to express a similar point in other interviews as well. During numerous interviews on radio stations and television channels throughout the years, Hammer was constantly questioned about his bankruptcy. During an interview by WKQI-FM (95.5) for the promotion of his \\"Pioneers Of Hip Hop 2009\\" gig at the Fox Theatre in Detroit, which featured 2 Live Crew, Naughty by Nature, Too Short, Biz Markie, and Roxanne Shant√©, Hammer was asked about his finances by the Mojo in the Morning host. Hammer responded on Twitter that Mojo was a \\"coward\\" and threatened to cancel commercials for his upcoming show. On November 21, 2011, the U.S. government filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in California against Hammer to obtain a court judgment on his unpaid taxes for years 1996 and 1997.See Complaint, docket entry 1, November 21, 2011, United States v. Stanley K. Burrell, case no. 2:11-cv-03079-GEB-EFB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. In December 2011, this litigation was reported in the media. Hammer owed $779,585 in back taxes from his earnings dating back to 1996‚Äì1997 - during the years Hammer was believed to be facing his worst financial problems. After years of public and media ridicule regarding his financial problem, Hammer tried to assure fans and \\"naysayers\\" via Twitter, claiming that he had proof he had already taken care of his debt with the IRS. \\"700k ‚Ä¶ Don't get too excited .. I paid them already and kept my receipt. Stamped by a US Federal Judge\\", Hammer tweeted from his account @MCHammer. However, the District Court ruled against Hammer. He appealed but, on December 17, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected Hammer's argument that because the government had not listed those taxes in the government's proof of claim filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the government should be stopped from collecting the taxes.United States v. Stanley K. Burrell, December 17, 2015, case no. 14-15015, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. According to a 2017 episode of the Reelz TV series Broke & Famous, the situation was eventually resolved.\\"MC Hammer: Broke & Famous.\\" Broke & Famous. Exec. Prod. Joe Houlihan and Simon Lloyd. Reelz, September 29, 2017. Television. As of the making of the aforementioned Broke & Famous episode, Hammer had a reported net worth of $1.5 million. =Obstruction charges= M.C. Hammer was arrested in 2013 in Dublin, California for allegedly obstructing an officer in the performance of his duties and resisting an officer (according to \\"stop and identify\\" statutes). Hammer claims he was a victim of racial profiling by the police, stating an officer pulled out his gun and randomly asked him: \\"Are you on parole or probation?\\" Hammer stated that as he handed over his ID, the officer reached inside the car and tried to pull him out. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was \\"blasting music\\" in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner. \\"After asking Hammer who the registered owner was, he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions,\\" police spokesman Herb Walters typed in an e-mail to CNN. Hammer was booked and released from Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. A court date was scheduled, however, all charges were dropped in early March. Hammer tweeted that he was not bitter and considered what happened \\"a teachable moment.\\" =Christian beliefs and pastoral ministry= In 1984, Burrell began attending Bible studies, joined a street ministry and formed a gospel rap group known as Holy Ghost Boys featuring Jon Gibson. In 1986, Burrell along with Tramaine Hawkins, performed with Gibson's band doing several concerts at various venues such as the Beverly Theatre in Beverly Hills and recorded several rap songs. They collaborated on a song for Gibson's 1988 album (Change of Heart) called \\"The Wall\\", prior to M.C. Hammer's mainstream success. This was Contemporary Christian music's first rap hit ever. Burrell also produced \\"Son of the King\\" at that time, releasing it on his debut album. Raised Pentecostal, Hammer strayed from his Christian faith during his success, before returning to ministry. His awareness of this can be found in a film he wrote and starred in called Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie (1990), in which he also plays the charismatic preacher character named \\"Reverend Pressure\\". Nonetheless, as a tribute to his faith, Hammer vowed/promised to dedicate at least one song on each album to God. During 1991, Hammer was featured on the single \\"The Blood\\" from the BeBe & CeCe Winans album, Different Lifestyles. In 1992, the song peaked at No. 8 on the Christian charts. Hammer later reaffirmed his beliefs in October 1997, and began a television ministry called M.C. Hammer and Friends on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, as well as appearing on Praise the Lord programs where he went public about his devotion to ministry as an ordained minister. Hammer officiated at the celebrity weddings of actor Corey Feldman and Susie Sprague on October 30, 2002 (as seen on VH1's The Surreal Life), and also at M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Vince Neil and Lia Gerardini's wedding in January 2005. During an interview on TBN (between 1997 and 1998), Hammer claimed he adopted the \\"M.C.\\" back into his name which now stood for 'Man of Christ'. Hammer continued to preach while still making music, running a social media business and television show, and devotes time to prison and youth ministries. From 2009 to 2010, Hammer joined Jaeson Ma at a crusade in Asia. Minister and mentor to Ma for more than a decade, Hammer assisted and co-starred in his documentary film 1040, which explores the spread of Christianity throughout Asia. Legacy and pop culture fame Widely considered the first \\"mainstream\\" rapper, Hammer continues to entertain while sharing his legacy with other rappers (as cited on BET.com). Hammer became a fixture of the television airwaves and the big screen, with his music being used in many popular shows, movies and commercials still to this day. Hammer appeared in major marketing campaigns for companies to the point that he was criticized as a \\"sellout\\", including commercials for British Knights during the height of his career. The shoe company signed him to a $138 million deal. Hammer's impression on the music industry appeared almost instantaneous, as Digital Underground's rap \\"The Humpty Dance,\\" which was released when Hammer was still early in his career, included the lyrics \\"People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty!\\", boasting about Hammer's showmanship versus Humpty Hump (Shock G)'s inability to match it in dance. Additionally, Hammer had several costly videos, two in particular were \\"Too Legit to Quit\\" or \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" (in which many celebrities appeared) and \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\". Hammer is well known for his fashion style during the late 80s and early 90s. Hammer would tour, perform and record with his hype man 2 Bigg MC or Too Big (releasing a song in which he claimed \\"He's the King of the Hype\\"). This duo introduced the \\"shiny suit\\" and popularized Hammer pants to mainstream America, as seen in videos such as \\"(Hammer Hammer) They Put Me In A Mix\\", in which Hammer also claimed Too Big was the \\"King of Hype\\" and in an unspoken competition with Flavor Flav (hype man for Public Enemy) during the height of their careers. Hammer also established a children's foundation, which first started in Hammer's own community, called Help The Children (HTC was named after and based on his song by the same name which included a music video with a storyline from his film Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie). A Sesame Street segment features Elmo taking on the persona of MC Hammer; nicknaming himself \\"MC Elmo\\" and along with two backup singers they rap a song about the number five called \\"Five Jive\\". In 1994, British TV presenter Mark Lamarr interrupted Hammer repeatedly with Hammer's catch phrase (\\"Stop! Hammer Time!\\") in an interview filmed for The Word, which he took in good humour. He claimed Hammer was a \\"living legend\\". It was also within this interview that Hammer explained the truth about his relationship with \\"gangsta rap\\" and that he was merely changing with the times, not holding onto his old image nor becoming a \\"hardcore gangsta\\". By some accounts, this change contributed to his decline in popularity. Even in 2008, people continued to invoke Hammer's catchphrase MC Hammer's catchphrase invoked in Helsinki, Finland in 2012 In 2005, Hammer appeared in a commercial for Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company which made a humorous reference to his career. First he is shown in his distinctive clothing with his dance troupe performing \\"U Can't Touch This\\" in front of a mansion representative of his former house with a monogram H on the gable. Then there is silence and a screen card saying \\"Fifteen Minutes Later\\" appears with a view of Hammer sadly sitting on the curb in front of the same house as a crane removes the monogram H and tow trucks pull away sports cars that were parked in front. After a large \\"Foreclosed\\" sign appears, the voiceover said \\"Life comes at you fast. Be ready with Nationwide!\\" In 2006, M.C. Hammer's music catalog (approximately 40,000 songs) was sold to the music company Evergreen/BMG for nearly $3 million. Evergreen explained that the collection was \\"some of the best-selling and most popular rap songs of all time.\\" Speaking for Evergreen Copyrights, David Schulhof stated the songs \\"will emerge as a perfect fit for licensing in movies, television shows, and corporate advertising.\\" According to VH1, \\"Hammer was on the money. Hit singles and videos like \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"Too Legit To Quit\\" created a template of lavish performance values that many rap artists still follow today.\\" In March 2009, Ellen DeGeneres made plans for Hammer to be on her show (The Ellen DeGeneres Show) after he contacted her via Twitter. Hammer continues to give media interviews, such as being a guest on Chelsea Lately (June 16, 2009), where he discussed his relationship with Vanilla Ice, his stint on The Surreal Life, his show Hammertime, his family, his mansion, about him being in shape, his positive financial status and other \\"colorful topics\\" (subliminal jokes) regarding his baggy pants. In 2010, Rick Ross released \\"MC Hammer\\" from the Teflon Don album which samples Hammer's \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\". To celebrate Hammer's 50th birthday, San Francisco game maker Zynga offered up some recent player's Draw Something drawings from his fans. Other sources/services offered \\"props\\" on behalf of his special occasion and to show appreciation for his memorable persona/gimmicks used during the peak of his career. In 2012, Slaughterhouse released a single called \\"Hammer Dance\\", along with a video. \\"Hammer Dance\\" was the lead single from the Welcome to: Our House album. During the 2013 Oakland Athletics season, the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\" music video played on the Diamond Vision in between innings, usually during the middle of the 8th inning. The video featured prominent players from the San Francisco Bay Area's sports championships, such as former A's players Jose Canseco and hall of fame inductee Rickey Henderson. Influences and effect M.C. Hammer's career in rap and entertainment has influenced and been influenced by such artists as: Kool Moe Dee, Big Daddy Kane, James Brown, Prince, Michael Jackson, Kurtis Blow, Earth, Wind & Fire, Rick James, Doug E. Fresh (who joined Hammer's Bust It Records label in 1992 and issued the album Doin' What I Gotta Do with the track \\"Bustin' Out (On Funk)\\" sampling the Rick James single \\"Bustin' Out\\") & The Get Fresh Crew (Barry Bee and Chill Will), Run-DMC and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.

Brains, MC Breed, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, C+C Music Factory, Mystikal, Bell Biv DeVoe, Kris Kross, Ho Frat Hoo! and Oaktown's 357. Hammer also influenced the music industry with pop culture catchphrases and slang. Some critics complained of a lack of originality in Hammer's early productions. Entertainment Weekly described \\"U Can't Touch This\\" as 'shamelessly copying its propulsive riff from Rick James (\\"Super Freak\\"). Hammer admits, \\"When I look at Puffy with a choir, I say, 'Sure that's a take-off of what I do.\\" Notable feuds/beefs Hammer had with other rappers include: LL Cool J, Vanilla Ice, Too Short, Redman, 3rd Bass, Jay-Z, Eminem, A Tribe Called Quest and Run- DMC. Several diss tracks were featured on The Funky Headhunter. Award recipient, appearances and recognition Hammer with Chamillionaire and Mistah F.A.B. at TechCrunch on July 24, 2008.

He is also known by the Yiddish appellation der Alter (\\"the Elder\\") and as the Alter of Slabodka. Many of his pupils were to become major leaders of Orthodox Judaism in the USA and Israel. Early years Finkel was orphaned at an early age, and not much is known about his formative years. At a young age, he went to study at the Kelm Talmud Torah under Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv, \\"the Alter of Kelm.\\" Philosophical approach Despite his influence, he was an intensely private person. Yet, he personally oversaw the complete student body of the yeshiva. His motto was summed up in the words Gadlus HaAdam (\\"Greatness of Man\\"). He stressed the need for mussar (ethics), using works such as those of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, polishing the character traits of his students so that they would aspire to become gedolim - \\"great ones\\" in all areas of both scholarship, and personal ethics. He spent ten out of every twelve months with his students full-time, only returning to his wife for the Jewish holidays. He had special agents who would keep an eye out all over Europe for teenagers with an aptitude for both scholarship and leadership, recruiting them and bringing them back to Slobodka. He attained unusual success, and his students subsequently reflected that he was a master of the human psyche and knew just which psychological buttons to press to give direction to his students' lives. He would monitor the extracurricular behavior of students, judging their character faults and strengths. He was responsible for deciding which boys would share rooms together, weighing the strengths of one against the other. Some were chosen to be his personal assistants. He stressed the importance of outer appearance and the need for neatness and cleanliness. He did not want the image of the poor, tattered, down-trodden yeshiva bochur (yeshiva student) to be associated with the alumni of his institution. The rabbinical and Talmudical graduates of the Slobodka Yeshiva tried to live up to a higher code of dress and deportment, to the point of being accused of being dandies. He would send teams of his trained prized pupils to places that needed a boost in religious observance and learning of Torah. His own son, Eliezer Yehudah (Leizer Yudel) Finkel eventually became the head of the far older Mir yeshiva, eventually leading it all the way to Jerusalem where it is today the largest post-high school yeshiva in the world with thousands of students. Opposition His main opponents in the \\"yeshiva world\\" were first and foremost Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik and as a result the Brisk yeshivas, who were adamantly opposed to any changes in what they believed to be the time-tested ways of yeshiva education. To this day, their yeshivos, based mainly in Jerusalem today, do not teach mussar (ethics) as a separate curriculum, but focus on pure Talmud study. Finkel's opponents argued that the pure focus on the Talmud would automatically create greatness in both scholarship and ethics. But Finkel believed that, while this might have been true in previous generations, the modern age was different. In his view, too many new enticing secular ideologies, such as Socialism and Zionism and the very real lure of atheism in universities, were becoming a replacement for traditional Judaism for many young Jews. He was determined to prove that what he had to offer was more appealing than anything the outside world could offer. Land of Israel Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, tended by his yeshiva students, in the British Mandate of Palestine in his last years. Finkel staged one of the most dramatic moves in the history of yeshivos. In the 1920s he decided to create a branch of his yeshiva in the Land of Israel, together with the dean Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein, setting it up in Hebron and sending waves of hand-picked students there, culminating with his own permanent aliyah, \\"going up\\", to the Holy Land two years before his passing. In the region of Palestine he founded his own institution in the town of Hebron called Knesses Yisroel - \\"Gathering of Israel\\", which moved to Jerusalem following the massacre of Jews during the 1929 Palestine riots in which many of the yeshiva students perished. This yeshiva today, Yeshivas Chevron in Jerusalem, has about a thousand students and is one of the most prestigious Lithuanian yeshivos in Israel. Influence During his lifetime, he molded many who would eventually become the heads (roshei yeshiva) of most of the so-called Lithuanian-style yeshivas that were established in the United States and Israel during the 20th century, and which continue to grow dramatically in the 21st century. Some of the more famous students are: * Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (son of the Alter) of the Mirrer Yeshiva in Mir and Jerusalem, Israel * Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin of Brooklyn, New York * Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas in Brooklyn, New York * Rabbi Avrohom Eliyahu Kaplan of Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin, Germany * Rabbi Aaron Kotler, of Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, New Jersey * Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim: Rabbinical Seminary of America in Queens * Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel in Baltimore, Maryland * Rabbi Yechezkel Sarna, head of Chevron Yeshiva, Jerusalem, Israel * Rabbi Isaac Sher, head of the Slabodka Yeshiva of Bnei Brak, Israel * Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg of Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin, Germany The Alter did not author any books or essays personally, but some of his ethical discourses were published under the name Ohr HaTzafun - \\"The Hidden Light\\" (also meaning \\"The Light of the Hidden (One)\\"). The word Ha-Tz[a]-F[u]-N also being the four initials of his name, but not in order (\\"Hirsh-Tzvi-Finkel-Nota\\"). The title alludes to the hidden and mysterious nature of its subject, as he used to sign his name as Hatzafun.

He was among the most influential early bebop musicians, which included other greats such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Bud Powell. Gordon's height was , so he was also known as \\"Long Tall Dexter\\" and \\"Sophisticated Giant\\". His studio and performance career spanned over 40 years. Gordon's sound was commonly characterized as being \\"large\\" and spacious and he had a tendency to play behind the beat. He was known for inserting musical quotes into his solos, with sources as diverse as \\"Happy Birthday\\" and well known melodies from the operas of Wagner. This is not unusual in jazz improvisation, but Gordon did it frequently enough to make it a hallmark of his style. One of his major influences was Lester Young. Gordon, in turn, was an early influence on John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Rollins and Coltrane then influenced Gordon's playing as he explored hard bop and modal playing during the 1960s. Gordon was known for his genial and humorous stage presence. He was an advocate of playing to communicate with the audience., which was his musical approach as well. His improvisation was remarkably engaging and intelligent, but never gratuitously complex or unusual. It was always a conversation simultaneously delightful and intellectual. One of his idiosyncratic rituals was to recite lyrics from each ballad before playing it. A photograph by Herman Leonard of Gordon taking a smoke break at the Royal Roost in 1948 is one of the iconic images in jazz photography. Cigarettes were a recurring theme on covers of Gordon's albums. Gordon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in the Bertrand Tavernier film Round Midnight (Warner Bros, 1986), and he won a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist, for the soundtrack album The Other Side of Round Midnight (Blue Note Records, 1986). He also had a cameo role in the 1990 film Awakenings. In 2018, Gordon's album Go (Blue Note, 1962) was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Life and career=Early life= Dexter Keith Gordon was born on February 27, 1923 in Los Angeles, California. His father, Dr. Frank Gordon, was one of the first African American doctors in Los Angeles who arrived in 1918 after graduating from Howard Medical School in Washington, D.C. Among his patients were Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton. Dexter's mother, Gwendolyn Baker, was the daughter of Captain Edward Baker, one of the five African American Medal of Honor recipients in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Gordon played clarinet from the age of 13, before switching to saxophone (initially alto, then tenor) at 15. While still at school, he played in bands with such contemporaries as Chico Hamilton and Buddy Collette.Joop Visser, essay booklet with Settin' the Pace, Proper box set. Between December 1940 and 1943, Gordon was a member of Lionel Hampton's band, playing in a saxophone section alongside Illinois Jacquet and Marshal Royal. During 1944 he was featured in the Fletcher Henderson band, followed by the Louis Armstrong band, before joining Billy Eckstine. The 1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike curtailed the recording of the Hampton, Henderson, and Armstrong bands; however, they were recorded on V-Discs produced by the Army for broadcast and distribution among overseas troops. In 1943 he was featured, alongside Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, in recordings under Nat Cole for a small label not affected by the strike. =Bebop era recordings= By late 1944, Gordon was resident in New York, a regular at bebop jam sessions, and a featured soloist in the Billy Eckstine big band (If That's The Way You Feel, I Want To Talk About You, Blowin' the Blues Away, Opus X, I'll Wait And Pray, The Real Thing Happened To Me, Lonesome Lover Blues, I Love the Rhythm in a Riff). During early 1945 he was featured on recordings by Dizzy Gillespie (Blue 'n' Boogie, Groovin' High) and Sir Charles Thompson (Takin' Off, If I Had You, 20th Century Blues, The Street Beat). In late 1945 he was recording under his own name for the Savoy label. His Savoy recordings during 1945-46 included Blow Mr. Dexter, Dexter's Deck, Dexter's Minor Mad, Long Tall Dexter, Dexter Rides Again, I Can't Escape From You, and Dexter Digs In. He returned to Los Angeles in late 1946 and in 1947 was leading sessions for Ross Russell's Dial label (Mischievous Lady, Lullaby in Rhythm, The Chase, Iridescence, It's the Talk of the Town, Bikini, A Ghost of a Chance, Sweet and Lovely). After his return to Los Angeles, he became known for his saxophone duels with fellow tenorman Wardell Gray, which were a popular concert attraction documented in recordings made between 1947 and 1952 (The Hunt, Move, The Chase, The Steeplechase). The Hunt gained literary fame from its mention in Jack Kerouac's On The Road, which also contains descriptions of wild tenormen jamming in Los Angeles. Cherokee, Byas a Drink, and Disorder at the Border are other live recordings of the Gray/Gordon duo from the same concert as The Hunt. In December 1947, Gordon recorded again with the Savoy label (Settin' the Pace, So Easy, Dexter's Riff, Dextrose, Dexter's Mood, Index, Dextivity, Wee Dot, Lion Roars). Through the mid-to-late 1940s he continued to work as a sideman on sessions led by Russell Jacquet, Benny Carter, Ben Webster, Ralph Burns, Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Gerry Mulligan, Wynonie Harris, Leo Parker, and Tadd Dameron. =The 1950s= During the 1950s, Gordon's recorded output and live appearances declined as heroin addiction and legal troubles took their toll. Gordon made a concert appearance with Wardell Gray in February 1952 (The Chase, The Steeplechase, Take the A Train, Robbins Nest, Stardust) and appeared as a sideman in a session led by Gray in June 1952 (The Rubiyat, Jungle Jungle Jump, Citizen's Bop, My Kinda Love). After an incarceration at Chino Prison during 1953-55, he recorded the albums Daddy Plays the Horn and Dexter Blows Hot and Cool in 1955 and played as a sideman on the Stan Levey album, This Time the Drum's on Me. The latter part of the decade saw him in and out of prison until his final release from Folsom Prison in 1959. He was one of the initial sax players for the Onzy Matthews big band in 1959, along with Curtis Amy. Gordon continued to champion Matthews' band after he left Los Angeles for New York, but left for Europe before getting a chance to record with that band. He recorded The Resurgence of Dexter Gordon in 1960. His recordings from the mid-1950s onward document a meander into a smooth West Coast style that lacked the impact of his bebop era recordings or his subsequent Blue Note recordings. The decade saw Gordon's first entry into the world of drama. He appeared as a member (uncredited) of Art Hazzard's band in the 1950 film Young Man with a Horn. He appeared in an uncredited and overdubbed role as a member of a prison band in the movie Unchained, filmed inside Chino. Gordon was a saxophonist performing Freddie Redd's music for the Los Angeles production of Jack Gelber's play The Connection in 1960, replacing Jackie McLean. He contributed two compositions, Ernie's Tune and I Want More to the score and later recorded them for his album Dexter Calling. =New York renaissance= Gordon signed to Blue Note Records in 1961. He initially commuted from Los Angeles to New York to record, but took up residence when he regained the cabaret card that allowed him to perform where alcohol was served. The Jazz Gallery hosted his first New York performance in twelve years. The Blue Note association was to produce a steady flow of albums for several years, some of which gained iconic status. His New York renaissance was marked by Doin' Allright, Dexter Calling..., Go!, and A Swingin' Affair. The first two were recorded over three days in May 1961 with Freddie Hubbard, Horace Parlan, Kenny Drew, Paul Chambers, George Tucker, Al Harewood, and Philly Joe Jones. The last two were recorded in August 1962, with a rhythm section that featured Blue Note regulars Sonny Clark, Butch Warren and Billy Higgins. Of the two Go! was an expressed favorite. The albums showed his assimilation of the hard bop and modal styles that had developed during his years on the west coast, and the influence of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins, whom he had influenced before. The stay in New York turned out to be short lived, as Gordon got offers for engagements in England, then Europe, that resulted in a fourteen-year stay. Soon after recording A Swingin' Affair, he was gone. =Years in Europe= Over the next 14 years in Europe, living mainly in Paris and Copenhagen, Gordon played regularly with fellow expatriates or visiting players, such as Bud Powell, Ben Webster, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Kenny Drew, Horace Parlan and Billy Higgins. Blue Note's German-born Francis Wolff supervised Gordon's later sessions for the label on his visits to Europe. The pairing of Gordon with Drew turned out to be one of the classic matchups between a horn player and a pianist, much like Miles Davis with Red Garland or John Coltrane with McCoy Tyner. From this period come Our Man in Paris, One Flight Up, Gettin' Around, and Clubhouse. Our Man in Paris was a Blue Note session recorded in Paris in 1963 with backup consisting of pianist Powell, drummer Kenny Clarke, and French bassist Pierre Michelot. One Flight Up, recorded in Paris in 1964 with trumpeter Donald Byrd, pianist Kenny Drew, drummer Art Taylor, and Danish bassist Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen, features an extended solo by Gordon on the track \\"Tanya\\". Gordon also visited the US occasionally for further recording dates. Gettin' Around was recorded for Blue Note during a visit in May 1965, as was the album Clubhouse which remained unreleased until 1979. Gordon found Europe in the 1960s a much easier place to live, saying that he experienced less racism and greater respect for jazz musicians. He also stated that on his visits to the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he found the political and social strife disturbing. While in Copenhagen, Gordon and Drew's trio appeared onscreen\\"Dexter Gordon & Kenny Drew ‚Äì Pornography A Musical (1971) OST\\", YouTube video. in Ole Ege's theatrically released hardcore pornographic film Pornografi (1971), for which they composed and performed the score.David Meeker,\\"Jazz on the Screen ‚Äì A jazz and blues filmography\\", Library of Congress, Performing Arts Encyclopedia. He switched from Blue Note to Prestige Records (1965‚Äì73) but stayed very much in the hard-bop idiom, making classic bop albums like The Tower of Power! and More Power! (1969) with James Moody, Barry Harris, Buster Williams, and Albert \\"Tootie\\" Heath; The Panther! (1970) with Tommy Flanagan, Larry Ridley, and Alan Dawson; The Jumpin' Blues (1970) with Wynton Kelly, Sam Jones, and Roy Brooks; The Chase! (1970) with Gene Ammons, Jodie Christian, John Young, Cleveland Eaton, Rufus Reid, Wilbur Campbell, Steve McCall, and Vi Redd; and Tangerine (1972) with Thad Jones, Freddie Hubbard, and Hank Jones. Some of the Prestige albums were recorded during visits back to North America while he was still living in Europe; others were made in Europe, including live sets from the Montreux Jazz Festival. In addition to the recordings Gordon did under his major label contracts, live recordings by European labels and live video from his European period are available. The Danish label SteepleChase released live dates from his mid-1960s tenure at the Montmartre Jazzhus. The video was released under the Jazz Icons series. Less well known than the Blue Note albums, but of similar quality, are the albums he recorded during the 1970s for SteepleChase (Something Different, Bouncin' With Dex, Biting the Apple, The Apartment, Stable Mable, The Shadow of Your Smile and others). They again feature American sidemen, but also such Europeans as Spanish pianist Tete Montoliu and Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen. =Homecoming= At the 1980 Edison Award, Amsterdam Gordon finally returned to the United States for good in 1976. He appeared with Woody Shaw, Ronnie Mathews, Stafford James, and Louis Hayes, for a gig at the Village Vanguard in New York that was dubbed his \\"homecoming.\\" It was recorded and released by Columbia Records under that title. He noted: \\"There was so much love and elation; sometimes it was a little eerie at the Vanguard. After the last set they'd turn on the lights and nobody would move.\\" In addition to the Homecoming album, a series of live albums was released by Blue Note from his stands at Keystone Corner in San Francisco during 1978 and 1979. They featured Gordon, George Cables, Rufus Reid, and Eddie Gladden. He recorded the studio albums Sophisticated Giant with an eleven piece big band in 1977 and Manhattan Symphonie with the Live at Keystone Corner crew in 1978. The sensation of Gordon's return, renewed promotion of the classic jazz catalogs of the Savoy and Blue Note record labels, and the continued efforts of Art Blakey through 1970s and early 1980s, have been credited with reviving interest in swinging, melodic, acoustically-based classic jazz sounds after the Fusion jazz era that saw an emphasis on electronic sounds and contemporary pop influences. =Musician Emeritus= In 1978 and 1980, Gordon was the DownBeat Musician of the Year and in 1980 he was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame. The US Government honored him with a Congressional Commendation, a Dexter Gordon Day in Washington DC, and a National Endowment for the Arts award for Lifetime Achievement. In 1986, he was named a member and officer of the French Order of Arts and Letters by the Ministry of Culture in France. During the 1980s, Gordon was weakened by emphysema. He remained a popular attraction at concerts and festivals, although his live appearances and recording dates would soon become infrequent. Gordon's most memorable works from the decade were not in music but in film. He starred in the 1986 movie Round Midnight as \\"Dale Turner\\", an expatriate jazz musician in Paris during the late 1950s based loosely on Lester Young and Bud Powell. That portrayal earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In addition, he had a non-speaking role in the 1990 film Awakenings, which was posthumously released. Before that last film was released he made a guest appearance on the Michael Mann series Crime Story. Soundtrack performances from Round Midnight were released as the albums Round Midnight and The Other Side of Round Midnight, featuring original music by Herbie Hancock as well as playing by Gordon. The latter was the last recording released under Gordon's name. He was a sideman on Tony Bennett's 1987 album, Berlin. =Death= Gordon died of kidney failure and cancer of the larynx in Philadelphia, on April 25, 1990, at the age of 67.\\\\- Obituary in The New York Times =Material loss= On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Dexter Gordon among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Family Gordon's maternal grandfather was Captain Edward L. Baker, who received the Medal of Honor during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, while serving with the 10th Cavalry Regiment (also known as the Buffalo Soldiers). Gordon's father, Dr. Frank Gordon, M.D., was one of the first prominent African- American physicians and a graduate of Howard University. Dexter Gordon had a total of six children, from the oldest to the youngest: Robin Gordon (Los Angeles), California, James Canales (Los Angeles), Deidre (Dee Dee) Gordon (Los Angeles), Mikael Gordon-Solfors (Stockholm), Morten Gordon (Copenhagen) and Benjamin Dexter Gordon (Copenhagen), and seven grandchildren, Raina Moore Trider (Brooklyn), Jared Johnson (Los Angeles), and Matthew Johnson (Los Angeles), Maya Canales (San Francisco) and Jared Canales (San Francisco), Dexter Gordon Bogs (Copenhagen), Dexter Minou Flipper Gordon-Marberger (Stockholm). When he lived in Denmark, Gordon became friends with the family of the future Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, and subsequently became Lars's godfather.Joel McIver, Justice for All: The Truth about Metallica, Omnibus Press, 2004. Gordon was also survived by his widow Maxine Gordon and her son Woody Louis Armstrong Shaw III. Instruments and mouthpieces The earliest photographs of Gordon as a player show him with a Conn 30M \\"Connqueror\\" and an Otto Link mouthpiece. In a 1962 interview with the British journalist Les Tomkins, he did not refer to the specific model of mouthpiece but stated that it was made for him personally. He stated that it was stolen around 1952. The famous smoke break photo from 1948 shows him with a Conn 10M and a Dukoff mouthpiece, which he played until 1965. In the Tomkins interview he referred to his mouthpiece as a medium-chambered piece with a #5* (.090\\" under the Dukoff system) tip opening. He bought a Selmer Mark VI from Ben Webster after his 10M went missing in transit. In a Down Beat magazine interview from 1977, he referred to his current mouthpiece as an Otto Link with a #8 (.110\\" under the Otto Link system) tip opening.

It stars Dexter Gordon, Fran√ßois Cluzet and Herbie Hancock. Martin Scorsese, Philippe Noiret and Wayne Shorter appear in cameos. The protagonist jazzman, \\"Dale Turner\\", was based on a composite of real-life jazz legends Lester Young (tenor sax) and Bud Powell (piano). While the film is fictionalized, it is drawn directly from the memoir/biography Dance of the Infidels written by French author Francis Paudras, who had befriended Powell during his Paris expatriate days and on whom the character \\"Francis\\" is based. The film is a wistful and tragic portrait that captures the Paris jazz scene of the 1950s. Gordon was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a Grammy for the film's soundtrack entitled The Other Side of Round Midnight in the category for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance, Soloist. Hancock won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The soundtrack was released in two parts: Round Midnight and The Other Side of Round Midnight.  Synopsis  In 1950s New York, Dale Turner is an accomplished saxophone player barely getting by playing at local jazz clubs and struggling with drug abuse, particularly of alcohol. After talking with a fellow musician who is currently disabled by illness, Dale decides to try to improve his life by traveling to Paris and making a living playing at the Blue Note jazz club until his luck gets better. Turner arrives in Paris and is befriended by Francis, a struggling French graphic designer specializing in film posters and who lives with his daughter, his marriage having broken up. He idolizes the musician and tries desperately to help him escape alcohol abuse. With time, and after Francis allows Turner to move in with him and his daughter, Turner manages to put himself on his own feet again and starts to get by without a reliance on alcohol. He eventually decides it is time to go home to New York to see his old friends and to re-acquaint himself with his own daughter. Francis accompanies Dale, and the music community in New York is ready to accept the musician back. He writes a song dedicated to his daughter in the hope of strengthening their relationship after much time apart. He invites her to the club to hear its debut, but manages to confuse her true age and tells the audience she has just turned 16; she is actually 15, and she makes note of this to Francis, who is seated next to her in the audience. Later in the week, when Dale tries to further his bond with her by sharing a meal at a local diner, an old drug dealer recognizes him there, re-introduces himself and implies his supplies are still available to Dale. Francis tries to intervene a few times to keep Dale protected from his old suppliers, and attempts to keep up with all of them. When Francis eventually leaves and returns to Paris and his daughter, he receives a telegram from Dale's music manager saying that the musician has died in a local hospital.

It was produced by Irwin Winkler. Tavernier defied the movie studio by insisting that real-life jazz tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon play the role of Turner. Gordon, who himself played with Bud Powell in Paris in the early 1960s, helped to revise and rewrite the script. The supporting cast is likewise composed of jazz musicians (mainly from the generation which followed Gordon and Powell) such as Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson, John McLaughlin, and Wayne Shorter, among others who play the music live throughout the film. The musicians are joined by actors Fran√ßois Cluzet, Gabrielle Haker, Sandra Reaves-Phillips, Lonette McKee, and Christine Pascal.  Soundtrack  The score for the film was composed by Hancock. The soundtrack was in two parts ‚Äì Round Midnight and The Other Side of Round Midnight ‚Äì released under Dexter Gordon's name and featuring his last recordings, although he does not appear on all tracks. Both albums were produced and arranged by Hancock.  Reception  Round Midnight received a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes. = Awards = Gordon was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Hancock won the award for Best Music, Original Score.

Since the band's inception, lead vocalist Dicky Barrett, bassist Joe Gittleman, tenor saxophonist Tim \\"Johnny Vegas\\" Burton and dancer (\\"Bosstone\\") Ben Carr have remained constant members. The line-up also includes drummer Joe Sirois, saxophonist Leon Silva, guitarist Lawrence Katz, keyboardist John Goetchius, and trombonist Chris Rhodes. The Bosstones are often credited as one of the progenitors of the genre of ska punk and the creators of its subgenre ska- core, which mixes elements of ska with punk rock and hardcore. Starting with the release of their 1989 debut Devil's Night Out, the band toured and recorded extensively throughout the 1990s, becoming influential in the development of the American third-wave ska scene and was one of the first bands to popularize the genre in the musical mainstream. They reached their commercial peak with their platinum-selling 1997 album Let's Face It and its hit single \\"The Impression That I Get\\". The band had released seven studio albums, three EPs and a live album by the time they announced a hiatus in December 2003. In 2007, the Bosstones reunited to resume recording and touring, and have since released three more studio albums. From 1994 to 2002, and since 2007, they have hosted the annual Hometown Throwdown music festival, held annually around Christmas time in Downtown Boston. History=Early history (1983‚Äì1988)= The band's roots lie in the hardcore scene of the early 1980s, along with a strong influence from the British 2 Tone ska scene of the 1970s. Bassist Joe Gittleman played with local hardcore band Gang Green, while vocalist Dicky Barrett was a member of Impact Unit and, later on, Cheapskates. The Cheapskates lineup went through frequent changes and would feature members of Gang Green on occasion. It was through Cheapskates that a core lineup coalesced around Barrett, Gittleman, Tim \\"Johnny Vegas\\" Burton (saxophone), Nate Albert (guitar), Josh Dalsimer (drums), Tim Bridwell (trumpet) and Ben Carr (a ubiquitous, dancing non-musician onstage presence, later credited as \\"Bosstone\\"). The group decided on the name, \\"the Bosstones\\" as a reference to the city near their hometowns. While some of the band members were influenced by bands such as AC/DC, Social Distortion, Mot√∂rhead, The Clash and Stiff Little Fingers, Barrett had become enthralled with 2 Tone ska, which was in the tail end of its prominence. In 1987, the Bosstones made their recorded debut when they were featured on the Mash It Up ska compilation. The Bosstones' contribution was \\"The Cave\\", and \\"Ugly\\". Another early recording, \\"Drums and Chickens,\\" appeared on the 1989 ska compilation Mashin' Up The Nation. By the time Mashin' Up The Nation was released, the Bosstones had temporarily disbanded in order for Albert and Gittleman to finish high school. After their graduation, the band reunited. Around this time, it was brought to the band's attention that an a cappella group, The Bosstones, had already used the name during the 1950s. A bartender friend arbitrarily suggested that they become the \\"Mighty Mighty Bosstones\\", in order to avoid any possible legal hassles, to which the band agreed. =Taang! years (1989‚Äì1992)= Despite not consistently drawing large crowds at their live shows, the Taang! record label gave the band a recording contract which would result in the Devil's Night Out album, produced by Paul Q. Kolderie. The album was released to positive local and lukewarm national reaction during a time when ska was struggling to move out of the American underground. The band found resistance from ska purists who did not like that the band were not playing traditional ska while hardcore fans were against the ska and heavy metal elements in the music. Despite the initial reaction, Devil's Night Out has gone on to become one of the band's most popular albums. The Bosstones in trademark plaid. It was during this time that the band's trademark plaid clothing came to be. After a show where Barrett wore plaid, fans started to show up wearing it as well. It was noticeable enough that the band was approached by the Converse sneaker company to promote their new line of Chuck Taylor sneakers. The band accepted the proposal and were seen in several television commercials promoting the sneakers. By this time, Tim Bridewell had left the band, to be replaced by Dennis Brockenborough (trombone) and Kevin Lenear (saxophone). The band's next release was an EP titled Where'd You Go?. The EP featured the title track as well as cover versions of Aerosmith's \\"Sweet Emotion\\", Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\", Van Halen's \\"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\\" and a new version of \\"Do Somethin' Crazy\\", originally featured on Devil's Night Out. In 1991, the band set out on their first full American tour. It was during the first leg of touring that drummer Josh Dalsimer would leave the band to pursue a college education. He would be replaced by Joe Sirois, who Barrett met at Bunker Hill Community College. Sirois would immediately join his new bandmates in the recording studio to start work on the band's second album. Once again produced by Paul Q. Kolderie, More Noise and Other Disturbances was released in June 1992. The band would film a video for the song \\"Where'd You Go?\\" which had previously been available on the EP of the same name (though the band had also recorded a video for \\"Guns and the Young\\", the video was not finished until a few years after it was recorded. During this era, the band published a newsletter for their fans titled 737. =Mainstream success and Big Rig Records (1993‚Äì2001)= The band signed to their first major label when they joined the Mercury Records roster and soon recorded the Ska-Core, the Devil, and More EP. Released in March 1993, it was largely a collection of cover songs. Four of the seven tracks paid homage to the band's influences: The Angry Samoans' \\"Lights Out\\", Minor Threat's \\"Think Again\\", SSD's \\"Police Beat\\" and The Wailers' \\"Simmer Down\\". Three live tracks were included as well. The EP contained one new studio track \\"Someday I Suppose,\\" which would later appear on the band's third full-length album. Produced by Tony Platt, the band's third LP, Don't Know How to Party contained a cover of Stiff Little Fingers' song \\"Tin Soldiers\\" as well as a vocal appearance by Daryl Jennifer of Bad Brains. A video was also filmed for \\"Someday I Suppose\\" and it received minor airplay on MTV. Though the footage was originally intended to serve as a promo for the Bosstones debut on Mercury, the label liked the footage and turned it into a single. The band would also appear on the 1994 Kiss My Ass tribute to Kiss album, covering \\"Detroit Rock City\\". Mercury Records released it as a single, appearing on 7-inch green vinyl and backed by the original Kiss version of the song. Soon after, the band found themselves invited by fellow Bostonian Steven Tyler, to open up for Aerosmith at their New Year's Eve concert in Boston. While it was not the most successful show the Bosstones had played, it ensured that the Bosstones started 1994 on the road as they had intended. The band released their fourth album, Question the Answers, in October 1994. The album featured production work by the Butcher Brothers, Paul Q. Kolderie and Ross Humphrey. It was at this time that the band decided it wanted to release their albums on vinyl, leading to a partnership with Mercury Records to form Big Rig Records, a vanity label that allowed the band to release their albums on vinyl. The Big Rig vinyl versions often contained a bonus track not seen on the cassette or CD versions. Besides touring, the band found itself making their network television debut on The Jon Stewart Show and hosting MTV's 120 Minutes. They also contributed a new version of \\"Where'd You Go?\\" to the Alicia Silverstone movie Clueless. The band also made an appearance in the film, performing the songs \\"Where'd You Go?\\" and \\"Someday I Suppose\\" during a college fraternity party scene. On top of their TV and film appearances, the band was added to the main stage of the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Mercury set about repromoting Question the Answers by adding a second disc with five B-side tracks. The EP was titled Here We Go Again and it was compiled by Barrett at the request of Mercury. After touring as part of the 1996 Warped Tour lineup (which they would repeat the following year), the Bosstones began work on their next studio album. Released in 1997, Let's Face It, would prove to be the band's biggest seller, mostly due to its first single \\"The Impression That I Get\\", which reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album was followed by Video Stew, a VHS compilation of the band's twelve music videos. The mainstream exposure led to the band's appearance on Sesame Street's Elmopalooza television special and Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album, in which they performed the song \\"The Zig Zag Dance\\" with the Muppet The Count. The band also made their Saturday Night Live debut, performing \\"The Impression That I Get\\". Capitalizing on the band's popularity, Mercury released the band's live album, Live From the Middle East in October 1998. The album was recorded live in Cambridge, Massachusetts at The Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub during the band's annual end-of-the-year Hometown Throwdown from 1997. In 1999, the band contributed their cover version of the song, \\"Rudie Can't Fail,\\" to the Burning London Clash tribute compilation. Shortly after all of these releases, Kevin Lenear quit the band to work on his own material and was replaced by Roman Fleysher. Founding member Nate Albert also left in order to obtain a degree in political theory from Brown University. His next musical venture would be as a member of Evan Dando‚Äôs re-formed Lemonheads before forming The Kickovers, which focused more on a 1970's punk sound than ska. Albert eventually became involved in band management, handling bands such as Bayside and Lost City Angels. Albert's replacement on guitar was Lawrence Katz. In 2000, the band released Pay Attention which failed to meet expectations set by the previous album. \\"So Sad to Say\\", was released as a single, but it never reached a position higher than No. 22 on the Billboard charts. Ultimately, the album did not sell as well as their previous release. This was to be the band's last album with Mercury Records, who along with Polygram, had become part of the Universal Music Group who subsequently merged Island Records and Def Jam Recordings forming the new Island Def Jam label. The band, unhappy with the way the newly formed label had been handling them, asked for a release from their contract, to which the label agreed. \\"Pay Attention\\" was also the last album for Dennis Brockenborough who had already formed his own band, Chubby, for which he sang and played guitar. Brockenborough's replacement was former Spring Heeled Jack member, Chris Rhodes. Spring Heeled Jack had dissolved in 2000, and Rhodes had recently taken a vacant trombone position with Bim Skala Bim when he received the invitation to join. =SideOneDummy and hiatus announcement (2002‚Äì2003)= The band soon announced their return to an independent label when they signed with SideOneDummy Records. In July 2002, the band released A Jackknife to a Swan and from it the song \\"You Gotta Go!\\" was released as a single and video. The band continued to tour but in December 2003, they announced their decision to go on a hiatus and were forced to forgo that year's Hometown Throwdown. One contributing factor was that several band members were reported to already be busy with other bands and side projects. Another factor was that the band had been touring, almost non-stop, since 1991, and some of the band members desired a break. On September 12, 2004, the band performed along with other punk rock groups in a tribute concert for Johnny Ramone, in which the proceeds were given to support cancer research. Barrett remarked, \\"When the Ramones say hop, this cretin starts hopping.\\" The concert was later made into the 2006 documentary film Too Tough to Die: A Tribute to Johnny Ramone.Too Tough to Die: A Tribute to Johnny Ramone =Activities during hiatus (2004‚Äì2006)= After the hiatus announcement, several members went on to work on other projects and bands. Barrett became the announcer on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! late night talk show. In 2005, he became the host of the Mighty Morning Show on Los Angeles radio's Indie 103.1 FM. In March 2006, he was dismissed from the radio station.Reed, Mack. \\"Dicky Barrett Speaks: 'I Was Fired that Day'\\" , LAVoice.org, 24 March 2006. Before the hiatus announcement, Gittleman had already formed a side project band named Avoid One Thing featuring members of Darkbuster, the Raging Teens and Spring Heeled Jack. The band released two albums for SideOneDummy before announcing their own hiatus in 2005. Sirois recorded and toured with Nate Albert's next band, Kickovers, and also played drums for the Street Dogs and Frank Black. Rhodes went on to play with The Toasters until his departure in 2006. Rhodes had just joined Bim Skala Bim before the Bosstones' hiatus came to an end and left Bim Skala Bim as a result. He also performed with former Spring Heeled Jack bandmate Rick Omonte in The Mountain Movers and as a fill-in trombonist for Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, and NOFX. Fleysher continued his pursuit of a professional pilot's license. In 2005, after taking classes near his home in South Florida and working as a flight instructor in his spare time, he was hired as an airline pilot for CommutAir, a Continental Airlines regional affiliate based in Plattsburgh, New York. After a short stint with the company, he began flying as a charter pilot in Los Angeles, California. Burton and his family moved to Los Angeles where he became active in the movie business. Besides working for a Hollywood agent, he wrote several scripts and developed projects for television. He also contributed saxophone for a Cypress Hill song. In 2007, he appeared in the film Crazy, which was inspired by the life of Hank Garland. Katz formed a band named Resistant. Katz has also played guitar on several motion picture soundtracks including Aquamarine, The Good Night and London, the latter recorded in collaboration with The Crystal Method. =Reunion and the future (2007‚Äìpresent)= The Bosstones playing Fenway Park in 2011 Because the band left the possibility of playing together again open, rumors and speculation frequently circulated that a reunion was inevitable. The hiatus of Joe Gittleman's band, Avoid One Thing, fueled further speculation of such a reunion. During an Alternative Press Acoustic Session, members of fellow Boston area ska band Big D and the Kids Table hinted that the Bosstones were in fact reuniting for another Hometown Throwdown. Jerry Mattes, the creator of the band's bulldog mascot, also acknowledged the chances of a reunion and announced that he was designing a new logo for the band. On October 11, 2007, on Boston Radio Station WBCN, Dicky Barrett confirmed what he called \\"the worst kept secret in Boston\\": the announcement that the Bosstones would indeed play a tenth official Hometown Throwdown at Cambridge's famed Middle East club on December 26‚Äì30, 2007. Barrett would not confirm any long-term plans for the band. Soon after Barrett's announcement, Gittleman declared that the band intended to record three new songs to be included on an upcoming collection of unreleased material and vinyl B-sides. The album, titled Medium Rare, was released on December 18, 2007. The three new songs marked the first new material recorded since the 2002 release of A Jackknife to a Swan. After the 2007 Throwdown, the Bosstones played a few shows every couple of months. At two of the March shows in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel served as a guest star on bass clarinet during \\"The Impression That I Get\\". Former saxophonist Lenear rejoined the band, replacing Fleysher, whose job prevented him from being able to play with the band. Despite the activity, the Bosstones remained non- committal on whether they would record and release a studio album. They did make it known that they would no longer tour at the frequency they were known for in the past. On May 15, 2008, it was reported that the Bosstones would be embarking on a short United States tour in July with the Dropkick Murphys. During the tour, the Bosstones made three stops at Boston Red Sox minor league ballparks. On October 20, 2008, their website announced that they would return to the Middle East in Cambridge to play an eleventh Hometown Throwdown on December 26‚Äì29. In late 2008, the game Rock Band 2 was released and featured a re-recorded version of \\"Where'd You Go?\\" that the band had recorded earlier in the year. On 4 November 2008, a MySpace blog announced the recording of a new album, and streamed two new songs, \\"The Impossible Dream\\" and \\"Next to Nothing\\". On July 29, 2009, the band announced the completion of tracking for the album. On October 16, 2009, the album title was announced to be Pin Points and Gin Joints and a free download of the song \\"Graffiti Worth Reading\\" was made available. The release date was later stated as December 8, 2009. The band continued to tour through the summer of 2009 with shows in Buffalo, New York, Providence, Rhode Island, Asbury Park, New Jersey, Seattle, Washington, San Francisco, California, Anaheim, California, Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, and Victoria, British Columbia where they performed at the Victoria Ska Fest with Voodoo Glow Skulls, The Slackers and Chris Murray. The band toured during the summer of 2010 with Teenage Bottlerocket and the Flatliners. They also hosted their annual Hometown Throwdown festival over three nights in December, 2010. In August 2011, Chris Rhodes posted a Facebook update stating that The Mighty Mighty Bosstones had begun work on their next album. The album, titled The Magic of Youth, was released on December 6, 2011. March 2017 saw the release of their first recording in six years with a limited edition vinyl 7\\" featuring a cover version of the Burt Bacharach song, \\"What the World Needs Now Is Love\\" backed with the track \\"I Won‚Äôt Go Out Like That\\". In the time between releases, the lineup saw the addition of former Cherry Poppin' Daddies keyboard player, John Goetchius in 2008 and Leon Silva in 2016 to replace Kevin Lenear who departed the band for a second time earlier that same year. In September 2017, Tim Burton announced in a post Riot Fest interview that the band was working on a new album set for release in early 2018. According to guitarist Lawrence Katz and producer Ted Hutt's Instagram accounts, recording started on Friday, November 17 at Kingsize Soundlabs in Los Angeles, California. The new album's title was announced to be While We're at It. While We're at It, the band's tenth album, was released on June 15, 2018. It is the final part of a musical trilogy that began with Pin Points and Gin Joints in 2009 followed by The Magic of Youth in 2011. For the initial 2018 tour dates supporting the album, Silva could not participate due to his commitments performing with Justin Timberlake. To temporarily fill in for Silva, the band brought in Roman Fleysher and Peter \\"JR\\" Wasilewski of Less Than Jake to play saxophone on select dates. Big Rig Records Big Rig Records started as a vanity label in 1993 due to the band's desire to release their records on vinyl. While the band wanted to release their albums on vinyl, the label had ceased pressing albums in that format. A partnership between Mercury and the band resulted in the label continuing to handle the conventional CD and cassette versions of the albums while allowing the band's Big Rig label to focus on the vinyl editions. The new label immediately issued re-releases of Don't Know How To Party and Ska-Core, The Devil, and More on colored vinyl. Besides the band's own albums, additional releases include the first CD release of Dicky Barrett's previous band Impact Unit, as well as Vow Of Poverty by the Boston punk band Mung, and Half Hour Of Power by Sum 41. Additionally, the label also released a benefit compilation featuring various artists titled Safe And Sound: A Benefit In Response To The Brookline Clinic Violence, as well as, You Decide: Warped Tour 2000 Sampler, a sampler of bands featured on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour. The first new release under this partnership was Question the Answers and it continued through Pay Attention, the band's final album with the Island Def Jam Music Group, the label formed after the merger of Mercury Records, Island Records, and Def Jam Recordings. After leaving Mercury, the vinyl release of A Jackknife to a Swan was handled directly by SideOneDummy, the band's label at the time. Since the band's return from hiatus, Big Rig has been run exclusively by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones as their own independent record label, handling all of their new releases.

Originally comprising vocalist and guitarist Sammy James, Jr., guitarist Graham Tyler, bassist John Paul Ribas and drummer Will Rockwell- Scott, the band has released four studio albums - People Get Ready (2000), Electric Sweat (2003), Alive & Amplified (2004) and Have Mercy (2007). The current lineup includes founding members James and Rockwell-Scott, guitarist Chris Isom and bassist Reno Bo. History The band formed in 1996, after Graham Tyler responded to an ad that former 2 Skinnee J's guitarist, Sammy James Jr., posted in a guitar store. They released their first two singles, \\"Taking Me Apart\\" and \\"Love is Everywhere\\" in 1998. The band takes its name from two lead singers for the band Can, Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki. The band came out with their first EP in 1999, followed by their first album, People Get Ready, in 2000 on the Estruslabel. In early 2002, the band won the New York Regional Poll in The 1st Annual Independent Music Awards for \\"My Dear Persephone\\" They broke up shortly afterwards, but soon reunited at the behest of The Donnas. After shows with The White Stripes and The Greenhornes, the band decided to record another record with Jim Diamond. Electric Sweat came out in 2002 and the band toured with longtime friends the Strokes and Swedish garage rockers the Hives. This tour led to their signing with Columbia Records, followed by appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. During this time, Sammy James Jr. penned the title track in the Jack Black movie School of Rock. He also wrote the closing theme \\"Tread Lightly Rosie Grier.\\" In 2003, at Lollapolooza, the band began playing new songs, such as \\"Primitive Condition\\" which would appear on the Matrix-produced album, Alive and Amplified. The song became the band's biggest hit, appearing in the Madden 2005, Shaun White Snowboarding, and in the ATV Offroad Fury 3 soundtrack. \\"Alive and Amplified\\" broke into the UK Singles Chart at No. 38, and appeared in the 2005 remake of Fun with Dick and Jane, as well as the 2006 film Grandma's Boy. They also contributed to the Burnout 3 soundtrack, with another single from that album, \\"Shake that Bush Again.\\" Soon the band toured with Kings of Leon. The band traded labels for V2 Records in 2005. The band's album \\"Have Mercy\\" was to have been released on V2 Records in summer 2007 (originally set for January 2007, and then spring, according to V2 marketing materials). Due to the reorganization of V2 announced in January 2007, the album was not released on that label, but instead came out on June 19 on indie label Elixia Records. In 2007, the band recorded a cover version of Cher's \\"Just Like Jesse James\\" for Engine Room Recordings' compilation album Guilt by Association, which appeared in September 2007. Around this time, they also recorded the \\"spring soundtrack\\" for DKNY jeans. In 2008 the band is in the studio recording their fifth album and made a cameo appearance in Ben Stiller's film Tropic Thunder, in addition to contributing covers of \\"I Just Want to Celebrate\\" and \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" to the film's soundtrack. Sammy James Jr. mentored a young rocker for an episode of the award-winning MTV series Made. In April 2019 it was announced the band would play the Mercury Lounge on July 19 as part of the venue's 25th anniversary celebrations. The show sold out immediately. In May, a second show was added for July 20. Side projects Guitarist Chris Isom formed a band, Loud Owls, while bassist Reno Bo played bass with Albert Hammond, Jr., putting his solo album on hold. Sammy James Jr. played New York City with bands such as The Pierces, Men Without Pants and Native Korean Rock, featuring Russell Simins of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

It stars James Woods as Richard Boyle, alongside Jim Belushi, Michael Murphy and Elpidia Carrillo, with John Savage and Cynthia Gibb in supporting roles. Stone co-wrote the screenplay with Boyle. The film tells the story of an American journalist covering the Salvadoran Civil War who becomes entangled with both the FMLN and the right-wing military while trying to rescue his girlfriend and her children. The film is highly sympathetic towards the left- wing revolutionaries and strongly critical of the US-supported military, focusing on the murder of four American churchwomen, including Jean Donovan, and the assassination of Archbishop √ìscar Romero by death squads. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Woods) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Stone and Boyle). Plot Veteran photojournalist Richard Boyle (James Woods) has been taking his camera to the world's trouble spots for over 20 years. While he does good work, Boyle's fondness for booze and drugs, and his colossal arrogance, have given him a reputation that's left him practically unemployable. One morning, he finds that his wife has abandoned him, taking their child with her. Broke and with no immediate prospects, Boyle and his buddy, Doctor Rock (Jim Belushi), an out-of-work disc jockey, head to El Salvador, where Boyle is convinced that he can scrounge some lucrative freelance work amidst the nation's political turmoil. However, when Boyle and Rock witness the execution of a student by government troops just as they enter the country, it becomes clear that this war is more serious than they were expecting. After he asks a soldier for a general he met during the Football War, he and Rock are taken to him in a school-turned-barracks where both discuss the situation and he learns that the army is supplied by the United States. Feeling that El Salvador is a disaster starting to happen, Boyle eventually decides that it's time to get out, but he's reunited with an old flame named Mar√≠a (Elpidia Carrillo) and her two children (one of whom is his), and he doesn't want to leave her behind. In the meantime, both he and Maria go to a mass by Archbishop Oscar Romero. During the mass, the Archbishop is killed by an assassin sent by the far-right ARANA party (a fascist parody of the real-life ARENA party) and the army outside opens fire on the escaping crowd with Boyle and Maria barely escaping. Following this, he goes to the United States Embassy to convince the ambassador to cut aid for the Salvadoran government as their human rights abuses increase but is denied and is told to leave the country for his own safety, prompting him to leave the embassy in anger. While attempting to get her out of the country, Boyle is harassed by the military due to his profession and eventually leads to the deaths of innocent people either close to him or Mar√≠a by death squads. John Cassady (John Savage), Boyle's friend and fellow photojournalist, is also killed during a battle between the government and rebels in Santa Ana when the Salvadoran army starts using American vehicles and air support to crush the rebels. Boyle and Mar√≠a eventually leave the country towards the United States. However, upon entering California, their bus is stopped by immigration officers and Mar√≠a allows herself to be deported alongside her children due to the guilt of leaving her home country behind while Boyle is arrested after desperately arguing with the officers. An epilogue reveals that Maria and her children survived and were last rumored to be in a refugee camp in Guatemala. Doctor Rock eventually returned to San Francisco. John Cassady's photos were published and Richard Boyle is still looking for Maria and her children.

Roger Ebert, a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the movie three stars out of four and wrote, \\"The movie has an undercurrent of seriousness, and it is not happy about the chaos that we are helping to subsidize. But basically it's a character study ‚Äî a portrait of a couple of burned-out free-lancers trying to keep their heads above water.\\" Walter Goodman of The New York Times wrote an unfavorable review, arguing that while \\"as an adventure film, [it] has plenty of speed, grit and grime\\", it depicts \\"improbable people doing implausible things\\" and in some cases deviates from reality \\"for the sake of heightening the drama and hammering in the political point\\". He also compared it to the work of Constantin Costa-Gavras, cinematically as well as politically. As of July 2018, Salvador holds a rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews with an average score of 7.68/10 and the consensus: \\"Despite its somewhat disjointed narrative, Oliver Stone's Salvador is a vivid and powerful political drama that sets an early tone for the director's similarly provocative future projects.\\" =Accolades= The film garnered two Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (James Woods) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen at the 59th Academy Awards ceremony.

Group rights have historically been used both to infringe upon and to facilitate individual rights, and the concept remains controversial. Organizational group rights Besides the rights of groups based upon the immutable characteristics of their individual members, other group rights cater toward organizational persons, including nation-states, trade unions, corporations, trade associations, chambers of commerce, political parties. Such organizations are accorded rights which are particular to their specifically-stated functions and their capacities to speak on behalf of their members, i.e. the capacity of the corporation to speak to the government on behalf of all individual customers or employees or the capacity of the trade union to negotiate for benefits with employers on behalf of all workers in a company. Philosophies In the political views of classical liberals and some right-libertarians, the role of the government is solely to identify, protect, and enforce the natural rights of the individual while attempting to assure just remedies for transgressions. Liberal governments that respect individual rights often provide for systemic controls that protect individual rights such as a system of due process in criminal justice. Without certain collective rights, for example, a cardinal principle in international law, enshrined in Chapter I Article I of the United Nations Charter, secures the right of \\"Self-determination of peoples\\". Without this group right, the people have no means or authority to assert the individual rights that self-determination enables the establishment of. If people are unable to determine their collective future, they are certainly unable to assert or ensure their individual rights, future and freedoms. In contrast to individual-collective dichotomy proposed by Peterson and contemporaries, critics suggest that both are necessarily connected and intertwined, rejecting the assertion that they exist in a mutually exclusive relationship. Ayn Rand, developer of the philosophy of Objectivism, asserted that a group, as such, has no rights. She maintained that only an individual can possess rights, and therefore the expression \\"individual rights\\" is a redundancy, while the expression \\"collective rights\\" is a contradiction in terms. In this view, a person can neither acquire new rights by joining a group nor lose the rights which he does possess. Man can be in a group without want or the group minority, without rights. According to this philosophy, individual rights are not subject to a public vote, a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority, the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from the will of majorities, and the smallest minority on earth is the individual. Rand offers several unique perspectives on rights, holding that 1. ontologically, rights are neither attributes nor conventions but principles of morality, having, therefore, the same epistemic status as any other moral principle; 2. rights \\"define and sanction man's freedom of action,\\"; 3\\\\. as protectors of freedom of action, rights do not mean \\"entitlements\\" to be supplied with any goods or services; 4\\\\. \\"Man's rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only by means of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslave him, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him to act against his own rational judgment.\\" and 5. rights derive from the mind's needs: for an organism that survives by means of reason, freedom is a survival-requirement:initiated force negates or paralyzes the thinking mind. Rand's overall argument is that rights protect freedom in order to protect reason. \\"Force and mind are opposites.\\" Adam Smith, in 1776 in his book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, describes the right of each successive generation, as a group, collectively, to the earth and all the earth possesses. The Declaration of Independence states several group, or collective, rights of the people as well as the states, for example the Right of the People: \\"whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\\" and the right of the States: \\"... as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.\\" See also * Constitutional economics * Constitutionalism * Corporativism ‚Äì incorporates, via state compact, jurisdictions acceded both public and private characteristics. * Disability rights movement * Environmental racism * Gay rights * Identity politics * Indigenous rights * Institutionalized discrimination * Intersex human rights * Minority rights * Racial segregation * Rule according to higher law * Special rights * Three generations of human rights Further reading * Barzilai, Gad (2003), Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities.

On March 3, 1991, King was beaten by LAPD officers after a high-speed chase during his arrest for drunk driving on I-210. A civilian, George Holliday, filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage to local news station KTLA.Lester, P. M., Visual Ethics: A Guide for Photographers, Journalists, and Filmmakers (Abingdon-on-Thames: Routledge, 2018), p. 85. The footage clearly showed an unarmed King on the ground being beaten after initially evading arrest. The incident was covered by news media around the world and caused a public furor. At a press conference, announcing the four officers involved would be disciplined, and three would face criminal charges, Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates said: \\"We believe the officers used excessive force taking him into custody. In our review, we find that officers struck him with batons between fifty-three and fifty-six times.\\" No charges were filed against the 25-year-old King. On his release, he spoke to reporters from his wheelchair, with his injuries evident: a broken right leg in a cast, his face badly cut and swollen, bruises on his body, and a burn area to his chest where he had been jolted with a 50,000-volt stun gun. He described how he had knelt, spread his hands out, and slowly tried to move so as not to make any 'stupid move,' being hit across the face by a billy club and shocked. He said he was scared for his life as they drew down on him.March 3, 1991: Rodney King beating caught on video CBS News Four officers were eventually tried on charges of use of excessive force. Of these, three were acquitted, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on one charge for the fourth. Within hours of the acquittals, the 1992 Los Angeles riots started, sparked by outrage among racial minorities over the trial's verdict and related, longstanding social issues. The rioting lasted six days and killed 63 people, with 2,383 more injured; it ended only after the California Army National Guard, the United States Army, and the United States Marine Corps provided reinforcements to re- establish control. The federal government prosecuted a separate civil rights case, obtaining grand jury indictments of the four officers for violations of King's civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended on April 16, 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to serve prison terms. The other two were acquitted of the charges. In a separate civil lawsuit in 1994, a jury found the city of Los Angeles liable and awarded King $3.8 million in damages. In 2012, King was found dead in his swimming pool two months after publishing his memoir. The coroner found evidence of alcohol and other drugs in his system and ruled that based on his history of heart problems, he had likely experienced a cardiac arrhythmia which resulted in his accidental drowning. King is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Early life King was born in Sacramento, California, in 1965, the son of Ronald and Odessa King. He and his four siblings grew up in Altadena, California. King attended John Muir High School and often talked about being inspired by his social science teacher, Robert E. Jones. King's father died in 1984 at the age of 42. On November 3, 1989, King robbed a store in Monterey Park, California. He threatened the Korean store owner with an iron bar and hit him with a wooden pole. King stole two hundred dollars in cash during the robbery. He was caught, convicted, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. He was released on December 27, 1990, after serving one year in prison. Marriage and family King had a daughter with his girlfriend, Carmen Simpson. He later married Danetta Lyles (cousin to rapper Mack 10) and had a daughter. King and Lyles were eventually divorced. He later married and had a daughter with Crystal Waters. This marriage ended in divorce. 1991 police assault in Los Angeles Early in the morning of March 3, 1991, King, with his friends Bryant Allen and Freddie Helms, were driving a 1987 Hyundai Excel west on the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. The three had spent the night watching basketball and drinking at a friend's house in Los Angeles. At 12:30 a.m., officers Tim and Melanie Singer, husband and wife members of the California Highway Patrol, noticed King's car speeding on the freeway. They pursued King with lights and sirens, and the pursuit reached 117 mph (188 km/h), while King refused to pull over. King later said he tried to outrun the police because a charge of driving under the influence would violate his parole for his previous robbery conviction.Cannon. Official Negligence: p. 43. King left the freeway near the Hansen Dam Recreation Area and the pursuit continued through residential streets at speeds ranging from , and through at least one red light. By this point, several police cars and a police helicopter had joined in the pursuit. After approximately , officers cornered King in his car. The first five Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers to arrive were Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseno, and Rolando Solano. =The beating= LAPD officers Officer Tim Singer ordered King and his two passengers to exit the vehicle and to lie face down on the ground. Allen claims he was manhandled, kicked, stomped, taunted, and threatened. Helms was hit in the head while lying on the ground; he was treated for a laceration on the top of his head. His bloody baseball cap was turned over to police. King remained in the car. When he emerged, he was reported to have giggled, to have patted the ground, and waved to the police helicopter overhead. King grabbed his buttocks, which Officer Melanie Singer took to mean King was reaching for a weapon,Cannon. Official Negligence: p. 27. though he was later found to be unarmed. She drew her pistol and pointed it at King, ordering him to lie on the ground. Singer approached, gun drawn, preparing to arrest him. At this point, Koon, the ranking officer at the scene, told Singer that the LAPD was taking command and ordered all officers to holster their weapons. According to the official report LAPD officer Koon ordered the four other LAPD officers at the scene‚ÄîBriseno, Powell, Solano, and Wind‚Äîto subdue and handcuff King using a technique called a \\"swarm,\\" where multiple officers grab a suspect with empty hands, to overcome potential resistance quickly. By standing to remove Officers Powell and Briseno from his back, the four officers claimed King had resisted attempts to restrain him. King denied he resisted. Witnesses also claimed King appeared not to resist. The officers later testified that they believed King was under the influence of phencyclidine (PCP),Cannon.

King is dragged on his abdomen to the side of the road to await the arrival of emergency medical rescue. Plumbing salesman and amateur videographer George Holliday's videotape of the beating was shot on his camcorder from his apartment near the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Osborne Street in Lake View Terrace. Two days later, Holliday called LAPD headquarters at Parker Center to let the police department know that he had a videotape of the incident. Still, he could not find anyone interested in seeing the video. He went to KTLA television with his recording. The station cut ten seconds of the video, before the image was in focus, that showed an extremely blurry shot of King rising to his feet and taking one step before being struck by one of the officers. Later, members of the jury said this cut footage was essential to their decision to acquit the officers, who had claimed this step represented the first of a charge at them. The footage as a whole became an instant media sensation. Portions were aired numerous times, and it \\"turned what would otherwise have been a violent, but soon forgotten, encounter between the Los Angeles police and an uncooperative suspect into one of the most widely watched and discussed incidents of its kind.\\" Several \\"copwatch\\" organizations subsequently were started throughout the United States to safeguard against police abuse, including an umbrella group, October 22 Coalition to Stop Police Brutality.PBS.org The ACLU draw connections between this event and the subsequent activities of many organizations designed to oversee police activities. Post-arrest events= Aftermath = King was taken to Pacifica Hospital after his arrest, where he was found to have suffered a fractured facial bone, a broken right ankle, and multiple bruises and lacerations.Cannon. Official Negligence: p. 205. In a negligence claim filed with the city, King alleged he had suffered \\"11 skull fractures, permanent brain damage, broken [bones and teeth], kidney failure [and] emotional and physical trauma\\". Blood and urine samples taken from King five hours after his arrest showed that he would have been intoxicated under California law at the time of his arrest. The tests also showed traces of marijuana (26 ng/ml). Pacifica Hospital nurses reported that the officers who accompanied King (including Wind) openly joked and bragged about the number of times they had hit King. Officers obtained King's identification from his clothes pockets at that time. King later sued the city for damages, and a jury awarded him $3.8 million, as well as $1.7 million in attorney's fees. The city did not pursue charges against King for driving while intoxicated and evading arrest. District Attorney Ira Reiner believed there was insufficient evidence for prosecution. His successor Gil Garcetti thought that by December 1992, too much time had passed to charge King with evading arrest; he also noted that the statute of limitations on drunk driving had passed. =Charges against police officers and trial= The Los Angeles County District Attorney subsequently charged four police officers, including one sergeant, with assault and use of excessive force. Due to the extensive media coverage of the arrest, the trial received a change of venue from Los Angeles County to Simi Valley in neighboring Ventura County. The jury was composed of ten whites, one bi-racial male, one Latino, and one Asian American. The prosecutor, Terry White, was black.Law.umkc.edu On April 29, 1992, the seventh day of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four officers of assault and acquitted three of the four of using excessive force. The jury could not agree on a verdict for the fourth officer charged with using excessive force. The verdicts were based in part on the first three seconds of a blurry, 13-second segment of the videotape that, according to journalist Lou Cannon, had not been aired by television news stations in their broadcasts. The first two seconds of videotape, contrary to the claims made by the accused officers, show King attempting to flee past Laurence Powell. During the next one minute and 19 seconds, King is beaten continuously by the officers. The officers testified that they tried to physically restrain King before the starting point of the videotape, but King was able to throw them off physically.The American edition of the National Geographic Channel aired the program \\"The Final Report: The LA Riots\\" on October 4, 2006 10 pm EDT, approximately 27 minutes into the hour (including commercial breaks). Afterward, the prosecution suggested that the jurors may have acquitted the officers because of becoming desensitized to the violence of the beating, as the defense played the videotape repeatedly in slow motion, breaking it down until its emotional impact was lost.Cannon, L. (2002). Official Negligence: How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and the LAPD. Basic Books. Outside the Simi Valley courthouse where the acquittals were delivered, county sheriff's deputies protected Stacey Koon from angry protesters on the way to his car. Movie director John Singleton, who was in the crowd at the courthouse, predicted, \\"By having this verdict, what these people did, they lit the fuse to a bomb.\\"CNN Documentary Race + Rage: The Beating of Rodney King, aired originally on March 5, 2011; approximately 14 minutes into the hour (not including commercial breaks). = Christopher Commission = Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley created the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, also known as the Christopher Commission, in April 1991. Led by attorney Warren Christopher, it was created to conduct \\"a full and fair examination of the structure and operation of the LAPD,\\" including its recruitment and training practices, internal disciplinary system, and citizen complaint system. Los Angeles riots and the aftermath Though few people at first considered race an essential factor in the case, including Rodney King's attorney, Steven Lerman, the Holliday videotape was at the time stirring deep resentment among black people in Los Angeles, as well as other major cities in the United States, where they had often complained of police abuse against their communities. The officers' jury consisted of Ventura County residents: ten white, one Latino, one Asian. Lead prosecutor Terry White was African American. On April 29, 1992, the jury acquitted three of the officers but could not agree on one of the charges against Powell. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said, \\"The jury's verdict will not blind us to what we saw on that videotape. The men who beat Rodney King do not deserve to wear the uniform of the LAPD.\\"Mydans, Seth (April 30, 1992). The videotape was largely thought to have helped inflame the riot. \\"The Police Verdict; Los Angeles Policemen Acquitted in Taped Beating \\". The New York Times. Retrieved December 1, 2009. President George H. W. Bush said, \\"Viewed from outside the trial, it was hard to understand how the verdict could possibly square with the video. Those civil rights leaders with whom I met were stunned. And so was I, and so was Barbara, and so were my kids.\\" Within hours of the acquittals, the 1992 Los Angeles riots began, lasting six days. African-Americans were outraged by the verdicts and began rioting in the streets along with the Latino communities. By the time law enforcement, the California Army National Guard, the United States Army, and the United States Marine Corps restored order, the riots had resulted in 63 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. Smaller riots occurred in other U.S. cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas in neighboring Nevada (see West Las Vegas riots), Seattle in Washington state, and as far east as Atlanta in Georgia and New York City. A minor riot erupted on Yonge Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as a result of the acquittals. During the riots, on May 1, 1992, King made a television appearance pleading for an end to the riots: > I just want to say ‚Äì you know ‚Äì can we all get along? Can we, can we get > along? Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids? And > ... I mean we've got enough smog in Los Angeles let alone to deal with > setting these fires and things ...

The widely quoted line has been often paraphrased as, \\"Can we all just get along?\\" or \\"Can't we all just get along?\\" Federal civil rights trial of officers After the acquittals and the riots, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) sought indictments of the police officers for violations of King's civil rights. On May 7, federal prosecutors began presenting evidence to the federal grand jury in Los Angeles. On August 4, the grand jury returned indictments against the three officers for \\"willfully and intentionally using unreasonable force\\" and against Sergeant Koon for \\"willfully permitting and failing to take action to stop the unlawful assault\\" on King. Based on these indictments, a trial of the four officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California began on February 25, 1993. The federal trial focused more on the incident. On March 9 of the 1993 trial, King took the witness stand and described to the jury the events as he remembered them. The jury found Officer Laurence Powell and Sergeant Stacey Koon guilty, and they were subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison. Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno were acquitted of all charges. During the three-hour sentencing hearing, US District Judge John G. Davies accepted much of the defense version of the beating. He strongly criticized King, who he said provoked the officers' initial actions. Davies said that only the final six or so baton blows by Powell were unlawful. The first 55 seconds of the videotaped portion of the incident, during which the vast majority of the blows were delivered, was within the law because the officers were attempting to subdue a suspect who was resisting efforts to take him into custody. Davies found that King's provocative behavior began with his \\"remarkable consumption of alcoholic beverage\\" and continued through a high-speed chase, refusal to submit to police orders and an aggressive charge toward Powell. Davies made several findings in support of the officers' version of events. He concluded that Officer Powell never intentionally struck King in the head, and \\"Powell's baton blow that broke King's leg was not illegal because King was still resisting and rolling around on the ground, and breaking bones in resistant suspects is permissible under police policy.\\" Mitigation cited by the judge in determining the length of the prison sentence included the suffering the officers had undergone because of the extensive publicity their case had received, high legal bills that were still unpaid, the impending loss of their careers as police officers, their higher risks of abuse while in prison, and their undergoing two trials. The judge acknowledged that the two trials did not legally constitute double jeopardy, but raised \\"the specter of unfairness.\\" These mitigations were critical to the validity of the sentences imposed because federal sentencing guidelines called for much longer prison terms in the range of 70 to 87 months. The low sentences were controversial and were appealed by the prosecution. In a 1994 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected all the grounds cited by Judge Davies and extended the terms. The defense appealed the case to the US Supreme Court. Both Koon and Powell were released from prison while they appealed to the Ninth Circuit's ruling, having served their original 30-month sentences with time off for good behavior. On June 14, 1996, the high court partially reversed the lower court in a ruling, unanimous in its most important aspects, which gave a strong endorsement to judicial discretion, even under sentencing guidelines intended to produce uniformity. Later life King with fianc√©e Cynthia Kelley in April 2012, two months before his death. Kelley was one of the jurors in King's civil suit against the city of Los Angeles when he was awarded $3.8 million. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered King $200,000 and a four-year college education funded by the city of Los Angeles. King refused and sued the city, winning $3.8 million. Bryant Allen, one of the passengers in King's car on the night of the incident, received $35,000 in his lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. The estate of Freddie Helms, the other passenger, settled for $20,000; Helms died in a car accident on June 29, 1991, age 20, in Pasadena. King invested a portion of his settlement in a record label, Straight Alta-Pazz Records, hoping to employ minority employees, but it went out of business. With help of a ghostwriter, he later wrote and published a memoir.Bates, K. G., \\"Rodney King Comes To Grips With 'The Riot Within'\\", NPR, April 23, 2012. King was subject to further arrests and convictions for driving violations after the 1991 incident, as he struggled with alcohol and drug addiction. On August 21, 1993, he crashed his car into a block wall in downtown Los Angeles. He was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, fined, and entered a rehabilitation program, after which he was placed on probation. In July 1995, he was arrested by Alhambra police after hitting his wife with his car and knocking her to the ground. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail after being convicted of hit and run. On August 27, 2003, King was arrested again for speeding and running a red light while under the influence of alcohol. He failed to yield to police officers and slammed his vehicle into a house, breaking his pelvis. On November 29, 2007, while riding home on his bicycle, King was shot in the face, arms, and back with pellets from a shotgun. He reported that the attackers were a man and a woman who demanded his bicycle and shot him when he rode away. Police described the wounds as looking as if they came from birdshot. In May 2008, King checked into the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California, where he filmed as a cast member of season 2 of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which premiered in October 2008. Dr. Drew Pinsky, who runs the facility, showed concern for King's life and said he would die unless his addictions were treated. King also appeared on Sober House, a Celebrity Rehab spin-off focusing on a sober living environment. During his time on Celebrity Rehab and Sober House, King worked on his addiction and what he said was lingering trauma of the beating. He and Pinsky physically retraced King's path from the night of his beating, eventually reaching the spot where it happened, the site of the Children's Museum of Los Angeles. In 2009, King and other Celebrity Rehab alumni appeared as panel speakers to a new group of addicts at the Pasadena Recovery Center, marking 11 months of sobriety for him. His appearance was aired in the third- season episode \\"Triggers\\". King won a celebrity boxing match against Chester, Pennsylvania police officer Simon Aouad on September 11, 2009, at the Ramada Philadelphia Airport in Essington. On September 9, 2010, it was confirmed that King was going to marry Cynthia Kelly, who had been a juror in the civil suit he brought against the City of Los Angeles. On March 3, 2011, the 20th anniversary of the beating, the LAPD stopped King for driving erratically and issued him a citation for driving with an expired license. This arrest led to a February 2012 misdemeanor conviction for reckless driving. The BBC quoted King commenting on his legacy. \\"Some people feel like I'm some kind of hero. Others hate me. They say I deserved it. Other people, I can hear them mocking me for when I called for an end to the destruction like I'm a fool for believing in peace.\\" Memoir In April 2012, King published his memoir, The Riot Within: My Journey from Rebellion to Redemption. Co-authored by Lawrence J. Spagnola, the book describes King's turbulent youth as well as his personal account of the arrest, the trials, and the aftermath. Death On Father's Day, June 17, 2012, King's partner, Cynthia Kelley, found King lying underwater at the bottom of his swimming pool. King died 28 years to the day after his father, Ronald King, was found dead in his bathtub in 1984. Police in Rialto received a 911 call from Kelley at about 5:25 a.m. (PDT). Responding officers removed King from the pool and performed CPR on him. Still pulseless, he was then transferred to an advanced life support ambulance where paramedics attempted to revive him. He was transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, California and was pronounced dead on arrival at 6:11 a.m. (PDT) The Rialto Police Department began a standard drowning investigation and said there did not appear to be any foul play. On August 23, 2012, King's autopsy results were released, stating he died of accidental drowning. The combination of alcohol, cocaine, and PCP found in his system were contributing factors, as were cardiomegaly and focal myocardial fibrosis. The conclusion of the report stated: \\"The effects of the drugs and alcohol, combined with the subject's heart condition, probably precipitated a cardiac arrhythmia, and the subject, incapacitated in the water, was unable to save himself.\\" Reverend Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy at King's funeral. King is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles County, California. Legacy Rodney King has become a symbol of police brutality, but his family remembers him as a \\"human, not a symbol.\\" King never advocated for hatred or violence against the police, pleading, \\"Can we all get along?\\" He made this his foundation for the rest of his life. Since his death, his daughter Lori King has worked with the LAPD to build bridges between the police and the African-American community. She also started a nonprofit: The Rodney King Foundation for Social Justice and Human Rights, on behalf of her father.  In popular culture  The beating of Rodney King and its aftermath has been addressed frequently in art, including the 1997 film Riot; the Sublime song \\"April 29, 1992 (Miami)\\"; an extended discussion on the subject led by Edward Norton in the 1998 film American History X; the 2014 one-man play Rodney King by Roger Guenveur Smith, produced by Spike Lee and released on Netflix in 2017; and the 2016 exhibit Viral: 25 Years from Rodney King. Lee included a snippet of the Rodney King video in his 1992 film Malcolm X. Morgan Freeman and Lori McCreary will be producing a docuseries through their company Revelations Entertainment on the life of Rodney King, to be released in 2018.\\"Rodney King family footage\\", Variety, 2017. The beating was also briefly mentioned in The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story and Law & Order True Crime where Rodney King's case is referenced as the main reason for the outcome of the cases these two anthology miniseries are based on. The beating of King and the riots that followed were also mentioned in the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about the rap group NWA the beating was also depicted in an episode of the TV show 9-1-1. The 2017 film Kings takes place in South Los Angeles during the riots. The 1999 documentary film The Rodney King Incident: Race and Justice in America produced and directed by Michael Pack features an interview with Rodney King. Also mentioned in the 2003 American crime thriller Dark Blue starring Kurt Russell. Neighbor Nahshon Dion Anderson observed the beating and recounted the details in a memoir Shooting Range. The 1999 album The Battle of Los Angeles by Rage Against the Machine also refers to the riot which followed King's assault. The 1997 song \\"Walkin' on the Sun\\" by Smash Mouth was written about the riots that followed King's assault.https://genius.com/Smash-mouth- walkin-on-the-sun-lyrics See also * History of African Americans in Los Angeles References *  Citations  Further reading  * King's autobiography. * External links * Rodney King: Video of Arrest (March 3, 1991) and FBI Case Files in the Rodney King Archive at FBI Records: The Vault (Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Archive)  Rodney King's Arrest Record * Rodney King: 17 Years After the Riots\\", Laist.com * Kavanagh, Jim. \\"Rodney King, 20 years later\\".

In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non- empty trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices. A directed cycle in a directed graph is a non-empty directed trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices. A graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph. A directed graph without directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph. A connected graph without cycles is called a tree.  Definitions = Circuit, cycle = * A circuit is a non- empty trail in which the first vertex is equal to the last vertex (closed trail). : Let be a graph.

A directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail with a vertex sequence . * A directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex.  Chordless cycles  In this graph the green cycle (A-B-C-D-E-F-A) is chordless whereas the red cycle (G-H-I-J-K-L-G) is not. This is because the edge K-I is a chord. A chordless cycle in a graph, also called a hole or an induced cycle, is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle. An antihole is the complement of a graph hole. Chordless cycles may be used to characterize perfect graphs: by the strong perfect graph theorem, a graph is perfect if and only if none of its holes or antiholes have an odd number of vertices that is greater than three. A chordal graph, a special type of perfect graph, has no holes of any size greater than three. The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle; this cycle is necessarily chordless. Cages are defined as the smallest regular graphs with given combinations of degree and girth. A peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle. In a graph that is not formed by adding one edge to a cycle, a peripheral cycle must be an induced cycle.  Cycle space  The term cycle may also refer to an element of the cycle space of a graph. There are many cycle spaces, one for each coefficient field or ring. The most common is the binary cycle space (usually called simply the cycle space), which consists of the edge sets that have even degree at every vertex; it forms a vector space over the two-element field. By Veblen's theorem, every element of the cycle space may be formed as an edge-disjoint union of simple cycles. A cycle basis of the graph is a set of simple cycles that forms a basis of the cycle space.. Using ideas from algebraic topology, the binary cycle space generalizes to vector spaces or modules over other rings such as the integers, rational or real numbers, etc..  Cycle detection  The existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined by whether depth-first search (DFS) finds an edge that points to an ancestor of the current vertex (it contains a back edge).All the back edges which DFS skips over are part of cycles. In an undirected graph, the edge to the parent of a node should not be counted as a back edge, but finding any other already visited vertex will indicate a back edge. In the case of undirected graphs, only O(n) time is required to find a cycle in an n-vertex graph, since at most n ‚àí 1 edges can be tree edges. Many topological sorting algorithms will detect cycles too, since those are obstacles for topological order to exist. Also, if a directed graph has been divided into strongly connected components, cycles only exist within the components and not between them, since cycles are strongly connected. For directed graphs, distributed message based algorithms can be used. These algorithms rely on the idea that a message sent by a vertex in a cycle will come back to itself. Distributed cycle detection algorithms are useful for processing large-scale graphs using a distributed graph processing system on a computer cluster (or supercomputer). Applications of cycle detection include the use of wait-for graphs to detect deadlocks in concurrent systems.  Covering graphs by cycles  In his 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg, widely considered to be the birth of graph theory, Leonhard Euler proved that, for a finite undirected graph to have a closed walk that visits each edge exactly once, it is necessary and sufficient that it be connected except for isolated vertices (that is, all edges are contained in one component) and have even degree at each vertex. The corresponding characterization for the existence of a closed walk visiting each edge exactly once in a directed graph is that the graph be strongly connected and have equal numbers of incoming and outgoing edges at each vertex. In either case, the resulting walk is known as an Euler cycle or Euler tour. If a finite undirected graph has even degree at each of its vertices, regardless of whether it is connected, then it is possible to find a set of simple cycles that together cover each edge exactly once: this is Veblen's theorem.. When a connected graph does not meet the conditions of Euler's theorem, a closed walk of minimum length covering each edge at least once can nevertheless be found in polynomial time by solving the route inspection problem. The problem of finding a single simple cycle that covers each vertex exactly once, rather than covering the edges, is much harder. Such a cycle is known as a Hamiltonian cycle, and determining whether it exists is NP-complete.. Much research has been published concerning classes of graphs that can be guaranteed to contain Hamiltonian cycles; one example is Ore's theorem that a Hamiltonian cycle can always be found in a graph for which every non-adjacent pair of vertices have degrees summing to at least the total number of vertices in the graph.. The cycle double cover conjecture states that, for every bridgeless graph, there exists a multiset of simple cycles that covers each edge of the graph exactly twice. Proving that this is true (or finding a counterexample) remains an open problem...  Graph classes defined by cycles  Several important classes of graphs can be defined by or characterized by their cycles. These include: * Bipartite graph, a graph without odd cycles (cycles with an odd number of vertices). * Cactus graph, a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle * Cycle graph, a graph that consists of a single cycle. * Chordal graph, a graph in which every induced cycle is a triangle * Directed acyclic graph, a directed graph with no cycles * Line perfect graph, a graph in which every odd cycle is a triangle * Perfect graph, a graph with no induced cycles or their complements of odd length greater than three * Pseudoforest, a graph in which each connected component has at most one cycle * Strangulated graph, a graph in which every peripheral cycle is a triangle * Strongly connected graph, a directed graph in which every edge is part of a cycle * Triangle-free graph, a graph without three- vertex cycles  See also  * Cycle space * Cycle basis * Cycle detection in a sequence of iterated function values  References  Category:Graph theory objects ","title":"Cycle (graph theory)"},{"id":"168613","text":"Morphine was an American alternative rock group formed by Mark Sandman, Dana Colley, and Jerome Deupree in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1989. After five successful albums and extensive touring, they disbanded after lead vocalist Sandman died of a heart attack onstage in Palestrina, Italy, on July 3, 1999. Founding members have reformed into the band Vapors of Morphine, maintaining much of the original style and sound. Morphine combined blues and jazz elements with more traditional rock arrangements, giving the band an unusual sound. Sandman sang distinctively in a \\"deep, laid-back croon\\", and his songwriting featured a prominent beat influence. The band themselves coined the label \\"low rock\\" to describe their music, which involved \\"a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a 'power trio' not built around the sound of an electric guitar. Instead, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album.\\" The band enjoyed positive critical appraisal, but met with mixed results commercially. In the United States the band was embraced and promoted by the indie rock community, including public and college radio stations and MTV's 120 Minutes, which the band once guest- hosted, but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs. This limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country, while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success, especially in Belgium, Russia, Portugal, France and Australia. History=Formation, independent years (1989‚Äì1996)= Morphine was formed in 1989 by bassist and vocalist Mark Sandman, a member of the bluesy alternative rock band Treat Her Right, saxophonist Dana Colley, a former member of the local Boston group Three Colors, and drummer Jerome Deupree, who had played with Sandman in the Hypnosonics. Sandman, a prolific musician who frequently experimented with home-made instruments, played a single-stringed bass guitar of his own devising with a slide, although he later added a second string. Deupree briefly left the group for health reasons in 1991 and was temporarily replaced by Treat Her Right drummer Billy Conway. These years found the group building a strong local audience and touring occasionally. With Deupree returning, they recorded their debut album, Good, for the Boston-based Accurate/Distortion label in 1991. The album received positive reviews and increased the band's audience. The band subsequently signed to Rykodisc, who re-released Good under its own imprint. Cure for Pain, 1993's followup, increased the band's audience outside of New England, and singles like \\"Thursday\\" and \\"Buena\\" picked up some college radio play. During the recording of Cure for Pain, Deupree was again replaced by Conway, although Deupree still played most of the percussion work on the album. After the album was completed, the band toured the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. In 1994, the songs \\"Sheila\\" and \\"In Spite of Me\\" were prominently featured on the soundtrack of the film Spanking the Monkey. The band returned to the studio in 1995 and produced Yes. The album featured the single \\"Honey White,\\" the music video for which appeared on the MTV animated series Beavis and Butt-head. It also included \\"I Had My Chance,\\" which was featured on the soundtrack for the film Get Shorty. =DreamWorks Records years (1997‚Äì1999)= After two years of touring, Morphine signed with DreamWorks Records, who released their major label debut, Like Swimming, in 1997. It was a critical success, but did not break the band into the domestic mainstream as had been hoped. DreamWorks released a music video for the single \\"Early to Bed\\"; directed by Jamie Caliri and released in March 1997, the nightmarish yet humorous video became an instant favorite among fans and was later nominated for a Grammy award. The band also released B-Sides and Otherwise, a collection of B-sides and live recordings, on Rykodisc this same year. In the following time, Deupree once again began performing live and in the studio with the band, making the group a four-piece. The band's final studio album, The Night, was completed in early 1999. On July 3, 1999, Sandman collapsed on the stage of the Nel Nome del Rock festival at the Giardini del Principe in Palestrina, Italy, outside of Rome. He was soon pronounced dead of a heart attack and Morphine immediately disbanded. The Night was released in 2000. Posthumous Morphine releases followed shortly thereafter, including Bootleg Detroit, an \\"official live bootleg\\", and The Best of Morphine: 1992‚Äì1995, both on Rykodisc. =Posthumous projects (1999‚Äìpresent)= Dana Colley performing with the posthumous Members of Morphine project in 2011 Within a year of Sandman's death, Colley and Conway created Orchestra Morphine, a group of Sandman's friends and colleagues who toured to celebrate the music of the band and to raise funds for the Mark Sandman Music Education Fund. Orchestra Morphine mostly performed music from The Night, but also included some other Morphine and Hypnosonics material as well. Orchestra Morphine still performs occasionally but no longer tours. Singer and guitarist Laurie Sargent, a member of Orchestra Morphine and former vocalist for the band Face to Face, later joined Colley and Conway in their first post-Morphine musical endeavor, Twinemen. Conway and Colley also officially formed the Hi-n-Dry independent record label and studio, converting Sandman's workspace into a commercial enterprise. The label's roster includes a number of their friends, colleagues and other Boston-area musicians. In 2004, Hi-n-Dry released the Mark Sandman box set Sandbox, which contained two CDs and a DVD of previously unreleased material spanning Sandman's musical career. The DVD featured clips from early Sandman shows, interviews from the Morphine tours, and various videos from other Sandman solo and group projects, such as Treat Her Right. However, for copyright reasons the box set did not contain any previously released material found in the Morphine catalog, Morphine videos, or promotional material produced by Rykodisc or DreamWorks Records. Deupree continued to record with various jazz musicians. In 2009, Colley and Deupree began regularly performing Morphine songs and new material as Members of Morphine (alternately, the Ever-Expanding Elastic Waste Band), with singer, bassist and guitarist Jeremy Lyons of New Orleans. In July 2009, the group played at Nel Nome Del Rock Festival in Palestrina, Italy, marking the ten-year anniversary of Sandman's death at the location in which it occurred. As of 2014, the group was renamed Vapors of Morphine and regularly performs in Boston and New Orleans, and holds a standing weekly gig at Atwood's Tavern in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

They are widely regarded as pioneers of industrial music. Evolving from the experimental performance art group COUM Transmissions, Throbbing Gristle made their public debut in October 1976 on COUM exhibition Prostitution, and released their debut single \\"United/Zyklon B Zombie\\" and debut album The Second Annual Report the following year. The band released several subsequent studio and live albums‚Äîincluding D.o.A: The Third and Final Report of Throbbing Gristle (1978), 20 Jazz Funk Greats (1979), and Heathen Earth (1980)‚Äîon their own record label Industrial Records, building a reputation with their transgressive and confrontational aesthetics; they included the extensive use of disturbing visual imagery (such as fascist and Nazi symbolism and pornography), as well as that of sound manipulation (noise and pre-recorded tape-based samples) influenced by works of William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin. Throbbing Gristle dissolved in 1981 due to interpersonal differences; the individual members went on to participate in other projects, such as Psychic TV, Coil, and Chris & Cosey. The band was reformed in 2004, and released three more studio albums‚ÄîTG Now (2004), Part Two (2007), and The Third Mind Movements (2009)‚Äîbefore disbanding again after P-Orridge's departure and Christopherson's death in Autumn 2010. P-Orridge later died in March 2020. The band's final studio project, a cover version of the 1970 Nico album Desertshore titled The Desertshore Installation, was released in 2012 under the moniker X-TG.  History = First era: 1976‚Äì1981 = Throbbing Gristle evolved from the performance art group COUM Transmissions, formed in Kingston upon Hull by a group of performers centred on Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. The last known performance of COUM Transmissions‚ÄîProstitution, an exhibition held in October 1976 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts‚Äîwas also the public debut of Throbbing Gristle.; Throbbing Gristle's confrontational live performances and use of often disturbing imagery, including pornography and photographs of Nazi concentration camps, gave the group a reputation as notorious. The group always maintained that their mission was to challenge and explore the darker and obsessive sides of the human condition rather than to make attractive music. Throbbing Gristle made extensive use of pre-recorded tape-based samples and special effects to produce a distinctive, highly distorted background, usually accompanied by lyrics or spoken-word performances by Cosey Fanni Tutti or Genesis P-Orridge. Though they asserted they wanted to provoke their audience into thinking for themselves rather than pushing any specific agenda (as evidenced by the song \\"Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think\\" on Heathen Earth), Throbbing Gristle frequently associated with the anarchist punk scene. They appeared in the fanzine Toxic Grafity, with a condensation of their own propaganda parody series, Industrial News. In 1977, they released their debut single \\"United / Zyklon B Zombie\\", followed by the album The Second Annual Report. Although pressed in a limited initial run of 786 copies on the band's Industrial Records label, it was re-released on Mute Records due to high demand; however, this later release was reversed with all tracks playing backwards and in reverse order. This was followed by a series of albums, singles and live performances over a four-year period. In 1981, Michael Sheppard, concert promoter and founder of Transparency Record label brought Throbbing Gristle to Los Angeles. On 29 May 1981, Throbbing Gristle performed at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco in what turned out the group's last performance until 2004; Throbbing Gristle announced their dissolution on 23 June 1981, mailing out postcards declaring that their \\"mission is terminated\\". In a 1987 interview, Cosey Fanni Tutti attributed the band's split to that between her and P-Orridge saying, \\"TG broke up because me and Gen broke up\\". Genesis P-Orridge and Peter Christopherson went on to form Psychic TV, and Cosey Fanni Tutti and Carter continued to record together under the names of Chris and Cosey, Carter Tutti and Creative Technology Institute. Christopherson participated in Psychic TV's first releases, and later joined John Balance in the latter project Coil. Meanwhile, Gen (now known as Genesis Breyer P-Orridge) subsequently formed Thee Majesty and PTV3 with the help of his wife Jacqueline \\"Jaye\\" Breyer. = Second era: 2004‚Äì2010 = In 2004, Throbbing Gristle briefly reunited to record and release the limited album TG Now. On 2 April 2007, TG released the album Part Two, which the group had finished recording in Berlin. It was originally set to be released by Mute Records in September 2006 but was delayed for unknown reasons. In March 2007, Side-Line announced Part Two's final release date, adding that a string of special live events would take place in 2007. A seven- disc DVD set, titled TGV, was issued in 2007. The set contains old and new footage of the band. TGV came packaged in a deluxe box with a 64-page book, all designed by Christopherson. The group performed a re-interpretation of their debut album The Second Annual Report twice in 2008 to mark 30 years since its original release. The performance in Paris on 6 June was issued as a limited edition framed vinyl set titled The Thirty-Second Annual Report, limited to 777 copies (as the group claim the original was, but other sources claim that there were 785). Throbbing Gristle worked to record an album based on their interpretation of Nico's album Desertshore. The group issued the entirety of the recording sessions for this album as a limited edition twelve- CD set packaged in a custom CD wallet, The Desertshore Installation, which sold out via mail order from the group's website. In April 2009, Throbbing Gristle toured the United States, appearing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago. The Third Mind Movements, a new release was made available at these shows, was edited from jams recorded during the Desertshore sessions. A collaboration with Cerith Wyn Evans titled A=P=P=A=R=I=T=I=O=N was displayed at Tramway, Glasgow from the 7 August to 27 September 2009. Throbbing Gristle contributed a multi-channel soundtrack that was played through sixteen hanging Audio Spotlight sound panels that Evans had incorporated into his sculpture. In November 2009, Throbbing Gristle and Industrial Records released their version of the Buddha Machine titled Gristleism. It was designed by Throbbing Gristle and Christiaan Virant based on FM3's design. Gristleism offers more loops and almost twice the frequency range of the Buddha Machine. The player comes in three colours: black, chrome and red. On 29 October 2010, Throbbing Gristle announced on their website that Genesis P-Orridge had informed them that she was no longer willing to perform with Throbbing Gristle and would be returning to her home in New York. Chris, Cosey and Christopherson finished the tour under the name X-TG. P-Orridge's website stated that she had not quit Throbbing Gristle and had just stopped participating on the current tour; it also said that an explanation would be released when all things were cleared up. However, on 24 November 2010, Christopherson died in his sleep at the age of 55, and the band subsequently dissolved. = Third era: 2011‚Äìpresent = In 2011, Industrial Records had an official \\"re-activation\\", as TG's contract with Mute Records had expired. Because TG has disbanded following the death of Christopherson, the label's plan is to re-release the original TG albums (The Second Annual Report, D.o.A: The Third and Final Report, 20 Jazz Funk Greats, Heathen Earth and Greatest Hits) on the label. Originally intended to be released on 26 September 2011, they had to delay due to a Sony DADC warehouse fire in London. The plan changed to issue each album chronologically once per week starting on Halloween 2011 with The Second Annual Report and ending 28 November with Greatest Hits. Industrial Records announced that a double album, titled Desertshore/The Final Report, would be released on 26 November 2012. Chris and Cosey produced the album, with the participation of guest vocalists Anohni (from Antony and the Johnsons), Blixa Bargeld (from Einst√ºrzende Neubauten), Marc Almond (from Soft Cell), film director Gaspar No√© and former pornography star Sasha Grey. A group decision had been made before Christopherson's death that the album would be recorded afresh because they were not satisfied with the ICA recordings. Christopherson had been the driving force behind the project and had been working on the record in Bangkok with Danny Hyde, even getting custom instruments made to use for the album. \\"It was Sleazy's project, then Cosey and Sleazy's, then I came in on it\\", Carter explained in an interview with The Quietus. After Christopherson died, the Desertshore instruments were given to Carter and Cosey, and they began combining the recordings he had been making with the work they had done themselves. They announced plans to debut the album live at AV Festival on 17 March 2012 accompanied by a screening of Philippe Garrel's film The Inner Scar \\"for which Desertshore was the soundtrack and inspiration\\". On 14 March 2020, P-Orridge died.  Legacy  The band is widely viewed as having created the industrial music genre, along with contemporaries Cabaret Voltaire. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album The Second Annual Report, they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". The first wave of this music appeared with Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire.RE/Search #6/7, p. 42‚Äì49. Wreckers of Civilization, a survey on COUM Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle's original run written by Simon Ford, was published in 1999; its title is a reference to the Prostitution exhibition controversy.

Life and career=1971‚Äì1981: Early life and career beginnings= Paulina Susana Rubio Dosamantes was born on 17 June 1971 in Mexico City, Mexico. Her father, Enrique Rubio Gonz√°lez (1943-2011), was a Spanish-born lawyer; Her mother is Susana Dosamantes, a consecrated Mexican actress. Dosamantes had lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco until adolescence when she decided to become a film actress and, just before Rubio's birth, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1970s in Mexico. Rubio's younger brother, Enrique Rubio Jr., is an important lawyer and socialite, while her half sister Ana Paola Rubio who keeping out of the spotlight. Her musical legacy comes from his grandmother and great-grandmother, who were a mezzo-soprano singer and pianist, respectively. As Rubio has stated of herself \\"I have been famous since I was born\\" and according to her mother, Rubio grew up among the filming locations while she worked. A ten-year-old, accompanied by younger brother Enrique Jr. they got a minor role in film El D√≠a del Compadre (1983), filmed in early 1980s. Rubio was taking singing, acting, jazz, painting, and dance lessons while enrolled at what is now the Centro de Educaci√≥n Art√≠stica (CEA) in Mexico. After two years there, Rubio's parents were contacted by Julisa and Guillermo del Bosque for approval of Rubio's joining a band that would be formed by children from the center. =1982‚Äì1991: Timbiriche era and first telenovela= The Spanish singer Miguel Bos√© was Timbiriche's official godfather. The name of musical group Timbiriche was inspired by a table game known in the United States as Dots and Boxes. The idea of naming the musical group comes in response to the Spanish children's musical group Parch√≠s. Timbiriche was created by Victor Hugo O'Farril, Luis de Llano Macedo and Mar√≠a Eugenia \\"La Gorda\\" Galindo. Rubio began her singing career Timbiriche made its official debut on 30 April 1982 on the Mexican television show Siempre en Domingo, featuring Spanish singer Miguel Bos√© as its godfather. The original band had seven members: Alix Bauer, Benny Ibarra, Diego Schoening, Mariana Garza, Paulina Rubio, Sasha S√∂kol, and Erik Rub√≠n (who joined a year later). After the success of his first homonymous albums, Timbiriche and La Banda Timbiriche, both from 1982, the following year he released a live album that led the group to recognition throughout Latin America. En Concierto was also a hit with hits covers by Anglo-Saxon artists, including \\"Mickey\\" by Toni Basil that the group reinterpreted in Spanish dedicated especially to Miguel Bos√© as a way of thanking him for his sponsorship. In 1984, Timbiriche participated in the musical Vaselina (Spanish adaptation of the American musical Grease) and edit the album Timbiriche Vaselina. At that time the group began to internationalize in Latin America with hits such as \\"Soy Un Desastre\\", \\"Corro, Vuelo, Me Acelero\\", \\"Tel√©fono\\" and \\"Me Plant√≥\\" that were consecrated as their first number one singles hits in Mexico. The singles mentioned belonged to the album Timbiriche Rock Show which received platinum disc for 500,000 copies sold. Also, new members join Timbiriche as Eduardo Capetillo, Thal√≠a and Edith M√°rquez. Timbiriche's musical evolution took a turn \\"from children to teenagers\\" and is reflected in the hit albums Timbiriche VII and Timbiriche VIII & IX that sold 800,000 and 500,000 copies in Mexico, respectively. These albums are considered Timbiriche's greatest commercial achievements and have been included in the best-selling albums in Latin America. At that time, Rubio began to excel as one of the most notorious members and her voice excels in songs such as \\"Rompecabezas\\", \\"Persecuci√≥n en la Ciudad\\", \\"Acelerar\\" and \\"Me Estoy Volviendo Loca\\". At the same time of developing as a singer, Rubio begins to receive other proposals in the artistic field and she landed her first role in 1988 as the villain Paulina Montenegro in the telenovela Pasi√≥n y Poder. The tenth and last album that Paulina Rubio recorded as a member of Timbiriche was released in 1990 (Timbiriche X) and despite the fact that she was already the leader of the group, in 1991 Rubio left Timbiriche to focus on a solo career, and moved to Spain to begin work on her first album. =1992‚Äì1994: La Chica Dorada and 24 Kilates= In early 1992, Rubio participated in the soap opera Baila Conmigo, based in the late 50s and early 60s at the time of Rock and Roll. She played the role of Andrea de la Reguera, a rich and capricious girl who was used to having everything at her disposal. Her leading role as an antagonist turned out to be very convincing to the press and audience, earning positive reviews for her performance. The soap opera producer was Luis de Llano, who recruited a cast of youth stars who were just beginning their solo career in music and acting. and gave continuity to the genre of youth musical telenovelas. The success of Baila Conmigo gave the protagonists the possibility of recording a special album and received 9 nominations for the 1993 TVyNovelas Awards, including \\"Actress Revelation\\" for Rubio, but lost to Yolanda Andrade. Also a soundtrack was released under the Fonovisa Records label of ten songs in some Latin American countries. Rubio along with the cast of the telenovela appeared in different television shows to promote the album. This was a boost and enrichment for Paulina Rubio's career as a solo artist and part of the concept of her debut album is influenced by the same concept of the soap opera. Rubio traveled to Spain to record the songs of what would be her first solo album. These recording studio sessions ran from December 1991 to February 1992. After her returned to Mexico, she embarked on a promotional campaign to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a six-song set and she was accompanied by back-up dancers. In June 1992, Rubio signed to a recording contract with Capitol Latin. Her first single, \\"M√≠o\\", spent several weeks at number one on the Mexican singles charts and became one of the country's highest-selling single in the 1990s and was certified gold. In United States \\"M√≠o\\" reached number three on the Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks chart. Its success resulted in Rubio becoming Timbiriche's first solo singer to enter Billboard charts with great success and repeated the formula at the release of her debut album La Chica Dorada, who released in October 1992 and peak at number three on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart on the week of 26 June 1993. Three days before the official release of the album, Rubio appeared on the legendary TV show Siempre en Domingo with Ra√∫l Velasco to publicize his new stage in the music industry. The famous television host commented that \\"it was a great privilege to have presented Paulina as a solo singer\\". At the beginning of her solo career, the press and critics were very hard on Paulina Rubio, and many pronounced her as an \\"Madonna wannabe\\" due to the great influence of the young artist with the American entertainer, but with the success from their first single and the album sales, the tabloids considered it as the new youth pop icon in Mexico. In 1993, she released her sophomore effort, 24 Kilates, which sold 150,000 copies in two weeks of its release. The album peaked at No. 1 in Mexico. \\"Nieva, Nieva\\" was released as the first single which reached No. 27 on the Hot Latin Tracks and became Paulina's first No. 1 single in Mexico. \\"√âl Me Enga√±√≥\\" and \\"Asunto de Dos\\" were released in Mexico and peaked at No. 1 and No. 5 respectively. The same year, Rubio received two nominations for the 1993 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards for the categories Female Pop Artist and New Pop Artist of the Year. =1995‚Äì1999: El Tiempo Es Oro and Planeta Paulina= In 1995, El Tiempo Es Oro was released. It included the hits \\"Te Dar√≠a Mi Vida\\" and \\"Nada de Ti\\" which peaked at number one in Mexico while \\"Hoy Te Dej√© De Amar\\" peaked at number nine. Also included on the album was the theme song and title-track to the 1994 Mexican film B√©same En La Boca, in which she also starred as the lead role. In 1996, she released her last album under EMI Latin, Planeta Paulina, which included the hit single \\"Enamorada\\" which peaked at No. 2 in Mexico. \\"Pobre Ni√±a Rica\\" was featured as the theme song of the 1995 telenovela in which she also starred as Alma, Pobre Ni√±a Rica. Rubio also recorded English versions of several songs which did not appear on the album. Some of these songs were released years later on the hits compilation I'm So in Love: Grandes √âxitos. The first single off the album \\"Siempre Tuya Desde La Ra√≠z\\" peaked at No. 1 in Mexico while \\"S√≥lo Por Ti\\" peaked at #7. EMI declined to release Paulina's first English crossover album, which was supposed to be the English version of the Planeta Paulina album due to weak sales of the Spanish version. Because of that, Rubio got in a legal battle against EMI for not fulfilling what they had already planned. She eventually had to pay money so EMI could let her leave the record company. After the release of Planeta Paulina, Rubio took a break on her career. Except for her participation in 1998's successful Reencuentro Tour with Timbiriche, Rubio was absent from the music scene for nearly four years. =2000‚Äì2002: Paulina and Border Girl= Paulina Rubio in July 2000 Paulina's return to the music scene began in the summer of 1999 when she recorded Richard Daniel Roman's \\"Vive El Verano\\", the theme song to a summer TV show where she was the host of in Spain. On 23 May 2000, Rubio released her fifth album, Paulina, her first release under Universal Music Latino; she was given complete control over the album. It was nominated three times at the second annual Latin Grammy Awards for \\"Album of the Year\\", \\"Song of the Year\\", and \\"Best Female Pop Vocal Album\\"; she became the winner of multiple prestigious awards. It became Rubio's first number-one album on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart, and number 156 on the US Billboard 200, and was on the charts for more than two years. Paulina was the best selling Latin album in the United States in 2001, selling over 1 million copies in the US alone. Paulina has sold more than 2 million copies. The album's singles, \\"Lo Har√© Por Ti\\", \\"El √öltimo Adi√≥s\\", \\"Y Yo Sigo Aqu√≠\\", and \\"Yo No Soy Esa Mujer\\", peaked at numbers 13, 18, three and seven respectively on Billboards Hot Latin Tracks chart. Other releases include \\"Sexi Dance\\" and \\"Tal Vez, Quiz√°\\" which peaked at numbers thirty-four and forty-two on the same chart. All singles have peaked inside the top ten in Mexico.

The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and his one-time wife Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, The White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single \\"Seven Nation Army\\", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the iconic opening riff, became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, Get Behind Me Satan in 2005 and Icky Thump in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording. The White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black‚Äîwhich was used on every album and single cover the band released‚Äîas well as the band's fascination with the number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, two live albums, one extended play (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 2015, they were ranked No. 6 on Rolling Stone's list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

In 1997‚Äîallegedly on Bastille Day‚ÄîMeg first began to learn to play the drums. In Jack's words, \\"When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing.

The self-titled debut was produced by Jack and engineered by Jim Diamond at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. The album was dedicated to the seminal Mississippi Delta blues musician, Son House‚Äîan artist who greatly influenced Jack. The track \\"Cannon\\" from The White Stripes contains part of an a cappella version, as performed by House, of the traditional American gospel blues song \\"John the Revelator\\". The White Stripes also covered House's song \\"Death Letter\\" on their follow-up album De Stijl. Looking back on their debut during a 2003 interview with Guitar Player, Jack said, \\"I still feel we've never topped our first album. It's the most raw, the most powerful, and the most Detroit-sounding record we've made.\\"Fox, Darrin, \\"White Heat\\", Guitar Player, June 2003, p. 66 Allmusic said of the album: > Jack White's voice is a singular, evocative combination of punk, metal, > blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just > enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances > out the fretwork and the fretting with methodical, spare, and booming > cymbal, bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer- > songwriting duos should sound this good. At the end of 1999, The White Stripes released \\"Hand Springs\\" as a 7\\" split single with fellow Detroit band the Dirtbombs on the B-side. 2,000 copies came free with the pinball fanzine Multiball. The record is currently‚Äîlike the majority of vinyl records by The White Stripes‚Äîout of print and difficult to find. =De Stijl (2000)= White Stripes in the back room of Club Shinjuku Jam, Tokyo, to an audience of 10‚Äì20 people, in their first Japanese tour. Jack and Meg divorced in March 2000. The White Stripes were scheduled to perform at a local music lounge soon after they separated. Jack assumed the band was over and asked Buick and nephew Ben Blackwell to perform with him in the slot that had been booked for The White Stripes. However, the day they were supposed to perform, Meg convinced Jack that The White Stripes should continue and the band reunited. The White Stripes' second album, De Stijl (Dutch for \\"The Style\\"), was released on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label on June 20, 2000. Considered a cult classic and self-recorded on an 8-track analog tape in Jack's living room, De Stijl displays the simplicity of the band's blues and \\"scuzzy garage rock\\" fusion prior to their breakthrough success. The album title derives from the Dutch art movement of the same name;Eliscu, Jenny (February 15, 2001) \\"THE WHITE STRIPES\\". Rolling Stone. 862:65 common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white. The White Stripes have cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design as a source of inspiration for their own musical image and presentation. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, as well as to the influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell. Party of Special Things to Do was released as a 7\\" on Sub Pop in December 2000. It comprised three songs originally performed by Captain Beefheart, an experimental blues rock musician. De Stijl eventually reached number 38 on Billboard Magazine's Independent Albums chart in 2002, around the time The White Stripes' popularity began establishing itself. One New York Times critic at the time said that the Stripes typified \\"what many hip rock fans consider real music.\\" The song \\"Why Can't You Be Nicer to Me?\\" was used in The Simpsons episode \\"Judge Me Tender\\". =White Blood Cells (2001)= The White Stripes' third album, White Blood Cells, was released on July 3, 2001 on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The band enjoyed its first significant success the following year with the major label re-release of the album on V2 Records. Its stripped- down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK, and in the US soon afterward, making The White Stripes one of the most acclaimed bands of 2002. Several outlets praised their \\"back to basics\\" approach, with Daily Mirror calling them \\"the greatest band since The Sex Pistols.\\" In 2002, Q magazine listed The White Stripes as one of \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\". After their first appearance on network TV (a live set on The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn), Joe Hagan of the New York Times declared, \\"They have made rock rock again by returning to its origins as a simple, primitive sound full of unfettered zeal.\\" White Blood Cells peaked at number 61 on the Billboard 200, reaching Gold record status by selling over 500,000 albums. It reached number 55 in the United Kingdom, being bolstered in both countries by the single \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" and its accompanying Lego-animation music video directed by Michel Gondry. The video won three awards at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards: Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects, and Best Editing, and the band played the song live at the event.Klosterman, Chuck (Oct 2002). \\"The Garage\\", Spin. 18 (10):64‚Äì68 It was also nominated for Video of the Year, but fell short of winning. Stylus Magazine rated White Blood Cells as the fourteenth greatest album of 2000‚Äì2005, while Pitchfork Media ranked it eighth on their list of the top 100 albums from 2000 to 2004. In 2002, George Roca produced and directed a concert film about the band titled Nobody Knows How to Talk to Children. It chronicles The White Stripes' four-night stand at New York City's Bowery Ballroom in 2002, and contains live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band's management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission. According to the band, the film was \\"not up to the standards our fans have come to expect\\"; even so, it remains a highly prized bootleg. =Elephant (2003)= The White Stripes' fourth album, Elephant, was recorded in 2002 over the span of two weeks with British recording engineer Liam Watson at his Toe Rag Studios in London.Fricke, David (April 17, 2003), \\"Living Color\\" . Rolling Stone. (920): 102 Jack self-produced the album with antiquated equipment, including a duct- taped 8-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear. It was released in 2003 on V2 in the US, and on XL Recordings in England. It marked the band's major label debut and was their first UK chart-topping album, as well as their first US Top 10 album (at number six). The album eventually reached double platinum certification in Britain, and platinum certification in the United States.RIAA Recording Industry Association of America. Elephant garnered much critical acclaim upon its release. It received a perfect five-out-of-five-star rating from Rolling Stone magazine, and enjoys a 92-percent positive rating on Metacritic. Despite the band's increased fame, Allmusic believed the album \\"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid, and stunning than its predecessor... Darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells.\\" Elephant was additionally notable for premiering Jack's first formal use of guitar soloing, and Rolling Stone placed him at number 17 on its list of \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\". That same year, Elephant was ranked number 390 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2009, the album came in at number 18 in NME's \\"Top 100 Greatest Albums of the decade\\". NME referred to the album as the pinnacle of the White Stripes' time as a band and one of Jack White's best works of his career. The album's first single, \\"Seven Nation Army\\", was the band's most successful. The song was at the top of the rock charts on Billboard. Its success was followed with a cover of Burt Bacharach's \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\". The album's third single was the successful \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\". \\"There's No Home for You Here\\" was the fourth single. In 2004, the album won a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album, while \\"Seven Nation Army\\" won a Grammy for Best Rock Song. =Get Behind Me Satan (2005)= In 2005, according to an interview with David Fricke of Rolling Stone, Jack began working on songs for the band's next album at his home. He played with different techniques than in past albums, trading in his electric guitar for an acoustic on all but a few of the tracks, as his trademark riff-based lead guitar style is overtaken by a predominantly rhythmic approach. The White Stripes' fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was released in 2005 on the V2 label. The title is an allusion to a Biblical quotation Jesus made to the Apostle Simon Peter from the Gospel of Matthew 16:23 of the New Testament (in the King James Version, the quotation is slightly different: \\"Get thee behind me, Satan\\"Matthew: XVI:XXIII, King James Bible. . Retrieved June 20, 2008.). Another theory about this title is that Jack and Meg White read James Joyce's story collection \\"Dubliners\\" (published 1914) and used a line from the final story \\"The Dead\\" to title this album. The title is also a direct quotation from Who bassist John Entwistle‚Äôs solo song \\"You‚Äôre Mine\\". With its reliance on piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba on \\"The Nurse\\" and \\"Forever For Her (Is Over For Me)\\", Get Behind Me Satan did not feature the explicit blues and punk styles that dominated earlier White Stripes albums. However, despite this, the band was critically lauded for their \\"fresh, arty reinterpretations of their classic inspirations.\\" It has garnered positive reactions from fans, as well as critical acclaim, receiving more Grammy nominations as well as making them one of the must-see acts of the decade. Rolling Stone ranked it the third best album of the yearRolling Stone Magazine's Top 50 Records of 2005 . Retrieved on August 30, 2008. and it received the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2006. Three singles were released from the album, the first being \\"Blue Orchid\\", a popular song on satellite radio and some FM stations. The second and third singles were \\"My Doorbell\\" and \\"The Denial Twist\\", respectively, and music videos were made for the three singles. \\"My Doorbell\\" was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The White Stripes postponed the Japanese leg of their world tour after Jack strained his vocal cords, with doctors recommending that Jack not sing or talk for two weeks. After a full recovery, he returned to the stage in Auckland, New Zealand to headline the Big Day Out tour. While on the British leg of the tour, Jack changed his name from Jack White to \\"Three quid\\". The White Stripes released a cover version of Tegan and Sara's song \\"Walking with a Ghost\\" on iTunes in November 2005. The song was later released in December as the Walking with a Ghost EP featuring four other live tracks. In October 2006, it was announced on the official White Stripes website that there would be an album of avant-garde orchestral recordings consisting of past music written by Jack called Aluminium. The album was made available for pre-order on November 6, 2006, to great demand from the band's fans; the LP version of the project sold out in a little under a day. The project was conceived by Richard Russell, founder of XL Recordings, who co-produced the album with Joby Talbot. It was recorded between August 2005 and February 2006 at Intimate Studios in Wapping, London using an orchestra. Before the album went out of print, it was available exclusively through the Aluminium website in a numbered limited edition of 3,333 CDs with 999 LPs. On January 12, 2007, V2 Records announced that, due to being under the process of reconstruction, it would no longer release new White Stripes material, leaving the band without a label.Christman, Ed (January 12, 2007), \\"V2 Restructured, White Stripes, Moby Become Free Agents\\" . Billboard. Retrieved January 22, 2007. However, as the band's contract with V2 had already expired, on February 12, 2007, it was confirmed that the band had signed a single album deal with Warner Bros. Records. =Icky Thump (2007)= The White Stripes' sixth album, Icky Thump, was released on June 19, 2007 on Warner Bros. Records. This was their first record with Warner Bros., since V2 closed in 2006, and it was released on a one-album contract. Icky Thump entered the UK Albums Chart at number one,\\"The White Stripes ‚Äì Icky Thump global chart positions and trajectories\\" . aCharts.us.

As of March 8, 2008, the album has sold 725,125 copies in the US. On February 10, 2008, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Following the well-received Get Behind Me Satan, Icky Thump marked a return to the punk, garage rock and blues influences for which the band is known. It was recorded at Nashville's Blackbird Studio and took almost three weeks to record‚Äîthe longest of any White Stripes album. It would also be their first album with a title track.

Prior to the album's release, three tracks were previewed to NME: \\"Icky Thump\\", \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You're Told)\\" and \\"Conquest\\". NME described the tracks as \\"an experimental, heavy sounding 70s riff,\\" \\"a strong, melodic love song\\" and \\"an unexpected mix of big guitars and a bold horn section,\\" respectively. On the US Billboard Charts dated May 12, 2007, \\"Icky Thump\\"‚Äîthe first single‚Äîbecame the band's first Top 40 single, charting at number 26, and later charted at number 2 in the UK. On April 25, 2007, the duo announced that they would embark on a tour of Canada, performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: \\"Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to the far reaches of the Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, The White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary.\\" Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster. The White Stripes giving an impromptu show for fans on a bus in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 2007 On June 24, 2007, just a few hours before their concert at Deer Lake Park, The White Stripes kicked off their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40-minute set for a group of 30 kids at the Creekside Youth Centre in Burnaby. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets, such as Glace Bay, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, as well as by frequent \\"secret shows\\" publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in Saskatoon, a youth center in Edmonton, a Winnipeg Transit bus and The Forks park in Winnipeg, a park in Whitehorse, the YMCA in downtown Toronto, the Arva Flour Mill in Arva, Ontario, Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and a famous one-note show on George Street in St. John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to YouTube.\\"Jack and Meg go back to school\\", The Globe and Mail, July 5, 2007. As well, the band filmed its video for \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You're Told)\\" in Iqaluit.

While on hiatus, Jack formed a group called The Dead Weather (featuring himself, Jack Lawrence, Dean Fertita, and Alison Mosshart), although he insisted that The White Stripes remained his top priority. The White Stripes performed live for the first time since September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009, where they performed an alternate version of \\"We're Going to Be Friends\\". This proved to be their final live performance as a band.

Maybe next year.\\" Jack also explained Meg's acute anxiety during the Stripes' last tour, saying, \\"I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg had come from a dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness. Meg is a very shy girl, a very quiet and shy person. To go full-speed from a dead-halt is overwhelming, and we had to take a break.\\" Under Great White Northern Lights documents The White Stripes' summer 2007 tour across Canada A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film (directed by Emmett Malloy) documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White appeared at the premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was in support of the album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing at the conclusion of the concert. The film was directed by a friend of the duo, Emmett Malloy. A second feature, Under Nova Scotian Lights, was prepared for the DVD release. In an interview with Self Titled, Jack alluded to the creation of a White Stripes film to be released later in 2009. In an interview with contactmusic.com, Jack claimed that working with The White Stripes would be \\"strange\\". \\"It would definitely be strange to go into The White Stripes again and have to rethink my game,\\" adding: \\"But that would be the best thing about it, because it would be a whole new White Stripes.\\" In 2010, a Super Bowl ad by the U.S. Air Force Reserve caused The White Stripes to \\"take strong insult and objection to the Air Force Reserve presenting this advertisement with the implication that we licensed one of our songs to encourage recruitment during a war that we do not support.\\" The Air Force Reserve denied that the song was from The White Stripes and the music was scored by an advertising agency for the commercial. In November 2010, The White Stripes contributed a previously released cover version of the song \\"Rated X\\" to the compilation album Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute To Loretta Lynn. In late 2010, The White Stripes reissued their first three albums on Third Man Records on a 180-gram vinyl along with 500 limited-edition, \\"split-colored\\" records to accompany it. Jack hinted at a possible White Stripes reunion in a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair. He said, \\"We thought we'd do a lot of things that we'd never done: a full tour of Canada, a documentary, coffee-table book, live album, a boxed set...Now that we've gotten a lot of that out of our system, Meg and I can get back in the studio and start fresh.\\" On February 2, 2011, the duo announced that they had officially ceased recording and performing music as The White Stripes. The announcement specifically denied any artistic differences or health issues, but cited \\"a myriad of reasons ... mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band\\". In a 2014 interview, Jack said that Meg's lack of enthusiasm for the project contributed to the band's breakup. White told Rolling Stone that \\"she viewed me that way of 'Oh, big deal, you did it, so what?' Almost every single moment of The White Stripes was like that. We'd be working in the studio and something amazing would happen: I'm like, 'Damn, we just broke into a new world right there!'

Jack has stated on numerous occasions that the blues is the dominant influence on his songwriting and the roots of the band's music, stating that he feels it is so sacred that playing it does not do it justice. Of The Gun Club's music in particular, Jack said, \\"'Sex Beat', 'She's Like Heroin To Me', and 'For The Love Of Ivy'...why are these songs not taught in schools?\\" Heavy blues rock bands such as the Rolling Stones and AC/DC have also influenced the band, particularly Led Zeppelin, as Jack has claimed that he \\"can't trust anybody who doesn't like Led Zeppelin.\\" Traditional country music such as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn, rockabilly acts like the Flat Duo Jets, Wanda Jackson and Gene Vincent, the surf rock of Dick Dale, and folk music like Lead Belly and Bob Dylan have also influenced the band's sound.

Early on, the band drew attention for their preference for antiquated recording equipment. In a 2001 New York Times concert reviews, Ann Powers noted that Jack's \\"ingenious\\" playing was \\"constrained by [Meg's] deliberately undeveloped approach,\\" and that \\"he created more challenges by playing an acoustic guitar with paper taped over the hole and a less-than- high-quality solid body electric.\\"POWERS, ANN (February 27, 2001). \\"POP REVIEW; Intellectualizing the Music Or Simply Experiencing It \\".

She played Ludwig Drums with Paiste cymbals, and says her pre-show warm-up consisted of \\"whiskey and Red Bull.\\" Jack downplayed criticisms of her style, insisting: > \\"I never thought 'God, I wish Neil Peart was in this band.'

For example, Elephant was recorded in about two weeks in London's Toe Rag Studio. Their 2005 follow- up, Get Behind Me Satan, was likewise recorded in just two weeks. For live shows, The White Stripes were known for Jack's employment of heavy distortion, as well as audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.Frampton, Scott (July 2007), \\"Jack & Meg White\\" . Esquire. 148 (1):p118-119 =Ballet production= In 2007, British choreographer Wayne McGregor used music by The White Stripes for his production Chroma, a piece he created for The Royal Ballet in London, England. The orchestral arrangements for Chroma were commissioned by Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, as a gift to The White Stripes and were produced by the British classical composer Joby Talbot. Three of these songs, \\"The Hardest Button To Button\\", \\"Aluminium\\" and \\"Blue Orchid\\", were first played to the band as a surprise in Cincinnati Music Hall, Ohio. McGregor heard the orchestral versions and decided to create a ballet using the music. Talbot re-orchestrated the music for the Royal Opera House orchestra, also writing three additional pieces of his own composition. The world premiere of the ballet took place on November 16, 2006 at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. The ballet subsequently won the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production. =Aesthetics and presentation= The White Stripes had a carefully constructed image built around lore they created for themselves and visual motifs. Early in their history, they turned down a potential deal with Chicago label Bobsled, because the label wanted to put its green logo on the CD. Their presentation was a subject of intrigue among the public and in the media. Early in their career, the band provided various descriptions of their relationship. Jack claimed that he and Meg were siblings, the youngest two of ten. As the story went, they became a band when, on Bastille Day 1997, Meg went to the attic of their parents' home and began to play on Jack's drum kit. This claim was widely believed and repeated despite rumors that they were, or had been, husband and wife.\\"The White Stripes ‚Äì Brief Article\\" Johnathan Moskowitz, Interview'.'

Even so, they continued to insist publicly that they were brother and sister. In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Jack claimed that this open secret was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couple's relationship: > When you see a band that is two pieces, husband and wife, boyfriend and > girlfriend, you think, 'Oh, I see...' When they're brother and sister, you > go, 'Oh, that's interesting.' You care more about the music, not the > relationship‚Äîwhether they're trying to save their relationship by being in a > band. The White Stripes made exclusive use of a red, white and black color scheme when conducting virtually all professional duties, from album art to the clothes worn during live performances; Meg said that \\"like a uniform at school, you can just focus on what you're doing because everybody's wearing the same thing.\\" Jack also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor. Spin magazine commented that \\"his songs‚Äîabout getting married in cathedrals, walking to kindergarten, and guileless companionship‚Äîare performed with an almost naive certitude.\\" Other affectations included Jack using two microphones onstage. The media and fans alike varied between intrigue and skepticism at the band's appearance and presentation. Andy Gershon, president of the V2 label at the time of their signing, was reluctant to sign them, saying, \\"They need a bass player, they've got this red-and-white gimmick, and the songs are fantastic, but they've recorded very raw...how is this going to be on radio?\\" In a 2002 Spin magazine article, Chuck Klosterman wondered, \\"how can two media-savvy kids posing as brother and sister, wearing Dr. Seuss clothes, represent blood-and-bones Detroit, a city whose greatest resource is asphalt?\\" However, in 2001, Benjamin Nugent with TIME magazine commented that \\"it's hard to begrudge [Jack] his right to nudge the spotlight toward his band, and away from his private life, by any means available.

Formed in 1989, they were one of the bands that helped define the Chapel Hill music scene of the 1990s. Their energetic, high-velocity style and do-it-yourself ethic are influenced by punk rock. Members McCaughan and Ballance founded the successful independent record label Merge Records in 1989 as a way to release music from Superchunk and music created by friends, which has expanded to include artists from around the world and records reaching the top of the Billboard music charts. Superchunk released a string of full-length albums and compilations throughout the 1990s. After releasing their eighth studio album in 2001, the band went into a period of reduced activity. In 2010, the band released a new studio album, Majesty Shredding, and followed it up in 2013 with their tenth studio album, I Hate Music. Their eleventh studio album, What a Time to Be Alive, was released on February 16, 2018. History Superchunk was formed in 1989 in the town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, by Mac McCaughan (guitar and vocals), Laura Ballance (bass), Chuck Garrison (drums), and Jack McCook (guitar). Initially, the band went by the name Chunk (original drummer Chuck Garrison's name was misspelled as \\"Chunk\\" Garrison in the phone book, and the moniker stuck), and they released their first single as Chunk. After adding the \\"Super\\" prefix to their name to avoid confusion with a similarly named jazz band from New York, the first official Superchunk single, \\"Slack Motherfucker\\", followed in 1989 on Merge Records, founded by McCaughan and Ballance. Both releases were well received, and Superchunk released its debut eponymous album in 1990 on Matador Records to more critical acclaim. McCook decided to leave the group after the release of the first album, Superchunk, and Connecticut-born James Wilbur was recruited to take over guitar duties. In spite of the ensuing bidding war that emerged between major record labels in the aftermath of the album's release, Superchunk decided to stay independent, sticking with Matador Records for their second, just as critically lauded LP, No Pocky for Kitty, which was recorded in Chicago by Steve Albini in 1991. Garrison left the band a few weeks before the record's release, and Jon Wurster was brought on board on drums. The band put out one more record for Matador, On the Mouth in 1993. After Matador entered into a distribution agreement with major label Atlantic Records, Superchunk decided to leave the label, even though the Atlantic logo did not have to be displayed on their releases. Instead, the band opted to release their following records through Merge. The next album, Foolish, brought further critical acclaim for the band in 1994. A second singles compilation (the first was 1992's Tossing Seeds) came out in the summer of 1995. It was titled Incidental Music 1991‚Äì95 and contained most of their hard-to-find tracks (imports, B-sides, comp. tracks) released between 1991 and 1995. Boston was the setting for Superchunk's next album session. 1995's Here's Where the Strings Come In was recorded at the city's Fort Apache Studios and slated for a fall release. The band toured hard for Strings all over the world as well as appearing on the Lollapalooza tour, scoring a minor hit with the \\"Hyper Enough\\" single and video. After a brief hiatus and another Australian tour, the band released a limited-edition EP called The Laughter Guns. They then started writing for what would become Indoor Living. Recording started in Bloomington, Indiana's Echo Park Studios with Chapel Hillian John Plymale co-producing with the band. Superchunk stretched out a bit on Indoor Living, expanding their sound by adding some new instruments to the mix: piano, organ, vibes and more. The album was by far their most adventurous and at the same time their most accessible to date. Superchunk delivered Come Pick Me Up, their seventh full-length studio release, in 1999, recording in Chicago at Electrical Audio with producer Jim O'Rourke. Superchunk continued the expansion and growth of their sound that started with Foolish, pushing themselves to new heights of creativity. In 2001, the band released Here's to Shutting Up. In 2002, Superchunk began a series of limited-edition live albums known as The Clambakes series. Clambakes Volume 1 (limited to 1500 copies) is an acoustic live set recorded in various record stores across the US in support of Here's to Shutting Up and Clambakes Volume 2 (limited to 2500 copies) is a film score Superchunk was commissioned to write. It was recorded live at the Castro Theater in San Francisco on April 23, 2002, during the San Francisco International Film Festival at a showing of the 1926 Teinosuke Kinugasa film A Page of Madness. Cup of Sand, released in 2003, is the third singles album compiling all singles and rare 1995‚Äì2002 tracks. Clambakes Series Volume 3 was released in 2004, documenting the live set Superchunk played at the Cat's Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina, on July 23, 1999, for the Merge Records tenth anniversary celebration. In 2006, Superchunk headlined a concert held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of The Daily Show, a Comedy Central program, at Irving Plaza in New York. The show also featured a performance from Clem Snide as well as short stand-up comedy sets from various Daily Show correspondents. Superchunk touring in Tokyo, Japan, October 30, 2007; Photo: Masao Nakagami In 2007, Superchunk contributed a hidden track to the Aqua Teen Hunger Force soundtrack, \\"Misfits and Mistakes\\", with singing from Aqua Teen Hunger Force character Meatwad. On June 5, 2007, Superchunk released the Misfits and Mistakes 7-inch, which has the Superchunk solo version on the A-side, and the Meatwad version on the B-side. The band played two shows, the Eff Cancer Benefit in Chicago on June 20, 2007, and headlined the inaugural free Pool Parties show at McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn, New York. They are also known to still play occasional one- off shows at home in North Carolina, usually at Cat's Cradle in Carrboro. Superchunk also recorded a cover version of \\"Say My Name\\" by Destiny's Child for Engine Room Recordings' compilation album Guilt by Association, which was set to be released in September 2007. Superchunk appeared at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, on April 18, 2009, along with other acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Killers, M.I.A., TV On The Radio, Band Of Horses. On April 7, 2009, Superchunk released the Leaves in the Gutter EP, their first CD release in seven years. It consisted of three unreleased tracks, in addition to \\"Misfits and Mistakes\\" and an acoustic version of the new song \\"Learned to Surf\\". On May 28, 2009, the band announced a new 7-inch, \\"Crossed Wires\\" b/w \\"Blinders (Fast Vers.)\\", which released on July 7, 2009. It was initially limited to a pressing of 1000 on clear vinyl. On July 27, 2010, the band covered The Cure's In Between Days for AV Club Undercover. The band's ninth studio album, Majesty Shredding, was released on September 14, 2010.\\"Superchunk Announce Majesty Shredding Album\\" . Exclaim!, June 3, 2010. The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England. The band's tenth studio album, I Hate Music, was released on August 20, 2013. Before the release, Ballance announced on the band's website that she would not be taking part in the upcoming tour to promote the album, citing a worsening hearing condition known as hyperacusis. Her live replacement is Jason Narducy, formerly of Verbow and currently bass player with Bob Mould's band. The band will be touring North America, Australia and the UK as part of the tour. In November 2013, the band played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. On February 27, 2016, Superchunk re-united with original drummer Chuck Garrison for a performance of \\"Slack Motherfucker\\" at the end of a Scharpling & Wurster live show in Durham, North Carolina. Jon Wurster performed some of the vocals in character as Philly Boy Roy. In November 2017, the band announced that their 11th studio album What a Time to Be Alive will be released in February 2018. On May 31, 2019, as part of Merge Records' \\"special 30th anniversary releases,\\" Superchunk released an acoustic version of their 1994 album foolish, titled Acoustic Foolish.

The product of human dialogue, social reality may be considered as consisting of the accepted social tenets of a community, involving thereby relatively stable laws and social representations.Ireke Bockting, Character and Personality in the Novels of William Faulkner (1995) p. 25 Radical constructivism would cautiously describe social reality as the product of uniformities among observers (whether or not including the current observer themselves).Niklas Luhmann, Theories of Distinction (2002) p. 136 Sch√ºtz, Durkheim, and Spencer The problem of social reality has been treated exhaustively by philosophers in the phenomenological tradition, particularly Alfred Sch√ºtz, who used the term \\"social world\\" to designate this distinct level of reality. Within the social world, Sch√ºtz distinguished between social reality that could be experienced directly (umwelt) and a social reality beyond the immediate horizon, which could yet be experienced if sought out.George Walsh, \\"Introduction\\", Alfred Sch√ºtz, The Phenomenology of the Social World (1997)p. xxvii In his wake, ethnomethodology explored further the unarticulated structure of our everyday competence and ability with social reality.John O'Neill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 217 Previously, the subject had been addressed in sociology as well as other disciplines. For example, √âmile Durkheim stressed the distinct nature of \\"the social kingdom. Here more than anywhere else the idea is the reality\\".Quoted in T. van der Eyden, Public Management of Society (2003) p. 487 Herbert Spencer had coined the term super-organic to distinguish the social level of reality above the biological and psychological.Herbert Spencer, The Principles of Sociology, Vol. 1, Part 1. \\"The Data of Sociology\\"(1876) Searle John Searle has used the theory of speech acts to explore the nature of social/institutional reality, so as to describe such aspects of social reality which he instances under the rubrics of \\"marriage, property, hiring, firing, war, revolutions, cocktail parties, governments, meetings, unions, parliaments, corporations, laws, restaurants, vacations, lawyers, professors, doctors, medieval knights, and taxes, for example\\".John R. Searle, The Construction of Social Reality (Penguin 1996) p. 79 Searle argued that such institutional realities interact with each other in what he called \\"systematic relationships (e.g., governments, marriages, corporations, universities, armies, churches)\\"Searle, p. 97 to create a multi-layered social reality. For Searle, language was the key to the formation of social reality because \\"language is precisely designed to be a self-identifying category of institutional facts\\"; i.e., a system of publicly and widely accepted symbols which \\"persist through time independently of the urges and inclinations of the participants.\\"Searle, p. 73 and p. 78 Objective/subjective There is a debate in social theory about whether social reality exists independently of people's involvement with it, or whether (as in social constructionism) it is only created by the human process of ongoing interaction.Antony Giddens, Sociology (2006) p. 152 Peter L. Berger argued for a new concern with the basic process of the social construction of reality.John O'Neill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 168 Berger stated that the social construction of reality was a process made up of three steps: externalization, objectivation and internalization. In similar fashion, post-Sartrians like R. D. Laing stress that, \\"once certain fundamental structures of experience are shared, they come to be experienced as objective entities...they take on the force and character of partial autonomous realities, with their own way of life\\".R. D. Laing, The Politics of Experience (Penguin 1984) p. 65 Yet at the same time, Laing insisted that such a socially real grouping \\"can be nothing else than the multiplicity of the points of view and actions of its members...even where, through the interiorization of this multiplicity as synthesized by each, this synthesized multiplicity becomes ubiquitous in space and enduring in time\\".Laing, p. 81 The existence of a social reality independent of individuals or the ecology would seem at odds with the views of perceptual psychology, including those of J. J. Gibson, and those of most ecological economics theories. Scholars such as John Searle argue on the one hand that \\"a socially constructed reality presupposes a reality independent of all social constructions\\".Searle, p. 190 At the same time, he accepts that social realities are humanly created, and that \\"the secret to understanding the continued existence of institutional facts is simply that the individuals directly involved and a sufficient number of members of the relevant communities must continue to recognize and accept the existence of such facts\\".Searle, p. 190 and p. 117 Socialisation and the Capital Other Freud saw a child's induction into social reality as consolidated with the passing of the Oedipus complex and the internalisation of the parents: \\"the same figures who continue to operate in the super-ego as the agency we know as conscience...also belong to the real external world. It is from there that they were drawn; their power, behind which lie hidden all the influences of the past and of tradition, was one of the most strongly-felt manifestations of reality\\".Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 422 Lacan clarified the point by stressing that this was \\"a highly significant moment in the transfer of powers from the subject to the Other, what I call the Capital Other...the field of the Other ‚Äì which, strictly speaking, is the Oedipus complex\\".Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (Penguin 1994) p. 129 and p. 205 Lacan considered that \\"the Oedipus complex...superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of nature\\",Jacques Lacan, √âcrits: A Selection (1997) p. 66 bringing the child into the Symbolic Order. Within that order, Lacanians consider that \\"institutions, as signifying practices, are much more extensive structures than romantic notions allow and they thus implicate us in ways which narrower definitions cannot recognize...exceed any intersubjective intention or effect\\".Joan Copjec, in Jacques Lacan, Television (London 1990) p. 51-2 In similar fashion, Searle asserts that \\"institutional power ‚Äì massive, pervasive, and typically invisible ‚Äì permeates every nook and cranny of our social lives...the invisible structure of social reality\\".Searle, p. 94 and p. 4 Measuring trust If one accepts the validity of the idea of social reality, scientifically, it must be amenable to measurement, something which has been explored particularly in relation to trust. \\"Trust is...part of a community's social capital, as Francis Fukuyama argues, and has deep historical and cultural roots\\".Will Hutton, The State to Come (London 1997) p. 31 Theories of the measurement of trust in the sociological community are usually called theories of social capital, to emphasize the connection to economics, and the ability to measure outputs in the same feeling. Propaganda One aspect of social reality is the principle of the \\"big lie\\", which states that an outrageous untruth is easier to convince people of than a less outrageous truth. Many examples from politics and theology (e.g., the claim that the Roman Emperor was in fact a \\"god\\") demonstrate that this principle was known by effective propagandists from the earliest times.

The band's current lineup features Corin Tucker (vocals and guitar) and Carrie Brownstein (guitar and vocals), following the departure of longtime member Janet Weiss (vocals, drums, and harmonica) in 2019. Sleater-Kinney originated as part of the riot grrrl movement and has become a key part of the American indie rock scene. The band is also known for its feminist and left-leaning politics. The band released seven studio albums between 1994 and 2005: Sleater-Kinney (1995), Call the Doctor (1996), Dig Me Out (1997), The Hot Rock (1999), All Hands on the Bad One (2000), One Beat (2002) and The Woods (2005). They went on hiatus in 2006 and devoted themselves to solo projects. They reunited in 2014 and released No Cities to Love on January 20, 2015, and Live in Paris in January 2017. Their second studio album after their reunion, The Center Won't Hold, was produced by St. Vincent, and released in August 2019. Critics Greil Marcus and Robert Christgau have each praised Sleater-Kinney as one of the essential rock groups of the early 2000s. Marcus named Sleater-Kinney America's best rock band in 2001. Tom Breihan of Stereogum called them the greatest rock band of the past two decades in 2015.  History =Formation, early years (1994‚Äì1999)= Sleater-Kinney was formed in early 1994 in Olympia, Washington, by Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein. The group's name derives from Sleater Kinney Road, in Lacey, Washington, where signs for Interstate 5 exit number 108 announce its existence. One of the band's early practice spaces was near Sleater Kinney Road. Tucker was formerly in the influential riot grrrl band Heavens to Betsy, while Brownstein was formerly in the band Excuse 17. They often played at gigs together and formed Sleater-Kinney as a side-project from their respective bands. When Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17 disbanded, Sleater-Kinney became their primary focus. Janet Weiss of Quasi was the band's longest lasting drummer, though Sleater-Kinney has had other drummers, including Lora Macfarlane, Misty Farrell, and Toni Gogin. Upon Tucker's graduation from The Evergreen State College (where Brownstein remained a student for three more years), she and then-girlfriend Brownstein took a trip to Australia in early 1994. Their last day there, they stayed up all night recording what would become their self-titled debut album. It was released the following spring. They followed this with Call the Doctor (1996) and Dig Me Out (1997), and became critical darlings as a result. Produced by John Goodmanson and recorded at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, the record was influenced by both classic rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll and the band's usual punk predecessors. From Dig Me Out onwards, the band's drummer was Janet Weiss. =Later albums (2000‚Äì2006)= Their next few albums (The Hot Rock, All Hands on the Bad One) pushed the band towards mainstream listeners, culminating in 2002's One Beat. The group opened for Pearl Jam at many North American shows beginning in 2003, and the band cited the experience of playing to large arenas as part of the inspiration and motivation for the music found on their seventh album, The Woods. The Woods was released in 2005, and was a departure from the sound of their previous albums. In its place, The Woods featured a denser, heavily distorted sound that drew on classic rock as its inspiration. In 2006 they helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival. They contributed to the Burn to Shine project, appearing on Volume 3 (Portland), playing \\"Modern Girl\\". On June 27, 2006, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating there were \\"no plans for future tours or recordings.\\" Sleater-Kinney's last major public show at this time was at the 2006 Lollapalooza music festival. The band's last appearance prior to the hiatus was at the Crystal Ballroom in Portland, Oregon, on August 12, 2006. No explanation for the hiatus was given. = Hiatus (2007‚Äì2013) = Upon the dissolution of Sleater-Kinney in 2006, Weiss joined Quasi bandmate Joanna Bolme in Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks. She performed on two albums, Real Emotional Trash in 2008 and the 2011 release Mirror Traffic. She left the band prior to the tour for the latter album. In April 2010 Tucker announced she was recording a solo album for Kill Rock Stars to be released in October 2010. Working along with Tucker on her solo album was Unwound's Sara Lund and Golden Bears'/Circus Lupus Seth Lorinczi. According to Tucker, the album would be a \\"middle-aged mom record\\". The album, entitled 1,000 Years was released on October 5, 2010, to positive reception by music critics. Tucker toured on both U.S. coasts to support the 1,000 Years album, in addition to dates in other parts of the country. The band's second album, titled Kill My Blues, was released on September 18, 2012. This album was supported by a US tour. In September 2010, Brownstein revealed her latest project was the band Wild Flag, with Janet Weiss, Mary Timony, formerly of Helium, and Rebecca Cole, formerly of The Minders.\\" Their Self-titled eponymous debut album was released on September 13, 2011, on Merge Records. By 2014, the band was no longer active. In an interview, Brownstein stated, \\"We had a fun run‚Ä¶ but all the logistics started seeming not quite worth it.\\" Brownstein's television project Portlandia premiered on IFC in January 2011 and aired a new season every year until its series finale in March 2018. = Return, and departure of Weiss (2014‚Äìpresent) = In October 2014, it was revealed the band had recorded a new album, No Cities to Love, later released on January 20, 2015. The members of Sleater-Kinney also announced a 2015 tour covering North America and western Europe. In 2014, the band released the vinyl box set of their previous releases as Start Together. It was reviewed by BUST Magazine, where writer Claire McKinzie stated, \\"With their feminist, left-leaning lyrics, Sleater- Kinney's relevance today is obvious. While some singers back away from being labeled \\"feminist,\\" Sleater-Kinney exists partially to redirect society's perception of the word.\\" In January 2017 the band released their first live album, Live in Paris, recorded at La Cigale on March 20, 2015. By January 2018, the band was said to be working on their follow-up to No Cities to Love, though Brownstein has said that they're \\"going to do this very slowly.\\" In January 2019, the band announced that a new album, produced by the artist St. Vincent (Annie Clark), was expected that year. In May 2019, Sleater-Kinney released a new song \\"Hurry on Home\\" along with a lyric video. This served as the lead single for The Center Won't Hold, released in August 2019. On July 1, 2019, Weiss announced she would be leaving the band on her Twitter account saying it was \\"time for me to move on\\". The band performed their first concert without Weiss at the Hopscotch Music Festival on September 5, with new drummer Angie Boylan.  Musical style  Sleater-Kinney in 2005. (Photo by Tyler Craft) Sleater-Kinney's musical style was rooted in Olympia, Washington's punk and independent rock scenes of the early- to mid-1990s, forming around the last years of the riot grrrl movement. Both Tucker and Brownstein came from veteran acts from the beginning of the movement. Although the band's lyrics revolved around a variety of topics, they were included in the riot grrrl movement because of the subject matter that supported feminist ideals. On the topic of the band's involvement in political movements, Carrie Brownstein was quoted, \\"Sleater-Kinney are brave enough and strong enough to make a difference and get the word out.\\"Annie Wilner. Sleater-Kinney‚Äôs Protest Rock msmagazine.com. Retrieved March 15, 2015 Their sound incorporates personal and social themes along with stripped-down music that was influenced by punk and the free-thinking ideals of 1980s-1990s alternative and indie rock. They experimented with this foundation by bringing in different instruments and arrangements. Sleater-Kinney have been compared to female singers such as Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Patti Smith and Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex.\\"Music interview: 90s Riot Grrrls Sleater Kinney\\". Swide.com. January 27, 2015. Retrieved March 18, 2015 They have also named influences such as Bikini Kill, Mecca Normal, Bratmobile, Throwing Muses and Sonic Youth. Corin Tucker's emotional vocals and the band's lyrics alternate between personal and political topics, rebelling against war, traditionalism, gender roles and consumerism from feminist and progressive perspectives. Sleater-Kinney contributed the protest song \\"Off With Your Head\\" to NOFX leader Fat Mike's Rock Against Bush compilation. In 2017, Sleater- Kinney contributed the single \\"Here We Come\\" to 7-Inches For Planned Parenthood, which is a compilation of 7-inch records and digital downloads whose proceeds went to Planned Parenthood. In a documentary about riot grrrl, Tucker revealed that her vocal style has always been intentionally harsh to suit the band's message and to demand focus from the listener, and her vocals have been described by AllMusic critic Heather Phares as \\"love-them-or-hate- them vocals.\\" At the beginning of the band's career, lead vocals were often performed by Tucker, though as the band progressed, Brownstein began to appear more as a vocalist. Both Brownstein and Tucker played guitar, with Brownstein usually handling lead and Tucker performing rhythm. Although Sleater-Kinney had no bass player, both Tucker and Brownstein tuned their guitars one and a half steps down (D‚ô≠ tuning), and Tucker's tone and style enabled her to fill the same role as a bass guitar.  Collaborations  In 1998, the band recorded \\"Big Big Lights\\", the first split single (with Cypher in the Snow) in the series of recordings dealing with women's self-defense entitled Free to Fight, and released on Candy Ass Records. In 1999, Carrie Brownstein recorded a four-song EP, The Age of Backwards, with Mary Timony in a duo called The Spells. In 2000, all three members of Sleater-Kinney assisted Robert Forster and Grant McLennan of the now-defunct Brisbane indie band The Go-Betweens to record the album The Friends of Rachel Worth. In 2003, the band recorded the song \\"Angry Inch\\" with Fred Schneider of The B-52's for the Hedwig and the Angry Inch charity tribute album Wig in a Box. Proceeds for the album went to the Harvey Milk School, a school for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth. Along with performing in Sleater-Kinney, Tucker also was a member of the band Cadallaca with Sarah Dougher and sts (both formerly of The Lookers). In a recent interview, however, she told people \\"not to hold [their] breath for a new Cadallaca album.\\" Tucker was featured on Eddie Vedder's solo album Into the Wild, where she performed vocals on the track \\"Hard Sun\\" along with Vedder. In 2008, Tucker collaborated again with Vedder on a cover of John Doe's The Golden State on Doe's Golden State EP. On November 29, 2013, the members of Sleater-Kinney joined Pearl Jam and Scott McCaughey and Peter Buck (who were members of the retired band R.E.M.) during a concert in Portland for a cover of Neil Young's \\"Rocking in the Free World\\". In 2015, Sleater-Kinney collaborated with Bob's Burgers to create a video for the song \\"A New Wave\\" off their album No Cities to Love.

The memoir's title is a reference to the Vermeer painting Girl Interrupted at Her Music.Girl, Interrupted, Variety, December 10, 1999 While writing the novel Far Afield, Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at McLean Hospital.A teenager's interrupted life, Knight Ridder Newspapers, December 1, 1993 She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer. A film adaptation of the memoir directed by James Mangold, and starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, was released in 1999. Plot In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, after attempting suicide by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and her stay extends to 18 monthsSusanna Kaysen finds stability in examining youthful 'insanity', Knight-Ridder Newspapers, August 4, 1993 rather than the proposed couple of weeks. Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna's experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy died by suicide on her birthday. Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory. Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that sanity is a falsehood constructed to help the \\"healthy\\" feel \\"normal\\" in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat mental illness, and whether they are treating the brain or the mind. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of depersonalization, where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has \\"lost her bones.\\" She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general anesthesia, when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication. After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane. =Structure= Girl, Interrupted does not follow a linear storyline, but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital. She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world. She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap. Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital. Characters There are two main groups of characters, the patients and the staff. In addition to those there are her parents, her boyfriend and various other minor characters such as her former boss. =Patients= ;Susanna Kaysen :The autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for borderline personality disorder following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending there. ;Lisa Rowe :Lisa is diagnosed as a sociopath, but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who never sleeps and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn't get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has an ongoing rivalry with Lisa Cody that ends in Lisa Cody reverting to drugs. ;Polly Clark :Polly is a disfigured patient who was hospitalised for schizophrenia and depression. Polly has severe scarring on her body, the result of setting herself on fire. According to Kaysen, because of the sheer guts it took to actually do it, Polly is highly respected for her courage, to the extent that none of the patients will ask why she did it. During her first year at the hospital, she appears calm and even cheerful: \\"Life was hellish, she knew that. But, her smile hinted, she'd burned all that out of her.\\"Susana Kaysen, Girl, Interrupted (Virago Press, 2000 ed.) But one day she suddenly breaks down and begins to scream inconsolably, as if realizing for the first time her appearance and the permanency of it. Kaysen then realizes that while the other patients might be released from the hospital, Polly is trapped forever in her scarred body. ;Georgina Tuskin :Hospitalized for schizophrenia, Georgina is Susanna's roommate at the institution. The two of them are considered the healthiest patients on the ward and are good friends throughout the book. Georgina apparently experienced her first symptoms after an episode in a movie theatre where she suddenly felt as if the darkness had surrounded her completely. It is not clear what the immediate reason for her diagnosis is. She also has a boyfriend in the hospital named Wade. ;Lisa Cody :Lisa is admitted to the ward after Susanna, and from her first days there she looks up to Lisa Rowe. She, too, is diagnosed as a sociopath, though Rowe questions this and is clearly annoyed that she is no longer the only sociopath there. A former drug addict like Rowe, she tries hard to defend herself from Lisa Rowe's accusations that she isn't \\"real\\". She eventually escapes and is apparently found by Lisa Rowe during one of her escapes from the hospital. Lisa tells the other girls with pride that Lisa Cody has become a \\"real\\" drug addict. Her fate after her escape is not described any further. ;Daisy Randone :Daisy is a thin girl who arrives before Thanksgiving each year, staying through Christmas. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. The other girls think she is addicted to laxatives. She eats only chicken, and does so only in her room. However, after letting Lisa into her room, Lisa reports back to the rest of them that she only needs the laxatives because of all of the chicken. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it is time to leave the hospital, possibly due to obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. Daisy's father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has incestuous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as \\"sexy\\" and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates it when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward. ;Torrey :Torrey is a former drug addict. She was put into the ward after her parents discovered her promiscuity. She is the best friend of all the fellow patients. Her parents take her out against her will, and take her back to Mexico, where she believes she will become an amphetamine addict again. She describes Mexico, saying \\"being in Mexico means being dead and shooting speed to feel like you're not quite dead\\" (Kaysen, 97). The girls do try to help her with an escape plan and pool their money for her to help her, but eventually that plan is ruined, partly by Torrey herself, as she is too afraid to do it, and partly by Valerie after she gives Torrey a cup of thorazine just prior to her departure to calm her down. Though she only appears for a short time she is an important character. Kaysen distinguishes between those put there indefinitely by parents willing to pay without questioning the progress of their treatment and those whose parents are not willing to do so. Torrey is used as an example of the latter group. ;Alice Calais :At first Alice seems quiet and, in Kaysen's words, \\"not too crazy\\"; but after about a month she breaks down and is taken to maximum security. When the girls go to visit her they find that she has painted herself and the walls in her seclusion room with her own feces. Most of the other patients believe she was \\"raised in a closet\\" because she is ignorant about the trivial things in life. For example, she has never tasted honey and doesn't know how it tastes. She is also completely unaware that her last name is a well-known location in France and is overwhelmed in awe when she hears of the Hundred Years' War. It is not explained what happens to her after the girls visit her. ;Wade :Wade, Georgina's boyfriend, is also a patient. Wade entertains the female patients with stories about his father, who he claims to be a CIA agent. He is prone to violent outbursts, which eventually results in his being moved to the maximum-security ward. ;Cynthia Crowley :A severely depressive patient who undergoes weekly electroconvulsive therapy. There are only a few references to her in the book and she isn't a major character in it. =Staff= ;Valerie :The head nurse on the ward. She works there during the day and though she can be strict she is generally liked by the patients and Kaysen in particular. She is described as down to earth and rarely uses the psychiatric terms used by the therapists, which is something that Susanna herself despises. Kaysen recalls her as honest and direct. ;Mrs. McWeeney :The evening nurse on the ward. Described as the exact opposite of Valerie and very much disliked by the patients. Kaysen recalls her as \\"clearly nuts\\". Valerie does not like her and tends to ignore her, although she does describe her as a professional when the patients complain to her. ;Dr. Wick :The consultant psychiatrist. She is described as very old-fashioned and easy to embarrass. Susanna purposely tries to embarrass her, deliberately saying things that she knows Dr. Wick will react to, during their sessions together. She has previously worked in Africa and her direct contact with the patients is very limited, talking to them for only a matter of minutes in a session. ;Melvin :Kaysen's late therapist and analyst. Susanna says that the two of them used to be good friends and that she once enjoyed sessions with him. According to her, he was old, balding, and slightly unattractive. Susanna would go into his office sometimes and just sit there in silence because there wasn't very much silence in the hospital and she needed a break. However, this relationship was short-lived; Melvin rolled into the hospital parking lot, and, when greeted enthusiastically by Susanna, refused to entertain her. Her opinion of him spiraled downward from that point.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), formerly referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography, is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material. Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out of the column. HPLC has been used for manufacturing (e.g., during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products), legal (e.g., detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine), research (e.g., separating the components of a complex biological sample, or of similar synthetic chemicals from each other), and medical (e.g., detecting vitamin D levels in blood serum) purposes. Chromatography can be described as a mass transfer process involving adsorption. HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid and a sample mixture through a column filled with adsorbent, leading to the separation of the sample components. The active component of the column, the adsorbent, is typically a granular material made of solid particles (e.g., silica, polymers, etc.), 2‚Äì50 Œºm in size. The components of the sample mixture are separated from each other due to their different degrees of interaction with the adsorbent particles. The pressurized liquid is typically a mixture of solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile and/or methanol) and is referred to as a \\"mobile phase\\". Its composition and temperature play a major role in the separation process by influencing the interactions taking place between sample components and adsorbent. These interactions are physical in nature, such as hydrophobic (dispersive), dipole‚Äìdipole and ionic, most often a combination. HPLC is distinguished from traditional (\\"low pressure\\") liquid chromatography because operational pressures are significantly higher (50‚Äì350 bar), while ordinary liquid chromatography typically relies on the force of gravity to pass the mobile phase through the column. Due to the small sample amount separated in analytical HPLC, typical column dimensions are 2.1‚Äì4.6 mm diameter, and 30‚Äì250 mm length. Also HPLC columns are made with smaller adsorbent particles (2‚Äì50 Œºm in average particle size). This gives HPLC superior resolving power (the ability to distinguish between compounds) when separating mixtures, which makes it a popular chromatographic technique. The schematic of an HPLC instrument typically includes a degasser, sampler, pumps, and a detector. The sampler brings the sample mixture into the mobile phase stream which carries it into the column. The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the column. The detector generates a signal proportional to the amount of sample component emerging from the column, hence allowing for quantitative analysis of the sample components. A digital microprocessor and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis. Some models of mechanical pumps in an HPLC instrument can mix multiple solvents together in ratios changing in time, generating a composition gradient in the mobile phase. Various detectors are in common use, such as UV/Vis, photodiode array (PDA) or based on mass spectrometry. Most HPLC instruments also have a column oven that allows for adjusting the temperature at which the separation is performed. Operation The sample mixture to be separated and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), into the stream of mobile phase percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, on the nature of the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte. Many different types of columns are available, filled with adsorbents varying in particle size, and in the nature of their surface (\\"surface chemistry\\"). The use of smaller particle size packing materials requires the use of higher operational pressure (\\"backpressure\\") and typically improves chromatographic resolution (the degree of peak separation between consecutive analytes emerging from the column). Sorbent particles may be hydrophobic or polar in nature. Common mobile phases used include any miscible combination of water with various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts to assist in the separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant (\\"isocratic elution mode\\") or varied (\\"gradient elution mode\\") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5‚Äì25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1‚Äì3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile. A rotary fraction collector collecting HPLC output. The system is being used to isolate a fraction containing Complex I from E. coli plasma membranes. About 50 litres of bacteria were needed to isolate this amount. The chosen composition of the mobile phase (also called eluent) depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components (\\"analytes\\") and stationary phase (e.g., hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process taking place in the column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid‚Äìliquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e., in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength). The choice of mobile phase components, additives (such as salts or acids) and gradient conditions depends on the nature of the column and sample components. Often a series of trial runs is performed with the sample in order to find the HPLC method which gives adequate separation. History and development Prior to HPLC scientists used standard liquid chromatographic techniques. Liquid chromatographic systems were largely inefficient due to the flow rate of solvents being dependent on gravity. Separations took many hours, and sometimes days to complete. Gas chromatography (GC) at the time was more powerful than liquid chromatography (LC), however, it was believed that gas phase separation and analysis of very polar high molecular weight biopolymers was impossible. GC was ineffective for many biochemists because of the thermal instability of the solutes.Henry, Richard A. (1 February 2009) \\"The Early Days of HPLC at Dupont\\". Chromatography Online. Avanstar Communications Inc. As a result, alternative methods were hypothesized which would soon result in the development of HPLC. Following on the seminal work of Martin and Synge in 1941, it was predicted by Cal Giddings, Josef Huber, and others in the 1960s that LC could be operated in the high-efficiency mode by reducing the packing- particle diameter substantially below the typical LC (and GC) level of 150 Œºm and using pressure to increase the mobile phase velocity. These predictions underwent extensive experimentation and refinement throughout the 60s into the 70s. Early developmental research began to improve LC particles, and the invention of Zipax, a superficially porous particle, was promising for HPLC technology.Iler, R.K. (1979) The Chemistry of Silica. John Wiley & Sons. New York. The 1970s brought about many developments in hardware and instrumentation. Researchers began using pumps and injectors to make a rudimentary design of an HPLC system. Gas amplifier pumps were ideal because they operated at constant pressure and did not require leak-free seals or check valves for steady flow and good quantitation. Hardware milestones were made at Dupont IPD (Industrial Polymers Division) such as a low-dwell-volume gradient device being utilized as well as replacing the septum injector with a loop injection valve. While instrumentational developments were important, the history of HPLC is primarily about the history and evolution of particle technology. After the introduction of porous layer particles, there has been a steady trend to reduced particle size to improve efficiency. However, by decreasing particle size, new problems arose. The practical disadvantages stem from the excessive pressure drop needed to force mobile fluid through the column and the difficulty of preparing a uniform packing of extremely fine materials.Giddings, J. Calvin (1965) Dynamics of Chromatography, Part I. Principles and Theory. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York. p. 281. Every time particle size is reduced significantly, another round of instrument development usually must occur to handle the pressure. Types=Partition chromatography= HILIC Partition Technique Useful Range Partition chromatography was one of the first kinds of chromatography that chemists developed. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquid‚Äìliquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an \\"inert\\" solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the eluent. Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run. from review The polar analytes diffuse into a stationary water layer associated with the polar stationary phase and are thus retained. The stronger the interactions between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) the longer the elution time. The interaction strength depends on the functional groups part of the analyte molecular structure, with more polarized groups (e.g., hydroxyl-) and groups capable of hydrogen bonding inducing more retention. Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions can also increase retention. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase retention times. =Normal‚Äìphase chromatography= Normal‚Äìphase chromatography was one of the first kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g., Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers. The use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will increase the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce faster elution (decreased retention times). Very polar solvents such as traces of water in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention. This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (i.e., analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the sorbent surface; see also reversed- phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still widely used for structural isomer separations in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports. Partition- and NP- HPLC fell out of favor in the 1970s with the development of reversed-phase HPLC because of poor reproducibility of retention times due to the presence of a water or protic organic solvent layer on the surface of the silica or alumina chromatographic media. This layer changes with any changes in the composition of the mobile phase (e.g., moisture level) causing drifting retention times. Recently, partition chromatography has become popular again with the development of Hilic bonded phases which demonstrate improved reproducibility, and due to a better understanding of the range of usefulness of the technique. =Displacement chromatography= The basic principle of displacement chromatography is: A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.Displacement Chromatography. Sacheminc.com. Retrieved 2011-06-07. There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than ‚Äúpeaks‚Äù. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentration. =Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC)= A chromatogram of complex mixture (perfume water) obtained by reversed phase HPLC Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the eluent. RP-HPLC is so commonly used that it is often incorrectly referred to as \\"HPLC\\" without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release. RP-HPLC operates on the principle of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for \\"cavity- reduction\\" around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the eluent (water: 7.3 J/cm¬≤, methanol: 2.2 J/cm¬≤) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. Gradient elution uses this effect by automatically reducing the polarity and the surface tension of the aqueous mobile phase during the course of the analysis. Structural properties of the analyte molecule play an important role in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (C‚ÄìH, C‚ÄìC, and generally non-polar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) is retained longer because it is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, analytes with higher polar surface area (conferred by the presence of polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO‚àí or -NH3+ in their structure) are less retained as they are better integrated into water. Such interactions are subject to steric effects in that very large molecules may have only restricted access to the pores of the stationary phase, where the interactions with surface ligands (alkyl chains) take place. Such surface hindrance typically results in less retention. Retention time increases with hydrophobic (non-polar) surface area. Branched chain compounds elute more rapidly than their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C‚ÄìC bonds elute later than those with a C=C or C‚ÄìC triple bond, as the double or triple bond is shorter than a single C‚ÄìC bond. Aside from mobile phase surface tension (organizational strength in eluent structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention. For example, the addition of inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5 J/cm¬≤ per Mol for NaCl, 2.5 J/cm¬≤ per Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the entropy of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteins and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC). Another important factor is the mobile phase pH since it can change the hydrophobic character of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a buffering agent, such as sodium phosphate, to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH, neutralize the charge on the silica surface of the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. Ammonium formate is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium adducts. A volatile organic acid such as acetic acid, or most commonly formic acid, is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is used to analyze the column eluant. Trifluoroacetic acid is used infrequently in mass spectrometry applications due to its persistence in the detector and solvent delivery system, but can be effective in improving retention of analytes such as carboxylic acids in applications utilizing other detectors, as it is a fairly strong organic acid. The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution. Reversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage compared with normal silica columns; however, many reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles and should never be used with aqueous bases as these will destroy the underlying silica particle. They can be used with aqueous acid, but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long, as it can corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. RP-HPLC columns should be flushed with clean solvent after use to remove residual acids or buffers, and stored in an appropriate composition of solvent. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a column is to inject a sample which is a mixture of 2,2'- and 4,4'-bipyridine. Because the 2,2'-bipy can chelate the metal, the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted (tailed) when metal ions are present on the surface of the silica... =Size-exclusion chromatography= Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), also known as gel permeation chromatography or gel filtration chromatography, separates particles on the basis of molecular size (actually by a particle's Stokes radius). It is generally a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, \\"polishing\\" step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping these smaller molecules in the pores of a particle. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time. This technique is widely used for the molecular weight determination of polysaccharides. SEC is the official technique (suggested by European pharmacopeia) for the molecular weight comparison of different commercially available low-molecular weight heparins. =Ion-exchange chromatography= In ion-exchange chromatography (IC), retention is based on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Solute ions of the same charge as the charged sites on the column are excluded from binding, while solute ions of the opposite charge of the charged sites of the column are retained on the column. Solute ions that are retained on the column can be eluted from the column by changing the solvent conditions (e.g., increasing the ion effect of the solvent system by increasing the salt concentration of the solution, increasing the column temperature, changing the pH of the solvent, etc.). Types of ion exchangers include polystyrene resins, cellulose and dextran ion exchangers (gels), and controlled-pore glass or porous silica. Polystyrene resins allow cross linkage which increases the stability of the chain. Higher cross linkage reduces swerving, which increases the equilibration time and ultimately improves selectivity. Cellulose and dextran ion exchangers possess larger pore sizes and low charge densities making them suitable for protein separation. In general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller radius. An increase in counter ion (with respect to the functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time. A decrease in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while an increase in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange. By lowering the pH of the solvent in a cation exchange column, for instance, more hydrogen ions are available to compete for positions on the anionic stationary phase, thereby eluting weakly bound cations. This form of chromatography is widely used in the following applications: water purification, preconcentration of trace components, ligand-exchange chromatography, ion- exchange chromatography of proteins, high-pH anion-exchange chromatography of carbohydrates and oligosaccharides, and others. =Bioaffinity chromatography= This chromatographic process relies on the property of biologically active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites. =Aqueous normal-phase chromatography= Aqueous normal-phase chromatography (ANP) is a chromatographic technique which encompasses the mobile phase region between reversed-phase chromatography (RP) and organic normal phase chromatography (ONP). This technique is used to achieve unique selectivity for hydrophilic compounds, showing normal phase elution using reversed-phase solvents. Isocratic and gradient elution At the ARS Natural Products Utilization Research Unit in Oxford, MS., a support scientist (r) extracts plant pigments that will be analyzed by a plant physiologist (l) using an HPLC system. A separation in which the mobile phase composition remains constant throughout the procedure is termed isocratic (meaning constant composition). (The example of these the percentage of methanol throughout the procedure will remain constant i.e 10%) The word was coined by Csaba Horvath who was one of the pioneers of HPLC., The mobile phase composition does not have to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a gradient elution. One example is a gradient starting at 10% methanol and ending at 90% methanol after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed \\"A\\" and \\"B\\"; A is the \\"weak\\" solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while B is the \\"strong\\" solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In reversed-phase chromatography, solvent A is often water or an aqueous buffer, while B is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as acetonitrile, methanol, THF, or isopropanol. In isocratic elution, peak width increases with retention time linearly according to the equation for N, the number of theoretical plates. This leads to the disadvantage that late-eluting peaks get very flat and broad. Their shape and width may keep them from being recognized as peaks. A schematic of gradient elution. Increasing mobile phase strength sequentially elutes analytes having varying interaction strength with the stationary phase. Gradient elution decreases the retention of the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components. This also improves the peak shape for tailed peaks, as the increasing concentration of the organic eluent pushes the tailing part of a peak forward. This also increases the peak height (the peak looks \\"sharper\\"), which is important in trace analysis. The gradient program may include sudden \\"step\\" increases in the percentage of the organic component, or different slopes at different times ‚Äì all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time. In isocratic elution, the selectivity does not change if the column dimensions (length and inner diameter) change ‚Äì that is, the peaks elute in the same order. In gradient elution, the elution order may change as the dimensions or flow rate change. The driving force in reversed phase chromatography originates in the high order of the water structure. The role of the organic component of the mobile phase is to reduce this high order and thus reduce the retarding strength of the aqueous component. Parameters=Theoretical= HPLC separations have theoretical parameters and equations to describe the separation of components into signal peaks when detected by instrumentation such as by a UV detector or a mass spectrometer. The parameters are largely derived from two sets of chromatagraphic theory: plate theory (as part of Partition chromatography), and the rate theory of chromatography / Van Deemter equation. Of course, they can be put in practice through analysis of HPLC chromatograms, although rate theory is considered the more accurate theory. They are analogous to the calculation of retention factor for a paper chromatography separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(N), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations tend to be more subtle than other HPLC modes (e.g., ion exchange and size exclusion). Void volume is the amount of space in a column that is occupied by solvent. It is the space within the column that is outside of the column's internal packing material. Void volume is measured on a chromatogram as the first component peak detected, which is usually the solvent that was present in the sample mixture; ideally the sample solvent flows through the column without interacting with the column, but is still detectable as distinct from the HPLC solvent. The void volume is used as a correction factor. Efficiency factor (N) practically measures how sharp component peaks on the chromatogram are, as ratio of the component peak's area (\\"retention time\\") relative to the width of the peaks at their widest point (at the baseline). Peaks that are tall, sharp, and relatively narrow indicate that separation method efficiently removed a component from a mixture; high efficiency. Efficiency is very dependent upon the HPLC column and the HPLC method used. Efficiency factor is synonymous with plate number, and the 'number of theoretical plates'. Retention factor (kappa prime) measures how long a component of the mixture stuck to the column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a chromatogram (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time). Each chromatogram peak will have its own retention factor (e.g., kappa1 for the retention factor of the first peak). This factor may be corrected for by the void volume of the column. Separation factor (alpha) is a relative comparison on how well two neighboring components of the mixture were separated (i.e., two neighboring bands on a chromatogram). This factor is defined in terms of a ratio of the retention factors of a pair of neighboring chromatogram peaks, and may also be corrected for by the void volume of the column. The greater the separation factor value is over 1.0, the better the separation, until about 2.0 beyond which an HPLC method is probably not needed for separation. Resolution equations relate the three factors such that high efficiency and separation factors improve the resolution of component peaks in an HPLC separation. =Internal diameter= Tubing on a nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) system, used for very low flow capacities. The internal diameter (ID) of an HPLC column is an important parameter that influences the detection sensitivity and separation selectivity in gradient elution. It also determines the quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column. Larger columns are usually seen in industrial applications, such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low-ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption at the expense of loading capacity. Larger ID columns (over 10 mm) are used to purify usable amounts of material because of their large loading capacity. Analytical scale columns (4.6 mm) have been the most common type of columns, though smaller columns are rapidly gaining in popularity. They are used in traditional quantitative analysis of samples and often use a UV-Vis absorbance detector. Narrow-bore columns (1‚Äì2 mm) are used for applications when more sensitivity is desired either with special UV-vis detectors, fluorescence detection or with other detection methods like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry Capillary columns (under 0.3 mm) are used almost exclusively with alternative detection means such as mass spectrometry. They are usually made from fused silica capillaries, rather than the stainless steel tubing that larger columns employ. =Particle size= Most traditional HPLC is performed with the stationary phase attached to the outside of small spherical silica particles (very small beads). These particles come in a variety of sizes with 5 ¬µm beads being the most common. Smaller particles generally provide more surface area and better separations, but the pressure required for optimum linear velocity increases by the inverse of the particle diameter squared.Majors, Ronald E.. (2010-09-07) Fast and Ultrafast HPLC on sub-2 Œºm Porous Particles ‚Äî Where Do We Go From Here? ‚Äì LC-GC Europe. Lcgceurope.com. Retrieved 2011-06-07. This means that changing to particles that are half as big, keeping the size of the column the same, will double the performance, but increase the required pressure by a factor of four. Larger particles are used in preparative HPLC (column diameters 5 cm up to >30 cm) and for non-HPLC applications such as solid-phase extraction. =Pore size= Many stationary phases are porous to provide greater surface area. Small pores provide greater surface area while larger pore size has better kinetics, especially for larger analytes. For example, a protein which is only slightly smaller than a pore might enter the pore but does not easily leave once inside. Based on four factors, time, temperature, solid to liquid ratio and concentration of NaOH =Pump pressure= Pumps vary in pressure capacity, but their performance is measured on their ability to yield a consistent and reproducible volumetric flow rate. Pressure may reach as high as 60 MPa (6000 lbf/in2), or about 600 atmospheres. Modern HPLC systems have been improved to work at much higher pressures, and therefore are able to use much smaller particle sizes in the columns (<2 Œºm). These \\"ultra high performance liquid chromatography\\" systems or UHPLCs can work at up to 120 MPa (17,405 lbf/in2), or about 1200 atmospheres. 1290 Infinity Quaternary Pump. Agilent The term \\"UPLC\\" is a trademark of the Waters Corporation, but is sometimes used to refer to the more general technique of UHPLC. =Detectors= HPLC detectors fall into two main categories: universal or selective. Universal detectors typically measure a bulk property (e.g., refractive index) by measuring a difference of a physical property between the mobile phase and mobile phase with solute while selective detectors measure a solute property (e.g., UV-Vis absorbance) by simply responding to the physical or chemical property of the solute. HPLC most commonly uses a UV-Vis absorbance detector, however, a wide range of other chromatography detectors can be used. A universal detector that complements UV-Vis absorbance detection is the Charged aerosol detector (CAD). A kind of commonly utilized detector includes refractive index detectors, which provide readings by measuring the changes in the refractive index of the eluant as it moves through the flow cell. In certain cases, it is possible to use multiple detectors, for example LCMS normally combines UV-Vis with a mass spectrometer. =Autosamplers= Large numbers of samples can be automatically injected onto an HPLC system, by the use of HPLC autosamplers. In addition, HPLC autosamplers have an injection volume and technique which is exactly the same for each injection, consequently they provide a high degree of injection volume precision.  Applications = Manufacturing = HPLC has many applications in both laboratory and clinical science. It is a common technique used in pharmaceutical development, as it is a dependable way to obtain and ensure product purity. While HPLC can produce extremely high quality (pure) products, it is not always the primary method used in the production of bulk drug materials. According to the European pharmacopoeia, HPLC is used in only 15.5% of syntheses.The European Pharmacopoeia, 2002. fourth ed., Council of Europe, Strasbourg. However, it plays a role in 44% of syntheses in the United States pharmacopoeia.United States Pharmacopoeia, 2004. 27th ed. The USP Convention Inc., Rockville, MD. This could possibly be due to differences in monetary and time constraints, as HPLC on a large scale can be an expensive technique. An increase in specificity, precision, and accuracy that occurs with HPLC unfortunately corresponds to an increase in cost. = Legal = This technique is also used for detection of illicit drugs in urine. The most common method of drug detection is an immunoassay. This method is much more convenient. However, convenience comes at the cost of specificity and coverage of a wide range of drugs. As HPLC is a method of determining (and possibly increasing) purity, using HPLC alone in evaluating concentrations of drugs is somewhat insufficient. With this, HPLC in this context is often performed in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Using liquid chromatography instead of gas chromatography in conjunction with MS circumvents the necessity for derivitizing with acetylating or alkylation agents, which can be a burdensome extra step. This technique has been used to detect a variety of agents like doping agents, drug metabolites, glucuronide conjugates, amphetamines, opioids, cocaine, BZDs, ketamine, LSD, cannabis, and pesticides. Performing HPLC in conjunction with Mass spectrometry reduces the absolute need for standardizing HPLC experimental runs. = Research = Similar assays can be performed for research purposes, detecting concentrations of potential clinical candidates like anti-fungal and asthma drugs. This technique is obviously useful in observing multiple species in collected samples, as well, but requires the use of standard solutions when information about species identity is sought out. It is used as a method to confirm results of synthesis reactions, as purity is essential in this type of research. However, mass spectrometry is still the more reliable way to identify species. = Medical = Medical use of HPLC can include drug analysis, but falls more closely under the category of nutrient analysis. While urine is the most common medium for analyzing drug concentrations, blood serum is the sample collected for most medical analyses with HPLC. Other methods of detection of molecules that are useful for clinical studies have been tested against HPLC, namely immunoassays. In one example of this, competitive protein binding assays (CPBA) and HPLC were compared for sensitivity in detection of vitamin D. Useful for diagnosing vitamin D deficiencies in children, it was found that sensitivity and specificity of this CPBA reached only 40% and 60%, respectively, of the capacity of HPLC. While an expensive tool, the accuracy of HPLC is nearly unparalleled.

It was designed in the early 1980s by Matra and first used for the then-new Lille Metro system. This was one of the world's first fully automated driverless mass-transit rail networks to serve a city centre (preceded only by the Port Island Line in Kobe, Japan), and the first such in Europe.Bushell, Chris, ed.

In contrast to some other driverless metro systems like the Docklands Light Railway or Vancouver's SkyTrain, the VAL design uses platforms that are separated from the rollways by a glass partition, to prevent waiting passengers from straying or falling onto the rollways. Platform screen doors ‚Äì produced by Swiss glass door manufacturer Kaba Gilgen AG ‚Äì are embedded in these partitions and open in synchrony with the train doors when a train stops at the platform. The original platform-edge doors were manufactured and installed by PLC Peters in Hayes, Middlesex and were used on the first line. In addition to the trains being driverless, the station platforms are unstaffed in normal operation. In the original Lille metro system, they are monitored by a large closed-circuit television system with 330 cameras and 24 television monitors in a remote control room.Bushell, Chris, ed.

NeoVal CityVal for Rennes Metro Line B In 2006 the NeoVal project, successor of the VAL, was announced. It will feature regenerative braking. 40% of the 62 million Euros set aside for the programme will come from the Agence de l'innovation industrielle (the technology- supporting project agency formerly known as the AII). The program is managed by Siemens Mobility, in association with Lohr Industrie. The NeoVal will be guided by a single central rail, similar to that of the Translohr, and will be able to operate without any electrical supply between the stations (no third rail or overhead lines), making the cost of infrastructure much lower.euromedtransport.org =CityVal= CityVal is based on the NeoVal system. 19 CityVal trainsets have been ordered for the second line of the Rennes Metro. =Airval= 6 Airval trainsets has been ordered for the Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand APM system.

Medium Capacity System When VAL was introduced to Taipei, the term medium-capacity rail transport system was coined by railway planners to differentiate VAL from heavy rail (metro). Since then, this term has begun to be applied on similar capacity transit systems‚Äìmainly in Asian cities‚Äìeven when the systems are not based on VAL's technology. On Siemens' official website, VAL is advertised as the \\"first fully automated light metro\\", in which the term \\"light metro\\" can be traced back to Moscow Metro Butovskaya Light Metro Line.

The case gained international attention because of Smith's false claim that a black man had kidnapped her sons during a carjacking. Her defense attorneys, David Bruck and Judy Clarke, called expert witnesses to testify that she suffered from mental health issues that impaired her judgment when she committed the crimes. Smith was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years' imprisonment. According to the South Carolina Department of Corrections, she will be eligible for parole on November 4, 2024. She is incarcerated at the Leath Correctional Institution near Greenwood, South Carolina.\\"Inmate Details Susan Smith.\\" (Page Archive, Image Archive) South Carolina Department of Corrections. Retrieved on 2007-11-22. Family background Susan Smith rarely had a stable home life growing up. Her father died by suicide when she was six years old, and Smith herself attempted suicide at age 13. Her mother then married Beverly Russell, a member of the local chapter of the Christian Coalition, who later was revealed to have molested Smith when she was a teenager. One newspaper claimed that sexual relations between them had continued until six months before the murders. After graduating from high school in 1989, Smith made a second attempt to kill herself after a married man ended the affair they had. She married David Smith, and they had two sons. The relationship was rocky due to mutual allegations of infidelity, and they separated several times. Crimes On October 25, 1994, Smith reported to police that her vehicle had been carjacked by a black man who drove away with her sons still inside. The composite sketch of the alleged carjacker, however was \\"too generic\\" in the sense that it described half of the African-American men who lived in the community. For nine days, she made dramatic pleas on national television for the boys' safe return. However, following an intensive investigation and a nationwide search for her children, she confessed on November 3, 1994 to letting her car roll into nearby John D. Long Lake, drowning them inside. Her motivation was reportedly to facilitate a relationship with a local wealthy man by the name of Tom Findlay. Prior to the murders he sent Susan a letter ending their relationship and expressing that he did not want children. She said that there was no motive nor did she plan the murders, stating that she was not in a right state of mind. Later investigation revealed that detectives doubted Smith's story from the start and believed that she murdered her sons. By the second day of the investigation, the police suspected that she knew their location and hoped that they were still alive. Investigators started to search the nearby lakes and ponds, including John D. Long Lake, where their bodies eventually were found. Initial water searches did not locate the car because the police believed it would be within 30 feet of the shore, and did not search farther; it turned out to be 122 feet from the shore. After the boys had been missing for two days, Smith and her estranged husband David were subjected to a polygraph test. The biggest breakthrough of the case was her description of the carjacking location. She had claimed that a traffic light had turned red causing her to stop at an otherwise empty intersection. However, it was determined that the light would not have turned red for her unless a vehicle was present on the intersecting road. This conflicted with her statement that she did not see any other cars there when the carjacking took place. Smith's defense psychiatrist diagnosed her with dependent personality disorder and major depression. Incarceration Smith was incarcerated in the Administrative Segregation Unit in the Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina. During Smith's incarceration at the Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution, two correctional officers, Lieutenant Houston Cagle and Captain Alfred R. Rowe Jr., were charged after having sex with her. Consequently, she was moved to the Leath Correctional Institution in Greenwood. See also * Racial hoax * China P.

It tells the origin of the god Om, and his relations with his prophet, the reformer Brutha. In the process, it satirises religious institutions, people, and practices, and the role of religion in political life. Plot The Great God Om tries to manifest himself once more in the world, as the time of his eighth prophet is nigh. He is surprised, however, when he finds himself in the body of a tortoise, stripped of his divine powers. In the gardens of Omnia's capital he addresses the novice Brutha, the only one able to hear his voice. Om has a hard time convincing the boy of his godliness, as Brutha is convinced that Om can do anything he wants, and would not want to appear as a tortoise. Brutha is gifted with an eidetic memory and is therefore chosen by Vorbis, the head of the Quisition, to come along on a diplomatic mission to Ephebe. However, Brutha is also considered unintelligent, since he never learned to read, and rarely thinks for himself. This begins to change after Brutha discovers Ephebe's philosophers; the idea of people entertaining ideas they're not certain they believe or even understand, let alone starting fistfights over them, is an entirely new concept to him. With the help of Ephebe's Great Library, and the philosophers Didactylos, his nephew, Urn, and Abraxas, Om learns that Brutha is the only one left who believes in him. All others either just fear the Quisition's wrath or go along with the church out of habit. While in Ephebe, Brutha's memory aids an Omnian raid through the Labyrinth guarding the Tyrant's palace. While in the library of Ephebe, Brutha also memorizes many scrolls in order to protect Ephebeian knowledge as Didactylos sets fire to the building, to stop Vorbis reading the scrolls there. Completely unrelated to the story, the Librarian of the Unseen University travels through L-Space to rescue several of the abandoned scrolls. Fleeing the ensuing struggle by boat, Brutha, Om and a severely injured Vorbis end up lost in the desert. Trekking home to Omnia, they encounter ruined temples as well as the small gods who are faint ghost- like beings yearning to be believed in to become powerful. Realizing his 'mortality' and how important his believers are to him, Om begins to care about them for the first time. While Brutha, Vorbis, and Om are in the desert, the Tyrant of Ephebe manages to regain control of the city and contacts other nations who have been troubled by Omnia's imperialistic interactions with the other countries around it. On the desert's edge, a recovered Vorbis attempts to finish off Om's tortoise form, abducts Brutha, and proceeds to become ordained as the Eighth Prophet. Brutha is to be publicly burned for heresy while strapped on a heatable bronze turtle when Om comes to the rescue, dropping from an eagle's claws onto Vorbis' head. As a great crowd witnesses this miracle they come to believe in Om and he becomes powerful again. Om manifests himself within the citadel and attempts to grant Brutha the honour of establishing the Church's new doctrines. However, Brutha does not agree with Om's new rule and explains that the Church should care for people while having a tolerance for other religious practices. Meanwhile, Ephebe has gained the support of several other nations and has sent an army against Omnia, establishing a beachhead near the citadel. Brutha attempts to establish diplomatic contact with the generals of the opposing army. Despite trusting Brutha, the leaders state they do not trust Omnia and that bloodshed is necessary. At the same time, Simony leads the Omnian military to the beachhead and uses Urn's machine of war in order to fight the Ephebians. While the fighting occurs on the beachhead, Om attempts to physically intervene, but Brutha demands he does not interfere with the actions of humans. Om becomes infuriated but obeys Brutha, but he travels to the highest mountain on Discworld where gods gamble on the lives of humans in order to gain or lose belief. While there, Om manages to unleash his fury, striking other gods and causing a storm that disrupts the battle. Eventually, he forces all other gods of the forces at the battle to tell their soldiers to stop fighting and make peace. In the book's conclusion Brutha becomes the Eighth Prophet, ending the Quisition and reforming the church to be more open-minded and humanist. Om also agrees to forsake the smiting of Omnian citizens for at least a hundred years. The last moments of the book see Brutha's death a hundred years to the day after Om's return to power and his journey across the ethereal desert towards judgement, accompanied by the spirit of Vorbis, whom Brutha found still in the desert and upon whom he took pity. It is also revealed that this century of peace was originally meant to be a century of war and bloodshed which the History Monk Lu-Tze changed to something he liked better. Reception Australian author Jack Heath described the book as \\"one of the 20th century's finest satires\\", and added that \\"the gods are pompous, the worshippers cowed, and the priests violently closed-minded. Yet the tale is never heavy-handed, thanks to Brutha's sincerity and some deftly comical plot twists, as well as all the levity that comes from picturing an angry God trapped in the body of a tortoise.\\" Thomas M. Wagner praised it as \\"an extraordinary novel\\" on SFreviews.net, and called it a \\"biting but compassionate satire\\". In 2011, National Public Radio ranked it #57 on its list of 100 best science fiction / fantasy novels. Believers as well as unbelievers have praised the book for supporting their position, according to fan mail received by Terry Pratchett. The audio codec Ogg Vorbis is named after the character Exquisitor Vorbis in Small Gods. Adaptations In 2006 the book was adapted as a serial for BBC Radio 4. It starred Patrick Barlow as Om, Carl Prekopp as Brutha, and Alex Jennings as Vorbis. Anton Lesser was the narrator. A stage version of Small Gods was adapted in 2010 and performed between 17 and 19 February 2011 at The Assembly Rooms Theatre, Durham by OOOOK! Productions and members of Durham Student Theatre. All profits were donated to The Orangutan Foundation. The adaptation was written by Ben Saunders, a graduate of the University of Durham department of Archaeology. In January 2016 the official Terry Pratchett Twitter feed announced an upcoming comic adaptation of Small Gods by cartoonist Ray Friesen.

Vantage also has machine learning and visualization functions which can be deployed across public clouds, on- premises, and commodity infrastructure. Vantage provides storage and analysis for multi-structured data, including JSON, BSON, AVRO, CSV and XML formats. Big data Teradata began to market with the term \\"big data\\" in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to \\"new media sources, such as social media.\\" The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the \\"Petabyte club\\" in 2011 for its heaviest big data users. The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology. For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company's MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.

There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft. The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979‚Äì1980. Due to its multirole design, it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international co- operation beyond the production stage. The Tornado was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Italian Air Force, and RSAF during the Gulf War of 1991, in which the Tornado conducted many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various services were also used in The Bosnian War, Kosovo War, Iraq War, in Libya during the Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. Including all variants, 990 aircraft were built. Development=Origins= AFVG, an ancestor to the MRCA programme During the 1960s, aeronautical designers looked to variable-geometry wing designs to gain the manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings with the speed of swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft.Segell 1997, p. 124. Britain and France had initiated the BAC/Dassault AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967.\\"British-French Work On New Military Plane Periled by Cost Fight.\\" Wall Street Journal, 22 June 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.Willox 2002, p. 11. West German EWR had been developing the swing-wing EWR-Fairchild-Hiller A400 AVS Advanced Vertical Strike (which has a similar configuration to the Tornado).Flight International 1 June 1967, p. 896.Flight international 23 May 1968, p. 798. In 1968, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Canada formed a working group to examine replacements for the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, initially called the Multi Role Aircraft (MRA), later renamed as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA).Scutts 2000, p. 53.Jefford et al. 2002, p. 25. As the partner nations' requirements were so diverse, it was decided to develop a single aircraft that could perform a variety of missions that were previously undertaken by a fleet of different aircraft.Haglund 1989, pp. 47‚Äì48. Britain joined the MRCA group in 1968, represented by Air Vice-Marshal Michael Giddings, and a memorandum of agreement was drafted between Britain, West Germany, and Italy in May 1969.\\"European Nations Plan Mammoth Military Aircraft.\\" Sarasota Journal, 14 January 1969. By the end of 1968, the prospective purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft.Jefford et al. 2002, p. 28. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments had been made to the programme;Haglund 1989, p. 48. Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5. =Panavia Aircraft GmbH= On 26 March 1969, four partner nations ‚Äì United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, agreed to form a multinational company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop and manufacture the MRCA.Morris, Joe Alex Jr. \\"Messerschmitt Back in Business.\\" St. Petersburg Times, 30 April 1969. The project's aim was to produce an aircraft capable of undertaking missions in the tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence, and maritime roles. Various concepts, including alternative fixed-wing and single-engine designs, were studied while defining the aircraft.Jefford et al. 2002, p. 26. The Netherlands pulled out of the project in 1970, citing that the aircraft was too complicated and technical for the RNLAF's preferences, which had sought a simpler aircraft with outstanding manoeuvrability.Haglund 1989, p. 49. An additional blow was struck when the German requirement reduced from an initial 600 aircraft to 324 in 1972.Jefford et al. 2002, pp. 28‚Äì29. It has been suggested that Germany deliberately placed an unrealistically high initial order to secure the company headquarters and initial test flight in Germany rather than the UK, so as to have a bigger design influence. Formation take-off of an RAF Tornado GR.1 and a Tornado F.2 prototype in September 1982 When the agreement was finalised, the United Kingdom and West Germany each had a 42.5% stake of the workload, with the remaining 15% going to Italy; this division of the production work was heavily influenced by international political bargaining.Haglund 1989, pp. 52, 56. The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to BAC (now BAE Systems) in the United Kingdom; the centre fuselage to MBB (now part of Airbus) in West Germany; and the wings to Aeritalia (now Leonardo) in Italy.Segell 1997, p. 125. Similarly, tri-national worksharing was used for engines and equipment. A separate multinational company, Turbo- Union, was formed in June 1970 to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft, with ownership split 40% Rolls-Royce, 40% MTU, and 20% FIAT.Long, Wellington. \\"Swing-Wing Wonder Weapon Is Going Into Production.\\" Ludington Daily News,24 August 1976. At the conclusion of the project definition phase in May 1970, the concepts were reduced to two designs; a single seat Panavia 100 which West Germany initially preferred, and the twin-seat Panavia 200 which the RAF preferred. The aircraft was briefly called the Panavia Panther, and the project soon coalesced towards the two-seat option.Dorrell, David, ed. \\"Britain's Aircraft Industry enters the 1970s.\\" Air Pictorial, Volume 32, No. 9, September 1970, p. 306. In September 1971, the three governments signed an Intention to Proceed (ITP) document, at which point the aircraft was intended solely for the low-level strike mission, where it was viewed as a viable threat to Soviet defences in that role.Lewis, Paul. \\"Europe's Fighter Jet Program: Tornado Offers Competition for U.S. Concerns Project Valued at $17 billion.\\" The New York Times, 13 November 1979. Retrieved 13 November 1979. It was at this point that Britain's Chief of the Defence Staff announced \\"two- thirds of the fighting front line will be composed of this single, basic aircraft type\\". =Prototypes and testing= The first of fifteen development aircraft (nine prototypes, P01 to P09, and six pre-series, PS11 to PS 16) flew on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett described his experience: \\"Aircraft handling was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation\\".Jefford et al. 2002, pp. 89‚Äì90. Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds.Jefford et al. 2002, pp. 91‚Äì92, 95‚Äì96. According to Jim Quinn, programmer of the Tornado development simulation software and engineer on the Tornado engine and engine controls, the prototype was safely capable of reaching supercruise, but the engines had severe safety issues at high altitude while trying to decelerate. At high altitude and low turbine speed the compressor did not provide enough pressure to hold back the combustion pressure and would result in a violent vibration as the combustion pressure backfired into the intake. To avoid this effect the engine controls would automatically increase the minimum idle setting as altitude increased, until at very high altitudes the idle setting was so high, however, that it was close to maximum dry thrust. This resulted in one of the test aircraft being stuck in a mach 1.2 supercruise at high altitude and having to reduce speed by turning the aircraft, because the idle setting at that altitude was so high that the aircraft could not decelerate. RAE Farnborough, August 1980 The British Ministry of Supply ordered Chief Engineer Ted Talbot from the Concorde development team to provide intake design assistance to the Tornado development team in order to overcome these issues, which they hesitantly agreed to after noting that the Concorde intake data had apparently already been leaked to the Soviet Union. The German engineers working on the Tornado intake were unable to produce a functional Concorde style intake despite having data from the Concorde team. To make the problem worse, their management team incorrectly filed a patent on the Concorde design, and then tried to sue the British engineers who had provided the design to them. The German lawyers realised that the British had provided the designs to the German team, and requested further information to help their engineers overcome the problems with the Tornado intake, but Chief Engineer Talbot refused. According to Talbot, the Concorde engineers had determined the issue with the Tornado intake was that the engine did not respond to unexpected changes in the intake position, and therefore the engine was running at the wrong setting for a given position of the intake ramps. This was because the Concorde had similar issues due to control pressure not being high enough to maintain proper angles of the intake ramps. Aerodynamic forces could force the intakes into the improper position, and so they should have the ability to control the engines if this occurs. The Tornado intake system did not allow for this. Due to the behaviour of the German management team, the British engineers declined to share this information, and so the Tornado was not equipped with the more advanced intake design of the Concorde. Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during the landing roll.Burger, Œö.Œó. \\"In-Flight Short Field Landing Investigations on a Combat Aircraft with Thrust Reverser.\\" International Journal of Turbo and Jet Engines. 3, (2‚Äì3), pp. 99‚Äì104, ISSN 2191-0332.

Failure testing of the Tornado's triplex analogue command and stability augmentation system (CSAS) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs; the variable-sweep wings in combination with varying, and frequently very heavy, payloads complicated the clearance process.Pratt 2000, pp. 199, 236. =Production= A USAF F-15C flanked by Luftwaffe and RAF Tornados in 1987 The contract for the Batch 1 aircraft was signed on 29 July 1976.

Design=Overview= The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined aircraft designed to excel at low-level penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during the Cold War was the delivery of conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry allowed for minimal drag during the low-level dash towards a well-prepared enemy. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative fly-by-wire system, greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low-level flight and eased control of the aircraft.Scutts 2000, pp. 53‚Äì55. For long range missions, the Tornado has a retractable refuelling probe.Jefford et al. 2002, p. 136. Flyover of a German Navy Tornado during a training exercise in 2003 As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado is capable of undertaking more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type ‚Äì the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out ‚Äì either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles to serve in the interceptor role. Tornado operators have undertaken various life extension and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft. With these upgrades it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025, more than 50 years after the first prototype took flight. =Variable- sweep wing= Deployed swing wings In order for the Tornado to perform well as a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high- speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The smaller Tornado has many similarities with the F-111, however the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.Spick, Green and Swanborough 2001, p. 33. The level of wing sweep (i.e. the angle of the wings in relation to the fuselage) can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle. Some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing- sweep system to reduce pilot workload.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 6. When the wings are swept back, the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with the angle of the variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.Scutts 2000, p. 54.Richardson 1986, p. 18. In development, significant attention was given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect.Lake 2002, p. 446. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds.Aeroguide 21 1988, pp. 2, 8. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 2. =Avionics= Forward cockpit of an RAF Tornado GR.4 Aft cockpit of an RAF Tornado GR.4 The Tornado features a tandem-seat cockpit, crewed by a pilot and a navigator/weapons officer; both electromechanical and electro-optical controls are used to fly the aircraft and manage its systems.Jukes 2004, p. 48. An array of dials and switches are mounted on either side of a centrally placed CRT monitor, controlling the navigational, communications, and weapons-control computers.Jarrett 2005, pp. 3‚Äì4. BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System (TARDIS), a multi-function display, to replace the rear cockpit's Combined Radar and Projected Map Display; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004.\\"BAE SYSTEMS Receives $70 Million Contract For Radar Map Display Subsystem On U.K. Tornado Aircraft.\\" BAE Systems, 9 February 2004. The primary flight controls of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue quadruplex Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) connected to a digital Autopilot & Flight Director System (AFDS).Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 2, 23. In addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure.Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 2, 22. To enhance pilot awareness, artificial feel was built into the flight controls, such as the centrally located stick. Because the Tornado's variable wings enable the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude.Moir and Seabridge 2011, p. 17. As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted, the resulting changes to the aircraft's flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system.Pratt 2000, p. 236. A German Air Force Tornado 43+46 undergoing maintenance in July 2004 The Tornado incorporates a combined navigation/attack Doppler radar that simultaneously scans for targets and conducts fully automated terrain- following for low-level flight operations. Being able to conduct all-weather hands-off low-level flight was considered one of the core advantages of the Tornado.Ministry of Defence 2006, p. 18. The Tornado ADV had a different radar system to other variants, designated AI.24 Foxhunter, as it is designed for air defence operations. It was capable of tracking up to 20 targets at ranges of up to . The Tornado was one of the earliest aircraft to be fitted with a digital data bus for data transmission. A Link 16 JTIDS integration on the F3 variant enabled the exchange of radar and other sensory information with nearby friendly aircraft.Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 447‚Äì448.

German Tornado aircrew training took place at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, US from January 1996 when at that time was called Taktische Ausbildungskommando der Luftwaffe USA (TaktAusbKdoLw USA - Tactical Training Command of the Luftwaffe USA) was responsible for training both German F-4 Phantom and Tornado crews. In 1999 the training command was renamed as Fliegerisches Ausbildungszentrum der Luftwaffe (FlgAusbZLw - Luftwaffe Training Center). In March 2015, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen decided to continue this training in Germany. In September 2017, flight training in Holloman for the Tornado was discontinued and transferred to Taktischen Luftwaffengeschwader 51 in Jagel with the US location command dissolved in 2019.

As of March 2020, the Super Hornet is not certified for the B61 nuclear bombs, but Dan Gillian, head of Boeing's Super Hornet program, previously stated that \\"We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [German's] timeline.\\" =German Navy (Marineflieger)= A German Navy Tornado 43+65 landing at RAF Mildenhall in 1984 In addition to the order made by the Luftwaffe, the German Navy's Marineflieger also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missile, which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions, and later by AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missiles. Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.Lake World Air Power Journal Volume 32, p. 132. The end of the Cold War and the signing of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a requirement for Germany to reduce the size of its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the Marineflieger's Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing.Evans 1999, p. 94.Lake World Air Power Journal Volume 32, pp. 129, 132.

In 2000, with major delays hampering the Eurofighter, the Aeronautica Militare began a search for another interim fighter. While the Tornado itself was considered, any long term extension to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and thus was not considered cost effective.

Crew that qualified from the TTTE went onto the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit (TWCU), which formed on 1 August 1981 at RAF Honington, before being posted to a front-line squadron. No. IX (B) Squadron became the first front-line squadron in the world to operate the Tornado when it reformed on 1 June 1982, having received its first Tornado GR1 ZA586 on 6 January 1982.Napier 2017, p. 20. No. IX (B) Squadron was declared strike combat ready to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in January 1983.Napier 2017, p. 23. Two more squadrons were formed at RAF Marham in 1983 ‚Äì No. 617 Squadron on 1 January and No. 27 Squadron on 12 August. The first RAF Tornado GR1 loss was on 27 September 1983 when ZA586 suffered complete electrical failure and crashed. Navigator Flt. Lt. Nigel Nickles ejected while the pilot Sqn. Ldr. Michael Stephens died in the crash after ordering ejection. In January 1984, the TWCU adopted the guise of No. 45 (Reserve) Squadron.Napier 2017, p. 34. RAF Germany (RAFG) began receiving Tornados after the formation of No. XV (Designate) Squadron on 1 September 1983 at RAF Laarbruch followed by No. 16 (Designate) Squadron in January 1984 (who were both Blackburn Buccaneer squadrons).Napier 2017, pp. 33‚Äì34. They were then joined by No. 20 (Designate) Squadron in May 1984 (who were operating the SEPECAT Jaguar GR1 from RAF Br√ºggen).

The Tornado made its combat debut as part of Operation Granby, the British contribution to the Gulf War in 1991. This saw 49 RAF Tornado GR1s deploy to Muharraq Airfield in Bahrain and to Tabuk Air Base and Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia. 18 Tornado F3s were deployed to provide air cover, the threat of their long range missiles being a deterrent to Iraqi pilots, who would deliberately avoid combat when approached.Clark 1993, p. 10. Early on in the conflict, the GR1s targeted military airfields across Iraq, deploying a mixture of unguided bombs in loft-bombing attacks and specialised JP233 runway denial weapons. On 17 January 1991, the first Tornado to be lost was shot down by an Iraqi SA-16 missile following a failed low- level bombing run.Lawrence 2002 On 19 January, another RAF Tornado was shot down during an intensive raid on Tallil Air Base.Lowry 2008, p. 8.

In addition, 10 of the Saudi Tornados were outfitted with equipment for performing reconnaissance missions. The 22 Tornado ADVs were replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon; the retired aircraft were being purchased back by the UK.Cordesman 2007, p. 214. By 2007, both the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile and the ALARM anti-radiation missile that previously equipped the RSAF's Tornados had been withdrawn from service.Cordesman 2007, p. 210. As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, such as the short range air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles.Chuter, Andrew. \\"Saudi Arabia Buys MBDA Missiles.\\" DefenseNews, 19 February 2010. In September 2006, the Saudi government signed a contract worth ¬£2.5 billion (US$4.7 billion) with BAE Systems to upgrade up to 80 RSAF Tornado IDS aircraft to keep them in service until 2020. The first RSAF Tornado was returned to BAE Systems Warton in December 2006 for upgrade under the \\"Tornado Sustainment Programme\\" (TSP) to \\"equip the IDS fleet with a range of new precision-guided weapons and enhanced targeting equipment, in many cases common with those systems already fielded by the UK's Tornado GR4s.\\"Hoyle, Craig. \\"Saudi Arabia reveals progress of Tornado upgrade.\\" Flight International, 18 September 2007. In December 2007, the first RSAF aircraft to complete modernisation was returned to Saudi Arabia.\\"First Upgraded Tornado Re-delivered to Royal Saudi Air Force.\\" AirForces Monthly, February 2008, p. 19. Starting from the first week of November 2009, Saudi Air Force Tornados, along with Saudi F-15s performed air raids during the Shia insurgency in north Yemen. It was the first time since Operation Desert Storm in 1991 that the Royal Saudi Air Force participated in a military operation over hostile territory.\\"Saudis bomb Yemen rebels across border.\\" Associated Press, 5 November 2009. Saudi Air Force Tornados are playing a central role in Saudi- led bombing campaign in Yemen. On 7 January 2018, Houthi fighters claimed to have shot down a Saudi warplane which was conducting air-raids over northern Yemen. According to Saudi reports, the downed aircraft was a Tornado of the Royal Saudi Air Force which was on a combat mission in the skies over Saada province in northern Yemen. Saudi reports said that it was lost for 'technical reasons' and that both crew were rescued. In the night of 14 February 2020, a Saudi Tornado was shot down during close air support mission in support of Saudi allied Yemeni forces in the Yemeni Al Jouf governorate by Houthis. On the day after, the Saudi command confirmed the loss of a Tornado, while video evidence was released showing the downing using a two-stage surface to air missile. Both pilots ejected and were captured by Houthis.https://iranpress.com/en/middle_east-i143899-saudi_coalition_confirms_tornado_pilots_captured_by_yemeni_armed_forces Variants=Tornado IDS= ;Tornado GR1 RAF IDS (interdictor/strike) variants were initially designated the Tornado GR1 with later modified aircraft designated Tornado GR1A, Tornado GR1B, Tornado GR4 and Tornado GR4A. The first of 228 GR1s was delivered on 5 June 1979, and the type entered service in the early 1980s. ;Tornado GR1B The Tornado GR1B was a specialised anti-shipping variant of the GR1, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. 26 aircraft were converted and were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland.Lake World Air Power Journal Volume 30, p. 117. Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's seeker for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.Donald World Air Power Journal Volume 33, p. 105. ;Tornado GR4 The UK Ministry of Defence began studies for a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU) in 1984. The update to GR4 standard, approved in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on lessons learned from the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft later received the CUSP avionics package which integrated the Paveway IV bomb and installed a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B. ;Tornado GR1A/GR4A The GR1A is the reconnaissance variant operated by the RAF and RSAF, fitted with the TIRRS (Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System), replacing the cannon.Evans 1999, pp. 98‚Äì99. The RAF ordered 30 GR1As, 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 as new-builds.Evans 1999, p. 97. When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s, GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard.Lake Air International April 2008, p. 24. The switch from low-level operations to medium/high-level operations means that the internal TIRRS was no longer used.Lake Air International April 2008, p. 28. As the GR4A's internal sensors are no longer essential, the RAF's Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operate both GR4A and GR4 aircraft.\\"II (AC) Squadron History ‚Äì Current.\\" Royal Air Force, Retrieved: 4 December 2011. = Tornado ECR= Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electronic Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. It was first delivered on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and is equipped with anti-radiation AGM-88 HARM missiles. The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods. Further, only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a higher thrust rating.Jackson et al. 1998, p. 241. The German ECRs do not carry a cannon.Davies, Steve. \\"German SEAD: The Tornado ECRs of JaBoG 32.\\" AirForces Monthly, March 2003, p. 32. The RAF used the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR and also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission. =Tornado ADV= The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an interceptor variant of the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle,Haglund 1989, p. 70. but it was not intended as a dogfighter, but rather it was a long-endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers.Eagles 1991, p. 88. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe.Eagles 1991, pp. 88‚Äì91.\\"Turbo-Union: The Power for Peace and Freedom.\\" turbounion.co.uk.

Its lyrics were first written in 1834 under the title \\"Hey, Slovaks\\" (\\"Hej, Slov√°ci\\") by Samuel Tom√°≈°ik and it has since served as the ethnic anthem of the Pan-Slavic movement, organizational anthem of the Sokol physical education and political movement, and the national anthem of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. The song is also considered to be the unofficial second ethnic anthem of the Slovaks. Its melody is based on \\"Mazurek DƒÖbrowskiego\\", which has also been the national anthem of Poland since 1926, but the Yugoslav variation has a slower tempo, is more accentuated, and does not repeat the last four lines as it repeats the last two lines. Etymology In Serbo- Croatian, which used both the Latin and the Cyrillic alphabets, the title \\"Hej, Slaveni\\" was written: *Hej, Slaveni or Hej, Sloveni (in Latin) * (in Serbian Cyrillic). In Macedonian the song's title is \\"Ej, Sloveni\\" (Cyrillic: ), and in Slovene, it is \\"Hej, Slovani\\". The original title in Slovak was \\"Hej, Slov√°ci\\". Slovakia The song was written by the Slovak Lutheran pastor, poet and historian Samuel Tom√°≈°ik while he was visiting Prague in 1834. He was appalled that German was more commonly heard in the streets of Prague than Czech. He wrote in his diary: :\\"If mother Prague, the pearl of the Western Slavic world, is to be lost in a German sea, what awaits my dear homeland, Slovakia, which looks to Prague for spiritual nourishment? Burdened by that thought, I remembered the old Polish song Jeszcze Polska nie zginƒô≈Ça, kiedy my ≈ºyjemy (\\"Poland has not yet perished as long as we live.\\"). That familiar melody caused my heart to erupt with a defiant Hej, Slov√°ci, e≈°te na≈°a slovensk√° reƒç ≈æije (\\"Hey, Slovaks, our Slovak language still lives\\")... I ran to my room, lit a candle and wrote down three verses into my diary in pencil. The song was finished in a moment.\\" (Diary of Samuel Tom√°≈°ik, Sunday, 2 November 1834) 1848 Prague Slavic Congress,–í–∏–ª–∏–Ω–±–∞—Ö–æ–≤ –ì. –í. –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–¥–∏–∫–∞ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏: –¢–µ–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞ which was also the Yugoslav national flag from 1918 to 1941. He soon altered the lyrics to include all Slavs and \\"Hey, Slavs\\" became a widely known rallying song for Slav nationalism and Pan- Slavic sentiment, especially in the West Slavic lands governed by Austria. It was printed in numerous magazines and calendars and sung at political gatherings, becoming an unofficial anthem of the Pan-Slavic movement. Its popularity continued to increase when it was adopted as the organizational anthem of the Sokol (\\"falcon\\") physical education movement, which was based on Pan-Slavic ideals and active across Austria-Hungary. In 1905, the erection of a monument to the Slovene poet France Pre≈°eren in Ljubljana was celebrated by a large gathering of people singing \\"Hey, Slavs\\". During the First World War, the song was often used by Slavic soldiers from opposite sides of the front line to communicate common nationalist sentiment and prevent bloodshed. In Slovakia, the song \\"Hey, Slovaks\\" has been considered the unofficial ethnic anthem of the Slovaks throughout its modern history, especially at times of revolution. Although after the First World War the song \\"Nad Tatrou sa bl√Ωska\\" became the official Slovak part in the national anthem of Czechoslovakia and then again in 1993 in anthem of independent Slovakia, \\"Hey, Slovaks\\" is still considered a \\"second\\" national anthem by many (usually more nationalistic) people. Contrary to popular assumption, there was no official state anthem of the clerofascist Slovak Republic (1939‚Äì45), though \\"Hej, Slov√°ci\\" was used by the ruling party. Slovak variant Hej, Slov√°ci, e≈°te na≈°a slovensk√° reƒç ≈æije, Dokiaƒæ na≈°e vern√© srdce za n√°≈° n√°rod bije. ≈Ωije, ≈æije, duch slovensk√Ω, bude ≈æi≈• naveky, Hrom a peklo, m√°rne va≈°e proti n√°m s√∫ vzteky!

English translation Hey, Slovaks, there still lives the Slovak language As long as our faithful heart beats for our nation! There lives, lives, lives the Slovak spirit, it will live for ages! Thunder and Hell, in vain are your rages against us! God entrusted to us our language our thunderwielding god. Therefore, it must not be ripped from us, by anyone in the world! Let there be as many devils, as there are people in the world God is with us: who's against us, will by Perun be swept Even if a tremendous storm rises above us, The stone cracks, the oak breaks, and the earth quakes! We will stand always firm like the castle walls, To pits of the black earth be damned whom betrays treacherously! Yugoslavia \\"Hey, Slavs\\" played by a music box. The first appearance of \\"Hey, Slavs\\" in Yugoslavia was during the Illyrian movement. Dragutin Rakovac translated the song, naming it \\"Hey, Illyrians\\" (). Until the Second World War, the translation did not undergo many changes, except that the Illyrians became Slavs. In 1941 the Second World War engulfed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Axis powers invaded in early April, and the Yugoslav royal army disintegrated and capitulated in just two and a half weeks. Since the old Yugoslav anthem included references to king and kingdom, the anti-royalist Partisan resistance led by Josip Broz Tito and his Communist party decided to avoid it and opted for \\"Hey, Slavs\\" instead. The song was sung at both the first and second sessions of AVNOJ, the legislative body of the resistance, and it gradually became the de facto national anthem of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (new Yugoslavia). The old state anthem was officially abandoned after liberation in 1945, but no new national anthem to replace it was officially adopted. There were several attempts to promote other, more specifically Yugoslav songs as the national anthem, but none gained much public support and \\"Hey, Slavs\\" continued to be used unofficially. The search for a better candidate continued up to 1988, while in 1977 the law only named the national anthem as \\"Hey, Slavs\\" as a temporary state anthem until a new one was adopted. \\"Hey, Slavs\\", under its Serbo-Croatian title \\"\\", was the national anthem of Yugoslavia for 48 years, from 1943 to 1992. With the formal adoption (inauguration) of Amendment IX to the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the song \\"Hey, Slavs\\" gained constitutional sanction as the national anthem on November 25, 1988. After the 43 years of continued use as the de facto national anthem, the delegates simply brought the law in line with custom.Amandmani IX do XLVII na Ustav Socijalistiƒçke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije, \\"Slu≈æbeni list SFRJ\\", br. 70/88, No. 932, pp. 1793-1806 Serbo-Croatian Hej Slaveni, jo≈°te ≈æivi R[ij]eƒç (duh) na≈°ih d[je]dova Dok za narod srce b[ije] Njihovih sinova ≈Ωivi, ≈æivi duh slavenski ≈Ωivjet ƒáe v[je]kov'ma ùÑÜ Zalud pr[ije]ti ponor pakla Zalud vatra groma ùÑá Nek se sada i nad nama Burom sve raznese St[je]na puca, dub se lama Zemlja nek se trese Mi stojimo postojano Kano klisurine ùÑÜ Proklet bio izdajica Svoje domovine! ùÑá Cyrillic script –•–µ—ò –°–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏, —ò–æ—à—Ç–µ –∂–∏–≤–∏ –†–µ—á (–¥—É—Ö) –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö –¥–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞ –î–æ–∫ –∑–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥ —Å—Ä—Ü–µ –±–∏—ò–µ –ä–∏—Ö–æ–≤–∏—Ö —Å–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –ñ–∏–≤–∏, –∂–∏–≤–∏ –¥—É—Ö —Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ñ–∏–≤–µ—õ–µ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤'–º–∞ ùÑÜ –ó–∞–ª—É–¥ –ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–Ω–æ—Ä –ø–∞–∫–ª–∞, –ó–∞–ª—É–¥ –≤–∞—Ç—Ä–∞ –≥—Ä–æ–º–∞ ùÑá –ù–µ–∫' —Å–µ —Å–∞–¥–∞ –∏ –Ω–∞–¥ –Ω–∞–º–∞ –ë—É—Ä–æ–º —Å–≤–µ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–µ—Å–µ –°—Ç–µ–Ω–∞ –ø—É—Ü–∞, –¥—É–± —Å–µ –ª–∞–º–∞, –ó–µ–º—ô–∞ –Ω–µ–∫' —Å–µ —Ç—Ä–µ—Å–µ –ú–∏ —Å—Ç–æ—ò–∏–º–æ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—ò–∞–Ω–æ –ö–∞–Ω–æ –∫–ª–∏—Å—É—Ä–∏–Ω–µ, ùÑÜ –ü—Ä–æ–∫–ª–µ—Ç –±–∏–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—ò–∏—Ü–∞ –°–≤–æ—ò–µ –¥–æ–º–æ–≤–∏–Ω–µ! ùÑá English translation Hey, Slavs, there still lives the word (spirit) of our grandfathers While for the nations beats the heart of their sons!

Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá wanted to adopt ‚ÄúHey, Slavs‚Äù as the Serbian anthem, but the Main Board of the Socialist Party of Serbia overruled it, feeling that it was inappropriate to reuse it after having assigned it to Yugoslavia, thus they assigned Serbia ‚ÄúMarch on the Drina‚Äù instead. The FRY was renamed to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 and was expected to adopt a new national anthem, but since no agreement over state symbols could be reached, \\"Hey, Slavs\\" remained the national anthem of the state union. Many Serbs disliked the song already during this period and booed it whenever it was played at sporting events, like football matches. A hybrid of the Montenegrin folk song (now national anthem) \\"Oj, svijetla majska zoro\\" with the former (now current) Serbian national anthem, \\"Bo≈æe Pravde\\" in alternating verses was proposed (similarly to Czechoslovakia, whose anthem consisted of the Czech part \\"Kde domov m≈Øj\\" and the Slovak part \\"Nad Tatrou sa bl√Ωska\\"). However, this attempt was struck down after objections by the People's Party of Montenegro and the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro. Also proposed was the former Montenegrin national anthem and patriotic song \\"Onamo, 'namo\\", however this also fell through and \\"Hey, Slavs\\" remained the national anthem. Since Montenegro and Serbia dissolved their union and split to become sovereign states in 2006, this issue is moot, as \\"Hey, Slavs\\" is no longer used as an official national anthem by any sovereign state. In a way, \\"Hey, Slavs\\" ended up outliving the countries that used it, as the last instance of it being officially played as part of an event was at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where the Serbia and Montenegro national football team participated despite the country they were playing for no longer existing (having disbanded a few days before the tournament began). Even after the end of the federation, \\"Hey, Slavs\\" is sometimes still mistakenly played by organizers of sports events that involve Serbian teams as a guest side. Notable recent performances, some of which were intentional, include the 2013 UEFA U-19 Championship semi-final football match between Serbia and Portugal as well as the Olympiacos‚ÄìPartizan ULEB Champions league basketball game in 2010.'Grci namerno pustili himnu ‚ÄûHej, Sloveni\\"?' In 2015, French organizers of 2015 European Touring Car Cup season erroneously played \\"Hey, Slavs\\" when Serbian racing driver Du≈°an Borkoviƒá won 1st place at Circuit Paul Ricard. In popular culture The Yugoslav band Bijelo Dugme recorded a version of the song for their 1984 self-titled album. The Yugoslav and Slovenian band Laibach recorded an electronic version of the song, with lyrics in both English and Slovene, for their 2006 album Volk. The song is also featured in the 2002 Slovenian film Headnoise.

It is the third play in his now completed A Currency Trilogy of which the first play is The Inn at the Beginning of the World. The second play is The Beast and the Beauty produced by the Old Mill Theatre, Perth, on 22 June 2012. Plot The plot revolves around the comfortable relationship between widower Harry and his gay son Jeff and their individual searches for the right mate. Harry unconditionally loves his rugby-playing son and even takes an active part in Jeff's search for Mr. Right. Harry reveals that his mother (Jeff's grandmother) was a lesbian, perhaps accounting for his accepting attitude toward Jeff. Jeff's new boyfriend, Greg, who is closeted from his own homophobic father, finds it difficult to relate to Harry's well-meaning matchmaking ways. Greg is ejected from his own home by his father when he discovers his son's sexuality. Harry, via a video dating service, finds a woman that he likes, a divorcee named Joyce, who may not be so understanding after spying a gay magazine in Harry and Jeff's house. Unfortunately, Harry suffers a massive stroke and is left unable to speak or walk. Jeff cares for him as best as he can, taking him to the park for an outing one day. Jeff and Greg meet up in the park and agree to try and rekindle their romance, while Jeff's father, although unable to speak, gives his overwhelming approval. Production The play, directed by Kevin Dowling, opened on October 16, 1990 at the Off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, where it ran for 335 performances. Tony Goldwyn and Richard Venture headed the cast. The play won the Outer Critics Circle Award for the Outstanding Off- Broadway Play 1990‚Äì1991. The first production in Australia was in 1992 by the Sydney Theatre Company at the Wharf Studio Theatre with Ron Graham and Peter Phelps. A new production is touring capital cities, regional and remote venues across Australia in 2011.

His co-authorship of a popular autobiography, The Untouchables, which was released shortly after his death, launched several television and motion picture portrayals that established Ness's posthumous fame as an incorruptible crime fighter. Early life Eliot Ness was born on April 19, 1903, in the Kensington neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. He was the youngest of five children born to Peter Ness (1850‚Äì1931) and Emma King (1863‚Äì1937). His parents, both Norwegian immigrants, operated a bakery. Ness attended Christian Fenger High School in Chicago. He was educated at the University of Chicago, graduating in 1925 with a degree in political science and business administration, and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He began his career as an investigator for the Retail Credit Company of Atlanta assigned to the Chicago territory, where he conducted background investigations for the purpose of credit information. In 1929, he returned to the university to take a graduate course in criminology taught by August Vollmer, a noted police reformer and chief of the Berkeley Police Department. Vollmer's ideas about professionalizing law enforcement would influence Ness throughout his career. Career=1926‚Äì1931= Ness's brother-in-law, Alexander Jamie, an agent of the Bureau of Investigation (which became the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935), influenced Ness to enter law enforcement. Ness joined the U.S. Treasury Department in 1926, working with the 1,000-strong Bureau of Prohibition in Chicago.Biography of Eliot Ness (Essortment) In March 1930, attorney Frank J. Loesch of the Chicago Crime Commission asked President Herbert Hoover to take down Al Capone. Agents of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, working under Elmer Irey and Special Agent Frank J. Wilson of the Intelligence Unit, were already investigating Capone and his associates for income tax evasion. In late 1930, Attorney General William D. Mitchell, seeking a faster end to the case, implemented a plan devised by President Hoover for sending a small team of Prohibition agents, working under a special United States attorney, to target the illegal breweries and supply routes of Capone while gathering evidence of conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act (informally known as the Volstead Act). U.S. attorney George E.Q. Johnson, the Chicago prosecutor directly in charge of both the Prohibition and income tax investigations of Capone, chose the 27-year-old Ness (now assigned to the Justice Department) to lead this small squad. With corruption of Chicago's law enforcement agents endemic, Ness went through the records of all Prohibition agents to create a reliable team (initially of six, eventually growing to about ten) later known as \\"The Untouchables.\\" Raids against illegal stills and breweries began in March 1931. Within six months, Ness's agents had destroyed bootlegging operations worth an estimated $500,000 and representing an additional $2 million in lost income for Capone; their raids would ultimately cost Capone in excess of $9 million in lost revenue. The main source of information for the raids was an extensive wiretapping operation. Failed attempts by members of the Chicago Outfit to bribe or intimidate Ness and his agents inspired Charles Schwarz of the Chicago Daily News to begin calling them \\"untouchables\\". George Johnson adopted the nickname and promoted it to the press, establishing it as the squad's unofficial title. The efforts of Ness and his team inflicted major financial damage on Capone's operations and led to his indictment on five thousand violations of the Volstead Act in June 1931. But federal judge James H. Wilkerson prevented that indictment from coming to trial, instead pursuing the tax evasion case built by George Johnson and Frank Wilson. On October 17, 1931, Capone was convicted on three of 22 counts of tax evasion. He was sentenced to eleven years in prison and, following a failed appeal, began his sentence in 1932. On May 3, 1932, Ness was among the federal agents who took Capone from the Cook County Jail to Dearborn Station, where he boarded the Dixie Flyer to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary--the only time both men are known to have met in person. =1932‚Äì1957= Marker at Lake View Cemetery In 1932, Ness was promoted to Chief Investigator of the Prohibition Bureau for Chicago. Following the end of Prohibition in 1933, he was assigned as an alcohol tax agent in the \\"Moonshine Mountains\\" of southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and in 1934 he was transferred to Cleveland, Ohio. In December 1935, Cleveland mayor Harold H. Burton hired Ness as the city's Safety Director, which put him in charge of both the police and fire departments. Ness soon began a groundbreaking reform program inspired by the ideas of August Vollmer, which focused on professionalizing and modernizing the police, stopping juvenile delinquency, and improving traffic safety. He declared war on the mob, and his primary targets included \\"Big\\" Angelo Lonardo, \\"Little\\" Angelo Scirrca, Moe Dalitz, John Angerola, George Angersola, and Charles Pollizi. Billboard for Eliot Ness's 1947 campaign for mayor, seen in 1973 Ness was also Safety Director at the time of several grisly murders that occurred in the Cleveland area from 1935 to 1938; though he had oversight of the police department, he was only peripherally involved in the investigation. Ness was the one who interrogated one of the prime suspects of the murders, Dr. Francis E. Sweeney, using a polygraph test. At one point in time, two bodies of the victims of the serial killer were placed within view of his office window. \\"Haunted History ‚Äì Season 1 Episode 6 The Torso Murders\\" In 1938, Ness and his wife Edna divorced. His otherwise remarkably successful career in Cleveland withered gradually. He especially fell out of favor after he had the city‚Äôs large shantytowns evacuated and burned during the Cleveland Torso Murders. Cleveland critics targeted his divorce, his high-profile social drinking, and his conduct in a car accident one night when he was driving drunk. Although there were no victims in the accident, Ness, fearful that he might lose his job, tried to get the accident covered up. Later, his involvement in the accident was revealed by a local newspaper and calls for his resignation increased; however, Burton's successor as mayor, Frank Lausche, kept Ness on. In 1939 Ness married illustrator Evaline Michelow. In 1942 the Nesses moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the federal government. He directed the battle against prostitution in communities surrounding military bases, where venereal disease was a serious problem. Later he made a number of forays into the corporate world, all of which failed owing to his lack of business acumen. In 1944, he left to become chairman of the Diebold Corporation, a security safe company based in Ohio. After his second divorce and third marriage, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Cleveland in 1947, after which he left Diebold in 1951. In the aftermath, Ness was forced into taking various odd jobs to earn a living, including bookstore clerk and wholesaler of electronics parts and frozen hamburger patties. By 1956, he came to work for a startup company called Guaranty Paper Corporation, which claimed to have a new method of watermarking legal and official documents to prevent counterfeiting. Ness was offered the job because of his expertise in law enforcement and moved from Cleveland to Coudersport, Pennsylvania, where much of the investment capital for the company was located. Now drinking more heavily, Ness spent some free time in a local bar, telling stories of his law enforcement career. Guaranty Paper began to fall apart when it became clear that one of Ness's business partners had misrepresented the nature of their supposedly proprietary watermarking process, leaving Ness in serious financial jeopardy. Later life In 1931, a member of Al Capone's gang promised Ness that two $1,000 notes () would be on his desk every Monday morning if he turned a blind eye to their bootlegging activities. Ness refused the bribe and in later years struggled with money; he died nearly penniless at the age of 54. Ness and his role in bringing down Al Capone had been largely forgotten at the time of his death in 1957. His heroic reputation underwent a resurgence with the posthumous publication of the 1957 book he had co-written with Oscar Fraley and the 1959 and 1993 television series, 1987 film, and related media adapted from it. Personal life Ness was married to Edna Stahle from 1929 to 1938, illustrator Evaline Michelow (1911‚Äì1986) from 1939 to 1945, and artist Elisabeth Andersen Seaver (1906‚Äì1977) from 1946 until his death in 1957. He also had an adopted son, Robert (1946‚Äì1976). Death Ness collapsed and died at his home in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, of a massive heart attack on May 16, 1957; he was 54. His ashes were scattered in one of the small ponds on the grounds of Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. An admirer later donated a plot near the pond and erected a cenotaph in his honor there. Ness was survived by his widow, Elisabeth Andersen Seaver, and adopted son, Robert. Legacy=Archive= The Western Reserve Historical Society houses additional Ness papers, including a scrapbook (1928‚Äì1936), copies of newspaper clippings (1935‚Äì1950), a typewritten manuscript detailing Ness's career in Chicago, and miscellaneous papers, including a report on the Fidelity Check Corporation and Guaranty Paper, of which Ness was president. =Art, entertainment, and media= Numerous media works have been developed based on Eliot Ness's life and the legend surrounding his work in Chicago. The first of these resulted in Ness's last years in collaboration with Oscar Fraley in writing the book The Untouchables (1957), which was published after Ness's death and went on to sell 1.5 million copies. Although the historical veracity of this book has been questioned, later research suggests that it is broadly accurate. A 21-page manuscript that Ness wrote for the book is housed in the archives of the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, Ohio. The book was adapted in multiple media and inspired many additional works. The best-known eponymous adaptations include the 1959 TV series The Untouchables starring Robert Stack as Ness and narrated by Walter Winchell and the 1987 film The Untouchables by Brian De Palma starring Kevin Costner as Ness and featuring Sean Connery and Robert De Niro. These two fictionalized portrayals, more than actual history, have inspired numerous novels; a TV-movie, The Return of Eliot Ness, in which Stack returned to the role; a second, short-lived 1993 TV series titled The Untouchables; stage plays such as Peter Ullian's In the Shadow of the Terminal Tower; and comic books such as Torso. Ness was portrayed by actor Jim True-Frost in the fifth season episode \\"The Good Listener\\" of the HBO television series Boardwalk Empire. Max Allan Collins used Ness as the \\"police contact/best friend\\" character in his series of historical private eye novels featuring Chicago detective Nate Heller. Later he spun Ness off into his own series, set during his tenure as Cleveland's Public Safety Director. The first book, The Dark City (1987), depicted Ness's getting hired and undertaking a cleanup of the graft-ridden police force; the second, Butcher's Dozen (1988), his pursuit of the serial killer known as the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run. Bullet Proof (1989) pitted Ness against labor racketeers intent on taking over Cleveland's food service industry. Murder by the Numbers (1993) depicted Ness's investigation of the numbers racket in Cleveland. All of these novels, while fictionalized, were closely based on actual cases investigated by Ness and the Cleveland Police. Collins also wrote a one-man stage play, Eliot Ness - An Untouchable Life, which was nominated for an Edgar award. In 2018, Collins collaborated with historian A. Brad Schwartz on a nonfiction dual biography of Ness and Capone entitled Scarface and the Untouchable: Al Capone, Eliot Ness, and the Battle for Chicago. Collins and Schwartz are currently writing a second volume about Ness's years in Cleveland, entitled The Untouchable and the Butcher. =Beer= Cleveland- based Great Lakes Brewing Company, which claims several connections to Ness (including the brewery owners' mother having worked as his stenographer), named an amber lager \\"Eliot Ness\\" and included several subtle nods to his career in the beer description and label art. =Proposed building naming= On January 10, 2014, Illinois U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown proposed naming the headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Washington, D.C., after Ness. If approved, it would have been called the Eliot Ness ATF Building. Brown said in a statement: \\"Eliot Ness is perhaps best known as the man who helped to bring Al Capone to justice. But Eliot Ness was more than just a Chicago U.S. prohibition agent. He fought for law and justice in Ohio, and fought for peace and freedom in World War II. He was a public servant and an American hero who deserves to be remembered.\\" Chicago Aldermen Edward M. Burke (14th Ward) and James Balcer (11th Ward) opposed the resolution in an article in the Chicago Tribune. In a news release, Burke said: \\"Eliot Ness had a checkered career after leaving the federal government. I simply do not think his image matches the actual reality of his legacy.\\" The authors of two separate Ness biographies later disputed the accuracy of Burke's claims, suggesting he mischaracterized Ness's career. \\"If Hollywood has given Eliot Ness too much credit for getting Capone,\\" Max Allan Collins wrote in an article for HuffPost, \\"he has received too little credit anywhere else for helping professionalize law enforcement in the mid-20th Century.\\" Although the Senate resolution was never adopted, the main atrium in the ATF headquarters building was later renamed for Eliot Ness and features a historical exhibit about the Untouchables. =Festival and museum= Coudersport, Pennsylvania, the town where Ness spent his final months and died, has held an annual \\"Eliot Ness Festival\\" every third weekend in July since 2018. Past events have included a public reunion of people descended from the original Untouchables, a dramatization of Al Capone's trial, film screenings, author talks, and antique car shows. In 2019, an \\"Eliot Ness Museum\\" inspired by the annual festival opened in downtown Coudersport, featuring several antique cars and exhibits describing Ness's life and career.

It was published in 1997. Plot With the opening of the novel, the island of Leshp, which had been submerged under the Circle Sea for centuries, rises to the surface. Its position, exactly halfway between Ankh- Morpork and Al Khali (the capital of Klatch), makes the island a powerful strategical point for whoever lays claim to it, which both cities do. In Ankh- Morpork, a Klatchian Prince named Khufurah is parading through Ankh-Morpork, where he will be presented with a Degree in Sweet Fanny Adams (Doctorum Adamus cum Flabello Dulci), but an assassination attempt occurs, and the Prince is wounded. Sir Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, begins investigating the crime, originally suspecting both a Klatchian named 71-Hour Ahmed and a senior Morporkian peer, Lord Rust, of being involved. The attempted assassination breaks off relations between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch as Prince Khufurah's brother, Prince Cadram, effectively declares war on the city of Ankh-Morpork. At this point, Havelock Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh- Morpork, resigns‚Äîapparently of his own free will‚Äîand Lord Rust takes command of the city. Vetinari has refused to become involved in the war with Klatch, due to the fact Ankh-Morpork does not have an army to stand against any opposing forces (the reason given being that killing enemy soldiers makes it difficult to sell them things afterwards), but Rust declares Martial law and orders the city's noble families to revive their old private regiments. Vimes, refusing to follow Rust, stands down as Commander of the Watch. Captain Carrot resigns as well, as do Sergeant Colon, Sergeant Detritus and Corporal Angua. The idea of putting the watch under the command of Corporal Nobbs is rejected by the ruling Council of Guild leaders and the Watch is disbanded. Vimes then recruits the Watch into his own private army regiment, reasoning that, as an official noble, he is entitled to do so by law and by Lord Rust's command, with the group remaining independent as knights legally fall under command of the king or his duly appointed representatives, neither of which exist in Ankh-Morpork. Angua, following 71-Hour Ahmed, is captured by the Klatchians and taken to Klatch. Carrot, rather than rush off to save her, reports back to Vimes, who gets his private army to head for Klatch. Meanwhile, Nobby and Sergeant Colon have been recruited by Vetinari and his pet inventor, Leonard of Quirm, on a secret mission of their own, unknown to Vimes. Vetinari, Leonard of Quirm, Colon, and Nobby end up in Leonard's \\"Going-Under-the-Water- Safely Device\\" and discover that Leshp is actually floating on top of a huge bubble of gas, and that the gas is escaping from said bubble, meaning that Leshp will, ultimately, sink back under the sea again. Vimes catches up with 71-hour Ahmed and has, by this time, figured out that Ahmed is a fellow policeman. Ahmed tells Vimes that Prince Cadram was responsible for the assassination attempt on Prince Khufurah. Ahmed and his band of Klatchian D'regs and Vimes' army head towards Gebra, in Klatch, where the war is due to start. To help blend in, Vetinari, Nobby and Fred Colon get hold of some Klatchian clothing, though Nobby ends up wearing the costume of a dancing girl and gets in touch with his feminine side. The three also head to Gebra. Arriving at Gebra they discover that Carrot has convinced the two armies to get together and play a game of football (he has an inflatable football in his backpack for just such an emergency), Vimes is preparing to arrest both Klatchian Prince Cadram and Lord Rust for various breaches of the peace (such as being prepared for war) and 71-hour Ahmed is supporting him. Vetinari prevents an international incident by ostensibly declaring the surrender of Ankh-Morpork and offering war reparations. To be ratified on Leshp in one week. Vetinari is returned to Ankh-Morpork, under arrest and in disgrace, but as Leshp has vanished back under the sea again, the treaty was to be signed in a non-existent territory and thus the charge of treason is invalid. Seeing he has been tricked, and with the people and generals turning against him, Prince Cadram flees, with 71-hour Ahmed in pursuit. His brother Khufurah recovers and resumes control of Klatch. Vimes is informed by Carrot that Vetinari has been \\"reminded\\" that the old rank of Commander was the same as the old rank of Duke. He objects, claiming that only a King can make a Duke, but then realises that Carrot was speaking to Vetinari. Since Carrot is, of course, very much not the King of Ankh-Morpork his reminding of Vetinari is all that is required for Vimes to get his new position and rank. Vimes \\"accidentally\\" loses his \\"dis-organiser\\" (given to him by his wife) which kept giving him incorrect information. It is explained that, had Vimes reacted slightly differently in the beginning‚Äîstaying in Ankh-Morpork rather than attempting to follow Ahmed and rescue Angua‚Äîthe whole history of the Ankh-Morpork v. Klatch war would have gone very differently.

Channing was known for his articulate and impassioned sermons and public speeches, and as a prominent thinker in the liberal theology of the day. His religion and thought were among the chief influences on the New England Transcendentalists although he never countenanced their views, which he saw as extreme. He espoused, especially in his \\"Baltimore Sermon\\" of May5, 1819, given at the ordination of the theologian and educator Jared Sparks (1789‚Äì1866) as the first minister of the newly organized First Independent Church of Baltimore, the principles and tenets of the developing philosophy and theology of Unitarianism, leading to the organization in 1825 of the first Unitarian denomination in America (American Unitarian Association) and the later developments and mergers between Unitarians and Universalists, resulting finally in the Unitarian Universalist Association of America in 1961. Life and work=Early life= Channing, the son of William Channing and Lucy Ellery, was born April7, 1780, in Newport, Rhode Island. He was a grandson of William Ellery (1727‚Äì1820), a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, Deputy Governor of Rhode Island, Chief Justice, and influential citizen. As a child, he was cared for by the formerly enslaved woman Duchess Quamino, who later influenced his views on abolitionism. He became a New England liberal, rejecting the Calvinist doctrines of total depravity and divine election. Channing enrolled at Harvard College at a troubled time, particularly because of the recent French Revolution. He later wrote of these years: Graduating first in his class in 1798, he was elected commencement speaker though he was prohibited by the Harvard College faculty from mentioning the Revolution and other political subjects in his address. =As theologian= Statue of Channing standing on the edge of the Boston Public Garden, in Boston, Massachusetts In opposition to traditional American Calvinist orthodoxy, Channing preferred a gentle, loving relationship with God. He opposed Calvinism for Channing's inner struggle continued through two years during which he lived in Richmond, Virginia, working as a tutor for David Meade Randolph. He came to his definitive faith only through much spiritual turmoil and difficulty. Channing was called as pastor of the Federal Street Church in Boston in 1803, where he remained for the rest of his life. He lived through the increasing tension between religious liberals and conservatives and took a moderate position, rejecting the extremes of both groups. In 1809 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1815 Channing engaged in a noted controversy on the principles of Unitarianism with Samuel Worcester, (1770‚Äì1821). A review of a pamphlet on American Unitarianism (American Unitarianism; or a Brief History of the Progress and Present State of the Unitarian Churches of America), attributed to Jeremiah Evarts, was published in The Panoplist in June 1815. Channing objected to the way Unitarians in the United States were portrayed in the review. Worcester replied to this objection, and an exchange of pamphlets followed. Notwithstanding his moderate position, Channing later became the primary spokesman and interpreter of Unitarianism, after sixteen years at Boston's Federal Street Church. He was invited to come south again to Maryland to preach the ordination sermon of the future noted educator and theologian Jared Sparks (1789‚Äì1866), the first minister (1819‚Äì1823) called to the newly organized congregation (1817) in Baltimore known as the First Independent Church of Baltimore (located at West Franklin and North Charles Streets, in a landmark two-year-old structure designed by noted French √©migr√© architect J. Maximilian M. Godefroy), later known, after a merger with Second Universalist Church in 1935, as the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist), which was forever after known as \\"The Baltimore Sermon\\". The sermon, or address, was given on Wednesday, May5, 1819, and was entitled \\"Unitarian Christianity\\". In it, he explicated the distinctive tenets of the developing Unitarian movement, one of which was the rejection of the Trinity. Other important tenets were the belief in human goodness and the subjection of theological ideas to the light of reason. (The anniversary of the address is celebrated and observed annually by the Maryland churches of the Unitarian Universalist Association and its Joseph Priestley District as \\"Union Sunday\\", with occasional ecumenical guests from other Christian bodies.) In 1828 he gave another famous ordination sermon, entitled \\"Likeness to God\\". The idea of the human potential to be like God, which Channing advocated as grounded firmly in scripture, was seen as heretical by the Calvinist religious establishment of his day. It is in this address that Channing first advocated the possibility for revelation through reason rather than solely from Scripture. American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who \\"took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.\\" Even at the end of his life he adhered to the non-Socinian belief in the preexistence of Christ: =Later years= In later years Channing addressed the topic of slavery although he was never an ardent abolitionist. Channing wrote a book in 1835 entitled Slavery.SLAVERY Channing has, however, been described as a romantic racist.Black Abolitionism: A Quest for Human Dignity, Beverly Eileen Mitchell, pp. 133‚Äì38 He held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and held a belief that once freed, Africans would need overseers. The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness. Furthermore, he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves, and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person's autonomy. Therefore, he often chose to remain separate from organizations and reform movements. This middle position characterized his attitude about most questions although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists. Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England, and America, in the nineteenth century. Toward the end of his life Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British abolition in the British West Indies in 1834 and the absence of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated Caribbean. Channing wrote extensively about the emerging new national literature of the United States, saying that national literature is \\"the expression of a nation's mind in writing\\", and \\"the concentration of intellect for the purpose of spreading itself abroad and multiplying its energy\\".Remarks on National Literature =Death= Grave of William Ellery Channing at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts Channing died in Old Bennington, Vermont, where a cenotaph is placed in his memory.

The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems. An application written using ODBC can be ported to other platforms, both on the client and server side, with few changes to the data access code. ODBC accomplishes DBMS independence by using an ODBC driver as a translation layer between the application and the DBMS. The application uses ODBC functions through an ODBC driver manager with which it is linked, and the driver passes the query to the DBMS. An ODBC driver can be thought of as analogous to a printer driver or other driver, providing a standard set of functions for the application to use, and implementing DBMS-specific functionality. An application that can use ODBC is referred to as \\"ODBC- compliant\\". Any ODBC-compliant application can access any DBMS for which a driver is installed. Drivers exist for all major DBMSs, many other data sources like address book systems and Microsoft Excel, and even for text or comma-separated values (CSV) files. ODBC was originally developed by Microsoft and Simba Technologies during the early 1990s, and became the basis for the Call Level Interface (CLI) standardized by SQL Access Group in the Unix and mainframe field. ODBC retained several features that were removed as part of the CLI effort. Full ODBC was later ported back to those platforms, and became a de facto standard considerably better known than CLI. The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes. History=Before ODBC= The introduction of the mainframe-based relational database during the 1970s led to a proliferation of data access methods. Generally these systems operated together with a simple command processor that allowed users to type in English-like commands, and receive output. The best-known examples are SQL from IBM and QUEL from the Ingres project. These systems may or may not allow other applications to access the data directly, and those that did use a wide variety of methodologies. The introduction of SQL aimed to solve the problem of language standardization, although substantial differences in implementation remained. Since the SQL language had only rudimentary programming features, users often wanted to use SQL within a program written in another language, say Fortran or C. This led to the concept of Embedded SQL, which allowed SQL code to be embedded within another language. For instance, a SQL statement like \`SELECT * FROM city\` could be inserted as text within C source code, and during compiling it would be converted into a custom format that directly called a function within a library that would pass the statement into the SQL system. Results returned from the statements would be interpreted back into C data formats like \`char *\` using similar library code. There were several problems with the Embedded SQL approach. Like the different varieties of SQL, the Embedded SQLs that used them varied widely, not only from platform to platform, but even across languages on one platform ‚Äì a system that allowed calls into IBM's DB2 would look very different from one that called into their own SQL/DS. Another key problem to the Embedded SQL concept was that the SQL code could only be changed in the program's source code, so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify. The SQL market referred to this as static SQL, versus dynamic SQL which could be changed at any time, like the command-line interfaces that shipped with almost all SQL systems, or a programming interface that left the SQL as plain text until it was called. Dynamic SQL systems became a major focus for SQL vendors during the 1980s. Older mainframe databases, and the newer microcomputer based systems that were based on them, generally did not have a SQL-like command processor between the user and the database engine. Instead, the data was accessed directly by the program ‚Äì a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems, or a command line interface or interactive forms system in the case of dBASE and similar applications. Data from dBASE could not generally be accessed directly by other programs running on the machine. Those programs may be given a way to access this data, often through libraries, but it would not work with any other database engine, or even different databases in the same engine. In effect, all such systems were static, which presented considerable problems. =Early efforts= By the mid-1980s the rapid improvement in microcomputers, and especially the introduction of the graphical user interface and data-rich application programs like Lotus 1-2-3 led to an increasing interest in using personal computers as the client-side platform of choice in client-server computing. Under this model, large mainframes and minicomputers would be used primarily to serve up data over local area networks to microcomputers that would interpret, display and manipulate that data. For this model to work, a data access standard was a requirement ‚Äì in the mainframe field it was highly likely that all of the computers in a shop were from one vendor and clients were computer terminals talking directly to them, but in the micro field there was no such standardization and any client might access any server using any networking system. By the late 1980s there were several efforts underway to provide an abstraction layer for this purpose. Some of these were mainframe related, designed to allow programs running on those machines to translate between the variety of SQL's and provide a single common interface which could then be called by other mainframe or microcomputer programs. These solutions included IBM's Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) and Apple Computer's Data Access Language. Much more common, however, were systems that ran entirely on microcomputers, including a complete protocol stack that included any required networking or file translation support. One of the early examples of such a system was Lotus Development's DataLens, initially known as Blueprint. Blueprint, developed for 1-2-3, supported a variety of data sources, including SQL/DS, DB2, FOCUS and a variety of similar mainframe systems, as well as microcomputer systems like dBase and the early Microsoft/Ashton-Tate efforts that would eventually develop into Microsoft SQL Server.McGlinn, Evan (1988), Blueprint Lets 1-2-3 Access Outside Data\\", InfoWorld, vol. 10, no. 14, 4 April 1988, pp. 1, 69 Unlike the later ODBC, Blueprint was a purely code-based system, lacking anything approximating a command language like SQL. Instead, programmers used data structures to store the query information, constructing a query by linking many of these structures together. Lotus referred to these compound structures as query trees. Around the same time, an industry team including members from Sybase (Tom Haggin), Tandem Computers (Jim Gray & Rao Yendluri) and Microsoft (Kyle G) were working on a standardized dynamic SQL concept. Much of the system was based on Sybase's DB-Library system, with the Sybase-specific sections removed and several additions to support other platforms. DB-Library was aided by an industry-wide move from library systems that were tightly linked to a specific language, to library systems that were provided by the operating system and required the languages on that platform to conform to its standards. This meant that a single library could be used with (potentially) any programming language on a given platform. The first draft of the Microsoft Data Access API was published in April 1989, about the same time as Lotus' announcement of Blueprint. In spite of Blueprint's great lead ‚Äì it was running when MSDA was still a paper project ‚Äì Lotus eventually joined the MSDA efforts as it became clear that SQL would become the de facto database standard. After considerable industry input, in the summer of 1989 the standard became SQL Connectivity (SQLC). =SAG and CLI= In 1988 several vendors, mostly from the Unix and database communities, formed the SQL Access Group (SAG) in an effort to produce a single basic standard for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as well, what they called a Call Level Interface (CLI). While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC. The new SQLC \\"gang of four\\", MS, Tandem, DEC and Sybase, brought an updated version of SQLC to the next SAG meeting in June 1990. The SAG responded by opening the standard effort to any competing design, but of the many proposals, only Oracle Corp had a system that presented serious competition. In the end, SQLC won the votes and became the draft standard, but only after large portions of the API were removed ‚Äì the standards document was trimmed from 120 pages to 50 during this time. It was also during this period that the name Call Level Interface was formally adopted. In 1995 SQL/CLI became part of the international SQL standard, ISO/IEC 9075-3.ISO/IEC 9075-3 ‚Äì Information technology ‚Äì Database languages ‚Äì SQL ‚Äì Part 3: Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI) The SAG itself was taken over by the X/Open group in 1996, and, over time, became part of The Open Group's Common Application Environment. MS continued working with the original SQLC standard, retaining many of the advanced features that were removed from the CLI version. These included features like scrollable cursors, and metadata information queries. The commands in the API were split into groups; the Core group was identical to the CLI, the Level 1 extensions were commands that would be easy to implement in drivers, while Level 2 commands contained the more advanced features like cursors. A proposed standard was released in December 1991, and industry input was gathered and worked into the system through 1992, resulting in yet another name change to ODBC. =JET and ODBC= During this time, Microsoft was in the midst of developing their Jet database system. Jet combined three primary subsystems; an ISAM-based database engine (also named Jet, confusingly), a C-based interface allowing applications to access that data, and a selection of driver dynamic-link libraries (DLL) that allowed the same C interface to redirect input and output to other ISAM-based databases, like Paradox and xBase. Jet allowed using one set of calls to access common microcomputer databases in a fashion similar to Blueprint, by then renamed DataLens. However, Jet did not use SQL; like DataLens, the interface was in C and consisted of data structures and function calls. The SAG standardization efforts presented an opportunity for Microsoft to adapt their Jet system to the new CLI standard. This would not only make Windows a premier platform for CLI development, but also allow users to use SQL to access both Jet and other databases as well. What was missing was the SQL parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the C-interface used in Jet. To solve this, MS partnered with PageAhead Software to use their existing query processor, SIMBA. SIMBA was used as a parser above Jet's C library, turning Jet into an SQL database. And because Jet could forward those C-based calls to other databases, this also allowed SIMBA to query other systems. Microsoft included drivers for Excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into SQL-accessible database tables. =Release and continued development= ODBC 1.0 was released in September 1992. At the time, there was little direct support for SQL databases (versus ISAM), and early drivers were noted for poor performance. Some of this was unavoidable due to the path that the calls took through the Jet-based stack; ODBC calls to SQL databases were first converted from Simba Technologies's SQL dialect to Jet's internal C-based format, then passed to a driver for conversion back into SQL calls for the database. Digital Equipment and Oracle both contracted Simba Technologies to develop drivers for their databases as well.\\"Our History\\", Simba Technologies Circa 1993, OpenLink Software shipped one of the first independently developed third-party ODBC drivers, for the PROGRESS DBMS, and soon followed with their UDBC (a cross-platform API equivalent of ODBC and the SAG/CLI) SDK and associated drivers for PROGRESS, Sybase, Oracle, and other DBMS, for use on Unix-like OS (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, etc.), VMS, Windows NT, OS/2, and other OS. Meanwhile, the CLI standard effort dragged on, and it was not until March 1995 that the definitive version was finalized. By then, Microsoft had already granted Visigenic Software a source code license to develop ODBC on non-Windows platforms. Visigenic ported ODBC to a wide variety of Unix platforms, where ODBC quickly became the de facto standard.Sippl, Roger (1996) \\"SQL Access Group's Call-Level Interface\\", Dr. Dobbs, 1 February 1996 \\"Real\\" CLI is rare today. The two systems remain similar, and many applications can be ported from ODBC to CLI with few or no changes.\\"Similarities and differences between ODBC and CLI\\", InfoSphere Classic documentation, IBM, 26 September 2008 Over time, database vendors took over the driver interfaces and provided direct links to their products. Skipping the intermediate conversions to and from Jet or similar wrappers often resulted in higher performance. However, by then Microsoft had changed focus to their OLE DB concept (recently reinstated ), which provided direct access to a wider variety of data sources from address books to text files. Several new systems followed which further turned their attention from ODBC, including ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and ADO.net, which interacted more or less with ODBC over their lifetimes. As Microsoft turned its attention away from working directly on ODBC, the Unix field was increasingly embracing it. This was propelled by two changes within the market, the introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like GNOME that provided a need to access these sources in non-text form, and the emergence of open software database systems like PostgreSQL and MySQL, initially under Unix. The later adoption of ODBC by Apple for using the standard Unix-side iODBC package Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) (which OpenLink Software had been independently providing for Mac OS X 10.0 and even Mac OS 9 since 2001) further cemented ODBC as the standard for cross-platform data access. Sun Microsystems used the ODBC system as the basis for their own open standard, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). In most ways, JDBC can be considered a version of ODBC for the programming language Java instead of C. JDBC-to-ODBC bridges allow Java-based programs to access data sources through ODBC drivers on platforms lacking a native JDBC driver, although these are now relatively rare. Inversely, ODBC-to-JDBC bridges allow C-based programs to access data sources through JDBC drivers on platforms or from databases lacking suitable ODBC drivers. =ODBC today= ODBC remains in wide use today, with drivers available for most platforms and most databases. It is not uncommon to find ODBC drivers for database engines that are meant to be embedded, like SQLite, as a way to allow existing tools to act as front- ends to these engines for testing and debugging.Werner, Christian (2018) \\"SQLite ODBC Driver\\" , 2018-02-24 However, the rise of thin client computing using HTML as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC. Many web development platforms contain direct links to target databases ‚Äì MySQL being very common. In these scenarios, there is no direct client-side access nor multiple client software systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active as it once was. =Version history= Version history: * 1.0: released in September 1992 * 2.0: 1994 * 2.5 * 3.0: 1995, John Goodson of Intersolv and Frank Pellow and Paul Cotton of IBM provided significant input to ODBC 3.0Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft ODBC 3.0 Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide, Volume 1. Microsoft Press. February 1997. () * 3.5: 1997 * 3.8: 2009, with Windows 7 * 4.0: Development announced June 2016 with draft spec on Github Drivers and Managers=Drivers= ODBC is based on the device driver model, where the driver encapsulates the logic needed to convert a standard set of commands and functions into the specific calls required by the underlying system. For instance, a printer driver presents a standard set of printing commands, the API, to applications using the printing system. Calls made to those APIs are converted by the driver into the format used by the actual hardware, say PostScript or PCL. In the case of ODBC, the drivers encapsulate many functions that can be broken down into several broad categories. One set of functions is primarily concerned with finding, connecting to and disconnecting from the DBMS that driver talks to. A second set is used to send SQL commands from the ODBC system to the DBMS, converting or interpreting any commands that are not supported internally. For instance, a DBMS that does not support cursors can emulate this functionality in the driver. Finally, another set of commands, mostly used internally, is used to convert data from the DBMS's internal formats to a set of standardized ODBC formats, which are based on the C language formats. An ODBC driver enables an ODBC-compliant application to use a data source, normally a DBMS. Some non- DBMS drivers exist, for such data sources as CSV files, by implementing a small DBMS inside the driver itself. ODBC drivers exist for most DBMSs, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server (but not for the Compact aka CE edition), Sybase ASE, SAP HANA and DB2. Because different technologies have different capabilities, most ODBC drivers do not implement all functionality defined in the ODBC standard. Some drivers offer extra functionality not defined by the standard. =Driver Manager= Device drivers are normally enumerated, set up and managed by a separate Manager layer, which may provide additional functionality. For instance, printing systems often include functionality to provide spooling functionality on top of the drivers, providing print spooling for any supported printer. In ODBC the Driver Manager (DM) provides these features. The DM can enumerate the installed drivers and present this as a list, often in a GUI-based form. But more important to the operation of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a Data Source Name (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a specific data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same MySQL driver can be used to connect to any MySQL server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the information needed to connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources. The DM also includes the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to ask. All of this is included in the driver and the DSNs. Bridging configurations A bridge is a special kind of driver: a driver that uses another driver-based technology. =ODBC-to-JDBC (ODBC-JDBC) bridges= An ODBC-JDBC bridge consists of an ODBC driver which uses the services of a JDBC driver to connect to a database. This driver translates ODBC function-calls into JDBC method-calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when they lack an ODBC driver for some database but have access to a JDBC driver. Examples: OpenLink ODBC-JDBC Bridge, SequeLink ODBC-JDBC Bridge. =JDBC-to-ODBC (JDBC-ODBC) bridges= A JDBC-ODBC bridge consists of a JDBC driver which employs an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This driver translates JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks a JDBC driver, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Sun Microsystems included one such bridge in the JVM, but viewed it as a stop-gap measure while few JDBC drivers existed (The built-in JDBC-ODBC bridge was dropped from the JVM in Java 8). Sun never intended its bridge for production environments, and generally recommended against its use. independent data-access vendors deliver JDBC-ODBC bridges which support current standards for both mechanisms, and which far outperform the JVM built-in.

This provider translates OLE DB method calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks an OLE DB provider, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Microsoft ships one, MSDASQL.DLL, as part of the MDAC system component bundle, together with other database drivers, to simplify development in COM-aware languages (e.g. Visual Basic). Third parties have also developed such, notably OpenLink Software whose 64-bit OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources filled the gap when Microsoft initially deprecated this bridge for their 64-bit OS.Microsoft, \\"Data Access Technologies Road Map\\", Deprecated MDAC Components, Microsoft \\"ADO Programmer's Guide\\" Appendix A: Providers, Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC, retrieved July 30, 2005.

It has an odor like that of menthol, which is found in mint. Though it is best known as a chemical compound in the spirit absinthe, it is unlikely to be responsible for absinthe's alleged stimulant and psychoactive effects due to the small quantities present. Thujone acts on GABA as an antagonist (opposite to the effects of alcohol). As a competitive antagonist of GABA, thujone alone is considered to be convulsant, though by interfering with the inhibitory transmitter GABA, it may convey stimulating, mood-elevating effects at low doses. It is also used in perfumery as a component of several essential oils. In addition to the naturally occurring (‚àí)-Œ±-thujone and (+)-Œ≤-thujone, two other forms are possible: (+)-Œ±-thujone and (‚àí)-Œ≤-thujone. In 2016, they were found in nature as well, in Salvia officinalis. File:(-)-alpha-Thujon.svg(‚àí)-Œ±-thujone File:Alpha-(+)-Thujon.svg(+)-Œ±-thujone File:Beta-(+)-Thujon.svg(+)-Œ≤-thujone File:Beta-(-)-Thujon.svg(‚àí)-Œ≤-thujone  Sources  Thujone is found in a number of plants, such as arborvitae (genus Thuja, hence the derivation of the name), Nootka cypress, some junipers, mugwort, oregano, common sage, tansy, and wormwood, most notably grand wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio. It is also found in various species of Mentha (mint).  Biosynthesis  The biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) from Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase. Quantitative 13CNMR spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene units used to form thujone in plants are derived from the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP). The reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from GPP are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has GPP as its substrate. GPP (1) first isomerizes to linalyl diphosphate (LPP) (2) and neryl diphosphate (NPP) (3). LPP preferentially forms a delocalized allylic cation-diphosphate (4). The ion-pair intermediate then cyclizes in an electrophilic addition to yield the Œ±-terpinyl tertiary cation (5). The conversion of GPP to alpha-terpinyl cation. The Œ±-terpinyl cation (5) then undergoes a 1,2 hydride shift via a Wagner‚ÄìMeerwein rearrangement, leading to the formation of the terpinen-4-yl cation (6). This cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate (7) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor, (+)-sabinene (8). The conversion of alpha- terpinyl cation to (+)-sabinene From (+)-sabinene (8), the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway: (+)-sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of (+)-sabinol (9-1,2) by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, followed by conversion to (+)-sabinone (10) via a dehydrogenase. Finally, a reductase mediates the conversion to Œ±-thujone (11-1) and Œ≤-thujone (11-2). The isomerism of the (+)-sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants; for instance, in the western redcedar (Thuja plicata), thujone is derived exclusively from the (+)-trans-sabinol intermediate (9-1) whereas in the common garden sage (Salvia officinalis), thujone is formed from the (+)-cis-sabinol intermediate (9-2). Proposed synthesis of thujone from sabinene Pharmacology Research-grade thujone Based on studies that looked only at molecular shape, for many years thujone was thought to act similarly to THC on the cannabinoid receptors;Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe: History in a Bottle. Chronicle Books. p. 152 however, this has since been proven false. Thujone is a GABAA receptor antagonist and more specifically, a GABAA receptor competitive antagonist. By inhibiting GABA receptor activation, neurons may fire more easily, which can cause muscle spasms and convulsions. Thujone is also a 5-HT3 antagonist.Modulation of Ionotropic GABA Receptors by Natural Products of Plant Origin The median lethal dose, or LD50, of alpha-thujone, the more active of the two isomers, in mice, is around 45 mg/kg, with 0% mortality rate at 30 mg/kg and 100% at 60 mg/kg. Mice exposed to the higher dose have convulsions that lead to death within 1 minute. From 30 to 45 mg/kg, the mice experience muscle spasms in the legs, which progress to general convulsions until death or recovery. These effects are in line with other GABA antagonists. Also, alpha-thujone is metabolized quickly in the liver in mice. Pretreatment with GABA positive allosteric modulators like diazepam, phenobarbital, or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 mg/kg. Attention performance has been tested with low and high doses of thujone in alcohol. The high dose had a short-term negative effect on attention performance. The lower dose showed no noticeable effect. Thujone is reported to be toxic to brain, kidney, and liver cells and could cause convulsions if used in too high a dose. Other thujone-containing plants such as the tree arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis) are used in herbal medicine, mainly for their immune-system stimulating effects. Side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety, sleeplessness, and convulsions, which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone. In absinthe Thujone is most famous for being a compound in the spirit absinthe. In the past, absinthe was thought to contain up to 260‚Äì350 mg/l thujone,Absinthism: a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact, Padosch et al. Retrieved Oct. 28, 2006. but modern tests have shown this estimate to be far too high. A 2008 study of 13 pre-ban (1895‚Äì1910) bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 mg/l and averaged 25.4 mg/l Absinthe Myths Finally Laid To RestChemical Composition of Vintage Preban Absinthe with Special Reference to Thujone, Fenchone, Pinocamphone, Methanol, Copper, and Antimony Concentrations A 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with GC-MS, and found that the highest contained 4.3 mg/l thujone.Thujone‚ÄîCause of absinthism? Lachenmeier, Emmert et al. Retrieved Oct. 28, 2006. GC-MS testing is important in this capacity, because gas chromatography alone may record an inaccurately high reading of thujone as other compounds may interfere with and add to the apparent measured amount.Determination of a-/b-Thujone and Related Terpenes in Absinthe using Solid Phase Extraction and Gas Chromatography, Emmert et al. Retrieved Oct. 28, 2006. =History= The compound was discovered after absinthe became popular in the mid-19th century. Dr. Valentin Magnan, who studied alcoholism, tested pure wormwood oil on animals and discovered it caused seizures independent from the effects of alcohol. Based on this, absinthe, which contains a small amount of wormwood oil, was assumed to be more dangerous than ordinary alcohol. Eventually, thujone was isolated as the cause of these reactions. Magnan went on to study 250 abusers of alcohol and noted that those who drank absinthe had seizures and hallucinations. In light of modern evidence, these conclusions are questionable, as they are based on a poor understanding of other compounds and diseases, and clouded by Magnan's belief that alcohol and absinthe were degenerating the French race.Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe: History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. Pg. 101-105 After absinthe was banned, research dropped off until the 1970s, when the British scientific journal Nature published an article comparing the molecular shape of thujone to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive substance found in cannabis, and hypothesized it would act the same way on the brain, sparking the myth that thujone was a cannabinoid.

He is credited by name as composer of 152 Phish original songs, 141 of them as a solo credit, in addition to 41 credits attributed to the band as a whole. In addition to his work with Phish, Anastasio has released 11 solo albums, and been part of several side projects including the Trey Anastasio Band, Oysterhead, Ghosts of the Forest, and Surrender to the Air. Trey has performed his own compositions with the New York Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra, and many others. Anastasio wrote the score for the Broadway musical Hands on a Hardbody, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Original Score at the 67th Tony Awards in 2013. He was also awarded the 2013 Dramatists Guild Frederick Loewe Award for best theatrical score composition. \\\\- Biography Trey's childhood home in Princeton, New Jersey. Anastasio was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and moved to Princeton, New Jersey, when he was three. His father, Ernest Anastasio Jr., was an executive vice president at the Educational Testing Service. His mother, Dina, was a children's book author and editor of Sesame Street Magazine. He grew up with his sister Kristy. Anastasio attended Princeton public schools through the fourth grade, then transferred to Princeton Day School. He graduated from the Taft School along with Steven Pollack, better known as the Dude of Life, who later helped pen such Phish compositions as \\"Suzy Greenberg\\", \\"Fluffhead\\", \\"Run Like An Antelope\\", \\"Slave to the Traffic Light\\", and \\"Dinner and a Movie\\". At Taft, he formed his first two bands, Red Tide and Space Antelope. Anastasio enrolled at UVM as a philosophy major, where he met original Phish bandmates Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon, and Jeff Holdsworth. On December 2, 1983 the group played their first gig at a dance in the Harris-Millis Cafeteria at UVM. The setlist consisted of cover songs, including \\"Long Cool Woman\\" and \\"Proud Mary\\" which was performed twice. The band was very primitive at this time and used hockey sticks as mic stands. After performing one set, Michael Jackson's Thriller album was put on by a party-goer to drown out the band. The band would not return to play but were still paid for the performance. At UVM, he hosted an early morning radio program, Ambient Alarm Clock. While living at home for a semester he attended Mercer County Community College. While there, he reconnected with his childhood friend Tom Marshall, and the pair began a songwriting collaboration and recorded material that would appear on the Bivouac Jaun demo tape. Anastasio met up with childhood friends Tom Marshall, his future writing partner, and Marc Daubert who would officially join Phish as percussionist from September 1984 to February 1985. After seeing a Phish show, pianist Page McConnell joined Phish in the autumn of 1985. Anastasio, along with Jon Fishman, transferred to Goddard College. During this time he began a musical association and close friendship with composer Ernie Stires, who taught him composition, theory, and arranging. While at Goddard, he composed the song cycle The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday as his senior project. These songs became mainstays of the Phish catalog. He graduated from Goddard in 1988. Phish Anastasio is a founding member of the rock band Phish, serving as lead guitarist and vocalist since their inception. Phish is noted for their musical improvisation, extended jams, exploration of a broad range of genres, and original live performances. Formed at the University of Vermont in 1983 (with the current line up solidifying in 1985), the band includes bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon; percussionist, vacuum player, and vocalist Jon Fishman; and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell. Phish performed together for over 20 years, releasing 10 studio albums, before breaking up in August 2004. They reunited in March 2009 for a corresponding tour, released a reunion album Joy and have since resumed performing regularly. =Phish-related projects= *Bivouac Jaun in 1984 was a project featuring Anastasio, Phish lyricist Tom Marshall, and one-time Phish percussionist Marc Daubert. The group recorded a four-track project during Phish's short hiatus in the summer of 1984. Much of the project would be retooled and later featured on the first Phish album,The White Tape, in 1986. *Bad Hat, formed in the spring of 1994, included Jon Fishman on drums, Jamie Masefield on mandolin, and Stacey Starkweather on bass. They casually played improvisational jazz around Burlington, Vermont, for a few months, with the first of several shows at Last Elm Cafe. They billed themselves as \\"the quietest band around\\". *Surrender to the Air was a free jazz ensemble led by Anastasio and featuring Fishman, as well as Marshall Allen, Damon Choice, and Michael Ray (trumpeter) of the Sun Ra Orchestra, John Medeski, Marc Ribot, Oteil Burbridge and several other musicians. The group performed two concerts at the New York City Arts Academy in April 1996 and disbanded shortly thereafter. The concerts, like the group's sole album, consisted of completely improvised music. *Phil Lesh and Friends (commonly referred to as Phil Lesh and Phriends) in 1999 featured Anastasio and Page McConnell, Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh and Donna Jean Godchaux, guitarist Steve Kimock, and drummer John Molo performing three nights of Dead and Phish material at The Warfield in San Francisco. It was the first time members of both Phish and the Dead shared the stage together. On February 12, 2006, Anastasio joined Lesh again for a full show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. He did so again on October 20, 2007 in Glens Falls, New York. *SerialPod is a trio featuring Anastasio, Gordon and Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann. On December 17, 2005, the band performed at the 14th annual Warren Haynes Christmas Jam in Asheville, North Carolina. The group performed a series of Grateful Dead and Phish classics, plus covers from Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Ivan Neville joined the group on keyboards for much of the performance. *A quartet consisting of the Benevento/Russo Duo, Gordon and Anastasio traded opening and closing spots with Phil Lesh and Friends during their co-headlining summer 2006 tour before touring on their own for a number of shows in July 2006. * Ghosts of the Forest is a side project for Anastasio and Fishman, which also features vocalist Jennifer Hartswick, guitarist Celisse Henderson, bassist Tony Markellis, and keyboardist Ray Paczkowski. The group was formed in 2018 and performed a short tour in the spring of 2019. The Ghosts of the Forest album, which is credited to Anastasio as a solo artist, was released on April 12, 2019. Trey Anastasio Band Trey Anastasio Band debuted in 1998 as Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes, as a local band in Vermont fronted by Anastasio, on April 17 of that year at the opening week of the nightclub Higher Ground, co- owned by his brother-in-law. The band debuted a number of songs heard in Anastasio's live performances today, including \\"First Tube\\", \\"Last Tube\\", and \\"Mozambique\\". The Trio in 1999 was an evolution of Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes. Anastasio's first solo tour was with the trio, which included himself, Russ Lawton, and Tony Markellis. Markellis was an early influence on Anastasio and seeing the bassist perform with the Unknown Blues Band was a major reason he decided to attend UVM.Greenhaus, Mike https://jambands.com/features/2018/07/03/twenty-years-later-tony-markellis- talks-tab/ Jambands.com The trio reunited in late 2008 (along with keyboardist Ray Packowski) for a tour of the Northeast United States. The band expanded to a sextet in 2000 with three horn players added to the band (Dave Grippo on alto sax, Jennifer Hartswick on trumpet and tuba, and Andy Moroz on trombone). Some of the music originally performed by the sextet was later seen on his 2002 release, Trey Anastasio. A year later they evolved into The Octet which added Ray Paczkowski on keyboards and Russell Remington on tenor sax and flute; and The Dectet in 2002 through 2004 explored complex arrangements and changes of some songs included on Trey Anastasio, and was an evolved version of the octet, now a ten-piece band with the addition of Peter Apfelbaum on barritone sax and percussion, and Cyro Baptista on percussion. On August 10, 2008, Trey Anastasio and Classic TAB played a set at the All Points West Music & Arts Festival at Liberty State Park in New Jersey. They opened with \\"Sand\\" and played a few other classic Anastasio/Markellis/Lawton compositions (songs that were also later recorded by Phish) including \\"Gotta Jibboo\\" and \\"Heavy Things\\". On the twentieth anniversary of the original Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes show, April 17, 2018, Anastasio, Markellis and Lawton embarked on a tour featuring performances of Anastasio songs previously performed by Phish, such as \\"No Men In No Man's Land\\", \\"Camel Walk\\" and \\"Party Time\\" (written by Jon Fishman). Solo work Anastasio was featured on the album True Love by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.\\"True Love ‚Äì Linear CD Notes\\", Toots and the Maytals. >.

On July 31, Trey released Lonely Trip, a collection of original songs written during the COVID-19 pandemic and recorded at his home studio in New York. The LP was mixed by Bryce Goggin and features lyrical collaborations with Tom Marshall and Scott Herman. Anastasio says the project reminded him of his pre-Phish 4-track home recordings.https://jambands.com/news/2020/07/30/trey-anastasio-announces-new- album-lonely-trip/ Jambands.com Other projects *Space Antelope played from 1982‚Äì1983, featuring Anastasio, The Dude of Life, Doug Parsons (drums, English teacher at the Boys' Latin School of Maryland), Dudley Taft and others. The band performed originals as well as covers from Rush, The Velvet Underground, and others. *Surrender to the Air ‚Äì 1995‚Äì1996; An experimental band, playing long sections of improvisation all connected by segments conducted by Anastasio. The group released a self-titled album in March 1996. It featured several members of the late Sun Ra's big band, the Arkestra, which was (among other modes) an archetypical free jazz ensemble. *The Vermont Youth Orchestra has performed with Anastasio on a number of occasions, including a performance at Carnegie Hall. Anastasio's attraction to complex compositions was apparent on his 2004 release, Seis De Mayo, which included some of his work with the Vermont Youth Orchestra, as well as other smaller ensembles. *Oysterhead ‚Äì A trio that included Primus bassist Les Claypool and The Police drummer Stewart Copeland. The original intention of the band was to play a single concert, on May 4, 2000. The supergroup then released an album in 2001 named The Grand Pecking Order, and toured the United States in the Fall of 2001. The band reunited June 16, 2006 at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. *Dave Matthews & Friends ‚Äì A band formed in 2003 to tour in support of Dave Matthews's solo debut Some Devil. Most of the band, including Anastasio, performed on the album. *70 Volt Parade was Anastasio's rock-based solo band featuring Ray Paczkowski on keyboards, Les Hall on guitar and synthesizers, and Skeeto Valdez on drums. The band was active throughout 2005. *The Grateful Dead featured Anastasio on lead guitar and vocals as part of their final run of five \\"Fare Thee Well\\" 50th anniversary shows in Santa Clara (June 27 and 28, 2015) and Chicago (July 3, 4 and 5, 2015). *Ghosts of the Forest - Featuring Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Jennifer Hartswick, Celisse Henderson, Tony Markellis, and Ray Paczkowski. The band toured April 2019, and the self titled album was released April 12, 2019. Guitar playing style and stage equipment Anastasio has employed the services of his friend, luthier and audio-technician Paul Languedoc (Phish's soundman from 1986‚Äì2004) throughout his career. The highly resonant hollow-body electric guitars built by Languedoc for Anastasio, his Ibanez Tube Screamers, and Ross Compressors are key to his signature tone. Anastasio has several custom Languedoc hollow-body electric guitars, which make use of set maple necks with 24-fret ebony fretboards and dual Seymour Duncan SH-1 '59 humbucker pickups. During Phish's 2018 Halloween \\"musical costume\\" set, Anastasio deviated from his Languedoc guitars and performed with a white Ed O'Brien model Fender Stratocaster. Anastasio's electric guitar technique is largely conventional; he does not typically make use of tapping techniques and does not usually play slide guitar (an example of when he does is in the Oysterhead section of Les Claypool's 5 Gallons of Diesel) but is known to be competent at both techniques. He normally uses a 2.0mm Adamas graphite guitar pick, but does not always do so. Melodically, he often incorporates modes, notably the dorian, mixolydian, and locrian, as well as pentatonic scales. In addition to scales, Anastasio makes abundant use of arpeggios while improvising as well as in his compositional material. Anastasio's guitar influences include Robert Fripp, John McLaughlin, Jerry Garcia, Pat Metheny, Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix. \\\\- \\\\- Effects processors play a crucial role in achieving Anastasio's guitar tone. He uses effects such as two Ibanez TS-9 Tube Screamers (with Analogman's Silver Mod) in sequence, the famous Univibe clone the Black Cat Vibe, and a Ross compressor. He switched to Analogman's Bicompressor around 1998, dropped the compressor from his rig in 2002, and resumed use the Ross Compressor in 2008 when a group of fans who desired the return of Anastasio's \\"signature\\" Ross compressor sound pooled their resources to obtain a vintage Ross Compressor and sent it to Anastasio in an attempt to compel him to return the vintage effect pedal to his rig. \\\\- Anastasio responded through friend and longtime collaborator Tom Marshall's website explaining that he had lost his original Ross Compressor and that he was so touched that people cared about his effects and guitar tone that he would add the gift to his rig in the original configuration where it has remained ever since. He also uses a wah wah pedal (usually a Real McCoy Custom 3 by Geoffrey Teese), a Boomerang phrase sampler, Custom Audio Electronics Super Tremolo, Ibanez DM2000 delay, Alesis Microverb II (set to reverse), Whammy II pitch shifter, as well as a Leslie rotating speaker horn. In 2009, Anastasio added a Nova Repeater (delay). He controls these devices singularly or in batch with a Custom Audio Electronics RS-10 footpedal bank. ( the effects system was hugely changed in late 2017- see treysguitarrig.com for most current info) In the early 1990s, Anastasio employed a custom 2x12 speaker cabinet powered by either a 100W Mesa/Boogie Mark III head or, later, a Custom Audio Electronics 3-channel preamp and Groove Tubes power amp. In mid-1997, he switched to a pair of modified 1965 Fender Deluxe Reverb amps, one serving as a backup. When Phish returned in 2009, Anastasio was back to using the Mesa Boogie MKIII. In 2013 he added a Bogner Shiva amp to his arsenal, which can still be seen on stage as recently as Summer Tour '14, though has not been used much during this tour. Anastasio played three different acoustic guitars by Martin. The first is a D-45E which has East Indian Rosewood sides and back and a solid Sitka Spruce top. In 2005, Martin released a Trey Anastasio signature model acoustic guitar, with a dreadnought body with a curved Venetian cutaway. The guitar also has an Italian alpine spruce top, mahogany sides and a three-piece back with \\"wings\\" of mahogany and a center wedge of flame-figured Hawaiian koa (similar to a D-35). The guitar is finished with a flamed koa headplate and snowflake fingerboard inlays. Martin built only 141 of these guitars, which quickly sold out. As of 2017+, a Martin 1943 D28 is main guitar for standard tuning, Martin 1934 00028 for finger-style/open tunings, 1968 D35 for Drop and slack key tunings. The history of Anastasio's guitars, rig and equipment has been meticulously documented by music writer Ryan Chiachiere on the blog Trey's Guitar Rig. Composition work In college, Anastasio studied composition under composer and arranger Ernie Stires. \\"Guelah Papyrus\\", featured on Phish's major label debut A Picture of Nectar, includes a Stires-influenced fugue instrumental section called \\"The Asse Festival\\" as a bridge between verses. In the early years of Phish, many of Anastasio's compositions were through-composed, intricate and detailed in conception (for example, \\"The Divided Sky\\", \\"You Enjoy Myself\\", \\"The Asse Festival\\", \\"The Squirming Coil\\", \\"Reba\\", \\"Fluff's Travels\\"). Anastasio has used improvisation as the driving force behind simplified songwriting, particularly in the music he has written for his touring and recording projects apart from Phish. Tom Marshall, a New Jersey computer systems professional and friend of Anastasio since his Princeton childhood, has been his primary songwriting collaborator, acting as lyricist. Anastasio has often pulled lyrics for his music from large notebooks of poems and prose kept by Marshall, and the pair have taken working retreats during which they wrote and/or recorded demos of new material. One such demo, Trampled By Lambs and Pecked by the Dove, has been commercially released, and many of the songs included on this release were reincarnated into Phish's 1998 album The Story of the Ghost. Anastasio also writes a number of his own lyrics, including all of the lyrics on his first release with Columbia Records, 2005's Shine. One of Anastasio's signature compositional techniques is the use of episodic (or organic) form. \\"Fluff's Travels\\" and \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" are good examples of through-composed pieces which evolve from one musical idea to the other, never returning to a previous musical statement. This technique had been used in a rock music setting by relatively few before Phish (Frank Zappa and the Grateful Dead are two such examples). Anastasio employs modal improvisation, first made popular by Miles Davis in the late 50s/early 60s. Anastasio has also demonstrated skill at composing chamber music and music for orchestra, most notably on Seis De Mayo, his second solo album, and in his collaborations with the Vermont Youth Orchestra. On September 27, 2008, Anastasio and Orchestra Nashville premiered a new work titled Time Turns Elastic, an original long-form piece that was orchestrated by composer and arranger Don Hart, and featured Anastasio on lead guitar and vocals. Anastasio previously collaborated with Hart and Orchestra Nashville in his orchestral performance of \\"Guyute\\" at Bonnaroo 2004. He performed the same composition at Carnegie Hall with the Vermont Youth Orchestra on September 14, 2004 and with the New York Philharmonic on September 12, 2009. Trey played the Walt Disney Concert Hall accompanied by the Los Angeles Philharmonic on March 10, 2012. Anastasio's 2012 album Traveler was a collaboration with producer Peter Katis, whose longtime band The Philistines Jr. opened for Phish at UVM early in their career.Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/reel- time-trey-anastasio-discusses-traveler10/ Relix Trey was nominated for a 2013 Best Original score Tony Award, an Outstanding New Score Drama Desk Award, and Outstanding Music and Outstanding Orchestrations Outer Critics Circle Awards for the musical Hands on a Hardbody. That year, he also received the Frederick Loewe Award from the Dramatists Guild of America, which recognizes achievement in a theatrical score. Hands on a Hardbody received nine 2012‚Äì2013 Drama Desk Awards, tying for most nominations, and winning in the Best Sound Design in a Musical category. Anastasio co-wrote the music for Hands on a Hardbody (along with Amanda Green) for a Broadway opening in March 2013. After only 56 performances, the show closed on April 13, making it the \\"fastest closing new musical of the season.\\" Media appearances On March 15, 2010, Anastasio inducted one of his favorite bands, Genesis, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, claiming it was \\"impossible to overstate what impact this band and musical philosophy had on me as a young musician. I'm forever in their debt.\\" In addition to Anastasio's speech, Phish appeared and performed two Genesis songs, \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" and \\"No Reply At All\\". Genesis did not perform. In June 2010, Anastasio appeared as a surprise musical guest on Conan O'Brien's \\"The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour\\" stop at the Tower Theater where he performed \\"Alaska.\\" Between Me and My Mind, a documentary film directed by Steven Cantor about Anastasio's musical projects and Phish's 2018 New Year's Eve concert, was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2019. Personal life Trey has been married to Susan Statesir, his college girlfriend, since August 13, 1994. They have two daughters, Eliza and Isabella. \\\\- His sister, Kristy Manning, died of cancer in April 2009. On December 15, 2006, Anastasio was stopped by police in Whitehall, New York, on a traffic violation. He failed a field sobriety test, and was subsequently arrested for possession of heroin and other drugs, and driving while intoxicated. Anastasio pleaded guilty to a reduced felony drug charge and spent 14 months participating in daily meetings, drug testing, and performing community service in the Washington County, New York, drug court program. In June 2008, after completing all phases of the New York State drug court, Anastasio graduated in good standing. His conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor. He has publicly thanked the officer who arrested him for turning his life around. \\\\- Following this experience, he became an active participant in the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP), sharing his story on Capitol Hill, and working to help raise awareness and money, for a National Drug Court. Anastasio has maintained sobriety since January 2007, and detailed his opiate addiction, arrest and rehabilitation in a January 2019 GQ feature on sober musicians. The Barn \\"The Barn\\", also known as \\"The Farmhouse\\", is the name given to Anastasio's rehearsal and recording facility in the countryside near Westford, Vermont in the state's Lamoille Valley region. It was reconstructed between 1996 and 1998 from an existing structure, the Alan Irish Barn. The Barn has been used by Phish and most of Anastasio's projects since 1999. The cover photo of the Phish album Farmhouse is of the outhouse located right next to The Barn. Other artists who have recorded or performed at The Barn include Gordon Stone Band, Herbie Hancock, B√©la Fleck, Swampadelica, John Patitucci, DJ Logic, Toots & the Maytals, Tony Levin, The Slip, RAQ, John Medeski, Jerry Douglas, Nicholas Cassarino, Van Ghost and Addison Groove Project, among others. Beginning in 2006, The Barn was transformed from a commercial recording facility into a studio environment providing accommodations and work space for artists participating in the Seven Below residency program.

Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a secular state (with or without legally explicit church‚Äìstate separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (1992), Kermit D. Hall, Ed. pp. 717‚Äì26 Although the concept is older, the exact phrase \\"separation of church and state\\" is derived from \\"wall of separation between church and state\\", a term coined by Thomas Jefferson. In a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The arm's length principle proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of la√Øcit√© is used in France, while secular societies such as Norway, Denmark, and England maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official state religion. The philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of secularism, disestablishmentarianism, religious liberty, and religious pluralism. By way of these philosophies, the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church and the welfare state, a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and public sphere.Separationism, Princeton University WordNet reads: \\"separationism: advocacy of a policy of strict separation of church and state.\\" In practice, church‚Äìstate separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political constitution, as in India and Singapore, to a state religion, as in the Maldives. History of the concept and term=Late antiquity= St. Augustine by Carlo Crivelli An important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. Augustine, who in The City of God, Book XIX, Chapter 17, examined the ideal relationship between the \\"earthly city\\" and the \\"city of God\\". In this work, Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the \\"earthly city\\" and the \\"city of God\\", especially as people need to live together and get along on earth. Thus, Augustine held that it was the work of the \\"temporal city\\" to make it possible for a \\"heavenly city\\" to be established on earth.Feldman (2009) =Medieval Europe= For centuries, monarchs ruled by the idea of divine right. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as caesaropapism. On the other side was the Catholic doctrine that the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the Pope claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such as was the case with Henry VIII of England and Henry III of Navarre. In the West the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who ruled in the secular sphere but encroached on the Church's rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the Investiture Controversy, which was resolved in the Concordat of Worms in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration. =Reformation= At the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther articulated a doctrine of the two kingdoms. According to James Madison, perhaps one of the most important modern proponents of the separation of church and state, Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state. Antichristus, a woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder of the pope using the temporal power to grant authority to a generously contributing ruler Those of the Radical Reformation (the Anabaptists) took Luther's ideas in new directions, most notably in the writings of Michael Sattler (1490‚Äì1527), who agreed with Luther that there were two kingdoms, but differed in arguing that these two kingdoms should be separate, and hence baptized believers should not vote, serve in public office or participate in any other way with the \\"kingdom of the world\\". While there was a diversity of views in the early days of the Radical Reformation, in time Sattler's perspective became the normative position for most Anabaptists in the coming centuries. Anabaptists came to teach that religion should never be compelled by state power, approaching the issue of church-state relations primarily from the position of protecting the church from the state.Bender, H. S. \\"The Anabaptists and Religious Liberty in the Sixteenth Century.\\" Mennonite Quarterly Review 29 (1955): 83‚Äì100. In the 1530s, Henry VIII, angered by the Pope Clement VII's refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, decided to break with the Church and set himself as ruler of the Church of England. The monarchs of Great Britain have retained ecclesiastical authority in the Church of England since Henry VIII, having the current title, Supreme Governor of the Church of England. England's ecclesiastical intermixing did not spread widely, however, due to the extensive persecution of Catholics that resulted from Henry's power grab. This eventually led to Nonconformism, English Dissenters, and the anti-Catholicism of Oliver Cromwell, the Commonwealth of England, and the Penal Laws against Catholics and others who did not adhere to the Church of England. One of the results of the persecution in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished. After the American Colonies revolted against George III of the United Kingdom, the Constitution of United States was amended to ban the establishment of religion by Congress. = Enlightenment = John Locke, English political philosopher argued for individual conscience, free from state control The concept of separating church and state is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632‚Äì1704).Feldman, Noah (2005). Divided by God. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 29 (\\"It took John Locke to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.\\") According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.Feldman, Noah (2005). Divided by God. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 29 At the same period of the 17th century, Pierre Bayle and some fideists were forerunners of the separation of Church and State, maintaining that faith was independent of reason. During the 18th century, the ideas of Locke and Bayle, in particular the separation of Church and State, became more common, promoted by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. Montesquieu already wrote in 1721 about religious tolerance and a degree of separation between religion and government. Voltaire defended some level of separation but ultimately subordinated the Church to the needs of the State while Denis Diderot, for instance, was a partisan of a strict separation of Church and State, saying \\"the distance between the throne and the altar can never be too great\\". = Wall of Separation = Although often attributed to Thomas Jefferson, the concept of a wall of separation between state and religion can be found within Roger Williams' writings: > When they [the Church] have opened a gap in the hedge or wall of separation > between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world, God hath > ever broke down the wall itself, removed the Candlestick, etc., and made His > Garden a wilderness as it is this day. And that therefore if He will ever > please to restore His garden and Paradise again, it must of necessity be > walled in peculiarly unto Himself from the world, and all that be saved out > of the world are to be transplanted out of the wilderness of the World. > (\\"Mr. Cotton's Letter Lately Printed, Examined and Answered,\\" The Complete > Writings of Roger Williams, Volume 1, page 108 (1644))[1] Williams' beliefs in this regard were not a brand new novelty, but were consistent with earlier ideals worked out by Martin Luther and his Two kingdoms doctrine.[2][3] =Jefferson and the Bill of Rights= Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, whose letter to the Danbury Baptists Association is often quoted in debates regarding the separation of church and state. In English, the exact term is an offshoot of the phrase, \\"wall of separation between church and state\\", as written in Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802. In that letter, referencing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Jefferson writes: > Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & > his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, > that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, > I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people > which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an > establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus > building a wall of separation between Church and State. Jefferson was describing to the Baptists that the United States Bill of Rights prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 as ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States, was one of the earliest political expressions of religious freedom. Others were the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, also authored by Jefferson and adopted by Virginia in 1786; and the French Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789. The metaphor \\"a wall of separation between Church and State\\" used by Jefferson in the above quoted letter became a part of the First Amendment jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was first used by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in Reynolds v. United States (1878). American historian George Bancroft was consulted by Waite in the Reynolds case regarding the views on establishment by the framers of the U.S. constitution. Bancroft advised Waite to consult Jefferson. Waite then discovered the above quoted letter in a library after skimming through the index to Jefferson‚Äôs collected works according to historian Don Drakeman. In various countries Countries have varying degrees of separation between government and religious institutions. Since the 1780s a number of countries have set up explicit barriers between church and state. The degree of actual separation between government and religion or religious institutions varies widely. In some countries the two institutions remain heavily interconnected. There are new conflicts in the post-Communist world. Countries with a state religion. The many variations on separation can be seen in some countries with high degrees of religious freedom and tolerance combined with strongly secular political cultures which have still maintained state churches or financial ties with certain religious organizations into the 21st century. In England, there is a constitutionally established state religion but other faiths are tolerated.Status of religious freedom by country The British monarch is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and 26 bishops (Lords Spiritual) sit in the upper house of government, the House of Lords. In other kingdoms the head of government or head of state or other high-ranking official figures may be legally required to be a member of a given faith. Powers to appoint high-ranking members of the state churches are also often still vested in the worldly governments. These powers may be slightly anachronistic or superficial, however, and disguise the true level of religious freedom the nation possesses. In the case of Andorra there are two heads of state, neither of them native Andorrans. One is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, a town located in northern Spain. He has the title of Episcopalian Coprince (the other Coprince being the French Head of State). Coprinces enjoy political power in terms of law ratification and constitutional court designation, among others. =Australia= alt=A black and white portrait of H. B. Higgins The Constitution of Australia prevents the Commonwealth from establishing any religion or requiring a religious test for any office: The language is derived from the United States' constitution, but has been altered. Following the usual practice of the High Court, it has been interpreted far more narrowly than the equivalent US sections and no law has ever been struck down for contravening the section. Today, the Commonwealth Government provides broad-based funding to religious schools. The Commonwealth used to fund religious chaplains, but the High Court in Williams v Commonwealth found the funding agreement invalid under Section 61. However, the High Court found that Section 116 had no relevance, as the chaplains themselves did not hold office under the Commonwealth. All Australian parliaments are opened with a Christian prayer, and the preamble to the Australian Constitution refers to \\"humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God\\".Preamble to Commonwealth of Australian Constitution Act (Imp.) 1900. Although the Australian monarch is Elizabeth II, also British monarch and Governor of the Church of England, her Australian title is unrelated to her religious office and she has no role in the Anglican Church of Australia. The prohibition against religious tests has allowed former Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Peter Hollingworth to be appointed Governor-General of Australia, the highest domestic constitutional officer; however, this was criticised.Hogan, M. (2001, May 16). Separation of church and state? Australian Review of Public Affairs. Retrieved 2010-10-10. Despite inclusion in the \\"States\\" chapter, Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church (New South Wales restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation... There have been two referenda to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed. In each case the changes were grouped with other changes and voters did not have the opportunity to expressly accept only one change. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the New South Wales act allowing same-sex couples to adopt children permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them.. The current situation, described as a \\"principle of state neutrality\\" rather than \\"separation of church and state\\", has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups. On the one hand, secularists have argued that government neutrality to religions leads to a \\"flawed democrac[y]\\"Wallace, M. (2005). Is there a separation of church and state in Australia and New Zealand? Australian Humanist, 77. Retrieved 2010-10-10. or even a \\"pluralistic theocracy\\"Secular Party of Australia. (nd).

On the other hand, religious groups and others have been concerned that state governments are restricting them from exercising their religion by preventing them from criticising other groups and forcing them to do unconscionable acts.Davidson, S.

Retrieved 2010-10-10 = Azerbaijan = Azerbaijan and its main cities Islam is the dominant religion in Azerbaijan, with 96% of Azerbaijanis being Muslim, Shia being in the majority. However, Azerbaijan is officially a secular state. According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, the state and religion are separate. Article 7 of the Constitution defines the Azerbaijani state as a democratic, legal, secular, unitary republic. Therefore, the Constitution provides freedom of religions and beliefs. The Azerbaijani State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations controls the relations between the state and religions. Ethnic minorities such as Russians, Georgians, Jews, Lezgis, Avars, Udis and Kurds with different religious beliefs to Islam all live in Azerbaijan. Several religions are practiced in Azerbaijan. There are many Orthodox and Catholic churches in different regions of Azerbaijan.https://www.counterextremism.com/sites/default/files/Secularism_in_Azerbaijan_June%202015.pdf = Brazil = Rui Barbosa had a large influence upon the text adopted as the 1891 Constitution of Brazil. Brazil was a colony of the Portuguese Empire from 1500 until the nation's independence from Portugal, in 1822, during which time Roman Catholicism was the official state religion. With the rise of the Empire of Brazil, although Catholicism retained its status as the official creed, subsidized by the state, other religions were allowed to flourish, as the 1824 Constitution secured religious freedom. The fall of the Empire, in 1889, gave way to a Republican regime, and a Constitution was enacted in 1891, which severed the ties between church and state; Republican ideologues such as Benjamin Constant and Ruy Barbosa were influenced by la√Øcit√© in France and the United States. The 1891 Constitutional separation of Church and State has been maintained ever since. The current Constitution of Brazil, in force since 1988, ensures the right to religious freedom, bans the establishment of state churches and any relationship of \\"dependence or alliance\\" of officials with religious leaders, except for \\"collaboration in the public interest, defined by law\\". = Canada = Qu√©bec = China = China, during the era of the Han Dynasty, had established Confucianism as the official state ideology over that of Legalism of the preceding Qin Dynasty over two millennium ago. In post-1949 modern-day China, owing to such historic experiences as the Taiping Rebellion, the Chinese Communist Party had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican for over half a century, and maintained separation of the church from state affairs, and although the Chinese government's methods are disputed by the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI had accepted the ordination of a bishop who was pre-selected by the government for the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association in 2007. However, a new ordination of a Catholic bishop in November 2010, according to BBC News, has threatened to \\"damage ties\\" between China and the Vatican. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China guarantees, in its article 36, that:Constitution of the People's Republic of China (1982) , English translation (page visited on 17 December 2015).  Hong Kong  Macau = Croatia = Constitutional Court and is used on the occasion of the presidential inauguration Freedom of religion in Croatia is a right defined by the Constitution, which also defines all religious communities as equal in front of the law and separated from the state. Principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 41 which states: > All religious communities shall be equal before the law and clearly > separated from the state. Religious communities shall be free, in compliance > with law, to publicly conduct religious services, open schools, academies or > other institutions, and welfare and charitable organizations and to manage > them, and they shall enjoy the protection and assistance of the state in > their activities. Public schools allow religious teaching () in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated. Religion classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. The public holidays also include religious festivals of: Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and Boxing Day. The primary holidays are based on the Catholic liturgical year, but other believers are allowed to celebrate other major religious holidays as well. The Roman Catholic Church in Croatia receives state financial support and other benefits established in concordats between the Government and the Vatican. In an effort to further define their rights and privileges within a legal framework, the government has additional agreements with other 14 religious communities: Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC), Islamic Community of Croatia, Evangelical Church, Reformed Christian Church in Croatia, Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Croatia, Pentecostal Church, Union of Pentecostal Churches of Christ, Christian Adventist Church, Union of Baptist Churches, Church of God, Church of Christ, Reformed Movement of Seventh-day Adventists, Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Macedonian Orthodox Church and Croatian Old Catholic Church. = Finland = The Constitution of Finland declares that the organization and administration of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is regulated in the Church Act, and the organization and administration of the Finnish Orthodox Church in the Orthodox Church Act. The Lutheran Church and the Orthodox Church thus have a special status in Finnish legislation compared to other religious bodies, and are variously referred to as either \\"national churches\\" or \\"state churches\\", although officially they do not hold such positions.Jeroen Temperman, 2010, State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law: Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance, p. 45 The Lutheran Church does not consider itself a state church, and prefers to use the term \\"national church\\". The Finnish Freethinkers Association has criticized the official endorsement of the two churches by the Finnish state, and has campaigned for the separation of church and state.Eroakirkosta.fi ‚Äì Palvelun tavoite: Kirkko on erotettava valtiosta = France = tympanum of a church in Aups, Var d√©partement, which was installed after the 1905 law on the Separation of the State and the Church. Such inscriptions on a church are very rare; this one was restored during the 1989 bicentennial of the French Revolution. The French version of separation of church and state, called la√Øcit√©, is a product of French history and philosophy. It was formalized in a 1905 law providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power. This model of a secularist state protects the religious institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims to protect the public power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy criticised \\"negative la√Øcit√©\\" and talked about a \\"positive la√Øcit√©\\" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups.Beita, Peter B. French President's religious mixing riles critics Christianity Today, January 23, 2008 He visited the Pope in December 2007 and publicly emphasized France's Catholic roots, while highlighting the importance of freedom of thought, advocating that faith should come back into the public sphere. Fran√ßois Hollande took a very different position during the 2012 presidential election, promising to insert the concept of la√Øcit√© into the constitution. In fact, the French constitution only says that the French Republic is \\"la√Øque\\" but no article in the 1905 law or in the constitution defines la√Øcit√©. Nevertheless, there are certain entanglements in France which include: * The most significant example consists in two areas, Alsace and Moselle (see for further detail), where the 1802 Concordat between France and the Holy See still prevails because the area was part of Germany when the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State was passed and the attempt of the laicist Cartel des gauches in 1924 failed due to public protests. Catholic priests as well as the clergy of three other religions (the Lutheran EPCAAL, the Calvinist EPRAL, and Jewish consistories) are paid by the state, and schools have religion courses. Moreover, the Catholic bishops of Metz and of Strasbourg are named (or rather, formally appointed) by the French Head of State on proposition of the Pope. In the same way, the presidents of the two official Protestant churches are appointed by the State, after proposition by their respective Churches. This makes the French President the only temporal power in the world to formally have retained the right to appoint Catholic bishops, all other Catholic bishops being appointed by the Pope. * In French Guyana the Royal Regulation of 1828 makes the French state pay for the Roman Catholic clergy, but not for the clergy of other religions. * In the French oversea departments and territories since the 1939 d√©cret Mandel the French State supports the Churches. * The French President is ex officio a co-prince of Andorra, where Roman Catholicism has a status of state religion (the other co-prince being the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of Canon of the Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour has been awarded to a newly elected president, France pays for a choir vicar, a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral in lieu of the president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her). The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France. * Another example of the complex ties between France and the Catholic Church consists in the Pieux √âtablissements de la France √† Rome et √† Lorette: five churches in Rome (Trinit√† dei Monti, St. Louis of the French, St. Ivo of the Bretons, St. Claude of the Free County of Burgundy, and St. Nicholas of the Lorrains) as well as a chapel in Loreto belong to France, and are administered and paid for by a special foundation linked to the French embassy to the Holy See. * In Wallis and Futuna, a French overseas territory, national education is conceded to the diocese, which gets paid for it by the State * A further entanglement consists in liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist for example in Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places. =Germany= Courtroom with Crucifix in Nuremberg, Germany, June 2016 The German constitution guarantees freedom of religion,Section 4 of German Basic Law but there is not a complete separation of church and state in Germany. Officially recognized religious bodies operate as K√∂rperschaften des √∂ffentlichen Rechts (corporations of public law, as opposed to private). For recognized religious communities, some taxes (Kirchensteuer) are collected by the state;Binder, Gerhard/Wagner, J√ºrgen, Grundwissen Grundgesetz.p 165.Klett. this is at the request of the religious community and a fee is charged for the service.1.5% to 4.5% of the amount collected, depending on the state (Land) Religious instruction is an optional school subject in Germany. The German State understands itself as neutral in matters of religious beliefs,Binder, Gerhard/Wagner, J√ºrgen, Grundwissen Grundgesetz.p 17. Klett. so no teacher can be forced to teach religion. But on the other hand, all who do teach religious instruction need an official permission by their religious community. The treaties with the Holy See are referred to as concordats whereas the treaties with Protestant Churches and umbrellas of Jewish congregations are called \\"state treaties\\". Both are the legal framework for cooperation between the religious bodies and the German State at the federal as well as at the state level.Christian, Hermes, Konkordate im vereinigten Deutschland. Gr√ºnewald. = Greece = In Greece, there is considerable controversy about the separation between the State and the Church, causing many debates in the public sphere regarding if there shall be a more radical change in the Article 3, which is maintaining the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ as the prevailing religion of the country. The actual debate concerning the separation of the Church from the State often becomes a tool for polarization in the political competition. More specifically, Article 3 of the Greek constitution argues the following: # ‚ÄúThe prevailing religion in Greece is that of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ. The Orthodox Church of Greece, acknowledging our Lord Jesus Christ as its head, is inseparably united in doctrine with the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople and with every other Church of Christ of the same doctrine, observing unwaveringly, as they do the holy apostolic and synodal canons and sacred traditions. It is autocephalous and is administered by the Holy Synod of serving Bishops and the Permanent Holy Synod originating thereof and assembled as specified by the Statutory Charter of the Church in compliance with the provisions of the Patriarchal Tome of June 29, 1850 and the Synodal Act of September 4, 1928. # The ecclesiastical regime existing in certain districts of the State shall not be deemed contrary to the provisions of the preceding paragraph. # The text of the Holy Scripture shall be maintained unaltered. Official translation of the text into any other form of language, without prior sanction by the Autocephalous Church of Greece and the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople, is prohibited.‚Äù Moreover, the controversial situation about the no separation between the State and the Church seems to affect the recognition of religious groups in the country as there seems to be no official mechanism for this process. =India= Despite 80% of Indian population are Hindus, under the Constitution of India, India is a secular country and there are no special provisions favouring specific religions in its constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru declared India is a secular state in order to avoid Hindu nationalism and religious conflicts between Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism and other religions. As a result of such government power over religion, politicians are sometimes accused of playing votebank politics, i.e. of giving political support to issues for the sole purpose of gaining the votes of members of a particular community, including religious communities. Both the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The Shah Bano case, a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the Supreme Court's decision. After the 2002 Gujarat violence, there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics. =Italy= In Italy the principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 7 of the Constitution, which states: \\"The State and the Catholic Church are independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere. Their relations are regulated by the Lateran pacts. Amendments to such Pacts which are accepted by both parties shall not require the procedure of constitutional amendments.\\" =IrelandJapan= Shinto became the state religion in Japan with the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and suppression of other religions ensued. Under the American military occupation (1945‚Äì52) \\"State Shinto\\" was considered to have been used as a propaganda tool to propel the Japanese people to war. The Shinto Directive issued by the occupation government required that all state support for and involvement in any religious or Shinto institution or doctrine stop, including funding, coverage in textbooks, and official acts and ceremonies. The new constitution adopted in 1947, Articles 20 and 89 of the Japanese Constitution protect freedom of religion, and prevent the government from compelling religious observances or using public money to benefit religious institutions. =South Korea= Freedom of religion in South Korea is provided for in the South Korean Constitution, which mandates the separation of religion and state, and prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs. Despite this, religious organizations play a major role and make strong influence in politics. =Mexico= The issue of the role of the Catholic Church in Mexico has been highly divisive since the 1820s. Its large land holdings were especially a point of contention. Mexico was guided toward what was proclaimed a separation of church and state by Benito Ju√°rez who, in 1859, attempted to eliminate the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the nation by appropriating its land and prerogatives. President Benito Ju√°rez confiscated church property, disbanded religious orders and he also ordered the separation of church and state His Ju√°rez Law, formulated in 1855, restricting the legal rights of the church was later added to the Constitution of Mexico in 1857. In 1859 the Ley Lerdo was issued ‚Äì purportedly separating church and state, but actually involving state intervention in Church matters by abolishing monastic orders, and nationalizing church property. In 1926, after several years of the Mexican revolutionary war and insecurity, President Plutarco El√≠as Calles, an atheist and leader of the ruling National Revolutionary Party, enacted the Calles Law, which eradicated all the personal property of the churches, closed churches that were not registered with the State, and prohibited clerics from holding a public office. The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in what became known as the Cristero War. After the war's end in 1929, President Emilio Portes Gil upheld a previous truce where the law would remain enacted, but not enforced, in exchange for the hostilities to end. =Norway= An act approved in 2016 created the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity, effective from 1 January 2017. Before 2017 all clergy were civil servants (employees of the central government).Offisielt fr√• statsr√•det 27. mai 2016 regjeringen.no ¬´Sanksjon av Stortingets vedtak 18. mai 2016 til lov om endringer i kirkeloven (omdanning av Den norske kirke til eget rettssubjekt m.m.)

Stortinget.no On 21 May 2012, the Norwegian Parliament passed a constitutional amendment that granted the Church of Norway increased autonomy, and states that \\"the Church of Norway, an Evangelical-Lutheran church, remains Norway's people's church, and is supported by the State as such\\" (\\"people's church\\" or folkekirke is also the name of the Danish state church, Folkekirken), replacing the earlier expression which stated that \\"the Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State.\\" The final amendment passed by a vote of 162‚Äì3. The three dissenting votes were all from the Centre Party. The constitution also says that Norway's values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage, and according to the Constitution, the King is required to be Lutheran. The government will still provide funding for the church as it does with other faith-based institutions, but the responsibility for appointing bishops and provosts will now rest with the church instead of the government. Prior to 1997, the appointments of parish priests and residing chaplains was also the responsibility of the government, but the church was granted the right to hire such clergy directly with the new Church Law of 1997. The Church of Norway is regulated by its own law (kirkeloven) and all municipalities are required by law to support the activities of the Church of Norway and municipal authorities are represented in its local bodies.\\"Church of Norway\\" =Philippines= In Article II \\"Declaration of Principles and State Policies\\", Section 6, the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares, \\"The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.\\" This reasserts, with minor differences in wording and capitalization, a declaration made in Article XV, Section 15 of the 1973 Constitution. Similarly, Article III, Section 5 declares, \\"No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.\\"; echoing Article IV, Section 8 of the 1973 Constitution verbatim. =Romania= Romania is a secular state and has no state religion. However, the role of religion in society is regulated by several articles of the Romanian Constitution. Art 29. Freedom of Conscience. (1) Freedom of thought and opinion, as well as freedom of religion, cannot be limited in any way. No one shall be coerced to adopt an opinion or adhere to a religious faith against their will. (5) Religious cults are autonomous in relation to the state, which provides support including the facilitation of religious assistance in the army, hospitals, penitentiaries, retirement homes and orphanages. Art 32. Right to education (7) The state assures freedom of religious education, according to the requirements of each specific cult. In state schools, religious education is organized and guaranteed by law. =Saudi Arabia= The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and therefore no separation of church and state is present. =Singapore= Singapore is home to people of many religions and does not have any state religion. The government of Singapore has attempted to avoid giving any specific religions priority over the rest. In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore. The Singaporean government claimed that this was justified because members of Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state.\\"Singapore\\", International Religious Freedom Report 2004, U. S. Department of State, As Retrieved 2010-03-11 Singapore has also banned all written materials published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah's Witnesses. A person who possesses a prohibited publication can be fined up to $2,000 Singapore dollars and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction.\\"2010 International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Singapore\\", U.S. State Department, November 17, 2010, As Retrieved 2011-1-15 =Spain= In Spain, commentators have posited that the form of church-state separation enacted in France in 1905 and found in the Spanish Constitution of 1931 are of a \\"hostile\\" variety, noting that the hostility of the state toward the church was a cause of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of the Spanish Civil War.Stepan, Alfred, Arguing Comparative Politics , p. 221, Oxford University Press Following the end of the war, the Catholic Church regained an officially sanctioned, predominant position with General Franco. Religious freedom was guaranteed only in 1966, nine years before the end of the regime. Since 1978, according to the Spanish Constitution (section 16.3) \\"No religion shall have a state character. The public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of Spanish society and shall consequently maintain appropriate cooperation relations with the Catholic Church and other confessions.\\" = Sweden = The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523‚Äì60) and within the half century following his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself under the control of the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771‚Äì92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church ‚Äì and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in practice means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains. = Switzerland = The articles 8 (\\"Equality before the law\\") and 15 (\\"Freedom of religion and conscience\\") of the Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation guarantees individual freedom of beliefs.Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation , status as of 14 June 2015, Federal Chancellery of Switzerland (page visited on 17 December 2015). It notably states that \\" No person may be forced to join or belong to a religious community, to participate in a religious act or to follow religious teachings\\". Churches and state are separated at the federal level since 1848. However, the article 72 (\\"Church and state\\") of the constitution determine that \\"The regulation of the relationship between the church and the state is the responsibility of the cantons\\". Some cantons of Switzerland recognise officially some churches (Catholic Church, Swiss Reformed Church, Old Catholic Church and Jewish congregations). Other cantons, such as Geneva and Neuch√¢tel are la√Øques (that is to say, secular). = Taiwan Turkey= Turkey, whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim, is also considered to have practiced the la√Øcit√© school of secularism since 1928, which the founding father Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's policies and theories became known as Kemalism. Despite Turkey being an officially secular country, the Preamble of the Constitution states that \\"there shall be no interference whatsoever of the sacred religious feelings in State affairs and politics.\\" In order to control the way religion is perceived by adherents, the State pays imams' wages (only for Sunni Muslims), and provides religious education (of the Sunni Muslim variety) in public schools. The State has a Department of Religious Affairs, directly under the Prime Minister bureaucratically, responsible for organizing the Sunni Muslim religion ‚Äì including what will and will not be mentioned in sermons given at mosques, especially on Fridays. Such an interpretation of secularism, where religion is under strict control of the State is very different from that of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and is a good example of how secularism can be applied in a variety of ways in different regions of the world. The exercise of their religion in Turkey by the Greek Orthodox and the Armenian Apostolic communities is partly regulated by the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne. No such official recognition extends to the Syriac communities. Under Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's tenure since 2003, Turkish secularism has come under heavy fire as a new Islamist right-wing populist mood has overtaken Turkish politics. Erdoƒüan has pursued a suite of policies determined to give state backing to particular interpretations of Islam. =United Kingdom= The Church of England, a part of the worldwide Anglican Communion, is an established church, and the British Sovereign is the titular Supreme Governor, and cannot be a Roman Catholic. Until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the monarch could not be married to a Catholic. In state-run schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (but not in privately run schools), there is a requirement for a daily act of worship that is \\"wholly or mainly of a Christian character\\", although non-Christian faith schools are exempt (instead having to have their own form of worship) and sixth-form pupils (in England and Wales) and parents of younger pupils can opt out. Official reports have recommended removing the requirement entirely. The High Court of the United Kingdom has ruled in favour of challenges, brought by pupil families supported by the British Humanist Association, to secondary-level religious studies exam syllabuses that excluded non-religious worldviews. In England, senior Church appointments are Crown appointments; the Church carries out state functions such as coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the House of Lords, where they are known as the Lords Spiritual as opposed to the lay Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and euthanasia. All of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, but non-religious humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out. The Church of Scotland (or Kirk) is the largest religious denomination in Scotland, however, unlike the Church of England it is Presbyterian and (since 1921) not a branch of the state, with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a national church to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The blasphemy law has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, and humanist weddings have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, though sixth formers have no right to opt out. The Church of Ireland was disestablished as early as 1871; the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 (although certain border parishes remain part of the Established Church of England). Unlike the UK Government and to some extent the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government has no religious links, though state-funded religious schools are routinely approved in Wales. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all Welsh schools. Northern Ireland is regarded as the most traditionally Christian country within the UK. Publicly funded Schools in Northern Ireland are either State or Catholic maintained schools. State schools can be classed as: Controlled (by the Education Authority), Voluntary Grammar, Integrated and Special Schools. Irish-Medium Schools are operated by both the State and the Catholic Church. Despite the common notion of 'Protestant' and 'Catholic' Schools among many citizens, all State schools accept all religions without bias, with the exception of Integrated schools which require a set ratio of 40:40:20 Protestant, Catholic and Other(Mixed or non-Christian Religious). An identification with the \\"Protestant\\" or \\"Roman Catholic\\" community is sought on equal opportunities-monitoring forms regardless of actual personal religious beliefs; as the primary purpose is to monitor cultural discrimination by employers. Atheists should select which community they come from, however particpation is not compulsory. Religious Education is compulsary for all children up to the age of 16, with the four major Church denominational bodies (The Catholic Church, The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, The Church of Ireland and the Methodist Church) agreeing on the content of the syllabus, focussing on Christianity and Secular Ethics. World Religions have to be introduced between the ages of 11 and 14. An act of collective christian worship is mandatory in all Northern Irish schools, usually consisting of a short Bible reading, lesson or dramatisation and a prayer during morning assembly. =United States= James Madison, drafter of the Bill of Rights The First Amendment which ratified in 1791 states that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\" However, the phrase \\"separation of church and state\\" itself does not appear in the United States Constitution. The states themselves were free to establish an official religion, and twelve out of the thirteen had official religions. The phrase of Jefferson (see above) was quoted by the United States Supreme Court first in 1878, and then in a series of cases starting in 1947.William M. Wiecek, The birth of the modern Constitution: the United States Supreme Court, 1941‚Äì1953 (Cambridge U.P., 2006) pp. 261‚Äì64 The Supreme Court did not consider the question of how this applied to the states until 1947; when they did, in Everson v. Board of Education, the court incorporated the establishment clause, determining that it applied to the states and that a law enabling reimbursement for busing to all schools (including parochial schools) was constitutional.Kermit Hall, ed. The Oxford companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (2005) pp. 303‚Äì04 . Prior to its incorporation, unsuccessful attempts were made to amend the constitution to explicitly apply the establishment clause to states in the 1870s and 1890s.Philip Hamburger, Separation of Church and State . pp. 10‚Äì11, 287‚Äì334, 342, Harvard University Press, 2004Kermit Hall, ed. The Oxford companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (2005) pp. 262‚Äì63 . The concept was argued to be implicit in the flight of Roger Williams from religious oppression in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to found the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations on the principle of state neutrality in matters of faith. Williams was motivated by historical abuse of governmental power, and believed that government must remove itself from anything that touched upon human beings' relationship with God, advocating a \\"hedge or wall of Separation between the Garden of the Church and the Wilderness of the world\\" in order to keep religion pure. Through his work Rhode Island's charter was confirmed by King Charles II of England, which explicitly stated that no one was to be \\"molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinion, in matters of religion\\". Williams is credited with helping to shape the church and state debate in England, and influencing such men as John Milton and particularly John Locke, whose work was studied closely by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other designers of the U.S. Constitution. Williams theologically derived his views mainly from Scripture and his motive is seen as religious, but Jefferson's advocation of religious liberty is seen as political and social. Though no states currently have an established religion, almost all of the state constitutions invoke God and some originally required officeholders to believe in the Holy Trinity. Early treaties and court decisions=The Treaty of Paris= In 1783, the United States signed a treaty with Great Britain that was promulgated \\"in the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity\\". It was dipped in religious language, crediting \\"'Divine Providence' with having disposed the two parties to 'forget all past misunderstandings,' and is dated 'in the year of our Lord' 1783\\". =The Treaty of Tripoli= In 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that stated in Article 11: According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at Purdue University, the assurances in Article 11 were > intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion > would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. President John > Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign > states, not between two religious powers. Supporters of the separation of church and state argue that this treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, confirms that the government of the United States was specifically intended to be religiously neutral.F. Forrester Church. The separation of church and state (2004) p. 121 The treaty was submitted by President Adams and unanimously ratified by the Senate. =Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States= In the 1892 case Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, Supreme Court Justice David Brewer wrote for a unanimous Court that \\"no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people. ... [T]his is a Christian nation.\\" Legal historian Paul Finkelman writes that: Use of the phrase The phrase \\"separation of church and state\\" is derived from a letter written by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802 to Baptists from Danbury, Connecticut, and published in a Massachusetts newspaper soon thereafter. In that letter, referencing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Jefferson writes: Another early user of the term was James Madison, the principal drafter of the United States Bill of Rights. In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said: Madison contended \\"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\\" Several years later he wrote of \\"total separation of the church from the state\\".(March 2, 1819 letter to Robert Walsh), \\"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States\\", Madison wrote, and he declared, \\"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\\"(1811 letter to Baptist Churches) In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded, > We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without > Kings & Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson > that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of > Govt. Thomas Jefferson's tombstone. The inscription, as he stipulated, reads, \\"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of ... the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom ....\\" This attitude is further reflected in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination. Under the United States Constitution, the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the establishment clause and the free exercise clause. Both are discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion. The phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President John Tyler on July 10, 1843.Tyler wrote, \\"The United States have adventured upon a great and noble experiment, which is believed to have been hazarded in the absence of all previous precedent ‚Äì that of total separation of Church and State. No religious establishment by law exists among us. The conscience is left free from all restraint and each is permitted to worship his Maker after his own judgment. The offices of the Government are open alike to all. No tithes are levied to support an established Hierarchy, nor is the fallible judgment of man set up as the sure and infallible creed of faith. The Mahommedan, if he will to come among us would have the privilege guaranteed to him by the constitution to worship according to the Koran; and the East Indian might erect a shrine to Brahma if it so pleased him. Such is the spirit of toleration inculcated by our political Institutions . ‚Ä¶ The Hebrew persecuted and down trodden in other regions takes up his abode among us with none to make him afraid . ‚Ä¶ and the Aegis of the Government is over him to defend and protect him. Such is the great experiment which we have cried, and such are the happy fruits which have resulted from it; our system of free government would be imperfect without it.\\") quoted in Nicole Gu√©tin, Religious ideology in American politics: a history (2009) p. 85 During the 1960 presidential campaign the potential influence of the Catholic Church on John F. Kennedy's presidency was raised. If elected, it would be the first time that a Catholic would occupy the highest office in the United States. John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying, The United States Supreme Court has referenced the separation of church and state metaphor more than 25 times, though not always fully embracing the principle, saying \\"the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state\\".* See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 673 (1984): \\"The concept of a 'wall' of separation is a useful figure of speech probably deriving from views of Thomas Jefferson. . . . [b]ut the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state.\\" * Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 760 (1973): > Yet, despite Madison's admonition and the 'sweep of the absolute > prohibitions' of the Clauses, this Nation's history has not been one of > entirely sanitized separation between Church and State. It has never been > thought either possible or desirable to enforce a regime of total > separation. * Patrick M. Garry, The Myth of Separation: America's Historical Experience with Church and State, 33 Hofstra L. Rev. 475, 486 (2004) (noting that \\"the strict separationist view was wholly rejected by every justice on the Marshall and Taney courts.\\") * Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 312 (U.S. 1952): \\"The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and State.\\". * Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971): \\"Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense.\\" In Reynolds, the Court denied the free exercise claims of Mormons in the Utah territory who claimed polygamy was an aspect of their religious freedom. The Court used the phrase again by Justice Hugo Black in 1947 in Everson. In a minority opinion in Wallace v. Jaffree, Justice Rehnquist presented the view that the establishment clause was intended to protect local establishments of religion from federal interference. Rehnquist made numerous citations of cases that rebutted the idea of a total wall of separation between Church and State. A result of such reasoning was Supreme Court support for government payments to faith-based community projects. Justice Scalia has criticized the metaphor as a bulldozer removing religion from American public life.Lee v. Weisman, Pledge of Allegiance Critics of the American Pledge of Allegiance have argued that the use of the phrase \\"under God\\" violates the separation of church and state. While the pledge was created by Francis Bellamy in 1891, in 1954, the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization, campaigned with other groups to have the words \\"under God\\" added to the pledge. On June 14, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill to make the addition. Since then, critics have challenged the existence of the phrase in the Pledge. In 2004, Michael Newdow, an ordained atheist minister of the Universal Life Church challenged a Californian law which required students to recite the pledge. He said the law violated his daughter's right to free speech. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school system in Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, mainly due to the fact that the father could not claim sufficient custody of the child over his ex-wife who was the legal guardian and had opposed the lawsuit. Additionally, the Supreme Court stated that teachers leading students in the pledge was constitutional, and therefore the pledge should stay the same.  Religious views =Islam= The separation of religion and state happened very early on in Islamic history. Muslim scholars were endowed and separated from the state, which they became very critical of. The state needed the scholars to legitimize their rule while the scholars did not need the state. Thus, the scholars were generally independent, with some bumps in history like the mihna being the exception rather than the rule. Richard Bulliet writes that during the colonial and postcolonial periods of the Muslim world, a main goal of the political tyrants was to remove the independence of the scholars via removing their economic and social independence. The result is the doors of tyranny opened up which is still visible today in many parts of the Muslim world. Ahmadiyya According to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's understanding of Islam, Islamic principles state that the politics of government should be separate from the doctrine of religion. Special preference should not be given to a Muslim over a non-Muslim. This is best represented by the Constitution of Medina which, in the words of Dr. Craig Considine, was one of the earliest forms of secular governance, providing as it did, equal religious and communal rights to Muslims, Jews and pagans, while recognising them all as bound together by the identity of the city-state. =Christianity= Historically, the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have deemed a close relationship between church and state desirable wherever possible as per the 2105 of the Catechismhttps://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm. The Catholic Church, in addition, teaches that states have a duty to recognize the Catholic faith officially and in its laws and mores, if such states' populations are or become predominantly Catholic. The Orthodox churches have historically at times formed a \\"symphonia\\" with the state, whether de jure or de facto. On the other hand, while some Protestants hold views similar to those above, some Protestants refuse to vote, carry arms, or participate in civil government in any way, often leading to their persecution, as happened to Anabaptists, their descendants including the Amish, Mennonites, and Quakers, in the 20th Century. Anabaptist Protestants and Jehovah's Witnesses, in many countries, believing by not participating they are closer to the Kingdom of God, since \\"Jesus answered (Pilate), 'My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight (to defend him).' \\" ‚Äì John 18:36. For them, the term \\"Christian nation\\" cannot be a valid governmental position, leaving only Christian people, possibly in Christian communities, beyond which are the \\"things which are Caesar's\\" ‚Äì Matthew 22:21.  Methodism In its section on National Reform, the Book of Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection states, with respect to Church and state relations: As such, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Church advocates for Bible reading in public schools, chaplaincies in the Armed Forces and in Congress, blue laws (reflecting historic Methodist belief in Sunday Sabbatarianism), and amendments that advance the recognition of God. Reformed The Reformed tradition of Christianity (Congregationalist, Continental Reformed, Presbyterian denominations) have also addressed the issue of the relationship between the Church and state. In its 1870 General Assembly, the Presbyterian Church in the United States stated: Catholicism The first full articulation of the Catholic doctrine on the principles of the relationship of the Catholic Church to the state (at the time, the Eastern Roman Empire) is contained in the document Famuli vestrae pietatis, written by Pope Gelasius I to the Emperor, which states that the Church and the state should work together in society, that the state should recognize the Church's role in society, with the Church holding superiority in moral matters and the state having superiority in temporal matters. Monsignor John A. Ryan speaks of this Catholic doctrine thusly: \\"If there is only one true religion, and if its possession is the most important good in life, for states as well as individuals, then the public profession, protection, and promotion of this religion, and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it, becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the state. For it is the business of the state to safeguard and promote human welfare in all departments of life.\\" Gaudium et spes (\\"Joy and Hope\\"), the 1965 Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, noted that \\"... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.\\" The mission of the Church recognized that the realities of secularization and pluralism exist despite the traditional teaching on confessional statehood. Because of this reality of secularisation, it also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the secular world, viewing the laity as much-needed agents of change in order to bring about a transformation of society more in line with Catholic teaching. \\"This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.\\". This was further expanded in Apostolicam Actuositatem, Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965. Apostolicam Actuositatem, the Second Vatican Council's \\"Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity\\", was issued 18 November 1965. The purpose of this document was to encourage and guide lay people in their Christian service. \\"Since the laity, in accordance with their state of life, live in the midst of the world and its concerns, they are called by God to exercise their apostolate in the world like leaven, with the ardor of the Spirit of Christ.\\"Pope Paul VI. Apostolicam Actuositatem, ¬ß2, 18 November 1965 Francis Cardinal Arinze explains that lay persons \\"...are called by Baptism to witness to Christ in the secular sphere of life; that is in the family, in work and leisure, in science and cultural, in politics and government, in trade and mass media, and in national and international relations\\".Francis Cardinal Arinze, The Layperson's Distinctive Role, Ignatius Press, 2013 The Catholic teaching in Dignitatis Humanae, the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom (1986), states that all people are entitled to a degree of religious freedom as long as public order is not disturbed and that constitutional law should recognize such freedom.Calo, Zachary A., Catholic Social Thought, Political Liberalism, and the Idea of Human Rights , pp. 18‚Äì19, Samford University, November 2004 \\"If, in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of society, it is at the same time imperative that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be recognized and made effective in practice.Pope Paul VI. Dignitatia humanae, ¬ß6, 7 December 1965 At the same time, the document reiterated that the Church \\"leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ\\". The traditional teaching of the duty of society towards the Church is described in the current edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, number 2105.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1993 edition, https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm The Catholic Church takes the position that the Church itself has a proper role in guiding and informing consciences, explaining the natural law, and judging the moral integrity of the state, thereby serving as check to the power of the state.Grasso, Kenneth L. and Robert P. Hunt, Catholicism and religious freedom: contemporary reflections on Vatican II's declaration on religious liberty , p. 6, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006 The Church teaches that the right of individuals to religious freedom is an essential dignity. Catholic philosopher Thomas Storck argues that, once a society becomes \\"Catholicised\\" and adopts the Church as the state religion, it is further morally bound: \\"'the just requirements of public order' vary considerably between a Catholic state and a religiously neutral state. If a neutral state can prohibit polygamy, even though it is a restriction on religious freedom, then a Catholic state can likewise restrict the public activity of non-Catholic groups. \\"The just requirements of public order\\" can be understood only in the context of a people's traditions and modes of living, and in a Catholic society would necessarily include that social unity based upon a recognition of the Catholic Church as the religion of society, and the consequent exclusion of all other religions from public life. Western secular democracies, committed to freedom of religion for all sects, find no contradiction in proscribing polygamy, although some religions permit it, because its practice is contrary to the traditions and mores of these nations. A Catholic country can certainly similarly maintain its own manner of life.\\" > If, under consideration of historical circumstances among peoples, special > civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional > order of a society, it is necessary at the same time that the right of all > citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be > acknowledged and maintained. Murray, John Courtney and J. Leon Hooper, > Religious liberty: Catholic struggles with pluralism , pp. 213‚Äì14, > Westminster John Knox Press, 1993 The Church takes stances on current political issues, and tries to influence legislation on matters it considers relevant. For example, the Catholic bishops in the United States adopted a plan in the 1970s calling for efforts aimed at a Constitutional amendment providing \\"protection for the unborn child to the maximum degree possible\\". Benedict XVI regards modern idea of freedom (meaning the Church should be free from governmental coercion and overtly political influence from the state) as a legitimate product of the Christian environment,Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. \\"Theology and the Church's Political Stance\\". In: Church, Ecumenism and Politics: New Essays in Ecclesiology (NY: Crossroad, 1988, p. 162). in a similar way to Jacques Le Goff.\\"Les convictions europ√©ennes de l'historien Jacques Le Goff.\\" La vie, 01/04/2014, . However, contrary to the French historian,\\"Jacques Le Goff: \\"Mes h√©ros ne meurent jamais\\".\\" L' Obs, . the Pope rejects the conception of religion as just a private affair.\\"Religion Not Just a Private Affair, Affirms Pontiff.\\" Zenit, . Friendly and hostile separation Scholars have distinguished between what can be called \\"friendly\\" and \\"hostile\\" separations of church and state. The friendly type limits the interference of the church in matters of the state but also limits the interference of the state in church matters. The hostile variety, by contrast, seeks to confine religion purely to the home or church and limits religious education, religious rites of passage and public displays of faith. The hostile model of secularism arose with the French Revolution and is typified in the Mexican Revolution, its resulting Constitution, in the First Portuguese Republic of 1910, and in the Spanish Constitution of 1931.Martinez-Torron, Javier. \\"Freedom of religion in the case law of the Spanish Constitutional court\\", pg. 2, Brigham Young University Law Review, 2001 The hostile model exhibited during these events can be seen as approaching the type of political religion seen in totalitarian states. The French separation of 1905F√©lix F√©n√©on, Nouvelles en trois lignes, 1906 , √©diteur Libella, collection Libretto, 162 pages, Paris, 2019 () and the Spanish separation of 1931 have been characterized as the two most hostile of the twentieth century, although the current church-state relations in both countries are considered generally friendly. Nevertheless, France's former President Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his term considered his country's current state of affairs a \\"negative la√Øcit√©\\" and wanted to develop a \\"positive la√Øcit√©\\" more open to religion. The concerns of the state toward religion have been seen by some as one cause of the civil war in Spain () and Mexico. The French Catholic philosopher and drafter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Jacques Maritain, noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States. He considered the U.S. model of that time to be more amicable because it had both \\"sharp distinction and actual cooperation\\" between church and state, what he called a \\"historical treasure\\" and admonished the United States, \\"Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one.\\" Alexis de Tocqueville, another French observer, tended to make the same distinction: \\"In the U.S., from the beginning, politics and religion were in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since.\\"de Tocqueville, Alexis, Democracy in America, edited and translated by Harvey Mansfield and Delba Winthrop, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000.

Category:Religion and politics Category:Religious policy Category:Religion law ","title":"Separation of church and state"},{"id":"168715","title":"Ron Paul"},{"id":"168717","text":"Triple oppression is a theory developed by black socialists in the United States, such as Claudia Jones. The theory states that a connection exists between various types of oppression, specifically classism, racism, and sexism. It hypothesizes that all three types of oppression need to be overcome at once. It is also referred to as \\"double jeopardy\\", Jane Crow, or triple exploitation.  History  Before triple oppression was termed, black female scholars of the 19th century discussed the unique oppressions of black women. As an abolitionist, Sojourner Truth affirmed the struggles she faced as a result of both her race and gender. Truth voiced opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment with the reasoning that more male power would lead to the greater oppression of black women. In an 1867 speech, she said, \\"...if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.\\" Moreover, suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton stated that black women would suffer from a \\"triple bondage that man never knows\\" if they did not receive voting rights when colored men did. Anna Julia Cooper discussed black women's double enslavement through race and gender. Moreover, in 1904, activist Mary Church Terrell explored the unique discrimination faced by black women when she wrote about women of color‚Äôs discrimination as a result of both their race and gender. According to scholar Eric McDuffie, the term \\"triple exploitation\\" was coined in the 1930s by activist and Communist Party member Louise Thompson Patterson to describe the oppression pertaining to class, race, and gender suffered specifically by black women. Triple oppression was popularized during a time of transition when the Old Left as a movement was rendered powerless post-World War II. Communism, although prominent in earlier years, reached its highest peak in the political atmosphere in the 1960s. The Communist party was made up of immigrant members and foreign and the various coalitions formerly associated with the Socialist Party of America; those workers, many of whom were not fluent English-speakers, made little effort to include Black Americans and their rights even when both mirrored each other. As the Socialist Party was rising, still little effort was made to include many African-American members. Although leaders often were committed against racial segregation, many in the Socialist Party didn't see the connection to racism and how it affected many in the United States. \\"Some African Americans dissatisfied by Socialist attitudes and their unwillingness to speak up about racial issues, joined the Communist party; others went to the African Blood Brotherhood (ABB), which was known for being a radical black liberation organization.\\" The Communist Party's new concept introduced triple oppression focusing on Black women workers. This oppression is shown through, \\"The most privileged group members marginalizes those who are multiply-burdened and obscures claims that cannot be understood as resulting from discrete sources of discrimination.\\" The party focused on the blatant issues of race, class, and gender while including intersectionality. After much frustration from black citizens and a reformulation of the Communist party, many African Americans joined the party to further the goal of equality. Eventually after World War I and II, the communist party underwent many splits that caused the party to get smaller and eventually disappear. Many groups came out of this, including militant power movements like the Black Panther movement. = Claudia Jones = The concept of black women's triple oppression was popularized within the Communist Party by party member Claudia Jones. Jones believed that black women's triple oppression based on race, class, and gender preceded all other forms of oppression. Additionally, she theorized that by freeing black women, who are the most oppressed of all people, freedom would be gained for all people who suffer from race, class, and gender oppression. Jones saw that the Communist Party focused on the oppression of the white working-class male, and she criticized the party's lack of recognition of the specific oppressions of black women in her article, \\"An End to the Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman\\" (1949). Jones was sure to articulate a socialist feminism that took into account not just race, but the disparate struggles of all working women. Jones felt that black American women experienced a unique form of oppression that was not acknowledged by feminism. She argued that with the liberation of black women, black nationalism would be much more achievable. As she puts it, \\"once Negro women undertake action, the militancy of the whole Negro people, and thus of the anti-imperialist coalition is greatly enhanced.\\" Jones's views influenced other Communist women and black female activists, such as Angela Davis and the Combahee River Collective. Davis writes about triple oppression in her book Women, Race and Class (1981).  Double and multiple jeopardy  Frances Beale introduced the term \\"double jeopardy\\" in 1972 to describe the dual oppressions of black women. While she notes that these two oppressions are often linked to economic oppression, this idea was not included in the creation of the term. According to Deborah K. King, racism, sexism, and classism are widely accepted as the major facets of the status of black women. However, some writers have suggested that homophobia should be an additional jeopardy in the black woman's experience. King believes that double jeopardy and triple jeopardy do not fully explain the relationship between the different oppressions faced by black women. Thus, King coined the term \\"multiple jeopardy\\" in 1988 to represent that oppressions are multiplicative, not additive. As such, King believes that different oppressions interact with each other rather than acting independently. Jim Sidanius and colleagues have pointed out that while it is true that subordinate group women (e.g. black women) do experience both racism and sexism, racism tends to be primarily directed at subordinate group males (e.g. black men) and that the empirical evidence supports the idea that the worst outcomes are generally found in subordinate group males, not females as predicted by the double jeopardy hypothesis.  Intersectionality  Intersectionality is the sister of triple oppression while describing the various divisions of human beings. It is a deconstruction of categories such as race, class, and gender. \\"Ain't I a woman,\\" by Sojourner Truth, is associated with intersectionality due to the relationship with the black feminist movement and the multiple identities they manifested in. The idea of triple oppression dives into these different categories, race, class, and gender, by developing an understanding of the way in which each work together often through injustices. Barbara Smith relates this combination by stating, \\"The concept of the simultaneity of oppression is still the crux of a Black feminist understanding of political reality and, I believe, one of the most significant ideological contributions of Black feminist thought.\\" Both intersectionality and triple oppression show the neglect and subordination of many experiences of Black women and these played a vital role in the multitude of movements that prospered out of this.  In various contexts = Political participation in South Africa = In \\"Gender, Social Location, and Feminist Politics in South Africa\\" (1991), Shireen Hassim discusses how triple oppression negatively affects South African women's participation in politics. She argues that the rhetoric surrounding triple oppression at the time of the article's publication focuses too hard on the \\"additive relation between these different dimensions of oppression,\\" and not enough on their interdependent and intersecting facets. Black women workers' struggles are often disregarded as one identity gets the most political attention. Race is politically prioritized, so that gender is seen as less important within the patriarchy, among both women and men. Hassim argues that women's issues exist as political agendas only within broader ones, such as labor movements and resistance to racism. Discouraged by the unreliability created by feminism's bad reputation in South Africa, black women focus less on women's issues and more on anti- apartheid and labor issues, where they may receive more support. Hassim goes on to explain that because of the intersections between capitalism and patriarchy, labor, as a gendered issue, creates a \\"double shift\\" that discourages women from participating politically, because they are too busy juggling their roles as \\"wage-earners and managers of families\\". As women are \\"isolat[ed]...in the household\\", they are robbed of the opportunity to develop \\"a common consciousness of oppression or exploitation.\\" If they cannot gather, women cannot organize. Hassim argues that it is a combination of patriarchal values that empower men and employment obligations in domestic and other service-based jobs that limit women's ability to become active in campaigns that would benefit them only: women's rights campaigns. = Employment opportunities for Mexican-Americans = Denise Segura argues that the social inequality women of color face cannot be properly explained by an analysis any one of the facets that constitute triple oppression, because their subordination in social hierarchies is relative to men, white people, and higher-income strata.Segura, Denise. (1984). Chicanas and Triple Oppression in the Labor Force. National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies Annual Conference. 12th Annual: Chicana Voices - Austin, Texas. Paper 9. 47-65. Chicana, or Mexican-American, women are subject to inequality in the home as well as in social contexts, such as the labor force. The relegation of women and minorities to traditionally low-paying jobs has made it so that Chicanas do not have many options for work outside of agriculture or domesticity, areas characterized by low wages and, therefore, low status. Discrimination based on race and gender and a reluctance to acculturate inhibit occupational mobility. Cultural cues and high fertility also encourage Mexican-American women to remain in the home and bear children instead of participating in the work force. The combination of race and gender bias and the inability to obtain white-collar jobs form the basis for the triple oppression felt by Mexican- American women. In turn, triple oppression limits Chicanas‚Äô employment opportunities to low wages, lower than her male (Chicano) and white (women) counterparts, and \\"secondary\\" jobs e.g. clerical and factory jobs, effectively solidifying their status at the bottom of the social hierarchy. = Asian- American activism = Adrienne Ann Winans and Judy Tzu-Chun Wu argue that \\"othered\\" groups, such as racial minorities, suffer from poor job prospects because of their \\"designat[ion] as outsiders.\\" Groups marginalized by legal status and patriarchal values often find only low-paying work with little to no benefits or job security. Poor employment opportunities contribute to an intersectional subordination that includes legal status, gender, and race. Asian-American women's organizational efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to counter such phenomena proved to facilitate them. According to Winans and Wu, female activists recognized a bias within their own activism circles which \\"relied on female labor but privileged male leadership.\\" Other manifestations of triple oppression in the Asian-American community are the exploitation of immigrant female workers, and gender roles that prescribe a duty to the \\"double shift.\\" Within the double shift, women are expected to not only procreate but also rear the products of their unions and contribute to the work force at the same time, a feat not demanded of their male counterparts. = Queer communities = While the term triple oppression has typically been reserved to describe the plights of working women of color, the phenomenon of three intersecting social burdens has plagued gay men of color. Diaz et al.'s 1999 study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that the combined impact of homophobia, racism, and poverty cause adverse psychological effects in Latino men, including low self-esteem, depression, sleeping problems, anxiety, and social alienation. A factor that does not arise in typical analyses of triple oppression is HIV incidence, but this study concludes that HIV status as a source of social discrimination to the likes of race and class correlates with higher psychological symptoms. Gay men may benefit from male privilege, but in any case, they too can experience a measure of oppression in the form of systemic homophobia, with incidents of violence, belittlement, familial disapproval, job discrimination and police harassment. = Catalan countries = Catalan nationalist left-wing feminists have theorised a triple oppression characterisation of the status of working- class Catalan women. Their perspective points out to capitalism, Spanish nationalism and patriarchy as three interlocking domination systems.

Ultimate released a series of successful games for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, MSX and Commodore 64 computers from 1983 until its closure in 1988. Ultimate are perhaps best remembered for the big-selling titles Jetpac and Sabre Wulf, each of which sold over 300,000 copies in 1983 and 1984 respectively, and their groundbreaking series of isometric arcade adventures using a technique termed Filmation. Knight Lore, the first of the Filmation games, has been retrospectively described in the press as \\"seminal ... revolutionary\\" (GamesTM), \\"one of the most successful and influential games of all time\\" (X360), and \\"probably ... the greatest single advance in the history of computer games\\" (Edge). By the time of the label's last use in 1988 on a retrospective compilation, Ultimate had evolved into Rare and moved on to developing titles for Nintendo consoles. Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002 for US$377 million, a record price for a video game developer, and now develops exclusively for Microsoft platforms such as Xbox and Microsoft Windows. In 2006, Rare revived the \\"Ultimate Play the Game\\" name for an Xbox Live Arcade remake of Jetpac named Jetpac Refuelled. In 2015, several Ultimate titles were collected and released as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. History=Early history and rise= Ultimate Play the Game was founded in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1982 by Tim and Chris Stamper, their friend John Lathbury, and Tim's girlfriend (later wife) Carole Ward. Other members of the Stamper family were also involved in the early running and support of the company, which was initially located in a house next to the family-run newsagent.Jones, Darran and King, Ryan. X360 Magazine supplemental: Rare ‚Äì The Ultimate Story, page 9. Imagine Publishing, 2005. Both Tim and Chris had worked in arcade game development including, according to one report, Konami's Gyruss, and claimed to be \\"the most experienced arcade video game design team in Britain\\" until tiring of working for others and leaving to start Ashby Computers and Graphics. This led to ACG's initial trade being in creating arcade conversion kits, before moving into the home computer software market developing games under the Ultimate Play the Game name. Ashby released four arcade games: Blue Print for Bally- Midway, and Grasspin, Dingo and Saturn for Jaleco. Ultimate's first release was Jetpac in May 1983 for the 16K Spectrum, followed by BBC Micro and Commodore VIC-20 versions. It was a huge commercial success; the Spectrum version alone sold more than 300,000 copies to a market of only one million Spectrum owners at the time,Rollings, Andrew. The ZX Spectrum Book ‚Äì 1982-199x. Hiive publishing, 2007. Jones and King quote the Jetman sales figure as being 330,000. and providing the fledgling company with a turnover in excess of ¬£1 million. This was followed by three further 16K releases, Pssst in June, Tranz Am, and Cookie, before Ultimate stepped up to the 48K Spectrum. Jetpac, Pssst, Tranz Am and Cookie were four of only ten games ever to be released on the 16K ROM format for use with the ZX Interface 2. They were also republished on cassette, with distinctive silver inlay cards, by Sinclair Research for inclusion in ZX Spectrum bundles. Ultimate's first 48K releases were Lunar Jetman ‚Äì a sequel to Jetpac ‚Äì and Atic Atac both of which were released in late 1983. Both games were very well received by the gaming press, CRASH magazine in particular praising what Ultimate had managed to do with the extra memory Lunar Jetman used. In 1984 came Sabre Wulf, the first in the Sabreman series, and the first release at a recommended retail price of ¬£9.95. The price of Ultimate titles had previously been just ¬£5.50, which was typical for Spectrum arcade-style games at the time. This increase was to discourage piracy, with the idea being that if customers paid more for a game they would be less inclined to give away copies.Jones, Darran and King, Ryan. X360 supplemental: Rare ‚Äì The Ultimate Story, page 13. Imagine Publishing, 2005. This coincided with the introduction of the distinctive Ultimate \\"big box\\" packaging (used with all further Spectrum releases until Gunfright, and with various releases on other platforms), which the company felt might also help justify the price increase and encourage gamers to buy the game rather than copy it. The strategy paid off as Sabre Wulf went on to sell over 350,000 copies on the Spectrum alone.Sabre Wulf at Eurogamer.net. Retrieved 30 October 2007. This was followed by the simultaneous release at the end of 1984 of the next two instalments in the Sabreman series, Underwurlde and Knight Lore. Knight Lore was something of a revolution in the home computer game market, using a forced-perspective isometric viewpoint branded Filmation, the style of which would be extensively copied in other games, notable examples being Batman and Head Over Heels from Ocean Software. Knight Lore, and some of its Filmation follow-up Alien 8, was actually completed before Sabre Wulf but Ultimate decided that it could have a potentially negative effect on sales of the comparatively primitive Sabre Wulf, so it was postponed until late 1984 for a simultaneous release with Underwurlde. Ultimate won the Golden Joystick Award for Best Software House in both 1983 and 1984. Ultimate ran into some criticism in the gaming media for their repeated use of the Filmation technique in subsequent games Alien 8, Nightshade, Gunfright and Pentagram, though Nightshade and Gunfright used Filmation II, a variation on the engine, resulting in a similar visual style, but significantly different gameplay, with scrolling around a large world and arcade-like play, rather than the room-based puzzles of the earlier Filmation titles. =Decline and fall= With the consistent success of Ultimate's releases there were rumours of a buyout by Ocean, until it was announced in 1985 that the Stamper brothers had sold the Ultimate catalogue and name to US Gold, who would continue to release games under the Ultimate label. Later titles such as Martianoids and Bubbler were not seen by the gaming press as being up to Ultimate's previously high standards and sales fell. US Gold released no new Ultimate games after Bubbler in 1987. A final Sabreman game, Mire Mare, was trailed in earlier Sabreman games and was mentioned by Sinclair User as being next up for release, but was quietly dropped during development. In late 1988 Rare bought back all the rights sold to US Gold and were reported to be developing games again. Future releases were to have included Solar Jetman, which would eventually appear only on the Nintendo Entertainment System, although home computer conversions for the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST were completed by Storm Software, but not released. =Rare Limited= Shortly before the US Gold buyout, the name of another company \\"Rare Limited\\" began appearing on the credits of Ultimate releases. This was in fact another company set up by the Stampers to develop for Ultimate, but not be subject to any Ultimate takeover. Rare (initially under the banner Rare: Designs on the Future) would evolve after Ultimate's demise into a prolific developer for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This led Nintendo to purchase a stake in the company, whose success was furthered with such classic SNES and Nintendo 64 releases as Donkey Kong Country and Goldeneye 007. In 2002 Rare was purchased outright by Microsoft for US$377 million, a record fee for a video game developer, and currently develops games for the Xbox One console. At the end of 2006 Tim and Chris Stamper left Rare to \\"pursue other opportunities\\", ending a 24-year involvement in developing home video games. =The Ultimate name in subsequent years= In 2004, Rare revived Ultimate's Sabreman franchise with the release of Sabre Wulf for the Game Boy Advance. A new version of Sabre Wulf for the Xbox was also rumoured,Sabre Wulf on Xbox? at computerandvideogames.com. though it was never released or even officially announced. A racing game based on the Ultimate/Rare universe titled Sabreman Stampede was also in development, but was canceled.Secret Rare racer revealed! at computerandvideogames.com. In 2007 Rare released the fourth game of the Jetman series Jetpac Refuelled for Xbox Live Arcade. On 8 December 2006 and 16 January 2007 respectively, Rare's owners Microsoft Corporation filed US and EU trademark claims on the Ultimate Play the Game name and logo. The registered purpose is \\"entertainment services, namely, providing an on-line computer game\\". Due to the nature of this US government site, the relevant page cannot be directly linked to, so a search must be manually performed. The EU trademark may be found here: Emulated versions of seven Ultimate titles were later included as part of the 2015 game compilation Rare Replay for Xbox One. Relationship with the press and fans=Press= An advertisement in the style commonly used by Ultimate. Ultimate had a reputation for secrecy that has continued to a lesser extent with successor Rare. Due to the small number of staff employed at Ultimate in the early days they didn't have the time to talk to the press or attend trade events. The British computer gaming press even complained over how difficult it was to get hold of them. As Tim Stamper later said: This press blackout soon worked to the company's advantage. Due to their reputation for producing high quality products, along with speculation in the press and amongst gamers, anticipation for each release would be high. This was helped along by the full-page advertisements placed in magazines showing the cover art of the game in question, but no shots or description of the game itself. These ads would be run prior to and for several months after the release date. The magazines wouldn't even be able to preview the games; the review copies, usually sent out just before general release, would be the first opportunity for anyone to see them. Not talking to the press worked for Ultimate and it soon became policy. In fact, when a journalist reviewing Nightshade for CRASH magazine asked Ultimate what the object of the game was, and how large the play area was, they responded with, respectively, \\"oh, we can't tell you that\\" and \\"it's pretty large\\". Lunar Jetman's trailer The Lunar Jetman \\"trailer\\" screenshot as published in CRASH magazine, February 1986. This air of mystery was increased when CRASH magazine published a reader's photograph of Lunar Jetman featuring Jetman's moon rover pulling a trailer. The possible existence of a trailer (as depicted on the game's cover art and loading screen) had been speculated on since the game's release, and many fans had searched fruitlessly for it. The Stampers shrugged off questions about whether this screen shot was genuine, but stopped short of actually denying it. There have even been suggestions that Ultimate themselves may have created the screen shot to generate more interest in the game. It has since been proven that Lunar Jetman's code does not contain graphics for a trailer.Ultimate Play the Game ‚Äì Company Lookback, Retro Micro Games Action ‚Äì The Best of GamesTM Retro Volume 1, pages 24‚Äì26. Imagine Publishing, 2006 =Fans= Ultimate were one of the first developers to have their own fanbase focused on the company and brand as much as the games themselves. They received so much fan mail at their peak that a full-time employee had to be taken on to deal with up to 60 letters per day. They were known for their positive attitude to fans, always replying to letters and responding to requests for merchandise by sending posters, sweatshirts and caps free of charge. The Stampers later stated that they were more interested in creating the games than making money from merchandising. Retro Gamer has suggested that besides the quality of the games, Ultimate's popularity arose from a combination of \\"superb presentation\\" as well as the company's \\"air of mystique\\" giving it a \\"secretive yet cool vibe\\".Ultimate Collectables, Retro Gamer Anthology, pages 61‚Äì63, Live Publishing, 2004 Releases on other platforms The main series of games produced by Ultimate were all released on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, with most from Sabre Wulf onward also on the Amstrad CPC and MSX, and most early games up to and including Nightshade also on the BBC Micro. Only three of these (Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde and Nightshade) were released on the other major platform of the time, the Commodore 64, however a series of C64-exclusive titles were published by Ultimate: :* The Staff of Karnath (1984) :* Entombed (1984) :* Imhotep (1985) :* Blackwyche (1985) :* Outlaws (1985) :* Dragon Skulle (1985) The Staff of Karnath, Entombed, Blackwyche and Dragon Skulle all concern the adventures of Sir Arthur Pendragon. Authorship The company's secretive tendencies also extended to the question of who wrote the games. Whereas most games of the time would list those responsible on the cassette inlay cards or even on the front of the box (one notable example, Football Manager, even going as far as to feature a picture of author Kevin Toms on the front of the box), no Ultimate title ever mentioned any names at all, and the authorship of some of them remains unclear. The Ultimate titles up to Gunfright were produced primarily by Tim and Chris Stamper, Tim provided the graphics and Chris the programming, along with fellow founders John Lathbury (coding) and Carol Ward (graphic design). Tim also created the cover art for the games, including the famous Ultimate Play the Game logo. The Stampers retained the major creative roles until the purchase by US Gold, who brought in their own programming teams to create Martianoids and Bubbler. The exact authorship of Pentagram and Cyberun is known only to those involved; often considered US Gold games, they are both possibly Stamper games. This remains a possibility as although Chris Stamper has said in an interview, \\"What was the last one we developed as a team? It was Gunfright, I think\\", Ultimate had already admitted to developing games in an order different from that of their release, as with Knight Lore and Sabre Wulf. The authorship of the Commodore 64 titles was at the time even more uncertain. The conversions of existing Spectrum games Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde and Nightshade were handled by Firebird, who hired Mr Micro, Softstone, and PSI, respectively, to develop the titles. Imhotep was submitted to Ultimate in a virtually complete form by author Manuel Caballero, who had previously written Batty Builders and Firefleet. Ultimate did not make any announcements regarding the authorship of the other Commodore games, but an article by Martyn Carroll revealed how Frank Gasking of \\"Games that weren't 64\\" managed to identify the creators as Dave and Robert (Bob) Thomas based on a message that appears on the final screen of Dragonskulle. These two brothers were also the creators of the previous three games of the series The Staff of Karnath, Entombed and Blackwyche, In an interview with the brothers in Retro Gamer magazine, they revealed they also authored Outlaws, in just six weeks, so Ultimate would have something for the Commodore 64 for Christmas.

It is the first in a trilogy about an upper-class English family in the interwar period. Although a comedy, the story has tragic overtones. Plot summary The narrator is Fanny, whose mother (called \\"The Bolter\\" for her habit of serial monogamy) and father have left her to be brought up by her Aunt Emily and the valetudinarian Davey, whom Emily marries early in the novel. Fanny also spends holidays with her Uncle Matthew Radlett, Aunt Sadie, and numerous cousins at Alconleigh. Linda, the second Radlett daughter, is Fanny's best friend and the main character of the novel. The early chapters recount the Radlett children's bizarre upbringing, including their contrasting obsessions with hunting and preventing cruelty to animals, and the activities of their secret society, \\"the Hons.\\" The Radlett daughters receive little in the way of formal education, and as Linda grows older she is increasingly consumed by a desire for romantic love and marriage. Louisa, the eldest Radlett child, makes her d√©but and quickly becomes engaged to John Fort William, a Scottish peer more than twenty years her senior. Linda finds Lord Fort William an unromantic choice of husband, but is deeply jealous that Louisa is getting married. Linda becomes bored and depressed, awaiting her own coming-out party. During this time she makes friends with Lord Merlin, a neighbouring landlord who is a wealthy, charming aesthete with many fashionable friends. Merlin brings Tony Kroesig, heir to a wealthy banking family, as a last-minute guest to Linda's coming-out ball. Linda falls in love with Tony, but their relationship is rocky from the start. Uncle Matthew disapproves of Tony's German ancestry (he believes that all foreigners are fiends), and is furious when Linda and Fanny sneak away to Oxford to have luncheon with Tony. Linda and Tony eventually marry despite the strong disapproval of their families. Linda very quickly realises that she has made a serious mistake, but she keeps up a pretence of having a happy marriage. Linda and Tony have one child, Moira, to whom Linda takes an instant dislike. Linda almost dies during Moira's birth, and her doctors strongly advise her to have no more children. Moira is soon abandoned to the care of her paternal grandparents. During this time, Fanny marries a young man called Alfred and begins a family of her own; she therefore sees Linda less frequently. After nine years of marriage, Linda leaves Tony for Christian Talbot, an ardent Communist. Christian is kind but vague, and ultimately uninterested in individuals, preferring to focus on the plight of the working class. Linda's divorce and remarriage cause a rift between her and her parents, but after some months they reconcile. Linda and Christian go to France to work with Spanish refugees in Perpignan during the Spanish Civil War, where they meet Linda's old friend Lavender Davis, an efficient young woman also volunteering to help the refugees. Linda realises that Christian and Lavender are falling in love with one another and that they would be a better pairing. Linda decides to leave Christian and leave France. On the way back to England, Linda runs out of money in Paris and meets Fabrice de Sauveterre, a wealthy French duke. Linda becomes his mistress and lives with him in Paris for eleven months. During this time she cultivates a great interest in clothes, which Fabrice encourages and finances, but most of her happiness is the result of the fact that she has finally found the love of her life. When World War II breaks out, Fabrice persuades Linda to return to England alone, for he has work to do in the French Resistance. During the war, he is able to visit Linda in England once. She becomes pregnant. Meanwhile, for safety during the London Blitz, Fanny, Louisa, and their children are living at Alconleigh, along with Matthew, Sadie, Emily, Davey, \\"the Bolter,\\" and her new lover Juan (whom Uncle Matthew calls \\"Gewan\\"). When Linda's house is bombed, she also goes to stay at Alconleigh. The Bolter sees Linda as a younger version of herself, which Linda resents, because she is certain that she has found the love of her life in Fabrice and will not run off from any more husbands. Fanny is also expecting a baby, and she and Linda give birth to their sons on the same day. Linda dies in childbirth, as the doctors had warned; around this same time, Fabrice is killed in the war. Fanny and her husband adopt Linda's child and name him Fabrice. Mitford wrote two sequels to the novel, Love in a Cold Climate (1949) and Don't Tell Alfred (1960). Her penultimate novel, The Blessing (1951), also references The Pursuit of Love and characters from The Blessing later appear in Don't Tell Alfred.

The band was founded by teen brothers Max and Igor Cavalera, the impoverished sons of V√¢nia, a model, and Graciliano, a well-to-do Italian diplomat whose fatal heart attack left his family in financial ruin.Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 14. Graciliano's death deeply affected his sons, inspiring them to form a band after Max heard the album Black Sabbath Vol. 4 the very same day. They chose the band name Sepultura, the Portuguese word for \\"grave\\", when Max translated the lyrics of the Mot√∂rhead song \\"Dancing on Your Grave\\". The brothers' early influences included Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, and metal and hard rock artists of the early 1980s, such as Van Halen, Iron Maiden, Mot√∂rhead, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and V8. They would travel to a record shop in S√£o Paulo that mixed tapes of the latest records by American bands. Their listening habits changed dramatically after being introduced to Venom. As Igor Cavalera put it: The Cavalera brothers started listening to bands such as Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Kreator, Sodom, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, and Exciter.Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 26. They also had influences on Brazilian metal from bands like Stress, Sagrado Inferno, and Dorsal Atl√¢ntica. By 1984, they had dropped out of school. After several early membership changes, Sepultura established a stable lineup of Max on guitar, Igor on drums, vocalist Wagner Lamounier, and bassist Paulo Jr.Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 21. Lamounier departed in March 1985 after disagreements with the band, and moved on to become the leader of the pioneering Brazilian black metal band Sarc√≥fago. After his departure, Max took over the vocal duties. Jairo Guedes was invited to join the band as lead guitarist.Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 28. Bestial Devastation and Morbid Visions (1984‚Äì1986) After about a year of performing, Sepultura signed to Cogumelo Records in 1985. Later that year, they released Bestial Devastation, a shared EP with fellow Brazilian band Overdose. It was recorded and self-produced in just two days. The band recorded their first full-length album, Morbid Visions, in August 1986. It contained their first hit, \\"Troops of Doom\\", which gained some media attention. The band then decided to relocate to the larger city of S√£o Paulo. Schizophrenia, Beneath the Remains, and Arise (1987‚Äì1992) Andreas Kisser has been the lead guitarist of Sepultura since 1987. His arrival provided the group with a more technical experience. In early 1987, Jairo Guedz quit the band. Guedz was replaced by S√£o Paulo-based guitarist Andreas Kisser,Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 49. and they released their second studio album, Schizophrenia, later that year. The album reflected a stylistic change towards a more thrash metal-oriented sound, while still keeping the death metal elements of Morbid Visions. Schizophrenia was an improvement in production and performance, and became a minor critical sensation across Europe and America as a much sought-after import. The band sent tapes to the United States that made radio playlists at a time when they were struggling to book gigs, because club owners were afraid to book them due to their style. The band gained attention from Roadrunner Records who signed them and released Schizophrenia internationally before seeing the band perform in person. During a May 2018 interview with teenyrockers.com, Kisser noted that Sepultura would not have been possible without family support, not only from his own family, but also from the families of Max and Igor, and Paulo Jr. The band's third studio album, Beneath the Remains, was released in 1989. The album was recorded in a rustic studio in Rio de Janeiro while the band communicated through translators with the American producer Scott Burns. It was an immediate success and became known in thrash metal circles as a classic on the order of Slayer's Reign in Blood. It was hailed by Terrorizer magazine as one of the all-time top 20 thrash metal albums,Terrorizer No. 109 (2003), page 35 (author unknown) as well as gaining a place in their all-time top 40 death metal records.Hinchliffe 2006, page 54 AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, \\"The complete absence of filler here makes this one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time.\\" A long European and American tour furthered the band's reputation, despite the fact that they were still very limited English speakers. Their first US show was held on October 31, 1989 at the Ritz in New York City, opening for Danish heavy metal band King Diamond. The band filmed its first video for the single \\"Inner Self\\". In January 1991, Sepultura played for more than 100,000 people at the Rock in Rio II festival. The band relocated from their native Brazil to Phoenix, Arizona in 1990, obtained new management, and recorded the album Arise at Morrisound Studios in Tampa, Florida. By the time the album was released in March 1991, the band had become one of the most critically praised thrash/death metal bands of the time. The first single \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\" was a success, and the title track gained additional attention when its video was banned by MTV America due to its apocalyptic religious imagery. The album was critically acclaimed and their first to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 119. Max Cavalera married the band's manager Gloria Bujnowski during this period. In 1992, Sepultura was part of two major tours: Helmet/Ministry and Alice in Chains/Ozzy Osbourne. Chaos A.D., Nailbomb and Roots (1993‚Äì1996) Sepultura's fifth album, Chaos A.D., was released in 1993. It saw a departure from their death metal style,Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 131. adding influences of groove metal, industrial and hardcore punk. While Chaos A.D. is not a death metal album, the album does include elements of thrash metal music. AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and wrote that, \\"Chaos A.D. ranks as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.\\" In 1994, Max and Igor collaborated with Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel to form Nailbomb. They released an even more industrial-oriented album, Point Blank the same year. The group performed only one full live gig at Dynamo Open Air in 1995, and the performance was released as Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide. Nailbomb was disbanded shortly afterwards. Sepultura's sound change continued with their sixth album, Roots, which was released in 1996. On this album the band experimented with elements of the music of Brazil's indigenous peoples, and adopted a slower, down-tuned sound. The album was hailed as a modern-day heavy metal classic and a major influence on the then-nascent nu metal scene. AllMusic gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, \\"Roots consolidates Sepultura's position as perhaps the most distinctive, original heavy metal band of the 1990s.\\" In 1996, Sepultura performed \\"War (Guerra)\\" for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin produced by the Red Hot Organization. Departure of Max Cavalera (1996‚Äì1997) In August 1996, Sepultura played on the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock main stage alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Paradise Lost, Type O Negative, Biohazard, and Fear Factory. The band was suddenly a three-piece with Andreas Kisser taking over on lead vocals, after Max Cavalera left the concert site earlier in the day upon learning of the death of his stepson Dana Wells in a car accident. After Dana Wells' funeral was finished, Max returned and continued to tour with Sepultura. A few months after Wells' death, the band had a meeting with Max and said that they wanted to fire their manager Gloria Bujnowski, who was Max's wife and Dana's mother, and find new management. Their reasoning was that Bujnowski was giving preferential treatment to Max while neglecting the rest of the band. Max, who was still coming to terms with the death of Wells, felt betrayed by his bandmates for wanting to get rid of Bujnowski and abruptly quit the band. Max Cavalera's final performance with Sepultura was at Brixton Academy in England on December 16, 1996.Rock Sound Issue 15576:pg 56. Sepultura: what really happened in London? =Derrick Green era=Against, Nation and Roorback (1998‚Äì2005) Derrick Green has been the singer of Sepultura since 1998, when he replaced Max Cavalera, who had left the band in 1996. Following Max Cavalera's departure, the remaining members of Sepultura announced plans to find a new vocalist. Among those who auditioned were Chuck Billy of Testament, Phil Demmel of Machine Head and Vio-lence, Marc Grewe of Morgoth, Jorge Rosado of Merauder and a then-unknown Jason \\"Gong\\" Jones. American musician Derrick Green from Cleveland, Ohio, was selected as the band's new front-man. The first album with the new line-up was Against, which was released in 1998. The album was critically and commercially less successful than previous albums and sold considerably fewer copies than the debut album by Max Cavalera's new band Soulfly. In a retrospective review AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating that \\"there are enough flashes of the old Sepultura brilliance to suggest that great things are still to come\\". The band's eighth album, Nation, released in 2001, sold poorly. It would be their last studio album with Roadrunner Records. AllMusic gives the album 3 stars out of 5 and said, \\"As Green scrapes the lining of his vocal chords through the brash, impassioned tracks, he's singing about more than just 'one nation, Sepulnation'; he's suggesting something bigger, something worth shouting about and fighting for.\\" In an interview, Derrick Green said that, \\"Every song will be related to the idea of building this nation. We will have our own flags, our own anthem.\\" A recording of Max Cavalera's last live show with Sepultura, titled Under a Pale Grey Sky, was released in 2002 by Roadrunner Records. After recording Revolusongs, an EP of covers in 2002, the band released their ninth studio album, Roorback, in 2003. Despite receiving greater critical acclaim than its predecessors, sales remained low. It was their first album with SPV Records. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, \\"if there are still any lingering doubts about the Green/Sepultura match, 2003's excellent Roorback should put them to rest for good. Green is passionate and focused throughout the album ‚Äî he has no problem going that extra mile ‚Äî and the writing is consistently strong.\\" In 2005, the band played in Dubai for the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival. In November of that year, a live double DVD/double CD package, Live in S√£o Paulo, was released. This was the first official live album from the band. Dante XXI, A-Lex, and departure of Igor Cavalera (2006‚Äì2010) Sepultura in Poland. Sepultura's tenth album, Dante XXI, was released on March 14, 2006. It is a concept album based on Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy. Music videos were recorded for the songs \\"Convicted in Life\\" and \\"Ostia\\". AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, \\"Overall, Dante XXI is easily one of Sepultura's strongest releases to feature Green on vocals.\\" In a 2007 interview with Revolver magazine, Max Cavalera stated that he and Igor, both of whom having recently reconciled after a decade-long feud, would reunite with the original Sepultura lineup. There were also rumors that the reunited line up would play on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. However, this was denied by Kisser and the reunion did not occur. Instead, Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of Dante XXI and was replaced by Brazilian drummer Jean Dolabella, leaving the band without any of its original members. After leaving Sepultura, Igor and Max formed Cavalera Conspiracy. The band was one of the featured musical guests at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 on November 13. They performed a cover of \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\", and \\"We've Lost You\\" from the album A-Lex. The 9th annual Latin Grammy Awards ceremony was held at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas and aired on Univision. Sepultura also appeared in a successful ad campaign for Volkswagen motors commercial that aired nationally throughout Brazil in 2008. The spot said that \\"it's the first time you've seen Sepultura like this. And a Sedan like this one too\\". The Volkswagen TV spot shows Sepultura playing bossa nova, the opposite of its heavy metal style, to say that \\"you never saw something like this, as you never saw a car like the new Voyage.\\" Sepultura released the album A-Lex on January 26, 2009. This was the first Sepultura album to include neither of the Cavalera brothers, with bassist Paulo Jr. as the sole remaining member from the band's debut album. A-Lex is a concept album based on the book A Clockwork Orange. The album was recorded at Trama Studios in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, with producer Stanley Soares. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, \\"Personnel changes can have a very negative effect on a band, but Sepultura have maintained their vitality all these years ‚Äì and that vitality is alive and well on the superb A-Lex.\\" In the same year Andreas Kisser contributed his recipe for \\"Churrasco in Soy Sauce\\" to Hellbent for Cooking: The Heavy Metal Cookbook, stating in the recipe that he prefers his meat \\"medium-rare\\". Sepultura supported Metallica on January 30 and 31, 2010, at Morumbi Stadium in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The two concerts were attended by 100,000 people. The band filmed a concert DVD in 2010. Sepultura played at Kucukciftlik Park, Istanbul, on April 27, 2010. On August 8, 2010 visited the UK to play at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone. Kairos and The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart (2010‚Äì2014) Drummer Eloy Casagrande in 2014. Casagrande has been the drummer of Sepultura since 2011. On July 6, 2010, it was announced that Sepultura were signed with Nuclear Blast Records, and would release their first album for the label in 2011. The band confirmed that there would be no reunion of the classic lineup. By the end of 2010, the band began writing new material and entered the studio to begin recording their 12th album with producer Roy Z (Judas Priest, Halford, Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, Helloween and Andre Matos). On March 1, 2011, Sepultura had completed recording their new album, entitled Kairos, which was released in June 2011. The album includes cover versions of Ministry's \\"Just One Fix\\" and The Prodigy's \\"Firestarter\\", both of which are available as bonus tracks on various special-edition releases. Sepultura played on the Kairos World Tour and at Wacken Open Air 2011. Drummer Jean Dolabella left the band and was replaced by 20-year-old Eloy Casagrande in November 2011, who had already played in Brazilian heavy metal singer Andre Matos' solo band and in the Brazilian post-hardcore band Gloria. In November and December 2011 Sepultura participated the Thrashfest Classics 2011 tour alongside thrash metal bands like Exodus, Destruction, Heathen, and Mortal Sin. In May 2012, guitarist Andreas Kisser told Metal Underground that Sepultura would soon \\"start working on something new with Eloy\\" and see if they could \\"get ready for new music early next year\\". In an interview at England's Bloodstock Open Air on August 10, 2012, Kisser revealed that Sepultura would be filming a live DVD with the French percussive group Les Tambours du Bronx. He also revealed that the band was \\"already thinking about new ideas\\" for their next album and would \\"have something new going on\\" in 2013. On December 10, 2012, producer Ross Robinson, who produced Sepultura's Roots album, tweeted: \\"Oh, didn't mention.. Spoke to Andreas, it's on. My vision, smoke Roots\\" suggesting he would be producing the band's next album. This was later confirmed, as well as an announcement that the album would be co-produced by Steve Evetts. Former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo made a guest appearance on the album. On January 25, 2013, it was announced that author Jason Korolenko was working on Relentless ‚Äì 30 Years of Sepultura, which is described in a press release as \\"the only book-length biography to cover the band's entire 30-year career.\\" Relentless was published on October 8, 2014 in Poland under the title Brazylijska Furia, and the English language edition was published via Rocket 88 on December 4, 2014. The Brazilian edition, titled Relentless ‚Äì 30 Anos de Sepultura, is scheduled for publication via Benvira in early 2015. The French language edition of \\"Relentless\\" was published in France on October 19, 2015. On July 19, 2013, it was revealed that the title of the band's thirteenth album was The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart. In September 2013, they performed at Rock in Rio with Brazilian rock/MPB artist Z√© Ramalho ‚Äì this line-up was named \\"Z√©pultura\\", a portmanteau of both artists' names. Machine Messiah and Quadra (2015‚Äìpresent) In a June 2015 interview with Yell! Magazine, guitarist Andreas Kisser stated that Sepultura would begin work on their fourteenth studio album after the completion of The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart tour. Sepultura's fourteenth studio album, Machine Messiah, was released on January 13, 2017. In support of the album, Sepultura (along with Soilwork and Aborted) supported Kreator on the Gods of Violence tour in Europe in February‚ÄìMarch 2017, and along with Prong, they supported Testament on the Brotherhood of the Snake tour in the United States in April‚ÄìMay 2017. The band also toured Europe in February and March 2018 with Obscura, Goatwhore and Fit for an Autopsy, and Australia in May with Death Angel. The first official Sepultura documentary, Sepultura Endurance, was premiered in May 2017 and released on June 17. Max and Igor declined to be interviewed for the film and also refused to allow early material of the band to be used. In an August 2018 interview at Wacken Open Air, Kisser confirmed that Sepultura had begun the songwriting process of their fifteenth studio album, and stated later that month that it was not expected to be released before 2020. The band began recording the album in August 2019 with producer Jens Bogren for a tentative February 2020 release. During their show at Rock in Rio 8, the band announced the name and revealed the cover for their fifteenth studio album, which would be named Quadra. They also played the lead single, named \\"Isolation\\", which is also the opening track for the album. On November 8, they released the studio version of \\"Isolation\\" and announced that Quadra would be released on February 7, 2020. Sepultura will promote the album by touring the United States with Sacred Reich, Crowbar and Art of Shock. Musical style, influences, and legacy Sepultura's early influences were heavy metal and hard rock groups such as Kiss, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Mot√∂rhead, Iron Maiden, Venom, Celtic Frost, Twisted Sister and Whitesnake, as well as thrash metal bands like Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Sodom and Destruction and death metal bands Possessed and Death. They were also influenced by punk rock music, including bands such as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Discharge, S.O.D., Amebix and New Model Army. Andreas Kisser has affirmed that \\"without Slayer, Sepultura would never be possible\\". Sepultura's music comes in a wide range of heavy metal musical styles. The band has been described mainly as thrash metal and death metal.Rivadavia, Eduardo. [ \\"Schizophrenia - Sepultura\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved May 11, 2005. Another genre the band has been commonly categorized under is groove metal.Best Sepultura Albums by Dan Marsicano - Retrieved on 11/20/2014 The band later on started experimenting elements of other musical genres such as hardcore punk, industrial metal, alternative metal, world music and nu metal. Looking back on the band's career arc for a 2016 article on Max and Igor Cavalera's retrospective Return to Roots tour (in commemoration of the album's 20th anniversary), Nashville Scene contributor Saby Reyes-Kulkarni observed that \\"Before Chaos A.D., the overwhelming majority of metal had a 'white' feel to it. Sepultura changed that forever. And with Roots, the band went a step further, asserting once and for all that the genre can accommodate native stylings from any culture, much like jazz had done for decades prior.\\" MTV has called Sepultura the most successful Brazilian heavy metal band in history and \\"perhaps the most important heavy metal band of the '90s\\". In 1993, Robert Baird of Phoenix New Times wrote that the band played \\"machine-gun-tempo mayhem\\" and that the members \\"love to attack organized religion and repressive government\\". A number of bands have cited Sepultura as an influence, including Slipknot, Korn, Hatebreed, Alien Weaponry, Krisiun, Gojira, Between the Buried and Me, Xibalba, Vein, Toxic Holocaust, Code Orange, Puya and Nails.

Structure=Muscle = The muscular part of the uvula () shortens and broadens the uvula. This changes the contour of the posterior part of the soft palate. This change in contour allows the soft palate to adapt closely to the posterior pharyngeal wall to help close the nasopharynx during swallowing.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 108 Its muscles are controlled by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. =Variation= The bifid uvula of a 24-year-old woman A bifid or bifurcated uvula is a split or cleft uvula. Newborns with cleft palate often also have a split uvula. The bifid uvula results from incomplete fusion of the palatine shelves but it is considered only a slight form of clefting. Bifid uvulas have less muscle in them than a normal uvula, which may cause recurring problems with middle ear infections. While swallowing, the soft palate is pushed backwards, preventing food and drink from entering the nasal cavity. If the soft palate cannot touch the back of the throat while swallowing, food and drink can enter the nasal cavity. Splitting of the uvula occurs infrequently but is the most common form of mouth and nose area cleavage among newborns. Bifid uvula occurs in about 2% of the general population, although some populations may have a high incidence, such as Native Americans who have a 10% rate. Bifid uvula is a common symptom of the rare genetic syndrome Loeys‚ÄìDietz syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm. Function During swallowing, the soft palate and the uvula move together to close off the nasopharynx, and prevent food from entering the nasal cavity. It has also been proposed that the abundant amount of thin saliva produced by the uvula serves to keep the throat well lubricated. It has a function in speech as well. In many languages, the uvula is used to articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as uvular consonants. The voiced uvular trill, written in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one example; it is used in French, Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages. Due to the large amount of saliva produced from glands in the uvula that are not present in other mammals it has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech organ. Stimulation of the uvula also causes the gag reflex to initiate. This is often a problem for people with uvula piercings, and a common method of inducing vomiting. Clinical significance=Inflammation= A swollen uvula with additional upper mouth ulcer in a run-down adult (common cold) At times, the mucous membrane around the uvula may swell, causing the uvula to expand 3‚Äì5 times its normal size. This condition is known as uvulitis. When the uvula touches the throat or tongue, it can cause sensations like gagging or choking, although there is no foreign matter present. This can cause problems with breathing, talking, and eating. There are many theories about what causes the uvula to swell, including dehydration (e.g. from arid weather); excessive smoking or other inhaled irritants; snoring; allergic reaction; or a viral or bacterial infection. An aphthous ulcer which has formed on the uvula can also cause swelling and discomfort. If the swelling is caused by dehydration, drinking fluids may improve the condition. If the cause is a bacterial infection, gargling salt water may help. However, it can also be a sign of other problems. Some people with a history of recurring uvulitis carry an epinephrine autoinjector to counteract symptoms of an attack. A swollen uvula is not normally life-threatening and subsides in a short time, typically within a day. =Snoring and sleep apnea= The uvula can also contribute to snoring or heavy breathing during sleep; having an elongated uvula can cause vibrations that lead to snoring. In some cases this can lead to sleep apnea, which may be treated by removal of the uvula or part of it if necessary, an operation known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (commonly referred to as UPPP, or UP3). However, this operation can also cause sleep apnea if scar tissue forms and the airspace in the velopharynx is decreased. The success of UPPP as a treatment for sleep apnea is unknown, but some research has shown 40‚Äì60% effectiveness in reducing symptoms. Typically apnea subsides for the short term, but returns over the medium to long term, and sometimes is worse than it was before the UPPP. =Velopharyngeal insufficiency= In a small number of people, the uvula does not close properly against the back of the throat, causing a condition known as velopharyngeal insufficiency. This causes \\"nasal\\" (or more properly \\"hyper-nasal\\") speech, where extra air comes down the nose, and the speaker is unable to say certain consonants, such as pronouncing 'b' like 'm'. =Nasal regurgitation= During swallowing, the soft palate and the uvula move superiorly to close off the nasopharynx, preventing food from entering the nasal cavity. When this process fails, the result is called nasal regurgitation. It is common in people with VPI, the myositides, and neuromuscular disease. Regurgitation of fluids in this way may also occur if a particularly high volume of liquid is regurgitated, or during vigorous coughing, for example being caused by the accidental inhalation of water. Due to the action of coughing preventing the uvula from blocking the nasopharynx, liquid may be expelled back through the nose. Society and culture A child's swollen uvula with tonsils In some parts of Africa, including Ethiopia and Eritrea, the uvula or a section of it is ritually removed by a traditional healer.Ethiopian Refugees In this case, the uvula may be noticeably shortened. It is not thought to contribute to velopharyngeal inadequacy, except in cases where the tonsils have also been removed.

The Tay originates in western Scotland on the slopes of Ben Lui (), then flows easterly across the Highlands, through Loch Dochart, Loch Iubhair and Loch Tay, then continues east through Strathtay (see Strath), in the centre of Scotland, then southeasterly through Perth, where it becomes tidal, to its mouth at the Firth of Tay, south of Dundee. It is the largest river in the UK by measured discharge. Its catchment is approximately , the Tweed's is and the Spey's is . Course Catchment of the River Tay within Scotland. Catchment of the River Tay. Tributaries of the River Tay. The Tay drains much of the lower region of the Highlands. It originates on the slopes of Ben Lui (Beinn Laoigh), only around from the west coast town of Oban, in Argyll and Bute. In 2011, the Tay Western Catchments Partnership determined as its source (as based on its 'most dominant and longest' tributary) a small lochan on Allt Coire Laoigh south of the summit. The river has a variety of names in its upper catchment: for the first few miles it is known as the River Connonish; then the River Fillan; the name then changes to the River Dochart until it flows into Loch Tay at Killin. The River Tay emerges from Loch Tay at Kenmore, and flows from there to Perth which, in historical times, was its lowest bridging point. Below Perth the river becomes tidal and enters the Firth of Tay. The largest city on the river, Dundee, lies on the north bank of the Firth. On reaching the North Sea, the River Tay has flowed from west to east across central Scotland. The Tay is unusual amongst Scottish rivers in having several major tributaries, notably the Earn, the Isla, the River Tummel, the Almond and the Lyon. A flow of was recorded on 17 January 1993, when the river rose above its usual level at Perth, and caused extensive flooding in the city. Were it not for the hydro-electric schemes upstream which impounded runoff, the peak would have been considerably higher. The highest flood recorded at Perth occurred in 1814, when the river rose above its usual level, partly caused by a blockage of ice under Smeaton's Bridge. Several places along the Tay take their names from it, or are believed to have done so: *Broughty - Bruach Tatha, Bank of the Tay *Taymouth - Near the mouth of Loch Tay. *Tayside - A former Scottish Government region Nature and conservation Tayside beaver with her kit. Courtesy of Ray Scott 2010. The river is of high biodiversity value and is both a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation. The SAC designation notes the river's importance for salmon (Salmo salar), otters (Lutra lutra), brook lampreys (Lampetra planeri), river lampreys (Lampetra fluviatilis), and sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus). The Tay also maintains flagship population of Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). Freshwater pearl mussels are one of Scotland's most endangered species and the country hosts two-thirds of the world's remaining stock. The Tay is internationally renowned for its salmon fishing and is one of the best salmon rivers in the United Kingdom, and western Europe, attracting anglers from all over the world. The lowest ten miles of the Tay, including prestigious beats like Taymount or Islamouth, provides most of the cream of the Tay. The largest rod caught salmon in Britain, caught on the Tay by Miss Georgina Ballantine in 1922, weighing , retains the British record. The river system has salmon fisheries on many of its tributaries including the Earn, Isla, Ericht, Tummel, Garry, Dochart, Lyon and Eden. Dwindling catches include a 50% reduction in 2009 so the Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board ordered a catch-and-release policy for females all season, and for males until May, beginning in the January 2010 fishing season. Research by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation has shown that the number of salmon dying at sea has doubled or trebled over the past 20 years, possibly due to overfishing in the oceans where salmon spend two years before returning to freshwater to spawn. The widespread collapse in Atlantic salmon stocks suggests that this is not solely a local problem in the River Tay. A section of the Tay surrounding the town of Dunkeld is designated as a national scenic area (NSA), one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. The River Tay (Dunkeld) NSA covers 5,708 ha. The first sustained and significant population Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) living wild in Scotland in over 400 years became established on the river Tay catchment in Scotland as early as 2001, and has spread widely in the catchment, numbering from 20 to 100 individuals in 2011. These beavers were likely to be either escapees from any of several nearby sites with captive beavers, or were illegally released, and were originally targeted for removal by Scottish Natural Heritage in late 2010. Proponents of the beavers argued that no reason exists to believe that they are of \\"wrong\\" genetic stock. In early December 2010, the first of the wild Tayside beavers was trapped by Scottish Natural Heritage on the River Ericht in Blairgowrie, Perthshire and was held in captivity in Edinburgh Zoo, dying within a few months. In March 2012 the Scottish Government reversed the decision to remove beavers from the Tay, pending the outcome of studies into the suitability of re-introduction. As part of the study into re-introduction, a trial release project was undertaken in Knapdale, Argyll, alongside which the population of beavers along the Tay was monitored and assessed. Following the conclusion of the trial re-introduction, the Scottish Government announced in November 2016 that beavers could remain permanently, and would be given protected status as a native species within Scotland. Beavers will be allowed to extend their range naturally. To aid this process and improve the health and resilience of the population a further 28 beavers will be released in Knapdale between 2017 and 2020, however there are no plans at present to release further beavers into the Tay. Transport Tay Bridge from the South after the accident In the 19th century the Tay Rail Bridge was built across the firth at Dundee as part of the East Coast Main Line, which linked Aberdeen in the north with Edinburgh and London to the south. The bridge, designed by Sir Thomas Bouch, officially opened in May 1878. On 28 December 1879 the bridge collapsed as a train passed over. The entire train fell into the firth, with the loss of 75 passengers and train crew. The event was commemorated in a poem, The Tay Bridge Disaster (1880), written by William McGonagall, a notoriously unskilled Scottish poet. The critical response to his article was enhanced as he had previously written two poems celebrating the strength and certain immortality of the Tay Bridge. A second much more well received poem was published in the same year by the German writer Theodor Fontane.Edward C. Smith III: The Collapse of the Tay Bridge: Theodor Fontane, William McGonagall, and the Poetic Response to the Humanity's First Technologocal Disaster. In: Ray Broadus Browne (ed.), Arthur G. Neal (ed.): Ordinary Reactions to Extraordinary Events. Popular Press (Ohio State University), 2001, , pp. 182-193 A. J. Cronin's first novel, Hatter's Castle (1931), includes a scene involving the Tay Bridge Disaster, and the 1942 filmed version of the book recreates the bridge's catastrophic collapse. The rail bridge was rebuilt, with the replacement bridge opening on 11 June 1887. A passenger and vehicle ferry service operated across the River Tay between Craig Pier, Dundee and Newport-on-Tay in Fife. In Dundee, the ferries were known as \\"the Fifies\\". The service was discontinued on the opening of the Tay Road Bridge on 18 August 1966. The last vessels to operate the service were PS B. L. Nairn and two more modern ferries equipped with Voith Schneider Propellers, MVs Abercraig and Scotscraig. Cultural references The Tay is mentioned in William McGonagall's poems \\"The Tay Bridge Disaster\\" and \\"Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay\\" and the German poet Theodor Fontane has mentioned the Tay in his poem \\"Die Br√ºck' am Tay. Both poems deal with the Tay bridge disaster of 1879, seeing the bridge's construction as a case of human hubris and expressing an uneasiness towards the fast technological development of mankind. It is mentioned in the Steeleye Span song \\"The Royal Forester\\". Symphonic power metal band Gloryhammer mentioned the 'mighty river Tay' in their 2019 song \\"The Land of Unicorns\\".

It connects the O'Connell Bridge to the south with Parnell Street to the north, and is roughly split into two sections bisected by Henry Street. The Luas tram system runs along the street. During the 17th century, it was a narrow street known as Drogheda Street, named after Henry Moore, Earl of Drogheda. It was widened in the late 18th century by the Wide Streets Commission and renamed Sackville Street (Sr√°id Saicfil) after Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset. In 1924, it was renamed in honour of Daniel O'Connell, a nationalist leader of the early 19th century, whose statue stands at the lower end of the street, facing O'Connell Bridge. The street has played an important part in Irish history and features several important monuments, including statues of O'Connell and union leader James Larkin, and the Dublin Spire. It formed the backdrop to one of the 1913 Dublin Lockout gatherings, the 1916 Easter Rising, the Irish Civil War of 1922, the destruction of the Nelson Pillar in 1966 and the Dublin Riots in 2006. In the late 20th century, a comprehensive plan was began to restore the street back to its original 19th century character. Construction Sackville Street and Gardiner's Mall in the 1750s O'Connell Street evolved from the earlier 17th-century Drogheda Street, laid out by Henry Moore, 1st Earl of Drogheda. It was a third of the width of the present-day O'Connell Street, located on the site of the modern eastern carriageway and extending from Parnell Street to the junction with Abbey Street. In the 1740s, the banker and property developer Luke Gardiner acquired the upper part of Drogheda Street extending down to Henry Street as part of a land deal. He demolished the western side of Drogheda Street creating an exclusive elongated residential square long and wide, thus establishing the scale of the modern-day thoroughfare. A number of properties were built along the new western side of the street, while the eastern side had many mansions, the grandest of which was Drogheda House rented by the sixth Earl of Drogheda. Gardiner also laid out a mall down the central section of the street, lined with low granite walls and obelisks. It was planted with trees a few years later. He titled the new development Sackville Street after the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Lionel Cranfield Sackville, Duke of Dorset. It was also known as 'Sackville Mall', and 'Gardiner's Mall'. However, due to the limited lands owned by the Gardiners in this area, the Rotunda Hospital sited just off the street at the bottom of Parnell Square ‚Äì also developed by the family ‚Äì was not built on axis with Sackville Street, terminating the vista. It had been Gardiner's intention to connect the new street through to the river, however, he died in 1755, with his son Charles taking over the estate. Work did not start until 1757, when the city's planning body, the Wide Streets Commission, obtained a financial grant from Parliament. For the next 10 years work progressed in demolishing a myriad of dwellings and other buildings, laying out the new roadway and building new terraces. The Wide Streets Commission had envisaged and realised marching terraces of unified and proportioned fa√ßades extending from the river. Because of a dispute over land, a plot on the northwest of the street remained vacant; this later became the General Post Office (GPO) which opened in 1814. The street became a commercial success upon the opening of Carlisle Bridge, designed by James Gandon, in 1792 for pedestrians and 1795 for all traffic. 19th century Sackville Street in 1842 Sackville Street prospered in the 19th century, though there were some difference between the Upper and Lower streets. Lower Sackville Street became successful as a commercial location; its terraces ambitiously lined with purpose-designed retail units. As a result, a difference between the two ends of the street developed: the planned lower end successful and bustling next to the river, and the upper end featuring a mixture of less prominent businesses and old townhouses. Upon his visit to Dublin in 1845, William Makepeace Thackeray observed the street was \\"broad and handsome\\" but noted the upper section featured less distinctive architecture and had a distinct lack of patronage. View of the Pillar and General Post Office c. 1830. During the 19th century, Sackville street changed in character from the Wide Streets Commission design into a boulevard of individual buildings. One of the world's first purpose-built department stores was such a building: Delany's New Mart 'Monster Store' which opened in 1853 was later purchased by the Clery family. It also housed the Imperial Hotel. Across the road, another elaborate hotel was built next to the GPO: the Hotel Metropole, in a high-French style. Similarly, the Gresham Hotel opened on Nos. 21‚Äì22 in 1817 to the north of the street in adjoining Georgian townhouses and was later remodelled, as it became more successful. Trams on Sackville Street As the fortunes of Upper Sackville Street began to improve in the second half of the century, other businesses began to open such as Turkish baths, later to be incorporated into the Hammam Hotel. Standard Life Assurance built their flagship Dublin branch on the street, while the Findlater family opened a branch of their successful chain close to Parnell Street, as did Gilbey's Wine Merchants. The thoroughfare also became the centre of the Dublin tramways system, with many of the city's trams converging at the Nelson Pillar. By 1900, Sackville Street had become an important location for shopping and business, which led to it being called \\"Ireland's Main Street\\". During the 19th century, the street began to be known as \\"O'Connell Street\\" though this was to be considered its \\"nationalist\\" name. Thus, the Dublin Corporation was anxious as early as the 1880s to change the name, but faced considerable objections from local residents, who in 1884 secured a Court order that the Corporation lacked the powers to make the change. The necessary powers were granted in 1890, but presumably, it was felt best to allow the new name to become popular. Over the years the name O'Connell Street gradually gained popular acceptance, and the name was changed officially, without any protest, in 1924. Easter Rising and Independence Buildings in Lower O'Connell Street, constructed between 1918 and 1923 On 31 August 1913, O'Connell Street saw the worst incident in the Dublin lock-out, a major dispute between workers and the police. During a speech given by workers' rights activist James Larkin, police charged through the attending crowd and arrested him. The crowd began to riot, resulting in two deaths, 200 arrests and numerous injuries. During the Easter Rising of 1916, Irish republicans seized the General Post Office and proclaimed the Irish Republic, leading to the street's bombardment for a number of days by the gunboat Helga of the Royal Navy and several other artillery pieces which were brought up to fire on the north of the street. The thoroughfare also saw sustained small arms and sniper fire from surrounding areas. By Saturday, the rebels had been forced to abandon the GPO, which was burning, and held out in Moore Street until they surrendered. Much of the street was reduced to rubble, the damaged areas including the whole eastern side of the street as far north as Cathedral Street, and the terrace in between the GPO and Abbey Street on the western side. In addition, during the chaos that accompanied the rebellion, the inhabitants of the nearby slums looted many of the shops on O'Connell Street. The events had a disastrous impact on the commercial life of the inner city, causing around ¬£2.5 million worth of damage. Some businesses were closed up to 1923, or never reopened. In the immediate aftermath of the Rising, the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916 was drafted with the aim of controlling the nature of reconstruction on the local area. The aim was to rebuild in a coherent and dignified fashion, using the opportunity to modernise the nature of commercial activity. Under the act, the city was to approve all construction and reject anything that would not fit with the street's character. The reconstruction was supervised and by City Architect Horace T. O'Rourke. With the exception of its Sackville Street fa√ßade and portico, the General Post Office was destroyed. A new GPO was subsequently built behind the 1818 fa√ßade. Work began in 1924, with the Henry Street side the first to be erected with new retail units at street level, a public shopping arcade linking through to Princes Street, and new offices on the upper floors. The Public Office underneath the portico on O'Connell Street reopened in 1929. Clerys department store, rebuilt in 1922 O'Connell Street saw another pitched battle in July 1922, on the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, when anti-treaty fighters under Oscar Traynor occupied the street after pro-treaty Irish National Army troops attacked the republican garrison in the nearby Four Courts. Fighting lasted from 28 June until 5 July, when the National Army troops brought artillery up to point- blank range, under the cover of armoured cars, to bombard the Republican-held buildings. Among the casualties was Cathal Brugha, shot at close range. The effects of the week's fighting were largely confined to the northern end of the street, with the vast majority of the terrace north of Cathedral Street to Parnell Square being destroyed, as well as a few buildings on the north- western side. In total, around three-quarters of the properties on the street were destroyed or demolished between 1916 and 1922. As a result, only one Georgian townhouse remains on the street into the 21st century. Because of the extensive destruction and rebuilding, most of the buildings on O'Connell Street date from the early 20th century. The only remaining original building still standing is No. 42 which now houses part of the Royal Dublin Hotel. Apart from the GPO building, other significant properties rebuilt after the hostilities include the department store Clerys which reopened in August 1922. and the Gresham Hotel which reopened in 1927. Regeneration Despite improvements to the street's architectural coherence between 1916 and 1922, the street has since suffered from a lack of planning. Like much of Dublin of that time, property speculators and developers were allowed to construct what were widely accepted to be inappropriately designed buildings, often entailing the demolition of historic properties in spite of its Conservation Area status. Several Victorian and 1920s buildings were demolished in the 1970s including Gilbey's at the northern end in 1972, the Metropole and Capitol cinemas next to the GPO, and the last intact Wide Streets Commission buildings on the street dating from the 1780s. They were replaced with a number of fast food restaurants, shops and offices, that continue to be the main features along O'Connell Street in the 21st century. The street was given attention with Dublin City Council's O'Connell Street Integrated Area Plan (IAP) which was unveiled in 1998 with the aim of restoring the street to its former status. The plan was designed to go beyond simple cosmetic changes, and introduce control of the wider area beyond the street's buildings, including pedestrian and vehicle interaction, governance and preservation of architecture. Work on the plan was delayed, and reached approval in June 2003. The main features of the plan included the widening of footpaths and a reduction in road space, removing and replacing all trees, a new plaza in front of the GPO, and new street furnishings including custom-designed lampposts, litter bins and retail kiosks. The plan included the Spire of Dublin project, Dublin's tallest sculpture; constructed between December 2002 and January 2003, occupying the site of Nelson's Pillar. Numerous monuments were restored, including those of late 19th century Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell, radical early 20th-century labour leader Jim Larkin, prominent businessman and nationalist MP Sir John Grey, and the most challenging of all: the conservation of the O'Connell Monument standing guard at the southern entrance to the thoroughfare. This project was worked on for a number of months by an expert team of bronze and stone conservators before being unveiled in May 2005. All public domain works were completed in June 2006, finalising the principal objective of the IAP at a cost of ‚Ç¨40 million. Work was disrupted by a riot centred on the street which erupted on 25 February 2006. A protest against a planned Loyalist march degenerated into vandalism and looting, with building materials from the works in progress being used as weapons and for smashing windows and fixtures. O'Connell Street has been designated an Architectural Conservation Area and an Area of Special Planning Control. This means that no buildings can be altered without Dublin City Council's permission, and fast food outlets, takeaways, cafes and amusement arcades are strictly controlled. In June 2015, Clerys suddenly closed after it was bought out by investment group Natrium Ltd, with the loss of over 400 jobs. In 2019, plans were announced to turn the premises into a four-star hotel. The street is used as the main route of the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, and as the setting for the 1916 Commemoration every Easter Sunday. It also serves as a major bus route artery through the city centre. The modern tram, the Luas, has undergone an extension and trams now run once again through O'Connell Street. It only travels in one direction, the return loop, to link the system at St. Stephen's Green, runs via Marlborough Street, parallel with and east of O'Connell Street. Statues Sir John Gray, designed by Thomas Farrell and erected in 1879. Current and former monuments on O'Connell Street from south to north include: Daniel O'Connell: designed and sculpted by John Henry Foley and completed by his assistant Thomas Brock. Construction began in 1886 and the monument unveiled in 1883. William Smith O'Brien: by Thomas Farrell. Originally erected in 1870 on an island at the O'Connell Bridge entrance to D'Olier Street, it was moved to O'Connell Street in 1929. Parnell Monument at the north end of O'Connell Street. Sir John Gray: by Thomas Farrell. Both plinth and statue carved entirely of white Sicilian marble, it was unveiled in 1879. Gray was the proprietor of the Freeman's Journal newspaper and as a member of Dublin Corporation was responsible for the construction of the Dublin water supply system based on the Vartry Reservoir. James Larkin: by Ois√≠n Kelly. A bronze statue atop a Wicklow granite plinth, the monument was unveiled in 1980. Anna Livia: by Eamonn O'Doherty. Constructed in granite and unveiled on 17 June 1988, it became quickly known for its nickname \\"The Floosy in the Jacuzzi\\". It was removed in 2001 as part of the reconstruction plans for O'Connell Street and moved to the Croppies' Acre Memorial Park in 2011. Nelson's Pillar, a 36.8 m (121 ft) granite Doric column erected in 1808 in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson, formerly stood at the centre of the street on the site of the present-day Spire of Dublin. Blown up by republican activists in 1966, the site remained vacant until the erection of the Spire in 2003. Father Theobald Mathew: by Mary Redmond. The foundation stone was laid in 1890, and the monument unveiled in 1893. In 2016, the statue was removed to cater for the Luas tram extension to the north of the city. Charles Stewart Parnell: Parnell Monument by Irish- American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The 37 ft high obelisk sits on a Galway granite pylon, was organised by John Redmond and paid for through public subscription and unveiled in 1911 at the junction with Parnell Street, just south of Parnell Square.

Description The Spire looking towards the Liffey The spire was designed by Ian Ritchie Architects, who sought an \\"Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology\\". The contract was awarded to SIAC-Radley JV and it was manufactured by Radley Engineering of Dungarvan, County Waterford, and erected by SIAC Construction Ltd & GDW Engineering Ltd. The first section was installed on 18 December 2002. Construction of the sculpture was delayed because of difficulty in obtaining planning permission and environmental regulations. The Spire consists of eight hollow stainless steel cone sections, the longest being , which were installed on 21 January 2003. It is an elongated cone of diameter at the base, narrowing to at the top. It features two tuned mass dampers, designed by engineers Arup, to counteract sway. The steel underwent shot peening to alter the quality of light reflected from it. The pattern around the base of the Spire is based on a core sample of rock formation taken from the ground where the spire stands and the DNA double helix. The pattern was applied by bead blasting the steel through rubber stencil masks whose patterns were created by water jet cutting based on core sample drawings supplied by the contractor. The design around the lower part of the Spire was created by the architects making a 3D pattern model combining the core sample and double helix and then digitally translated to a 2D image drawing supplied to the contractor and used by specialists for cutting the masking material. At dusk, the base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated through 11,884 holes through which light-emitting diodes shine. Context Nelson's Pillar stood on the site of the Spire until it was destroyed by a bomb in 1966. The monument was commissioned as part of a street layout redesign in 1999. O'Connell Street had been in decline for a number of reasons such as the proliferation of fast food restaurants and the opening of bargain shops using cheap plastic shop fronts which were unattractive and obtrusive; the existence of derelict sites; and the destruction in 1966 of Nelson's Pillar following a bombing by former IRA members. The Anna Livia monument was installed on the site for the 1988 Dublin Millennium celebrations. In the 1990s, plans were launched to improve the streetscape. The number of trees in the central reservation, which had overgrown and obscured views and monuments, was reduced dramatically. This was controversial, as the trees had been growing for a century. Statues were cleaned and in some cases relocated. Shop-owners were required to replace plastic signage and frontage with more attractive designs. Traffic was re- directed where possible away from the street and the number of traffic lanes was reduced to make it more appealing to pedestrians. The centrepiece of this regeneration was to be a replacement monument for Nelson's Pillar, the Spire of Dublin, chosen from a large number of submissions in an international competition by a committee chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Joe Doyle. The Anna Livia monument was moved to make way for the Spire in 2001. Reception Some opposition initially greeted the monument. Supporters compare it to other initially unpopular urban structures such as the Eiffel Tower, while detractors complain that the Spire has little architectural or cultural connection to the city. It has inspired a number of nicknames, as is common with public art in Dublin, including the nail in the Pale, the stiletto in the ghetto, the pin in the bin, the spike, the spire in the mire, the stiffy by the Liffey, and the erection at the intersection.

Fraktur () is a calligraphic hand of the Latin alphabet and any of several blackletter typefaces derived from this hand. The blackletter lines are broken up; that is, their forms contain many angles when compared to the curves of the Antiqua (common) typefaces modeled after antique Roman square capitals and Carolingian minuscule. From this, Fraktur is sometimes contrasted with the \\"Latin alphabet\\" in northern European texts, which is sometimes called the \\"German alphabet\\", simply being a typeface of the Latin alphabet. Similarly, the term \\"Fraktur\\" or \\"Gothic\\" is sometimes applied to all of the blackletter typefaces (known in German as , \\"Broken Script\\"). The word derives from Latin (\\"a break\\"), built from , passive participle of (\\"to break\\"), the same root as the English word \\"fracture\\". Characteristics Besides the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet,ISO basic Latin alphabet is derived from the English alphabet hence its 26 letters. Fraktur includes the √ü ( ), vowels with umlauts, and the ≈ø (long s). Some Fraktur typefaces also include a variant form of the letter r known as the r rotunda, and many a variety of ligatures which are left over from cursive handwriting and have rules for their use. Most older Fraktur typefaces make no distinction between the majuscules \\"I\\" and \\"J\\" (where the common shape is more suggestive of a \\"J\\"), even though the minuscules \\"i\\" and \\"j\\" are differentiated. One difference between the Fraktur and other blackletter scripts is that in the lower case o, the left part of the bow is broken, but the right part is not. In Danish texts composed in Fraktur, the letter √∏ was already preferred to the German and Swedish √∂ in the 16th century.Compare, for example, . 1550. and . 1633. In the Latvian variant of Fraktur, used mainly until the 1920s, there are additional characters used to denote Latvian letters with diacritical marks:Example of old Latvian book, published in 1877 for palatalized consonants ƒ∂ ƒ∑, ƒª ƒº, ≈Ö ≈Ü, ≈ñ ≈ó and long vowels ƒÄ ƒÅ, ƒí ƒì, ≈™ ≈´, ƒ™ ƒ´. Origin The first Fraktur typeface arose in the early 16th century, when Emperor Maximilian I commissioned the design of the Triumphal Arch woodcut by Albrecht D√ºrer and had a new typeface created specifically for this purpose, designed by Hieronymus Andreae. Fraktur types for printing were established by the Augsburg publisher Johann Sch√∂nsperger at the issuance of a series of Maximilian's works such as his Prayer Book (, 1513) or the illustrated Theuerdank poem (1517). Fraktur quickly overtook the earlier Schwabacher and Textualis typefaces in popularity, and a wide variety of Fraktur fonts were carved and became common in the German-speaking world and areas under German influence (Scandinavia, the Baltic states, Central Europe). In the 18th century, the German Theuerdank Fraktur was further developed by the Leipzig typographer Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf to create the typeset Breitkopf Fraktur. While over the succeeding centuries, most Central Europeans switched to Antiqua, German speakers remained a notable holdout. Use Czech example of Fraktur: Title page of by Adam V√°clav Michna z Otradovic (1647) (\\"\\" by old orthography) Front page of Gustav Vasa's Bible from 1541, using Fraktur. The title translated to English reads: \\"The Bible / That is / All the Holy Scriptures / in Swedish. Printed in Uppsala. 1541\\". (Note the use of long s and \\"th\\", akin to English; it would later change to \\"d\\".) Typesetting in Fraktur was still very common in the early 20th century in all German-speaking countries and areas, as well as in Norway, Estonia, and Latvia, and was still used to a very small extent in Sweden, Finland and Denmark,In Denmark in 1902 the percentage of printed material using antiqua amounted to 95% according to R. Paulli, \\"Den sejrende antikva\\", i: Det trykte Ord, published by Grafisk Cirkel, Copenhagen, 1940. even though other countries typeset in Antiqua. Some books at that time used related blackletter fonts such as Schwabacher; however, the predominant typeface was the Normalfraktur, which came in slight variations. Usage map: A map presenting the contemporary German view of the extent of scripts around 1900. In reality only German-speakers, Estonia, and Latvia still used Fraktur as the majority script at this time. Denmark had shifted to antiqua during the mid 19th century,R. Paulli, \\"Den sejrende antikva\\", i: Det trykte Ord, published by Grafisk Cirkel, Copenhagen, 1940. and in Norway the majority of printed texts used antiqua around 1900. Notably, the map itself uses Antiqua for its legend, even though it is in German, indicating that Fraktur was no longer universally used even among German-speakers. From the late 18th century to the late 19th century, Fraktur was progressively replaced by Antiqua as a symbol of the classicist age and emerging cosmopolitanism in most of the countries in Europe that had previously used Fraktur. This move was hotly debated in Germany, where it was known as the Antiqua‚ÄìFraktur dispute. The shift affected mostly scientific writing in Germany, whereas most belletristic literature and newspapers continued to be printed in Fraktur. The Fraktur typefaces remained in use in Nazi Germany, when they were initially represented as true German script; official Nazi documents and letterheads employed the font, and the cover of Hitler's Mein Kampf used a hand-drawn version of it. However, more modernized fonts of the type such as Tannenberg were in fact the most popular typefaces in Nazi Germany, especially for running text as opposed to decorative uses such as in titles. These fonts were designed in the early 20th century, mainly the 1930s, as grotesque versions of blackletter typefaces. The Nazis heavily used these fonts themselves, though the shift remained controversial; in fact, the press was at times scolded for its frequent use of \\"Roman characters\\" under \\"Jewish influence\\" and German √©migr√©s were urged to use only \\"German script\\".Eric Michaud, The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany, tr. Janet Lloyd, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2004, , pp. 215‚Äì16 and Plate 110. On January 3, 1941, the Nazi Party ended this controversy by switching to international scripts such as Antiqua. Martin Bormann issued a circular to all public offices which declared Fraktur (and its corollary, the -based handwriting) to be (Jewish letters) and prohibited their further use.Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German) The memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the NSDAP letterhead is printed in Fraktur. \\"For general attention, on behalf of the , I make the following announcement: It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced. Today the , talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Book Publisher Adolf M√ºller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools. The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script. On behalf of the , Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script\\". German historian Albert Kapr has speculated that the regime viewed Fraktur as inhibiting communication in the occupied territories during World War II. =After 1941= Even with the abolition of Fraktur, some publications include elements of it in headlines. However, academic works occasionally continued to Fraktur in the text itself. Notably, Joachim Jeremias's work \\"Die Briefe an Timotheus und Titus\\" (The Letters to Timothy and Titus) was published in 1963 using Fraktur. More often, some ligatures ch, ck from Fraktur were used in antiqua-typed editions up to the offset type period. Fraktur saw a brief resurgence after the war, but thereafter fell out of common use. Fraktur is today used mostly for decorative typesetting: for example, a number of traditional German newspapers such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine, as well as the Norwegian Aftenposten, still print their name in Fraktur on the masthead (as indeed do some newspapers in other European countries and the U.S.) and it is also popular for pub signs and the like. In this modern decorative use, the traditional rules about the use of long s and short s and of ligatures are often disregarded. Individual Fraktur letters are sometimes used in mathematics, which often denotes associated or parallel concepts by the same letter in different fonts. For example, a Lie group is often denoted by G, while its associated Lie algebra is \\\\mathfrak{g}. A ring ideal might be denoted by \\\\mathfrak{a} (or \\\\mathfrak{p} if a prime ideal) while an element is a \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{a}. The Fraktur \\\\mathfrak c is also sometimes used to denote the cardinality of the continuum, that is, the cardinality of the real line. In model theory, \\\\mathfrak{A} is used to denote an arbitrary model, with A as its universe. Fraktur is also used in other ways at the discretion of the author. Fraktur is still used among traditional Anabaptists to print German texts, while Kurrent is used as hand writing for German texts. Groups that use both form of traditional German script are the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Hutterites and traditional German-speaking Mennonites from Russia who live today mostly in Latin America.

It means \\"Victor chases twelve boxers across the Sylt dike\\" and contains all 26 letters of the alphabet plus the umlauted glyphs used in German, making it an example of a pangram. Fig. 1. Walbaum-Fraktur (1800) Fig. 2. Humboldtfraktur (Hiero Rhode, 1938) Unicode Unicode does not encode Fraktur as a separate script. Instead, Fraktur is considered a class of fonts of the Latin alphabet. Thus, the additional ligatures that are required for Fraktur fonts will not be encoded in Unicode, and Unicode proposes to deal with these ligatures using smart-font technologies such as OpenType, AAT or Graphite. There are many Fraktur fonts that do not use smart-font technologies, but use their own legacy encoding instead that is not compliant with Unicode. There are, however, two sets of \\"Fraktur\\" symbols in the Unicode blocks of Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols, Letterlike Symbols, and Latin Extended-E. These are meant to be used only in mathematics and phonetics, so they are not suitable for typesetting German-language texts, as letters such as long s, √§, √∂, √º, and √ü are not encoded.

The word literally means \\"sanctuary,\\" commonly used by Muslims to refer to the holy sites of Islam and the area surrounding them, within which the entry of non-Muslims is not permitted. In addition to the restriction on movement of non-Muslims, there are several other rules which Muslims within the area must follow. Another meaning of the word which was used in the past but has since fallen out of use, include an \\"inviolable/protected zone,\\" referring to an area in which the number of residing families was limited, attributed to the idea of carrying capacity and early forms of nature reserves, and to the prayer hall of the mosque. Etymology The Arabic language has two separate words, ·∏•aram () and ·∏•arƒÅm () both derived from the same triliteral Semitic root ·∏§-R-M. Both of these words can mean \\"forbidden\\" and/or \\"sacred\\" in a general way, but each has also developed some specialized meanings (·∏•arƒÅm most often means \\"forbidden by law\\"). A third related word derived from the same root, that is ·∏•arƒ´m (), most directly corresponds to English \\"harem\\". This article covers the word ·∏•aram (with short vowels in the singular form). In Islam=Protected zone= Great Mosque of Kairouan (also called the Mosque of Uqba) which is located in the historic city of Kairouan in Tunisia, North Africa As used in Islamic urban planning, the word ·∏•aram means \\"inviolate zone\\", an important aspect of urban planning in Muslim civilization. Such protected areas were sanctuaries, or places where contending parties could settle disputes peacefully. Towns were usually built near a river which provided drinking and domestic water (upstream) and carried away waste and sewage (downstream). Muslims claim to have introduced the idea of carrying capacity, and clearly sometimes did limit the number of families in any given town. The harams were typically positioned to ensure access to parkland and nature (which were given another name, hima), to restrict urban sprawl, protect water-courses and watersheds and oases. In this respect the rules strongly resembled modern zoning laws, with the same purposes. The distinction between haram and hima is thought by some modern scholars to have been necessary due to a different means of deciding which regions were to have restrictions - the selection of haram was considered to be more up to the community while the selection of hima had more to do with natural characteristics of the region, which were considered to be best respected by jurists. This idea probably arises from two different obligations of the Muslim to respect the ijmƒÅ‚Äò (, consensus of neighbors within Islam) and practice khil√¢fah (, stewardship of nature under Allah). It may or may not reflect actual means of decision making historically. As a protected and inviolate zone, haram is also employed referring to the consecrated space in a mosque where rituals and prayer take place: it is the prayer hall.Henri Stierlin and Anne Stierlin, Islam: Early architecture from Baghdad to C√≥rdoba, Taschen, 1996, p. 235 =Holy site= ·∏§aram can also mean a site of high sanctity. The two sites whose Islamic sanctity are unchallengeably the highest of all are Al-Haram Mosque in Mecca (which is called ·∏§araman ƒÄminan (, \\"Sanctuary (which is) Secure\\") in the Quran (28:57; 29:67)), and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, so the Arabic dual form al-·∏•aramƒÅn () or al-·∏•aramayn () refers to these two places,Freidun Emecen, Selim I, TDV ƒ∞slam Ansiklopedisi, Vol.36, p.413-414. (In Turkish) both of which are in the Hejazi region of the Arabian Peninsula. Since 1986, the Saudi monarchy has disclaimed all royal titles except \\"Custodian of the Two Holy Sanctuaries\\" or \\"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\\" (). In addition, the term ·∏•aram is commonly used to refer to certain other holy sites, such as the Temple Mount () in Jerusalem ‚Äî though over the protests of some, such as Ibn Taymiyyah, who declared that the only places which could be legitimately called \\"·∏•aram\\" were Mecca, Medina, and probably also the valley of Wajj in Ta'if, thus rejecting other places like Hebron and even Jerusalem. Includes Arabic text of manuscript of Ibn Taymiyya's short work [']. In fact, one of the Islamic names of Jerusalem, thƒÅlith al-·∏•aramayn (, literally \\"the third of the two holy places\\") resolves the tension between the unchallengeable pre-eminence of Mecca and Medina versus the desire to recognize Jerusalem as having a special status in Islam in a somewhat paradoxical manner. Jerusalem, being home to Al-Aqsa Mosque (one of the few mosques that are mentioned by name in the Quran, and consequently one of the most important mosques) is normally seen as being holy in its own right.

Directly referenced is Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 49, stating: Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir: I heard Allah's Messenger (pbuh) saying, \\"Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them are doubtful (unclear) things, and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these unclear things, he saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these unclear things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (the private pasture) of someone else, and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah (SwtA) on earth is His illegal things (ie, His forbidden things). Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (ie, reformed), the whole body becomes good, but if it gets spoiled, the whole body gets spoiled and that is the heart.\\" A ·∏•ima ( ') \\"inviolate zone\\" refers to an area set aside for the conservation of natural capital, typically fields, wildlife and forests - contrast ·∏•aram, which defines an area protected for more immediate human purposes. A Muslim has a specific obligation to practice stewardship over nature, and each species of animals is said to be \\"its own nation\\". \\"Human beings are God's representatives on earth. This means that if they are not charged with maintaining the world, or rending to it, they must at least not destroy it\\". The selection of ·∏•imas was thus a religious rather than community obligation, and was often undertaken by the ulema. There are five types of ·∏•ima: # areas where grazing of domestic animals is prohibited # areas where grazing is restricted to certain seasons # beekeeping reserves where grazing is restricted during flowering # forest areas where cutting of trees is forbidden # reserves managed for the welfare of a particular village, town or tribe (see also ·∏•aram, although that term usually refers more to water protection measures) There are good examples of ·∏•ima in the Middle East, some adopted by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

The laws also regulated England's fisheries and restricted foreigners' participation in its colonial trade.V Bevan, The Development of British Immigration Law (1986), p.91 While based on earlier precedents, they were first enacted in 1651 under the Commonwealth. The system was reenacted and broadened with the restoration by the Act of 1660, and further developed and tightened by the Navigation Acts of 1663, 1673, and 1696. Upon this basis during the 18th century, the Acts were modified by subsequent amendments, changes, and the addition of enforcement mechanisms and staff. Additionally, a major change in the very purpose of the Acts in the 1760s ‚Äî that of generating a colonial revenue, rather than only regulating the Empire's trade ‚Äî would help lead to major rebellions,Francis D. Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 1763-1815: A Political History, p.23 and significant changes in the implementation of the Acts themselves.Reeves 1792,p.274‚Äì277 The Acts generally prohibited the use of foreign ships, required the employment of English and colonial mariners for 75% of the crews, including East India Company ships. The Acts prohibited colonies from exporting specific, enumerated, products to countries and colonies other than those British, and mandated that imports be sourced only through Britain. Overall, the Acts formed the basis for English (and later) British overseas trade for nearly 200 years, but with the development and gradual acceptance of free trade, the Acts were eventually repealed in 1849. The laws reflected the European economic theory of mercantilism which sought to keep all the benefits of trade inside their respective Empires, and to minimize the loss of gold and silver, or profits, to foreigners through purchases and trade. The system would develop with the colonies supplying raw materials for British industry, and in exchange for this guaranteed market, the colonies would purchase manufactured goods from or through Britain. The major impetus for the first Navigation Act was the ruinous deterioration of English trade in the aftermath of the Eighty Years' War, and the associated lifting of the Spanish embargoes on trade between the Spanish Empire and the Dutch Republic. The end of the embargoes in 1647 unleashed the full power of the Amsterdam Entrep√¥t and other Dutch competitive advantages in European and world trade. Within a few years, English merchants had practically been overwhelmed in the Baltic and North sea trade, as well as trade with the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Levant. Even the trade with English colonies (partly still in the hands of the royalists, as the English Civil War was in its final stages and the Commonwealth of England had not yet imposed its authority throughout the English colonies) was \\"engrossed\\" by Dutch merchants. English direct trade was crowded out by a sudden influx of commodities from the Levant, Mediterranean and the Spanish and Portuguese empires, and the West Indies via the Dutch Entrep√¥t, carried in Dutch ships and for Dutch account.Israel (1997), pp. 305‚Äì309 The obvious solution seemed to be to seal off the English markets to these unwanted imports. A precedent was the Act the Greenland Company had obtained from Parliament in 1645 prohibiting the import of whale products into England, except in ships owned by that company. This principle was now generalized. In 1648 the Levant Company petitioned Parliament for the prohibition of imports of Turkish goods \\"...from Holland and other places but directly from the places of their growth.\\"Israel (1997), p. 309 Baltic traders added their voices to this chorus. In 1650 the Standing Council for Trade and the Council of State of the Commonwealth prepared a general policy designed to impede the flow of Mediterranean and colonial commodities via Holland and Zeeland into England.Israel (1997), pp. 309‚Äì310 Following the 1696 act, the Acts of Trade and Navigation were generally obeyed, except for the Molasses Act 1733, which led to extensive smuggling because no effective means of enforcement was provided until the 1760s. Stricter enforcement under the Sugar Act 1764 became one source of resentment of Great Britain by merchants in the American colonies. This, in turn, helped push the American colonies to rebel in the late 18th century, even though the consensus view among modern economic historians and economists is that the \\"costs imposed on [American] colonists by the trade restrictions of the Navigation Acts were small.\\" Historical precedents Some principles of English mercantile legislation pre-date both the passage of the Navigation Act 1651 and the settlement of England's early foreign possessions. A 1381 Act passed under King Richard II provided \\"that, to increase the navy of England, no goods or merchandises shall be either exported or imported, but only in ships belonging to the King's subjects.\\" The letters patent granted to the Cabots by Henry VII in 1498 stipulated that the commerce resulting from their discoveries must be with England (specifically Bristol).\\"1498 - The letters patent of King Henry the Seventh Granted unto Iohn Cabot and his Three Sonnes, Lewis, Sebastian and Santius for the Discouerie of New and Unknowen Lands; March 5\\" Henry VIII established a second principle by statute: that such a vessel must be English-built and a majority of the crew must be English-born. Legislation during the reign of Elizabeth I also dealt with these questions and resulted in a large increase in English merchant shipping.Charles McLean Andrews, Colonial Self-Government, 1652-1689, p.10 (1904) Soon after actual settlements had been made in America, these early requirements illustrate the English theory then held regarding the governmental control of maritime commerce.Chapter III - The Commercial Policy of England Toward the American Colonies: the Acts of Trade, in Emory R.

With the establishment of overseas colonies a distinct colonial policy began to develop, and the principles embodied in the early Navigation and Trade Acts also had some more immediate precedents in the provisions of the charters granted to the London and Plymouth Company, in the various royal patents later bestowed by Charles I and Charles II, as well as in the early regulations concerning the tobacco trade, the first profitable colonial export. An Order in Council of 24 October 1621 prohibited the Virginia colony to export tobacco and other commodities to foreign countries.Charles M. Andrews, British Committees, Commissions, and Councils of Trade and Plantations 1622-1675, 1908 The London Company lost its charter in 1624; the same year a proclamation, followed by Orders in Council, prohibited the use of foreign ships for the Virginia tobacco trade. These early companies held the monopoly on trade with their plantation; this meant that the commerce developed was to be England's. The Crown's purpose was to restrict to England the future commerce with America; it is well shown in the patent granted by Charles I to William Berkeley in 1639, by which the patentee was \\"to oblige the masters of vessels, freighted with productions of the colony, to give bond before their departure to bring same into England ... and to forbid all trade with foreign vessels, except upon necessity.\\" As early as 1641 some English merchants urged that these rules be embodied in an act of Parliament, and during the Long Parliament, movement began in that direction. The Ordinance for Free Trade with the plantations in New England was passed in November 1644. In 1645, both to conciliate the colonies and to encourage English shipping, the Long Parliament prohibited the shipment of whalebone, except in English-built ships;6 May 1645 Ordinance to prevent the importation by foreigners of whale oil, fins or gills, commonly called whalebone. they later prohibited the importation of French wine, wool, and silk from France.28 August 1649 Act prohibiting the importation of any Wines of the Growth of France, and all manufacturers of wool and silk made in France. More generally and significantly on 23 January 1647, they passed the Ordinance granting privileges for the encouragement of Adventurers to plantations in Virginia, Bermudas, Barbados, and other places of America; it enacted that for three years no export duty be levied on goods intended for the colonies, provided they were forwarded in English vessels. Adam Anderson noted that this law also included \\"security being given here, and certificates from thence, that the said goods be really exported thither, and for the only use of the said plantations\\". He concluded: \\"Hereby the foundation was laid for the navigation acts afterward, which may be justly termed the Commercial Palladium of Britain.\\"Anderson 1787, p.404 The English were well aware of their inferior competitive trading position. Three acts of the Rump Parliament in 1650 and 1651 are notable in the historical development of England's commercial and colonial programs. These include the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament on 1 August 1650, to advance and regulate the nation's trade.August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth. The instructions to the named commissioners included consideration of both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufacturers, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, but also the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. This act's statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions were followed by the October act prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies and the first Navigation Act the following October. These acts formed the first definitive expression of England's commercial policy. They represent the first attempt to establish a legitimate control of commercial and colonial affairs, and the instructions indicate the beginnings of a policy which had the prosperity and wealth of England exclusively at heart.Charles M. Andrews, British Committees, Commissions and Councils of Trade and Plantations 1622-1675, Chapter II, Control of Trade and Plantations During the Interregnum, p.24 (1908) The 1650 Act prohibiting trade with royalist colonies was broader, however, because it provided that all foreign ships were prohibited from trading with any English plantations, without license, and it was made lawful to seize and make prizes of any ships violating the act. This Act, sometimes referred to as the Navigation Act of 1650, was hastily passed as a war measure during the English Civil Wars, but it was followed by a more carefully conceived Act the following year. Navigation Act 1651 The Navigation Act 1651, long titled An Act for increase of Shipping, and Encouragement of the Navigation of this Nation, was passed on 9 October 1651 by the Rump Parliament led by Oliver Cromwell. It authorized the Commonwealth to regulate England's international trade, as well as the trade with its colonies. It reinforced long-standing principles of national policy that English trade and fisheries should be carried in English vessels. The Act banned foreign ships from transporting goods from Asia, Africa or America to England or its colonies; only ships with an English owner, master and a majority English crew would be accepted. It allowed European ships to import their own products, but banned foreign ships from transporting goods to England from a third country elsewhere in the European sphere. The Act also prohibited the import and export of salted fish in foreign ships, and penalized foreign ships carrying fish and wares between English posts. Breaking the terms of the act would result in the forfeiture of the ship and its cargo.October 1651: An Act for increase of Shipping, and Encouragement of the Navigation of this Nation., in Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660, ed. C H Firth and R S Rait (London, 1911), pp. 559-562. British History Online [accessed 7 July 2018]. These rules specifically targeted the Dutch, who controlled much of Europe's international trade and even much of England's coastal shipping. It excluded the Dutch from essentially all direct trade with England, as the Dutch economy was competitive with, not complementary to the English, and the two countries, therefore, exchanged few commodities. This Anglo-Dutch trade, however, constituted only a small fraction of total Dutch trade flows. Passage of the act was a reaction to the failure of the English diplomatic mission (led by Oliver St John and Walter Strickland) to The Hague seeking a political union of the Commonwealth with the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, after the States of Holland had made some cautious overtures to Cromwell to counter the monarchical aspirations of stadtholder William II of Orange.Godwin, William (1827). History of the Commonwealth of England Vol. 3. H. Colburn. pps.372-382. The stadtholder had suddenly died, however, and the States were now embarrassed by Cromwell taking the idea too seriously. The English proposed the joint conquest of all remaining Spanish and Portuguese possessions. England would take America and the Dutch would take Africa and Asia. But the Dutch had just ended their war with Spain and already taken over most Portuguese colonies in Asia, so they saw little advantage in this grandiose scheme and proposed a free trade agreement as an alternative to a full political union. This again was unacceptable to the British, who would be unable to compete on such a level playing field, and was seen by them as a deliberate affront. The Act is often mentioned as a major cause of the First Anglo-Dutch War, and though there were others,Anderson, (1762), p.415‚Äì416 it was only part of a larger British policy to engage in war after the negotiations had failed. The English naval victories in 1653 (the Battles of Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen) showed the supremacy of the Commonwealth navy in home waters. However, farther afield the Dutch predominated and were able to close down English commerce in the Baltic and the Mediterranean. Both countries held each other in a stifling embrace.Israel (1997), p. 316 The Treaty of Westminster (1654) ended the impasse. The Dutch failed to have the Act repealed or amended, but it seems to have had relatively little influence on their trade. The Act offered England only limited solace. It could not limit the deterioration of England's overseas trading position, except in the cases where England herself was the principal consumer, such as the Canaries wine trade and the trade in Puglian olive oil. In the trade with America and the West Indies, the Dutch kept up a flourishing \\"smuggling\\" trade, thanks to the preference of English planters for Dutch import goods and the better deal the Dutch offered in the sugar trade. The Dutch colony of New Netherlands offered a loophole (through intercolonial trade) wide enough to drive a shipload of Virginian tobacco through.Israel (1997), p.310-311 Post-restoration navigation acts to 1696 Like all laws of the Commonwealth period, the 1651 act was declared void on the Restoration of Charles II, having been passed by 'usurping powers'. Nonetheless with benefits of the act widely recognized, Parliament soon passed new legislation which enlarged its scope. While the act of 1651 applied only to shipping, or the ocean carrying business, the 1660 act was the most important piece of commercial legislation as it related to shipbuilding, to navigation, to trade, and to the benefit of the merchant class.Herbert Levi Osgood, The American colonies in the seventeenth century (3 vol 1904-07), p.207‚Äì209 The 1660 act is generally considered to be the basis of the \\"Navigation Acts\\", which (with later amendments, additions and exceptions) remained in force for nearly two centuries. The navigation acts entitled colonial shipping and seamen to enjoy the full benefits of the otherwise exclusively English provisions. \\"English bottoms\\" included vessels built in English plantations, particularly in America. There were no restrictions put in the way of English colonists who might wish to build or trade in their own ships to foreign plantations or other European countries besides England, provided they did not violate the enumerated commodity clause.Craven, p. 35 Some of the most important products of colonial America, including grain of all sorts and the fisheries of New England, were always non-enumerated commodities. =Navigation Act 1660= The Navigation Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2 c. 18), long-titled An Act for the Encourageing and increasing of Shipping and Navigation, was passed on 13 September by the Convention Parliament and confirmed by the Cavalier Parliament on 27 July 1661.The Second Navigation Act 1660, via Archive.org The act broadened and strengthened restrictions under Cromwell's earlier act. Colonial imports and exports were now restricted to ships \\"as doe truly and without fraud belong onely to the people of England ... or are of the built of and belonging to\\" any of the English possessions.Navigation Act 1660, text Additionally, ships' crews now had to be 75% English, rather than just a majority, and ship captains were required to post a bond to ensure compliance and could recoup the funds upon arrival. The penalty for non-compliance was the forfeiture of both the ship and its cargo. The act provides that violations of the navigation act were to be tried in \\"any court of record,\\" but it also authorizes and strictly requires all commanders of ships of war to seize non- English ships and deliver them to the Court of Admiralty. The act specified seven colonial products, known as \\"enumerated\\" commodities or items, that were to be shipped from the colonies only to England or another English colonies. These items were tropical or semi-tropical produce that could not be grown in the mother country, but were of higher economic value and used in English competitive manufacturing. The initial products included sugar, tobacco, cotton wool, indigo, ginger, fustic, or other dyeing woods. Previously only tobacco export had been restricted to England. Additional enumerated items would be included in subsequent navigation acts, for example the cocoa bean was added in 1672, after drinking chocolate became the fashion. In a significant bow to English merchants and to the detriment of numerous foreign colonists, section two of the act declared that \\"no alien or person not born within the allegiance of our sovereign lord the King, his heirs and successors, or naturalized or made a free denizen, shall... exercise the trade or occupation of a merchant or factor in any of the said places\\" (i.e. lands, islands, plantations, or territories belonging to the King in Asia, Africa, or America), upon pain of forfeiting all goods and chattels. Passage of the Navigation Act 1660 act was immediately followed by the Customs Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2 c. 19),Charles II, 1660: An Act to prevent Fraudes and Concealments of His Majestyes Customes and Subsidyes. which established how the customs duties would be collected by the government, as well as for subsidies (tunnage and poundage) for royal expenses. These acts of revenue, previously established under the Commonwealth, were similarly reauthorized with the restoration. The 1660 customs act was tightened by the Customs Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2 c. 11). It also emphatically defines \\"Englishmen\\" under the Navigation Acts: \\"Whereas it is required by the [Navigation Act 1660] that in sundry cases the Master and three-fourths of the Mariners are to be English, it is to be understood that any of His Majesty's Subjects of England, Ireland, and His Plantations are to be accounted English and no others.\\"An Act for preventing Frauds and regulating Abuses in His Majesties Customes. Other acts relating to trade were passed in the same session of Parliament and reiterated previous acts. These include the Exportation Act 1660 (12 Cha. II c. 32), which bans the export of wool and wool-processing materials,An Act for prohibiting the Exportation of Wooll Woolfells Fullers Earth or any kinde of Scouring Earth. and the Tobacco Planting and Sowing Act 1660 (12 Cha. II c. 34), which prohibits growing tobacco in England and Ireland.An Act for Prohibiting the Planting Setting or Sowing of Tobaccho in England and Ireland. The former act was intended to encourage domestic woolen manufacturing by increasing the availability of domestic raw materials; the latter act was passed to limit competition with the colonies and protect the plantations' main crop, as well as to protect this regulated royal revenue stream. With the kingdoms of England and Scotland still separate, passage of the English act lead to the passage of a similar navigation act by the Parliament of Scotland.Reeves 1792, p.57 After the Act of Union 1707, Scottish ships, merchants, and mariners enjoyed the same privileges. =Navigation Act 1663= The Navigation Act 1663 (15 Cha. 2 c.7), long-titled An Act for the Encouragement of Trade, also termed the Encouragement of Trade Act 1663 or the Staple Act, was passed on 27 July. This strengthening of the navigation system now required all European goods, bound for America and other colonies, had to be trans-shipped through England first. In England, the goods would be unloaded, inspected, approved, duties paid, and finally, reloaded for the destination. This trade had to be carried in English vessels (\\"bottoms\\") or those of its colonies. Furthermore, imports of the 'enumerated' commodities (such as tobacco and cotton) had to be landed and taxes paid before continuing to other countries. \\"England\\", as used here, includes Wales and Berwick-upon-Tweed, though those places were little involved in colonial trade. The mercantile purpose of the act was to make England the staple for all European products bound for the colonies, and to prevent the colonies from establishing an independent import trade.Andrews, p.19 This mandated change increased shipping times and costs, which in turn, increased the prices paid by the colonists. Due to these increases, some exemptions were allowed; these included salt intended for the New England and Newfoundland fisheries, wine from Madeira and the Azores, and provisions, servants and horses from Scotland and Ireland. The most important new legislation embedded in this Act, as seen from the perspective of the interests behind the East India Company, was the repeal of legislation which prohibited export of coin and bullion from England overseas.Charles II, 1663: An Act for the Encouragement of Trade This export was the real issue behind the Act, as silver was the main export article by the East India Company into India, exchanging the silver into cheap Indian gold. This change had major implications for the East India Company, for England and for India. The majority of silver in England was exported to India, creating enormous profits for the individual participants, but robbing the Crown of England of necessary silver and taxation. Much of the silver exported was procured by English piracy directed against Spanish and Portuguese merchant ships bringing silver from their colonies in the Americas to Europe. It was later revealed that the Act passed Parliament due to enormous bribes paid by the East Indian Company to various influential members of Parliament.https://archive.org/details/AlexanderDelMar An act tightening colonial trade legislation, and sometimes referred to as the Navigation Act 1670, is the Tobacco Planting and Plantation Trade Act 1670 (22 & 23 Cha. II c. 26).An Act to prevent the planting of Tobacco in England, and for regulateing the Plantation Trade. This act imposes forfeiture penalties of the ship and cargo if enumerated commodities are shipped without a bond or customs certificate, or if shipped to countries other than England, or if ships unload sugar or enumerated products in any port except in England. The act requires the governors of American plantations to report annually to customs in London a list of all ships loading any commodities there, as well as a list of all bonds taken. The act states that prosecutions for a breach of the navigation acts should be tried in the court of the high admiral of England, in any of the vice-admiralty courts, or in any court of record in England, but while the act again hints at the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, it does not explicitly provide for them. In a move against Ireland, the act additionally repealed the ability of Ireland (in the 1660 act) to obtain the necessary bond for products shipped to overseas colonies.Beer (1893), p.129Osgood 1907, p.208ff The specifically anti-Dutch aspects of the early acts were in full force for a relatively short time. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War the English had to abandon the Baltic trade and allowed foreign ships to enter the coasting and plantation trade.Reeves 1792, p.276 Following the war, which ended disastrously for England, the Dutch obtained the right to ship commodities produced in their German hinterland to England as if these were Dutch goods. Even more importantly, as England accepted the concept of neutrality, it conceded the principle of \\"free ships make free goods\\" which provided freedom from molestation by the Royal Navy of Dutch shipping on the high seas during wars in which the Dutch Republic was neutral. This more or less gave the Dutch freedom to conduct their \\"smuggling\\" unhindered as long as they were not caught red-handed in territorial waters controlled by England. These provisions were reconfirmed in the Treaty of Westminster (1674) after the Third Anglo-Dutch War.Israel (1997), pp. 316‚Äì317 =Navigation Act 1673= The so-called Navigation Act 1673 (25 Cha. 2 c.7), long-titled An Act for the incouragement of the Greeneland and Eastland Trades, and for the better secureing the Plantation Trade became enforceable at various dates in that year; the act is short titled the Trade Act 1672. The act was intended to increase English capability and production in the northern whale fishery (more accurately in Spitsbergen), as well as in the eastern Baltic and North Sea trade, where the Dutch and Hansa dominated commerce and trade. The act also closed a significant loophole in the enumerated goods trade as a result of the active inter-colonial trade. To promote whaling and production of its oil and whalebone etc., the act relaxed the 1660 act's restrictions on foreigners, allowing up to half the crew, if on English ships, and dropped all duties on these products for the next ten years. It also allowed foreign residents and foreigners to participate in this trade if imported to England in English ships. Colonial ships and crews engaged in this trade had to pay a low duty, with foreign ships paying a high duty. To promote the eastern trade then monopolized by the chartered and poorly performing Eastland Company, the act opened their trade with Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to foreigners and English alike. It also allowed any Englishman to be admitted into the Eastland Company on paying a minor fee. The act was a mortal blow to Eastland's royal charter.Anderson 1787, p.521-522 To better secure their own plantation trade from considerable illegal indirect trade in enumerated products to Europe, by way of legal inter-colonial trade, the act instituted that customs duties and charges should be paid on departure from the colonies, if traveling without first obtaining the bond required to carry the goods to England. The purpose of the act was to stop the carrying of plantation goods to another plantation with their subsequent shipment to a foreign country on the grounds that the 1660 act's requirements had been fulfilled. This change was a considerable advance toward the systematic execution of the previous acts, and increased much needed royal revenue given the recent Stop of the Exchequer. To better collect the customs revenue the act established that these were now to be levied and collected by the Commissioners of Customs in England. Also, if a ship arrived with insufficient funds to pay the duties, customs official could accept an equivalent proportion of the goods as payment instead. =Navigation Act 1696= The so-called Navigation Act 1696 (7 & 8 Will. 3 c. 22), long- titled An Act for preventing Frauds and regulating Abuses in the Plantation Trade, became effective over in the next few years, due to its far reaching provisions; the act is short-titled the Plantation Trade Act 1695. It contains new restrictions on colonial trade, and several different administrative provisions to strengthen enforcement and consolidate the earlier acts..Reeves 1792, p.81-91 In tightening the wording of the 1660 act, and after noting the daily \\"great abuses [being] committed ... by the artifice and cunning of ill disposed persons\\", this act now required that no goods or merchandise could be imported, exported, or carried between English possessions in Africa, Asia and America, or shipped to England, Wales, or Berwick upon Tweed, except in \\"what is or shall bee of the Built of England or of the Built of Ireland or the said Colonies or Plantations and wholly owned by the People thereof ... and navigated with the Masters and Three Fourths of the Mariners of the said Places onely\\". To enforce this change, the act required the registration of all ships and owners, including an oath that they have no foreign owners, before the ship would be considered English-built. Exceptions were introduced for foreign-built ships taken as prize, or those employed by the navy for importing naval stores from the plantations. The deadline for the registration of ships was extended by the Registering of Ships Act 1697 (9 Will 3 c. 42)An Act for enlarging the Time for Registering of Ships pursuant to the Act for preventing Frauds and regulating Abuses in the Plantation Trade. A collection of the public general statutes passed in the ... year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, p.385 (1867) In a significant tightening of the navigation enforcement system, section 6 of the act establishes that violations are to be tried in any of His Majesties Courts att Westminster or [in the Kingdome of Ireland or in the Court of Admiralty held in His Majesties Plantations respectively where such Offence shall bee committed att the Pleasure of the Officer or Informer or in any other Plantation belonging to any Subject of England]...Brackets annexed to the original act in a separate schedule. Revenue generated was to be split in thirds between the King, the Governor, and the one who informed and sued. Previously, most of the customs collection and enforcement in the colonies was performed by the governor or his appointees, commonly known as the \\"naval officer,\\" but evasion, corruption and indifference were common. The 1696 act now required all current governors and officers to take an oath that all and every clause contained in the act be \\"punctually and bona fide observed according to the true intent and meaning\\". Governors nominated in the future were required to take this oath before assuming office. To tighten compliance among colonial customs officials, the act required that all current and future officers give a security bond to the Commissioners of the Customs in England to undertake the \\"true and faithfull performance of their duty\\". Additionally, the act gave colonial customs officers the same power and authority as of customs officers in England; these included the ability to board and search ships and warehouses, load and unload cargoes, and seize those imported or exported goods prohibited or those for which duties should have been paid under the acts. Commissioners of the treasury and of the customs in England would now appoint the colonial customs officials. Due to colonial \\"doubts or misconstructions\\" concerning the bond required under the 1660 act, the 1696 act now mandated that no enumerated goods could be loaded or shipped until the required bond was obtained.Hugh Edward Egerton, A short history of British colonial policy (1897), p.114 The act was followed by a special instruction about the oaths and proprietary governors who weren't directly under royal control to post a bond to comply; this was considered by the Board of Trade and issued on 26 May 1697.Reeves 1792, p.90 Since the colonies previously had passed much of their own legislation and appointments, the act included several sections to tighten English control over the colonies generally. The act mandated that all colonial positions of trust in the courts or related to the treasury must be native born subjects of England, Ireland or the colonies. It also enacted that all laws, bylaws, usages or customs in current or future use in the plantations, which are found to be repugnant to the navigation acts in any way, are to be declared illegal, null and void. The act additionally declared that all persons or their heirs claiming any right or property \\"in any Islands or Tracts of Land upon the Continent of America by Charter or Letters Patent shall not in the future alienate, sell or dispose of any of the Islands, Tracts of Land, or Proprieties other than to the Natural Born Subjects of England, Ireland, Dominion of Wales or Town of Berwick upon Tweed without the License and Consent of His Majesty\\". Colonial-born subjects were not mentioned. Such a sale must be signified by a prior Order in Council. With this act the government did start to institute admiralty courts and staff them in more and new places; this established \\"a more general obedience to the Acts of Trade and Navigation.\\" John Reeves, who wrote the handbook for the Board of Trade,Dudley Odell McGovney, The Navigation Acts as Applied to European Trade, The American Historical Review Vol. 9, No. 4 (Jul., 1904), pp. 725-734 considered the 1696 act to be the last major navigation act, with relatively minor subsequent acts. The system established by this act, and upon previous acts, was where the Navigation Acts still stood in 1792,Reeves 1792, p.89‚Äì91 though there would be major policy changes followed by their reversals in the intervening years. Navigation Acts 1696‚Äì1760=Molasses Act 1733= The 1733 Molasses Act levied heavy duties on the trade of sugar from the French West Indies to the American colonies, forcing the colonists to buy the more expensive sugar from the British West Indies instead. The law was widely flouted, but efforts by the British to prevent smuggling created hostility and contributed to the American Revolution. The Molasses Act was the first of the Sugar Acts. The Act was set to expire in 1763, but in 1764 it was renewed as the Sugar Act, which caused further unrest among the colonists. Repeal The Navigation Acts were repealed in 1849 under the influence of a free trade philosophy. The Navigation Acts were passed under the economic theory of mercantilism, under which wealth was to be increased by restricting colonial trade to the mother country rather than through free trade. By 1849 \\"a central part of British import strategy was to reduce the cost of food through cheap foreign imports and in this way to reduce the cost of maintaining labour power\\" (van Houten). Repealing the Navigation Acts along with the Corn Laws eventually served this purpose (towards the end of the century). Effects on Britain The Acts caused Britain's (before 1707, England's) shipping industry to develop in isolation. However, it had the advantage to British shippers of severely limiting the ability of Dutch ships to participate in the carrying trade to Britain. By reserving British colonial trade to British shipping, the Acts may have significantly assisted in the growth of London as a major entry port for American colonial wares at the expense of Dutch cities. The maintenance of a certain level of merchant shipping and of trade generally also facilitated a rapid increase in the size and quality of the Royal Navy, which eventually (after the Anglo-Dutch Alliance of 1689 limited the Dutch navy to three-fifths of the size of the English one) led to Britain becoming a global superpower, which it remained until the mid-20th century. That naval might, however, never limited Dutch trading power ‚Äî because the Dutch enjoyed enough leverage over overseas markets and shipping resources (combined with a financial power that was only overtaken by Britain during the 18th century) to enable them to put enough pressure on Britain to prevent them from sustaining naval campaigns long enough to wrest maritime concessions from the Dutch.Israel (1997), pp. 317‚Äì318 Effects on American colonies The Navigation Acts, while enriching Britain, caused resentment in the colonies and contributed to the American Revolution. The Navigation Acts required all of a colony's imports to be either bought from Britain or resold by British merchants in Britain, regardless of the price obtainable elsewhere. Historian Robert Thomas (1965) argues that the impact of the Acts on the economies of the Thirteen Colonies was minimal; the cost was about ¬£4 per ¬£1,000 of income per year. The average personal income was about ¬£100 per year. However, Ransom (1968) says that although the net burden imposed by the Acts was small in size, their overall impact on the shape and growth rate of the economy was significant since the Acts differentially affected different groups, helping some and hurting others. Walton concludes that the political friction caused by the Acts was more serious than the negative economic impact, especially since the merchants most affected were politically the most active. The Navigation Acts were also partially responsible for an increase in piracy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: merchants and colonial officials would buy goods captured by pirates below market value, and colonial Governors such as New York's Fletcher would commission privateers who openly admitted they intended to turn pirate. Sawers (1992) points out that the political issue is what would have been the future impact of the Acts after 1776 as the colonial economy matured and was blocked by the Acts from serious competition with British manufacturers. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 89 percent of economists and historians would generally agree that the \\"costs imposed on [American] colonists by the trade restrictions of the Navigation Acts were small.\\" Effect on Ireland The acts were resented in Ireland and damaged its economy, as they permitted the importation of English goods into Ireland tariff-free and simultaneously imposed tariffs on Irish exports travelling in the opposite direction. Other clauses completely prohibited the exportation of certain goods to Britain or even elsewhere, resulting in the collapse of those markets. The Wool Act 1699, for example, forbade any exports of wool from Ireland (and from the American Colonies) so as to maximise the English trade. \\"Free trade or a Speedy Revolution\\" was a slogan of the Irish Volunteers in the late 18th century.

He came of an old family of Choiseul, which arose in the valley of the Upper Marne in the 10th century and divided into many branches, three of the names of which, Hostel, Praslin and du Plessis, were borne, at one time or another, by C√©sar. Entering the army at the age of fourteen as proprietary colonel of an infantry regiment, he shared in almost all the exploits of the French arms during the reign of Louis XIII. He took part in the siege of La Rochelle, survived the defence of the island of Re against the attacks of the English under the Duke of Buckingham, and accompanied the English forces to Italy in 1629. In 1630 he became the French ambassador to the court of Duke Victor Amadeus I of Savoy, and engaged in diplomatic and administrative work in Italy until 1635, when the Franco-Spanish War broke out. In the war that followed, Plessis-Praslin distinguished himself in various battles and sieges in Italy, including the action called the \\"Route de Quiers\\" and the celebrated four-cornered operations round Turin. In 1640 he became governor of Turin, and in 1642 lieutenant-general, and after further service in Italy he became a Marshal of France (1645) and second in command in Catalonia, where he took Roses. During the first war of the Fronde (1648‚Äì1649), he assisted Cond√© in the brief siege of Paris (January 1649); and in the second war of the Fronde (1650‚Äì1653), remaining loyal to the queen regent Anne of Austria and the court party, he won his greatest triumph in defeating Turenne and the allied Spaniards and rebels at Retbel (or Blanc-Champ) in 1650. He then held high office at the court of Louis XIV, became minister of state in 1652, and in November 1665 was created duc de Choiseul. He was concerned in some of the negotiations between Louis and Charles II of England which led to the treaty of Dover (1670), and died in Paris on 23 December 1675.

The film was written and directed by Jonathan Lynn and produced by HandMade Films. Many of the outdoor scenes were shot in Chiswick, White City and Kings Cross. The soundtrack was composed and performed by Yello and also features George Harrison's song \\"Blow Away\\" in addition to Steve Winwood‚Äôs \\"Roll With It\\". Plot After their boss is killed during a bank heist, London gangsters Brian Hope (Idle) and Charlie McManus (Coltrane) desire to lead more peaceful lives in Brazil, disapproving of their new younger and more brash boss, Casey (Patterson). While planning to rob a local Triad gang of their ill-gotten drug money, Brian meets and falls in love with a waitress, Faith (Coduri). During the robbery, Brian and Charlie betray their fellow gangsters, Abbott and Morley, steal the money and flee, but are forced to abandon their car when it runs out of petrol and seek refuge in a nearby nunnery during the ensuing gunfight. Faith, who had tried to warn Brian beforehand, is shot in the wrist by Abbott, while one of the triads is shot and hospitalised. After this, Casey places a bounty on Brian and Charlie's heads. Disguising themselves as nuns, Brian and Charlie introduce themselves to the Sister Superior, Liz, as Sisters Inviolata and Euphemia, respectively. Faith, having witnessed the gunfight and Brian and Charlie fleeing into the nunnery, follows them and poses as a mature student to get inside. Her gunshot wound is exposed and she is taken to the infirmary. Brian pays her a secret visit and claims he is married in order to end their relationship for her safety. When Faith intends to go to church and confess, Charlie distracts the priest, Father Seamus, while Brian poses as him. Faith admits she still loves Brian, but Brian convinces Faith to keep silent. On her way out, she is abducted by the Triads and interrogated. She directs them to Casey and they set her free, but bumps into a lamppost and hits her head on the road, ending up in the hospital, where one Triad has infiltrated the staff as a janitor. Brian and Charlie acquire tickets to Brazil, despite Brian's desire to take Faith with them. Brian decides to tell Faith the truth, but discovers she has not returned to the nunnery. They go to her apartment and only barely escape from Abbott and Morley, who had been sent to retrieve her by Casey. They sneak back into the nunnery and manage to slip into their spare habits after accidentally waking up an eccentric nun, Sister Mary. In conversation, Brian learns that Faith is in the hospital, with her father and brother who are protecting her from the gang. He visits her, but she is heartbroken, believing that Brian no longer loves her. They attempt to flee for the airport the next morning, but are caught and exposed by Sister Mary. In desperation, they steal a truck and head for the airport pursued by Sisters Liz and Mary, Morley and Abbott, and eventually Casey and the Triads. Brian forces Charlie to go to the hospital, where Brian tells Faith the truth while Charlie stalls the gangsters. They manage to escape the hospital with Faith and Casey is arrested, though one briefcase of money is lost during the chase. Sister Liz and Sister Mary find the lost case of drug money and, ignoring the police's concerns, decide to use it to fund a drug rehabilitation clinic. Sister Liz then leads the nuns in prayer, thanking God for sending them Sisters Euphemia and Inviolata, and asking him to, \\"keep on eye on them, won't you? They need you.\\" Brian, Charlie and Faith reach the airport and check-in, when an airport policeman warns the attendant about Brian and Charlie. They board the flight disguised as attendants and successfully escape the UK for Brazil.

Reception The movie received mixed reviews from critics, and was criticised in the United States for its lack of depth and excessive use of nuns for humour. Robert Patterson's performance as Mr. Casey was also widely panned. Nuns on the Run currently holds a 45% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 20 reviews. Roger Ebert asked, \\"Why do filmmakers so often insist that nuns are funny? I'll bet there are some psychological reasons buried around here somewhere.\\" Ebert and Gene Siskel had also ridiculed Fox's advertising campaign for the film; in retaliation, Fox's president of marketing, Bob Harper, announced that they would be barred from press screenings of future films released by the company, though he backed down later that year under pressure from the Chicago Film Critics Association (of which neither Siskel nor Ebert was a member). Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times noted that as far as drag comedies go, the film \\"has some bawdy class‚Äîbut only because of its casting\\". Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times that \\"Nuns on the Run is a great leveler. It makes everyone in the audience feel a rascally 8 years old, the age at which whoopee cushions (when they work) seem the greatest invention since firecrackers.\\" Owen Gleiberman wrote in one of Entertainment Weekly first issues that the film \\"isn't a madcap-hysterical, end-of-the-empire drag farce; it doesn't hash over what Monty Python did definitively over 20 years ago. It's a cleverly directed caper comedy about two crooks on the lam, and it has its fair share of chuckles.\\" =Box office= The film was successful in the US on limited release, making $658,835 in first screenings at 76 theatres. Nuns on the Run grossed US$10,959,015, according to Box Office Mojo.

The paper wrote further: \\"By dovetailing different types of book, Lynn cleverly avoids the pitfalls of both genres. Because it's ostensibly a sort of how-to book, there are no boring childhood reminiscences. Because it's also a kind of autobiography, his no-nonsense dos and don'ts are springboards for entertaining yarns, rather than academic discourse.\\" Lynn won praise for his direction of the 2010 London stage version of Yes, Prime Minister, which he co-wrote as well. =Producing= Lynn also produced six episodes of the new Yes, Prime Minister television series, was executive producer of He's Such a Girl, Vanity Fair, and was a producer for Trial and Error.

Turkey is a country on the northeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, and is a crossroad of cultures from across Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus and South and Central Asia. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization., pp 396-410. With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of Greek, Armenian, Albanian, Polish, Azeri and Jewish communities, among others. Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Despite this however, western-style pop music lost popularity to arabesque in the late 1970s and 1980s, with even its greatest proponents, Ajda Pekkan and Sezen Aksu, falling in status. It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With the support of Aksu, the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Tarkan and Sertab Erener. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative Turkish rock, electronica, hip-hop, rap and dance music in opposition to the mainstream corporate pop and arabesque genres, which many believe have become too commercial.  Classical music  Ottoman court music has a large and varied system of modes or scales known as makams, and other rules of composition. A number of notation systems were used for transcribing classical music, the most dominant being the Hamparsum notation in use until the gradual introduction of western notation. Turkish classical music is taught in conservatories and social clubs, the most respected of which is Istanbul's √úsk√ºdar Musiki Cemiyeti. A specific sequence of classical Turkish musical forms become a fasƒ±l, a suite an instrumental prelude (pe·π£rev), an instrumental postlude (saz semaisi), and in between, the main section of vocal compositions which begins with and is punctuated by instrumental improvisations taksim. Tanrƒ±korur argues that the perceived differences between the traditional music genres stemmed from the cultural clash between the East and the West that emerged during the Tanz√Æmat Era (1839-1908). A full fasƒ±l concert would include four different instrumental forms and three vocal forms, including a light classical song, ≈üarkƒ±. A strictly classical fasƒ±l remains is the same makam throughout, from the introductory taksim and usually ending in a dance tune or oyun havasƒ±. However shorter ≈üarkƒ± compositions, precursors to modern day songs, are a part of this tradition, many of them extremely old, dating back to the 14th century; many are newer, with late 19th century songwriter Haci Arif Bey being especially popular. ;Composers and Performers Other famous proponents of this genre include Sufi Dede Efendi, Prince Cantemir, Baba Hamparsum, Kemani Tatyos Efendi, Sultan Selim III and Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent. The most popular modern Turkish classical singer is M√ºnir Nurettin Sel√ßuk, who was the first to establish a lead singer position. Other performers include B√ºlent Ersoy, Zeki M√ºren, M√ºzeyyen Senar and Zekai Tunca. = Musical instruments = Traditional instruments in Turkish classical music today include tambur long-necked plucked lute, ney end-blown flute, kemen√ße bowed fiddle, oud plucked short-necked unfretted lute, kanun plucked zither, violin, and in Mevlevi music, k√ºd√ºm drum and a harp. = Ottoman harem music: Belly dance = upright=1.0 Female musical players. Ottoman miniature painting, 18th century. From the makams of the royal courts to the melodies of the royal harems, a type of dance music emerged that was different from the oyun havasƒ± of fasƒ±l music. In the Ottoman Empire, the harem was that part of a house set apart for the women of the family. It was a place in which non-family males were not allowed. Eunuchs guarded the sultan's harems, which were quite large, including several hundred women who were wives and concubines. There, female dancers and musicians entertained the women living in the harem. Belly dance was performed by women for women. This female dancer, known as a rakkase, hardly ever appeared in public. This type of harem music was taken out of the sultan's private living quarters and to the public by male street entertainers and hired dancers of the Ottoman Empire, the male rakkas. These dancers performed publicly for wedding celebrations, feasts, festivals, and in the presence of the sultans. Modern oriental dance in Turkey is derived from this tradition of the Ottoman rakkas. Some mistakenly believe that Turkish oriental dancing is known as √áiftetelli due to the fact that this style of music has been incorporated into oriental dancing by Greeks, illustrated by the fact that the Greek belly dance is sometimes mistakenly called Tsifteteli. However, √áiftetelli is now a form of folk music, with names of songs that describe their local origins, whereas rakkas, as the name suggests, is possibly of a more mideastern origin. Dancers are also known for their adept use of finger cymbals as instruments, also known as zils. = Romani influences = Romani are known throughout Turkey for their musicianship. Their urban music brought echoes of classical Turkish music to the public via the meyhane or taverna. This type of fasƒ±l music (a style, not to be confused with the fasƒ±l form of classical Turkish music) with food and alcoholic beverages is often associated with the underclass of Turkish society, though it also can be found in more respectable establishments in modern times. Roma have also influenced the fasƒ±l itself. Played in music halls, the dance music (oyun havasƒ±) required at the end of each fasƒ±l has been incorporated with Ottoman rakkas or belly dancing motifs. The rhythmic ostinato accompanying the instrumental improvisation (ritimli taksim) for the bellydance parallels that of the classical gazel, a vocal improvisation in free rhythm with rhythmic accompaniment. Popular musical instruments in this kind of fasƒ±l are the clarinet, violin, kanun, and darbuka. Clarinetist Mustafa Kandƒ±ralƒ± is a well-known fasil musician. = Military music = The Janissary bands or Mehter Takƒ±mƒ± is considered to be the oldest type of military marching band in the world. Individual instrumentalists were mentioned in the Orhun inscriptions, which are believed to be the oldest written sources of Turkish history, dating from the 8th century. However, they were not definitively mentioned as bands until the 13th century. The rest of Europe borrowed the notion of military marching bands from Turkey from the 16th century onwards. = Turkish influence on Western classical music = Musical relations between the Turks and the rest of Europe can be traced back many centuries, Famous opera composer Gaetano Donizetti's brother, Giuseppe Donizetti, was invited to become Master of Music to Sultan Mahmud II in 1827. and the first type of musical Orientalism was the Turkish Style. pp.13-14; see also pp.31-2. According to Jonathan Bellman, it was \\"evolved from a sort of battle music played by Turkish military bands outside the walls of Vienna during the siege of that city in 1683.\\" European classical composers in the 18th century were fascinated by Turkish music, particularly the strong role given to the brass and percussion instruments in Janissary bands. Joseph Haydn wrote his Military Symphony to include Turkish instruments, as well as some of his operas. Turkish instruments were included in Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony Number 9, and he composed a \\"Turkish March\\" for his Incidental Music to The Ruins of Athens, Op. 113. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote the \\"Ronda alla turca\\" in his Sonata in A major and also used Turkish themes in his operas, such as the Chorus of Janissaries from his Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (1782). This Turkish influence introduced the cymbals, bass drum, and bells into the symphony orchestra, where they remain. Jazz musician Dave Brubeck wrote his \\"Blue Rondo √° la Turk\\" as a tribute to Mozart and Turkish music. = Western influence on Turkish classical music = While the European military bands of the 18th century introduced the percussion instruments of the Ottoman janissary bands, a reciprocal influence emerged in the 19th century in the form of the Europeanisation of the Ottoman army band. In 1827, Giuseppe Donizetti, the elder brother of the renowned Italian opera composer Gaetano Donizetti, was invited to become Master of Music to Sultan Mahmud II. A successor of Donizetti was the German musician Paul Lange, formerly music lecturer at the American College for Girls and at the German High School, who took over the position of Master of the Sultan's Music after the Young Turkish revolution in 1908 and kept it until his death in 1920. A son of Paul Lange was the Istanbul-born American conductor Hans Lange. The Ottoman composer Leyla Saz (1850‚Äì1936) provides an account of musical training in the Imperial Palace in her memoirs. As daughter of the Palace surgeon, she grew up in the Imperial harem where girls were also given music lessons in both Turkish and Western styles. After the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of a Turkish republic, the transfer of the former Imperial Orchestra or Mƒ±zƒ±ka-ƒ± H√ºmayun from Istanbul to the new capital of the state Ankara, and renaming it as the Orchestra of the Presidency of the Republic, Riyaset-i Cumhur Orkestrasƒ±, signalled a Westernization of Turkish music. The name would later be changed to the Presidential Symphony Orchestra or Cumhurba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ± Senfoni Orkestrasƒ±. Further inroads came with the founding of a new school for the training of Western style music instructors in 1924, renaming the Istanbul Oriental Music School as the Istanbul Conservatory in 1926, and sending talented young musicians abroad for further music education. These students include well-known Turkish composers such as Cemal Re≈üit Rey, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Ahmet Adnan Saygun, Necil Kazƒ±m Akses and Hasan Ferit Alnar, who became known as the Turkish Five. The founding of the Ankara State Conservatory with the aid of the German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith in 1936 showed that Turkey in terms of music wanted to be like the West. However, on the order of the founder of the republic, Atat√ºrk, following his philosophy to take from the West but to remain Turkish in essence, a wide- scale classification and archiving of samples of Turkish folk music from around Anatolia was launched in 1924 and continued until 1953 to collect around 10,000 folk songs. Hungarian composer B√©la Bart√≥k visited Ankara and the south-eastern Turkey in 1936 within the context of these works., p 50 By 1976, Turkish classical music had undergone a renaissance and a state musical conservatory in Istanbul was founded to give classical musicians the same support as folk musicians. Modern day advocates of Western classical music in Turkey include Fazƒ±l Say, ƒ∞dil Biret, Suna Kan and the Pekinel sisters.  Early Years of The Republic  After the Turkish War of Independence ended in 1923, and the borders were drawn, there was a social and political revolution under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. This revolution opted to Westernize the way of living in Turkey. By 1929, all public and commercial communications were made in Latin alphabet, completely taking written Ottoman Turkish language out of circulation. A new constitution was written, one that was modeled after the French. This new constitution was designed to make the new Republic of Turkey into a secular, modern, nation-state. Every aspect of the revolution, from major policy changes to clothing reforms, was made in accordance with the Kemalist Ideology. All affairs were carried out followed by a chain of military command for the purpose of reaching the level of a Western civilization. Both religious and Turkish classical music was impacted by this top to bottom revolution. On November 1, 1934 Atat√ºrk made a speech in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Alaturca music was banned on radios, public places as well as private properties.USTA, Nazlƒ±. \\"The Transformation Of Music In Early Republican Period In Turkey.\\" Researchgate.net, July 2010, . Here is the excerpt from the speech, concerning Turkish music, \\"Folks, we all know how sensitive we, the Turkish, are towards the matters of our cultural legacy‚Ä¶. I am aware what kind of progress that my people want to see within fine arts delivered by the new generation of artists, and musicians. If you ask me, what would be most efficient and quick to tackle first within the fine arts is Turkish Music. The music we are made to listen to these days is far from being a point of pride for Turkish people. We must all know this. We must take our great nation's idioms, stories, experiences and compose them, but only complying to the general rules of music. I wish that the Ministry of Cultural Affairs take this matter seriously, and work alongside the law-makers of our country.\\"TUN√áAY, √áaƒülar. \\"Musical Implementations of Atat√ºrk's Term.\\" 9 Eyl√ºl √úniversitesi, Atat√ºrk ƒ∞lkeleri Ve ƒ∞nkƒ±lap, 2009, pp. 54‚Äì95. Right after this speech, on November 2, 1934, The Department of Publishing and Press banned Alaturca music, knowing what Mustafa Kemal meant when he said \\"‚Ä¶ but only complying to the general rules of music‚Ä¶\\" was that the only acceptable type of music available to the public will be music following the principles of western tonal music. The Turkish composers, who were educated abroad in the beginning of the century and came back to Turkey, were assigned to teach classical Turkish musicians the western way of writing and playing music. The Presidential Symphony Orchestra, established back in 1924 started giving weekly free performances in school specifying in Music Education. New instruments like pianos, trumpets, and saxophones were bought for cultural centers in villages, not just in Istanbul, but in many places like Bursa, √áorum, G√ºm√º≈ühane, and Samsun. Along with the radical ideology change, and the sudden application of these new ideas came an obvious tear in the fabric of the society. People who couldn't listen to Turkish music on Turkish Radio sought out the next best thing, and started listening to the Arabic Radio. There are records of Turkish people calling into Egyptian, Crimean, and Haifan radio stations requesting Turkish songs they were used to listening to, since The Middle East already consumed and re-created a lot of Turkish Music since the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the middle of the millennium.ADIG√úZEL, Adnan. \\"WESTERNIZATION OF TURKISH (CLASSIC) MUSIC FROM OTTOMAN EMPIRE TO TURKISH REPUBLIC AND PROHIBITED YEARS OF TURKISH MUSIC.\\" Eski≈üehir Osmangazi √úniversitesi, Eski≈üehir Osmangazi √úniversitesi, ƒ∞lahiyat Fak√ºltesi, ƒ∞slam Tarihi Ve Sanatlarƒ± B√∂l√ºm√º, 0AD, pp. 4‚Äì10. Turkish people started listening to other nations' version of Turkish songs. This cleared the way for the Arabesque music to become hugely popular in the 70s. Today, there are still prolific and popular Arabesque musicians in Turkey. According to Orhan Gencebay, one of the most highly regarded classical Turkish Musicians alive right now, the ban in the early years of the Republic is exactly why Arabesque Music became a cultural phenomenon.Kar≈üƒ±cƒ±, G√ºlay. \\"M√úZƒ∞K T√úRLERƒ∞NE ƒ∞DEOLOJƒ∞K YAKLA≈ûIM: 1970-1990 YILLARI ARASINDAKƒ∞ TRT SANS√úR√ú.\\" CIU, Jan. 2010, pp. 170‚Äì177.  Folk music  Kemen√ße is a popular folk music instrument on Turkey's Black Sea coast Folk music or T√ºrk√º generally deals with subjects surrounding daily life in less grandiose terms than the love and emotion usually contained in its traditional counterpart, Ottoman court music. Most songs recount stories of real life events and Turkish folklore, or have developed through song contests between troubadour poets., p 36 Corresponding to their origins, folk songs are usually played at weddings, funerals and special festivals. Regional folk music generally accompanies folk dances, which vary significantly across regions. For example, at marriage ceremonies in the Aegean guests will dance the Zeybek, while in other Rumeli regions the upbeat dance music √áiftetelli is usually played, and in the southeastern regions of Turkey the Halay is the customary form of local wedding music and dance. Greeks from Thrace and Cyprus that have adopted √ßiftetelli music sometimes use it synonymously to mean Oriental dance, which indicates a misunderstanding of its roots. √áiftetelli is a folk dance, differing from a solo performance dance of a hired entertainer. The regional mood also affects the subject of the folk songs, e.g. folk songs from the Black Sea are lively in general and express the customs of the region. Songs about betrayal have an air of defiance about them instead of sadness, whereas the further south travelled in Turkey the more the melodies resemble a lament. As this genre is viewed as a music of the people, musicians in socialist movements began to adapt folk music with contemporary sounds and arrangements in the form of protest music. In the 70s and 80s, modern bards following the a≈üƒ±k tradition such as A≈üik Veysel and Mahsuni ≈ûerif moved away from spiritual invocations to socio-politically active lyrics. Other contemporary progenitors took their lead such as Z√ºlf√º Livaneli, known for his mid-80s innovation of combining poet Nazƒ±m Hikmet's radical poems with folk music and rural melodies, and is well regarded by left-wing supporters in politics. In more recent times, saz orchestras, accompanied with many other traditional instruments and a merger with arabesque melodies have kept modern folk songs popular in Turkey. = Folk instruments = Baƒülama Folk instruments range from string groups as baƒülama, bow instruments such as the kemen√ße (a type of stave fiddle), and percussion and wind, including the zurna, ney and davul. Regional variations place importance on different instruments, e.g. the darbuka in Rumeli and the kemen√ße around the Eastern Black Sea region. The folklore of Turkey is extremely diverse. Nevertheless, Turkish folk music is dominantly marked by a single musical instrument called saz or baƒülama, a type of long-necked lute. Traditionally, saz is played solely by traveling musicians known as ozan or religious Alevi troubadours called a≈üƒ±k. The tradition of regional variations in the character of folk music prevails all around Anatolia and Thrace even today. The troubadour or minstrel (singer-poets) known as a≈üƒ±k contributed anonymously to this genre for ages. Due to the cultural crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the baƒülama has influenced various cultures in the Eastern Mediterranean, e.g. the Greek baglamas. In Turkish baƒülamak means 'to tie' as a reference to the tied, movable frets of the instrument. Like many other plucked lutes, it can be played with a plectrum (i.e., pick), with a fingerpicking style, or strummed with the backs of fingernails. The zurna and davul duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at weddings and other local celebrations. = Folk literature = A large body of folk songs are derived from minstrels or bard-poets called ozan in Turkish. They have been developing Turkish folk literature since the beginning of 11th century. The musical instrument used by these bard-poets is the saz or baƒülama. They are often taught by other senior mistrels, learning expert idioms and procedure and methods about the performance of the art. These lessons often take place at minstrel meetings and coffeehouses frequented by them. Those bard-poets who become experts or alaylƒ± then take apprentices for themselves and continue the tradition. A minstrel's creative output usually takes two major forms. One, in musical rhyming contests with other bards, where the quarrel ends with the defeat of the minstrel who cannot find an appropriate quatrain to the rhyme and two, story telling. These folk stories are extracted from real life, fokelore, dreams and legends. One of the most well-known followings are those bards that put the title a≈üƒ±k in front of their names. = Arabesque = Arabic music had been banned in Turkey in 1948, but starting in the 1970s immigration from predominantly southeastern rural areas to big cities and particularly to Istanbul gave rise to a new cultural synthesis. This changed the musical makeup of Istanbul. The old tavernas and music halls of fasƒ±l music were to shut down in place of a new type of music. These new urban residents brought their own taste of music, which due to their locality was largely middle eastern. Musicologists derogatively termed this genre as arabesque due to the high pitched wailing that is synonymous with Arabic singing. Its mainstream popularity rose so much in the 1980s that it even threatened the existence of Turkish pop, with rising stars such as M√ºsl√ºm G√ºrses and ƒ∞brahim Tatlƒ±ses. The genre has underbeat forms that include Ottoman forms of belly-dancing music known as fantazi from singers like G√ºlben Ergen and with performers like Orhan Gencebay who added Anglo-American rock and roll to arabesque music. It is not really accurate to group Arabesk with folk music. It owes little to folk music, and would be more accurately described as form of popular music based on the makam scales found in Ottoman and Turkish classical music. Though Arabesk was accused of having been derived from Arabic music, the scales (makam) used identify it as music, that, though influenced by both Arabic and Western music, is much more Turkish in origin. = Religious music = Mosque music  \\"Mosque music,\\" a term for music associated with mainstream religion in Turkey, includes azan (call-to- prayer), Kur'an-ƒ± Kerim (Koran recitation), Mevlit (Ascension Poem), and ilahi (hymns usually sung in a group, often outside a mosque). On musical grounds, mosque music in large urban areas often resembles classical Turkish music in its learned use of makam and poetry, e.g., a Mevlit sung at Sultan Ahmet mosque in Istanbul. Dervish/Sufi music is rarely associated with a mosque. K√¢ni Karaca was a leading performer of mosque music in recent times.See the audio selection from Mevlit at External links below  Alevi influences: The A≈üƒ±k (Ashik) traditions  It is suggested that about a fifth of the Turkish population are Alevis, whose folk music is performed by a type of travelling bard or ozan called a≈üƒ±k, who travels with the saz or baglama, an iconic image of Turkish folk music. These songs, which hail from the central northeastern area, are about mystical revelations, invocations to Alevi saints and Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, whom they hold in high esteem. In Turkish a≈üƒ±k literally means 'in love'. Whoever follows this tradition has the A≈üƒ±k assignation put before their names, because it is suggested that music becomes an essential facet of their being, for example as in A≈üƒ±k Veysel. Middle Anatolia is home to the bozlak, a type of declamatory, partially improvised music by the bards. Ne≈üet Erta≈ü has so far been the most prominent contemporary voice of Middle Anatolian music, singing songs of a large spectrum, including works of premodern Turkoman a≈üƒ±ks like Karacaoƒülan and Dadaloƒülu and the modern a≈üƒ±ks like his father, the late Muharrem Erta≈ü. Around the city of Sivas, a≈üƒ±k music has a more spiritual bent, afeaturing ritualized song contests, although modern bards have brought it into the political arena.  Sufi influences: The Mevlevi traditions  Followers of the Mevlevi Order or whirling dervishes are a religious sufi sect unique to Turkey but well known outside of its boundaries. Dervishes of the Mevlevi sect simply dance a sema by turning continuously to music that consists of long, complex compositions called ayin. These pieces are both preceded and followed by songs using lyrics by the founder and poet Mevlana Jelaleddin Rumi. The sema dance is very ritualistic and full of symbolism. With the musical instrument known as the ney at the forefront of this music, internationally well-known musicians include Necdet Yasar, Niyazi Sayin, Kudsi Erg√ºner and √ñmer Faruk Tekbilek. = Regional folk styles = Minorities and indigenous peoples have added and enhanced Turkish folk styles, while they have adopted Turkish folk traditions and instruments. Folk songs are identifiable and distinguished by regions.  Aegean and Rumeli regions  Rumelia (or Trakya) refers to the region of Turkey which is part of Southeast Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kƒ±rklareli, Tekirdaƒü, the northern part of √áanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). Folk songs from this region share similarities with Balkan, Albanian and Greek folk musics, especially from the ethnic minorities and natives of Thrace. Cypriot folk music also shares folk tunes with this region, e.g. the √áiftetelli dance. These type of folk songs also share close similarities with Ottoman court music, suggesting that the distinction between court and folk music was not always so clear. However, folk songs from Istanbul may have been closely influenced by its locality, which would include Ottoman rakkas and court music. Cities like ƒ∞zmir share similar motifs, such as the zeybek dance.  Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions  Central Asian Turkic peoples from the Caspian Sea and areas have had a huge influence in the purest forms of Turkish folk music, most notably from the Azeris and Turkmen. Pontic Greeks on the eastern shore of the Black Sea or Karadeniz regions have their own distinct Greek style of folk music, motifs from which were used with great success by Helena Paparizou. The diaspora of Greek speaking Pontic people from that region introduced Pontic music to Greece after 1924 population exchange between Turkey and Greece. The region's dance style uses unique techniques like odd shoulder tremors and knee bends. Folk dances include the gerasari, trygona, kots, omal, serra, kotsari and tik.  Southeastern regions  Southeastern regions carry influences from Turkmen music, Zaza motifs and Armenian music. These usually include epic laments. Kanto (Cantare music) Italian theater and opera has had a profound effect on Turkish culture in the past century. Like the terminology of seamanship, the terminology of music and theater derived from Italian. In the argot of the improvisational theater of Istanbul the stage was called \\"sahano\\", backstage was referred to as \\"koyuntu\\", backdrops depicting countryside were \\"bosko\\", the applause was \\"furi\\" and the songs sung between the acts and plays were called \\"kanto\\". The improvised pieces were stage adaptations of the Karag√∂z (shadow puppet) and Ortaoyunu (traditional form of Turkish theatre performed in the open) traditions, aithough in much more simplifled form. The themes explored in these traditional theater arts as well as their stock characterizations and stereotypes were used as the framework tor the new extemporaneous performances of the tuluat (improvised) theater. As with their Italian counterparts the Turkish troupes employed songs and music before the show and between the acts to pique people's interest and draw in customers. Kanto: songs sung between the acts as solos or duets, based on traditional eastern makam (modes) but performed on western instruments. Kanto: \\"first the introduction, then the lyrics, shake your shoulders to a violin, solo, cock your head and shimmy in oriental dance style, leap around like a partridge, then slowly disappear behind the curtain.\\" Kanto: the irreplaceable unifying feature of ali Turkish tuluat theater. We can divide kanto into two periods. The division, particulariy in terms of musical structure, is very clear between the early kanto and the kanto of the Post-Republic perlod. It is further possible to identify two styles within the early period. Galata and Direklerarasƒ± (both neighbourhoods of Old Istanbul). Kanto first took root in the musical theaters of Galata, a part of town frequented by sailors, rowdies and roustabouts. Ahmed Rasim Bey paints a vivid picture of the Galata theaters in his 1922 memoir entitled Fuh≈ü-i Atik (Prostitution in the Old Days): Direklerarasƒ± was a little off the beaten track and in comparison to Galata was a more refined center of entertainment. Direklerarasƒ± was said to be quite lively at night during the month of Ramadan (Ramazan in Turkish) and certainly once its attractions was its family atmosphere. It was here that the troupes of Kel Hasan and Abdi Efendi and later that of Neshid enjoyed a great popularity. It was under the influence of these masters that kanto experienced its golden years. The troupes orchestra would be made up of such instruments as the trumpet, trombone, violin, trap drum and cymbals. The orchestra would start to play popular songs of the day and marches in front of the theatre about an hour before the show to drum up interest. This intermission or Antrak music ended up with the well-known Izmir March, a sign that the show time was approaching. The play began as the musicians went in and took their places at the side of the stage. The kanto singers of the period were also composers. Set to extraordinarily simple melodies which were the fashion of the day, the lyrics relied heavily of tensions between men and women as well as reflecting topical events. The compositions were in such fundamental makams as Rast, H√ºzzam, Hicaz, H√ºseyni and Nihavent. Kanto songs are remembered both by the names of their interpreters and by their creators, artists such as Peruz, Shamran, Kamelya, Eleni. K√º√ß√ºk and B√ºy√ºk Amelya, Mari Ferha and Virjin. That kanto brought an erotic element to the stage performance was an important aspect and one that should not be overlooked or separated out. Art and cultural life gained new dimensions with the changes brought about by the 1923 formation of the Turkish Republic. It was a period of rapid transformation and its effects were widespread. Turkish women had finally won the freedom to appear on the stage, breaking the monopoly previously held by R√ªm (Istanbul Greek) and Armenian women who performed in musical and non-musical theatre. Institutions like Darulbedayi (Istanbul City Theatre) and Darulelhan (Istanbul Conservatory of Music) had long been turning out trained artists. Western lifestyles and Western-style art put pressure on the traditional Turkish formats and these were swept off to the side. The operetta, the tango, then later the Charleston and the foxtrot overshadowed kanto. Kanto's popoularity began to fade, the city's centers of entertainment shifted, and the theaters of Galata and Direklerarasƒ± were closed down. Turkish female artists were unreceptive to kanto's inherent ribairy and chose to keep their distance from it. Around 1935, there was a revival of interest in the kanto form. Aithough rather far from its fundamental principles, a new type of kanto was once again popular. It is important to point out that kanto had now moved from the stage to the recording studio. While the subjects dealt with in the lyrics were stili the same old quarreis between men and women, mixed in with satirical takes on fashion and current events, the songs were being written with the 78 rpm phonograph in mind. So much so that every record label hired their own kanto composers‚Äîand rather famous ones at that. With Columbia at the fore, record labels commissioned kanto from Kaptanzade Ali Rƒ±za Bey, Refik Fersan, Dramalƒ± Hasan, Sadettin Kaynak, C√ºmb√º≈ü Mehmet and Mildan Niyazi Bey. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by c√ºmb√º≈ü (a fretlees banjo like instrument) the ud (a fretless) lute, and calpara (castenets). Foxtrot, Charleston and rumba rhythms dominated. The tunes were being written and sung more tor listening than tor dancing. Female soloists include Makbule Enver, Mahmure, and Neriman; Be≈üikta≈ülƒ± Kemal Senman was the most sought after male singer for duets. Among the topics explored by the new kantocu (singer or composer of kanto) perhaps the most frequent subjert of satire was the new role of women brought about by the formation of the Republic. Songs like Sarho≈ü Kƒ±zlar (Drunken Girls) or ≈ûof√∂r Kadƒ±nlar (Women Drivers) were sung seemingly in revenge for all the suffering they had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other topical songs include Daktilo (The Typewriter) which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires 7 Society. Songs such as Bereli Kƒ±z (The Girl with the Beret) and Kadƒ±n Asker Olursa (If Women Were Soldiers) were full of mockery and ridicule. The early period kanto were largely nourished by Istanbul culture. It was much the same in the Post-Republican period. The city's large and diverse population provided both the characters and the events that were the mainstay of kanto. Kanto was heavily influenced by musical theatre. Roman (gypsy) music and culture, which was itself the subject of satire, left its mark on kanto form. Another major influence was Rum music. The importance of the Istanbul Rum, who were so fond of entertainment and of singing and playing, must not be underestimated. It is a natural and inevitable result of cultural exchange. As it was, almost all the kanto singers were either Rum or Armenian, artists like Pepron, Karakas, Haim, Samran and Peruz who performed during the period following 1903. Eventually kanto became more of a definition, a generalized genre than a musical term. Any tune that was outside of the day's musical conventions, anything light that appealed to current trends and tastes, was labeled kanto. Any music played with different instruments that was free rhythmic or somehow novel was labeled kanto; it was the product of the middie- class, urban culture of Istanbul. Kanto has been viewed as a forerunner of today's pop culture.  Popular music  Popular music is distinguished from the traditional genres as those styles that entered the Turkish musicality after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, either due to attempts of national modernization from 1924 onwards, the opening of the republic to Western musical influences or modern fusions and innovations from artists themselves. = Mainstream pop = Tarkan in Vienna with fans from Hungary Turkish pop music had its humble beginnings in the late 1950s with Turkish cover versions of a wide range of imported popular styles, including rock and roll, tango, and jazz. As more styles emerged, they were also adopted, such as hip hop, heavy metal and reggae. The self-named \\"superstar\\" of the \\"arrangement\\" (aranjman) era of the 70s was Ajda Pekkan who also debuted, along with Enrico Macias, at Olympia, Paris, while MF√ñ (Mazhar, Fuat, √ñzkan) was the celebrated group of the pop scene with an outstanding dexterity in their use of Turkish prosody and their success of amalgamating Western and Turkish cultural ingredients and perspectives. Also one of the most renowned Turkish pop stars of the last decades is probably Sezen Aksu. She contributed considerably to the unique Turkish pop sound of this period, allowing it gain ground from its humble beginnings in the early 50s and 60s to the popular genre it is today. She was also one of the strongest advocates for Turkey to enter the Eurovision Song Contest. Her one-time vocalist and later prot√©g√© Sertab Erener won the contest in 2003. The biggest male pop stars in Turkey are arguably Tarkan, Mustafa Sandal and Kenan Doƒüulu. Tarkan achieved chart success in Europe and Latin America with his single \\"≈ûƒ±marƒ±k\\", also composed by Sezen Aksu, which has been covered by numerous artists.Such as Holly Valance with the \\"Kiss Kiss\\" song. Mustafa Sandal has also enjoyed chart success in Europe with his 2005 single \\"ƒ∞syankar\\", which peaked at number 4 and went gold. = Turkish hip hop = Turkish hip hop or oriental hip hop is a creation of the Turkish migrant worker community in Germany, which some suggest was a suitable outlet for a young generation disillusioned with Germany's treatment of its migrant class. In 1995, the Turkish-German community produced a major hip hop crew named Cartel which caused controversy in Turkey and Germany for its revolutionary lyrics. Hip hop now enjoys wide popularity among the younger generation in Turkey. Ceza (formerly \\"Nefret\\") and Sagopa Kajmer, Sansar Salvo, Pit10, ≈ûehin≈üah, Hayki, Saian are popular figures of contemporary rap music in Turkey. Another popular Turkish hip-hop group is called \\"Turks with Attitude\\" who have a popular track called \\"My Melody\\". This track samples from the American rapper Rakim's \\"Check Out my Melody\\", using a traditional form of Turkish music called arabesque to blend the two styles and cultures together. = Turkish Trance = The very first Turkish trance music was composed by Murtaza Khojami and was named for Yalnƒ±zlƒ±k D√º≈ü√ºnceler. = Anatolian rock = The Turkish rock scene began in the mid- to late 1960s, when popular United States and United Kingdom bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Turkish fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Anatolian rock, a term which nowadays may be generically ascribed to most of Turkish rock. Barƒ±≈ü Man√ßo, Cem Karaca and Erkin Koray are the best known performers; Moƒüollar and Kurtalan Ekspres are the best known groups of older classical Anatolian rock music. =Islamic anasheed= Islamic anasheed are also very popular among some of the Turkish people. The most popular artist in Turkey is the British Azeri, Sami Yusuf, a concert in Istanbul drew an audience of over 200,000, his biggest concert so far around the world.Sami Yusuf Biography - Awakening Records He is one of the most notable singers of anasheed, and can speak in many different languages, which includes Turkish. To date he has performed at sell out concerts in over 30 countries across the world from Istanbul to Casablanca, United States to Germany. Some albums selling more than a million copies in comparison to western music. In Jan 2009 Sami travelled to Turkey where he was invited by Emine Erdoƒüan, wife of the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, to attend a rally in support of peace in Gaza. Another popular Turkish singer is Feridun √ñzdemir, who mainly sings of God and true faith. His records are most successful in the anasheed genre.Qantari.de - Islamic Pop Music in Turkey =Heavy metal and industrial= Heavy metal and industrial groups from Turkey include Pentagram (known as Mezarkabul outside Turkey) and Almora.:tr:Almora Individual musicians in these genres include Og√ºn Sanlƒ±soy and Hayko Cepkin. =Underground black metal and death metal= Underground black metal and death metal bands known from Turkey are Witchtrap, Ehrimen, Satanized, Godslaying Hellblast, Burial Invocation, Deggial, Decaying Purity. = Pop-rock and rock = As a singular phenomenon amidst popular currents since the mid-70s, B√ºlent Orta√ßgil appeared as an urban songwriter/musician with a distinct musical quality, and became a role model for aspiring young musicians. He was the only Turkish musician for whom a tribute album was compiled that included several prominent performers from a wide gamut of different genres. Other recent rock bands with a more Western sound who have enjoyed mainstream success include maNga, Duman and Mor ve √ñtesi. ≈ûebnem Ferah, √ñzlem Tekin and Teoman are examples of individual rock artists with substantial fan bases. Turkey also boasts numerous large-scale rock festivals and events. Annual rock festivals in Turkey include Barƒ±≈üarock, H2000 Music Festival, Rock'n Coke, and RockIstanbul. = Underground and club music = There are many clubs across Turkey, especially across its Aegean region. The alternative music scene however is derived mostly from Istanbul's thriving underground club scene that sees DJs merging the past with the present, using traditional motifs with new age sounds and electronic music. Mercan Dede is one of Turkey's most successful DJs, mixing trance with historical and mystic Sufi songs. Another worldwide recognized name from the underground music scene of Turkey is Mert Y√ºcel. Y√ºcel was responsible for the first house music album to be released in Turkey.http://webarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/1999/09/16/143726.asp He also had worldwide acclaimed and respected releases on US and UK dance labels.http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumartesi/4750843.asp?gid=66 He is one of the key names defining the underground house sound emerging from Istanbul. = Musical influence of Syrian refugees and other immigrants = The influx of immigrants and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Central Asian, and African countries has affected the Turkish musical landscape, particularly in Istanbul. Bands such as Country for Syria, and Saktat explicitly blend the music of different refugee communities in Istanbul to create a mix of Turkish, Arab, Greek, and Western influences. Busking has played an important role in the development of this style.  Music industry  The Turkish music industry includes a number of fields, ranging from record companies to radio stations and community and state orchestras. Most of the major record companies are based in Istanbul's region of Unkapanƒ± and they are represented by the Turkish Phonographic Industry Society (M√ú-YAP). They are part of the IFPI National group. The first long term punishment for piracy distribution had been handed out in 2006. The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their record labels, a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer. Record companies may also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances. In recent years, the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music and general piracy; many musicians and M√ú-YAP have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music. On 13 June 2006 it was reported that M√ú-YAP and The Orchard, the world's leading distributor and marketer of independent music, had reached an agreement on digital global distribution, representing approximately 80% of the Turkish music market. There is not a substantial singles market in Turkey. It is album orientated, although popular singers such as Yonca Evcimik and Tarkan have released singles with success.See information on his domestic singles \\"Kuzu Kuzu\\" and \\"H√ºp\\". Most music charts not related to album sales, measure popularity by music video feedback and radio airplay. Turkish radio stations often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. With the introduction of commercial radio and television in the early 1990s ending the monopoly of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), a multitude of radio and TV stations were opened by newspaper media moguls. These media chains sponsor award ceremonies such as the Kral TV awards for music, but most accredited music awards are based on sales given out by industry societies such as M√ú-YAP and the Magazine Journalists Society (MJS). Though major record companies dominate the Turkish industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Indie music is mostly based around local record labels with limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen to. Perhaps the most successful Turkish name associated with the indie music outside of Turkey is Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records. His promotion of some of the most famous R&B; and soul artists in North America and his contribution to the American music industry has earned a place in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, together with his brother Nesuhi. Music education Music has a place in education in Turkey, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band or social clubs and communities for Turkish classical or folk music, known as cemiyets. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs Mehter marches at school festivals. However, class time given to music in schools is restricted, and a large proportion of Turkish children and adults seem to have limited musical ability, e.g. they are unable to join a melody singing at the same pitch. Higher education in the field of music in Turkey is mostly based around large universities, connected to state music academies and conservatories. A conservatory is usually a department of a university, not a separate institution. While many students join conservatories at the usual university entrance age, some conservatories also include a 'Lise' (Lycee), in effect a specialist music school for children aged 14 to 18 years. Conservatories often have a musicology department, and do research on many styles of music especially the Turkish traditional genres, while also keeping a database of sounds in their sound libraries.  Holidays and festivals  Children's folklore ensemble from Turkey during a festival. Music is an important part of several Turkish holidays and festivals, especially playing a major part in the springtime celebration of Newroz and religious festivities such as Ramadan. New year is a traditional time for the belly dancer and weddings are celebrated with upbeat tunes, while funerals are mourned with musical laments. Patriotic songs like the national anthem, \\"The Independence March\\", are a major part of public holiday celebrations such as National Independence & International Children's Day celebrations on 23 April and 30 August Victory Day celebrations, a holiday that marks Turkish independence. Music also plays a role at many regional festivals that aren't celebrated nationwide, for example a music and dance parade and festival in Zonguldak. Istanbul, Ankara and ƒ∞zmir are also home to numerous music festivals which showcase styles ranging from the blues and jazz to indie rock and heavy metal. Some music festivals are strictly local in scope, including few or no performers with a national reputation, and are generally operated by local promoters. Recently large soft drink companies have operated their own music festivals, such as Rock'n Coke and Fanta parties, which draw huge crowds.

She had earlier studied art and theater in Paris, and was working in New York as an actress. She later worked at sculpture and pottery. Wood was characterized as the \\"Mama of Dada\\". She partially inspired the character of Rose DeWitt Bukater in James Cameron's 1997 film, Titanic after the director read Wood's autobiography while developing the film. Beatrice Wood died nine days after her 105th birthday in Ojai, California. Childhood Beatrice Wood was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of wealthy socialites. After the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, the family moved to New York. Despite her parents' strong opposition, Wood insisted on pursuing a career in the arts. Eventually her parents agreed to let her study painting. Because she was fluent in French, they sent her to Paris, where she studied acting at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and art at the prestigious Acad√©mie Julian. The onset of World War I forced Wood to return to the United States. She continued acting with a French Repertory Company in New York City, performing more than sixty roles in two years. She worked for several years performing on the stage.Internet Broadway Database: Beatrice Wood Credits on Broadway Dada and the Avant-garde Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Beatrice Wood at the Broadway Photo Shop, New York City, 1917 Wood's involvement in the Avant Garde began with her introduction to Marcel Duchamp. He and his friend Henri-Pierre Roch√©, a man fourteen years her senior, met her in New York in 1916 while she was visiting the composer Edgard Var√®se, who was hospitalized with a broken leg. The three worked together to create The Blind Man, a magazine that was one of the earliest manifestations of the Dada art movement in the United States. The publication was intended to defend the submission of a urinal by Duchamp who had submitted it under the name R. Mutt to the First Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in April 1917. Wood wrote the oft-quoted statement that appeared in the publication as an unsigned editorial: \\"As for plumbing, that is absurd. The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges.\\" Wood also submitted to the exhibition and her piece 'Un peu d'eau dans du savon', which she had made alongside Duchamp in his studio, was accepted and was displayed. The work was the image of a nude female figure rising from her bath, but because Wood attached an actual piece of soap to what she called the \\"tactical position\\", the work drew a great deal of attention and critical reaction. =Roch√©, Duchamp, and Jules et Jim= Though she was most involved with Roch√©, the two often spent time with Duchamp, creating a kind of love triangle. Since the late 20th century, biographies of Wood have associated Roch√©'s 1956 novel Jules et Jim (and the 1962 film adaptation), with the relationship among Duchamp, Wood, and Roch√©. Other sources link their triangle to Roch√©'s unfinished novel, Victor. Beatrice Wood commented on this topic in her 1985 autobiography, I Shock Myself: > Roch√© lived in Paris with his wife Denise, and had by now written Jules et > Jim... Because the story concerns two young men who are close friends and a > woman who loves them both, people have wondered how much was based on Roch√©, > Marcel, and me. I cannot say what memories or episodes inspired Roch√©, but > the characters bear only passing resemblance to those of us in real life! Jules et Jim is properly associated with the triangle among Roch√©, German writer Franz Hessel, and Helen Grund, who married Hessel.Bright Lights Film Journal  Jules and Jim =Arensbergs and their circle= Wood met the art patrons Walter and Louise Arensberg, who became her lifelong friends. From 1915 through 1920, they held regular gatherings at their apartment at 33 West 67th Street in Manhattan in which artists, writers, and poets were invited to gather, where they were given drinks, hors d'oeuvres, and engaged in intellectual discussions. Besides Duchamp, Roch√©, and her, the group included many other artists of the avant-garde: Edgard Varese, Charles Sheeler, Joseph Stella, Man Ray and Francis Picabia. Wood's relationship with these artists and others associated with the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century, earned her the designation as \\"Mama of Dada\\". Drawings Marcel Duchamp encouraged her to draw, inviting her to use his studio as a place in which to work. She later illustrated her autobiography, I Shock Myself. She signed her early drawings \\"Bea\\", her name in French, but after taking up pottery, she signed most of her work as \\"Beato\\", her nickname. In 2014, a series of her drawings were exhibited as part of the permanent collection of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in Santa Barbara, California Sculpture Figures were an important part of the artist's work during the 1930s and 40s. She explored both vessel forms and sculpture throughout her career. As her skills increased, Wood consciously retained a naive, illustrative style to communicate her commentaries on life and love. She called these works her \\"sophisticated primitives\\". This approach makes clear her love of all types of non-Western folk and primitive art.Garth Clark, Gilded Vessel: The Lustrous Art and Life of Beatrice Wood, Guild Publishing, 2001 Ceramics career Luster Chalice by Beatrice Wood, Permanent Collection, Beatrice Wood Center for the Arts & Happy Valley Foundation While on a trip to hear J. Krishnamurti speak in the Netherlands, Wood bought a pair of baroque plates with a luster glaze. She wanted to find a matching teapot to go along with it, but was unsuccessful. Deciding to make the teapot herself, she enrolled in a ceramic class at Hollywood High School. Throughout her long career in ceramics, she never did make the matching teapot. This hobby turned into a passion which lasted another sixty years, and she studied with a number of leading ceramists including Gertrude and Otto Natzler. Ultimately, Wood developed a signature style of glazing, an all-over, in-glaze luster that draws the metallic salts to the surface of the glaze by starving the kiln of oxygen.Gilded Vessel: The Lustrous Art and Life of Beatrice Wood, Garth Clark, Guild Publishing, 2001 Ojai and longevity In 1947, Beatrice Wood felt her career was established enough for her to build a home. She settled in Ojai, California in 1948 to be near the Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti. She became a lifelong member of the Theosophical Society‚ÄîAdyar. These associations greatly influenced her artistic philosophies. She also taught and lived on the same land as the Happy Valley School, now known as Besant Hill School. At the age of 90, Wood became a writer, having been encouraged to write by her friend Anais Nin, a French writer. Her best-known book is her autobiography, I Shock Myself (1985). When asked the secret to her longevity, she responded, \\"I owe it all to art books, chocolates, and young men.\\" Legacy and honors *In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution named Wood an \\"Esteemed American Artist\\". *Wood left her home and studio to the Happy Valley Foundation.

The victorious German commander, Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg, became a national hero and was later interred at the site. Dedicated by Hindenburg on the 10th anniversary of the Battle of Tannenberg in 1924 near Hohenstein (Ostpreu√üen) (now Olsztynek, Poland), the structure, which was financed by donations, was built by the architects Johannes and Walter Kr√ºger of Berlin and completed in 1927. The octagonal layout with eight towers, each 20 metres high, was influenced by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II's Castel del Monte and Stonehenge.Koshar, Rudy. From Monuments to Traces: Artifacts of German Memory, 1870-1990 Volume 24 from Weimar and Now: Cultural Criticism. University of California Press, 2000 , 9780520217683, page 107. When Reichspr√§sident Hindenburg died in 1934, his coffin and that of his wife, who had died in 1921, were placed there despite his wishes to be buried at his family plot in Hanover.Tomb raiders: leaders‚Äô graves have come in for posthumous revenge throughout history New Statesman, 20 March 2015. Adolf Hitler ordered the monument to be redesigned and renamed \\"Reichsehrenmal Tannenberg\\". As the Red Army approached in 1945, German troops removed Hindenburg's remains and partly demolished key structures. In 1949, Polish authorities razed the site, leaving few traces. Concept and design Aerial view 1944, from a Luftwaffe plane. The memorial embraced the Anglo/French concept of the Unknown Soldier. In doing so, the architects anticipated the concept of Totenburgen (Fortresses of the Dead) housing mass graves of soldiers. This ideology was mooted in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. The architects imagined the memorial to be a new volkish \\"community of the dead\\" and incorporated the burial of 20 unknown German soldiers from the Eastern Front into the project concept.The Great War and medieval memory: war, remembrance and medievalism in Britain and Germany, 1914-1940. Stefan Goebel. , - p38 The memorial was built in a prominent place in a shape reminiscent of the castles of the Teutonic Knights. The monument's location on a hilltop was accentuated by massive earthworks and landscaping designed to look as if nature alone had shaped the site. The design influenced other projects undertaken by architects and builders during the era.Places of commemoration: search for identity and landscape design By Joachim Wolschke- Bulmahn. , p 241 Opening and dedication A gathering of thousands came to the dedication of the newly finished memorial on 18 September 1927. The 80-year-old Hindenburg was dressed in the uniform of a Colonel-in-chief of a Masurian regiment to which he'd been appointed by the Emperor (who had since abdicated). His speech was deemed highly nationalistic and in keeping with the times for the Weimar Republic, but was not well received outside Germany since it denied German responsibility for the war. An extract from the speech was later carved into a bronze plaque by the Nazi regime and installed in one of the towers of the memorial. A line of veterans, ten kilometers long and resplendent in Imperial uniforms, paid homage to Hindenburg and the 20 unknown German soldiers from the 1914 battle who were interred at the memorial. Inn The architects had also built an inn nearby in traditional East Prussian style. The numbers of visitors did not meet expectations initially but during the Nazi era the numbers were such that the inn required an extension. The Nazi era In August 1933 the Nazis held a massive demonstration at the memorial to commemorate the anniversary of the battle. The Polish government allowed 1,500 cars to transit through the Polish Corridor. Among those attending were Adolf Hitler, Hermann G√∂ring, Franz von Papen and Erich Koch, East Prussia's Nazi gauleiter. A year later, the monument again came to prominence on the death of Paul von Hindenburg. Hindenburg had requested a simple service and that he be interred next to his wife (who had died in 1921) in Hanover. However, Hitler decided to seize the opportunity for propaganda and instructed Albert Speer to ensure that the day was spectacular. It began with the transportation of the deceased president in the dark of night, on a gun carriage, from Hindenburg's East Prussian home Neudeck. Following a torch-lit route and escorted by infantry and cavalry, the cort√®ge made its way to Hohenstein. Modernisation of the memorial Image of the entrance to the new tomb Following the interment of Hindenburg, the memorial once again became a national shrine. To add to the theatre, the government of the Reich again called upon the architectural firm of Kr√ºger in Berlin and using the Stonehenge parallel again; above the entrance, a giant stone (symbolically from K√∂nigsberg) was placed, with the Field Marshal's name inscribed upon it. This stone was so large that railway bridges had to be strengthened to aid its transportation. Two giant stone soldiers (as if on guard) were placed outside the tomb. A porphyry statue of the victor, by the East Prussian Friedrich Bagdons, dominated the Hall of Honour above the tomb. The concourse grass was replaced with stone and around the memorial landscape were placed (historically inaccurate) interpretations of the Aryan German presence in East Prussia since the stone age. The new crypt Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg Hindenburg was originally buried in the central yard or \\"plaza\\" of the monument on 7 August 1934. On 2 October 1935, the anniversary of Hindenburg's birthday, the President's bronze coffin was relocated to a new, sombre chamber where he was joined by his wife Gertrud, who was moved from the family plot in Hanover. The new crypt, which was completed in the autumn of 1935, was located directly below the south tower. To create an entrance to the crypt, Hindenburg and the 20 unknown German soldiers from the 1914 battle were temporarily disinterred, and the level of the plaza was lowered by , with stone steps surrounding it on all sides.Tannenberg: a Monument of German Pride, Peter K. Gessner, date unknown The unknown soldiers were re-interred in the side chapels.The Gentlemanly Knight versus the Iron Hun, Geoffrey J. Giles, May 2009 Designed by the Kruger brothers and carved by Paul Bronisch, the entrance to Hindenburg's crypt was dominated by two fourteen-foot sculptures of the Eternal Watch, known as the Ewige Wache, which were carved out of more than 120 tons of imported K√∂nigsberg granite. The mausoleum had a dramatic vaulted ceiling. Pomp The re-interment of the Generalfeldmarschall was marked by much pomp and ceremony by the Hitler administration, who declared that the upkeep of the memorial would thenceforth be carried out at government expense. The sarcophagus was draped in the German War Flag for the ceremony, at which Adolf Hitler performed the rededication. The Masuria region, where the memorial was built, was going through an economic resurgence at that time and nationalistic spirit was running high. This, and the ceremony of re-interment, caused one newspaper to claim \\"a glorious return of the Teutonic Order\\". From 1936-1939 a travelling exhibition about Masuria, but centred on the Tannenberg battle and memorial, toured Germany. The Baedecker guide of 1936 described the Tannenberg Memorial \\"Where President Hindenburg rests beside his fallen comrades\\" as \\"a place of national pilgrimage\\". Plans were drawn up to install busts of the commanders and politicians involved in the Polish campaign with tablets inscribed with the F√ºhrer's speeches and a full-length statue of Adolf Hitler, but these never came about. At least one other commemoration was cancelled after the signing of the Anglo-Polish military alliance in 25 August 1939. The last state ceremonies held at the memorial were of two generals killed in the July Plot of 1944. Hindenburg's disinterment and partial demolition of the memorial In January 1945, as Soviet forces advanced into East Prussia, Hitler ordered the lead coffins of Hindenburg and his wife to be disinterred and along with some of the regimental standards in the tomb, removed to safety. They were first moved to a bunker just outside Berlin, then to a salt mine near the village of Bernterode, Thuringia (in north central Germany), along with the remains of both Kaiser Wilhelm I and King Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). The four coffins were hastily marked to indicate their contents using red crayon, and interred behind a masonry wall in a deep recess of the mine complex, underground. The coffins were discovered by U.S. Army Ordnance troops on 27 April 1945, and were moved to the basement of the heavily guarded Marburg Castle in Marburg an der Lahn, Germany. In August 1946, 20 months after being removed from the Tannenberg Memorial, Hindenburg and his wife were finally laid to rest by the American army at St. Elizabeth's, the church of his Teutonic ancestors in Marburg, where they remain today.The Case of the Distinguished Corpses, Will Lang, Life Magazine, 6 March 1950 On 21 January 1945, withdrawing German forces planted demolition charges inside the entrance tower and the tower previously housing von Hindenburg's coffin, causing both towers to collapse. On 22 January Germans demolished more of the construction with a further 30 tonnes of explosives. After the war more destruction was caused by looting of bronze and metal from the structure, and even stones and bricks were taken to help with the rebuilding of Olsztynek. Dismantling 1998 photo of the remains of the Tannenberg Memorial. A sculpted lion, which once topped an pyramid near the monument, is now displayed in Olsztynek In the spring of 1949, the Polish government ordered the dismantling of the remains of the monument ‚Äî although enough remained for scavengers to continue recycling into local projects. Removal of the ruins continued until the 1980s, by which time virtually all traces of the memorial had gone. Today, only a protruding island in an isolated field remains to mark the extensive site. The Court of Honour (which measured slightly larger than a football field) has been reduced to little more than an overgrown pit of scattered debris and rubble. Several significant remnants of the structure can still be seen elsewhere. A perfectly preserved sculpted lion, which once topped an eight-metre pyramid at another war memorial about 300 m beside the monument, is now displayed in the town square in nearby Olsztynek. After the Second World War, much of the fabric of the stone-and-granite memorial was used to build the Soviet war memorial in Olsztyn, the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in Warsaw, and for the new Communist Party headquarters in Warsaw.

The French sociologist √âmile Durkheim defined the term, and argued that the discipline of sociology should be understood as the empirical study of social facts. For Durkheim, social facts \\"consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him.\\" Durkheim's social fact In The Rules of Sociological Method Durkheim laid out a theory of sociology as \\"the science of social facts\\". He considered social facts to \\"consist of representations and actions\\" which meant that \\"they cannot be confused with organic phenomena, nor with physical phenomena, which have no existence save in and through the individual consciousness.\\" Durkheim says that a social fact is a thing that many people do very similarly because the socialized community that they belong to has influenced them to do these things. Durkheim defined the social fact this way: :\\"A social fact is any way of acting, whether fixed or not, capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint; ::or: :which is general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations\\". He viewed it as a concrete idea that affected a person's everyday life. Durkheim's examples of social facts included social institutions such as kinship and marriage, currency, language, religion, political organization, and all societal institutions we must account for in everyday interactions with other members of our societies. Deviating from the norms of such institutions makes the individual unacceptable or misfit in the group. Among the most noted of Durkheim's work was his discovery of the \\"social fact\\" of suicide rates. By carefully examining police suicide statistics in different districts, Durkheim demonstrated that the suicide rate of Catholic communities is lower than that of Protestant communities. He ascribed this to a social (as opposed to individual) cause.Durkheim, E. Suicide. 1897. This was considered groundbreaking and remains influential. Durkheim's discovery of social facts was significant because it promised to make it possible to study the behaviour of entire societies, rather than just of particular individuals. Durkheim points to individual actions as instances or representations of different types of actions in society. Some contemporary, interpretivist, sociologists like Max Atkinson and Jack Douglas refer to Durkheim's studies for two quite different purposes, however: * Durkheim's studies are graphic demonstrations of how careful the social researcher must be to ensure that data gathered for analysis is accurate. Durkheim's reported suicide rates were, it is now clear, largely an artifact of the way particular deaths were classified as \\"suicide\\" or \\"non-suicide\\" by different communities. What he actually discovered was not different suicide rates at all‚Äîbut different ways of thinking about suicide. * His studies are also an entry point into the study of social meaning‚Äîand the way that apparently identical individual acts often cannot be classified empirically. Social acts (even such an apparently private and individual act as suicide), in this modern view, are always seen (and classified) by social actors. Discovering the social facts about such acts, it follows, is generally neither possible nor desirable‚Äîbut discovering the way individuals perceive and classify particular acts is what offers insight. A further complication is introduced by asking about the status of our \\"discovery\\" of these perceptions and classifications. After all, don't such \\"discoveries\\" also reflect socially embedded practices of classification? But if the alleged discoveries of perceptions of social facts aren't therefore dubious, it is hard to see why the original claims about the social facts are. Mauss's total social fact For Marcel Mauss (Durkheim's nephew and sometime collaborator) a total social fact (French fait social total) is \\"an activity that has implications throughout society, in the economic, legal, political, and religious spheres\\".Edgar (1999), 64 Diverse strands of social and psychological life are woven together through what he came to call total social facts. A total social fact informs and organizes seemingly quite distinct practices and institutions.Edgar (2002), 157 Marcel Mauss popularized the term in his book, The Gift: See also * Dominant ideology * Sociological positivism ReferencesSources * Edgar, Andrew.

He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (ExComm) during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Early life Dillon was born on August 21, 1909, in Geneva, Switzerland, the son of American parents, Anne McEldin (n√©e Douglass) and financier Clarence Dillon. Although Dillon grew up as a patrician, his paternal grandfather, Samuel Lapowski, was a poor Jewish emigrant from Poland. After leaving Poland, his grandfather settled in Texas after the American Civil War and married Dillon's Swedish-American grandmother. Dillon's father later changed his family name to Dillon, an Anglicization of \\"Dylion\\", his grandmother's maiden name. Dillon's mother was descended from the Graham family, Lairds of Tamrawer Castle at Kilsyth, Stirling, Scotland. Dillon began his education at Pine Lodge School in Lakehurst, New Jersey, which he attended at the same time as three of the Rockefeller brothers, Nelson, Laurance, and John. He continued at Groton School in Massachusetts, then at Harvard University, A.B. magna cum laude 1931 in American history and literature.\\"Dillon, C(larence) Douglas.

After his World War II service on Guam, on Saipan, and in the Philippines, he left the United States Navy as Lieutenant Commander decorated with the Legion of Merit and Air Medal. In 1946 he became chairman of Dillon, Read; by 1952 he had doubled the firm's investments. =Political career= Dillon had been active in Republican politics since 1934. He worked for John Foster Dulles in Thomas E. Dewey's 1948 presidential campaign. In 1951 he organized the New Jersey effort to secure the 1952 Republican nomination for Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was also a major contributor to Eisenhower's general election campaign in 1952. President Eisenhower appointed him United States Ambassador to France in 1953. Following that appointment he became Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in 1958 before becoming Under Secretary of State the following year. Dillon and Kennedy in August 1961. Dillon had just returned from the conference in Uruguay in which the Alliance for Progress was formalized, and where Dillon did battle with Che Guevara. In 1961, John F. Kennedy, appointed Republican Dillon Treasury Secretary. Dillon remained Treasury Secretary under President Lyndon B. Johnson until 1965. Dillon proposed the fifth round of tariff negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), conducted in Geneva 1960‚Äì1962; it came to be called the \\"Dillon Round\\" and led to substantial tariff reduction. Dillon was important in securing presidential power for reciprocal tariff reductions under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. He also played a role in crafting the Revenue Act of 1962, which established a 7 percent investment credit to spur industrial growth. He supervised revision of depreciation rules to benefit corporate investment. =Philanthropy= A close friend of John D. Rockefeller III, he was chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1972 to 1975. He also served alongside John Rockefeller on the 1973 Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs, and under Nelson Rockefeller in the Rockefeller Commission to investigate CIA activities. He had been president of Harvard Board of Overseers, chairman of the Brookings Institution, and vice chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations. =Metropolitan Museum of Art= With his first wife, Dillon collected Impressionist art.

A statue representing Molly Malone was unveiled on Grafton Street by then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Ben Briscoe, during the 1988 Dublin Millennium celebrations, when 13 June was declared to be Molly Malone Day. In July 2014, the statue was relocated to Suffolk Street, in front of the Tourist Information Office, to make way for Luas track-laying work at the old location. History The song tells the fictional tale of a fishwife who plied her trade on the streets of Dublin and died young, of a fever. In the late 20th century a legend grew up that there was a historical Molly, who lived in the 17th century. She is typically represented as a hawker by day and part-time sex-worker by night.Siobh√°n Marie Kilfeather, Dublin: a cultural history, Oxford University Press US, 2005, p. 6. In contrast she has also been portrayed as one of the few chaste female street-hawkers of her day. There is no evidence that the song is based on a real woman, of the 17th century or any other time. The name \\"Molly\\" originated as a familiar version of the names Mary and Margaret. While many such \\"Molly\\" Malones were born in Dublin over the centuries, no evidence connects any of them to the events in the song. Nevertheless, the Dublin Millennium Commission in 1988 endorsed claims made for a Mary Malone who died on 13 June 1699, and proclaimed 13 June to be \\"Molly Malone Day\\". The song is not recorded earlier than 1876, when it was published in Boston, Massachusetts. Its placement in the section of the book titled \\"Songs from English and German Universities\\" suggests an Irish origin. It was also published by Francis Brothers and Day in London in 1884 as a work written and composed by James Yorkston, of Edinburgh, with music arranged by Edmund Forman. The London edition states that it was reprinted by permission of Kohler and Son of Edinburgh, implying that the first edition was in Scotland, though no copies of it have been found. According to Siobh√°n Marie Kilfeather, the song is from the music hall style of the period, and while one cannot wholly dismiss the possibility that it is \\"based on an older folk song\\", \\"neither melody nor words bear any relationship to the Irish tradition of street ballads.\\" She calls the story of the historical Molly \\"nonsense\\". The song is in a familiar tragicomic mode popular in its period, and probably influenced by earlier songs with a similar theme, such as Percy Montrose's \\"Oh My Darling, Clementine\\", which was written in about 1880. A variant, \\"Cockles and Mussels\\", with some different lyrics, appeared in Students' Songs: Comprising the Newest and Most Popular College Songs As Now Sung at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, ... Union, Etc in 1884. A copy of Apollo's Medley, dating from around 1790, published in Doncaster and rediscovered in 2010, contains a song referring to \\"Sweet Molly Malone\\" on page 78 that ends with the line \\"Och! I'll roar and I'll groan, My sweet Molly Malone, Till I'm bone of your bone, And asleep in your bed.\\" Other than this name and the fact that she lives in Howth, near Dublin, this song bears no resemblance to Molly Malone. The song was later reprinted in the collection The Shamrock: A Collection of Irish Songs (1831) and was published in The Edinburgh Literary Journal that year with the title \\"Molly Malone\\". Some elements of the song appear in several earlier songs. A character named Molly Malone appears in at least two other songs. The song \\"Widow Malone,\\" published as early as 1809, refers to the title character alternately as \\"Molly Malone,\\" \\"Mary Malone\\" and \\"sweet mistress Malone\\". An American song, \\"Meet Me Miss Molly Malone\\", was published as early as 1840. The song \\"Pat Corney's Account of Himself\\", published as early as 1826, begins, \\"Now it's show me that city where the girls are so pretty\\" and ends, \\"Crying oysters, and cockles, and Mussels for sale.\\" During the 19th century, the expression \\"Dublin's fair city\\" was used regularly in reference to Dublin, and the phrase \\"alive, alive O\\" is known to have been shouted by street vendors selling oysters, mussels, fish and eels. Lyrics : In Dublin's fair city, : Where the girls are so pretty, : I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone, : As she wheeled her wheel-barrow, : Through streets broad and narrow, : Crying, \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!\\" : \\"Alive, alive, oh, : Alive, alive, oh,\\" : Crying \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh\\". : She was a fishmonger : But sure 'twas no wonder : For so were her father and mother before : And they each wheel'd their barrow : Through streets broad and narrow : Crying \\"Cockles and mussels alive, alive oh!\\" : (chorus) : She died of a fever, : And no one could save her, : And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone. : But her ghost wheels her barrow, : Through streets broad and narrow, : Crying, \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!\\" : (chorus) √ó2 =\\"Cockles and Mussels\\" in Students' Songs (1884)= : In Dublin City where the girls they are so pretty, : 'Twas there I first met with sweet Molly Malone; : She drove a wheel-barrow, thro' streets broad and narrow, : Crying \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, all alive!\\" :Alive, alive-o! Alive, alive-o! :Crying \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, all alive!\\" :She was a fish- monger and that was the wonder, :Her father and mother were fishmongers too; :They drove wheelbarrows thro' streets broad and narrow, : Crying \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, all alive!\\" :(chorus) :She died of the fever, and nothing could save her, :And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone; :But her ghost drives a barrow thro' streets broad and narrow, : Crying \\"Cockles and mussels, alive, all alive!\\" :(chorus) =\\"Molly Malone\\" in Apollo's Medley (1791)= : By the big Hill of Howth, : That's a bit of an Oath, : That to swear by I'm loth, : To the heart of a stone, : But be poison my drink, : If I sleep snore or wink, : Once forgetting to think, : Of your lying alone, : Och it's how I'm in love, : Like a beautiful dove, : That sits cooing above, : In the boughs of a tree; : It's myself I'll soon smother, : In something or other, : Unless I can bother, : Your heart to love me, : Sweet Molly, Sweet Molly Malone, : Sweet Molly, Sweet Molly Malone : I can see if you smile, : Though I'm off half a mile, : For my eyes all the while, : Keep along with my head, : And my head on must know, : When from Molly I go, : Takes his leave with a bow, : And remains in my stead, : (chorus) : Like a bird I could sing, : In the month of the spring, : But it's now no such thing, : I'm quite bothered and dead, : Och I'll roar and I'll groan, : My sweet Molly Malone, : Till I'm bone of your bone, [a reference to Genesis 2:23] : And asleep in your bed : (chorus) Statue Molly is commemorated in a statue designed by Jeanne Rynhart, erected to celebrate the city's first millennium in 1988. Originally placed at the bottom of Grafton Street in Dublin, this statue is known colloquially as \\"The Tart with the Cart\\" or \\"The Trollop With The Scallop(s)\\". The statue portrays Molly as a busty young woman in 17th-century dress. Her low-cut dress and large breasts were justified on the grounds that as \\"women breastfed publicly in Molly's time, breasts were popped out all over the place.\\" The statue was later removed and kept in storage to make way for the new Luas tracks. In July 2014, it was placed outside the Dublin Tourist Office on Suffolk Street. In popular culture Fair City derives its title from the opening line of the song: \\"In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty...\\" Recordings Artists who have recorded versions of Molly Malone include Heino, U2, Danny Kaye, Pete Seeger, Alfred Deller, The Limeliters, Frank Harte, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Johnny Logan, Ian McCulloch, Paul Harrington, Damien Leith, Burl Ives and The Dubliners. Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney recorded an updated version of the song titled \\"The Daughter of Molly Malone\\" on their album That Travelin' Two-Beat (1965). Crosby also sang the song on the album A Little Bit of Irish recorded in 1966. Operatic baritone Bryn Terfel has recorded a highly operatic version of the tune, sung in a somewhat upbeat fashion. Versions of the song have also been recorded in Russian (as –î—É—à–∞ –º–æ—è, –ú–æ–ª–ª–∏ or \\"Molly, my soul\\"), French, and in Dutch (as \\"kokkels en mossels\\").

The embolus may be a blood clot (thrombus), a fat globule (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia 2007 Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect a part of the body distant from the origin of the embolus. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism. An embolism is usually a pathological event, i.e., accompanying illness or injury. Sometimes it is created intentionally for a therapeutic reason, such as to stop bleeding or to kill a cancerous tumor by stopping its blood supply. Such therapy is called embolization. Classification There are different types of embolism, some of which are listed below. Embolism can be classified based on where it enters the circulation, either in arteries or in veins. Arterial embolism are those that follow and, if not dissolved on the way, lodge in a more distal part of the systemic circulation. Sometimes, multiple classifications apply; for instance a pulmonary embolism is classified as an arterial embolism as well,MedlinePlus > Arterial embolism Sean O. Stitham, MD and David C. Dugdale III, MD. Also reviewed by David Zieve, MD. Reviewed last on: 5/8/2008. Alternative link: in the sense that the clot follows the pulmonary artery carrying deoxygenated blood away from the heart. However, pulmonary embolism is generally classified as a form of venous embolism, because the embolus forms in veins, e.g. deep vein thrombosis. =Arterial= Arterial embolism can cause occlusion in any part of the body. It is a major cause of infarction (tissue death from blockage of the blood supply). An embolus lodging in the brain from either the heart or a carotid artery will most likely be the cause of a stroke due to ischemia. An arterial embolus might originate in the heart (from a thrombus in the left atrium, following atrial fibrillation or be a septic embolus resulting from endocarditis). Emboli of cardiac origin are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Thrombus formation within the atrium occurs mainly in patients with mitral valve disease, and especially in those with mitral valve stenosis (narrowing), with atrial fibrillation (AF). In the absence of AF, pure mitral regurgitation has a low incidence of thromboembolism. The risk of emboli forming in AF depends on other risk factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes, recent heart failure, or previous stroke. Thrombus formation can also take place within the ventricles, and it occurs in approximately 30% of anterior-wall myocardial infarctions, compared with only 5% of inferior ones. Some other risk factors are poor ejection fraction (<35%), size of infarct, and the presence of AF. In the first three months after infarction, left-ventricle aneurysms have a 10% risk of emboli forming. Patients with prosthetic valves also carry a significant increase in risk of thromboembolism. Risk varies, based on the valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical); the position (mitral or aortic); and the presence of other factors such as AF, left-ventricular dysfunction, and previous emboli. Emboli often have more serious consequences when they occur in the so-called \\"end circulation\\": areas of the body that have no redundant blood supply, such as the brain and heart. =Venous= Assuming a normal circulation, an embolus formed in a systemic vein will always impact in the lungs, after passing through the right side of the heart. This will form a pulmonary embolism that will result in a blockage of the main artery of the lung and can be a complication of deep-vein thrombosis. The most common sites of origin of pulmonary emboli are the femoral veins. The deep veins of the calf are the most common sites of actual thrombi. =Paradoxical (venous to arterial)= In paradoxical embolism, also known as crossed embolism, an embolus from the veins crosses to the arterial blood system. This is generally found only with heart problems such as septal defects (holes in the cardiac septum) between the atria or ventricles. The most common such abnormality is patent foramen ovale, occurring in about 25% of the adult population, but here the defect functions as a valve which is normally closed, because pressure is slightly higher in the left side of the heart. Sometimes, for example if a patient coughs just when an embolus is passing, it might cross to the arterial system. =Direction= The direction of the embolus can be one of two types: * Anterograde * Retrograde In anterograde embolism, the movement of emboli is in the direction of blood flow. In retrograde embolism, the emboli move in opposition to the blood flow direction; this is usually significant only in blood vessels with low pressure (veins) or with emboli of high weight. Etymology The word embolism comes from the Greek ·ºêŒºŒ≤ŒøŒªŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ, meaning \\"interposition\\".

It belongs to the municipality of the City of Brussels and is mostly identified by the Belgian postal code : 1020. Prior to 1921 it was a separate municipality. Buildings and key features Monument of the Dynasty in front of the Royal Palace. Royal Castle of Laeken =Royal Castle= The Royal Castle of Laeken, official home of the Belgian Royal Family, is situated here. The castle was built in 1782-1784 by Charles de Wailly. It was partly destroyed by fire in 1890 and rebuilt and extended by Alphonse Balat. French architect Charles Girault gave it its present outline in 1902. It has been the royal residence since the accession to the throne of King Leopold I in 1831. The former King Albert II and Queen Paola live in the Belv√©d√®re in the grounds of this castle, while King Philippe and Queen Mathilde live in the main castle. =Royal Greenhouses= Laken, the Royal Greenhouses of Balat (1874-1890). The royal domain also contains the magnificent Royal Greenhouses of Laeken, a set of dome-shaped constructions, accessible to the public only a few days a year. They were designed by Alphonse Balat, with the cooperation of the young Victor Horta. =Chinese Pavilion and Japanese Tower= A little north of the royal palace stand the contrasting Chinese Pavilion and the Japanese Tower. The Chinese Pavilion was commissioned by King Leopold II. The halls are designed in Louis XIV-style and Louis-XVI-style and decorated with Chinese motifs, chinaware and silverware. The Japanese Tower is a pagoda, inspired by a construction Leopold saw at the Paris Exposition of 1900. King Leopold II asked its architect Alexandre Marcel to build him a similar one in Laeken. =Church of Our Lady= A little south of the royal palace, one can find the neogothic Church of Our Lady, initially built as a mausoleum for queen Louise-Marie, wife of Leopold I, whose children included Leopold II of Belgium and Empress Carlota of Mexico. The architect was Joseph Poelaert, designer of the famed Brussels Palace of Justice. The church contains the royal crypt, where the members of the Belgian Royal Family are buried. In February each year, a memorial mass for deceased members of the royal family is held at the church.

The term \\"need\\" denotes a motivated tendency to seek out information. Introduction The need for closure is the motivation to find an answer to an ambiguous situation. This motivation is enhanced by the perceived benefits of obtaining closure, such as the increased ability to predict the world and a stronger basis for action. This motivation is also enhanced by the perceived costs of lacking closure, such as missing deadlines. According to Kruglanski et al., need for closure exerts its effects via two general tendencies: the urgency tendency (the inclination to attain closure as quickly as possible) and the permanence tendency (the tendency to maintain it for as long as possible). Together, these tendencies may produce the inclinations to seize and then freeze on early judgmental cues, reducing the extent of information processing and hypothesis generation and introducing biases in thinking. The level of the need for cognitive closure is a fairly stable individual characteristic. It can affect what information individuals seek out and how they process it. However, this need can be affected by situational factors like time constraints. For example, in the presence of a high need for closure (induced using time constraints), individuals are more likely to use simple cognitive structures to process information. Need for Closure Scale The need for closure in social psychology is thought to be a fairly stable dispositional characteristic that can, nonetheless, be affected by situational factors. The Need for Closure Scale (NFCS) was developed by Arie Kruglanski, Donna Webster, and Adena Klem in 1993 and is designed to operationalize this construct and is presented as a unidimensional instrument possessing strong discriminant and predictive validity. People who score high on the need for closure scale are more likely to exhibit impression primacy effects to correspondence bias, make stereotypical judgments, assimilate new information to existing, active beliefs, and, in the presence of prior information, resist persuasion. Someone rating low on need for closure will express more ideational fluidity and creative acts. Items on the scale include statements such as \\"I think that having clear rules and order at work is essential to success,\\" and \\"I do not like situations that are uncertain.\\" Items such as \\"Even after I've made up my mind about something, I am always eager to consider a different opinion,\\" and \\"I like to have friends who are unpredictable\\" are reverse scored. Composed of 42 items, the scale has been used in numerous research studies and has been translated into multiple languages. Although Webster and Kruglanski (1994) treated the Need for Closure Scale as unidimensional (i.e., as measuring a single factor), the scale actually contains two orthogonal factors, decisiveness and need for structure. Thus, using a total scale score can overlook effects for each factor and complicate interpretations. In 2007, Roets and Van Hiel tried to resolve this issue by revising the scale so it would measure only one thing. They came up with a set of new decisiveness items that provided a viable alternative for the old Decisiveness subscale of the NFCS, which was poorly related to the other NFCS facet scales and had questionable validity. The new items were developed with explicit reference to decisiveness but formulated in such a way that they relate to the need rather than to the ability to decide. In 2011, Roets and Van Hiel created an abridged and empirically validated NFC scale consisting of only 15 items from the original NFC. NFCS items correlate positively with authoritarianism, intolerance of ambiguity, dogmatism, need for order and structure and negatively with cognitive complexity and impulsivity, among several other cognitive tools and personality traits. High NFC scores consistently correlate with items on the C-Scale (conservatism) as well as other measures of political and social conservatism.Jost, Kruglanski et al 2003, Political Conservatism As Motivated Social Cognition Need to avoid Functionally opposite to the need for closure is the need to avoid closure. Need to avoid closure reflects the desire to suspend judgmental commitment. It also contains the subcategories specific and non-specific need to avoid closure. Avoidance of specific closure reflects the desire to avoid specific answers to one's questions. The non-specific need to avoid closure is much like the need for closure irrespective of whether or not this new knowledge points to a conclusion having positive or negative implications for them. The need to avoid closure may stem from the perceived costs of possessing closure (e.g., envisioned penalties for an erroneous closure or perceived drawbacks of actions implied by closure) and the perceived benefits of lacking closure (e.g., immunity from possible criticism of any given closure). The need to avoid closure is controlled by the desire to avoid negative consequences of achieving closure of a situation or to continue the benefits of not closing but elongating a situation. The need and avoidance of closure are conceptualized as ends of a continuum ranging from strong strivings for closure to strong resistance of closure. This is applied in the NFC Scale. Lack of The lack of closure leaves a situation in ambiguity. People high in need for closure seek to avoid this ambiguity at all costs where people high in need to avoid closure strive to make situations more ambiguous. Some perceived benefits of cognitive closure may relate to predictability, the basis for action, or social status accorded the possessors of knowledge (i.e., \\"experts\\"). Similarly, some perceived costs of lacking closure may relate to the additional time and effort required to attain closure, or the unpleasantness of process whereby closure must be reached. Occasionally, however, lack of closure maybe perceived to offer various advantages such as freedom from a constraining commitment, neutrality in an acrimonious dispute, the maintenance of a romantic mystery and so on. Though lack of closure is generally thought of as being negative, it is clear that closure and lack of closure have positive or negative implications depending on the person and situation surrounding them. Implications A need for cognitive closure may occur while engaged in goal-driven or goal-motivated cognitive functions (e.g., attention control, memory recall, information selection and processing, cognitive inhibition, etc.). Ideally, people should attempt to acquire new knowledge to satisfy questions regarding particular issues (specific cognitive closure) irrespective of whether that knowledge points to a conclusion having positive or negative implications for them (non- specific cognitive closure). But because urgency and permanence are central to the motivational core of this overall process, individuals (or groups) may be compelled, consciously or unconsciously, to obtain information prematurely and irrespective of content. A high need for cognitive closure might then invite bias in: # selecting the most relevant information one should attend to for increasing chances of adaptation # initiating and sustaining cognitive manipulations that are required to achieve particular outcomes # making judgments and assessments of input information # weighing information during the course of decision-making For example, the level of NFCC can influence decision-making strategies used by an individual. In a study by Choi et al. that manipulated NFCC, the authors found that a higher NFCC was associated with a preference for using the faster \\"attribute-based search\\" which involves examining all available alternatives on one attribute and then moving on to the next attribute. Individuals with a lower NFCC, in contrast, used the \\"alternative-based search\\", such that they examine all attributes of one alternative, then move on to the next alternative. Thus, studying NFCC has huge implications for consumer buying behavior. Need for closure has also been found to have a role in race- and gender-based prejudice. Roets describes a conceptual fit between Allport's \\"motivated cognitive style\\" of individuals who exhibit prejudice and Kruglanksi and Webster's concept of high-NFCC individuals, such that both display urgency tendency i.e. the desire for quick, definite answers and permanence tendency i.e., the perseverance of the obtained answer in spite of contradictory information. Thus, NFC provides a strong empirical base for Allport's hypothesized underlying cognitive style of prejudiced individuals. A high need also induces the tendency to form knowledge more quickly, tying into other concepts, such as a tendency to prefer autocracy i.e. \\"hard\\" forms of influence that motivate the targets to comply with the agents' demands quickly via the promise of positive consequences or the threat of negative consequences, rather than \\"soft\\" forms of influence that might use extended argumentation or persuasion. Additionally, and especially in those with strong needs for certainty (as measured on NFC Scale), the impulse to achieve cognitive closure may sometimes produce or evoke a mood instability, and/or truncated perceptions of one's available behavioral choices, should some newly acquired information challenge preconceptions that they had long considered to be certain, permanent and inviolate e.g. certain religious or ethical views and values. Thus it is apparent that the need for cognitive closure may have important implications for both personal and inter-personal thoughts and actions, including some related to educational processes and school learning. In education Formal education environments, such as elementary and secondary schools, present opportunities for learners to acquire new knowledge and skills, and to achieve deep, domain-specific conceptual mastery which, through well-designed pedagogical guidance and academic study, may enhance future career readiness, civic engagement, and general well-being. However, although it is understood that the basic principles of learning assert the importance of attending to students‚Äô prior knowledge, fostering conceptual understanding, and cultivating metacognitive awareness, students must also become engaged and be willing to tolerate and cognitively work through the intellectual ambiguity often associated with exposure to novel information and tasks. Yet for students who have high need for cognitive closure, this phenomenon may inadvertently lead to the inhibition of cognitive functions and processes essential to the learning process, so that they can maintain their prior certainty and/or perceived permanence of personally or socially important ideas, even if those ideas or knowledge are distinctly unrelated to any specific content or information being presented in the classroom. In instances such as these, an individual's desire for cognitive closure in another area may outweigh her/his motivation to expend cognitive resources toward learning new information. As a result, the student may appear uninterested and susceptible to under-achieving e.g. poor grades or not performing to expected levels. Unfortunately, in the absence of understanding and consideration of how need for cognitive closure may influence academic and/or achievement motivation, educators may erroneously conclude that a student does not have a desire to learn or that she/he has a cognitive, psychological, intellectual, or behavioral deficiency that is impeding the learning process. This is not to suggest that need for cognitive closure is a suitable explanation for all learning problems; however, in working with students who appear to be experiencing learning challenges manifested through amotivation or low motivation, it would not be unreasonable to explore need for cognitive closure as a potential factor. Research Individuals scoring high on the NFCS are more likely to attempt to draw closure by relying on incipient cues, and the first-encountered apparent fit. The need for closure is also said to predispose a very narrow or shallow information search, along with a higher tendency to use cognitive heuristics, when seeking solutions. (Van Hiel and Mervielde, 2003) In studies on creativity, individuals with high need-for-closure ratings had low creativity scores. Those low in need-for-closure more frequently produced novel solutions that motivated and inspired others in their groups, and the outcomes of the projects in which they participated were rated as correspondingly more productive. Most research on the need for closure has investigated its relation to social stimuli. However, recent research suggests that it may also predict responses to non-social stimuli. In particular, the need for closure predicts an evaluative bias against deviant non-social stimuli (e.g., the letter \\"A\\" presented in a category of letter \\"B\\"s) \\"Closure\\" has also been used more loosely to refer to the outcome of an experience which, by virtue of its completion, demonstrates a therapeutic value. Legal scholars have linked \\"closure\\" to \\"catharsis\\" and \\"satisfaction\\" and at times the legal system may be enlisted into an individual's desire for the cessation of uncertainty. In the case of the death penalty, for example, victims seeking \\"closure\\" may adopt effective strategies as diverse as retribution, on one hand, and forgiveness on the other.

It is composed of around 270 bones at birth ‚Äì this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together. The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 21. The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull and other associated bones. The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs. The human skeleton performs six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation. The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis exist. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. The human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate childbirth.Thieme Atlas of Anatomy, (2006), p 113 Unlike most primates, human males do not have penile bones.Patterns of Sexual Behavior Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach, published by Harper & Row, New York in 1951. Skeletal divisions=Axial skeleton= The axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the vertebral column (32‚Äì34 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts, sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length), a part of the rib cage (12 pairs of ribs and the sternum), and the skull (22 bones and 7 associated bones). The upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton, which transmits the weight from the head, the trunk, and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints. The bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments. The erector spinae muscles are also supporting and are useful for balance. =Appendicular skeleton= The appendicular skeleton (126 bones) is formed by the pectoral girdles, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle or pelvis, and the lower limbs. Their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major organs of digestion, excretion and reproduction. Functions A human skeleton on exhibit at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma The skeleton serves six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals and endocrine regulation. =Support= The skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape. The pelvis, associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures. Without the rib cages, costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would collapse. =Movement= The joints between bones allow movement, some allowing a wider range of movement than others, e.g. the ball and socket joint allows a greater range of movement than the pivot joint at the neck. Movement is powered by skeletal muscles, which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones. Muscles, bones, and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement, all coordinated by the nervous system. It is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement. Shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly. =Protection= The skeleton helps to protect our many vital internal organs from being damaged. * The skull protects the brain * The vertebrae protect the spinal cord. * The rib cage, spine, and sternum protect the lungs, heart and major blood vessels. =Blood cell production= The skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis, the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow. In children, haematopoiesis occurs primarily in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia. In adults, it occurs mainly in the pelvis, cranium, vertebrae, and sternum. =Storage= The bone matrix can store calcium and is involved in calcium metabolism, and bone marrow can store iron in ferritin and is involved in iron metabolism. However, bones are not entirely made of calcium, but a mixture of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyapatite, the latter making up 70% of a bone. Hydroxyapatite is in turn composed of 39.8% of calcium, 41.4% of oxygen, 18.5% of phosphorus, and 0.2% of hydrogen by mass. Chondroitin sulfate is a sugar made up primarily of oxygen and carbon. =Endocrine regulation= Bone cells release a hormone called osteocalcin, which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat. Sex differences During construction of the York to Scarborough Railway Bridge in 1901, workmen discovered a large stone coffin, close to the River Ouse. Inside was a skeleton, accompanied by an array of unusual and expensive objects. This chance find represents one of the most significant discoveries ever made from Roman York. Study of the skeleton has revealed that it belonged to a woman. Anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas, but tend to be limited in the skeleton. The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis are exhibited across human populations. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. It is not known whether or to what extent those differences are genetic or environmental. =Skull= A variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism, such as the median nuchal line, mastoid processes, supraorbital margin, supraorbital ridge, and the chin. =Dentition= Human inter-sex dental dimorphism centers on the canine teeth, but it is not nearly as pronounced as in the other great apes. =Long bones= Long bones are generally larger in males than in females within a given population. Muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females, reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes. Sexual dimorphism in the long bones is commonly characterized by morphometric or gross morphological analyses. =Pelvis= The human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones, specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity, ilia, greater sciatic notches, and the sub-pubic angle. The Phenice method is commonly used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton by anthropologists with 96% to 100% accuracy in some populations. Women's pelvises are wider in the pelvic inlet and are wider throughout the pelvis to allow for child birth. The sacrum in the women's pelvis is curved inwards to allow the child to have a \\"funnel\\" to assist in the child's pathway from the uterus to the birth canal. Clinical significance There are many classified skeletal disorders. One of the most common is osteoporosis. Also common is scoliosis, a side-to-side curve in the back or spine, often creating a pronounced \\"C\\" or \\"S\\" shape when viewed on an x-ray of the spine. This condition is most apparent during adolescence, and is most common with females. =Arthritis= Arthritis is a disorder of the joints. It involves inflammation of one or more joints. When affected by arthritis, the joint or joints affected may be painful to move, may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely. The symptoms of arthritis will vary differently between types of arthritis. The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton. The cartilage in the affected joints will degrade, soften and wear away. This decreases the mobility of the joints and decreases the space between bones where cartilage should be. =Osteoporosis= Osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, increasing the likelihood of fractures. Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex- matched average, as measured by Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, with the term \\"established osteoporosis\\" including the presence of a fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called \\"postmenopausal osteoporosis\\", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids. Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture. Osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet. Calcium supplements may also be advised, as may Vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, Strontium ranelate, and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing Hormone replacement therapy. History Sushruta, a famous medical scholar from India born in 600 BC, wrote the Su≈õruta-sa·πÉhitƒÅ. In its extant form, its 184 chapters contain descriptions of 1,120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources. The text discusses such surgical techniques as making incisions, probing, extraction of foreign bodies, alkali and thermal cauterization, tooth extraction, excisions, and trocars for draining abscess, draining hydrocele and ascitic fluid, removal of the prostate gland, urethral stricture dilatation, vesicolithotomy, hernia surgery, caesarian section, management of haemorrhoids, fistulae, laparotomy and management of intestinal obstruction, perforated intestines and accidental perforation of the abdomen with protrusion of omentum and the principles of fracture management, viz., traction, manipulation, apposition and stabilization including some measures of rehabilitation and fitting of prosthetic. It enumerates six types of dislocations, twelve varieties of fractures, and classification of the bones and their reaction to the injuries, and gives a classification of eye diseases including cataract surgery. The study of bones in ancient Greece started under Ptolemaic kings due to their link to Egypt. Herophilos, through his work by studying dissected human corpses in Alexandria, is credited to be the pioneer of the field. His works are lost but are often cited by notable persons in the field such as Galen and Rufus of Ephesus. Galen himself did little dissection though and relied on the work of others like Marinus of Alexandria, as well as his own observations of gladiator cadavers and animals. According to Katherine Park, in medieval Europe dissection continued to be practiced, contrary to the popular understanding that such practices were taboo and thus completely banned. The practice of holy autopsy, such as in the case of Clare of Montefalco further supports the claim. Alexandria continued as a center of anatomy under Islamic rule, with Ibn Zuhr a notable figure. Chinese understandings are divergent, as the closest corresponding concept in the medicinal system seems to be the meridians, although given that Hua Tuo regularly performed surgery, there may be some distance between medical theory and actual understanding. =The Renaissance= Leonardo Da Vinci, among his many talents, also contributed to the study of the skeleton, albeit unpublished in his time. Many artists, Antonio Pollaiuolo being the first, performed dissections for better understanding of the body, although they concentrated mostly on the muscles. Vesalius, regarded as the founder of modern anatomy, authored the book De humani corporis fabrica, which contained many illustrations of the skeleton and other body parts, correcting some theories dating from Galen, such as the lower jaw being a single bone instead of two. Various other figures like Alessandro Achillini also contributed to the further understanding of the skeleton.

It supports the structures of the face and provides a protective cavity for the brain. The skull is composed of two parts: the cranium and the mandible. In humans, these two parts are the neurocranium and the viscerocranium (facial skeleton) that includes the mandible as its largest bone. The skull forms the anterior-most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisation‚Äîhousing the brain, and several sensory structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. In humans these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton. Functions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision, and fixing the position of the ears to enable sound localisation of the direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, such as horned ungulates (mammals with hooves), the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the frontal bone) for the horns. The English word \\"skull\\" is probably derived from Old Norse \\"skulle\\", while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root Œ∫œÅŒ±ŒΩŒØŒøŒΩ (kranion). The skull is made up of a number of fused flat bones, and contains many foramina, fossae, processes, and several cavities or sinuses. In zoology there are openings in the skull called fenestrae. Structure= Humans = Skull in situ pericranium Human skull from the front Side bones of skull The human skull is the bony structure that forms the head in the human skeleton. It supports the structures of the face and forms a cavity for the brain. Like the skulls of other vertebrates, it protects the brain from injury. The skull consists of three parts, of different embryological origin‚Äîthe neurocranium, the sutures, and the facial skeleton (also called the membraneous viscerocranium). The neurocranium (or braincase) forms the protective cranial cavity that surrounds and houses the brain and brainstem. The upper areas of the cranial bones form the calvaria (skullcap). The membranous viscerocranium includes the mandible. The sutures are fairly rigid joints between bones of the neurocranium. The facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face. Bones Except for the mandible, all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures‚Äîsynarthrodial (immovable) joints formed by bony ossification, with Sharpey's fibres permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as wormian bones or sutural bones. Most commonly these are found in the course of the lambdoid suture. The human skull is generally considered to consist of twenty-two bones‚Äîeight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the occipital bone, two temporal bones, two parietal bones, the sphenoid, ethmoid and frontal bones. The bones of the facial skeleton (14) are the vomer, two inferior nasal conchae, two nasal bones, two maxilla, the mandible, two palatine bones, two zygomatic bones, and two lacrimal bones. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the hyoid bone or the three ossicles of the middle ear but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two. Some of these bones‚Äîthe occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are flat bones. Cavities and foramina CT scan of a human skull in 3D The skull also contains sinuses, air-filled cavities known as paranasal sinuses, and numerous foramina. The sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium. Their known functions are the lessening of the weight of the skull, the aiding of resonance to the voice and the warming and moistening of the air drawn into the nasal cavity. The foramina are openings in the skull. The largest of these is the foramen magnum that allows the passage of the spinal cord as well as nerves and blood vessels. Processes The many processes of the skull include the mastoid process and the zygomatic processes. = Other vertebrates = Fenestrae A Centrosaurus skull Scheme of Spinosaurus skull fenestrae in the skull of the dinosaur Massospondylus {  The fenestrae (from Latin, meaning windows) are openings in the skull. * Antorbital fenestra * Mandibular fenestra * Quadratojugal fenestra * Subsquamosal fenestra, an opening between two parts of the squamosal bone in some rodents * Temporal fenestra } The temporal fenestrae are anatomical features of the skulls of several types of amniotes, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part. Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the synapsids (mammal-like reptiles) and the diapsids (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess one fenestral opening in the skull, situated to the rear of the orbit. =Classification= 258x258px Goat skull. There are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their temporal fenestrae. These are: * Anapsida ‚Äì no openings * Synapsida ‚Äì one low opening (beneath the postorbital and squamosal bones) * Euryapsida ‚Äì one high opening (above the postorbital and squamosal bones); euryapsids actually evolved from a diapsid configuration, losing their lower temporal fenestra. * Diapsida ‚Äì two openings Evolutionarily, they are related as follows: *Amniota **Class Synapsida ***Order Therapsida ****Class Mammalia ‚Äì mammals **(Unranked) Sauropsida ‚Äì reptiles and birds ***Class Reptilia ****Subclass Parareptilia *****Infraclass Anapsida ****Subclass Eureptilia *****Infraclass Diapsida ******Class Aves *****Infraclass Euryapsida  Bones  The jugal is a skull bone found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. In mammals, the jugal is often called the zygomatic bone or malar bone. The prefrontal bone is a bone separating the lacrimal and frontal bones in many tetrapod skulls. Fish Fish head parts, 1889, Fauna of British India, Sir Francis Day Skull of a swordfish The skull of fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. Lampreys and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower jaws being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional dermal bone, forming a more or less coherent skull roof in lungfish and holost fish. The lower jaw defines a chin. The simpler structure is found in jawless fish, in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws. Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large fontanelle. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the rostrum, and capsules to enclose the olfactory organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the inner ear. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single condyle, articulating with the first vertebra. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller foramina for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper. In ray-finned fish, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the premaxilla, with the maxilla itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium. Although the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living lungfishes. The skull roof is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the pterygoids and vomers alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from cartilage, and its overall structure is reduced. =Tetrapods= Skull of Tiktaalik, an extinct genus transitional between lobe-finned fish and early tetrapods The skulls of the earliest tetrapods closely resembled those of their ancestors amongst the lobe-finned fishes. The skull roof is formed of a series of plate-like bones, including the maxilla, frontals, parietals, and lacrimals, among others. It is overlaying the endocranium, corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in sharks and rays. The various separate bones that compose the temporal bone of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the vomer and palatine bones. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the foramen magnum and a median bone lying further forward; these are homologous with the occipital bone and parts of the sphenoid in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian mandible. In living tetrapods, a great many of the original bones have either disappeared or fused into one another in various arrangements. Birds Cuckoo skull Birds have a diapsid skull, as in reptiles, with a prelachrymal fossa (present in some reptiles). The skull has a single occipital condyle. The skull consists of five major bones: the frontal (top of head), parietal (back of head), premaxillary and nasal (top beak), and the mandible (bottom beak). The skull of a normal bird usually weighs about 1% of the bird's total bodyweight. The eye occupies a considerable amount of the skull and is surrounded by a sclerotic eye-ring, a ring of tiny bones. This characteristic is also seen in reptiles. Amphibians Amphibians skulls, Hans Gadow, 1909 Amphibia and Reptiles Living amphibians typically have greatly reduced skulls, with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage. In mammals and birds, in particular, modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain. The fusion between the various bones is especially notable in birds, in which the individual structures may be difficult to identify. Development Skull of a new-born child from the side The skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The skull roof bones, comprising the bones of the facial skeleton and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, are dermal bones formed by intramembranous ossification, though the temporal bones are formed by endochondral ossification. The endocranium, the bones supporting the brain (the occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous. The geometry of the skull base and its fossae, the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae changes rapidly. The anterior cranial fossa changes especially during the first trimester of pregnancy and skull defects can often develop during this time. At birth, the human skull is made up of 44 separate bony elements. During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the frontal bone). The bones of the roof of the skull are initially separated by regions of dense connective tissue called fontanelles. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth, these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the \\"obstetrical hinge\\", which is where the squamous and lateral parts of the occipital bone meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the great cerebral vein. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating sutures. The five sutures are the two squamous sutures, one coronal, one lambdoid, and one sagittal suture. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a \\"soft spot\\" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle. The skull in the neonate is large in proportion to other parts of the body. The facial skeleton is one seventh of the size of the calvaria. (In the adult it is half the size). The base of the skull is short and narrow, though the inner ear is almost adult size. Clinical significance Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses, and changes the growth pattern of the skull. Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it grows more in the parallel direction. Sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain, but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features. In cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain, craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment, sleeping impairment, eating difficulties, or an impairment of mental development. A copper beaten skull is a phenomenon wherein intense intracranial pressure disfigures the internal surface of the skull. The name comes from the fact that the inner skull has the appearance of having been beaten with a ball-peen hammer, such as is often used by coppersmiths. The condition is most common in children. =Injuries and treatment= Injuries to the brain can be life- threatening. Normally the skull protects the brain from damage through its hard unyieldingness; the skull is one of the least deformable structures found in nature with it needing the force of about 1 ton to reduce the diameter of the skull by 1 cm. In some cases, however, of head injury, there can be raised intracranial pressure through mechanisms such as a subdural haematoma. In these cases the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the foramen magnum (\\"coning\\") because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant brain damage or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with concussion must be watched extremely carefully. Dating back to Neolithic times, a skull operation called trepanning was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a burr hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a craniectomy. In March 2013, for the first time in the U.S., researchers replaced a large percentage of a patient's skull with a precision, 3D-printed polymer implant. About 9 months later, the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed plastic insert was performed on a Dutch woman. She had been suffering from hyperostosis, which increased the thickness of her skull and compressed her brain. A study conducted in 2018 by the researchers of Harvard Medical School in Boston, funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggested that instead of travelling via blood, there are \\"tiny channels\\" in the skull through which the immune cells combined with the bone marrow reach the areas of inflammation after an injury to the brain tissues. =Transgender procedures= Surgical alteration of sexually dimorphic skull features may be carried out as a part of facial feminization surgery, a set of reconstructive surgical procedures that can alter male facial features to bring them closer in shape and size to typical female facial features. These procedures can be an important part of the treatment of transgender people for gender dysphoria.World Professional Association for Transgender Health. WPATH Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008).World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People, Version 7. pg. 58 (2011). Society and culture A skull is the symbol of penance, Silk embroidery (17th century) Artificial cranial deformation is a largely historical practice of some cultures. Cords and wooden boards would be used to apply pressure to an infant's skull and alter its shape, sometimes quite significantly. This procedure would begin just after birth and would be carried on for several years. =Osteology= Like the face, the skull and teeth can also indicate a person's life history and origin. Forensic scientists and archaeologists use metric and nonmetric traits to estimate what the bearer of the skull looked like. When a significant amount of bones are found, such as at Spitalfields in the UK and J≈çmon shell mounds in Japan, osteologists can use traits, such as the proportions of length, height and width, to know the relationships of the population of the study with other living or extinct populations. The German physician Franz Joseph Gall in around 1800 formulated the theory of phrenology, which attempted to show that specific features of the skull are associated with certain personality traits or intellectual capabilities of its owner. His theory is now considered to be pseudoscientific. =Sexual dimorphism= In the mid-nineteenth century, anthropologists found it crucial to distinguish between male and female skulls. An anthropologist of the time, James McGrigor Allan, argued that the female brain was similar to that of an animal. This allowed anthropologists to declare that women were in fact more emotional and less rational than men. McGrigor then concluded that women's brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time. To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull. These cranial measurements are the basis of what is known as craniology. These cranial measurements were also used to draw a connection between women and black people. Research has shown that while in early life there is little difference between male and female skulls, in adulthood male skulls tend to be larger and more robust than female skulls, which are lighter and smaller, with a cranial capacity about 10 percent less than that of the male. However, later studies show that women's skulls are slightly thicker and thus men may be more susceptible to head injury than women. However, other studies show this may not be true and may even be the opposite, with men having slightly thicker skulls overall.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260944827_Variability_in_thickness_of_skull_bones_and_sternumhttps://www.iomcworld.org/open- access/computed-tomographic-scanning-measurement-of-skull-bone-thickness-in- patients-with-chronic-tension-type-headache-case-control- study-2155-9562.1000128.pdf Men's skulls have also been shown to be more dense, which may aid in preventing head injury. Male skulls can have more prominent supraorbital ridges, a more prominent glabella, and more prominent temporal lines. Female skulls generally have rounder orbits, and narrower jaws. Male skulls on average have larger, broader palates, squarer orbits, larger mastoid processes, larger sinuses, and larger occipital condyles than those of females. Male mandibles typically have squarer chins and thicker, rougher muscle attachments than female mandibles. =Craniometry= The cephalic index is the ratio of the width of the head, multiplied by 100 and divided by its length (front to back). The index is also used to categorize animals, especially dogs and cats. The width is usually measured just below the parietal eminence, and the length from the glabella to the occipital point. Humans may be: * Dolichocephalic ‚Äî long-headed * Mesaticephalic ‚Äî medium-headed * Brachycephalic ‚Äî short-headed  Terminology  * Chondrocranium, a primitive cartilagionous skeletal structure * Endocranium * Epicranium * Pericranium, a membrane that lines the outer surface of the cranium History Trepanning, a practice in which a hole is created in the skull, has been described as the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence, found in the forms of cave paintings and human remains. At one burial site in France dated to 6500 BCE, 40 out of 120 prehistoric skulls found had trepanation holes.

In other words, the set of positive integers is well-ordered by its \\"natural\\" or \\"magnitude\\" order in which x precedes y if and only if y is either x or the sum of x and some positive integer (other orderings include the ordering 2, 4, 6, ...; and 1, 3, 5, ...). The phrase \\"well-ordering principle\\" is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the \\"well-ordering theorem\\". On other occasions it is understood to be the proposition that the set of integers \\\\\\\\{\\\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\\\ldots \\\\\\\\} contains a well-ordered subset, called the natural numbers, in which every nonempty subset contains a least element. Depending on the framework in which the natural numbers are introduced, this (second order) property of the set of natural numbers is either an axiom or a provable theorem. For example: * In Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic and related systems, and indeed in most (not necessarily formal) mathematical treatments of the well-ordering principle, the principle is derived from the principle of mathematical induction, which is itself taken as basic. * Considering the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers, and assuming that we know already that the real numbers are complete (again, either as an axiom or a theorem about the real number system), i.e., every bounded (from below) set has an infimum, then also every set A of natural numbers has an infimum, say a^*. We can now find an integer n^* such that a^* lies in the half-open interval (n^*-1,n^*], and can then show that we must have a^* = n^*, and n^* in A. * In axiomatic set theory, the natural numbers are defined as the smallest inductive set (i.e., set containing 0 and closed under the successor operation). One can (even without invoking the regularity axiom) show that the set of all natural numbers n such that \\"\\\\\\\\{0,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} is well-ordered\\" is inductive, and must therefore contain all natural numbers; from this property one can conclude that the set of all natural numbers is also well-ordered. In the second sense, this phrase is used when that proposition is relied on for the purpose of justifying proofs that take the following form: to prove that every natural number belongs to a specified set S, assume the contrary, which implies that the set of counterexamples is non- empty and thus contains a smallest counterexample. Then show that for any counterexample there is a still smaller counterexample, producing a contradiction. This mode of argument is the contrapositive of proof by complete induction. It is known light-heartedly as the \\"minimal criminal\\" method and is similar in its nature to Fermat's method of \\"infinite descent\\". Garrett Birkhoff and Saunders Mac Lane wrote in A Survey of Modern Algebra that this property, like the least upper bound axiom for real numbers, is non- algebraic; i.e., it cannot be deduced from the algebraic properties of the integers (which form an ordered integral domain).

A corollary could for instance be a proposition which is incidentally proved while proving another proposition, while it could also be used more casually to refer to something which naturally or incidentally accompanies something else (e.g., violence as a corollary of revolutionary social changes). Overview In mathematics, a corollary is a theorem connected by a short proof to an existing theorem. The use of the term corollary, rather than proposition or theorem, is intrinsically subjective. More formally, proposition B is a corollary of proposition A, if B can be readily deduced from A or is self-evident from its proof. In many cases, a corollary corresponds to a special case of a larger theorem, which makes the theorem easier to use and apply, even though its importance is generally considered to be secondary to that of the theorem. In particular, B is unlikely to be termed a corollary if its mathematical consequences are as significant as those of A. A corollary might have a proof that explains its derivation, even though such a derivation might be considered rather self-evident in some occasions (e.g., the Pythagorean theorem as a corollary of law of cosines). Peirce's theory of deductive reasoning Charles Sanders Peirce held that the most important division of kinds of deductive reasoning is that between corollarial and theorematic. He argued that while all deduction ultimately depends in one way or another on mental experimentation on schemata or diagrams,Peirce, C.

Peirce also held that corollarial deduction matches Aristotle's conception of direct demonstration, which Aristotle regarded as the only thoroughly satisfactory demonstration, while theorematic deduction is: # The kind more prized by mathematicians # Peculiar to mathematics # Involves in its course the introduction of a lemma or at least a definition uncontemplated in the thesis (the proposition that is to be proved), in remarkable cases that definition is of an abstraction that \\"ought to be supported by a proper postulate.\\"Peirce, C.

Early life Lucio Gutierrez, in full Lucio Edwin Guti√©rrez Borbua, (born March 23, 1957, Quito, Ecuador), Ecuadoran army colonel and politician who served as president of Ecuador (2003‚Äì05). Guti√©rrez was raised in Tena, an Amazon basin town. He was the son of a traveling salesman and attended primary and secondary school in Tena before transferring at age 15 to a military college in Quito. Guti√©rrez graduated from the Army Polytechnic School as a civil engineer after having won honor's for academic and athletic prowess. He later studied in Brazil and the United States. Guti√©rrez rose steadily through the army ranks and in 1990‚Äì92 served with the United Nations observer mission to Nicaragua. As a young man, he demonstrated little interest in politics, but during the 1990s he sympathized with fellow Ecuadorans as they became increasingly disenchanted with corruption and poverty. In 1997, as aide-de-camp to Pres. Abdal√° Bucaram Ortiz, he refused an order to use force against a crowd outside the presidential palace. Bucaram fled the palace and was later removed from office by the National Congress. In 1999 Guti√©rrez repeatedly questioned the government's conduct and pointedly refused to shake Pres. Jamil Mahuad Witt's hand during a public ceremony in December. Military career Gutierrez was born on March 23, 1957, in the city of Quito. Although holding degrees in civil engineering, administration and physical education, he chose a career with the Ecuadorian army, where he rose to the rank of colonel before his involvement in a coup against the government. In January 2000, thousands of Ecuadorians of Andean Indian descent massed in the capital of Quito to protest corruption in the government and economic policy. Ordered to break up demonstrations, Gutierrez instead helped feed the protesters, allowed them to occupy the country's congress building, and joined Indian leader Antonio Vargas and a judge, Carlos Solorzano in \\"announcing a government of national salvation.\\" The coup did not last long and the old government returned to power, but with a new president to replace the discredited predecessor. Gutierrez and other supporters of the coup were imprisoned for six months and expelled from the army. As with many other military men who have entered politics in Latin American countries, Guti√©rrez's first experiences in a public forum date back to a period of political and social unrest. Indigenous and poor Ecuadorans staged massive protests when the Jamil Mahuad government decided to adopt the U.S. dollar as the national currency in 2000. Guti√©rrez disobeyed the government's order to repress the protestors and instead, together with fellow officers and their troops, joined the movement to depose president Mahuad. Days later, the Ecuadoran Congress deposed the president and the vice-president took the presidential chair  Political rise  Guti√©rrez entered the national spotlight during the 2000 Ecuadorian coup d'√©tat that unseated President Jamil Mahuad for three hours and forced him to abandon office after demonstrations in Quito by thousands of Indigenous Ecuadorians protested the Mahuad government's support of neoliberal economic policies, particularly the proposed dollarization plans. Instead of ordering to disperse the protesters, then Col. Guti√©rrez and the army stood aside and let them take over the national parliament. Under pressure from the United States, and lacking support from the indigenous movement, the Junta was dissolved by General Carlos Mendoza and the Congress named then Vice President Gustavo Noboa as president of the country. The armed forces jailed Guti√©rrez for six months, but he was discharged, and faced no criminal prosecution despite the fact he was a direct participant. Prior to the 2000 coup, Guti√©rrez was aide- de-camp to former presidents Abdal√° Bucaram and Fabi√°n Alarc√≥n. He claimed that, during the demonstrations that unseated Bucaram in February 1997, he also disobeyed orders to protect Carondelet Palace, leaving Bucaram no other choice but to leave.  Presidency (2003‚Äì2005)  Guti√©rrez ran for President in 2002 as the candidate of the January 21 Patriotic Society Party (PSP), named for the date of the 2000 protest, and the Pachakutik Movement, on a platform of fighting corruption and reversing neoliberal economic reforms. He defeated banana magnate and wealthiest man in Ecuador, √Ålvaro Noboa, in the second round with 55% of the popular vote, through a partnership with the leftist and indigenous movement parties, Democratic People's Movement (Movimiento Popular Democratico/MPD) and Pachacutik, respectively. Guti√©rrez alienated many of his supporters by supporting the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and by keeping the status-quo on economic issues. After three months of government, Guti√©rrez broke his alliance with leftist parties and reached an agreement with the Social Christian Party (Partido Social Cristiano/PSC), continuing the economic policies of its predecessors and increasing bonds with the United States. The government received increased frequent accusations of corruption and nepotism. After two years, Guti√©rrez broke the agreement with the PSC, further weakening the government politically. In November 2004 his former left-wing supporters joined with the conservative PSC in launching an effort to impeach him on various charges. Guti√©rrez was accused of embezzlement by the PSC for using funds, resources and public property in favor of PSP candidates in the elections of 2004, and by the Democratic Left (Ecuador) (Izquierda Democr√°tica/ID), MPD and Pachakutik for jeopardizing the security of the state for literally inciting the people to burn the courts. Impeachment proceedings collapsed when two legislators broke party lines, and a majority (51) votes could not be reached to continue the proceedings. In December 2004, Guti√©rrez alleged that the Supreme Court of Justice was biased in favor of the PSC. His political party, PSP, together with the Institutional Renewal Party of National Action (Partido Renovador Institucional de Acci√≥n Nacional/PRIAN) of √Ålvaro Noboa, the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party (Partido Roldosista Ecuatoriano/PRE) of Abdal√° Bucaram, independents, and MPD, voted in the Congress for the reorganization of the Supreme Court of Justice via majority resolution. His adversaries sustained that the Constitution gives autonomy to the judicial branch and does not authorize Congress to interfere in the judiciary by removing or nominating judges. Judges were replaced by allies to PRE, PRIAN and PSP political parties with the clear intention of dropping criminal charges against former president Abdal√° Bucaram, accused of several acts of corruption during his presidency which led to his exile in Panama from 1997 until April 2005. = Crisis = On April 15, 2005, amid a growing political crisis and protests in the city of Quito against the Government, President Guti√©rrez declared a state of emergency in Quito and revoked the newly appointed Supreme Court of Justice. This was a controversial move that provoked conflicting reactions and was seen by analysts as a dictatorial act. The state of emergency was lifted on April 16, as the State of Emergency was disobeyed by citizens and General Aguas of the army, who refused to enforce it, and Ecuador's Congress was expected to hold a session in order to decide whether to ratify the Supreme Court's dismissal. On April 20, 2005, following a week of massive demonstrations, the Congress of Ecuador (meeting in a special session in a private building, CIESPAL, with opposition delegates only), on the grounds that Guti√©rrez had abandoned his constitutional duties, voted 60-2 (38 members, including the great majority of PRE/PRIAN/PSP deputies, did not vote) to remove Guti√©rrez from office and appointed Vice President Alfedo Palacio Gonz√°lez to serve as President. At the same time, the Ecuadorian Joint Armed Forces Command (Comando Conjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas) publicly expressed that they were withdrawing their support for Guti√©rrez, who had no option but to leave the Presidential Palace on a helicopter. He sought political asylum in the house of the Brazilian Ambassador in the north of Quito, after his attempt to leave the city aboard a plane at Quito International Airport was thwarted by hundreds of angry protesters that breached airport security and blocked the airstrip.  Post-Presidency  Brazil offered Guti√©rrez asylum and arranged air transport out of Ecuador for the former president. He arrived via Rio Branco on April 24, 2005. He renounced his asylum, then went to Peru and the United States. In September he was reported to be seeking political asylum in Colombia. This was offered on October 4 only to be refused by Guti√©rrez on October 13. Then on October 15 he voluntarily returned to Ecuador vowing to \\"use all legal and constitutional means to retake power.\\" He was arrested at the Eloy Alfaro International Airport in Manta, after arriving in a chartered SARPA plane with his brother, Gilmar Guti√©rrez, his companion-in-arms Fausto Cobo, and some collaborators. He was taken to a prison in Quito and locked in a maximum security cell on charges of attempting to subvert Ecuador's internal security by repeatedly proclaiming to the international media that he continued to be the legitimate President of the Republic of Ecuador. On March 3, 2006, a judge in Ecuador dismissed the charges against Guti√©rrez. A very notorious political agreement ensued between Guti√©rrez and the PSC. Guti√©rrez and the deputies of PSP sided with the PSC in order to gain a majority for controlling the country's Constitutional Court. Upon his release, Guti√©rrez thanked the Ecuadorian people for their support and vowed that he would participate and win the presidential election in October. On October 15, 2006, his PSP, led by Gilmar Guti√©rrez, got the third place in the national election with 17% of the total votes, with the support of the economically disadvantaged, landless farmers and indigenous population. In the 2009 Presidential Election, Lucio Guti√©rrez ran for president of Ecuador under the flag of PSP. In the presidential election held on April 26, he came in second with 26.8% of the vote, losing to Rafael Correa. Lucio Guti√©rrez declared election fraud even though all the polls conducted well before election day gave a great advantage to Rafael Correa, and even when international observers from the European Union declared total transparency of the election process.  Post-Election  Almost all supporters of Lucio Guti√©rrez are in the Amazon region where he was born. This relationship has been used by his political party to gain the support of inhabitants of these isolated areas. Guti√©rrez has said he will form a parallel cabinet to that of President Rafael Correa so that if the \\"people give him the opportunity, he will have an experienced cabinet.\\" = Attempted coup = He is alleged to have instigated the 2010 police revolt against Correa. He has fervently denied the allegations claiming that he was in Washington D.C. attending an event at the Inter-American Defense College (of which he is an alumnus), then traveled to Miami to attend a conference on the Socialism of the 21st century and finally to serve as an observer in the Brazilian presidential poll. He has further stated that the whole event was fabricated. A special commission formed by Correa in 2013 to investigate the events has claimed that he and his party plotted, along with the fugitive Isaias brothers (former owners of Filanbanco who reside in Miami after fleeing during the 1998-2000 banking crisis), former chief of intelligence Mario Pazmi√±o (accused by Correa of working with the CIA and of being involved in the Colombian attack against Ecuadorian territory in 2008 which killed FARC leader Ra√∫l Reyes and sparked a regional crisis) as well as others.

Typically the phrase is used to describe the physical abandoning of a child, but it can also include severe cases of neglect and emotional abandonment, such as in the case of a parent who fails to offer financial and emotional support for their child over a long period of time. An abandoned child is referred to as a foundling (as opposed to a runaway or an orphan). Baby dumping refers to parents leaving a child younger than 12 months in a public or private place with the intent of terminating their care for the child. It is also known as rehoming, in cases where adoptive parents use illegal means, such as the internet, to find a new home for their child. In most cases, child abandonment is classified under a subsection of child abuse statutes and is punishable with a felony. Following felonious charges, one or both guardians give up their parental rights over the child thus severing their relationship with the child. Some states allow for a reinstatement of parental rights, in which case the parent or parents can have a relationship with the child again. However, it is unlikely that the parents can ever regain custody. The perpetrator can additionally be charged with reckless abandonment if the victim dies as a result of their actions or neglect. Causes * Poverty and homelessness are often causes of child abandonment. People living in countries with poor social welfare systems (i.e. China, Myanmar, Mexico, and United States) and who are not financially capable of taking care of a child are more likely to abandon their children because of a lack of resources. In some cases the parents already have a child or children, but are unable to take care of another child at that time. * In societies where women are looked down upon for being teenage or single mothers, child abandonment is more common. * Children born out of the confines of marriage may be abandoned in a family's attempt to prevent being shamed by their community. * Physical disability, mental illness, and substance abuse problems that parents are facing can also cause them to abandon their children. * Children who are born with congenital disorders or other health complications may be abandoned if their parents feel unequipped to provide them with the level of care that their condition requires. * In cultures where the sex of the child is of utmost importance, parents are more likely to abandon a baby of the undesired sex. Similarly, people may choose to pursue the often controversial option of sex-selective abortion.Citro, Brian; Gilson, Je ; Kalantry, Sital; Stricker, Kelsey; University of Chicago Law School.

Cornell Law Faculty Publications. Paper 1399. http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1399 * Political conditions, such as war and displacement of a family, are also cause for parents to abandon their children. * Additionally, a parent being incarcerated or deported can result in the involuntary abandonment of a child, even if the parent(s) did not voluntarily relinquish their parental role. * Disownment of a child is a form of abandonment which entails ending contact with, and support for, one's dependent. Disownment tends to occur later in a child's life, generally due to a conflict between the parent(s) and the child, but can also occur when children are still young. Reasons include: divorce of parents, discovering the true paternity of a child, and a child's actions bringing shame to a family; most commonly, breaking the law, teenage pregnancy, major religious or ideological differences, and identifying as LGBT.  Effects on survivors  * Possibility of experiencing abuse and neglect in institutionalized care * Low self-esteem stemming from feelings of guilt about being at fault for being abandoned * Separation anxiety: feelings of anxiety about being separated from parents or caregivers * Attachment issues: difficulty becoming emotionally attached to and trusting other people, especially caregivers * Abandonment issues, characteristic of abandoned child syndrome, including: **social alienation, guilt, anxiety, clinginess, insomnia and nightmares, eating disorders, anger issues, depression, substance abuse, and traumatic reenactment through romantic relationships * Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referred to as posttraumatic stress disorder of abandonment. * Depending upon the severity of their symptoms, children who have developed certain maladjusted tendencies in social interaction may be diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social engagement disorder. * For children who are abandoned in dangerous places, such as dumpsters, doorsteps, and other public areas, exposure to the elements and physical injury are distinct possibilities.  Societal cost  In 2015, it cost the United States' government over $9 billion to support 427,910 children who were in foster care.Child Welfare Information Gateway. ‚ÄúFoster care statistics 2015‚Äù. Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services, Children‚Äôs Bureau.  Child abandonment laws  Child abandonment is illegal in the United States, but some states consider it to be a felony offense, while others categorize it as a misdemeanor, so punishments range from a $2,000 fine to up to five years in prison and a $125,000 penalty.  Prevention  * Providing access to sex education and to family planning resources, like contraception, and abortion can help prevent people who cannot take care of, or do not want to raise, children from becoming pregnant in the first place. * Evidence has shown that, when bans on abortion are lifted, the number of abandoned, abused, and neglected children goes down in response. However, access is an issue. In the United States, 87% of all counties, and 97% of all rural counties, do not have any access to abortion services. * Governmental assistance can be provided in the form of parental counseling, post-natal services, mental health services, and other community support services for parents who are at a higher risk of abandoning their children because of age, support, physical ability, mental illness, or poverty. History Historically, many cultures practiced abandonment of infants, often called \\"infant exposure.\\" Children were left on hillsides, in the wilderness, near churches, and in other public places. If taken up by others, the children might join another family either as slaves or as free family members. Roman societies in particular chose slaves to raise their children rather than family members, who were often indifferent towards their children. Although being found by others would allow children who were abandoned to often survive, exposure is sometimes compared to infanticide‚Äîas described by Tertullian in his Apology: \\"it is certainly the more cruel way to kill... by exposure to cold and hunger and dogs.\\" Despite the comparison, other sources report that infanticide and exposure were viewed as morally different in ancient times. In the Early Middle Ages parents who did not want to raise their children gave them to monasteries along with a small fee, an act known as oblation. In times of social stress monasteries often received large numbers of children. By the high Middle Ages oblation was less common and something that was more often arranged privately between the monastery and the parents of the child. Sometimes medieval hospitals took care of abandoned children at the community's expense, but some refused to do so on the grounds that being willing to accept abandoned children would increase abandonment rates. Medieval laws in Europe governing child abandonment, as for example the Visigothic Code, often prescribed that the person who had taken up the child was entitled to the child's service as a slave.The Visigothic Code: (Forum judicum), Book IV: Concerning Natural Lineage Title IV: Concerning Foundlings Conscripting or enslaving children into armies and labor pools often occurred as a consequence of war or pestilence when many children were left parentless. Abandoned children then became the ward of the state, military organization, or religious group. When this practice happened en masse, it had the advantage of ensuring the strength and continuity of cultural and religious practices in medieval society.Judith and Martin Land, Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child, Wheatmark Publishing, 2011, p. ix Early Modern Europe saw the rise of foundling homes and increased abandonment of children to these homes. These numbers continued to rise and peaked when 5% of all births resulted in abandonment in France around 1830. The national reaction to this was to limit the resources provided by foundling homes and switch to foster homes instead such that fewer children would die within overcrowded foundling homes during infancy. As access to contraception increased and economic conditions improved in Europe towards the end of the 19th century the numbers of children being abandoned declined. Abandonment increased towards the end of the 19th century, particularly in the United States. The largest migration of abandoned children in history took place in the United States between 1853 and 1929. Over one hundred and twenty thousand orphans (not all of whom were intentionally abandoned) were shipped west on railroad cars, where families agreed to foster the children in exchange for their use as farmhands, household workers, etc. Orphan trains were highly popular as a source of free labor. The sheer size of the displacement as well as complications and exploitation that occurred gave rise to new agencies and a series of laws that promoted adoption rather than indenture. By 1945, adoption was formulated as a legal act with consideration of the child‚Äôs best interests. The origin of the move toward secrecy and the sealing of all adoption and birth records began when Charles Loring Brace introduced the concept to prevent children from the orphan trains from returning to or being reclaimed by their parents. Notable contemporary instances of child abandonment include homicidal neglect by confinement of infants or children such as in the affair of the Osaka child abandonment case or the affair of two abandoned children in Calgary, Alberta, Canada by their mother Rie Fujii. Current situation A modern Baby box or Baby hatch in the Czech Republic where a baby can be anonymously abandoned while ensuring that the child will be cared for. Today, abandonment of a child is considered to be a serious crime in many jurisdictions because it can be considered malum in se (wrong in itself) due to the direct harm to the child, and because of welfare concerns (in that the child often becomes a ward of the state and in turn, a burden upon the public fisc). For example, in the U.S. state of Georgia, it is a misdemeanor to willfully and voluntarily abandon a child, and a felony to abandon one's child and leave the state. In 1981, Georgia's treatment of abandonment as a felony when the defendant leaves the state was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.Jones v. Helms, . 'Rehoming' is still legal in Arkansas where, in 2015, state legislator Justin Harris made national headlines by rehoming two young adopted children.Benjamin Hardy, \\"Foster Family Disputes Key Statements from Justin Harris\\", The Arkansas Times, Many jurisdictions have exceptions to abandonment laws in the form of safe haven laws, which apply to babies left in designated places such as hospitals (see, for example, baby hatch). In the UK abandoning a child under the age of two years is a criminal offence. In 2004 49 babies were abandoned nationwide with slightly more boys than girls being abandoned. Abandonment is rife in Malaysia, where between 2005 and 2011, 517 babies were dumped. Of those 517 children, 287 were found dead. In 2012, there were 31 cases, including at least one instance of a child being tossed from a window of a high rise apartment. Persons in cultures with poor social welfare systems who are not financially capable of taking care of a child are more likely to abandon them. Several American states are moving towards passing legislation to prevent rehoming of children post adoption. However, national legislation may be needed to protect children from being rehomed in all states. = State programs for facilitating anonymous child abandonment = * Anonymous Birthing allows pregnant mothers to give birth to their child without revealing their identity or claiming any ownership over or legal obligation to the child. Different countries wait varying lengths of time from 2‚Äì8 weeks before putting the child up for adoption to allow mothers to return to the hospital and reclaim the child. Anonymous birthing is most often implemented as measure to prevent neonaticide and has been successful in multiple countries. Police in Austria report a 57% drop in neonaticides after the country passed a law allowing for anonymous birthing and free delivery in 2001. Anonymous birthing provides the opportunity for mothers to disclose relevant health history to later be shared with the child and adoptive family, as well as access to hospital care to reduce risk during birth. In some states, France for example, mothers who choose anonymous birthing undergo counselling and are informed of available support structures to help them keep the child. Mothers who are seeking to anonymously abandon their child at birth may avoid anonymous birthing due to increased interaction with hospital staff and the possibility of undergoing counselling. * Baby boxes provide a safe and anonymous way to abandon children, typically newborns, rather than resorting to infant exposure or neonaticide. Baby boxes can be found in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Korea, and the United States. Advantages of baby boxes include a greater degree of anonymity for parents abandoning their children and a guarantee that the child will be found and attended to. However, children are sometimes placed in baby boxes with existing issue or injury and baby boxes are under- utilized and costly to operate. It is also debated if baby boxes are an accessible option for rural mothers who may not be willing to travel to abandon their children. * Safe haven laws allow parents of a child, typically a newborn child but age can vary, to abandon the child at a place of local authority such as a hospital, fire station, or police station with no further question. Some states allow the parent to reclaim the child within a certain timeframe. Safe Haven Laws passed in the United States in 1999 and have since been adopted in Canada, Japan, France, and Slovakia. It is debated if safe haven laws prevent child abandonment or neonaticide. As with baby boxes, one study suggests that mothers in rural areas are not willing to travel to abandon their children and would not be willing to travel to a hospital to do so. As of 2017, 3,317 babies have been surrendered via safe haven laws in the United States. National laws and effects on child abandonment China‚Äôs One Child Policy: In 1979 China introduced its one-child policy which set up penalties for families that chose to have more than one child. Women were compelled to undergo a surgical implantation of an IUD following the birth of their first child and tubal ligation if they were to have another child. Families that disobeyed the law were levied a fine and lost their right to many government services, including access to health and educational services. Nevertheless, transgressions of the law most certainly occurred. Consequently, over the course of over three decades, hundreds of thousands of children, the majority of which were girls, were abandoned and required caretaking. Non- governmental organizations stepped in to assist with the re-housing of these girls, leading to the international adoption of over 120,000 Chinese children. Today, China's fertility rate has not quite returned to the rate of replacement (the birth rate that will maintain population size under conditions of zero net immigration/emigration). In fact, in the years since the relinquishing of the policy, China's fertility rate has only risen .04 per family. Vietnam War: During and following the Vietnam War, initiated by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations due to a fear of the spread of communism into southeastern Asia, it is estimated that roughly 50,000 babies were born of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers. A large contingent of these children were either unwanted to the circumstances of their conception or unable to be cared for due to the lack of available resources and assistance in the war-torn country. Locally, these children were known as \\"children of the dust.\\" Operation Babylift was established by the US government in an effort to bring over 3,300 children, many but not all of whom were abandoned, orphaned, or mixed-race leading to fears of their exploitation, to Western countries to be adopted with varying degrees of success. Non-governmental organizations attempted to alleviate the problem by setting up international adoptions and other rehoming methods but were largely ineffective. To this day, attempts are being made to link American veterans to children that they may have fathered during their time in Vietnam as well as children to their families in Vietnam. Romania under Nicolae Ceau»ôescu: During the rule of Communist politician Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, Romania underwent drastic changes to its populace. Ceau»ôescu, in an attempt to form a robust and young population, outlawed methods of contraception and encouraged the creation of large families with many children. Much like during the Fascist period of Italian history, incentives and cultural praise were offered to parents who produced many children. Ceau»ôescu established Decree 770 which outlawed abortion and contraception for all women, except those who were over 40, had already born 4‚Äì5 children, had life-threatening complications during pregnancy, or who became pregnant through rape or incest. In the following years, Romania‚Äôs birth rate nearly doubled. However, due to a lack of resources necessary to care for the abundance of children, thousands were abandoned or left to die. Other women resorted to unsafe forms of abortion carried out by people without medical training. The problem persisted until the coup that overthrew Ceau»ôescu in 1989. Following the coup, Romania's birthrate steadily declined for the following decades. Today, the birth rate has dropped to 1.52 births per woman, under the rate of replacement. In literature Foundlings, who may be orphans, can combine many advantages to a plot: mysterious antecedents, leading to plots to discover them; high birth and lowly upbringing. Foundlings have appeared in literature in some of the oldest known tales.Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism, p. 198. . The most common reasons for abandoning children in literature are oracles that the child will cause harm; the mother's desire to conceal her illegitimate child, often after rape by a god; or spite on the part of people other than the parents, such as sisters and mothers-in-law in such fairy tales as The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird. In some chivalric romances, such as Le Fresne and the Swan-Children, in the variant Beatrix, some children of a multiple birth are abandoned after the heroine has taunted another woman with a claim that such a birth is proof of adultery and then suffered such a birth of her own.Laura A. Hibbard (1963). Medieval Romance in England, p. 242. New York: Burt Franklin Poverty usually features as a cause only with the case of older children, who can survive on their own. Indeed, most such individuals are of royal or noble birth; their abandonment means they grow up in ignorance of their true social status.Josepha Sherman, Once upon a Galaxy, pp. 55‚Äì56. . =Abandonment= One of the earliest surviving examples of child abandonment in literature is that of Oedipus, who is left to die as a baby in the hills by a herdsman ordered to kill the baby, but is found and grows up to unwittingly marry his biological mother. In a common variant on the abandonment and rediscovery of an infant, the biblical story of Moses describes how the Jewish infant is abandoned by his mother and set to float in the Nile in a reed basket, in hopes that he will be found and nurtured; as planned, the child is discovered and adopted by the queen of Egypt, thus gaining a higher social status and better education, as well as a more powerful position than his birth family could have given him. A similar story is told of other heroes who eventually learn about their true origins only as adults, when they find they are able to save their original parents or family by wielding power from their adoptive status, while making use of an education that sets them apart from their peers. The theme is also carried through in the case of many modern superheroes, most famously Superman (see Modern Media below). Mark Twain tweaks the traditional \\"upgrading\\" of the foundling's social status by having the child's twin, who is powerful by birth, experience the \\"downgrading \\" of his position in a switch planned by the two children, in \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\". In many tales, such as Snow White, the child is actually abandoned by a servant who had been given orders to put the child to death. Other tales such as Hansel and Gretel has children reluctantly abandoned in the forest by their parents since they were no longer able to feed them. Children are often abandoned with birth tokens, which act as plot devices to ensure that the child can be identified. This theme is a main element in Angelo F. Coniglio's historical fiction novella The Lady of the Wheel, in which the title refers to a \\"receiver of foundlings\\" who were placed in a device called a \\"foundling wheel\\", in the wall of a church or hospital. In Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, a recognition scene in the final act reveals by these that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.Northrop Frye, \\"Recognition in The Winter's Tale,\\" pp. 108‚Äì109 of Fables of Identity: Studies in Poetic Mythology. . Similarly, when the heroine of Le Fresne reveals the brocade and the ring she was abandoned with, her mother and sister recognize her; this makes her a suitable bride for the man whose mistress she had been.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v. 2, p. 68. Dover Publications, New York, 1965. The children of Queen Blondine and of her sister, Princess Brunette, picked up by a Corsair after seven days at sea; illustration by Walter Crane to the fairy tale Princess Belle-Etoile. From Oedipus onward, Greek and Roman tales are filled with exposed children who escaped death to be reunited with their families‚Äîusually, as in Longus' Daphnis and Chloe, more happily than in Oedipus' case. Grown children, having been taken up by strangers, were usually recognized by tokens that had been left with the exposed baby: In Euripides's Ion, Cre√ºsa is about to kill Ion, believing him to be her husband's illegitimate child, when a priestess reveals the birth-tokens that show that Ion is her own, abandoned infant. This may reflect the widespread practice of child abandonment in their cultures. On the other hand, the motif is continued through literature where the practice is not widespread. William Shakespeare used the abandonment and discovery of Perdita in The Winter's Tale, as noted above, and Edmund Spenser reveals in the last Canto of Book 6 of The Faerie Queene that the character Pastorella, raised by shepherds, is in fact of noble birth. Henry Fielding, in one of the first novels recognized as such, recounted The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling. In the case of Quasimodo, the eponymous character in Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, the disfigured child is abandoned at the cathedral's foundling's bed, made available for the leaving of unwanted infants. Ruth Benedict, in studying the Zuni, found that the practice of child abandonment was unknown, but featured heavily in their folktales.Maria Tatar, The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales, p. 60. . Still, even cultures that do not practice it may reflect older customs; in medieval literature, such as Sir Degar√© and Le Fresne, the child is abandoned immediately after birth, which may reflect pre-Christian practices, both Scandavian and Roman, that the newborn would not be raised without the father's decision to do so.Barbara A. Hanawalt, The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England, p. 172. . =Upbringing= The strangers who take up the child are often shepherds or other herdsmen. This befell not only Oedipus, but also Cyrus II of Persia, Amphion and Zethus and several of the characters listed above. Romulus and Remus were suckled by a wolf in the wilderness, but afterward, again found by a shepherd. This ties this motif in with the genre of the pastoral. This can imply or outright state that the child benefits by this pure upbringing by unspoiled people, as opposed to the corruption that surrounded his birth family. Often, the child is aided by animals before being found; Artemis sent a bear to nurse the abandoned Atalanta, and Paris was also nursed by a bear before being found.Jane Yolen, Touch Magic, p. 73. . In some cases, the child is depicted as being raised by animals; however, in actuality, feral children have proven to be incapable of speech.Jane Yolen, Touch Magic, p. 74. . =In adulthood= The pattern of a child remaining with its adoptive parents is less common than the reverse, but it occurs. In the Indian epic Mahabharata, Karna is never reconciled with his mother, and dies in battle with her legitimate son. In the Grimm fairy tale Foundling-Bird, Foundling Bird never learns of, least of all reunites with, his parents. George Eliot depicted the abandonment of the character Eppie in Silas Marner; despite learning her true father at the end of the book, she refuses to leave Silas Marner, who had actually reared her. When the cause of the abandonment is a prophecy, the abandonment is usually instrumental in causing the prophecy to be fulfilled. Besides Oedipus, Greek legends also included Telephus, who was prophesied to kill his uncle; his ignorance of his parentage, stemming from his abandonment, caused his uncle to jeer at him and him to kill the uncle in anger. =Older children= When older children are abandoned in fairy tales, while poverty may be cited as a cause, as in Hop o' My Thumb, also called Thumbelina, the most common effect is when poverty is combined with a stepmother's malice, as in Hansel and Gretel (or sometimes, a mother's malice). The stepmother's wishes may be the sole cause, as in Father Frost. In these stories, the children seldom find adoptive parents, but malicious monsters, such as ogres and witches;Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p. 474. . outwitting them, they find treasure enough to solve their poverty. The stepmother may die coincidentally, or be driven out by the father when he hears, so that the reunited family can live happily in her absence. In a grimmer variation, the tale Babes in the Wood features a wicked uncle in the role of the wicked stepmother, who gives an order for the children to be killed. However, although the servants scruple to obey him, and the children are abandoned in the woods, the tale ends tragically: the children die, and their bodies are covered with leaves by robins. =In modern media= Foundlings still appear in modern literature; this is a partial list of examples: *In George Bernard Shaw's stage play Major Barbara, industrialist Andrew Undershaft, a foundling himself, intently searches for a foundling to assume the family business. *Superman may be seen as a continuation of the foundling tradition, the lone survivor of an advanced (but almost-completely extinct) civilization who is found and raised by Kansas farmers in a pastoral setting, and later discovers his alien origins and uses his powers for good.Josepha Sherman, Once upon a Galaxy, p. 55. . *Charlie Chaplin's movie The Kid revolves about the Tramp's efforts to raise an abandoned child. *In the graphic novel Aqua Leung, the main protagonist is a prince who is whisked out of a castle under attack in a basket-like device and then found by a couple and raised on land so that his father's enemies do not find him. He returns to the seas to fulfill the prophecy thought to be his father's but that was actually his. *Elora Danan, in the film Willow, and Lir, in the novel The Last Unicorn, both continue the tradition of foundlings abandoned because of prophecies, and who fulfil the prophecies because of their abandonment. *In the last book of The Chronicles of Prydain, Dallben reveals to the hero Taran that he is a foundling; in a story set in the same world, \\"The Foundling,\\" Dallben himself proves to be a foundling as well. *The character Leela from Futurama was a foundling, given to the Ophanarium and a note in an alien language to make people believe that she was an alien rather than a mutant; she would have been forced, in the latter case, to live in the sewers with the other mutants. *Several foundlings appear in Terry Pratchett's Discworld: most notably Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson, who was found, as a toddler, among the ruins of a caravan party that had been attacked by bandits, and was then surrounded by the bodies of the adults. *The character of Mozzie, from White Collar, is a foundling, left in a basket with only a bear. *In some cartoons, wily characters may disguise themselves as foundlings. This may be accomplished by the character dressing as a baby and lying in a bassinet or basket on a doorstep, perhaps with a note adding to the ruse. This was parodied in the 2006 movie Little Man. *In The Flintstones, Bamm-Bamm was abandoned on the Rubbles's doorstep and eventually adopted by them. See alsoReferencesFurther reading * Dorothy L.

United States, 238 U.S. 347 (1915), was a United States Supreme Court decision that found certain grandfather clause exemptions to literacy tests for voting rights to be unconstitutional. Though these grandfather clauses were superficially race neutral, they were designed to protect the voting rights of illiterate white voters while disenfranchising black voters. The 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution barred each state from denying the right to vote on the basis of \\"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\\" In response, several Southern states, including Oklahoma, established constitutional provisions designed to effectively disenfranchise African-American voters without explicitly violating the Fifteenth Amendment. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White held that Oklahoma's grandfather clause was \\"repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore null and void.\\" The decision had little immediate impact, as Southern legislatures found other methods to disenfranchise blacks. Background When Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, it had adopted a constitution which allowed men of all races to vote, in compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, legislators soon passed an amendment to the Constitution that required voters to satisfy a literacy test. A potential voter could be exempted from the literacy requirement if he could prove either that his grandfathers had been voters or had been citizens of some foreign nation, or had served as soldiers before 1866. As a result, illiterate whites were able to vote ‚Äî but not illiterate blacks, whose grandfathers had almost all been slaves and therefore barred from voting or serving as soldiers before 1866. Most states that had permitted free people of color to vote in early decades of the 19th century had rescinded that right before 1840. Thus, even blacks who might have descended from families free before the Civil War could not get an exemption from literacy tests. In practice these were highly subjective, administered by white registrars who discriminated against black voters. Oklahoma's amendment followed those of numerous Southern states that had similar grandfather clauses in their constitutions. The Oklahoma amendment provided: :\\"No person shall be registered as an elector of this state or be allowed to vote in any election held herein, unless he be able to read and write any section of the Constitution of the state of Oklahoma; but no person who was, on January 1, 1866, or any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form of government, or who at that time resided in some foreign nation, and no lineal descendant of such person, shall be denied the right to register and vote because of his inability to so read and write sections of such Constitution. Precinct election inspectors having in charge the registration of electors shall enforce the provisions of this section at the time of registration, provided registration be required. Should registration be dispensed with, the provisions of this section shall be enforced by the precinct election officers when electors apply for ballots to vote.\\" The amendment came into force before the election of November 8, 1910 was held. During that election, certain election officers refused to allow black citizens to vote; those officers were indicted and convicted of fraudulently disenfranchishing black voters, in violation of the 15th Amendment and in violation of Oklahoma State Law.  Fifteenth Amendment  The 15th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides the right to not be discriminated against while voting on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. It does not explicitly allow the right to vote, but instead provides a safeguard against disenfranchisement of legal adults on the basis of their skin color, race, or previous status as a slave from 1871 until now. For example, any southern state that did not remove the qualification of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to become a voter still must allow other nonwhite citizens to vote. The amendment voids any clauses in laws or statutes that prohibit voter franchise because of race, so taking the qualification of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù is merely symbolic, since any nonwhite adult male must be not be denied the right to vote anyway. As a result of the 15th Amendment, clauses such as the Grandfather Clause in the Constitution of Oklahoma would be voided of all racial discrimination if they were dependent upon the year 1871. Since they looked at relatives prior to 1866, however, there was technically a loophole that allowed discrimination.https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive- constitution/amendment/amendment-xv History of grandfather clauses The term ‚Äúgrandfathered in‚Äù has an inherently racist history. Grandfather clauses were used to allow whites to vote while disenfranchising black people who wanted to vote. The grandfather clause in Guinn v. United States involved literacy tests, and other states used poll taxes and constitutional quizzes to bar black access to voting. Since many poor illiterate whites in the South would lose their voting rights as well with these literacy tests and poll taxes, grandfather clauses were introduced. These clauses allowed poor, illiterate whites to register to vote if they had been able to vote before 1867 or if their ancestors could have voted then. This created loopholes around the 15th Amendment, since they could not legally bar people from registering to vote simply because they were not white. The laws had time limits, which were used to try and get as many white voters registered as possible before the laws were challenged in court. Since then, the term ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù has been deracialized since we do not associate it with the inherently racist clauses from the pasthttps://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial- history-of-the-grandfather-clause Case The case was argued before the Court on October 17, 1913. It represented the second appearance before the Court of John W. Davis as United States Solicitor General and the first case in which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a brief. The NAACP was increasingly active in such court challenges, eventually founding the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to support this work. After the case was argued and eventually appealed, the Supreme Court ruled that the Grandfather Clause of the Constitution of Oklahoma was created and intended to exclude as many illiterate black people as possible and include as many illiterate whites as possible. The number of black citizens allowed to vote under the clause approximately equals the number of white citizens barred from voting. This is undoubtedly proof of discrimination and differences in classifying whites and blacks into two classes of illiterates. Therefore, the entire amendment regarding illiteracy in voters is wholly unconstitutional, violating the 15th Amendment. The Clause was implemented as a way to try and avoid violating the 15th Amendment while still disenfranchising black voters. The previous conditions of servitude based on the race or skin color of people rendered them incapable of gaining literacy or meeting the ambiguously formed loopholes within said Clause. Therefore, the Court upheld the prior conviction against Guinn and Beal.http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep238/usrep238347/usrep238347.pdf Decision The Supreme Court handed down its decision in Guinn v. United States together with Myers v. Anderson, which concerned a grandfather clause in the Maryland constitution. In its decision handed down on June 21, 1915, the Court ruled \\"the grandfather clauses in the Maryland and Oklahoma constitutions to be repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore null and void.\\"Franklin, Moss p.353 In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White held that the grandfather clause was clearly designed to interfere with the voting rights protections of the Fifteenth Amendment even though it was racially neutral on it face. Opinions Justice Edward White wrote the majority opinion, writing that the Oklahoma law brings race-based discrimination ‚Äú\\"into existence since it is based purely on a period of time before the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment and makes that period the controlling and dominant test of the right of suffrage.‚Äù There were no dissenting opinions from the Supreme Court justices, which speaks to the strength of the case and how inherently discriminatory this law was. Aftermath Even though Guinn v. United States seemed to be a major step for black voters in the South, it conveyed a false sense of victory. Oklahoma immediately implemented a new voting statute which restricted voter registration, stating that \\"[a]ll persons, except those who voted in 1914, who were qualified to vote in 1916 but who failed to register between April 30 and May 11, 1916, with some exceptions for sick and absent persons who were given an additional brief period to register, would be perpetually disenfranchised.\\" After Guinn in Oklahoma, similar constitutional clauses were struck down in former slave states in the South like Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia, but just like Oklahoma, these states found other ways to disenfranchise black voters. After 23 years, the Supreme Court struck down the new Oklahoma statute in Lane v. Wilson. The Court ruled that the new statute still violated the Fifteenth Amendment because they were \\"operated unfairly against the very class on whose behalf the protection of the Constitution was here successfully invoked.\\" Guinn successfully paved the way for judicial intervention regarding voter discrimination and disenfranchisement of specific groups, although it did not immediately provide enfranchisement of black voters in the South, as was expected.https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/guinn-v-united- states-1915/https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/268/ See also * List of United States Supreme Court Cases * Civil rights movement (1896‚Äì1954) ReferencesExternal links  Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture - Guinn et al. v.

Warley, 245 U.S. 60 (1917), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States addressed civil government-instituted racial segregation in residential areas. The Court held unanimously that a Louisville, Kentucky city ordinance prohibiting the sale of real property to blacks in white- majority neighborhoods or buildings and vice versa violated the Fourteenth Amendment's protections for freedom of contract. The ruling of the Kentucky Court of Appeals was thus reversed. Prior state court rulings had overturned racial zoning ordinances on grounds of the \\"takings clause\\" because of their failures to grandfather land that had been owned prior to enactment. The Court, in Buchanan, ruled that the motive for the Louisville ordinance, separation of races for purported reasons, was an inappropriate exercise of police power, and its insufficient purpose also made it unconstitutional. Background The city of Louisville had an ordinance that forbade any black individuals to own or occupy any buildings in an area in which a greater number of white persons resided and vice versa. In 1915, William Warley, the prospective black buyer and an attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), made an offer to Charles H. Buchanan for his property in a predominately white neighborhood. He based his offer on the following condition: > It is understood that I am purchasing the above property for the purpose of > having erected thereon a house which I propose to make my residence, and it > is a distinct part of this agreement that I shall not be required to accept > a deed to the above property or to pay for said property unless I have the > right under the laws of the State of Kentucky and the City of Louisville to > occupy said property as a residence. Buchanan accepted the offer. When Warley did not complete the transaction, Buchanan brought an action in the Chancery Court of Louisville to force him to complete the purchase. Warley argued that Louisville's ordinance prevented him from occupying the property. Buchanan sued on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Decision The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with Buchanan: \\"The effect of the ordinance under consideration was not merely to regulate a business or the like, but was to destroy the right of the individual to acquire, enjoy, and dispose of his property. Being of this character, it was void as being opposed to the due process clause of the constitution.\\" Reversing the Appeals Court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the ordinance surpassed the legitimate grounds of police power, as it interfered with individuals' rights of property. In addition, the court noted that the ordinance neither regulated the race of servants who might be employed in certain areas nor counted them as members of the household. Justice Holmes wrote a draft opinion which suggested the case was \\"manufactured\\" by the seller and buyer. He withdrew the dissent and voted with the majority.

Buchanan was an assistant and special consultant to U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, and was an original host on CNN's Crossfire. He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996. He ran on the Reform Party ticket in the 2000 presidential election. He co-founded The American Conservative magazine and launched a foundation named The American Cause. He has been published in Human Events, National Review, The Nation, and Rolling Stone. He was a political commentator on the MSNBC cable network, including the show Morning Joe until February 2012, later appearing on Fox News. Buchanan was also a regular panelist on The McLaughlin Group. His political positions can generally be described as paleoconservative,\\"Unpatriotic Conservatives\\" David Frum, April 7, 2003, National Review. and many of his views, particularly his opposition to American imperialism and the managerial state, echo those of the Old Right Republicans of the first half of the 20th century. Early life Buchanan was born in Washington, D.C., a son of William Baldwin Buchanan (August 13, 1905, in Virginia ‚Äì January 1988 in Washington, D.C.), a partner in an accounting firm, and his wife Catherine Elizabeth (Crum) Buchanan (December 23, 1911, in Charleroi, Washington County, Pennsylvania ‚Äì September 18, 1995, in Oakton, Fairfax County, Virginia), a nurse and a homemaker. Buchanan had six brothers (Brian, Henry, James, John, Thomas, and William Jr.) and two sisters (Kathleen Theresa and Angela Marie, nicknamed Bay). Bay served as U.S. Treasurer under Ronald Reagan. His father was of Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, and his mother was of German descent. He had a great-grandfather who fought in the American Civil War in the Confederate States Army, which is why he is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. He admires Robert E. Lee, Douglas MacArthur and Joseph McCarthy. Of his southern ancestry, Buchanan has written: Buchanan was born into a Catholic family and attended Catholic schools, including the Jesuit-run Gonzaga College High School. As a student at Georgetown University, he was in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) but did not complete the program. He earned his bachelor's degree in English from Georgetown, and received his draft notice after he graduated in 1960. The District of Columbia draft board exempted Buchanan from military service because of reactive arthritis, classifying him as 4-F. He received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1962, writing his thesis on the expanding trade between Canada and Cuba. Career=St. Louis Globe- Democrat editorial writer= Buchanan joined the St. Louis Globe-Democrat at age 23. During the first year of the United States embargo against Cuba in 1961, Canada‚ÄìCuba trade tripled. The Globe-Democrat published a rewrite of Buchanan's Columbia master's project under the eight-column banner \\"Canada sells to Red Cuba ‚Äî And Prospers\\" eight weeks after Buchanan started at the paper. According to Buchanan's memoir Right from the Beginning, this article was a career milestone. Buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the communist regime and he turned against it. Buchanan was promoted to assistant editorial page editor in 1964 and supported Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. The Globe-Democrat did not endorse Goldwater and Buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Buchanan recalled: \\"The conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats ... I can't think of a single conservative who was sorry about the Goldwater campaign.\\" According to the foreword (written by Pat Buchanan) in the most recent edition of Conscience of a Conservative, Buchanan was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom and wrote press releases for that organization. He served as an executive assistant in the Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Mitchell law offices in New York City in 1965. =Work for the Nixon White House= Buchanan on July 12, 1969 The next year, he was the first adviser hired by Nixon's presidential campaign; he worked primarily as an opposition researcher. The highly partisan speeches Buchanan wrote were consciously aimed at Richard Nixon's dedicated supporters, for which his colleagues soon nicknamed him Mr. Inside. Buchanan traveled with Nixon throughout the campaigns of 1966 and 1968. He made a tour of Western Europe, Africa and, in the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War, the Middle East. During the course of Nixon's presidency, Buchanan became a trusted on press relations, policy positions, and political strategy. Early on during Nixon's presidency, Buchanan worked as a White House assistant and speechwriter for Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew. Buchanan coined the phrase \\"Silent Majority,\\" and helped shape the strategy that drew millions of Democrats to Nixon. In a 1972 memo, he suggested the White House \\"should move to re-capture the anti-Establishment tradition or theme in American politics.\\" His daily assignments included developing political strategy, publishing the President's Daily News Summary, and preparing briefing books for news conferences. He accompanied Nixon on his trip to China in 1972 and the summit in Moscow, Yalta and Minsk in 1974. He suggested that Nixon label Democratic opponent George McGovern an extremist and burn the White House tapes. Buchanan remained as a special assistant to Nixon through the final days of the Watergate scandal. He was not accused of wrongdoing, though some mistakenly suspected him of being Deep Throat. In 2005 when the actual identity of the press leak was revealed as Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director Mark Felt, Buchanan called him \\"sneaky,\\" \\"dishonest\\" and \\"criminal.\\" Because of his role in the Nixon campaign's \\"attack group,\\" Buchanan appeared before the Senate Watergate Committee on September 26, 1973. He told the panel: \\"The mandate that the American people gave to this president and his administration cannot, and will not, be frustrated or repealed or overthrown as a consequence of the incumbent tragedy\\". When Nixon resigned in 1974, Buchanan briefly stayed on as special assistant under incoming President Gerald Ford. Chief of Staff Alexander Haig offered Buchanan his choice of three open ambassador posts, including South Africa, for which Buchanan opted. President Ford initially signed off on the appointment, but then rescinded it after it was prematurely reported in the Evans-Novak Political Report and caused controversy, especially among the U.S. diplomatic corps.https://geraldrfordfoundation.org/centennial/oralhistory/pat-buchanan/ Buchanan remarked about Watergate: \\"The lost opportunity to move against the political forces frustrating the expressed national will ... To effect a political counterrevolution in the capital ‚Äî ... there is no substitute for a principled and dedicated man of the Right in the Oval Office\\". Long after his resignation, Nixon called Buchanan a confidant and said he was neither a racist nor an antisemite nor a bigot or \\"hater,\\" but a \\"decent, patriotic American.\\" Nixon said Buchanan had \\"some strong views,\\" such as his \\"isolationist\\" foreign policy, with which he disagreed. While Nixon did not think Buchanan should become president, he said the commentator \\"should be heard.\\" However, according to a memo President Nixon sent to John Ehrlichman in 1970, Nixon characterized Buchanan's attitude towards integration as \\"segregation forever\\". Following Nixon's re-election in 1972, Buchanan himself had written in a memo to Nixon suggesting he should not \\"fritter away his present high support in the nation for an ill-advised governmental effort to forcibly integrate races.\\" =News commentator= Buchanan returned to his column and began regular appearances as a broadcast host and political commentator. He co-hosted a three-hour daily radio show with liberal columnist Tom Braden called the Buchanan-Braden Program. He delivered daily commentaries on NBC radio from 1978 to 1984. Buchanan started his TV career as a regular on The McLaughlin Group and CNN's Crossfire (inspired by Buchanan-Braden) and The Capital Gang, making him nationally recognizable. His several stints on Crossfire occurred between 1982 and 1999; his sparring partners included Braden, Michael Kinsley, Geraldine Ferraro, and Bill Press. Buchanan was a regular panelist on The McLaughlin Group. He appeared most Sundays alongside John McLaughlin and the more liberal Newsweek journalist Eleanor Clift. His columns are syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate. =Work for the Reagan White House= Buchanan in 1985 Buchanan served as White House Communications Director from February 1985 to March 1987. In a speech to the National Religious Broadcasters in 1986, Buchanan said of the Reagan administration: \\"Whether President Reagan has charted a new course that will set our compass for decadesor whether history will see him as the conservative interruption in a process of inexorable national declineis yet to be determined\\". A year later, he remarked that \\"the greatest vacuum in American politics is to the right of Ronald Reagan.\\" While her brother was working for Reagan, Bay Buchanan started a \\"Buchanan for President\\" movement in June 1986. She said the conservative movement needed a leader, but Buchanan was initially ambivalent. After leaving the White House, he returned to his column and Crossfire. Out of respect for Jack Kemp he sat out the 1988 race, although Kemp later became his adversary. Political campaigns=1992 presidential primaries= Logo used for Buchanan's 1992 and 1996 campaigns Buchanan at the Florida State Capitol in 1992 In 1990, Buchanan published a newsletter called Patrick J. Buchanan: From the Right; it sent subscribers a bumper sticker reading: \\"Read Our Lips! No new taxes.\\" In 1992, Buchanan explained his reasons for challenging the incumbent, President George H.W. Bush: He ran on a platform of immigration reduction and social conservatism, including opposition to multiculturalism, abortion, and gay rights. Buchanan challenged Bush (whose popularity was waning) when he won 38% of the New Hampshire primary. In the primary elections, Buchanan garnered three million total votes or 23% of the vote. Buchanan later threw his support behind Bush and delivered an address at the 1992 Republican National Convention, which became known as the culture war speech, in which he described \\"a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America.\\" In the speech, he said of Bill and Hillary Clinton: Buchanan also said, in reference to the then recently-held 1992 Democratic National Convention, \\"Like many of you last month, I watched that giant masquerade ball at Madison Square Garden‚Äîwhere 20,000 radicals and liberals came dressed up as moderates and centrists‚Äîin the greatest single exhibition of cross-dressing in American political history.\\" The enthusiastic applause he received prompted his detractors to claim that the speech alienated moderates from the Bush-Quayle ticket. The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins wrote: \\"Many people did not care for Pat Buchanan's speech; it probably sounded better in the original German.\\" =Off the campaign trail= Buchanan returned to his column and Crossfire. To promote the principles of federalism, traditional values, and anti-intervention, he founded The American Cause, a conservative educational foundation, in 1993. Bay Buchanan serves as the Vienna, VA-based foundation's president and Pat is its chairman. Buchanan returned to radio as host of Buchanan and Company, a three-hour talk show for Mutual Broadcasting System on July 5, 1993. It pitted him against liberal co- hosts, including Barry Lynn, Bob Beckel, and Chris Matthews, in a time slot opposite Rush Limbaugh's show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995. =1996 presidential primaries= Buchanan made another attempt to win the Republican nomination in the 1996 primaries. With Democratic President Bill Clinton seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President George H.W. Bush having made clear he was not interested in re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Majority Leader, who was considered to have many weaknesses. Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and the multi-millionaire publisher Steve Forbes. In February, the liberal Center for Public Integrity issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, Larry Pratt, appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the Manchester Union Leader he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence \\"to answer these charges,\\" \\"so as not to have distraction in the campaign.\\" Buchanan defeated Dole by about 3,000 votes to win the February New Hampshire primary. He was endorsed by conservative Phyllis Schlafly, among others. He won three other states (Alaska, Missouri, and Louisiana), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the Iowa caucus. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland Washington establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said: In the Super Tuesday primaries Dole defeated Buchanan by large margins. Having collected only 21% of the total votes or 3.1 million in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a pro-choice running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now Constitution Party) candidate. Dole chose Jack Kemp and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and Crossfire. He also began a series of books with 1998's The Great Betrayal. =2000 presidential campaign= right Buchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \\"beltway party.\\" He sought the nomination of the Reform Party. Many reformers backed Iowa physicist John Hagelin, whose platform was based on Transcendental Meditation. Party founder Ross Perot did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party's nomination. (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot's 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.) Supporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \\"tainted.\\" The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party. Ultimately, when the Federal Elections Commission ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the 1996 election, Buchanan won the nomination. In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the UN from New York, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Housing and Urban Development, taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and affirmative action programs. As his running mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, Ezola B. Foster. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future Socialist Party USA presidential candidate Brian Moore, who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \\"he was for fair trade over free trade. He had some progressive positions that I thought would be helpful to the common man.\\" On August 19, the New York Right to Life Party, in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90% of the districts voting for him. In a campaign speech at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, Buchanan attempted to rally his conservative base: In the 2000 presidential election, Buchanan finished fourth with 449,895 votes, 0.4% of the popular vote. (Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the Natural Law candidate.) In Palm Beach County, Florida, Buchanan received 3,407 voteswhich some saw as inconsistent with Palm Beach County's liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous \\"butterfly ballot\\", he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer stated, \\"Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.\\" Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500. Appearing on The Today Show, Buchanan said: \\"When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it's very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for Al Gore\\". Some observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed. =Later presidential elections= Following the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the neo- conservative Republican party leadership. Prior to the 2004 election, Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 re-election, writing: \\"Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values. Kerry is right on nothing\\". Buchanan also endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, stating in an article that \\"Obama offers more of the stalemate America has gone through for the past two years\\" while \\"Romney alone offers a possibility of hope and change.\\" Buchanan supported the nomination of Donald Trump, who ran on many of the same positions that Buchanan ran on twenty years prior, as Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 presidential election. Later media activities=MSNBC commentator= Buchanan being interviewed in 2008 Although CNN decided not to take him back, Buchanan's column resumed. A longer variation of the Crossfire format was aired by MSNBC as Buchanan and Press on July 15, 2002, reuniting Buchanan and Press. Billed as \\"the smartest hour on television\\", Buchanan and Press featured the duo interviewing guests and sparring about the top news stories. As the Iraq War loomed, Buchanan and Press toned down their rivalry, as they both opposed the invasion.Bloom, Jordan (June 6, 2012) When News Is Propaganda The American Conservative. Press claims they were the first cable hosts to discuss the planned attack. MSNBC Editor-in-Chief Jerry Nachman once jokingly lamented this unusual situation: Just hours after his talk show debuted, Buchanan was a guest on the premiere of MSNBC's ill-fated Donahue program. Host Phil Donahue and Buchanan debated the separation of church and state. Buchanan called Donahue \\"dictatorial\\" and said that the host got his job through affirmative action. MSNBC President Eric Sorenson canceled Buchanan and Press on November 26, 2003. Buchanan stayed at MSNBC as a political analyst. He regularly appeared on the network's talk shows. He occasionally filled in on the nightly show Scarborough Country during its run on MSNBC. Buchanan also was a frequent guest and co-host of Morning Joe as well as Hardball and The Rachel Maddow Show. In September 2009, Buchanan wrote an MSNBC opinion column defending Adolf Hitler. The article was removed from the website after MSNBC was urged to do so in a public statement by the National Jewish Democratic Council. Buchanan had used the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the German invasion of Poland to argue that Britain should not have declared war on Germany. This revived charges of antisemitism and helping to legitimize Holocaust denial. In October 2011, Buchanan was indefinitely suspended from MSNBC as a contributor after the publication of his book Suicide of a Superpower. One of the book's chapters is titled, \\"The End of White America.\\" The minority advocacy group Color of Change had urged MSNBC to fire him over alleged racist slurs.Associated Press, January 7, 2012, MSNBC chief says he hasn't decided whether commentator Pat Buchanan will return to network , hosted The Washington Post, accessed January 7, 2012. It was announced on February 16, 2012 that MSNBC's connection with Buchanan had ended. =The American Conservative magazine= In 2002, Buchanan partnered with former New York Post editorial page editor Scott McConnell and journalist Taki Theodoracopulos to found The American Conservative, a new magazine intended to promote traditional conservative viewpoints on economic, immigration and foreign policies. The first issue was dated October 7, 2002. Accusations of antisemitism and Holocaust denial In December 1991, a 40,000-word article by William F. Buckley Jr. was published in the National Review discussing antisemitism among conservative commentators focused largely on Buchanan; the article and many responses to it were collected in the book In Search of Anti-Semitism (1992). He concluded: \\"I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism\\". The Anti-Defamation League has called Buchanan an \\"unrepentant bigot\\" who \\"repeatedly demonizes Jews and minorities and openly affiliates with white supremacists.\\" In article for The Washington Post in March 1992, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer suggested: \\"The real problem with Buchanan ... is not that his instincts are antisemitic but that they are, in various and distinct ways, fascistic.\\" \\"There's no doubt,\\" said Krauthammer in 1999 when contacted for a Salon article, \\"he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice.\\" He added: \\"The interesting thing is how he can say these things and still be considered a national figure.\\" Buchanan denies assertions that he is an antisemite, and some of his fellow journalists, including Murray Rothbard, Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. =Nazi war criminals= Around 1982, Buchanan began to defend Cleveland auto-worker John Demjanjuk against the charge that Demjanjuk was a Nazi war criminal nicknamed \\"Ivan the Terrible\\" responsible for the mass murder of Jews at Treblinka. In 1986, while he was a senior figure in the Reagan administration, he was highly critical of the charges brought by Office of Special Investigations (OSI), the Nazi war crimes unit of Justice Department. He claimed Demjanjuk was the victim of mistaken identity and possibly the victim of a plot by the Soviet Union. The following year, while still a member of the administration, he made unofficial attempts to stop the deportation of suspected Nazi war criminals from East Europe, including Estonian Karl Linnas as well as Demjanjuk. Menachem Z. Rosensaft, in a New York Times op-ed, described Buchanan's \\"oft- expressed sympathy for a host of Nazi criminals\\" like Linnas as being \\"a constitutionally protected perversion\\". Buchanan referred to such cases as being pursued by \\"revenge-obsessed Nazi hunters\\" in 1987. As a member of the Reagan White House, he was accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In 1990, Allan Ryan Jr., a former head of the OSI said Buchanan's accusation of KGB involvement in the Demjanjuk case was \\"an absolutely cockamamie theory.\\" Ryan accused Buchanan of being \\"the spokesman for Nazi war criminals in America\\". Neal Sher, OSI head in 1990 said Buchanan had never contacted them, even when he was a government official. \\"He essentially took what was fed him by our opponents, sometimes Holocaust- deniers, and just regurgitated it,\\" Sher told The Washington Post. In 2009, Menachem Z. Rosensaft in The Times of Israel and Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic, objected to Buchanan in his syndicated column comparing Demjanjuk to Jesus Christ and Buchanan calling him an \\"American Dreyfuss\\". It was viewed by Goldberg as an example of the libel that the Jews as a whole killed Christ. Describing Buchanan's comparison as \\"strikingly offensive\\" and an attempt to \\"revive the charge of blood libel\\" against Jews, Peter Wehner wrote in Commentary magazine: \\"Rarely do you find such an obscene mix of blasphemy and bigotry, and all in less than 900 words\\". The former guard had been deported to Germany where he was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor extermination camp. =Bitburg visit by President Reagan= Buchanan supported President Reagan's plan to visit a German military cemetery at Bitburg in 1985, where among buried Wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 Waffen SS members. At the insistence of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and over the vocal objections of Jewish groups, the trip went ahead. In a 1992 interview, Elie Wiesel described attending a White House meeting of Jewish leaders about the trip: \\"The only one really defending the trip was Pat Buchanan, saying, 'We cannot give the perception of the President being subjected to Jewish pressure.'\\" Buchanan accused Wiesel of fabricating the story in an ABC interview in 1992: \\"I didn't say it and Elie Wiesel wasn't even in the meeting ... That meeting was held three weeks before the Bitburg summit was held. If I had said that, it would have been out of there within hours and on the news\\".quoted by Crossfire, CNN, February 24, 1992, Transcript # 514. =Comments on the Holocaust= In a 1990 column for the New York Post, Buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850,000 Jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at Treblinka in a return to his interest in the Demjanjuk case. \\"Diesel engines do not emit enough carbon monoxide to kill anybody,\\" he wrote. The Washington Post cited the belief of experts who said there is more than sufficient carbon monoxide present in the fumes to speedily asphyxiate victims causing their death.Patrick J. Buchanan. \\"Ivan the Terrible' - More Doubts\\", New York Post, March 17, 1990. Buchanan once argued Treblinka \\"was not a death camp but a transit camp used as a 'pass-through point' for prisoners\\". In fact, some 900,000 Jews died at Treblinka.Lichtblau, Eric, (2015) The Nazis Next Door, How America Became a Save Haven for Hitler's Men, p. 194, Published by Houghton, Mifflin, Harcourt, Boston. When George Will challenged him on the issue on TV in December 1991, Buchanan did not reply. =Comments about Israel= In the context of the Gulf War, on August 26, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said: \\"there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East ‚Äì the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States.\\" Buchanan on The McLaughlin Group on June 15 1990, asserted: \\"Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory\\". He also said in the August 1990 program: \\"The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world.\\" A.M. Rosenthal, in an article for The New York Times explicitly accused Buchanan of antisemitism on the grounds that he had used the word \\"Israelis\\" as a cover for Jews. Abraham Foxman, the director of the ADL, compared Buchanan's comments to insinuations made during the second world war \\"that Jews were the only ones who sought American entry in the war against Nazi Germany\\". Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel in September 1990 said Buchanan \\"leaves the memory of Jewish victims in such disdain; a man who always takes the side of those accused of being killers; a man who is constantly criticizing Israel; a man who always has something nasty to say about the Jewish people\\". Statements on race and immigration=Central Park Five= In a 1989 column, Buchanan called for the lynching of a 16-year old black teenager and the horsewhipping of four other younger African-American and Hispanic teenagers for having allegedly raped a white jogger in the Central Park Five case. He also called for the civilization of \\"barbarians\\" by putting the \\"fear of death\\" in them. Robert C. Smith, professor of political science at San Francisco State University, characterized the column as racist. The five teenagers were convicted but later exonerated - in 2002, the actual perpetrator of the crime confessed, DNA testing showed that he was guilty, and the convictions for the five teenagers were overturned. Personal life Buchanan's wife Shelley in 1996 Buchanan married White House staffer Shelley Ann Scarney in 1971. Their longtime tabby cat, Gipper, was named after the nickname of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, and reportedly sat on Buchanan's lap during staff meetings. Buchanan identifies as a Traditionalist Catholic who attends Mass in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, and strongly defended Summorum Pontificum.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prevents prosecutors from using a person's statements made in response to interrogation in police custody as evidence at their trial unless they can show that the person was informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning, and of the right against self- incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them. Miranda was viewed by many as a radical change in American criminal law, since the Fifth Amendment was traditionally understood only to protect Americans against formal types of compulsion to confess, such as threats of contempt of court. It has had a significant impact on law enforcement in the United States, by making what became known as the Miranda warning part of routine police procedure to ensure that suspects were informed of their rights. The Supreme Court decided Miranda with three other consolidated cases: Westover v. United States, Vignera v. New York, and California v. Stewart. The Miranda warning (often shortened to \\"Miranda\\", or \\"Mirandizing\\" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is required to be given by law enforcement in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial situation) before they are interrogated, in accordance with the Miranda ruling. The purpose of such is to ensure the accused are aware of, and reminded of, these rights before questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court decision Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010), criminal suspects who are aware of their right to silence and to an attorney, but choose not to \\"unambiguously\\" invoke them, may find any subsequent voluntary statements treated as an implied waiver of their rights, and used as or as part of evidence. At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda.Charles Weisselberg and Stephanos Bibas, The Right to Remain Silent, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. PENNumbra 69 (2010), Available at: http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/2181 (Retrieved May 2, 2016)  Background = Legal = During the 1960s, a movement which provided defendants with legal aid emerged from the collective efforts of various bar associations. In the civil realm, it led to the creation of the Legal Services Corporation under the Great Society program of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Escobedo v. Illinois, a case which closely foreshadowed Miranda, provided for the presence of counsel during police interrogation. This concept extended to a concern over police interrogation practices, which were considered by many to be barbaric and unjust. Coercive interrogation tactics were known in period slang as the \\"third degree\\". = Factual = On March 13, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested by the Phoenix Police Department, based on circumstantial evidence linking him to the kidnapping and rape of an eighteen-year-old woman ten days earlier.Miranda also matched the description given by a robbery victim of the perpetrator in a robbery several months earlier. He was simultaneously interrogated about both of these crimes, confessed to both, but was not asked to and did not write down his confession to the robbery. He was separately tried and convicted of the robbery and sentenced to 20 to 25 years of imprisonment. This crime, trial, and sentence is separate from the rape- kidnapping case appealed to the Supreme Court. After two hours of interrogation by police officers, Miranda signed a confession to the rape charge on forms that included the typed statement: \\"I do hereby swear that I make this statement voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion, or promises of immunity, and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.\\"Michael S. Lief and H. Mitchell Caldwell \\"'You Have the Right to Remain Silent,'\\" American Heritage, August/September 2006. However, at no time was Miranda told of his right to counsel. Before being presented with the form on which he was asked to write out the confession that he had already given orally, he was not advised of his right to remain silent, nor was he informed that his statements during the interrogation would be used against him. At trial, when prosecutors offered Miranda's written confession as evidence, his court-appointed lawyer, Alvin Moore, objected that because of these facts, the confession was not truly voluntary and should be excluded. Moore's objection was overruled, and based on this confession and other evidence, Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping. He was sentenced to 20‚Äì30 years of imprisonment on each charge, with sentences to run concurrently. Moore filed Miranda's appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, claiming that Miranda's confession was not fully voluntary and should not have been admitted into the court proceedings. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision to admit the confession in State v. Miranda, 401 P.2d 721 (Ariz. 1965). In affirmation, the Arizona Supreme Court heavily emphasized the fact that Miranda did not specifically request an attorney.Miranda's oral confession in the robbery case was also appealed and the Arizona Supreme Court likewise affirmed the trial decision to admit it in State v. Miranda, 401 P.2d 716. This case was not part of the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Attorney John Paul Frank, former law clerk to Justice Hugo Black, represented Miranda in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Supreme Court decision  On June 13, 1966, the Supreme Court issued a 5‚Äì4 decision in Miranda's favor that overturned his conviction and remanded his case back to Arizona for retrial. =Opinion of the Court= Five justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The Court ruled that because of the coercive nature of the custodial interrogation by police (Warren cited several police training manuals that had not been provided in the arguments), no confession could be admissible under the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause and Sixth Amendment right to an attorney unless a suspect has been made aware of his rights and the suspect has then waived them: Thus, Miranda's conviction was overturned. The Court also made clear what must happen if a suspect chooses to exercise his or her rights: Justice Brennan's comments on the Miranda decision. Warren also pointed to the existing procedures of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which required informing a suspect of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel, provided free of charge if the suspect was unable to pay. If the suspect requested counsel, \\"the interview is terminated.\\" Warren included the FBI's four-page brief in his opinion. However, the dissenting justices accused the majority of overreacting to the problem of coercive interrogations, and anticipated a drastic effect. They believed that, once warned, suspects would always demand attorneys, and deny the police the ability to gain confessions. = Clark's concurrence in part, dissent in part = In a separate concurrence in part, dissent in part, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that the Warren Court went \\"too far too fast.\\" Instead, Justice Clark would use the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test enunciated by Justice Goldberg in Haynes v. Washington. Under this test, the court would: = Harlan's dissent = In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that \\"nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy-handed and one-sided action that is so precipitously taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities.\\" Harlan closed his remarks by quoting former Justice Robert H. Jackson: \\"This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.\\" = White's dissent = Justice Byron White took issue with the court having announced a new constitutional right when it had no \\"factual and textual bases\\" in the Constitution or previous opinions of the Court for the rule announced in the opinion. He stated: \\"The proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination forbids in-custody interrogation without the warnings specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment.\\" White did not believe the right had any basis in English common law. White further warned of the dire consequences of the majority opinion:  Subsequent developments =Retrial= Miranda was retried in 1967 after the original case against him was thrown out. This time the prosecution, instead of using the confession, introduced other evidence and called witnesses. One witness was Twila Hoffman, a woman with whom Miranda was living at the time of the offense; she testified that he had told her of committing the crime.State v. Miranda, 104 Ariz. 174, 176, 450 P.2d 364, 366 (1969). Miranda was convicted in 1967 and sentenced to serve 20 to 30 years. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed,State v. Miranda, 104 Ariz. 174, 450 P.2d 364 (1969) and the United States Supreme Court denied review.396 U.S. 868 (1969). Miranda was paroled in 1972. After his release, he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers' \\"Miranda cards\\" that contained the text of the warning for reading to arrestees. Miranda was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar on January 31, 1976. A suspect was arrested, but due to a lack of evidence against him, he was released.Charles Montaldo, Miranda Rights and Warning: Landmark Case Evolved from 1963 Ernesto Miranda Arrest, about.com; accessed 13 June 2014. Another three defendants whose cases had been tied in with Miranda's ‚Äì an armed robber, a stick-up man, and a bank robber ‚Äì either made plea bargains to lesser charges or were found guilty again despite the exclusion of their confessions. =Reaction= The Miranda decision was widely criticized when it came down, as many felt it was unfair to inform suspected criminals of their rights, as outlined in the decision. Richard Nixon and other conservatives denounced Miranda for undermining the efficiency of the police, and argued the ruling would contribute to an increase in crime. Nixon, upon becoming President, promised to appoint judges who would reverse the philosophy he viewed as \\"soft on crime.\\" Many supporters of law enforcement were angered by the decision's negative view of police officers. =Miranda warning= After the Miranda decision, the nation's police departments were required to inform arrested persons or suspects of their rights under the ruling prior to custodial interrogation. Such information is called a Miranda warning. Since it is usually required that the suspects be asked if they understand their rights, courts have also ruled that any subsequent waiver of Miranda rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.See, e.g., Many American police departments have pre-printed Miranda waiver forms that a suspect must sign and date (after hearing and reading the warnings again) if an interrogation is to occur. Data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports shows a sharp reduction in the clearance rate of violent and property crimes after Miranda. However, according to other studies from the 1960s and 1970s, \\"contrary to popular belief, Miranda had little, if any, effect on detectives' ability to solve crimes.\\" =Legal developments= The federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 purported to overrule Miranda for federal criminal cases and restore the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test that had prevailed previous to Miranda. The validity of this provision of the law, which is still codified at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3501, was not ruled on for another 30 years because the Justice Department never attempted to rely on it to support the introduction of a confession into evidence at any criminal trial. Miranda was undermined by several subsequent decisions that seemed to grant exceptions to the Miranda warnings, challenging the ruling's claim to be a necessary corollary of the Fifth Amendment. The exceptions and developments that occurred over the years included: * The Court found in Harris v. New York, , that a confession obtained in violation of the Miranda standards may nonetheless be used for purposes of impeaching the defendant's testimony; that is, if the defendant takes the stand at trial and the prosecution wishes to introduce the defendant's confession as a prior inconsistent statement to attack the defendant's credibility, the Miranda holding will not prohibit this. * The Court found in Rhode Island v. Innis, , that a \\"spontaneous\\" statement made by a defendant while in custody, even though the defendant has not been given the Miranda warnings or has invoked the right to counsel and a lawyer is not yet present, is admissible in evidence, as long as the statement was not given in response to police questioning or other conduct by the police likely to produce an incriminating response. * The Court found in Berkemer v. McCarty, , that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in Miranda, regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which he is suspected or for which he was arrested. * The Court found in New York v. Quarles, , that there is also a \\"public safety\\" exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given before questioning; for example, if the defendant is in possession of information regarding the location of an unattended gun or there are other similar exigent circumstances that require protection of the public, the defendant may be questioned without warning and his responses, though incriminating, will be admissible in evidence. In 2009, the California Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Richard Allen Davis, finding that the public- safety exception applied despite the fact that 64 days had passed from the disappearance of the girl later found to be murdered.People vs. Davis, S056425. * The Court found in Colorado v. Connelly, , that the words \\"knowing, intelligent, and voluntary\\" mean only that suspects reasonably appear to understand what they are doing and are not being coerced into signing the waiver; the Court ruled that it is irrelevant whether the suspect may actually have been cognitively or mentally impaired at the time. United States v. Garibay (1998) clarified an important matter regarding the scope of Miranda. Defendant Jose Garibay barely spoke English and clearly showed a lack of understanding; indeed, \\"the agent admitted that he had to rephrase questions when the defendant appeared confused.\\" Because of the defendant's low I.Q. and poor English-language skills, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that it was a \\"clear error\\" when the district court found that Garibay had \\"knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights.\\" The court investigated his waiver and discovered that it was missing all items for which they were looking: he never signed a waiver, he only received his warnings verbally and in English, and no interpreter was provided although they were available. With an opinion that stressed \\"the requirement that a defendant 'knowingly and intelligently' waive his Miranda rights,\\" the Court reversed Garibay's conviction and remanded his case. Miranda survived a strong challenge in Dickerson v. United States, , when the validity of Congress's overruling of Miranda through ¬ß 3501 was tested. At issue was whether the Miranda warnings were actually compelled by the Constitution, or were rather merely measures enacted as a matter of judicial policy. In Dickerson, the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Rehnquist, upheld Miranda 7‚Äì2 and stated that \\"the warnings have become part of our national culture\\". In dissent, Justice Scalia argued that Miranda warnings were not constitutionally required. He cited several cases demonstrating a majority of the then-current court, counting himself, and Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, and Thomas, as well as Rehnquist (who had just delivered a contrary opinion), \\"[were] on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution.\\" Over time, interrogators began to devise techniques to honor the \\"letter\\" but not the \\"spirit\\" of Miranda. In the case of Missouri v. Seibert, , the Supreme Court halted one of the more controversial practices. Missouri police had been deliberately withholding Miranda warnings and questioning suspects until they obtained confessions, then providing the warnings, getting waivers, and eliciting confessions again. Justice Souter wrote for the plurality: \\"Strategists dedicated to draining the substance out of Miranda cannot accomplish by training instructions what Dickerson held Congress could not do by statute.\\" Hosted by Duke University School of Law. Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010) was a ruling in which the Supreme Court held that a suspect's \\"ambiguous or equivocal\\" statement, or lack of statements, does not mean that police must end an interrogation.Berghuis v. Thompkins, . At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda. In The Right to Remain Silent, Charles Weisselberg wrote that \\"the majority in Thompkins rejected the fundamental underpinnings of Miranda v. Arizona's prophylactic rule and established a new one that fails to protect the rights of suspects\\" and that > But in Thompkins, neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General were able to > cite any decision in which a court found that a suspect had given an implied > waiver after lengthy questioning. Thompkins persevered for almost three > hours before succumbing to his interrogators. In finding a waiver on these > facts, Thompkins gives us an implied waiver doctrine on steroids. =Effect on law enforcement= Miranda‚Äôs impact on law enforcement remains in dispute. Many legal scholars believe that police have adjusted their practices in response to Miranda and that its mandates have not hampered police investigations. Others argue that the Miranda rule has resulted in a lower rate of conviction, with a possible reduction in the rate of confessions of between four and sixteen percent. Some scholars argue that Miranda warnings have reduced the rate at which the police solve crimes, while others question their methodology and conclusions.

A unanimous Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., concluded that defendants who distributed flyers to draft- age men urging resistance to induction could be convicted of an attempt to obstruct the draft, a criminal offense. The First Amendment did not alter the well-established law in cases where the attempt was made through expressions that would be protected in other circumstances. In this opinion, Holmes said that expressions which in the circumstances were intended to result in a crime, and posed a \\"clear and present danger\\" of succeeding, could be punished. The Court continued to follow this reasoning to uphold a series of convictions arising out of prosecutions during wartime, but Holmes began to dissent in the case of Abrams v. United States, insisting that the Court had departed from the standard he had crafted for them, and had begun to allow punishment for ideas. However, the Court has set another line of precedents to govern cases in which the constitutionality of a statute is challenged on its face. In 1969, Schenck was partially overturned by Brandenburg v. Ohio, which limited the scope of banned speech to that which would be directed to and likely to incite imminent lawless action (e.g. a riot). Background Schenck was the first in a line of Supreme Court cases defining the modern understanding of the First Amendment. Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. wrote the often-cited opinion in the case, because of events that were not publicly known at the time. The United States' entry into the First World War had caused deep divisions in society, and was vigorously opposed, especially by those on the radical left and by those who had ties to Germany. The Wilson administration launched a broad campaign of criminal enforcement that resulted in thousands of prosecutions. Many of these were for trivial acts of dissent. In the first case arising from this campaign to come before the Court, Baltzer v. United States, the defendants had signed a petition criticizing their governor's administration of the draft, threatening him with defeat at the polls. They were charged with obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service, and convicted. When a majority of the Court voted during their conference to affirm the conviction, Holmes quickly drafted and circulated a strongly worded dissenting opinion: > Real obstructions of the law, giving real aid and comfort to the enemy, I > should have been glad to see punished more summarily and severely than they > sometimes were. But I think that our intention to put out all our powers in > aid of success in war should not hurry us into intolerance of opinions and > speech that could not be imagined to do harm, although opposed to our own. > It is better for those who have unquestioned and almost unlimited power in > their hands to err on the side of freedom.Sheldon Novick, \\"The Unrevised > Holmes and Freedom of Expression,\\" 1991 Supreme Court Review 303, 389 (1992) Rather than proceed in the face of Holmes's biting dissent, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White set the case aside and word of the situation evidently reached the Administration, because the prosecution was abandoned. White then asked Holmes to write the opinion for a unanimous Court in the next case, one in which they could agree, Schenck v. United States. Holmes wrote that opinion, and wrote again for a unanimous court upholding convictions in two more cases that spring, Frohwerk v. United States and Debs v. United States, establishing what remains the standard for deciding the constitutionality of criminal convictions based on expressive behavior. Holmes disliked legislative-style formulas, and did not repeat the language of \\"clear and present danger\\" in any subsequent opinion, however. The Schenck opinion alone accordingly is often cited as the source of this legal standard, and some scholars have suggested that Holmes changed his mind and offered a different view in his equally famous dissent in Abrams v. United States. The events leading to the assignment of the Schenck opinion to Holmes were discovered when Holmes's biographer Sheldon Novick unearthed the unpublished Baltzer opinion among Holmes's papers at Harvard Law School.Sheldon Novick, \\"Preface, Honorable Justice at twenty-five,\\" in Honorable Justice: The Life of Oliver Wendell Holmes (1989, 2013) The facts of the Schenck Case were as follows. Charles Schenck and Elizabeth Baer were members of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia, of which Schenck was General Secretary. The executive committee authorized, and Schenck oversaw, printing and mailing more than 15,000 fliers to men slated for conscription during World War I. The fliers urged men not to submit to the draft, saying \\"Do not submit to intimidation\\", \\"Assert your rights\\", \\"If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain,\\" and urged men not to comply with the draft on the grounds that military conscription constituted involuntary servitude, which is prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment.Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 49-51 (1917) After jury trials Schenck and Baer were convicted of violating Section 3 of the Espionage Act of 1917., which prohibited willful obstruction of the recently-enacted draft. Both defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court, arguing that their conviction, and the statute which purported to authorize it, were contrary to the First Amendment. They relied heavily on the text of the First Amendment, and their claim that the Espionage Act of 1917 had what today one would call a \\"chilling effect\\" on free discussion of the war effort.Brief of Plaintiffs in Error - Schenk The Court's decision Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., held that Schenck's criminal conviction was constitutional. The statute only applied to successful obstructions of the draft, but common-law precedents allowed prosecution for attempts that were dangerously close to success. Attempts made by speech or writing could be punished like other attempted crimes; the First Amendment did not protect speech encouraging men to resist induction, because, \\"when a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.\\" In other words, the court held, the circumstances of wartime allow greater restrictions on free speech than would be allowed during peacetime, if only because new and greater dangers are present. The opinion's most famous and most often quoted passage was this: > The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in > falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in > every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are > of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will > bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It > is a question of proximity and degree. The phrase \\"shouting fire in a crowded theater\\" has since become a popular metaphor for dangers or limitations of free speech. Subsequent jurisprudence In subsequent cases, when it appeared to him that the Court was departing from the precedents established in Schenck and companion cases, Holmes dissented, reiterating his view that expressions of honest opinion were entitled to near absolute protection, but that expressions made with the specific intent to cause a criminal harm, or that threatened a clear and present danger of such harm, could be punished. In Abrams v. United States, he elaborated on the common-law privileges for freedom of speech and of the press, and stated his conviction that freedom of opinion was central to the constitutional scheme because competition in the \\"marketplace\\" of ideas was the best test of their truth. In Whitney v. California (1927), concerning a conviction for seditious speech forbidden by California law, Holmes joined a concurring opinion written by Justice Louis D. Brandeis once again explaining the clear-and-present-danger standard for criminal attempts in these terms, reiterating the argument that political speech was protected because of the value of democratic deliberation. The Supreme Court continued to affirm convictions for seditious speech in a series of prosecutions of leftists, however, culminating in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951) in which a bitterly divided Court upheld the sedition convictions for the leaders of the Communist Party. Judge Learned Hand in the court below and Chief Justice Vinson for the plurality in the Supreme Court cited Schenck, and the language of \\"clear and present danger\\" accordingly fell into disfavor among the advocates of free speech and freedom of the press. A unanimous Court in a brief per curiam opinion in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), abandoned the disfavored language while seemingly applying the reasoning of Schenck to reverse the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member prosecuted for giving an inflammatory speech. The Court said that speech could be prosecuted only when it posed a danger of \\"imminent lawless action,\\" a formulation which is sometimes said to reflect Holmes reasoning as more fully explicated in his Abrams dissent, rather than the common law of attempts explained in Schenck. Brandenburg is also taken to have repudiated the clear-and-present-danger standard as construed in Dennis, and to have adopted something more like the explication given by Holmes and Brandeis in subsequent opinions. Partly because the standard for protecting expressive behavior under the First Amendment was stated differently in his different opinions, \\"revisionist\\" scholars have argued that Holmes changed his mind in the summer of 1919, and that after writing three opinions for a unanimous court, he stated a different and more liberal view in his Abrams dissent a few weeks later.Albert W. Alschuler, Law Without Values: The Life, Work, and Legacy of Justice Holmes; Chicago University Press, 2000, , pp 76-77, citing numerous commentaries Bolstered by this argument, a number of advocates for freedom of expression have insisted that the Supreme Court has rejected Schenck and the majority opinion in Abrams, and in practice has followed the reasoning of Holmes' Abrams dissent and Brandeis' and Holmes' concurring opinion in Whitney.Thomas Healey, The Great Dissent: How Oliver Wendell Holmes Changed his Mind--and Changed the History of Freedom of Speech in America (2013) The Court has repeatedly reaffirmed Schenck, however, holding that the destruction of a draft card could be prosecuted as a violation of Selective Service regulations even though carried out as a protest (United States v. O'Brien), but that burning an American flag at a protest could not be prosecuted because it posed no danger of causing a harm that the legislature had power to forbid (Texas v. Johnson). In 2010, the Supreme Court rejected the argument of Holmes's Abrams dissent. The facts in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project were similar to those in Abrams: persons who planned to advocate the causes of Sri Lankan and Kurdish organizations, designated terrorist groups, had a reasonable fear of prosecution under the USA PATRIOT Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2339B, for providing material support for terrorist organizations. The Supreme Court held that such prosecutions were not barred by the First Amendment, expressly rejecting the argument that a \\"specific intent\\" to assist terrorist acts was required, rejecting also the claim of the dissenting justices that the case was governed by the concurrence in Whitney, or by the standard stated in Brandenburg. Finally, in Citizens United v. FEC, the majority of the Court rejected the argument made by the dissenters that the First Amendment was premised on the value of democratic deliberation in the \\"marketplace of ideas.\\" Instead, they held that First Amendment rights are individual, not based on communitarian considerations.

Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that dealt with the extent to which police pressure resulting in a criminal defendant's confession violates the Due Process clause.. Case  The case was argued on January 6, 1940, in front of the court by Thurgood Marshall (who was 32 years old at the time), representing four black men convicted for the murder of a white man in Florida. The defendant Chambers, along with three other co-defendants, were four of up to forty transient black men arrested for the murder of Robert Darcy, an elderly local man, in Pompano Beach, Florida. The community was outraged by the murder, and the Broward County Sheriff's department was apparently under pressure to close the case. Chambers and the other defendants were taken to Miami for questioning, ostensibly to protect them from the mob that had formed, and then to Fort Lauderdale. The state did not contest that the defendants were held without access to legal counsel, and were not arraigned for a week. They were subjected to questioning on a random basis, often alone in a room with up to ten police officers and other members of the community. In the legal climate before Miranda, they were not informed of their right to remain silent. After a week of questioning, and despite previous denials, the four co-defendants eventually confessed to the crime and were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Their convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida.Chambers v. State, 136 Fla. 568, 187 So. 156 (1939). Decision On February 13, 1940, the court delivered its ruling. The opinion of the court was delivered by Justice Hugo Black of Alabama. This was Marshall's first of many triumphs in front of the nation's highest tribunal; the Court ruled in favor of the defendants, and overturned their convictions. The court found that on the facts admitted by the police and sheriff's officers, the confessions had clearly been compelled and were therefore inadmissible. It marked one of the first times that the court had accepted the contention that treatment short of physical violence should result in the suppression of evidence. Several of the features of this case, such as not allowing a defendant to contact anyone, holding them without formal charges or arraignment, and denying them counsel during questioning were common tactics in law enforcement at the time and were eventually rejected by the court in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), a case in which Marshall argued on behalf of the United States government as Solicitor General of the United States.See appearances of counsel listing in Miranda decision. Aftermath In subsequent proceedings before the Florida courts, the indictment against the defendants was quashed on the ground that blacks had been arbitrarily and intentionally excluded from the grand jury.

Florida"},{"id":"168897","text":"On December 7, 1993, a Long Island Railroad train pulled into the Merillon Avenue station in Garden City, New York, United States, when passenger Colin Ferguson pulled out a 9 mm pistol and started firing at other passengers. He murdered six people and wounded nineteen others before being stopped by N.Y. State Court Officers. Ferguson's trial was notable for a number of unusual developments, including his firing his defense counsel and insisting on representing himself and questioning his own victims on the stand. On February 17, 1995, Ferguson was convicted of the six murders. He was also convicted of attempted murder for wounding nineteen passengers. , he is serving his sentence of 315 years and eight months to life at the Upstate Correctional Facility in Franklin County, New York. Shooting On December 7, 1993, Colin Ferguson purchased a ticket for the 5:33 p.m. eastbound train at the Flatbush Avenue station in Brooklyn which stopped at the Jamaica station in Queens. He boarded the third car of the eastbound Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) commuter train from Penn Station to Hicksville, along with more than 80 other passengers. He sat on the southwestern end of the car, carrying a Ruger P89 handgun and a canvas bag filled with 160 rounds of ammunition. As the train approached the Merillon Avenue station, Ferguson drew the gun, dropped several cartridges on the ground, stood up, and opened fire at random. During the next three minutes, he killed six people and injured another nineteen. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, \\"He's got a gun! He's shooting people!\\" Ferguson walked east (forward) on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to the eastern end of the train and tried to enter the next car. Ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing. The New York Times wrote that the motions were \\"as methodical as if he were taking tickets.\\" Ferguson said, \\"I'm going to get you,\\" over and over as he walked down the aisle. Other passengers farther away in the train did not realize that a shooting had occurred until after the train stopped, as a crowd of panicked passengers fled from the third car into neighboring cars. One man appeared annoyed by their unruliness and said, \\"Be calm,\\" before they forced a train door open and fled into the station. Two people were injured in the stampede of passengers. The train's conductor was informed of the shooting, but he decided against opening the train doors right away because two of the cars were not yet at the platform. An announcement was made ordering conductors not to open the doors, but engineer Thomas Silhan climbed out the window of his cab and opened each door from the outside so that panicked passengers could escape. Ferguson had emptied two 15-round magazines during the shooting. While he was reloading his third magazine, somebody yelled, \\"Grab him!\\" Passengers Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee tackled him and pinned him to one of the train's seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and helped to pin him across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, \\"Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? I deserve whatever I get.\\" He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him: \\"Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\\" Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief. Ferguson was held down for several minutes; Andrew Roderick, an off-duty LIRR police officer who was picking up his wife from the train, then boarded the train and handcuffed him. =Victims= Six passengers died from their wounds: *Amy Federici (27), a corporate interior designer from Mineola, New York. *James Gorycki (51), an account executive from Mineola. *Maria Theresa Tumangan Magtoto (30), a lawyer from Westbury, New York. *Dennis McCarthy (52), an office manager from Mineola. His son Kevin was severely wounded. His wife Carolyn McCarthy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996. *Richard Nettleton (24), a college student from Roslyn Heights, New York. *Mi Kyung Kim (27) from New Hyde Park, New York. The wounded included Robert Giugliano, Brendan Doyle, and Mary Ann Phillips. Perpetrator Colin Ferguson was born in Kingston, Jamaica on January 14, 1958 to Von Herman and May Ferguson. Von Herman was a wealthy pharmacist and the managing director of the large pharmaceutical company Hercules Agencies, and was described by Time magazine as \\"one of the most prominent businessmen in Jamaica\\". Ferguson attended the Calabar High School in Red Hills Road, Kingston from 1969 to 1974, where the principal described him as a \\"well-rounded student\\" who played cricket and soccer. He graduated in the top third of his class. Von Herman was killed in a car crash in 1978 when Ferguson was 20 years old, and his funeral was attended by government and military luminaries. Ferguson's mother died from cancer soon afterwards, and the deaths destroyed the family's fortunes. Family friends said that this deeply disturbed Ferguson, and he moved to the United States in 1982 on a visitor's visa. His friends supposed that he had trouble dealing with racism in America and that he felt frustrated because he couldn't find work outside of menial jobs. Ferguson married Audrey Warren on May 13, 1986, a native of Southampton County, Virginia, which qualified him for permanent U.S. residence. The couple moved to a house on Long Island where they often fought, sometimes to the point that police intervention was required. On May 18, 1988, she obtained an uncontested divorce from Ferguson, claiming that the marriage ended because they had \\"differing social views\\". Acquaintances said that she left Ferguson because he was \\"too aggressive or antagonistic\\" for her, and that the divorce was a \\"crushing blow\\" to Ferguson. Ferguson got a job doing clerical work for the Ademco Security Group in Syosset, New York on Long Island. He slipped and fell on August 18, 1989 while standing on a stool to reach invoices from a filing cabinet, injuring his head, neck, and back, and the injury led to his termination. He filed a complaint with the state workers' compensation agency, which reviewed the matter over the next several years. Ferguson enrolled at Nassau Community College in East Garden City, where he made the dean's list three times. Also that year, he was forced to leave a class after a disciplinary hearing board found that he had acted overly aggressively towards the teacher. In late 1990, Ferguson transferred to Adelphi University in Garden City, where he majored in business administration. He spoke out against coexistence with whites, routinely made calls for retributive revolution, and regularly accused others around him of racism. On one occasion, he complained that a white woman in the library shouted racial epithets at him after he asked her about a class assignment, but an investigation concluded that the incident never occurred. Later, he attended a symposium by a faculty member discussing her experiences in South Africa. Ferguson interrupted the professor by shouting, \\"We should be talking about the revolution in South Africa and how to get rid of the white people\\" and \\"kill everybody white!\\" Students and teachers tried to quieten him, but he started threatening them, repeatedly saying, \\"The black revolution will get you.\\" He was suspended from the school in June 1991 as a result of the threats. Although he was free to reapply after the suspension, he chose not to. In 1991, Ferguson rented a room in Flatbush, Brooklyn. He was unemployed and lived around many other West Indian immigrants. Neighbors said that he dressed very neatly but kept to himself and rarely smiled or spoke to anybody, except occasionally to say hello. \\"He had delusions of grandeur,\\" his landlord Patrick Denis recounted. \\"He felt like, 'I'm such a great person. There must be only one thing holding me back. It must be white people.'\\" In 1992, Ferguson's ex-wife filed a complaint with police alleging that he pried open the trunk of her car. Prior to the shooting, she had not seen him since the divorce. In February 1992, Ferguson was arrested and charged with harassing a woman on a subway. The woman tried to sit in a vacant seat alongside Ferguson and asked him to move over, prompting him to scream at her and press his leg and elbow against her until police officers pinned him to the ground. Ferguson tried to escape the police and shouted, \\"Brothers, come help me!\\" He sent letters to the New York City Police Commissioner and other officials complaining about his arrest, describing it as \\"viscous and racist,\\" and claiming that he was brutalized by the officers who arrested him. The New York City Transit Authority investigated and dismissed the claims. In September 1992, Ferguson was awarded $26,250 for his workers' compensation claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, he insisted that he was still in pain and demanded that the case be reopened so that he could get more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, Ferguson visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation, and attorney Lauren Abramson said that she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by him. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because she did not want to be alone with him, which she had never done before. Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, but he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, he made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming that they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre which occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed him on a list of potentially dangerous people whom security guards were to watch for. In April 1993, Ferguson moved to California in search of new career opportunities. He unsuccessfully applied for several jobs, including at a car wash where the manager laughed at him. Ferguson purchased a Ruger P89 9√ó19mm pistol at a Turner's Outdoorsman in Long Beach for $400 after waiting the 15-day period required under California's gun laws. He presented himself as a California resident by providing a driver's license that he received two months earlier, which had an address of the Long Beach motel where he stayed. He was robbed by two men, so he started carrying the gun with him in a paper bag. Ferguson moved back to New York in May 1993 because, as he told a friend, he did not like competing with immigrants and Hispanics for jobs. His Flatbush landlord said that he appeared even more unstable upon his return, speaking in the third person about \\"some apocryphal-type doom scenario\\" which included black people rising up and striking down \\"their pompous rulers and oppressors.\\" Ferguson started taking five showers a day and could be heard by neighbors repeatedly chanting at night \\"all the black people killing all the white people.\\" His landlord became increasingly concerned about Ferguson's obsession with racism and apparent growing mental instability, and asked him to move out by the end of the month. Investigation Police detectives later said it appeared Ferguson had been planning the shooting for more than a week. LIRR police chief Joseph Flynn said, \\"This was the work of a deranged, maniacal person who for a variety of reasons decided to explode.\\" None of Ferguson's victims were black, although it was unclear whether any other black passengers were aboard the train. Ferguson showed no emotion as he sat in the back of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself. Upon seeing Ferguson, one of the victims became hysterical and shouted, \\"How can he be sitting there so calm after everything he did?\\" Police found pieces of notebook paper in Ferguson's pockets with scribbled notes with the heading \\"reasons for this\\". One of the notes referred to \\"racism by Caucasians and Uncle Tom Negroes\\". They included a reference to \\"the false allegations against me by the filthy Caucasian racist female on the #1 line\\", a reference to his February 1992 arrest. Ferguson's notes expressed anger towards the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, Asians, Governor Mario Cuomo, and \\"so-called civil right leaders such as the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, C. Vernon Mason, and Calvin Butts.\\" They also included the names and telephone numbers of the Lt. Governor, the Attorney General, and the Manhattan law firm that Ferguson had previously threatened, whom he referred to as \\"those corrupt 'black' attorneys who not only refuse to help me but tried to steal my car\\". The notes indicated Ferguson planned to wait to start the killings until he was beyond the New York City limit out of respect for outgoing Mayor David Dinkins and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. Ferguson showed no remorse during hours of questioning from the Nassau County District Attorney's Office. Officials there said, \\"He was lucid and clear and aware of what was going on.\\" Ferguson was arraigned on December 8, 1993. He never spoke during the arraignment and did not enter a plea. He was ordered held without bail. As Ferguson was escorted from the courthouse, a reporter asked him if he hated whites, to which Ferguson replied, \\"It's a lie\\". Reaction President Bill Clinton took notice of the LIRR shooting, calling it a \\"terrible human tragedy\\". The day after the shooting, Clinton announced he had asked Attorney General Janet Reno to review a proposal by New York City Mayor-elect Rudy Giuliani that would set up a national uniform licensing system for gun buyers. Clinton cited the Ferguson murders as a factor in his support of the program, which would include background checks, tests and required renewals every two years. About one week after the shooting, Clinton visited with O'Connor, Blum and McEntee. During his first major speech since his election as mayor, Giuliani cited the Ferguson murders while he repeated his previous calls for the death penalty and a uniform gun licensing law. During his monthly radio call-in show, Governor Mario Cuomo called the Ferguson shootings \\"a dramatic, spectacular slaughter\\", and called for stronger gun control measures. U.S. Senator Al D'Amato said the Ferguson case demonstrated the need for capital punishment in New York State because \\"that is the only fitting punishment for this cold- blooded killer\\". Many African-Americans expressed concern that the LIRR shooting would lead to a backlash of violence and racial animosities against the black community. Civil rights activists Al Sharpton and Herbert Daughtry urged that African-Americans in general not be blamed for the crime; Sharpton, in particular, criticized what he called attempts \\"to demonize black and Hispanic dissatisfaction\\" by linking those groups to the murders. Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson delivered a sermon at the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, during a service attended by the victims' grieving families. Audrey Warren released a statement shortly after the shootings expressing sorrow for the victims and their families. Jackson stressed the shootings were the result of one man and should not be seen as indicative of all African- Americans. The day after the shootings, Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta called Ferguson \\"an animal.\\" Jackson and other African-American leaders criticized the comment as racially charged, but Gulotta later said his statement had nothing to do with race. During a press conference in the days after the shooting, the Long Island Rail Road Police Benevolent Association called the trains \\"unsafe\\" and said the railroad needed to triple the size of its 216-person police force. LIRR officials responded by noting that the rate of crime against passengers had dropped over the past few years before the shooting. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad placed more officers on trains and increased the visibility of police in response to the shootings. LIRR officials also made counselors available for passengers who wanted one, and sent senior railroad officials out to trains to answer riders' questions. A New York Times editorial called for stronger gun control laws in response to the murders, specifically citing the ease with which Ferguson obtained a handgun in California, which had one of the country's stricter gun laws. Several Adelphi University students expressed concern that Ferguson may have been taking the train to the school with plans of shooting people out of revenge for his past experiences there, although the train Ferguson took was not the closest one to Adelphi. Most of the regular commuters who used the 5:33 Hicksville local returned to the train the day after the shootings. In interviews with the media, a number of passengers cited the need to face their fears and the psychological trauma created by the incident, rather than avoid riding their regular train.  Litigation =Pre-trial=Early court appearances Anthony J. Falanga was appointed Ferguson's attorney on December 11, 1993. Falanga called for his client to receive a psychiatric evaluation. Under New York state law, an insanity defense would require Ferguson's lawyers to prove he suffers from a mental disease or defect and, as a result, could not tell whether his actions were right or wrong. At the time, lawyers and mental health experts said such a defense would be difficult because Ferguson appeared to have carefully planned the attacks, and because he said, \\"oh God, what did I do\\" after he was stopped. However, media outlets and legal experts at the time speculated a defense could argue Ferguson suffered from paranoia, particularly based on Ferguson's history of irrational racism allegations and claims that whites were discriminating against him. Ferguson was placed on suicide watch in the Nassau County Jail. On December 18, 1993 Ferguson asked a judge to let him replace Falanga with Colin A. Moore, a Brooklyn-based attorney with a reputation for pursuing allegations of racism in the criminal-justice system. Moore offered to represent Ferguson pro bono. Before a ruling was even made on the request, Moore held a press conference announcing he would seek a change of venue to Brooklyn, claiming it was impossible for Ferguson to receive a fair trial in a Nassau court due to a \\"severe underrepresentation of African- Americans on the Nassau County jury panel.\\" Later, Moore withdrew his offer to represent Ferguson, citing conflicts he did not explain. Ferguson told a judge he questioned Falanga's integrity, disagreed with his handling of the case and had no intention of cooperating with him. Dr. Allen Reichman, a psychiatrist who interviewed Ferguson, indicated in his report that Ferguson may have been feigning mental illness when he spoke of conspiracies against him. Reichman said Ferguson's assertions were \\"vague and somewhat evasive,\\" in contrast to the normally detailed and highly focused nature of systematized paranoid delusional thinking. On January 5, 1994, a report by a court-appointed psychologist and psychiatrist concluded Ferguson was suffering from paranoid personality disorder but was competent to stand trial. Indictment On January 19, 1994, after three days of evidence presentation, a grand jury handed up a 93-count indictment against Ferguson, which carried the possibility of up to 175 years in prison. Nassau County District Attorney Denis Dillon said of the sentence maximum; \\"it's not quite infinity, but it will do.\\" Dillon also announced he would not agree to any plea bargain in the case. The indictment included two counts of murder for each slain victim, both for intentional murder and for depraved indifference to human life. It also included 19 counts of attempted murder, 34 counts of assault, criminal possession of a weapon, intent to use the weapon, violation of civil rights of each of the 25 victims and \\"intent to harass, annoy, threaten and alarm\\" the victims \\"because of their race, color or national origin.\\" William Kunstler (pictured) and his law partner, Ron Kuby, agreed to provide Colin Ferguson free legal representation On March 1, 1994, William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, law partners known for representing unpopular clients, announced they had accepted a request by Ferguson to handle his case. Kunstler, who said he would not collect a fee for the defense, said Ferguson had been made out to be a \\"pariah\\" by the media and public. In April 1994, District Attorney Dillon sought a gag order for all lawyers involved in the case, arguing Kunstler and Kuby had made statements to the media that might be inadmissible during the trial and could influence potential jurors. Kunstler and Kuby argued they would have no problem finding 12 unbiased jurors and claimed Ferguson had already been publicly attacked in the press by government and police officials. Nassau County Judge Donald E. Belfi rejected the gag order on April 23, claiming the impact of inflammatory statements already made by lawyers, politicians and police would fade in the months before the trial begins. However, Belfi warned attorneys from both sides to follow a State Court professional disciplinary rule that already limits their comments to news organizations. Prison attacks Shortly after his incarceration began, Ferguson complained about his treatment, claiming correction officers attacked him with milk crates and a fire extinguisher, while depriving him of necessities like soap and antiperspirant spray. Ferguson said: \\"Of course, there is no sympathy for me in the institution. When I suffered and screamed I was told that it was a good sign by the prison guards because they were hoping for my swift departure from life.\\" Later, Ron Kuby argued Ferguson had been a frequent target of harassment at the Nassau County jail, and requested the United States Department of Justice intervene to ensure Ferguson's safety. On March 23, 1994, while returning to his cell from the medical unit, Ferguson was attacked in jail by a group of inmates. Ferguson suffered a broken nose and a swollen left eye. Prison officials had been notified by Kuby that an assault was imminent, and were in the process of following up on the warning when Ferguson was attacked. Kuby, who said he had been warned of the attack by another inmate, stated \\"the word was out. Everyone in the institution knew he was going to be set up.\\" Kuby called the attack racially motivated, and later alleged some jail officials and guards had advance knowledge of the impending assault. Five inmates were charged with second-degree assault for their connection in the attack. In November 1994, Ferguson's lawyers claimed prison guards taunted him with claims that the election of Governor George Pataki, a death penalty supporter, meant Ferguson would be executed if found guilty. Ferguson's lawyers claimed prison guards showed him the headlines of newspaper stories about Pataki and claimed Ferguson was \\"headed for electrocution sometime soon.\\" Ferguson was deeply troubled by the claims, despite assurances from his attorneys that the death penalty could only be imposed in crimes committed after a capital punishment bill became law. Ferguson was not reassured until after a judge told him the same thing, at the request of Kunstler. \\"Black rage\\" defense Kunstler and Kuby proposed an innovative defense; Ferguson had been driven to temporary insanity by a psychiatric condition they termed \\"black rage.\\" Kunstler and Kuby argued Ferguson had been driven insane by racial prejudice, and could not be held criminally liable for his actions even though he had committed the killings. The attorneys compared it to the utilization of the battered woman defense, posttraumatic stress disorder and the child abuse syndrome in other cases to negate criminal liability. Kuby said the notes carried by Ferguson on the day of his arrest demonstrated that Ferguson was motivated by rage during the shootings. Donald E. Belfi, the Nassau County Judge assigned to the Ferguson case, criticized Kunstler for speaking to the media about the proposed defense before it had been examined by a mental health professional. Belfi said \\"Mr. Kunstler may have many talents, but until he receives his medical degree with a specialty in psychiatry, these types of conclusions should best be left for medical experts and the triers of the facts.\\" Black rage was first proposed by psychologists William Henry Grier and Price Cobbs in their 1968 book, Black Rage (). Grier and Cobbs argue that black people living in a racist, white supremacist society are psychologically damaged by the effects of racist oppression. They argue that this damage causes black people to act abnormally in certain situations. Ferguson started to claim he was not involved in the Long Island Rail Road shootings at all, and repeatedly refused to meet with a psychiatrist chosen by Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson told the attorneys he was receiving messages straight from God, and spoke of conspiracies to destroy him by those opposed to God. On August 12, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby asked Judge Belfi to reconsider Ferguson's competence to stand trial, claiming he was growing more delusional, paranoid and obsessive by the day, and that he was too mentally unbalanced for them to mount any kind of defense. George Peck, the prosecutor in Ferguson's trial, insisted Ferguson's apparent lack of cooperation with his lawyers was a defense tactic to avoid a trial. On August 20, 1994, Ferguson appeared before Belfi and rejected his lawyer's efforts to have him declared mentally unfit to stand trial. Ferguson spoke in a long and rambling manner, occasionally ignoring Belfi when the judge tried to interrupt him. Ferguson claimed a police officer who escorted him from the Nassau County Jail said to him; \\"you realize someone else, in fact, was actually responsible for the shooting.\\" When asked if Ferguson understood the role of the prosecuting attorney, Ferguson replied; \\"to perpetrate injustices against me.\\" Kunstler and Kuby argued Ferguson's behavior was indicative of his mental imbalance. But Belfi refused the lawyers' request to reconsider his competence, citing the original psychiatric report that concluded Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was \\"malingering in an attempt to create an impression\\" that he was mentally imbalanced and unable to cooperate with his attorney. When Belfi ended the proceeding, Ferguson tried to continue talking. After he was placed into handcuffs by guards, Ferguson shouted \\"they have made it too tight,\\" collapsed to the floor, and had to be dragged from the courtroom. Denis Dillon suggested Kunstler was trying to create \\"such a bizarre situation\\" that the court would reverse its earlier ruling regarding Ferguson's competence. Removal of Kunstler and Kuby On September 20, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby filed notice that they would pursue an insanity defense despite the objections of their client. Ferguson continued to claim he was not involved in the shootings and proposed defending himself during the trial. In the following months, Ferguson sent Judge Belfi several letters regarding disputes between Ferguson, Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson claimed in the letters that he was not insane, and rejected Kunstler's and Kuby's \\"black rage\\" defense. Although George Peck argued the letters proved Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was actively participating in his defense, Kuby argued the letters only further demonstrated Ferguson's confused state of mind. On November 11, Ferguson agreed he would stop resisting efforts to meet with a court-appointed psychiatrist. As a result, Judge Belfi agreed to hold a third hearing as to whether Ferguson was mentally competent to stand trial. On December 10, 1994, Judge Belfi ruled Ferguson was competent to stand trial. Belfi said he based his decision in part on his conversations with Ferguson in the courtroom, including Ferguson's concern over Governor Pataki's promise to sign a death- penalty bill. Belfi strongly advised Ferguson against defending himself, but Ferguson said he intended to defend himself. Kuby said of the decision, \\"What we will have now is a complete circus. A crazy man cannot defend himself. Mr. Ferguson, evidence to the contrary, believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train.\\" Kuby continued, \\"Without a psychiatric defense, Ferguson has no defense. There was no doubt that he was there, that he fired the weapon, that he would have fired it more had he not been wrestled to the ground. There is no doubt that Colin Ferguson, if sane, was guilty.\\" =Trial= Ferguson's trial proved to be bizarre, as he cross- examined the police officers that arrested him and victims he shot. It was broadcast live by local media and Court TV, but was overshadowed by the O.J. Simpson murder case, going on simultaneously on the West Coast. Ferguson argued that the 93 counts he was charged with were related to the year 1993, and had it been 1925 he would have been charged with only 25 counts. He admitted bringing the gun onto the train, but claimed he fell asleep, and another man grabbed his gun and began firing. He also argued of a mysterious man named Mr. Su, who had information concerning a conspiracy against him. He also found another man who was willing to testify the government implanted a computer chip in Ferguson's brain, but at the last minute decided not to call him to the stand. This individual, Raul Diaz, was a parapsychologist from Manhattan and claimed during a press conference on the courthouse steps to have witnessed an Oriental man press a chip into Ferguson's head prior to the attack. According to Diaz, the Oriental man told him to behold what he was about to do prior to pushing the button. \\"He was lasered out by a remote- control device,\\" Diaz told reporters outside the courtroom. \\"He was zapped, just like that, right out of the twilight zone\\" and was \\"commanded to go up and down the aisle shooting people.\\" His cross-examination questions mostly started with \\"is it your testimony...\\" and would simply force the witness to repeat testimony already given. When a witness refused to answer the question to his satisfaction, he would often ask the judge to \\"admonish the witness to answer the question.\\" During the course of his cross-examinations, Ferguson would refer to himself in the third person, most particularly asking the victims of the shooting; \\"did you see Colin Ferguson ...\\" to which the witness would reply \\"I saw you shoot me.\\" Legal experts pointed out that Ferguson's questions were pointless and were not geared towards rebutting testimony. By not recognizing when to object to testimony and closing arguments, he lost his right to appeal on those grounds. Among the defense witnesses Ferguson requested was President Bill Clinton. Ferguson originally sought to question himself on the witness stand, but ultimately did not do so. He told the judge and media outlets he intended to call a number of witnesses who would prove his innocence, including a ballistic expert, a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses, but they were afraid to come forward and take the stand. Ultimately, he did not call any of the witnesses. He also told Judge Belfi of an alleged conspiracy by the Jewish Defense League to kill him in prison if he was convicted. He said the prison slaying of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was \\"set up as a prelude against me.\\" =Conviction= Ferguson was convicted on February 17, 1995, of murder of the six passengers who died of their injuries. He was also convicted of attempted murder for wounding nineteen passengers. He received 315 years and eight months to life, meaning his current earliest possible parole date is August 6, 2309. The judge said, \\"Colin Ferguson will never return to society, and will spend the rest of his natural life in prison.\\" At the sentencing, Judge Donald E. Belfi called Ferguson a \\"selfish, self-righteous coward.\\" He also used the sentencing as an opportunity to criticize New York's controversial Sentencing Cap Law, which would have capped Ferguson's sentence at 50 years had no one died in the massacre because all of the felonies he committed on the train were part of one occurrence, therefore all sentences would have been served concurrently and capped at 50 years. After his conviction, Ferguson was put in the position to argue in appellate briefs that he had incompetent counsel (himself).People v. Ferguson (1998) 248 App.Div.2d 725, 670 N.Y.S.2d 327. After his sentencing, Ferguson was incarcerated for a time at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York. As of 2019, he is serving his life sentence in the maximum security Upstate Correctional Facility, located in the northernmost part of the state. In 1994, Ferguson was apparently involved in a fistfight with fellow inmate Joel Rifkin. The brawl began when Ferguson asked Rifkin to be quiet while Ferguson was using the telephone. The New York Daily News reported the fight escalated after Ferguson told Rifkin, \\"I wiped out six devils, and you only killed women,\\" to which Rifkin responded; \\"yeah, but I had more victims.\\" Ferguson then punched Rifkin in the mouth. Aftermath=Lawsuits= Carolyn McCarthy, wife of victim Dennis McCarthy, was elected to the United States House of Representatives after running on a platform of gun control. upright Carolyn McCarthy ‚Äî whose husband Dennis McCarthy was killed by Ferguson, and whose son Kevin McCarthy was severely injured ‚Äî was subsequently elected to the United States Congress, on a platform of gun control. She was motivated to run for Congress after the representative in her district, Dan Frisa, voted against an assault weapons bill. Some of Ferguson's other victims and their family members have also become involved in gun control efforts. McCarthy also sued Olin Corporation, the parent of Winchester Ammunition under products liability and negligence theories for their manufacture of the Black Talon bullets used by Ferguson. The cartridges carry hollow-tipped bullets that expand upon impact, increasing the severity of wounds. One month before the LIRR shooting, Winchester Ammunition announced they were voluntarily withdrawing the Black Talon cartridges from the market. McCarthy's suit failed for numerous reasons, most notably because New York State law placed no responsibility on manufacturers for the criminal misuse of their products.McCarthy v. Olin Corp. 119 F.3d 148 (2nd Cir. 1997). At least a half- dozen lawsuits related to the shootings were filed against the Long Island Rail Road and its parent company, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Carolyn McCarthy filed a $36 million damage lawsuit against the two entities, claiming they failed to provide adequate protection for passengers and should have installed metal detectors and used undercover police officers. The suit sought $1 million for Dennis McCarthy's pain and suffering, $10 million for his death and for damages to survivors, and $25 million for injuries to Kevin McCarthy. =LIRR cars involved= The LIRR units in which the shootings happened, #9891 and #9892, a pair of standard M3 electric cars, were held out of service for potential use as evidence, then were renumbered to #9945 and #9946. This unit still sees regular service with these new numbers. The units were expected to be retired sometime between 2016 and 2019 after the LIRR completes an order of brand-new M9 railcars to replace the remaining M3s. =In media= Ferguson was the subject of a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch in which he, portrayed by Tim Meadows, declared \\"I did not shoot them, they shot me\\" and asked witnesses questions about shooting him while they were on the stand, then ducking when they pointed to him as the killer. During the 1993 summer excursion season, the LIRR presented a dinner theater mystery, Murder on the Montauk Express, on its premier Friday evening train to the resorts of the Hamptons and Montauk. The play was not renewed after the Ferguson murders. A 2002 book by trial consultant Mark C. Bardwell and criminal justice professor Bruce A. Arrigo examined the competency issues in the Ferguson case.

United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951), was a United States Supreme Court case relating to Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA. The Court ruled that Dennis did not have the right under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to exercise free speech, publication and assembly, if the exercise involved the creation of a plot to overthrow the government.. In 1969, Brandenburg v. Ohio de facto overruled Dennis. Background of the case In 1948, eleven Communist Party leaders were convicted of advocating the violent overthrow of the US government and for the violation of several points of the Smith Act. The party members who had been petitioning for socialist reforms claimed that the act violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and that they served no clear and present danger to the nation. The eleven petitioners were:Belknap (1994), p 211.Belknap (1977), p 51. Belknap (1994), p 207. Lannon, p 122. Morgan, p 314. * Benjamin J. Davis - Chairman of the CPUSA's Legislative Committee * Eugene Dennis - General Secretary * John Gates - Leader of the Young Communist League * Gil Green - Member of the National Board * Gus Hall - Member of the National Board * Irving Potash ‚Äì Furriers Union official * Jack Stachel * Robert G. Thompson - Lead of the New York organization * John Williamson - Member of the Central Committee * Henry Winston - Member of the National Board * Carl Winter - Lead of the Michigan organization The 1949 trial was presided over by Judge Harold Medina, a former Columbia University professor who had been a judge for only 18 months when the trial began.Morgan, p 314. Sabin, p 41. The trial was held in the Foley Square federal courthouse in New York City, and opened on November 1, 1948; preliminary proceedings and jury selection lasted until January 17, 1949; the defendants first appeared in court on March 7; and the trial concluded on October 14, 1949.Morgan, p 315. Although later trials surpassed it, in 1949 it was the longest federal trial in US history.Longer trials have been held since then, for example a 20-month trial in 1988. Prosecutor John McGohey did not assert that the defendants had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments.Belknap (1994), p 214. To prove this, the prosecution proffered articles, pamphlets and books (such as The Communist Manifesto) written by authors such as Karl Marx.Belknap (1994), p 214. Belknap (1994), p 209. The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were also personally guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.Belknap (1994), p 209. The five attorneys who volunteered to defend the communists were familiar with leftist causes and personally supported the defendants' rights to espouse communist views. They were Abraham Isserman, George W. Crockett, Jr., Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe.Sabin, p 42. Attorney Maurice Sugar participated in an advisory role.\\"Communist Trial Ends with 11 Guilty\\", Life, October 24, 1949, p 31. Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself. The ACLU was dominated by anti-communist leaders during the 1940s, and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act. However, the ACLU did provide an amicus brief for the Foley Square defendants, endorsing a motion for dismissal.Walker, pp 185-187\\\\. However, many local affiliates of the ACLU supported communist defendants. The defense employed a three-pronged strategy: First, portraying the CPUSA as a conventional political party, which promoted socialism by peaceful means; second, employing the \\"labor defense\\" tactic to attack the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome to proletarian defendants; and third, using the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies.Walker, p 185. Belknap (1994), p 217. Sabin, pp 44-46. The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions, which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina.Redish, p 82. Sabin, p 46. Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of \\"mutual hostility\\" arose between the judge and attorneys.Sabin, p 46. Medina came to believe that the defense attorneys were using the trial as an opportunity to publicize communist propaganda, and that they deliberately disrupted the trial using any means they could.Redish, p 82. Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing defendants who were out of order. In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts. Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.Martelle, p 190. On October 14, 1949, after the defense rested their case, the judge gave the jury instructions to guide them in reaching a verdict. After deliberating for seven and a half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants.Belknap (1994), p 221. The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine each. =Appeal= Petitioners were found guilty by the trial court and the decision was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court granted writ of certiorari, but limited it to whether section two or three of the Smith Act violated the First Amendment and whether the same two sections violated the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness. George W. Crockett, Jr., Abraham J. Isserman and Harry Sacher argued the cause for petitioners. With them on the brief was Richard Gladstein. Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman and Irving S. Shapiro argued the cause for the United States. With them on the brief were U.S. Attorney General James Howard McGrath, U.S. Assistant Attorney General McInerney, Irving H. Saypol, Robert W. Ginnane, Frank H. Gordon, Edward C. Wallace, and Lawrence K. Bailey. The court's decision Handed down as a 6-2 decision by the Court on June 4, 1951, the judgment and a plurality opinion was delivered by Chief Justice of the United States Fred M. Vinson, who was joined by Justices Stanley Forman Reed, Sherman Minton, and Harold H. Burton. Separate concurring opinions were delivered by Justices Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson. Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas wrote separate dissenting opinions. Justice Tom C. Clark did not participate in this case. The Court rule affirmed the conviction of the petitioner, a leader of the Communist Party in the United States. Dennis had been convicted of conspiring and organizing for the overthrow and destruction of the United States government by force and violence under provisions of the Smith Act. In affirming the conviction, a plurality of the Court adopted Judge Learned Hand's formulation of the clear and probable danger test, an adaptation of the clear and present danger test: > In each case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the \\"evil\\", discounted > by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary to > avoid the danger. In his dissent, Black wrote: > These petitioners were not charged with an attempt to overthrow the > Government. They were not charged with overt acts of any kind designed to > overthrow the Government. They were not even charged with saying anything or > writing anything designed to overthrow the Government. The charge was that > they agreed to assemble and to talk and publish certain ideas at a later > date: The indictment is that they conspired to organize the Communist Party > and to use speech or newspapers and other publications in the future to > teach and advocate the forcible overthrow of the Government. No matter how > it is worded, this is a virulent form of prior censorship of speech and > press, which I believe the First Amendment forbids. I would hold 3 of the > Smith Act authorizing this prior restraint unconstitutional on its face and > as applied.... > So long as this Court exercises the power of judicial review of legislation, > I cannot agree that the First Amendment permits us to sustain laws > suppressing freedom of speech and press on the basis of Congress' or our own > notions of mere \\"reasonableness.\\" Such a doctrine waters down the First > Amendment so that it amounts to little more than an admonition to Congress. > The Amendment as so construed is not likely to protect any but those \\"safe\\" > or orthodox views which rarely need its protection.... > There is hope, however, that in calmer times, when present pressures, > passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First > Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free > society. Aftermath In 1957, the Court in Yates v. United States restricted the holding in Dennis, ruling that the Smith Act did not prohibit advocacy of forcible overthrow of the government as an abstract doctrine. While Yates did not overrule Dennis, it rendered the broad conspiracy provisions of the Smith Act unenforceable. Finally, in 1969, Brandenburg v. Ohio held that \\"mere advocacy\\" of violence was per se protected speech. Brandenburg was a de facto overruling of Dennis, defining the bar for constitutionally unprotected speech to be incitement to \\"imminent lawless action\\".

Alternative terms include counselor (or counsellor-at-law) and lawyer.Merriam-Webster Online As of April 2011, there were 1,225,452 licensed attorneys in the United States. A 2012 survey conducted by LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell determined 58 million consumers in the U.S. sought an attorney in the last year and that 76 percent of consumers used the Internet to search for an attorney. The United States legal system does not draw a distinction between lawyers who plead in court and those who do not, unlike many other common law jurisdictions. For example, jurisdictions in the United Kingdom distinguish between solicitors who do not plead in court, and the barristers of the English and Welsh systems and advocates of the Scottish system, who do plead in court. Likewise, civil law jurisdictions distinguish between advocates and civil law notaries. An additional factor that differentiates the American legal system from other countries is that there is no delegation of routine work to notaries public. Attorneys may be addressed by the post-nominal letters Esq., the abbreviated form of the word Esquire. Specialization Many American attorneys limit their practices to specialized fields of law. Often distinctions are drawn between different types of attorneys, but, with the exception of patent law practice, these are neither fixed nor formal lines. Examples include: * Outside counsel (law firms) v. in-house counsel (corporate legal department) * Plaintiff v. defense attorneys (some attorneys do both plaintiff and defense work, others only handle certain types of cases like personal injury, business etc.) * Transactional (or \\"office practice\\") attorneys (who negotiate and draft documents and advise clients, rarely going to court) v. litigators (who advise clients in the context of legal disputes both in and out of court, including lawsuits, arbitrations and negotiated settlements) * Trial attorneys (who argue the facts, such as the late Johnnie Cochran) v. appellate attorneys (who argue the law, such as David Boies) Despite these descriptions, some states forbid or discourage claims of specialization in particular areas of law unless the attorney has been certified by his or her state bar or state board of legal specialization. Some states grant formal certifications recognizing specialties. In California, for example, bar certification is offered in family law, appellate practice, criminal law, bankruptcy, estate planning, immigration, taxation and workers' compensation. Any attorney meeting the bar requirements in one of these fields may represent himself as a specialist. The State Bar of Texas, for example, formally grants certification of specialization in 21 select areas of law.Texas Board of Legal Specialization (TBLS) The majority of lawyers practicing in a particular field may typically not be certified as specialists in that field (and state board certification is not generally required to practice law in any field). For example, the State Bar of Texas (as of mid-2006) reported 77,056 persons licensed as attorneys in that state (excluding inactive members of the Bar),See factsheet entitled \\"State Bar of Texas Facts,\\" from texasbar.com. while the Texas Board of Legal Specialization reported, at about the same time, only 8,303 Texas attorneys who were board certified in any specialty. Indeed, of the 8,303 certified specialists in Texas, the highest number of attorneys certified in one specific field at that time was 1,775 (in personal injury trial law). Specialization in patent law is administered by the Office of Enrollment and Discipline of the US Patent and Trademark Office, which imposes stringent requirements for applicants to become registered as patent attorneys or patent agents. Training and accreditation In the United States, the practice of law is conditioned upon admission to practice of law, and specifically admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction. Regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary. Arguing cases in the federal courts requires separate admission. =Bar examinations= Each US state and similar jurisdiction (e.g. territories under federal control) sets its own rules for bar admission (or privilege to practice law), which can lead to different admission standards among states. In most cases, a person who is \\"admitted\\" to the bar is thereby a \\"member\\" of the particular bar. In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states. In 1763, Delaware created the first bar exam with other American colonies soon following suit.California Bar Background information, accessed April 21, 2009 The bar examination in most U.S. states and territories is at least two days long (a few states have three-day exams).William Burnham, Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States, 4th ed. (St. Paul: Thomson West, 2006), 135. It consists of essay questions, usually testing knowledge of the state's own law (usually subjects such as wills, trusts and community property, which always vary from one state to another). Some jurisdictions choose to use the Multistate Essay Examination (MEE), drafted by the NCBE since 1988, for this purpose. Others may draft their own questions with this goal in mind, while some states both draft their own questions and use the MEE. Some jurisdictions administer complicated questions that specifically test knowledge of that state's law. Bar exams also usually consist of the Multistate Bar Examination, which is a multiple-choice standardized test created and sold to participating state bar examiners by the National Conference of Bar Examiners since 1972.Bar Admissions background, PDF The MBE contains 200 questions which test six subjects based upon principles of common law and Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The State of Washington has a separate Law Clerk program under Rule Six of the Washington Court Admission to Practice Rules.Washington Courts: APR Rule 6, Law Clerk Program A college graduate of good moral character may be accepted into the four-year Rule Six Law Clerk Program, obtain employment in a law firm or with a judge for at least 30 hours a week and study a prescribed Course of Study under a tutor. After successful completion of the program, a law clerk may take the Washington State Bar Exam and, upon passing, will be admitted as an attorney into the Washington State Bar Association. =Degrees in law= The degree earned by prospective attorneys in the United States is generally a Juris Doctor (Latin for \\"Doctor of Jurisprudence\\"; abbreviated J.D. or, when conferred in English, D.Jur.). This is different from countries based on a British law system, where law is taught at the undergraduate level, resulting in a Bachelor of Laws being awarded. The Doctor of Laws exists in the United States as an honorary degree. The highest law degrees obtainable in the United States are Doctor of Juridical Science (Scientiae Juridicae Doctor, abbreviated S.J.D. or J.S.D.). The S.J.D. is akin to an academic degree that, like the Ph.D., is research-based and requires a dissertation (an original contribution to the academic study of law). The LL.M. is generally earned by completing studies in a particular area of law. LL.M. is an abbreviation of the Latin Legum Magister, which means Master of Laws. For example, most accredited law schools in the United States require basic coursework in Federal Taxation. After earning a J.D., an attorney may seek admission to an LL.M. program in taxation. Earning the LL.M. requires completion of coursework in the area of tax law. There is no requirement for attorneys to complete an LL.M. program to practice law in the United States, and relatively few attorneys hold an LL.M. In the U.S., for example, some states allow foreign lawyers to seek admission to the bar upon completion of an LL.M., while in other states, a J.D. is required. The LL.M. degree is viewed with great skepticism by many U.S. educated lawyers as a relatively easy means for foreign lawyers to gain access to bar admission in certain states without the rigorous training in core subjects taught during the first and second years of U.S. law schools. =Law students in court= Some courts allow law students to act as \\"certified student attorneys\\" after the satisfactory completion of their first year of law school and the completion of particular second- and third-year courses with subjects such as evidence. Many states allow students to argue in front of a court as a certified legal intern (CLI), provided they meet certain prerequisites, such as having completed at least half of their law education, having taken or be taking the law school's ethics class and being under the supervision of a qualified and licensed attorney. Unlicensed practice of law Some states provide criminal penalties for falsely holding oneself out to the public as an attorney at law and the unauthorized practice of law by a non-attorney. A person who has a professional law degree, but is not admitted to a state bar is not an attorney at law or lawyer since he or she does not hold a license issued by a state. A few areas of law, such as patent law, bankruptcy, or immigration law, are mandated by the U.S. Constitution to be strictly under federal jurisdiction. In this case, state courts and bar associations are not allowed to restrict the practice of that field of law.

More specifically, folk mathematics, or mathematical folklore, is the body of theorems, definitions, proofs, facts or techniques that circulate among mathematicians by word of mouth, but have not yet appeared in print, either in books or in scholarly journals. Knowledge of folklore is the coin of the realm of academic mathematics. Quite important at times for researchers are folk theorems, which are results known, at least to experts in a field, and are considered to have established status, though not published in complete form.

Cassels (1976) \\"An embedding theorem for fields: Addendem\\", Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 14: 479‚Äì80 These mathematical matters are known and factual, but not in active circulation in relation with current research (i.e., untrendy). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the actual context in which research work is done. Some people, in particular non- mathematicians, use the term folk mathematics to refer to the informal mathematics studied in many ethno-cultural studies of mathematics. Although the term \\"mathematical folklore\\" can also be used within the mathematics circle to describe the various aspects of their esoteric culture and practices (e.g., slang, proverb, limerick, joke). Stories, sayings and jokes Mathematical folklore can also refer to the unusual (and possibly apocryphal) stories or jokes involving mathematicians or mathematics that are told verbally in mathematics departments. Compilations include tales collected in G. H. Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology and ; examples include: *Galileo dropping weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. *An apple falling on Isaac Newton's head to inspire his theory of gravitation. *The drinking, duel and early death of Galois. *Richard Feynman cracking safes in the Manhattan Project. *Alfr√©d R√©nyi's definition of a mathematician: \\"a device for turning coffee into theorems\\". *P√°l Tur√°n's suggestion that weak coffee was only suitable for lemma. *The \\"turtles all the way down\\" story told by Stephen Hawking. *Fermat's lost simple proof. *The unwieldy proof and associated controversies of the Four Color Theorem.

In the field of artificial intelligence the study of na√Øve physics is a part of the effort to formalize the common knowledge of human beings. Many ideas of folk physics are simplifications, misunderstandings, or misperceptions of well-understood phenomena, incapable of giving useful predictions of detailed experiments, or simply are contradicted by more thorough observations. They may sometimes be true, be true in certain limited cases, be true as a good first approximation to a more complex effect, or predict the same effect but misunderstand the underlying mechanism. Na√Øve physics can also be defined as an intuitive understanding all humans have about objects in the physical world. Cognitive psychologists are delving deeper into these phenomena with promising results. Psychological studies indicate that certain notions of the physical world are innate in all of us. Examples Some examples of na√Øve physics include commonly understood, intuitive, or everyday-observed rules of nature: * What goes up must come down * A dropped object falls straight down * A solid object cannot pass through another solid object * A vacuum sucks things towards it * An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense * Two events are either simultaneous or they are not Many of these and similar ideas formed the basis for the first works in formulating and systematizing physics by Aristotle and the medieval scholastics in Western civilization. In the modern science of physics, they were gradually contradicted by the work of Galileo, Newton, and others. The idea of absolute simultaneity survived until 1905, when the special theory of relativity and its supporting experiments discredited it. Psychological research The increasing sophistication of technology makes possible more research on knowledge acquisition. Researchers measure physiological responses (like heart rate or eye movement) to quantify reaction to a particular stimulus. Concrete physiological data is helpful when observing infant behavior, because infants cannot use words to explain things (such as their reactions) the way most adults or older children can. Research in na√Øve physics relies on technology to measure eye gaze and reaction time in particular. Through observation, researchers know that infants get bored looking at the same stimulus after a certain amount of time. That boredom is called habituation. When an infant is sufficiently habituated to a stimulus, he or she will typically look away, alerting the experimenter to his or her boredom. At this point, the experimenter will introduce another stimulus. The infant will then dishabituate by attending to the new stimulus. In each case, the experimenter measures the time it takes for the infant to habituate to each stimulus. Researchers infer that the longer the infant takes to habituate to a new stimulus, the more it violates his or her expectations of physical phenomena. When an adult observes an optical illusion that seems physically impossible, he or she will attend to it until it makes sense. Until recently, psychologists believed that our understanding of physical laws emerges strictly from experience. But research shows that infants, who do not yet have such expansive knowledge of the world, have the same extended reaction to events that defy what is physically possible. Such studies conclude that all people are born with an innate ability to understand the physical world. Smith and Cassati (1994) have reviewed the early history of na√Øve physics, and especially the role of the Italian psychologist Paolo Bozzi. =Types of experiments= The basic experimental procedure of a study on na√Øve physics involves three steps: prediction of the infant's expectation, violation of that expectation, and measurement of the results. As mentioned above, the physically impossible event holds the infant's attention longer, indicating surprise when expectations are violated. Solidity An experiment that tests an infant's knowledge of solidity involves the impossible event of one solid object passing through another. First, the infant is shown a flat, solid square moving from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞ in an arch formation. Next, a solid block is placed in the path of the screen, preventing it from completing its full range of motion. The infant habituates to this event, as it is what anyone would expect. Then, the experimenter creates the impossible event, and the solid screen passes through the solid block. The infant is confused by the event and attends longer than in probable event trial. Occlusion An occlusion event tests the knowledge that an object exists even if it is not immediately visible. Jean Piaget originally called this concept object permanence. When Piaget formed his developmental theory in the 1950s, he claimed that object permanence is learned, not innate. The children's game peek-a-boo is a classic example of this phenomenon, and one which obscures the true grasp infants have on permanence. To disprove this notion, an experimenter designs an impossible occlusion event. The infant is shown a block and a transparent screen. The infant habituates, then a solid panel is placed in front of the objects to block them from view. When the panel is removed, the block is gone, but the screen remains. The infant is confused because the block has disappeared indicating that he/she understands that objects maintain location in space and do not simply disappear. Containment A containment event tests the infant's recognition that an object that is bigger than a container cannot fit completely into that container. Elizabeth Spelke, one of the psychologists who founded the na√Øve physics movement, identified the continuity principle, which conveys an understanding that objects exist continuously in time and space. Both occlusion and containment experiments hinge on the continuity principle. In the experiment, the infant is shown a tall cylinder and a tall cylindrical container. The experimenter demonstrates that the tall cylinder fits into the tall container, and the infant is bored by the expected physical outcome. The experimenter then places the tall cylinder completely into a much shorter cylindrical container, and the impossible event confuses the infant. Extended attention demonstrates the infant's understanding that containers cannot hold objects that exceed them in height. =Baillargeon's research= The published findings of Renee Baillargeon brought innate knowledge to the forefront in psychological research. Her research method centered on the visual preference technique. Baillargeon and her followers studied how infants show preference to one stimulus over another. Experimenters judge preference by the length of time an infant will stare at a stimulus before habituating. Researchers believe that preference indicates the infant's ability to discriminate between the two events.

The effects of cannabis are caused by chemical compounds in the cannabis plant, including 400 different cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), allow its drug to have various psychological and physiological effects on the human body. Different plants of the genus Cannabis contain different and often unpredictable concentrations of THC and other cannabinoids and hundreds of other molecules that have a pharmacological effect, so that the final net effect cannot reliably be foreseen. Acute effects while under the influence can include euphoria and anxiety. Although some assert that cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, may alleviate the adverse effects of THC that some users experience, little is known about CBD's effects on humans. The well-controlled studies with humans have a hard time showing that CBD can be distinguished from a placebo or that it has any systematic effect on the adverse effects of cannabis. When ingested orally, THC can produce stronger psychotropic effects than when inhaled. At doses exceeding the psychotropic threshold, users may experience adverse side effects such as anxiety and panic attacks that can result in increased heart rate and changes in blood pressure. In the United States research about medical cannabis has been hindered by federal law. Smoking any substance could possibly carry similar risks as smoking tobacco due to carcinogens in all smoke, and the ultimate conclusions on these factors are disputed. Cannabis use disorder is defined as a medical diagnosis in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).Grohol, John M..

Tetrahydrocannabivarin. Cannabidiol. Cannabinol. Cannabivarin. Cannabidivarin. =Cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors= The most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids, particularly THC. Some varieties, having undergone careful selection and growing techniques, can yield as much as 34% THC. Another psychoactive cannabinoid present in Cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist. There are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality: cannabidiol (CBD), an isomer of THC; cannabivarin (CBV), an analog of cannabinol (CBN) with a different side chain, cannabidivarin (CBDV), an analog of CBD with a different side chain, and cannabinolic acid. How these other compounds interact with THC is not fully understood. Some clinical studies have proposed that CBD acts as a balancing agent to regulate the strength of the psychoactive agent THC. CBD is believed to regulate the metabolism of THC by inactivating cytochrome P450, an important class of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Experiments in which babies were treated with CBD followed by THC showed that CBD was associated with a substantial increase in brain concentrations of THC and its major metabolites, most likely because it decreased the rate of clearance of THC from the body. Cannabis cofactors have also been linked to lowering body temperature, modulating immune function, and cell protection. The essential oil of cannabis contains many fragrant terpenoids which may synergize with the cannabinoids to produce their unique effects. THC is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also pharmacologically active, so the euphoria outlasts measurable THC levels in blood. THC and cannabidiol are neuroprotective antioxidants. Research on rats has demonstrated that THC prevents hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage as well as or better than other antioxidants in a chemical (Fenton reaction) system and neuronal cultures. Cannabidiol was significantly more protective than either vitamin E or vitamin C. The cannabinoid receptor is a typical G protein-coupled receptor. A characteristic of this type of receptor is the distinct pattern of how the molecule spans the cell membrane seven times. Cannabinoid receptors are located on the cell membrane, and both outside (extracellularly) and inside (intracellularly) the cell membrane. CB1 receptors, the bigger of the two, are extraordinarily abundant in the brain: 10 times more plentiful than the Œº-opioid receptors responsible for the effects of morphine. CB2 receptors are structurally different (the sequence similarity between the two subtypes of receptors is 44%), found only on cells of the immune system, and seems to function similarly to its CB1 counterpart. CB2 receptors are most prevalent on B-cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes, but can also be found on polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells, T8 cells, and T4 cells. In the tonsils the CB2 receptors appear to be restricted to B-lymphocyte-enriched areas. =Biochemical mechanisms in the brain= Cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring, a variedly derivatized aromatic ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors, constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds. Like most other neurological processes, the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction, the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response. It is now understood that cannabinoid receptors appear in similar forms in most vertebrates and invertebrates and have a long evolutionary history of 500 million years. The binding of cannabinoids to cannabinoid receptors decrease adenylyl cyclase activity, inhibit calcium N channels, and disinhibit K+A channels. There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). The CB1 receptor is found primarily in the brain and mediates the psychological effects of THC. The CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system. Cannabinoids act as immunomodulators at CB2 receptors, meaning they increase some immune responses and decrease others. For example, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids can be used as a very effective anti-inflammatory. The affinity of cannabinoids to bind to either receptor is about the same, with only a slight increase observed with the plant-derived compound CBD binding to CB2 receptors more frequently. Cannabinoids likely have a role in the brain's control of movement and memory, as well as natural pain modulation. It is clear that cannabinoids can affect pain transmission and, specifically, that cannabinoids interact with the brain's endogenous opioid system and may affect dopamine transmission. =Sustainability in the body= Most cannabinoids are lipophilic (fat soluble) compounds that are easily stored in fat, thus yielding a long elimination half-life relative to other recreational drugs. The THC molecule, and related compounds, are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to Redwood Laboratories; long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use (see drug test). Toxicities=Related to cannabinoids= No fatal overdoses with cannabis use have been reported. A review published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in February 2001 said that \\"no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported\\". (Deaths by indirect means, such as dehydration from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), have been reported.\\"It's honestly hell.\\" Hospitals see rare vomiting syndrome in heavy marijuana consumers) THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death. In dogs, the minimum lethal dose of THC is over 3 g/kg. According to the Merck Index,1996\\\\. The Merck Index, 12th ed., Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey the of THC (the dose which causes the death of 50% of individuals) is 1270 mg/kg for male rats and 730 mg/kg for female rats from oral consumption in sesame oil, and 42 mg/kg for rats from inhalation. It is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs, especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes CYP450,Cannabinoids and Cytochrome P450 Interactions.

A Review thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking. =Related to smoking= A 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar, cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides, but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study found that directly inhaled cannabis smoke contained as much as 20 times as much ammonia and 5 times as much hydrogen cyanide as tobacco smoke and compared the properties of both mainstream and sidestream (smoke emitted from a smouldering 'joint' or 'cone') smoke. Mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than sidestream tobacco smoke. However, other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco, and that some other constituents (such as polonium-210, lead, arsenic, nicotine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines) are either lower or non- existent in cannabis smoke. Cannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic chemical compounds. This tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke or cigars. Over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke. These include nitrosamines, reactive aldehydes, and polycylic hydrocarbons, including benz[a]pyrene. Marijuana smoke was listed as a cancer agent in California in 2009. A study by the British Lung Foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users. Other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco. Professor David Nutt, a UK drug expert, points out that the study cited by the British Lung Foundation has been accused of both \\"false reasoning\\" and \\"incorrect methodology\\". Further, he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer, and accuses the BLF of \\"scaremongering over cannabis\\". Short-term effects Difference between natural cannabinoids and THC A) THC B) CB-1 receptor C) Neurotransmitters D) Postsynaptic Receptors E) Cannabinoid. When smoked, the short-term effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent within a few minutes, typically lasting for 1‚Äì3 hours, varying by the person and the strain of cannabis. After oral ingestion of cannabis, the onset of effect is delayed relative to smoking, taking 30 minutes to 2 hours, but the duration is prolonged due to continued slow absorption. The duration of noticeable effects has been observed to diminish after prolonged, repeated use and the development of increased tolerance to cannabinoids. =Psychological effects= A man smoking cannabis in Kolkata, India. The psychoactive effects of cannabis, known as a \\"high\\", are subjective and vary among persons and the method of use. When THC enters the blood stream and reaches the brain, it binds to cannabinoid receptors. The endogenous ligand of these receptors is anandamide, the effects of which THC emulates. This agonism of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and norepinephrine; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion, such as euphoria and anxiety. Some effects may include a general alteration of conscious perception, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation or stress reduction, increased appreciation of the arts, including humor and music (especially discerning its various components/instruments), joviality, metacognition and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is the most commonly reported negative side effect of smoking marijuana. Between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis; however, some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. Cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of THC, including anxiety, that some consumers experience. Cannabis produces many other subjective effects, including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma, and marked distortions in the perception of time (where experiencing a \\"rush\\" of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing). At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory and/or visual illusions, pseudohallucinations, and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to acute psychosis and dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization. Any episode of acute psychosis that accompanies cannabis use usually abates after six hours, but in rare instances, heavy users may find the symptoms continuing for many days. If the episode is accompanied by aggression or sedation, physical restraint may be necessary. While psychoactive drugs are typically categorized as stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogen, cannabis exhibits a mix of all of them, perhaps leaning more towards hallucinogenic or psychedelic properties, though with other effects quite pronounced. THC is considered the primary active component of the cannabis plant. Scientific studies have suggested that other cannabinoids like CBD may also play a significant role in its psychoactive effects. =Somatic effects= Bloodshot eye. Some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate, dry mouth, reddening of the eyes (congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels), a reduction in intra- ocular pressure, muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face. Electroencephalography or EEG shows somewhat more persistent alpha waves of slightly lower frequency than usual. Cannabinoids produce a \\"marked depression of motor activity\\" via activation of neuronal cannabinoid receptors belonging to the CB1 subtype. =Duration= Peak levels of cannabis-associated intoxication occur approximately 30 minutes after smoking it and last for several hours. Smoked The total short-term duration of cannabis use when smoked depends on the potency, method of smoking ‚Äì e.g. whether pure or in conjunction with tobacco ‚Äì and how much is smoked. Peak levels of intoxication typically last an average of three to four hours. Oral When taken orally (in the form of capsules, food, or drink), the psychoactive effects take longer to manifest and generally last longer, typically lasting for an average of four to six hours after consumption. Oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore negates the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking. =Neurological effects= The areas of the brain where cannabinoid receptors are most prevalent are consistent with the behavioral effects produced by cannabinoids. Brain regions in which cannabinoid receptors are very abundant are the basal ganglia, associated with movement control; the cerebellum, associated with body movement coordination; the hippocampus, associated with learning, memory, and stress control; the cerebral cortex, associated with higher cognitive functions; and the nucleus accumbens, regarded as the reward center of the brain. Other regions where cannabinoid receptors are moderately concentrated are the hypothalamus, which regulates homeostatic functions; the amygdala, associated with emotional responses and fears; the spinal cord, associated with peripheral sensations like pain; the brain stem, associated with sleep, arousal, and motor control; and the nucleus of the solitary tract, associated with visceral sensations like nausea and vomiting. Experiments on animal and human tissue have demonstrated a disruption of short-term memory formation, which is consistent with the abundance of C receptors on the hippocampus, the region of the brain most closely associated with memory. Cannabinoids inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters in the hippocampus such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and glutamate, resulting in a decrease in neuronal activity in that area. In in-vitro experiments THC at extremely high concentrations, which could not be reached with commonly consumed doses, caused competitive inhibition of the AChE enzyme and inhibition of Œ≤-amyloid peptide aggregation, implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A aggregation, and this study provides a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may impact the progression of this debilitating disease. =Effects on driving= While several studies have shown increased risk associated with cannabis use by drivers, other studies have not found increased risk. Cannabis usage has been shown in some studies to have a negative effect on driving ability. The British Medical Journal indicated that \\"drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol\\". In Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary, the United Kingdom's Department for Transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving, finding although impaired, \\"subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired. Where they can compensate, they do...\\". In a review of driving simulator studies, researchers note that \\"even in those who learn to compensate for a drug's impairing effects, substantial impairment in performance can still be observed under conditions of general task performance (i.e. when no contingencies are present to maintain compensated performance).\\" A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash. An extensive 2013 review of 66 studies regarding crash risk and drug use found that cannabis was associated with minor, but not statistically significant increased odds of injury or fatal accident. In the largest and most precisely controlled study of its kind carried out by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it was found that other \\"studies that measure the presence of THC in the drivers' blood or oral fluid, rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates. Likewise better controlled studies have found lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates\\". The study found that \\"after adjusting for age, gender, race and alcohol use, drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving\\". On the other hand, a recent study of Journal of Transport & Health indicated that the numbers of fatal crashes involving marijuana after the recreational marijuana legalization or decriminalization have significantly increased in Colorado, Washington, and Massachusetts. =Cardiovascular effects= Short-term (one to two hours) effects on the cardiovascular system can include increased heart rate, dilation of blood vessels, and fluctuations in blood pressure. There are medical reports of occasional heart attacks or myocardial infarction, stroke and other cardiovascular side effects. Marijuana's cardiovascular effects are not associated with serious health problems for most young, healthy users. Researchers reported in the International Journal of Cardiology, \\"Marijuana use by older people, particularly those with some degree of coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease, poses greater risks due to the resulting increase in catecholamines, cardiac workload, and carboxyhemoglobin levels, and concurrent episodes of profound postural hypotension. Indeed, marijuana may be a much more common cause of myocardial infarction than is generally recognized. In day-to-day practice, a history of marijuana use is often not sought by many practitioners, and even when sought, the patient's response is not always truthful\\". A 2013 analysis of 3,886 myocardial infarction survivors over an 18-year period showed \\"no statistically significant association between marijuana use and mortality\\". A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. A 2000 study by researchers at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health found that a middle age person's risk of heart attack rises nearly fivefold in the first hour after smoking marijuana, \\"roughly the same risk seen within an hour of sexual activity\\". Cannabis arteritis is a very rare peripheral vascular disease similar to Buerger's disease. There were about 50 confirmed cases from 1960 to 2008, all of which occurred in Europe. =Combination with other drugs= A confounding factor in cannabis research is the prevalent usage of other recreational drugs, especially alcohol and nicotine. Such complications demonstrate the need for studies on cannabis that have stronger controls, and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco. Some critics question whether agencies doing the research make an honest effort to present an accurate, unbiased summary of the evidence, or whether they \\"cherry-pick\\" their data to please funding sources which may include the tobacco industry or governments dependent on cigarette tax revenue; others caution that the raw data, and not the final conclusions, are what should be examined. The Australian National Household Survey of 2001 AIHW cat no. PHE 41. showed that cannabis in Australia is rarely used without other drugs. 95% of cannabis users also drank alcohol; 26% took amphetamines; 19% took ecstasy and only 2.7% reported not having used any other drug with cannabis. AIHW cat no. PHE 35. While research has been undertaken on the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis on performing certain tasks, little research has been conducted on the reasons why this combination is so popular. Evidence from a controlled experimental study undertaken by Lukas and Orozco suggests that alcohol causes THC to be absorbed more rapidly into the blood plasma of the user. Data from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that three- quarters of recent cannabis users reported using alcohol when cannabis was not available, this suggests that the two are substitutes. =Memory and learning= Studies on cannabis and memory are hindered by small sample sizes, confounding drug use, and other factors. The strongest evidence regarding cannabis and memory focuses on its temporary negative effects on short-term and working memory. In a 2001 study looking at neuropsychological performance in long-term cannabis users, researchers found \\"some cognitive deficits appear detectable at least 7 days after heavy cannabis use but appear reversible and related to recent cannabis exposure rather than irreversible and related to cumulative lifetime use\\". On his studies regarding cannabis use, lead researcher and Harvard professor Harrison Pope said he found marijuana is not dangerous over the long term, but there are short-term effects. From neuropsychological tests, Pope found that chronic cannabis users showed difficulties, with verbal memory in particular, for \\"at least a week or two\\" after they stopped smoking. Within 28 days, memory problems vanished and the subjects \\"were no longer distinguishable from the comparison group\\".Lyons, Casey (October 2012) Lost in the Weeds: Legalizing Medical Marijuana in Massachusetts. Boston Magazine. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine failed to show substantial, systemic neurological effects from long-term recreational use of cannabis. Their findings were published in the July 2003 issue of the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society.Minimal Long-Term Effects of Marijuana Use Found. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society (June 27, 2003) The research team, headed by Dr Igor Grant, found that cannabis use did affect perception, but did not cause permanent brain damage. Researchers looked at data from 15 previously published controlled studies involving 704 long-term cannabis users and 484 nonusers. The results showed long-term cannabis use was only marginally harmful on the memory and learning. Other functions such as reaction time, attention, language, reasoning ability, perceptual and motor skills were unaffected. The observed effects on memory and learning, they said, showed long-term cannabis use caused \\"selective memory defects\\", but that the impact was \\"of a very small magnitude\\".Beasley, Deena (27 June 2003) Study ‚Äì Pot doesn't cause permanent brain damage. Reuters Health E-Line A study at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine showed that very heavy use of marijuana is associated with decrements in neurocognitive performance even after 28 days of abstinence. =Appetite= The feeling of increased appetite following the use of cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years, and is known colloquially as \\"the munchies\\" in the English-speaking world. Clinical studies and survey data have found that cannabis increases food enjoyment and interest in food.Bonsor, Kevin. \\"How Marijauan Works: Other Physiological Effects\\". HowStuffWorks. Retrieved on 2007-11-03 A 2015 study suggests that cannabis triggers uncharacteristic behaviour in POMC neurons, which are usually associated with decreasing hunger. Rarely, chronic users experience a severe vomiting disorder, CHS, after smoking and find relief by taking hot baths. Endogenous cannabinoids (\\"endocannabinoids\\") were discovered in cow's milk and soft cheeses. Endocannabinoids are also found in human breast milk.The Endocannabinoid-CB Receptor System: Importance for development and in pediatric disease Neuroendocrinology Letters Nos.1/2, Feb-Apr Vol.25, 2004.Cannabinoids and Feeding: The Role of the Endogenous Cannabinoid System as a Trigger for Newborn Suckling Women and Cannabis: Medicine, Science, and Sociology, 2002 The Haworth Press, Inc. It is widely accepted that the neonatal survival of many species \\"is largely dependent upon their suckling behavior, or appetite for breast milk\\" and recent research has identified the endogenous cannabinoid system to be the first neural system to display complete control over milk ingestion and neonatal survival. It is possible that \\"cannabinoid receptors in our body interact with the cannabinoids in milk to stimulate a suckling response in newborns so as to prevent growth failure\\". =Pathogens and microtoxins= Most microorganisms found in cannabis only affect plants and not humans, but some microorganisms, especially those that proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored, can be harmful to humans. Some users may store marijuana in an airtight bag or jar in a refrigerator to prevent fungal and bacterial growth. Fungi Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungi Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus tamarii, Aspergillus sulphureus, Aspergillus repens, Mucor hiemalis (not a human pathogen), Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium italicum and Rhizopus nigrans have been found in moldy cannabis. Aspergillus mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or handling of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis. Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Researchers suggest that moldy cannabis should thus be discarded to avoid these serious risks. Mold is also found in smoke from mold- infected cannabis, and the lungs and nasal passages are a major means of contracting fungal infections. Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home ovens at 150 ¬∞C [302 ¬∞F], for five minutes before smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. niger, and did not degrade the active component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\\" Bacteria Cannabis contaminated with Salmonella muenchen was positively correlated with dozens of cases of salmonellosis in 1981. \\"Thermophilic actinomycetes\\" were also found in cannabis. Long-term effects Exposure to marijuana may have biologically-based physical, mental, behavioral, and social health consequences and is \\"associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis C), lungs, heart, eyesight, and vasculature\\" according to a 2013 literature review by Gordon and colleagues. The association with these diseases has only been reported in cases where people have smoked cannabis. The authors cautioned that \\"evidence is needed, and further research should be considered, to prove causal associations of marijuana with many physical health conditions\\". Cannabis use disorder is defined in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition requiring treatment. Several drugs have been investigated in an attempt to ameliorate the symptoms of stopping cannabis use. Such drugs include bupropion, divalproex, nefazodone, lofexidine, and dronabinol. Of these, dronabinol (a trade name for THC) has proven the most effective. Marijuana use can cause apathy and amotivational syndrome. Regular marijuana use may also cause anhedonia. A 2019 meta-analysis found that 34% of people with cannabis-induced psychosis transitioned to schizophrenia. This was found to be comparatively higher than hallucinogens (26%) and amphetamines (22%). Effects in pregnancy Cannabis consumption in pregnancy might be associated with restrictions in growth of the fetus, miscarriage, and cognitive deficits in offspring based on animal studies, although there is limited evidence for this in humans at this time. A 2012 systematic review found although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions, there was some evidence that prenatal exposure to cannabis was associated with \\"deficits in language, attention, areas of cognitive performance, and delinquent behavior in adolescence\\". A report prepared for the Australian National Council on Drugs concluded cannabis and other cannabinoids are contraindicated in pregnancy as it may interact with the endocannabinoid system.

It adopts elements of both consensus decision-making and majority rule. Deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic theory in that authentic deliberation, not mere voting, is the primary source of legitimacy for the law. While deliberative democracy is generally seen as some form of an amalgam of representative democracy and direct democracy, the actual relationship is usually open to dispute. Some practitioners and theorists use the term to encompass representative bodies whose members authentically and practically deliberate on legislation without unequal distributions of power, while others use the term exclusively to refer to decision-making directly by lay citizens, as in direct democracy. The term \\"deliberative democracy\\" was originally coined by Joseph M. Bessette in his 1980 work Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government. Overview Deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision- maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.http://www.sze.hu/~smuk/Nyilvanossag_torvenyek_CEE/Szakirodalom/Deliberat%C3%ADv%20demokr%C3%A1cia/deliberative%20democracy%20book.pdf#page=72Threlkeld, Simon. ‚ÄúA Blueprint for Democratic Law-making: Give Citizen Juries the Final Say.‚Äù Social Policy, Summer, 1998, pp 5-9 If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule. The roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to Aristotle and his notion of politics; however, the German philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas' work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area.For a brief overview of the roots and different streams of deliberative democracy, see Ercan, S.A. (2014) 'Deliberative democracy', in: D. Phillips (ed.), Encyclopedia of educational theory and philosophy. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, pp.214-216 http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book238016 Deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both representative democracies and direct democracies. Elster offers a summary of the various common definitions that academics use for the term. In elitist deliberative democracy, principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies, such as legislatures and courts; in populist deliberative democracy, principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions. One purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal. Another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy, where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a \\"public will\\" and directly creates binding law.Threlkeld, Simon. ‚ÄúA Blueprint for Democratic Law-making: Give Citizen Juries the Final Say.‚Äù Social Policy, Summer, 1998, pp 5-9. If political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives, then there is no democratic element; this deliberative process is called elite deliberation. According to Fishkin, this process attempts to indirectly filter the mass public opinion because representatives are better equipped with the knowledge of the common good than ordinary citizens. Characteristics=Fishkin's model of deliberation= James Fishkin, who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy for over 15 years in various countries, describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation: :*Information: The extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue :* Substantive balance: The extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives :* Diversity: The extent to which the major position in the public are represented by participants in the discussion :* Conscientiousness: The extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments :* Equal consideration: The extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them In Fishkin's definition of deliberative democracy, lay citizens must participate in the decision-making process, thus making it a subtype of direct democracy. James Fishkin and Robert Luskin suggest that deliberative discussion should be:Fishkin, J. S., & Luskin, R. C. (2005). Experimenting with a democratic ideal: Deliberative polling and public opinion. Acta Politica, 40(3), 284‚Äì298. # Informed (and thus informative). Arguments should be supported by appropriate and reasonably accurate factual claims. # Balanced. Arguments should be met by contrary arguments. # Conscientious. The participants should be willing to talk and listen, with civility and respect. # Substantive. Arguments should be considered sincerely on their merits, not on how they are made or by who is making them. # Comprehensive. All points of view held by significant portions of the population should receive attention. =Cohen's outline= Joshua Cohen, a student of John Rawls, outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy, in the article \\"Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy\\" in the 1989 book The Good Polity. He outlines five main features of deliberative democracy, which include: # An ongoing independent association with expected continuation. # The citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue. # A commitment to the respect of a pluralism of values and aims within the polity. # The citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy, and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process. # Each member recognizes and respects other members' deliberative capacity. This can be construed as the idea that in the legislative process, we \\"owe\\" one another reasons for our proposals. Cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy, and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving \\"ideal deliberation\\": # It is free in two ways: ## The participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation. They are free from any authority of prior norms or requirements. ## The participants suppose that they can act on the decision made; the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached. # Parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals, and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given, as the content of the very deliberation taking place. # Participants are equal in two ways: ## Formal: anyone can put forth proposals, criticize, and support measures. There is no substantive hierarchy. ## Substantive: The participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power, resources, or pre- existing norms. \\"The participants‚Ä¶do not regard themselves as bound by the existing system of rights, except insofar as that system establishes the framework of free deliberation among equals.\\" # Deliberation aims at a rationally motivated consensus: it aims to find reasons acceptable to all who are committed to such a system of decision-making. When consensus or something near enough is not possible, majoritarian decision making is used. In Democracy and Liberty, an essay published in 1998, Cohen reiterated many of these points, also emphasizing the concept of \\"reasonable pluralism\\" ‚Äì the acceptance of different, incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all. =Gutmann and Thompson's model= Amy Gutmann and Dennis F. Thompson's definition captures the elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy. They define it as \\"a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible, with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future\\".Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2004). Why Deliberative Democracy? pp. 3-7. They state that deliberative democracy has four requirements, which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another: # Reciprocal. The reasons should be acceptable to free and equal persons seeking fair terms of cooperation. # Accessible. The reasons must be given in public and the content must be understandable to the relevant audience. # Binding. The reason-giving process leads to a decision or law that is enforced for some period of time. The participants do not deliberate just for the sake of deliberation or for individual enlightenment. # Dynamic or Provisional. The participants must keep open the possibility of changing their minds, and continuing a reason-giving dialogue that can challenge previous decisions and laws. =Strengths and weaknesses= A claimed strength of deliberative democratic models is that they are more easily able to incorporate scientific opinion and base policy on outputs of ongoing research, because: *Time is given for all participants to understand and discuss the science *Scientific peer review, adversarial presentation of competing arguments, refereed journals, even betting markets, are also deliberative processes. *The technology used to record dissent and document opinions opposed to the majority is also useful to notarize bets, predictions and claims. According to proponents such as James Fearon, another strength of deliberative democratic models is that they tend, more than any other model, to generate ideal conditions of impartiality, rationality and knowledge of the relevant facts. The more these conditions are fulfilled, the greater the likelihood that the decisions reached are morally correct. Deliberative democracy takes on the role of an \\"epistemic democracy\\" in this way, as it thus has an epistemic value: it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct. This view has been prominently held by Carlos Nino. Studies by James Fishkin and others have found that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy.Susan C. Strokes in her critical essay Pathologies of Deliberation (Chapter 5 of Elster 1998) concedes there that a majority of academics interested agree with this view. Deliberative democracy produces less partisanship and more sympathy with opposing views; more respect for evidence- based reasoning rather than opinion; a greater commitment to the decisions taken by those involved; and a greater chance for widely shared consensus to emerge, thus promoting social cohesion between people from different backgrounds. Fishkin cites extensive empirical support for the increase in public spiritedness that is often caused by participation in deliberation, and says theoretical support can be traced back to foundational democratic thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville.See also Chapter 5 of Fishkin (2011), which gives detailed citations to the empirical work. The specific Mill work cited is Considerations on Representative Government (1861), and the specific Tocqueville work cited is Democracy in America (1835). Former diplomat Carne Ross writes that in 2011 that the debates arising from deliberative democracy are also much more civil, collaborative, and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums. For Ross, the key reason for this is that in deliberative democracy citizens are empowered by knowledge that their debates will have a measurable impact on society. Efforts to promote public participation have been widely critiqued. There is particular concern regarding the potential capture of the public into the sphere of influence of governance stakeholders, leaving communities frustrated by public participation initiatives, marginalized and ignored. A claimed failure of most theories of deliberative democracy is that they do not address the problems of voting. James Fishkin's 1991 work, \\"Democracy and Deliberation\\", introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making, by way of what he calls the deliberative opinion poll. In the deliberative opinion poll, a statistically representative sample of the nation or a community is gathered to discuss an issue in conditions that further deliberation. The group is then polled, and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances, to replace a vote. Dozens of deliberative opinion polls have been conducted across the United States since his book was published. The political philosopher Charles Blattberg has criticized deliberative democracy on four grounds: (i) the rules for deliberation that deliberative theorists affirm interfere with, rather than facilitate, good practical reasoning; (ii) deliberative democracy is ideologically biased in favor of liberalism as well as republican over parliamentary democratic systems; (iii) deliberative democrats assert a too- sharp division between just and rational deliberation on the one hand and self-interested and coercive bargaining or negotiation on the other; and (iv) deliberative democrats encourage an adversarial relationship between state and society, one that undermines solidarity between citizens. A criticism of deliberation is that potentially it allows those most skilled in rhetoric to sway the decision in their favour. This criticism has been made since deliberative democracy first arose in Ancient Athens. History Consensus- based decision making similar to deliberative democracy is characteristic of the hunter gather band societies thought to predominate in pre-historical times. As some of these societies became more complex with developments like division of labour, community-based decision making was displaced by various forms of authoritarian rule. The first example of democracy arose in Greece as Athenian democracy during the sixth century BC. Athenian democracy was both deliberative and largely direct: some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by ‚Ä≥the people‚Ä≥ directly. Athenian democracy came to an end in 322BC. When democracy was revived as a political system about 2000 years later, decisions were made by representatives rather than directly by the people. In a sense, this revived version was deliberative from its beginnings; for example, in 1774 Edmund Burke made a famous speech where he called Great Britain's parliament a deliberative assembly. Similarly, the Founding Fathers of the United States considered deliberation an essential part of the government they created in the late 18th century. The deliberative element of democracy was not widely studied by academics until the late 20th century. Although some of the seminal work was done in the 1970s and 80s, it was only in 1990 that deliberative democracy began to attract substantial attention from political scientists. According to Professor John Dryzek, early work on Deliberative Democracy was part of efforts to develop a theory of Democratic legitimacy. Theorists such as Carne Ross advocate deliberative democracy as a complete alternative to representative democracy. The more common view, held by contributors such as James Fishkin, is that direct deliberative democracy can be complementary to traditional representative democracy. Since 1994, hundreds of implementations of direct deliberative democracy have taken place throughout the world. For example, lay citizens have used deliberative democracy to determine local budget allocations in various cities and to undertake major public projects, such as the rebuilding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Association with political movements Call for the establishment of deliberative democracy on the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear Deliberative democracy recognizes a conflict of interest between the citizen participating, those affected or victimized by the process being undertaken, and the group-entity that organizes the decision. Thus it usually involves an extensive outreach effort to include marginalized, isolated, ignored groups in decisions, and to extensively document dissent, grounds for dissent, and future predictions of consequences of actions. It focuses as much on the process as the results. In this form it is a complete theory of civics. On the other hand, many practitioners of deliberative democracy attempt to be as neutral and open-ended as possible, inviting (or even randomly selecting) people who represent a wide range of views and providing them with balanced materials to guide their discussions. Examples include National Issues Forums, Choices for the 21st Century, study circles, deliberative opinion polls, the Citizens' Initiative Review, and the 21st-century town meetings convened by AmericaSpeaks, among others. In these cases, deliberative democracy is not connected to left-wing politics but is intended to create a conversation among people of different philosophies and beliefs. In Canada, there have been two prominent applications of deliberative democratic models. In 2004, the British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform convened a policy jury to consider alternatives to the first-past-the-post electoral systems. In 2007, the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform convened to consider alternative electoral systems in that province. Similarly, three of Ontario's Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) have referred their budget priorities to a policy jury for advice and refinement. The Green Party of the United States refers to its particular proposals for grassroots democracy and electoral reform by this name. Although not always the case, participation in deliberation has often been found to shift participants opinions in favour of Green positions, and can even cause a favourable change of voting intention. For example, with Europolis 2009, at the time one of the largest deliberative assemblies ever held, which set out to assess the public's view on a wide range of issues and included representatives from all 27 EU member nations, the share of citizens intending to vote for the Greens increased from 8% to 18%. Academic contributors According to Professor Stephen Tierney, perhaps the earliest notable example of academic interest in the deliberative aspects of democracy occurred in John Rawls 1971 work A Theory of Justice.Constitutional referendums: a theoretical enquiry (2009) by Prof Stephen Tierney (see esp. ft note 67) Joseph M. Bessette coined the term \\"deliberative democracy\\" in his 1980 work \\"Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government\\", and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in \\"The Mild Voice of Reason\\" (1994). Others contributing to the notion of deliberative democracy include Carlos Nino, Jon Elster, Roberto Gargarella, John Gastil, J√ºrgen Habermas, David Held, Joshua Cohen, John Rawls, Amy Gutmann, No√´lle McAfee, John Dryzek, Rense Bos, James S. Fishkin, Jane Mansbridge, Jose Luis Marti, Dennis Thompson, Benny Hjern, Hal Koch, Seyla Benhabib, Ethan Leib, Charles Sabel, Jeffrey K. Tulis, David Estlund, Mariah Zeisberg, Jeffrey L. McNairn, Iris Marion Young and Robert B. Talisse. Although political theorists took the lead in the study of deliberative democracy, political scientists have in recent years begun to investigate its processes. One of the main challenges currently is to discover more about the actual conditions under which the ideals of deliberative democracy are more or less likely to be realized.Thompson, Dennis F (2008). ‚ÄúDeliberative Democratic Theory and Empirical Political Science,‚Äù Annual Review of Political Science 11: 497-520. Most recently, scholarship has focused on the emergence of a ‚Äòsystemic approach‚Äô to the study of deliberation. This suggests that the deliberative capacity of a democratic system needs to be understood through the interconnection of the variety of sites of deliberation which exist, rather than any single setting.

Bozzo has hosted other talk shows under her name, including Laura en Am√©rica, back in the 1990s to early 2000s. Her talk shows have been compared to the Jerry Springer Show due to the fights that regularly occur as well as the sensitive subject matter routinely discussed. In 2008, a scandal erupted when it was discovered by the Peruvian press, led by important figures such as Jaime Bayly, that some of the shows provided by Bozzo were staged. Biography=Early life= Bozzo was born in Callao, Peru to engineer Miguel Bozzo Chirichignio and Victoria Luisa Rotondo Mendoza, both of Italian, Spanish, and Quechua descent; she holds Italian citizenship. She studied law at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru and at Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela receiving degrees in law and political science there and teaching classes within such fields in various universities. In 1987, she became the appointed officer of the Instituto Nacional de Cultura and organized competitions to promote the conservation of the cultural heritage of Peru. In 1992, she became the regidora (alderman) of metropolitan Lima. =Career= She began in television in 1994 with Las mujeres tienen la palabra a feminist cutting program in RBC Televisi√≥n. In 1997, Laura Bozzo went to Panamericana Televisi√≥n and assumes the conduct of the reality show Intimidades. A year later, Bozzo was hired by Am√©rica Televisi√≥n and launched Laura en Am√©rica, this program was very popular in Peru. Televisa (2014-03-19) Acerca de Laura Bozzo Retrieved on March 08, 2017 In 1998, she organized the organization Solidaridad de Familia (Family Solidarity) as a charitable foundation to assist people from Peru and other Latin American nations with legal, medical, and psychological problems; which has been under much criticism for increasing suspicion of being funded by former president Alberto Fujimori. In February 1998, the American Spanish-language broadcast network Telemundo began broadcasting her show Laura en Am√©rica on its affiliates. The show soon began to be shown all over Latin America. Similar in nature to the American Jerry Springer Show, it routinely featured guests usually having troubles within their lives, including infidelity. Usually, the show would expose evidence of wrongdoing by the suspect that the guest presents, leading to fighting between guests. The authenticity of the show has been questioned, given the unusually sensational subjects explored. By the end of the year, Bozzo moved to Miami, Florida. 2006, Bozzo's RAT contract with Telemundo expired after five years, so she moved her production to Televisa; production of Laura en America ended in July 2006. In October 2006, Bozzo appeared on the program ¬øD√≥nde est√°s coraz√≥n? on the network Antena 3 from Spain, criticizing Alejandro Toledo for causing her arrest. Just a few days before the one-year anniversary of her release from house arrest, Laura Bozzo was convicted of all the charges against her and was sentenced to four consecutive years in prison. Laura later informed a local television station, Canal 9, that she planned to use a newly enacted law in her favor and sue the Peruvian government. In January 2007, Bozzo attempted to enter the Spanish TV market through Spain's Telecinco, but once some executives saw pilots of the program, a proposal for a new Bozzo show was canceled. On November 6, 2007, her new show Laura en acci√≥n debuted on Telemundo in the United States. However, in March 2008, lawyer Freddy Escobar started an investigation about the possible illegal use of minors in her program, being exposed on TV to present fake cases of family sex violence. A scandal involving an underage woman who appeared on Laura en acci√≥n caused the show to be canceled by Peruvian network Am√©rica Televisi√≥n, in which the show originally aired. Telemundo stopped airing the series by the beginning of May 2008. In June 2009, Laura Bozzo made her television reappearance after her last talk show, Laura en Acci√≥n was cancelled on April 2008. Bozzo relocated herself in Mexico and started working on many shows on Televisa, the largest Spanish-speaking television network in all the World, but then she went to TV Azteca and hosted the talkshow Laura de todos (shortened from Laura de todos: sin miedo a la verdad), for two years and a half. Laura Bozzo's show aired on Azteca 13 at 17:00 hrs. CT in the country. The show was also televised in the United States, through Azteca America at 20:00 hrs. Laura left the show after having differences with the executives of TV Azteca. Bozzo was replaced by the Mexican television host Roc√≠o S√°nchez Azuara with the return of the talk show Cosas de la Vida. Laura Bozzo returned to Televisa. She signed a contract for five years with Televisa to make a new show called Laura herself and Federico Wilkins were the producers of Laura. Wilkins was fired after making up that Laura's boyfriend, Argentinian singer Christian Su√°rez who is 24 years her junior, was cheating on her with Karina Alvarez; Gabriel Vasquez Woodman took over the production. The talk show airs on Canal de las Estrellas network in Mexico. The show premiered on January 24, 2011, at 16:00 hrs the show airs for 1 hour and 30 minutes. (CT), the show also airs on Saturdays at 17 hrs. The show's premiere live in Mexico was very successful with 18.9 points in rating and 40.5 in share and on its second day the show reached 19.4 in rating beating its competition. Laura started airing in the United States through Telefutura (now UniM√°s) at 7/6c pm competing with Telemundo's Caso cerrado.http://entretenimiento.univision.com/lo- ultimo/shows/article/2011-01-25/laura-bozzo-llega-a-telefutura Laura Bozzo llega a TeleFutura Although the show was cancelled due to low ratings and other factors on April 2011, Telefutura aired Laura again at 2pm/1pm central in October 10, 2011 and since has become such a hit that it airs two hours a day starting at 11pm/10pm pacific.Laura Bozzo llega a TeleFutura (Revised) Criticism In September, 2013, Mexican social media ramped up criticisms against Laura Bozzo through Twitter and Facebook with the hashtags #LauraBozzoFueraDeMexico and #LauraBozzoMexicoNoTeQuiere, for using official State of Mexico government helicopters during a telecast allegedly used for the benefit of her show in order to set dramatic staging for the TV audience, while deferring rescue labors during the relief efforts for Hurricane Manuel. Criticism was sparked on Televisa's competitor, MVS networks, by Mexican journalist and noted Televisa detractorConflicto personal de Aristegui vs TelevisaCarmen Aristegui acusa a Televisa de estar detr√°s del ataque de Alejandro Puente Carmen Aristegui's recount on the story, first published in the political journal Proceso. This was followed by Bozzo's public contest of the allegations. A petition on Change.org has been made by civil group \\"CREAMOS M√©xico A.C.\\" to elicit her dismissal from Mexican TV.\\"Televisa: ¬°CORRAN A BOZZO! Necesitamos m√°s y mejores espacios para educarnos y no para embrutecernos m√°s\\", at change.org Personal life Bozzo married lawyer Mario de la Fuente in 1980. The couple had two daughters, Alejandra and Victoria. After twenty years of marriage, they divorced in August 2000. In 2000, Laura Bozzo stirred controversy by starting a relationship with Christian Suarez; 24 years her junior and former member of the Argentine musical group Complot.

A lengthy handwritten ransom note was found in the home. Her father, John, found the girl's body in the basement of their house about seven hours after she had been reported missing. She sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled; a garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that the official cause of death was \\"asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma\\". Her death was ruled a homicide. The case generated nationwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey (herself a former beauty queen) had entered JonBen√©t into a series of child beauty pageants. The crime is still unsolved and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department. The police initially suspected that the ransom note had been written by JonBen√©t's mother, and that the note and appearance of the child's body had been staged by her parents in order to cover up the crime. In 1998, the police and the district attorney (DA) both said that JonBen√©t's brother Burke, who was nine years old at the time of her death, was not a suspect. John and Patsy Ramsey gave several televised interviews but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against JonBen√©t's parents for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation. John and Patsy were also accused of hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had \\"committed ... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death\\". However, the DA determined that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a successful indictment. In 2002, the DA's successor took over investigation of the case from the police and primarily pursued the theory that an intruder had committed the killing. In 2003, trace DNA that was taken from the victim's clothes was found to belong to an unknown male; each of the family's DNA had been excluded from this match. The DA sent the Ramseys a letter of apology in 2008, declaring the family \\"completely cleared\\" by the DNA results. Others, including former Boulder police chief Mark Beckner, disagreed with exonerating the Ramseys, characterizing the DNA as a small piece of evidence that was not proven to have any connection to the crime. In February 2009, the Boulder police took the case back from the DA and reopened the investigation. Media coverage of the case has focused on JonBen√©t's brief beauty pageant career, as well as her parents' wealth and the unusual evidence found in the case. Media reports questioned how the police handled the case. Ramsey family members and their friends have filed defamation suits against several media organizations. Life and interment JonBen√©t's grave at Saint James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Georgia. JonBen√©t Ramsey was born in 1990 in Atlanta, Georgia, the younger of two children of Patricia (1956‚Äì2006) and John Ramsey (1943‚Äì). She had an older brother named Burke (1987‚Äì). Her first name combines her father's first and middle names, and her mother's first name was used as her middle name. JonBen√©t was enrolled in kindergarten at High Peaks Elementary School in Boulder, Colorado. JonBen√©t's body was found on December 26, 1996 in her family home in Boulder, Colorado. She was buried at St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Georgia on Tuesday December 31, 1996. She was interred next to her much older half-sister Elizabeth Pasch Ramsey, who had died in a car crash four years earlier at age 22. Parents John Ramsey was a businessman who was the president of Access Graphics, a computer system company that later became a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1978. His two surviving adult children (a son and a daughter) lived elsewhere. His 22-year-old daughter from the first marriage, Elizabeth, died in a 1992 car crash. In 1991, John had moved with his second wife and family to Boulder, where Access Graphics' headquarters was located. Patricia \\"Patsy\\" Ramsey entered their daughter in various child beauty pageants that were held in Boulder. JonBen√©t won the titles of America's Royale Miss, Little Miss Charlevoix, Little Miss Colorado, Colorado State All- Star Kids Cover Girl, and National Tiny Miss Beauty. JonBen√©t's active role in child beauty pageants and Patsy's reported \\"pageant mother\\" behavior were reported by the media after the murder. In the summer of 1997‚Äîapproximately six months after JonBen√©t's death‚Äîthe Ramseys moved to a new home in Atlanta after a summer at their vacation retreat in Charlevoix, Michigan. Patsy died of ovarian cancer at age 49 in 2006; she was interred next to her daughter. Evidence=Ransom note= The ransom note According to statements that Patsy gave to authorities on December 26, 1996, she realized that her daughter was missing after she found a two-and-a-half-page handwritten ransom note on the kitchen staircase. The note demanded . John pointed out to police first on the scene that the amount was nearly identical to his Christmas bonus of the prior year, which suggested that someone who would have access to that information would be involved in the crime. Investigators looked at several theories behind the dollar amount demanded. They considered employees at Access Graphics who may have known of the amount of John's prior bonus. They also considered the possibility that the ransom demand was a reference to Psalm 118, and spoke to religious sources to determine possible relevance.Schiller, Lawrence (1999). Perfect Murder, Perfect Town, p. 323, p. 447. HarperCollins, New York. The ransom note was unusually long. The Federal Bureau of Investigation told the police that it was very unusual for such a note to be written at the crime scene. The police believed that the note was staged, because it did not have any fingerprints except for Patsy's and authorities who had handled it, and because it included an unusual use of exclamation marks and initialisms. The note and a practice draft were written with a pen and pad of paper from the Ramsey home. According to a Colorado Bureau of Investigation report, \\"There are indications that the author of the ransom note is Patricia Ramsey.\\" However, the evidence fell short of a definitive conclusion. Michael Baden, a board-certified forensic pathologist, who had consulted with both sides of the case, said he had never seen a note like it in his 60-year experience, and that he did not think it was written by an outside stranger. A federal court ruled it highly unlikely that Patsy wrote the note, citing six certified handwriting experts. The court bemoaned the existence of self-proclaimed experts ‚Äì without credentials ‚Äì trying to wrangle their way into the case by accusing Patsy without scientific basis.Wolf v. Ramsey, 253 F. Supp. 2d 1323 (N.D. Ga. 2003) =9-1-1 call and initial search for the child= The only people known to be in the house on the night of JonBen√©t's death were her immediate family: Patsy and John Ramsey and their son Burke. The ransom note contained specific instructions against contacting police and friends, but Patsy telephoned the police at 5:52 a.m. MST. She also called family and friends. Two police officers responded to the 9-1-1 call and arrived at the Ramsey home within three minutes. They conducted a cursory search of the house but did not find any sign of forced entry. Officer Rick French went to the basement and came to a door that was secured by a wooden latch. He paused for a moment in front of the door, but walked away without opening it. French later explained that he was looking for an exit route used by the kidnapper, which the closed inside peg ruled out. JonBen√©t's body was later found behind the door. With JonBen√©t still missing, John made arrangements to pay the ransom. A forensics team was dispatched to the house. The team initially believed that the child had been kidnapped, and JonBen√©t's bedroom was the only room in the house that was cordoned off to prevent contamination of evidence. No precautions were taken to prevent contamination of evidence in the rest of the house. Meanwhile, friends and the family's minister arrived at the home to support the Ramseys. Victim advocates also arrived at the scene. Visitors picked up and cleaned surfaces in the kitchen, possibly destroying evidence. Boulder detective Linda Arndt arrived at about 8 a.m. MST, with the goal of awaiting the kidnapper(s)' instructions, but there was never an attempt by anyone to claim the money. =Discovery of the body= At 1:00 p.m. MST, Detective Arndt asked John Ramsey and Fleet White, a family friend, to search the house to see if \\"anything seemed amiss.\\" They started their search in the basement. John opened the latched door which Officer French had overlooked and found his daughter's body in one of the rooms. JonBen√©t's mouth was covered with duct tape, a nylon cord was found around her wrists and neck, and her torso was covered by a white blanket. John Ramsey picked up the child's body and took it upstairs. When JonBen√©t was moved, the crime scene was further contaminated, and critical forensic evidence was disturbed for the returning forensics team. Each of the Ramseys provided handwriting, blood, and hair samples to the police. John and Patsy participated in a preliminary interview for more than two hours, and Burke was also interviewed within the first couple of weeks following JonBen√©t's death. =Autopsy= The autopsy revealed that JonBen√©t had been killed by strangulation and a skull fracture. The official cause of death was \\"asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma.\\" There was no evidence of conventional rape, although sexual assault could not be ruled out. Although no semen was found, there was evidence that there had been a vaginal injury. At the time of the autopsy, the pathologist recorded that it appeared her vaginal area had been wiped with a cloth. Her death was ruled a homicide. A garrote that was made from a length of nylon cord and the broken handle of a paintbrush was tied around JonBen√©t's neck and had apparently been used to strangle her. Part of the bristle end of the paintbrush was found in a tub containing Patsy's art supplies, but the bottom third of it was never found despite extensive searching of the house by the police in subsequent days. The autopsy revealed a \\"vegetable or fruit material which may represent pineapple,\\" which JonBen√©t had eaten a few hours before her death. Photographs of the home taken on the day when JonBen√©t's body was found show a bowl of pineapple on the kitchen table with a spoon in it. However, neither John nor Patsy said they remembered putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBen√©t. Police reported that they found JonBen√©t's nine-year-old brother Burke Ramsey's fingerprints on the bowl. The Ramseys have always said that Burke slept through the entire night until he was awakened several hours after the police arrived. =Blood samples= In December 2003, forensic investigators extracted enough material from a mixed blood sample found on JonBen√©t's underwear to establish a DNA profile. That DNA belonged to an unknown male person, and excluded the DNA of each of the Ramseys. The DNA was submitted to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a database containing more than 1.6 million DNA profiles, but the sample did not match any profile in the database. In October 2016, a report said that new forensic analysis with more sensitive techniques revealed that the original DNA contained genetic markers from two individuals other than JonBen√©t. A. James Kolar, who was a lead investigator for the D.A.'s office, said that there were additional traces of male DNA found on the cord and paintbrush that Boulder district attorney Mary Lacy did not mention, and that there were six separate DNA samples belonging to unknown individuals that were found by the test. Former FBI profiler Candice Delong believes that the DNA, having shown up identically in several different places on multiple surfaces, belongs to the killer.https://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/19/burke-ramsey-hopes-jonbenet- murder-investigation-finds-killer/ Former Adams County, Colorado, District Attorney Bob Grant, who has assisted the Boulder DA's office on the case for many years, also believes that the DNA evidence is significant, saying that any resolution of the case would have to explain how the DNA showed up on several pieces of JonBen√©t's clothing.http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_30317043/boulder-police-chief-updates- jonbenet-ramsey-case-20 Forensic pathologist Michael Baden said, \\"Trace amounts of DNA can get on places and clothing from all different, nonsuspicious means. There is no forensic evidence to show that this is a stranger murder.\\" Investigation Experts, media commentators, and the Ramseys have identified potential suspects in the case. Boulder police initially focused almost exclusively upon John and Patsy, but by October 1997 had over 1,600 people in their index of persons of interest for the case. Errors that were made in the initial investigation complicated the resolution of the investigation and applicable theory. Those errors included loss and contamination of evidence, lack of experienced and technical staff on the investigation, evidence shared with the Ramseys, and delayed informal interviews with the parents. Lou Smit was a detective who came out of retirement in early 1997 to assist the Boulder County District Attorney's office with the case. In May 1998, he presented his findings to the Boulder police with other staff members of the DA's Office, concluding that the evidence pointed away from the Ramseys. They were unable to successfully challenge the police department's belief that the Ramseys were guilty. The DA's office sought to take control of the investigation. Due to the animosity between the police and the DA's office, and the pressure to obtain a conviction, Colorado governor Roy Romer interceded and named Michael Kane as special prosecutor to initiate a grand jury. Two of the lead investigators in the case had opposing views. Both Lou Smit and Steve Thomas ultimately resigned Smit because he believed that the investigation had incompetently overlooked the intruder hypothesis, and Thomas because the DA's office had interfered with and failed to support the police investigation of the case. A grand jury was convened beginning September 15, 1998 to consider indicting the Ramseys for charges relating to the case. In 1999, the grand jury returned a true bill to charge the Ramseys with placing the child at risk in a way that led to her death and with obstructing an investigation of murder, based on the probable cause standard applied in such grand jury proceedings. But Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter did not prosecute them, because he did not believe that he could meet the higher standard of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that is required for a criminal conviction. Mary Lacy, the next Boulder County District Attorney, took over the investigation from the police on December 26, 2002. In April 2003, she agreed with a federal judge who sat on a 2002 libel case that evidence in the suit is \\"more consistent with a theory that an intruder murdered JonBen√©t than it was with a theory that Mrs. Ramsey did\\". On July 9, 2008, the Boulder District Attorney's office announced that, as a result of newly developed DNA sampling and testing techniques (touch DNA analysis), the Ramsey family members were excluded as suspects in the case. Lacy publicly exonerated the Ramseys. On February 2, 2009, Boulder police chief Mark Beckner announced that Stan Garnett, the new Boulder County District Attorney, was turning the case over to his agency, and that his team would resume investigating it. Garnett found that the statute of limitations for the crimes identified in the 1999 grand jury true bill had expired, and did not pursue review of the case against the Ramseys. In October 2010, the Boulder police reopened the cold case. New interviews were conducted following a fresh inquiry by a committee that included state and federal investigators. Police were expected to use the latest DNA technology in their investigation. There was no new information gleaned from those interviews. It was reported in September 2016 that the investigation into JonBen√©t's death continues to be an active homicide case, per Boulder Police Chief Greg Testa. In 2015, Beckner disagreed with exonerating the Ramseys, stating, \\"Exonerating anyone based on a small piece of evidence that has not yet been proved to even be connected to the crime is absurd.\\" He also stated that the unknown DNA from JonBenet's clothing \\"has got to be the focus of the investigation\\" at this point in time and that, until one can prove otherwise, \\"the suspect is the donator [sic] of that unknown DNA.\\"http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_27591666/mark-beckner-opens-up-about- jonbenet-ramsey-case In 2016, Gordon Coombes, a former investigator for the Boulder County District Attorney's office, also questioned total absolution of the Ramseys, stating, \\"We all shed DNA all the time within our skin cells. It can be deposited anywhere at any time for various reasons, reasons that are benign. To clear somebody just on the premise of touch DNA, especially when you have a situation where the crime scene wasn't secure at the beginning ... really is a stretch.\\" Steven E. Pitt, a forensic psychiatrist hired by Boulder authorities, said, \\"Lacy's public exoneration of the Ramseys was a big slap in the face to Chief Beckner and the core group of detectives who had been working on the case for years.\\" Theories and suspects=Family member theory= There are two types of theories about the death of JonBen√©t. One is the family member theory. Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon the parents, John and Patsy Ramsey. According to Gregg McCrary, a retired profiler with the FBI, \\"statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it's a family member or a care giver\\" who is involved in the homicide of a child. The police saw no evidence of a forced entry, but they did see evidence of staging of the scene, such as the ransom note. They did not find the Ramseys cooperative in helping them solve the death of their daughter. The Ramseys had said that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to the Daily Camera. One theory is that Patsy struck JonBen√©t in a fit of rage after a bedwetting episode, and strangled her to cover up what had happened, after mistakenly thinking she was already dead. However, Patsy did not have a known history of uncontrolled anger. JonBen√©t's brother later said, \\"We didn't get spanked, nothing of the sort, nothing close, nothing near laying a finger on us, let alone killing your child.\\" Theoretically, the strangulation could have been a \\"red herring\\" aspect to conceal other elements of the assault and killing. Burke, who was nine years old at the time of JonBen√©t's death, was interviewed by investigators at least three times. The first two interviews did not raise any concerns about him. A review by a child psychologist stated that it appeared that the Ramseys had \\"healthy, caring family relationships\\". In 1998, Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner said during an interview with a news reporter that Burke Ramsey was not involved in the killing of his sister. In May 1999, the Boulder County District Attorney's office reiterated that Burke Ramsey was not a suspect. The investigators had never considered him a suspect. The Ramseys offered a $100,000 reward in a newspaper ad dated April 27, 1997. Three days later, more than four months after the body of their daughter was found, they submitted for the first time to separate formal interviews at the Boulder County Justice Center. In 1999, Colorado Governor Bill Owens spoke out, telling the Ramsey couple to \\"quit hiding behind their attorneys, quit hiding behind their PR firm\\". A Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents. The indictment cited \\"two counts each of child abuse\\" and said the parents \\"did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBen√©t Ramsey, a child under the age of sixteen.\\" Among the experts who testified in the case were DNA specialist Barry Scheck and forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee. On October 13, 1999, Alex Hunter, who was the district attorney at the time, refused to sign the indictment, saying that the evidence was insufficient for prosecution. The public thought that the grand jury investigation had been inconclusive. In 2002, the statute of limitations on the grand jury's charges expired. The grand jury's vote to indict was not revealed publicly until October 25, 2013, when previously sealed court documents were released. The Case of: JonBen√©t Ramsey, a show broadcast on CBS on September 18 and 19, 2016, said that they used a group of experts to evaluate the evidence. The group theorized that Burke hit his sister in the head with a heavy object, perhaps not intending to kill her. They suggested that the ransom letter was an attempt to cover up the circumstances of JonBenet's death. On behalf of Burke Ramsey, his counsel Wood filed defamation lawsuits against CBS, the producers of the program, and several of its participants, based on many of its claims.\\"Burke Ramsey- JonBenet/ CBS series lawsuit\\", People magazine =Intruder theory= The second theory is the intruder theory. The police and the prosecutors followed leads for intruders partly due to the unidentified boot mark left in the basement room where JonBen√©t's body was found. Early persons of interest included neighbor Bill McReynolds, who played Santa Claus; former family housekeeper Linda Hoffmann- Pugh, and a man named Michael Helgoth, who died in an apparent suicide shortly after JonBen√©t's death. Hundreds of DNA tests were performed to find a match to the DNA recovered during her autopsy. Smit assessed the evidence and concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. On the night JonBen√©t was killed, there had been two windows that were left slightly open to allow for electrical cords for the outside Christmas lights to pass through, a broken basement window, and one unlocked door. Smit's theory was that someone entered the Ramsey home through the broken basement window. This has been criticized because there was an intact cobweb in the basement window. The steel grate that covered the window also had undisturbed cobwebs, and the foliage around the grate had been undisturbed. There were also cobwebs in the tracks of various windows, and dust and debris were on some sills. Smit believed that the intruder subdued JonBen√©t using a stun gun and took her down to the basement. JonBen√©t was killed and a ransom note was left. Smit's theory was supported by former FBI agent John E. Douglas, who had been hired by the Ramsey family. Believing that the Ramseys were innocent, Smit resigned from the investigation on September 20, 1998, five days after the grand jury was convened against the Ramseys. While no longer an official investigator on the case, Smit continued to work on it until his death in 2010. Stephen Singular, author of the book Presumed Guilty: An Investigation into the JonBen√©t Ramsey Case, the Media and the Culture of Pornography (2016), refers to consultations with cyber-crime specialists who believe that JonBen√©t, due to her beauty pageant experience, could have attracted the attention of child pornographers and pedophiles. It was determined that there had been more than 100 burglaries in the Ramseys' neighborhood in the months before JonBen√©t's murder. There were 38 registered sex offenders living within a two-mile (3 km) radius of the Ramseys' home. In 2001, former Boulder County prosecutor Trip DeMuth and Boulder County Sheriff's Detective Steve Ainsworth stated that there should be a more aggressive investigation of the intruder theory. One of the individuals whom Smit identified as a suspect was Gary Howard Oliva, who was arrested for \\"two counts of attempted sexual exploitation of a child and one count of sexual exploitation of a child\\" charges in June 2016, according to Boulder's Daily Camera. Oliva, a registered sex offender, was publicly identified as a suspect in an October 2002 episode of 48 Hours Investigates. The Killing of JonBen√©t: The Truth Uncovered, broadcast by A&E; on September 5, 2016, concluded that an unidentified male was responsible for JonBen√©t's death, based on forensic DNA analysis of evidence. In the documentary, Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky stated that \\"an unidentified male committed this crime\\". The District Attorney's office investigating pedophiles indicated to former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman that the District Attorney's office followed the intruder theory. The Ramseys developed a relationship with District Attorney Mary Lacy and her office, which was criticized by authorities such as the city's mayor, Leslie L Durgin. Silverman said, \\"Once you have conceded the possibility of an intruder, I don't see how any Ramsey could ever be successfully prosecuted.\\" Gordon Coombes joined the office as an investigator under Lacy when they were testing JonBen√©t's clothing for touch DNA. He also said that Lacy strongly supported the intruder theory and talked about it with the staff. Although he was not directly involved with the case, he said he was told not to voice opposition to the theory because he might lose his job. \\"It just seemed weird the whole premise of ... this attempt to influence the entire agency,\\" he stated. False confession John Mark Karr, a 41-year-old elementary school teacher, was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand, on August 15, 2006 when he falsely confessed to murdering JonBen√©t. He claimed that he had drugged, sexually assaulted, and accidentally killed her. According to CNN, \\"Authorities also said they did not find any evidence linking [Karr] to the crime scene.\\" In his confession, Karr had provided only basic facts that were publicly known and failed to provide any convincing details. His claim that he had drugged JonBen√©t was doubted because the autopsy indicated that no drugs were found in her body. DNA samples that were taken from Karr did not match DNA found on JonBen√©t's body. Defamation lawsuits Lin Wood, the Ramseys' family libel attorney, filed defamation lawsuits against several people and companies that had reported on the case, starting in 1999. They sued Star magazine and its parent company American Media, Inc. on their son's behalf in 1999. Defamation suits have been filed by the Ramseys and their friends against several unnamed media outlets. A defamation suit was filed in 2001 against the authors and publisher of JonBen√©t: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation (2000). The suit against Don Davis, Steven Thomas, and St. Martin's Press was settled out of court the following year. John and Patsy Ramsey were sued in two defamation lawsuits arising from the publication of their book, The Death of Innocence (2001). These suits were brought by two persons named in the book who were said to have been investigated by Boulder police as suspects in the case. The Ramseys were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer. They obtained the dismissal of both lawsuits. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes later concluded that \\"abundant evidence\\" in the murder case pointed to an intruder having committed the crime. In November 2006, Rod Westmoreland, a friend of John Ramsey, filed a defamation suit against an anonymous web surfer who had posted two messages on Internet forums using the pseudonym \\"undertheradar\\" implicating Westmoreland in the murder. During a September 2016 interview with CBS Detroit and in The Case of: JonBen√©t Ramsey documentary television program, forensic pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz accused Burke Ramsey of killing his sister. On October 6, 2016, Burke filed a defamation lawsuit against Spitz. Burke and his attorneys, who include Lin Wood, sought a total of $150 million in punitive and compensatory damages. Wood said he would also file a suit against CBS at the end of October 2016. On December 28, 2016, Burke Ramsey's lawyers filed an additional civil lawsuit that accused CBS, the production company Critical Content LLC, and seven experts and consultants of defamation of character. They sought $250 million in compensatory damages and $500 million in punitive damages. In January 2018, a judge denied the CBS motion to dismiss, and the suit was allowed to proceed.

The diagram depicts the removal of the donor nucleus for schematic purposes; in practice the whole donor cell is transferred. In genetics and developmental biology, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a laboratory strategy for creating a viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell. The technique consists of taking an enucleated oocyte (egg cell) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic (body) cell. It is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning. In 1996, Dolly the sheep became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal. In January 2018, a team of scientists in Shanghai announced the successful cloning of two female crab-eating macaques (named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua) from fetal nuclei. \\"Therapeutic cloning\\" refers to the potential use of SCNT in regenerative medicine; this approach has been championed as an answer to the many issues concerning embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use, though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types truly are. Introduction Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg. When this is done, the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote. The blastocyst stage is developed by the egg which helps to create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. The first animal that was developed by this technique was Dolly, the sheep, in 1996. Process The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, known as the ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to the cells of the human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term. Applications=Stem cell research= Somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research. The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo. These cells genetically matched the donor organism from which they came. This gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells, which could then be used in therapies or disease research. Embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos. Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method. A potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient's particular disease. By doing so, an in vitro model could be created, would be useful for studying that particular disease, potentially discovering its pathophysiology, and discovering therapies. For example, if a person with Parkinson's disease donated his or her somatic cells, the stem cells resulting from SCNT would have genes that contribute to Parkinson's disease. The disease specific stem cell lines could then be studied in order to better understand the condition. Another application of SCNT stem cell research is using the patient specific stem cell lines to generate tissues or even organs for transplant into the specific patient. The resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor, thus avoiding any complications from immune system rejection. Only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using SCNT techniques in human stem cell research. In the United States, scientists at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the University of California San Francisco, the Oregon Health & Science University, Stemagen (La Jolla, CA) and possibly Advanced Cell Technology are currently researching a technique to use somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce embryonic stem cells.Elizabeth Weise, \\"Cloning race is on again\\", USA Today (January 17, 2006, retrieved October 6, 2006) In the United Kingdom, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has granted permission to research groups at the Roslin Institute and the Newcastle Centre for Life.\\"Dolly scientists' human clone bid\\", BBC News (September 28, 2004, retrieved October 6, 2006) SCNT may also be occurring in China.Charles C. Mann, \\"The First Cloning Superpower\\", Wired (January 2003, retrieved October 6, 2006) In 2005, a South Korean research team led by Professor Hwang Woo-suk, published claims to have derived stem cell lines via SCNT, but supported those claims with fabricated data. Recent evidence has proved that he in fact created a stem cell line from a parthenote., Nature Stem Cell Blog., The Scientist 19 June 2007 Though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals, questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum. Despite many attempts, success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited. There lies a problem in the human cell's ability to form a blastocyst; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development. This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development. These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success. A research group from the Oregon Health & Science University demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully using skin cells. The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II (MII) of the cell cycle. Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states. When the ovum's nucleus is removed, the cell loses its genetic information. This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability. It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes, enucleation negatively affects these factors. Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast, affecting reprogramming ability. Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells. In May 2013, the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT, using fetal and infant donor cells. Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure, human clone embryos were successfully produced. These embryos were of poor quality, lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed trophectoderm. The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC. The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum's nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation. The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas, expressed pluripotent transcription factors, and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype, indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC-like. This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells. This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC. In April 2014, an international research team expanded on this break through. There remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells. Epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed. Implementing the procedure pioneered by the Oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by SCNT using adult cells from two donors aged 35 and 75, indicating that age does not impede a cell's ability to be reprogrammed.Human Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Using Adult Cells Cell Stem Cell. Retrieved 18 April 2014Ariana Eunjung Cha (18 April 2014) Cloning advance using stem cells from human adult reopens ethical questions Washington Post. Retrieved 18 April 2014 Late April 2014, the New York Stem Cell Foundation was successful in creating SCNT stem cells derived from adult somatic cells. One of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic. The group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation. When injected into mice, cells of all three of the germ layers successfully formed. The most significant of these cells, were those who expressed insulin and were capable of secreting the hormone. These insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics, demonstrating real SCNT stem cell therapeutic potential. The impetus for SCNT-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into pluripotent stem cells were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based stem cell research: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases. Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron. This raises the question of how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments, as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type. SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies. =Reproductive cloning= BTX ECM 2001 Electrofusion generator used for SCNT and Cloning applications This technique is currently the basis for cloning animals (such as the famous Dolly the sheep), and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with moral and ethical objections, reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries. Most researchers believe that in the foreseeable future it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term. It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT. There is also the potential for treating diseases associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Recent studies show SCNT of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease. This treatment does not involve cloning but would produce a child with three genetic parents. A father providing a sperm cell, one mother providing the egg nucleus, and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell. In 2018, the first successful cloning of primates using somatic cell nuclear transfer, the same method as Dolly the sheep, with the birth of two live female clones (crab-eating macaques named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua) was reported. =Interspecies nuclear transfer= Interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species, or even to restore species after their extinction. The technique is similar to SCNT cloning which typically is between domestic animals and rodents, or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals. However, the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning. Interspecies nuclear transfer utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus. In 2000, Robert Lanza was able to produce a cloned fetus of a gaur, Bos gaurus, combining it successfully with a domestic cow, Bos taurus. Interspecies nuclear transfer provides evidence of the universality of the triggering mechanism of the cell nucleus reprogramming. For example, Gupta et al., explored the possibility of producing transgenic cloned embryos by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) of cattle, mice, and chicken donor cells into enucleated pig oocytes. Moreover, NCSU23 medium, which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos, was able to support the in vitro development of cattle, mice, and chicken iSCNT embryos up to the blastocyst stage. Furthermore, ovine oocyte cytoplast may be used for remodeling and reprogramming of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage. Limitations SCNT can be inefficient. Stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous, resulting in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells. For example, in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood. As the procedure was not automated, but had to be performed manually under a microscope, SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood. However, by 2014, researchers were reporting success rates of 70-80% with cloning pigsShukman, David (14 January 2014) China cloning on an 'industrial scale' BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014 and in 2016 a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day. In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT-derived tissues and organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant. Controversy Human blastocyst, showing the inner cell mass (top, right) Proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo. These have led to some individuals and organizations who are not opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about, or opposed to, SCNT research.Jeremy Rifkin. (February 18, 2002). \\"Fusion Biopolitics\\". The Nation. Retrieved on August 7, 2006.Sheryl Gay Stolberg, \\"Some for Abortion Rights Lean Right in Cloning Fight\\", New York Times (January 24, 2002)Lori B. Andrews, et al., Open Letter to US Senate on Human Cloning , (March 19, 2002) One concern is that blastula creation in SCNT-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction,Lori B. Andrews et al. (March 19, 2002).\\"Open Letter to US Senators on Human Cloning and Eugenic Engineering\\". Retrieved on August 7, 2006 or its prohibition. A second important concern is the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human egg cells, which can only be obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. One vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients. Each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient's own DNA, thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment. For example, to treat a man with Parkinson's disease, a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by SCNT into an egg cell from an egg donor, creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient's own cells. (There would be differences. For example, the mitochondrial DNA would be the same as that of the egg donor. In comparison, his own cells would carry the mitochondrial DNA of his mother.) Potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy, and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line. Such large numbers of donated eggs would exceed the number of eggs currently left over and available from couples trying to have children through assisted reproductive technology. Therefore, healthy young women would need to be induced to sell eggs to be used in the creation of custom stem cell lines that could then be purchased by the medical industry and sold to patients. It is so far unclear where all these eggs would come from. Stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use on a large scale on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time. To address the problem of creating a human egg market, some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs. If successful, human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines. However, this technology may be a long way off. Policies regarding human SCNT SCNT involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the United Kingdom, having been incorporated into the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.Andy Coghlan, \\"Cloning opponents fear loopholes in new UK law\\", New Scientist (November 23, 2001, retrieved October 6, 2006) Permission must be obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in order to perform or attempt SCNT. In the United States, the practice remains legal, as it has not been addressed by federal law.\\"Chapter 5: Legal and Policy Considerations. Cloning Human Beings\\" Report and Recommendations of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, June 1997. Accessed 21 Oct 06 However, in 2002, a moratorium on United States federal funding for SCNT prohibits funding the practice for the purposes of research. Thus, though legal, SCNT cannot be federally funded. American scholars have recently argued that because the product of SCNT is a clone embryo, rather than a human embryo, these policies are morally wrong and should be revised. In 2003, the United Nations adopted a proposal submitted by Costa Rica, calling on member states to \\"prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.\\"United Nations, \\"General Assembly Adopts United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning By Vote of 84-34-37\\", press release (August 3, 2005, retrieved October 6, 2006) This phrase may include SCNT, depending on interpretation.

Etymology Tomboy, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was originally used to refer to, \\"brash, boisterous, or self-assured youth.\\" The OED dates the first printed use of the term to Ralph Roister Doister, published in 1567. Society and culture=History and sexual orientation= Author Michelle Ann Abate stated that, in nineteenth-century American culture, the usage of the word tomboy came to refer to a specific code of conduct that permitted young girls to exercise, wear \\"sensible clothing\\", and to eat a \\"wholesome diet\\". Because of the emphasis on a healthier lifestyle, tomboyism quickly grew in popularity during this time period as an alternative to the dominant feminine code of conduct that had limited women's physical movement. Abate stated that this mode of behavior was planned to enhance the power and durability of the country's coming brides and child-bearers and the progeny that they birthed. She said that tomboyism was more than a new fostering method or gender statement for the country's young women; it was also a way to improve the genetic quality of the human population and at least a way to assert white racial supremacy. In her 1898 book Women and Economics, feminist writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman lauds the health benefits of being a tomboy as well as the freedom for gender exploration: \\"not feminine till it is time to be\\". Joseph Lee, a playground advocate, wrote in 1915 that the tomboy phase was crucial to physical development between the ages of eight and thirteen. Tomboyism remained popular through World War I and World War II in society, literature, and then film. During the twentieth century, Freudian psychology and backlash against LGBT social movements resulted in societal fears about the sexualities of tomboys, and this caused some to question if tomboyism leads to lesbianism. Throughout history, there has been a perceived correlation between tomboyishness and lesbianism. For instance, Hollywood films would stereotype the adult tomboy as a \\"predatory butch dyke\\". Lynne Yamaguchi and Karen Barber, editors of Tomboys! Tales of Dyke Derring-Do, argue that \\"tomboyhood is much more than a phase for many lesbians\\", it \\"seems to remain a part of the foundation of who we are as adults\\". Many contributors to Tomboys! linked their self- identification as tomboys and lesbians to both labels positioning them outside \\"cultural and gender boundaries\\". Psychoanalyst Dianne Elise's essay reported that more lesbians noted being a tomboy than straight women. However, while some tomboys later reveal a lesbian identity in their adolescent or adult years, behavior typical of boys but displayed by girls is not a true indicator of one's sexual orientation. =Gender roles and stereotypes = The idea that there are girl activities and clothing, and that there are boy activities and clothing, is often reinforced by the tomboy concept. Tomboyism can be seen as both refusing gender roles and traditional gender conventions, but also conforming to gender stereotypes. The concept may be considered outdated or looked at from a positive viewpoint. Feminine traits are often devalued and unwanted, and tomboys often echo this viewpoint, especially toward girly girls. This can be due in part to an environment that desires and only values masculinity. Idealized male masculinity is atop the hegemony and sets the traditional standard, and is often upheld and spread by young children, especially through children playing with one another. Tomboys may view femininity as having been pushed on them, which result in negative feelings toward femininity and those that embrace it. In this case, masculinity may be seen as a defense mechanism against the harsh push toward femininity, and a reclaiming of agency that is often lost due to sexist ideas of what girls are and are not able to do. Tomboys are expected to one day cease their masculine behavior. Usually, during or right before puberty, they will return to feminine behavior, and are expected to embrace heteronormativity. Tomboys who do not do such are often stigmatized, usually due to homophobia. Creed writes that the tomboy's \\"image undermines patriarchal gender boundaries that separate the sexes\\", and thus is a \\"threatening figure\\". This threat affects and challenges the idea of what a family must look like, generally nuclear independent heterosexual couplings with two children. Gender scholar Jack (also known as Judith) Halberstam states that while the defying of gender roles is often tolerated in young girls, adolescent girls who display masculine traits are often repressed or punished. However, the ubiquity of traditionally female clothing such as skirts and dresses has declined in the Western world, where it is generally no longer considered a male trait for girls and women not to wear such clothing. An increase in the popularity of women's sporting events (see Title IX) and other activities that were traditionally male-dominated has broadened tolerance and lessened the impact of tomboy as a pejorative term. Instead, as sociologist Barrie Thorne suggested, some \\"adult women tell with a hint of pride as if to suggest: I was (and am) independent and active; I held (and hold) my own with boys and men and have earned their respect and friendship; I resisted (and continue to resist) gender stereotypes\\". Filipino tomboys are masculine-presenting women who have relations with other women, with the other women tending to be more feminine, although not exclusively, or transmasculine people who have relationships with women; the former appears more common than the latter. Women who engage in romantic relationships with other women, but who are not masculine, are often still deemed heterosexual. This leads to more invisibility for those that are lesbian and feminine. Scholar Kale Bantigue Fajardo argues for the similarity between \\"tomboy\\" in the Philippines and \\"tombois in Indonesia\\", and \\"toms in Thailand\\" all as various forms of female masculinity. =Fiction= Tomboys in fictional stories are often used to contrast a more girly and traditionally feminine character. These characters are also often the ones that undergo a makeover scene in which they learn to be feminine, often under the goal of getting a male partner. Usually with the help of the more girly character, they transform from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan, ignoring past objectives and often framed in a way that they have become their best self. Doris Day's character in Calamity Jane is one example of this; Allison from The Breakfast Club is another. Tomboy figures who do not eventually go on to conform to feminine and heterosexual expectations often simply remain in their childhood tomboy state, eternally ambiguous. The stage of life where tomboyism is acceptable is very short and rarely are tomboys allowed to peacefully and happily age out of it without changing and without giving up their tomboyness. Tomboyism in fiction often symbolizes new types of family dynamics, often following a death or another form of disruption to the nuclear family unit, leading families of choice rather than blood. This provides a further challenge to the family unit, including often critiques of socially who is allowed to be a family ‚Äì including critiques of class and often a women's role in a family. Tomboyism can be argued to even begin to normalize and encourage the inclusion of other marginalized groups and types of families in fiction including, LGBT families or racialized groups. This is all due to the challenging of gender roles, and assumptions of maternity and motherhood that tomboys inhabit. Tomboys are also used in patriotic stories, in which the female character wishes to serve in a war, for a multitude of reasons. One reason is patriotism and wanting to be on the front lines. This often ignores the many other ways women were able to participate in war efforts and instead retells only one way of serving by using one's body. This type of story often follows the trope of the tomboy being discovered after being injured, and plays with the particular ways bodies get revealed, policed and categorized. This type of story is also often nationalistic, and the tomboy is usually presented as the hero that more female characters should look up to, although they still often shed some of their more extreme ways after the war. Studies There have been few studies of the causality of women's behavior and interests when they do not match the female gender role. One report from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children suggests that preschool girls engaging in masculine-typical gender- role behavior, such as playing with toys typically preferred by boys, is influenced by genetic and prenatal factors. Tomboys have also been noted to demonstrate a stronger interest in science and technology.

As a result of the administrative territorial reform of Latvia in 2009, J≈´rmala became one of the republican cities of Latvia (Republikas pilsƒìtas), and is currently (2011) the fifth largest by population. History Jomas street in Jurmala The city of J≈´rmala actually consists of a string of small resorts. From west to east, these include ƒ∂emeri, Jaunƒ∑emeri, Sloka, Kauguri, Vaivari, Asari, Mellu≈æi, Pumpuri, Jaundubulti, Dubulti, Majori, Dzintari, Bulduri and Lielupe. J≈´rmala's reputation as a spa destination began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Wealthy landowners began the tradition of relaxing at the seaside, and Russian army officers came here to rest after the Napoleonic Wars, returning later with their families. The peak of the J≈´rmala area's development was the opening of the Riga - Tukums railway in 1877 (which still passes through J≈´rmala) that gave a great boost to the numbers of visitors, and thus a boost to the development of the town as a resort. J≈´rmala also gained a reputation as a health spa. The sea breeze, pine aroma, mineral springs, and sandy beach encouraged many sanatoriums to develop within the city. In Soviet times J≈´rmala was popular with the Communist officials because of its beach and sanatoriums - holidays were also given as rewards for top union members. It became one of the most popular holiday destinations in the whole Union. The spas offered facilities from mud baths to riding therapy and hiking in the woods. In summer there are many concerts. Whereas Riga has advanced rapidly to embrace and cater for growing numbers of Western tourists, J≈´rmala has lagged behind. Russians are now subject to strict visa requirements and its beaches have yet to attract significant numbers of Europeans, leaving the tourist industry with a hard task on its hands. However, during the past few years, J≈´rmala has started to recover. Many Russian celebrities, successful businessmen and others buy houses near the beach, and a variety of festivals and other activities attract increasing crowds each summer. At the moment, J≈´rmala has almost resumed the popularity that it had with the Soviet elite. The main beach at Majori and another at Bulduri now bear blue eco-flags signalling the sea is clean and safe to swim in, and the Latvian Academy of Science boasts a hotel for its members in the town. There is also the Midsummer Festival in June, celebrating the longest day of the year. The \\"Jaunais Vilnis\\" New Wave (competition) music festival showcases the latest music from all over Europe. The Lonely Planet guide to the region states that it is one of the highlights of Latvia. Architecture J≈´rmala is famous for its wooden houses. The most distinguishing architectural feature in J≈´rmala is the prevalence of wooden houses dating from the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Most of the buildings were built by Baltic German and Latvian architects, but there are also works of Russian, Finnish and other architects. J≈´rmala's architecture typically falls into classicism, national romanticism, and modern styles. The town has an official list of 414 historical buildings under protection, as well as over 4,000 wooden structures.. Dubulti Station is an example of sculptural concrete shell Modernist architecture. Former Swimming Establishment of Emilija Racene on the beach in Majori - The building was constructed at the beginning of the 20th century and saw its expansion in 1914. During Soviet times the building hosted resort clinics that were among the most well-arranged treatment establishments in Jurmala. Beach J≈´rmala's beach is long, covered with white quartz sand. The shallow coastal waters are suitable and safe for children. The beach is equipped with playgrounds, small benches, football fields and volleyball courts, as well as descents for prams and wheelchairs. In spring and autumn amber pieces can be found on the beach. Each region's beach has its own character. In Majori and Bulduri, where the Blue Flag flies, it is possible to rent water bicycles or relax in the beach cafe. In Dubulti and Dzintari competitions in beach football and volleyball take place, but on Pumpuri beach there is kite surfing and windsurfing. International water sports contests, including rowing, sailing, and waterskiing that take place on the river Lielupe.

In 1936, President KƒÅrlis Ulmanis officially opened one of the most prestigious buildings in Latvia at the time, Hotel \\"ƒ∂emeri\\" with 100 comfortable rooms and a luxurious hall. The building was designed by architect Eizen Laube and was built by public funds. After World War II, it was transformed into a sanatorium with 300 beds for treating problems with nervous systems, as well as patients with joint, bones and musculoskeletal and gynaecological diseases from the Soviet republics with a very wide range of health resorts and medical services. After the restoration of Latvia's independence, the building was privatised and its reconstruction started, but the project was unsuccessful and reconstruction has still not been completed.

Transport = Railway = The railway Riga-Tukums was built in 1875‚Äì1877. The route chosen included the narrow isthmus between Lielupe and the Gulf of Riga. A stretch of 13 km of the line runs within a kilometre of the sea, and there are ten stations within easy walking distance from the beach. This was a big boost to the development of J≈´rmala as a series of resorts along the coast. In 1912 a direct train connection was established with Moscow. The railway through J≈´rmala is currently double-track and electrified.J≈´rmala, Renate KƒÅrkli≈Üa, NationƒÅlais apgƒÅds Ltd 2006, , pages 35-37. The current railway stations in J≈´rmala, sorted from east to west, are Priedaine, Lielupe, Bulduri, Dzintari, Majori, Dubulti, Jaundubulti, Pumpuri, Mellu≈æi, Asari, Vaivari, Sloka and ƒ∂emeri. = Roads = A six lane road, designated A10 and E22, connects Riga to J≈´rmala. A road toll is required from non-residents to pass the 4-lane bridge over Lielupe (build in 1962) and drive into J≈´rmala. A railway overpass was built at Dzintari Station in 1976, giving a fast four-lane traffic flow into central J≈´rmala. = Air = Riga International Airport is only 18 km from central J≈´rmala (Majori). Confusingly, J≈´rmala Airport, a former Soviet air base, is further away (39 km) from central J≈´rmala, near Tukums.http://jurmalaairport.com// Demographics As of 1 January 2019, the city had a population of 49,325.

It is the largest city in the Kurzeme Region and the third largest city in the country after Riga and Daugavpils. It is an important ice- free port. In 2019 the population of LiepƒÅja was 68,945 people. In the 19th and early 20th century, it was a favourite place for sea-bathers, with the town boasting a fine park, many pretty gardens and a theatre.Murray, 1875, p.85. LiepƒÅja is however known throughout Latvia as \\"City where the wind is born\\", likely because of the constant sea breeze. A song of the same name () was composed by Imants Kalni≈Ü≈° and has become the anthem of the city. Its reputation as the windiest city in Latvia was strengthened with the construction of the largest wind farm in the nation (33 Enercon wind turbines) nearby. The coat of arms of LiepƒÅja was adopted four days after the jurisdiction gained city rights on 18 March 1625. These are described as: \\"on a silver background, the lion of Courland with a divided tail, who leans upon a linden () tree with its forelegs\\". The flag of LiepƒÅja has the coat of arms in the center, with red in the top half and green in the bottom. One of the very few surviving films documenting the mass murder of Jews during the first stages of the Holocaust is a short film by a German soldier who witnessed the massacre of LiepƒÅja Jews in July 1941 near the city's lighthouse. Names and toponymy It is said that the first settlement at the location of modern LiepƒÅja was known by the name Lƒ´va from the name of the river Lƒ´va on which LiepƒÅja was located. The name was derived from the Livonian word Liiv meaning \\"sand\\". The oldest written text mentioning Lƒ´va village (Villa Liva) is the treaty of bishop of Courland and the master of the Livonian Order dated 4 April 1253. In 1263, the Teutonic Order established a town which they called Libau in German. The Latvian name LiepƒÅja was mentioned for the first time in 1649 by Paul Einhorn in his work Historia Lettica. A Russian name from the time of the Russian Empire was (Libava) or (Libau), although (Liepaya), a transliteration of LiepƒÅja, has been used since World War II. Some other names for the city include Liepoja in Lithuanian, Lipawa in Polish and (Libaveh) in Yiddish. History=Early history= It is said that the original settlement at the location of modern LiepƒÅja was founded by Curonian fishermen from Piemare as Lƒ´va, but Henry (Henricus Lettus) of Livonia, in his famous Chronicle, makes no mention of the settlement. The Teutonic Order established a town which they called Libau here in 1263, followed by Mitau two years later. In 1418 the village was sacked and burned by the Lithuanians.Turnbull, Stephen, Tannenberg 1410, Osprey Publishing, Oxford UK, 2003, p.82: Certainly Poland & Lithuania invaded Prussia again in 1422, but no mentions of Libau. =Livonian confederation= During the 15th century, a part of the trade route from Amsterdam to Moscow passed through Lƒ´va, where it was known as the \\"white road to Lyva portus\\". By 1520 the river Lƒ´va had become too shallow for easy navigation, and development of the city declined. = Duchy of Courland and Semigallia = In 1560, Gotthard Kettler, first Duke of Courland and Semigallia, loaned all the Grobi≈Üa district, including Libau, to Albert, Duke of Prussia for 50,000 guldens. Only in 1609 after the marriage of Sofie Hohenzollern, Princess of Prussia, to Wilhelm Kettler did the territory return to the Duchy. During the Livonian War, Libau was attacked and burnt by the Swedes. In 1625, Duke Friedrich Kettler of Courland granted the town city rights, which were affirmed by King Sigismund III of Poland in 1626, although under what legal authority Sigismund had is debatable. Under Duke Jacob Kettler (1642‚Äì1681), Libau became one of the main ports of Courland as it reached the height of its prosperity. In 1637 Couronian colonization was started from the ports of Libau and Ventspils (Windau). Kettler was an eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and ship building became much more developed, and trading relations developed not only with nearby countries but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. In 1697‚Äì1703 a canal was cut to the sea and a more modern port was built. In 1701, during the Great Northern War, Libau was captured by Charles XII of Sweden, but by the end of the war, the city had returned to titular Polish possession. In 1710 an epidemic of plague killed about a third of the population. In 1780 the first Freemasonry lodge, \\"Libanons,\\" was established by Provincial Grand Master Ivan Yelagin on behalf of the Provincial Lodge of Russia; it was registered as number 524 in the Grand Lodge of England. = Russian Empire = Courland passed to the control of the Russian Empire in 1795 during the third Partition of Poland and was organized as the Courland Governorate of Russia. Growth during the nineteenth century was rapid. During the Crimean War, when the British Royal Navy was blockading Russian Baltic ports, the busy yet still an unfortified port of Libau was briefly captured on 17 May 1854 without a shot being fired, by a landing party of 110 men from HMS Conflict and HMS Amphion. In 1857 an Imperial Decree provided for a new railway to Libau,Palmer, Alan, Northern Shores, London, 2005, p.215. and the same year the engineer Jan Heidatel developed a project to reconstruct the port. In 1861‚Äì1868 the project was realized ‚Äì including the building of a lighthouse and breakwaters. Between 1877‚Äì1882 the political and literary weekly newspaper LiepƒÅjas Pastnieks was published ‚Äì the first Latvian language newspaper in Libau. In the 1870s the further rapid development of Russian railways, especially the 1871 opening of the Libava-Kaunas and the 1876 LiepƒÅja‚ÄìRomny Railways, ensured that a large proportion of central Russian trade passed through Libau. By 1900, 7% of Russian exports were passing through Libau. The city became a major port of the Russian Empire on the Baltic Sea, as well as a popular resort. During this time of economic expansion, the city architect Paul Max Bertschy provided the design for many of the city's both public and private buildings, making an imprint on the architecture which can still be seen today. On the orders of Alexander III, Libau was fortified against possible German attacks. Fortifications were subsequently built around the city, and in the early 20th century, a major military base was established on the northern edge. It included formidable coastal fortifications and extensive quarters for military personnel. As part of the military development, a separate port was excavated for exclusively military use. This area became known as Kara Osta (War Port) and served military needs throughout the twentieth century. Early in the twentieth century, the port of Libau became a central point of embarkation for immigrants travelling to the United States and Canada. By 1906 the direct ship service to the United States was used by 40,000 migrants per year. Simultaneously, the first Russian training school of submarine navigation was founded. In 1912 one of the first water aerodromes in Russia was opened in Libau. In 1913, 1,738 ships entered Libau, with 1,548,119 tonnes of cargo passing through the port. The population had increased from 10,000 to over 100,000 within about 60 years. = World War I and War of Independence = Libau's 5 rubles (1915) Following the outbreak of World War I, the German cruiser SMS Magdeburg shelled Libau, and other vessels laid mines off the approaches to the port.Palmer, 2005, p.255 Libau was soon occupied by the German Army, on 7 May 1915, and in memory of this event, a monument was constructed on K≈´rmƒÅjas Prospect in 1916 (destroyed by Bolsheviks in 1919). Libau's local government issued its own money for a while in this period ‚Äì Libaua rubles. Advanced German Zeppelin base was constructed at Vai≈Üode, near LiepƒÅja, with five hangars, in August 1915.Palmer, 2005, p.258. On 23 October 1915, the German cruiser was sunk by the British submarine , west of Libau. With the collapse of Russia and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the occupying German forces had a quiet time, but the subsequent collapse of the German Empire and the Allied denunciation of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty changed everything. Independence of the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed on 18 November 1918, and the Latvian Provisional Government under Karlis Ulmanis was created. Bolshevik Russia now advanced into Latvian territory and met little resistance here. Soon the Provisional Government and remaining German units were forced to leave Riga and retreated all the way to LiepƒÅja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the Venta river. The Latvian Soviet Republic was announced. Latvia now became the main theatre of Baltic operations for the remaining German forces in 1919. In addition, a Landeswehr was formed to work in conjunction with the German forces. In LiepƒÅja, a coup organized by Germans took place on 16 April 1919 and Ulmanis government was forced to flee and was replaced by Andrievs Niedra. The Ulmanis government found shelter on the steamship \\"Saratov\\" in LiepƒÅja port. In May a British cruiser squadron arrived at Libau to support Latvian independence and requested the Germans to leave.Hiden, John, and Salmon, Patrick, The Baltic Nations and Europe, Longman Group UK Ltd., 1991, p.32-6. During the war, the words of \\"The J√§ger March\\" were written in Libau by Heikki Nurmio. The German Freikorps, having recaptured Riga from the Bolsheviks, departed in late 1919 and, with some Polish assistance, the Bolsheviks were driven out of the Latvian hinterlands in early 1920. = 1920‚Äì1940 = During the interwar period, LiepƒÅja was the second major city in Latvia. In an attempt to put Libau 'on the map', on 31 January 1922, the Libau Bank was founded with significant new capital, transforming the old Libau Exchange Bank which had belonged to the Libau Exchange Association, and it eventually became the fourth largest of Latvia's joint stock banks. However, when a Riga branch of the bank was opened, the business centre of gravity shifted from LiepƒÅja so that by 1923 its Riga 'branch' was responsible for 90% of the turnover. The German consul in LiepƒÅja reported at the time that \\"Riga, the economic heart of the country, draws all business to itself.\\" The Latvian government ignored the pleas of the Libau Exchange Association to frustrate this.Hiden, John, The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik, Cambridge University Press, UK, 1987, p.101-3. In 1935 KOD () started to manufacture the light aircraft KOD-1 and KOD-2 at LiepƒÅja. However it became evident in this year that trade with the new Soviet Union had virtually collapsed.Hiden & Salmon, 1991, p.78. = World War II = Top secret USSR document about creating a closed military port in LiepƒÅja. Signed by Stalin (note: there is a spelling mistake in the word \\"LiepƒÅja\\" ‚Äì ') (1951) The ports and human capital of LiepƒÅja and Ventspils were targets of Joseph Stalin. He signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop pact in part to gain control of this territory. When the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Latvia in 1940, it nationalized private property. Many thousands of former owners were arrested and deported to the gulag camps in Siberia. In 1941 LiepƒÅja was among the first cities captured by the 291st Infantry Division of Army Group North after Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa, its war against the Soviet Union. German Nazis and Latvian collaborators virtually exterminated the local Jewish population, which had numbered about 7,000 before the war. Film footage of an Einsatzgruppen execution of local Jews was taken in LiepƒÅja. Most of these mass murders took place in the dunes of ≈†ƒ∑ƒìde north of the city. Fewer than thirty Jews survived in LiepƒÅja by the end of the war. During the war, the German navy's U-boat crews received their torpedo training at LiepƒÅja. During the period 1944‚Äì1945, as the Soviet Union began its offensive to the Baltic Sea, LiepƒÅja was within the \\"Courland Pocket\\". It was occupied by the Red Army on 9 May 1945. Thousands of Latvians fled as refugees to Germany. The city had been devastated during the war, and most of the buildings and industrial plant were destroyed. = Latvian SSR = On 25‚Äì29 March 1949, the Soviet Union organized a second mass deportation to Siberia from LiepƒÅja. In 1950 a monument to Stalin was erected on Station square (). It was dismantled in 1958 after the Party Congress that discussed his abuses. During 1953‚Äì1957 the city center was reconstructed under the direction of architects A. Kruglov and M. ≈Ωagare. In 1952‚Äì1955 the LiepƒÅja Academy of Pedagogy building was constructed under the direction of A. Aivars. In 1960 the Kurzeme shopping centre was opened. During the Soviet administration, LiepƒÅja was a closed city; even local farmers and villagers needed a special permit to enter it. The Soviet military set up its Baltic naval base and nuclear weapon warehouses there; The Beberli≈Ü≈° sandpit was dug out to extract sand used for constructing underground warehouses. In 1967 the Soviets completely closed the port to commercial traffic. One-third of the city was taken up with a Soviet naval base; its military staff numbered 26,000. The 14th Submarine Squadron of the USSR's Baltic Fleet (', call sign \\"–ö–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å\\") was stationed there with 16 submarines (Types: 613, 629a, 651); as was the 6th group of Rear Supply of the Baltic Fleet, and the 81st Design Bureau and Reserve Command Center of the same force. In 1977 LiepƒÅja was awarded the Order of the October Revolution for heroic defense against Nazi Germany in 1941. Five residents were awarded the honorary title Hero of Socialist Labor: Anatolijs Filatkins, Art≈´rs Fridrihsons, VoldemƒÅrs Lazdups, Valentins ≈†uvajevs and Otƒ´lija ≈Ωagata. Because of the rapid growth of the city's population, a shortage of apartment houses resulted. To resolve this, the Soviet government organized development of most of the modern LiepƒÅja districts: Dienvidrietumi, Ezerkrasts, Ziemeƒºu priek≈°pilsƒìta, ZaƒºƒÅ birze and Tosmare. The majority of these blocks were constructed of ferro-concrete panels in standard projects designed by the state Latgyprogorstroy Institute ('). In 1986 the new central city hospital in Zaƒºa birze was opened. Soviet-era apartment blocks in LiepƒÅja = 1990‚Äìpresent = After Latvia regained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, LiepƒÅja has worked hard to change from a military city into a modern port city (again appearing on European maps after the secrecy of the Soviet period). The commercial port was re-opened in 1991, and in 1994 the last Russian troops left LiepƒÅja. Since then, LiepƒÅja has engaged in international co-operation, has been associated with 10 twin and partner cities, and is an active partner in several co-operation networks. Facilities are being improved. The city is the location of Latvia's largest naval flotilla, the largest warehouses of ammunition and weapons in the Baltic states, and the main supply centre of the Latvian army. The former closed military town has been transformed into the northern neighbourhood of Karosta, occupying a third of the area of the city of LiepƒÅja and attracting tourists to the remains of the military era.LiepƒÅja Naval Port At the beginning of the 21st century, many ambitious construction projects were planned for the city, including a NATO military base, and Baltic Sea Park, planned as the biggest amusement park in the Baltic states. Most of the projects have not yet been realised due to economic and political factors. LiepƒÅja's heating network was renovated with the cooperation of French and Russian companies: Dalkia and Gazprom, respectively. In 2006, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, a direct descendant of Jacob Kettler visited LiepƒÅja. In 2010 the coal cogeneration 400 MW power plant was built in LiepƒÅja with the support of the government.  Climate  Liepaja's temperature and precipitation distribution LiepƒÅja enjoys a semi-continental climate noted as \\"Dfb\\" in the K√∂ppen classification. The major factor influencing the weather in the region is the Baltic Sea, providing a relatively mild winter for its high latitude (although snowy) and relatively cool summer. During the winter the sea around LiepƒÅja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some land-fast ice may develop, it seldom reaches a hundred meters from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea warms up fully only at the beginning of August, so the best bathing season in LiepƒÅja is from August to September. Summers are more affected by the maritime climate than east-facing cities on similar latitudes in opposite Sweden, but winters are milder than inland areas to the east. Regular meteorological observations in the city have been conducted since 1857. * Average temperatures: : February: : July: * Absolute minimum of temperature: * Absolute maximum of temperature: * Number of sunny days per year: 196 * Average speed of wind: 5.8 m/s (13 mph) * Average annual norm of precipitation (mostly rain): * Typical wind directions: in the winter ‚Äì southern, in the summer ‚Äì western.  Geography  Beach in LiepƒÅja LiepƒÅja is situated on the coast of the Baltic Sea in the south-western part of Latvia. The westernmost geographical point of Latvia is located approximately to the south thus making LiepƒÅja Latvia's furthest west city. LiepƒÅja is situated between the Baltic Sea and LiepƒÅja Lake with residential and industrial areas spreading north of the lake. The Trade Channel () connects the lake to the sea dividing the city into southern and northern parts, which are often referred to as the Old Town () and the New Town () respectively. The city center is located in the southern part and, although called the Old Town, is relatively more developed. Most of the administrative and cultural buildings are found here as well as the main leisure areas. Along the coast, the city extends northwards until it reaches the Karosta Channel (). North of the Karosta Channel is an area called Karosta which is now fully integrated into LiepƒÅja and is the northernmost district of the city. LiepƒÅja's coastline consists of an unbroken sandy beach and dunes as does most of Latvia's coastline. The beach of LiepƒÅja is not as exploited as other places (e.g. the Gulf of Riga, J≈´rmala and P√§rnu in Estonia) but also lacks the tourist infrastructure needed for a fashionable, modern resort. = J≈´rmala Park = J≈´rmala Park (Seaside Park) is located in the western part of the city at the seaside. The park is long with a total area of 70 ha and is one of the largest planted parks in Latvia. It was developed at the end of the 19th century. At the end of Peldu Street are Latvia's largest drums ‚Äì one of the objects of LiepƒÅja's environmental design which reminds one that LiepƒÅja is the music capital of Latvia. The open-air concert stage P≈´t, vƒìji≈Üi! (Blow, wind, blow!) was built in 1964. It has been the venue for a good many concerts and festivals, with the festival \\"LiepƒÅjas Dzintars\\" (\\"Amber of LiepƒÅja\\") being the most famous among them, as it could be regarded as the oldest rock festival of the former Soviet Union. It was held for the first time in 1968. Alongside the stage is an interesting building, the former Bath House built in 1902 and designed by Max Paul Bertschy. At the beginning of the 19th century, LiepƒÅja was a renowned health resort and the Russian tsar and his family had been visiting LiepƒÅja. This all encouraged other aristocrats from Russia and Europe to spend their summers in LiepƒÅja as well. = Libava fortress = At the beginning of the 20th century, Libava fortress was the most expensive and ambitious project of the Russian army on the Baltic Sea. The massive concrete fortifications with eight cannon batteries were built to protect the city and its population from German attacks. The fortress' secret underground passages figure heavily in the city's most famous urban legends. = Districts = # VecliepƒÅja # Ezerkrasts # Dienvidrietumu rajons # Ziemeƒºu priek≈°pilsƒìta # JaunliepƒÅja # Velnciems # Karosta # Tosmare # ZaƒºƒÅ birze # JaunƒÅ pasaule = Suburbs = # Aucugals # Grƒ´nvalti # Pƒìrkone # Cimdenieki # Kapsƒìde # ≈†ƒ∑ƒìde = Closest cities = The closest city to LiepƒÅja is Grobi≈Üa, located about away towards Riga. Other main cities in the region are Klaipƒóda (approx. to the south), Ventspils (approx. to the north) and Saldus (approx. to the east). The distance to Riga (the capital of Latvia) is about to the east. The nearest point to LiepƒÅja across the Baltic sea is the Swedish island of Gotland approximately to the north-west. The distance to Stockholm is 216 nautical miles.  Architecture and sightseeing  LiepƒÅja is rich in different architecture styles: wooden houses, Art Nouveau buildings, Soviet-era apartments and a number of green parks all contribute to the character of the city. The main areas of interest for tourists include the city center with its many churches, the Seaside park with white sandy beaches and the northern suburb of Karosta, a former secret military encampment which is now a major tourist attraction. Other areas of interest for tourists are VecliepƒÅja; Ezerkrasts, which is close to LiepƒÅja lake; and the Karosta beaches with their picturesque blasted forts. = Monuments and memorials = * Monument to the sailors and fishermen lost at sea ‚Äì 1977 * Monument to the Defenders of LiepƒÅja in 1941‚Äì1960 * Monument to 1919 Freedom Fighters * Monument to Mirdza ƒ∂empe ‚Äì 1989 * Monument to ƒívalds Rimbenieks ‚Äì 2008 * Memorial wall in ZaƒºƒÅ birze * Nikolay Dedaev Monument * Statue of Hermes (LielƒÅ iela 10) * 1 Rock Caf√© Guitar * The Amber clock  Former monuments  * Monument to Imants Sudmalis ‚Äì 1978 (partially dismantled and relocated) * Monument to Lenin ‚Äì 1970 (dismantled) * Monument to Nelson Stepanyan (relocated to Kaliningrad) * Monument to the 11 sailors of Soviet submarine L-3 (relocated to Moscow) * Monument to the submariners of the Baltic Sea (partially dismantled) = Museums = * The LiepƒÅja Museum * Department of Liepaja Museum \\"Liepaja during the occupational regimes\\" * Museum \\"History of LiepƒÅja Community of Jews\\" * Museum \\"LiepƒÅjas Metalurgs\\" (founded in 2007) * Museum \\"Karosta Prison\\" = Churches = * St. Paul's Baptist Church (1895) * St. Anna's Lutheran Church (1587) * LiepƒÅja Holy Trinity Lutheran Cathedral (1758) * St. Joseph's Catholic Cathedral (1762) * Holy Trinity Orthodox Church (1867) * St Nicholas Naval Cathedral, Karosta (1901‚Äì1903) * St. Meinhard's church = Notable buildings = * Rose square () * Swan Pond (remnant of river Lƒ´va) * Hotel \\"Libava\\" * Peter The Great house ‚Äì the oldest house in LiepƒÅja * Graudu 45 ‚Äì Graudu nams (Jugendstil) * Graudu 42 ‚Äì former \\"Bonic Caf√©\\" * Great Amber Concert Hall () * Pƒìtertirgus ‚Äì Central market * LiepƒÅjas teatris * City council building ‚Äì former District court * Restaurant \\"Vecais Kapteins\\" * University of LiepƒÅja building * 1st Latvian Rock Caf√©  Transport  Public transport in LiepƒÅja The urban transport network of LiepƒÅja relies mainly on buses and minicoaches. there are 12 bus routes and 5 minibus routes in LiepƒÅja. The city also has a single two-way tram line running through some parts of the city from north-east to south-west, which also provides a vital transport link. The tram line was founded after the opening of the first LiepƒÅja power plant in 1899, which makes it the oldest electric tram line in the Baltic states; it is now operated by the municipal company LiepƒÅjas tramvajs. The Port of LiepƒÅja has a wide water area and consists of three main parts. The Winter harbour is located in the Trade channel and serves small local fishing vessels as well as medium cargo ships. Immediately north of the Trade channel is the main area of the port, separated from the open sea by a line of breakwaters. This part of the port can accommodate large ships and ferries. Further north is Karosta harbour, also called Karosta channel, which was formerly a military harbour but is now used for ship repairs and other commercial purposes. LiepƒÅja also welcomes yachts and other leisure vessels which can enter the Trade channel and moor almost in the center of the city. LiepƒÅja has a railway connection to Jelgava and Riga and through them to the rest of Latvia's railway network. There is just one passenger station in the New town, but the railway extends further and links to the port. There is also a northward railway track leading to Ventspils, but in recent decades it has fallen into disuse for economic reasons. The railway provides the main means of delivering cargo to the port. Two main highways, the A9 and A11, connect the city and its port to the rest of the country. The A9 leads north-west towards Riga and central Latvia and the A11 leads south to the border with Lithuania and its only port Klaipƒóda and to Palanga International Airport. The city also hosts LiepƒÅja International Airport, one of three international airports in Latvia; it is located outside the city limits, north of the Lake of LiepƒÅja near Cimdenieki. The airport is serviced by charter flights and an Air Baltic connection to Riga International Airport.  Communications  Communication systems in LiepƒÅja are well-developed. The city is connected to the global Internet by three optical lines owned by Lattelecom, TeliaSonera International Carrier and Latvenergo and a radio relay line owned by LVRTC. There are four Lattelecom telephone exchanges and the LVRTC TV station and tower, which transmits four national TV channels, two local TV channels ‚Äî \\"TV Dzintare\\" and \\"TV Kurzeme\\" and six radio stations. It has two local cable TV operators with a total number of subscribers about 15000 and three local ISPs. The city also has its own amateur radio community and a citywide wireless video monitoring system. , digital terrestrial television is fully operational; mobile television and broadband wireless networks are ready for implementation. All four Latvian mobile operators have stable zones of coverage (GSM 900/1800, UMTS, 2100 CDMA450) and client service centers in LiepƒÅja. The city also has fourteen post offices as well as DHL, UPS and DPD depots.  Economy  Men fish alongside the Tirdzniecƒ´bas KanƒÅls (Trade Canal) In the second half of the 20th century under Soviet rule LiepƒÅja became an industrial city and numerous high technology plants were founded, including: > # Mashzavod () # Liepajselmash () ‚Äì 1954 (now Hidrolats) # Sarkanais > Metalurgs (now LiepƒÅjas Metalurgs) # SRZ-29 () (now Tosmares kuƒ£u b≈´vƒìtava) > # LBORF () ‚Äì 1964 # Bolshevik () ‚Äì 1949 (now Kursa) # Perambulator factory > \\"LiepƒÅja\\" () # Mixed fodder plant () # Sugar plant () # Match factory > \\"Baltija\\" () ‚Äì 1957 # Ferro-concrete constructions plant () ‚Äì 1959 # Oil > extraction plant () # SU-426 of BMGS () (now BMGS) # Lauma () ‚Äì 1972 # > Linoleum plant # Shoes factory After the collapse of USSR's centrally planned economy, only some of these plants continue to operate. Within Latvia LiepƒÅja is well known mostly by coffee brand LiepƒÅjas kafija, beer Lƒ´vu alus and sugar LiepƒÅjas cukurs. In 1997 the Liepaja Special Economic Zone was established for 20 years providing a low tax environment in order to attract foreign investments and facilitate the economic development of LiepƒÅja, but investment growth remained slow due to a shortage of skilled labour force. The main industries in LiepƒÅja are the steel producer LiepƒÅjas Metalurgs, building firm UPB and the underwear brand Lauma. The economy of LiepƒÅja relies heavily on its port which accepts a wide range of cargo. The most notable companies working in Liepaja's port are Baltic Transshipment Center, LiepƒÅjas Osta LM, Laskana, Astramar and Terrabalt. After joining the European Union in 2004, most of LiepƒÅja companies were faced with strict European rules and terse competition and was forced to stop production or to sell enterprises to European companies. In 2007 LiepƒÅjas cukurfabrika and LiepƒÅjas sƒìrkoci≈Üi closed down; Lƒ´vu alus, LiepƒÅjas maiznieks and Lauma have been sold to European investors.

Many famous composers and bands have been inspired by LiepƒÅja, including Lƒ´vi, Credo, 2xBBM and Tumsa. In the center of LiepƒÅja there was the first Latvian Rock Caf√© (now bankrupt) and the Latvian Musician's Walk of Fame. The oldest pop music festival in Latvia, LiepƒÅjas Dzintars was held in LiepƒÅja from 1964 to 2006 presenting bands from Baltic states as well as internationally famous guests.

It is privately owned and employs approximately 2,300 people worldwide. It is perhaps best known among consumers for its duty-free retail stores in airports and border crossings in Australasia and the Middle East. The company is a household name in Israel due to its duty-free stores in Terminal 3 of Ben Gurion Airport. History Scottish-born James Richardson (c. 1864‚Äì1951) immigrated from Ayrshire to New South Wales in 1886 and worked at the Wentworth Hotel, Sydney before relocating to Melbourne as a barman at Hotel Windsor. By July 1916 Richardson was the proprietor of two wine and spirits stores in Melbourne. In 1928 he commissioned the building of the Hotel Alexander, which became the seventh in his hotel chain and along with his four wine and spirit shops made him \\"the biggest figure in Australia's hotel trade.\\" He sold off five hotels in 1944 and when he died in August 1951 he was \\"worth approximately ¬£2 million.\\" Duty-free retail=Australia and New Zealand= Eight duty-free stores in Australia and three in New Zealand operate under the trade name JR/Duty Free. Seven are located inside international airports and four in major city centres. James Richardson first began duty-free retailing in Australia in 1972, opening a single store at Brisbane Airport. The company expanded over the next two decades, opening further duty-free stores in Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport, Perth Airport and Cairns Airport, and twenty-three stores in all major city centres. The company sold this entire operation to Swissair in 1995, choosing instead to concentrate on the furniture and textiles business and the company's Israeli duty-free retail operation. Ten years later, the company, this time trading under its current trade name, JR/Duty Free, again reentered the Australian market, opening city centre duty-free stores in Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, and later Brisbane, and winning a ten-year concession to operate at Darwin Airport from February 2007. In 2009, JR/Duty Free was awarded one of the available duty-free concessions in Auckland Airport in New Zealand, and purchased the duty-free concession at Wellington International Airport from a rival firm. Both operations commenced in July of that year, and in 2010, another store opened in Christchurch International Airport. Over the last few years, JR/Duty Free has continued to expand, reopening stores in Cairns Airport in March 2012, Perth Airport in November 2013, and most recently, Brisbane Airport in September 2014. =Israel= James Richardson Duty Free store in the airside rotunda of Ben Gurion Airport Terminal 3, Israel, May 2006 In 1987, the Israel Airports Authority issued a tender for a total area of more than 1,000 square metres (of retail space) (at Ben Gurion Airport). Five companies bid for the tender and James Richardson was the winner. The company stores in Israel officially opened on 14 November 1988. The company has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars (into the venture), including a new store with an 800-square metre cosmetics and perfume area, a 300-square metre consumer electronics area, a 150-square metre watch store and a 150-square metre fashion area. Turnover has increased continuously since the start of operations. Total sales in the first year were about 20 million US dollars, while in recent years the total sales in Israel today is over 400 million: an increase of about 2,000% in 20 years. There are now eight James Richardson duty-free stores in Terminal 3 of Ben-Gurion Airport. In addition, James Richardson operates duty-free stores at the Allenby Bridge border crossing with Jordan, the Taba Border Crossing with Egypt, and operates at the ports of Haifa and Ashdod - including providing supplies for ships crews, and warehouses for supplies for UN forces and diplomats. The company also operates a store in Haifa Airport, in cruise ships of the Israeli cruise line Mano, and the duty-free carts on Arkia and Israir flights. In 1989, James Richardson pioneered a shopping storage and pickup service, which led to increased sales and was subsequently adopted by the company in its other stores in Australia and New Zealand. The service was the brainchild of Ze'ev Sarig, then responsible for security at Ben Gurion Airport (and later became its managing director). The idea came to him after buying a bottle of whiskey on his way abroad. The service allows passengers to make duty-free purchases before leaving the country, store them at the airport, and receive them upon their return. The service was first implemented in August 1989, and within two months it had already been used by some 8,000 passengers. =Other= James Richardson has an interest in Tahiti Duty Free located within Fa'a'ƒÅ International Airport in Tahiti.

Some portions of the immune system itself have immunosuppressive effects on other parts of the immune system, and immunosuppression may occur as an adverse reaction to treatment of other conditions. In general, deliberately induced immunosuppression is performed to prevent the body from rejecting an organ transplant. Additionally, it is used for treating graft- versus-host disease after a bone marrow transplant, or for the treatment of auto-immune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, or Crohn's disease. This is typically done using medications, but may involve surgery (splenectomy), plasmapheresis, or radiation. A person who is undergoing immunosuppression, or whose immune system is weak for some other reasons (chemotherapy or HIV), is said to be immunocompromised. Deliberately induced Azathioprine White blood cells (and red blood cells) Administration of immunosuppressive medications or immunosuppressants is the main method of deliberately induced immunosuppression, in optimal circumstances, immunosuppressive drugs are targeted only at any hyperactive component of the immune system People with previous cancer who require immunosuppression are not more likely to have a recurrence, throughout its history, radiation therapy has been used to decrease the strength of the immune system. Dr. Joseph Murray of Brigham and Women's Hospital, was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 for work on immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive drugs have the potential to cause immunodeficiency, which can cause increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and decreased cancer immunosurveillance. Immunosuppressants may be prescribed when a normal immune response is undesirable, such as in autoimmune diseases. Steroids were the first immunosuppressant identified, but its side-effects limited its use, the more specific azathioprine was identified in 1960, but it was the discovery of ciclosporin in 1980 (together with azathioprine) that allowed significant expansion of transplantation to less well-matched donor-recipient pairs as well as broad application to lung transplantation, pancreas transplantation, and heart transplantation. After an organ transplantation, the body will nearly always reject the new organ(s) due to differences in human leukocyte antigen between the donor and recipient. As a result, the immune system detects the new tissue as \\"foreign\\", and attempts to remove it by attacking it with white blood cells, resulting in the death of the donated tissue, immunosuppressants are given as an attempt to prevent this rejection; the side-effect is that the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and malignancy. Non-deliberate immunosuppression Leukemia Non-deliberate immunosuppression can occur in, for example, ataxia‚Äìtelangiectasia, complement deficiencies, many types of cancer, and certain chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The unwanted effect in non-deliberate immunosuppression is immunodeficiency that results in increased susceptibility to pathogens such as bacteria, and viruses Immunodeficiency is also a potential adverse effect of many immunosuppressant drugs, in this sense, the scope of the term immunosuppression in general includes both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system B cell deficiency and T cell deficiency are immune impairment that individuals are born with or are acquired, which in turn can lead to immunodeficiency problems (Nezelof syndrome is an example of an immunodeficiency of T-cells.).
