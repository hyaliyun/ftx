It was founded in 1927 in Nuremberg- Kleinreuth at the former Broadcast Street 24, now Sigmund Street 181, in order to supply the northern areas of Bavaria with broadcast programs in the medium- wave band. Antenna Between 1927 and 1935 this plant's transmission antenna was a T-antenna, which was spun between two freestanding steel framework towers. In 1935 this antenna was replaced by a tower http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?buildingID=47071 built of wood, which became available at the change of the antenna system at transmitter Ismaning in 1934 and which was rebuilt in Nuremberg-Kleinreuth after its disassembly. On April 6, 1950, a guyed mast radiator went into service at Nuremberg- Kleinreuth. The now dispensable wood tower was demolished on July 12, 1961, due to decay. Closure On September 15, 1969, the Nuremberg-Kleinreuth broadcasting station was shut down, after the radio mast at Dillberg had been equipped with a cage aerial for medium wave transmission and thus could overtake the function of the transmitter Nuremberg-Kleinreuth. In 1973 the area of the transmitting plant was sold to the company Theisen KG, which allowed the remaining installations of the abandoned transmitter be demolished in order to build a factory hall there.

He set the US high school national record for the 10,000 meters when he ran 28:32 in 1976. Chapa was one of the most versatile distance runners, with a remarkable competitive range from the 1500 meters to the marathon. He is the son of Mexican immigrants. His father Rodolfo Sr. came to the US as a mechanic through the Bracero program.Oregon Hall of Fame Running career = High school = While attending Hammond High School in Hammond, Indiana, Rudy Chapa won the cross-country state championship twice in a row. The first time was in 1974, tying for 1st place in a time of 11:59.8 (2.5 miles) with fellow schoolmate Carey Pinkowski. The second came in 1975 with a time of 11:46.3 (2.5 miles). It was during his high school years that he formed part of a trio of runners from his school that all broke 9:00 minutes in the two-mile run, which he, Carey Pinkowski, and Tim Keough did in 1975. This feat has only been repeated by the boys of Northport high school of New York where 3 boys each broke 9 minutes for the 2-mile run in the same race at the New Balance outdoor national meet, although 2 of its 3 runners were twin brothers. In 1976, Chapa first gained fame as one of the U.S.A.'s great high school distance runners, setting the still-standing national high school record in the 10,000 meters, in 28:321. That same year he also won the Indiana state mile in 4:04.20, a time that held the state meet record until 2011, when it was broken by Center Grove's Austin Mudd in a competitive race with Carmel High School's Chris Walden and Westfield High School's Connor Martin. = Collegiate = After high school graduation he went out west to run for Bill Dellinger's famous University of Oregon track and field team at Hayward Field. He went on to earn All American status six times in cross country and track and was a member of Oregon's 1977 national champion cross country team. In 1978 he won the NCAA championship in 5,000 meters while running in front of his home crowd in Oregon. The next year he broke the American Record (AR) in the 3,000 meters at Hayward Field as well, running a time of 7:37.7 to break Steve Prefontaine's AR by five seconds. On May 28, 1981, Chapa joined the sub 4:00-mile club when he ran a 3:57.04-mile in Eugene. While at Oregon he became friends with future marathon world record holder, Alberto Salazar, another Hispanic American distance runner. = Post-collegiate = After graduating from Oregon, Chapa attended Indiana Law School. While he won some local road races (such as the Sports Med 10K in 29:21 and the Double Eagle 10-Miler in 48:08 in October 1983) Chapa's only performance of note after leaving Oregon came in the 1983 New York City Marathon when he ran a time of 2:11:13 (for 7th place), the second fastest American marathon debut at the time (behind Salazar's 2:09:41 at New York in 1980). In 1999 he was inducted into the University of Oregon athletics Hall of Fame² and was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. After his athletic career, Chapa first served as the global director of sports marketing at Nike, Inc.

Invention  It was invented as 'emerald green' in 1814 by two chemists, Russ and Sattler, at the Wilhelm Dye and White Lead Company of Schweinfurt, Bavaria. They were attempting to produce an improved pigment over Scheele's green, particularly so that it was longer-lasting and less susceptible to darkening around sulfides. When they published the recipe in 1822, its toxicity became obvious. Despite this, like Scheele's green, it continued to be involved in poisoning accidents. Uses =Insecticide= In 1867, farmers in Illinois and Indiana found that Paris green was effective against the Colorado potato beetle, an aggressive agricultural pest. Despite concerns regarding the safety of using arsenic compounds on food crops, Paris green became the preferred method for controlling the beetle. By the 1880s, Paris green had become the first widespread use of a chemical insecticide in the world.Sorenson 1995 It was also used widely in the Americas to control the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens. Paris green was heavily sprayed by airplane in Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica during 1944 and in Italy in 1945 to control malaria. It was once used to kill rats in Parisian sewers, which is how it acquired its common name.The Natural Paint Book, by Lynn Edwards, Julia Lawless, Table of contents =Pigment= Paris green, also called emerald green, was a popular pigment used in artists' paints by (among others) the English painter W. Turner, Impressionists such as Monet and Renoir, and Post-Impressionists such as Gauguin, Cézanne, and Van Gogh.Emerald green, Colourlex Related pigments Similar natural compounds are the minerals chalcophyllite ·36, conichalcite , cornubite ·, cornwallite ·, and liroconite ·4. These vivid minerals range from greenish blue to slightly yellowish green. Scheele's green is a chemically simpler, less brilliant, and less permanent, synthetic copper- arsenic pigment used for a rather short time before Paris green was first prepared, which was approximately 1814. It was popular as a wallpaper pigment and would degrade, with moisture and molds, to arsine gas. Paris green was also used in wallpaper to some extent and may have also degraded similarly.Atlas Obscura, \\"How a Library Handles a Rare and Deadly Book of Wallpaper Samples\\" Both pigments were once used in printing ink formulations. The ancient Romans used one of them, possibly conichalcite, as a green pigment. The Paris green paint used by the Impressionists is said to have been composed of relatively coarse particles. Later, the chemical was produced with increasingly small grinds and without carefully removing impurities; its permanence suffered. It is likely that it was ground more finely for use in watercolors and inks, too. See also * List of colors * List of inorganic pigments References Further reading * Fiedler, I. and Bayard, M.

A symplesiomorphy ( from syn- “together”) is a plesiomorphy shared by two or more taxa (including taxa earlier in the clade). Pseudoplesiomorphy is any trait that can neither be identified as a plesiomorphy nor as an apomorphy. Alternative terms are plesiomorphic character and symplesiomorphic character respectively, or plesiomorphic trait and symplesiomorphic trait respectively. The term symplesiomorphy was introduced in 1950 by German entomologist Willi Hennig.  Examples  Figure 2: Imaginary cladogram. The yellow mask is a plesiomorphy for each living masked species, because it is ancestral. It is also a symplesiomorphy for them. But for the four living species as a whole, it is a apomorphy because it is not ancestral for all of them. The yellow tail is a plesiomorphy and symplesiomorphy for all living species. Discussion Plesiomorphy and symplesiomorphy correspond to apomorphy and synapomorphy which are derived trait (“evolutionary novelty”) and a shared derived trait. All of these terms are by definition relative in that a trait can be a plesiomorphy in one context and an apomorphy in another (see example in Figure 2). Apomorphic and synapomorphic characteristics convey much information about the evolutionary clades and can be used to define taxa. However, plesiomorphic and symplesiomorphic characteristics cannot. Species should not be grouped purely by morphologic or genetic similarity. Because a plesiomorphic character inherited from a common ancestor can appear anywhere in a phylogenetic tree, its presence does not reveal anything about the relationships within the tree.. Thus grouping species requires distinguishing ancestral from derived character states. An example to illustrate this is the breathing via gills in bony fish and cartilaginous fish. They share it because it was present in their common ancestor. But bony fish that breathe through their skin or lungs evolved into living vertebrates, and are more closely related to terrestrial vertebrates than to sharks and other cartilaginous fish. Another example is thermo-regulation in reptilia and birds. Reptilia are ectothermic (coldblooded) and birds are endothermic (warmblooded). This is plesiomorphic for birds and plesiomorphic for reptiles. Being coldblooded is symplesiomorphic for lizards, turtles and crocodiles, but they do not form a clade without birds, as crocodiles are more related to birds than to lizards and turtles.

Samuel Heinrich Froehlich (1803–1857) was an evangelist responsible for organizing the Evangelical Baptist Church in Western Europe, which eventually spread to become known as the Nazarenes of Eastern EuropeNazarenes article (Hungarian) in the Hungarian Catholic Encyclopedia] and the Apostolic Christian Church in the United States of America, Mexico, Argentina and Canada. Froehlich, a young seminary student in Switzerland, experienced a dramatic conversion, causing him to come into conflict with the state-church. He was excommunicated in the aftermath of his refusal to submit to an order that required the Heidelberg Catechism to be replaced by a new rationalistic catechism. He had sympathies with the Mennonite faith, but soon became convinced they were in a lukewarm state. Some of the Reformed and Mennonite persuasions followed Froehlich and were soon known as \\"Neu-Taufer\\". They later adopted the official name of Evangelical Baptist Church. During this time he became affiliated with Baptist, Mennonite and Anabaptist workers. He was re-baptized in February, 1832, as an adult. Through preaching in private meetings, new churches were planted. The work continued and in thirty-five years an estimated 110 congregations were established. Froehlich was deeply influenced by the Anabaptists (who were known as the radical reformers in sixteenth century Europe). He embraced the following Anabaptist teachings: *Sola Scriptura - Scripture alone is the sole rule of faith and practical living. *Separation of Church and State *Believers' Baptism - adult baptism as opposed to infant baptism. *Holiness of Life *Nonviolence - Opposed killing another human, even in self-defense Froehlich sent Benedict Weyeneth (1819–1887) to America at the request of Joseph Virkler, thus encouraging the foundation of the denomination in the United States. The church spread as Nazarénusok (Nazarener-Gemeinde) in Hungary through the work of a young locksmith Lajos Hencsey (1814–1844) and 1,000 members survive today in Romania. Education Beginning in 1821, Froehlich studied theology at the Carolinum in Zürich, and then in 1823 transferred to the University of Basel. At this time German and Swiss universities were on the leading edge of historical Biblical criticism and Froehlich's instructors were among the most well known of their day. In his studies Froehlich excelled beyond many of his peers under the direction of Johannes Schulthess and Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette. In particular, De Wette was known as a leader in the field of Biblical critique and spent nine years (1810-1819) working with Friedrich Schleiermacher, the father of modern Liberal Christianity, at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. Higher criticism, as it was called then, is the method of Biblical studies which seeks to demystify the texts of the Bible by reading them primarily as historical artifacts of human rather than divine origin. It examines the cultural and historic environment surrounding a text to find the author's original intent apart from any external concerns added by later interpretations. By the end of the 19th century this method had become the de facto standard of Biblical interpretation throughout German speaking academia. Eventually Froehlich's use of historical critique served as the grounds for his rejection of conventional Protestantism. However it also became the tool by which he developed a vision of primitive Christianity stripped free of the human innovations which had been added over the centuries. In this regard he shares significant common ground with other post-Enlightenment dissidents who were to emerge later from the same academic culture. In the early 20th century German Christian communist Eberhard Arnold and Swiss theologian Karl Barth followed a similar course. As with Froehlich they likewise came into conflict with both liberal and conservative streams of German Protestantism and were forced out of Germany at the onset of World War II. In a certain sense Froehlich and these others were simply continuing the original project of the Reformation which was to critically reexamine everything held sacred by the ecclesiastical establishment. By 1825, Froehlich had become disillusioned with his studies, began to doubt his future direction and returned home because of economic constraints. This period marked the beginning of his spiritual awakening. Once home, he preached in various area churches on a trial basis while awaiting his final examination for the ministry; a Latin dissertation on the theme: “De Verbo Dei tamquam Medio Gratiae” and a trial sermon on John 7:16-17 (My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me). The initial examination did not go well as Froehlich himself reports, \\"The principles which I brought to light in these two compositions made such an unfavorable impression upon the members of the church council that I failed in the examination and was put back a year\\".Evidence pg 9 After a further examination, on May 27, 1827, Froehlich was confirmed for the ministry in the Protestant state church. He became parish administrator for the congregation of Leutwil in canton Aargau and then in December 1828, he accepted a call as vicar to the same congregation. His strong preaching began somewhat of a revival in the area and drew visitors from surrounding parishes to the disdain of other clergy. On September 27, 1830, he was brought before a church council to examine his doctrine and his refusal to teach from the new catechism, a replacement of the older Heidelberg catechism. After deliberation, the council released him without coming to a decision. On October 22, 1830, he was formally removed from his office and on June 4, 1831 he was banned from all ecclesiastical service by the district magistrate of Brugg. Theology While one can find a degree of Reformed Protestant influence in Froehlich's writings, particularly earlier on, it quickly becomes apparent that he reflects a profoundly different viewpoint. He made no attempt to harmonize his thinking to any existing systematic theology neither did he try to assemble a comprehensive system of his own. Frequently he denied many of the central tenets common to all Protestant traditions including Reformed, Lutheranism, Calvinism and Arminianism. While speaking on Original Sin he denied mankind's inheritance of any legal condemnation from Adam and describes its effect as primarily one of human brokenness.“For it is through none of our seeking and without our personal fault that we all died as Adam’s children and were lost, and God would not, and never wished to, impute to us and eternally condemn us for that of which we are not blameable.” –Evidence pg 17 On the Atonement of Christ, he occasionally uses the language of Penal Substitution but ultimately denies nearly all of the theological implications that Protestants derive from it.“…they let the matter rest with the imputed righteousness of Christ and comfort themselves falsely with the hope of eternal life. Christ's death is important to us, but His resurrection is more important”-Baptismal Truth, pg 130 Where Reformers like Martin Luther placed a tremendous emphasis on the belief in a forensic understanding of Justification by faith Froehlich denied this entirely. Rather he stated that the end result of Justification for Abraham and us was not the declaration of “Righteousness” but the attainment of the covenant and its promises.“So it is now also with the justification of the sinner by faith; so it is not the purpose of faith, but only the means to an end, namely the acquirement of the Son of the promised seed...” -Evidence, pg 70 In applying the Liberal Protestant tool of rational critique against the Protestant tradition itself, he concluded that the whole of it was seriously corrupted. His opinion of the established church of his day was that it merely upheld a collection of human innovations and manmade traditions while masquerading as the Church of Christ.“The word which St John had in mind as the name of the beast, which was to become and did become the general object of worship in the external church, to the end to supplant Christ, is the Greek word paradosis (tradition)” –Matrimony pg 62 Froehlich was largely influenced by the Anabaptist tradition which had begun a few centuries prior in Europe, particularly by Menno Simons. In his abandonment of Protestant theology, he went even further than most Anabaptists to leave behind the medieval dogmas that had so shaped both the Roman Catholic and Protestant divide of Western Christianity. On some notable doctrines such as Original Sin, Atonement and the Sacraments, Froehlich represents a perspective that is far more in harmony with ancient Eastern Christianity.Froehlich’s view of Original Sin (Evidence pg 17) was common during the Pre-Augustinian Church. The language that he used most often to describe the Atonement was that of the Ransom theory of atonement which was held universally by the early Church Fathers. \\"By His death on the cross and His resurrection from the dead, Christ undoubtedly led His spiritual Israel out of the bondage of sin and devil...\\" -The Mystery of Godliness and the Mystery of Ungodliness, pg 44. Because of this he tended to understand the Atonement as focusing less on obtaining a subjective state of divine forgiveness and more on the objective deliverance from a life of bondage to evil. Regarding the sacraments he expressed a view that is nearly identical to the ancient Eastern Orthodox understanding \\"...holy communion is Christ's body and blood in a mystery as it is imparted through the Spirit of Christ...\\" -Evidence pg 175. At a time when many Christians in the West were busily adapting the EnlightenmentThe Age of Enlightenment was a cultural movement of intellectuals in 18th-century Europe, that sought to mobilize the power of reason, in order to reform society and advance knowledge. ideals of reason and progress to the Christian faith Froehlich called this effort into question. His hermeneutic was based upon a simple, literal and historic reading of the Greek Old (Septuagint) and New Testament scriptures.Old Testament Meditations is a collection of sermon notes drawn from Froehlich’s study and preaching out of the Septuagint (Old Testament Meditations pg 5). Quotes from the deuterocanonical or apocryphal books of the Septuagint, like Sirach, can also be found among his writing. The letter to K. Schwarz in Frohnhausen regarding the manner of his own baptism is an example of this. The Enlighteners, according to the new mode, consider the Bible the word of man, in which is contained much that is foolish, fabulous, fanatical and, to Enlightened reason, objectionable stuff... -Evidence pg 46 Froehlich was often regarded as a fanatic in the tepid religious culture of 19th century Switzerland. He embraced the concept of mystery and refused to be content with either the liberal or conservative expressions of Christianity prevalent in his day. He saw both opinions as a reduction of Christianity into either mere inward sentimentality or a set of dry moral principles. Reason will never grasp the mystery of Christ. Therefore, it speaks so foolishly about it. But faith does not ask why. -Evidence pg 49 His opinions were well informed by the writings of the early Church Fathers and frequently referenced historic Christian practice as a guide. In apologetic writing, he often pitted the greater historical traditions of the Church against the accepted customs of his day.Examples of this can be found throughout Baptismal Truth and Matrimony in his arguments against various customs such as infant baptism and the necessity of state church wedding ceremonies. An old church-father of the second century said that whatever testifies against the truth of the Word of God is heresy, though it were a custom ever so old and superannuated [well established].Froehlich echoes the words of Tertullian as he describes the Rule of Faith “Whatever savours of opposition to truth, this will be heresy, even (if it be an) ancient custom” –Tertullian, On the Veiling of Virgins, chapter 1 -Evidence pg 27. As a preacher, he could be considered a moralist along the lines of other reformers such as John Wesley, Menno Simons or John Chrysostom. He focused primarily on calling people to repentance, baptismal regeneration and an uncompromising pursuit of Jesus Christ and obedience to His word. As with many of the Anabaptists who preceded him, Froehlich held a partially realized eschatology. That is to say he viewed his own time, as well as the times of Christian persecution before him, as part of the tribulation and conflict envisioned in St John's Revelation.Observations on Revelation, pg 60 He took a dissenting view of Christendom in his day and saw the way religion and politics cooperated as a manifestation of the Great Whore and the Beast described in Revelation chapter 17. This vision of cosmic conflict with the political and religious powers was fueled in no small way by the actual violence and coercion leveled against him and his followers.Karoly Eotvos, The Nazarenes, pg 135-164 After being expelled from the state church, Froehlich was eventually banished from Switzerland and forced to leave behind his wife and family. During this separation his wife was fined because their marriage was not recognized by the established church. Many others in the movement were also fined for illegal assembly, imprisoned for proselytizing and persecuted for refusing to bear arms in the military.Heritage of Faith, A History of the Church with An Apostolic Christian Focus, pg 112-117 Only after years of forced separation was he reunited with his family when his wife was able to legally immigrate to Strasbourg and join him in exile. Under such hard struggles the elect of God must show themselves fit for the inheritance of the saints, through the victory over the world; for they do not deal with a few but with the whole world and Christendom as Satan’s new kingdom… What the devil does in the heathen world in a crude way that he does in a more subtle manner in Christendom, and only a few notice that this door to hell is wider than the other. -Observations on Revelation, pg 50 Works *An autobiography *Baptismal Truth *Two Mysteries *Matrimony *Evidence Demonstrating Truth on the Word of God *Meditations on Matthew *Meditations on Luke and John *Meditations on the Acts of the Apostles *Meditations on Romans and Corinthians *Meditations on Ephesians *Meditations on Philippians *Meditations on Hebrews *Meditations on the Epistles of John *Meditations on Revelation *Meditations on the Psalms *Meditations on Isaiah *Old Testament Meditations References External links *Fröhlich, Samuel Heinrich (1803-1857) at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online *Froehlich Library 1803 births 1857 deaths Swiss Anabaptists Evangelists ","title":"Samuel Heinrich Fröhlich"},{"id":"2939300","title":"Casey FitzSimmons"},{"id":"2939323","text":"Havana Club is a brand of rum created in Cuba in 1934. Originally produced in Cárdenas, Cuba by family-owned José Arechabala S.A., the brand was nationalized after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. In 1993, French owned Pernod Ricard and the government of Cuba created a state-run 50:50 joint venture called Corporación Cuba Ron. They began exporting this version of Havana Club globally, except for the United States due to the embargo put in place by the U.S. government. Bacardi, another Cuban family which had left Cuba after the Cuban revolution, after purchasing the original Arechabala family Havana Club recipe, also began producing Havana Club Rum in 1994, a competing product made in Puerto Rico and sold in the United States. Bacardi and Pernod Ricard have engaged in ongoing litigation about ownership of the name “Havana Club”.  Arechabala family history and production  The current distillery in Santa Cruz del NorteThe Arechabala family founded a distillery in Cardenas, Cuba in 1878. Later renamed José Arechabala S.A., the company created the Havana Club brand in 1934, and sold rum under that name in both Cuba and the United States. The company was nationalized without compensation by the Castro government in 1960. The Arechabala family allege it was taken from them at gunpoint. Subsequently, much of the Arechabala family was forced to leave Cuba for Spain and the United States, while other members of the family were imprisoned. The Cuban government sold rum abroad under the Havana Club name beginning in 1972, focusing primarily on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The government focused on Havana Club because (unlike the Bacardi family) the Arechabala family had not established plants outside of Cuba and so could not produce a competing brand. The company was considered a \\"national jewel\\" by the Cuban government, and in 1977 manufacturing was moved to a new plant in Santa Cruz del Norte. Since 1994, Cuban production and non-US global marketing of Havana Club has continued under a joint partnership between Pernod Ricard and Corporación Cuba Ron. In 1994, Bacardi began producing rum under the Havana Club name in Cataño, Puerto Rico using a recipe given to them by Arechabala family members. While originally sold in only a few US states (primarily Florida), production was expanded in 2006, and in 2012, after winning a critical court battle, Bacardi announced plans to sell the rum more broadly. Pernod Ricard/Bacardi trademark conflict  The Havana Club trademark has been the subject of extensive trademark litigation in the US, Spain, and World Trade Organization. After José Arechabala S.A. was nationalized, the Arechabala family fled Cuba and was forced to stop producing rum. The US trademark registration for \\"Havana Club\\" lapsed in 1973. The family alleges that this was due to the company's lawyer, Javier Arechabala, remaining imprisoned at the time. Taking advantage of the lapse, the Cuban government registered the mark in the US in 1976. The brand was then assigned by the Cuban government to Pernod Ricard in 1993. In 1994, Bacardi obtained the Arechabala family's remaining rights in the brand, and began producing limited amounts of rum bearing the name. 922 cases were sold in the US in 1995 and 1996. This drew litigation from Pernod Ricard. Pernod Ricard was successful in two of the first three court holdings issued in this litigation. However, in 1998, after heavy lobbying from Bacardi, the US Congress passed the \\"Bacardi Act\\", which protected trademarks related to expropriated Cuban companies, and effectively ended the first phase of the litigation by eliminating Pernod Ricard's standing. This act (also known as Section 211) has been applied only to the Havana Club trademark. The act was ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization in 2001 and 2002, on grounds that it singled out one country (Cuba). The United States has not yet acted to address the WTO ruling, despite a 2005 deadline and requests from the European Union. Following the initial round of litigation, a second round of litigation occurred, through both the US Federal court system and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, focused in part on the allegedly deceptive nature of the use of \\"Havana\\" in the name of a rum produced outside of Cuba. This round of litigation lasted from 2009 to 2012, and again resulted in a victory for Bacardi. After this defeat, Pernod Ricard announced plans to market the product in the US under the \\"Havanista\\" mark, while Bacardi announced plans to extend distribution of Bacardi's version of Havana Club throughout the US. In Spain, Pernod Ricard's ownership of the mark has been upheld in three court rulings, most recently in 2011. In January 2016, after a thaw in US-Cuba relations, the U.S. government awarded a trademark for Havana Club to the Cuban government, which was \\"expected to reignite longstanding tension between Bacardi Ltd. and the Cuban government\\". Bacardi appealed the decision, and in 2017, Florida lawmakers asked President Donald Trump to reverse the decision.  Current sales and marketing  The Giraldilla of Havana, used on the Havana Club logo and labeling. Pernod Ricard's Havana Club is the fifth-largest rum brand in the world, with almost 4 million cases sold in 2012-2013. It is sold in over 120 countries. Its strongest markets include France, and Germany, where marketing plays off the brand's distribution in East Germany during the Cold War. Since 2008, it is also bottled in India, the world's second-largest rum market. Pernod Ricard plays heavily on Cuban themes in its marketing, including labeling Havana Club as \\"El Ron de Cuba\\" (\\"The Rum of Cuba\\"). It is one of the most common items brought into the US by tourists returning from Cuba. To avoid charges of customer deception, Bacardi's Havana Club labeling prominently mentions that it is made in Puerto Rico and is often referred to as \\"Havana Club Puerto Rican rum\\". Pernod Ricard's labeling, originated by Cubaexport in the 1970s, is gold and red, and features the Giraldilla, a weathervane from the old fort of Havana. Pernod Ricard has announced plans to use similar gold and red labels on their \\"Havanista\\" product in the United States. In 2016, Bacardi announced new branding and sells their version of Havana Club nationally, distilled in Puerto Rico and bottled in Florida.

The film stars Toshiro Mifune as an elderly factory owner so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. The film stars Kurosawa regulars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura. It is in black-and-white and runs 103 minutes. The film was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Kiichi Nakajima (Toshiro Mifune), an elderly foundry owner convinced that Japan will be affected by an imminent nuclear war, resolves to move his family to safety in Brazil. Nakajima's fervent wish is for his family to join him in escaping from Japan to the relative safety of South America. His family decides to have him ruled incompetent, and he is brought before a three-man tribunal, including Dr. Harada (Takashi Shimura), a Domestic Court counselor, for arbitration. Harada, a civil volunteer in the case, sympathizes with Nakajima's conviction. He points out that the fear of atomic and nuclear weapons is present in every citizen of Japan, and wonders aloud whether it is wrong to rule someone incompetent simply for being more worried than the average citizen. Eventually, the old man's irrational behavior prevents the court from taking his fears seriously, and he is found incompetent. Nakajima grows more and more obsessed with the idea of escaping Japan, eventually resulting in a tragic decision, once he is convinced it is the only way to save his loved ones. The film ends with the doctor pondering whether it may be more insane to ignore the nuclear threat than to take it too seriously.

He had been Kurosawa's close friend since 1948 and had collaborated with him on several films. Hayasaka had, during the last decade of his life, a celebrated association with Kurosawa. The 1948 film Drunken Angel (Yoidore tenshi) was their first film together and later they worked on Rashomon. The director and composer collaborated to test “oppositional handling of music and performance” and, in his autobiography, Kurosawa would say that working with Hayasaka changed his views on how film music should be used; from then on, he viewed music as “counterpoint” to the image and not just an “accompaniment”.Kurosawa, Akira.

The chain then went through a series of restructuring and ownership changes until it was purchased by Legendary Restaurant Brands, LLC in 2015. The company is now operating out of Dallas, Texas. Bennigan's old logo from the 1990s. Bennigan's Restaurant, in 2010, Denver, Colorado History Bennigan's was established in 1976 in Atlanta, Georgia, as part of the Pillsbury Corporation. The first significant Bennigan's location was opened in Tysons Corner, Virginia, the following year. The concept was the brainchild of company vice president and Steak and Ale founder Norman E. Brinker. By the early 1980s Bennigan's had become one of the best known of the new style mid-range casual dining franchised \\"fern bar\\" eating and drinking establishments in the United States. In 1983, Brinker led an exodus of senior management from the S&A; and Bennigan's division, purchasing a small regional restaurant concept that focused on gourmet hamburgers, Chili's. Bennigan's continued to grow across the United States, as well as opening locations in fourteen countries. When Pillsbury was acquired by Grand Metropolitan in 1989 (Grand Met later merged with Guinness in 1997 to become Diageo), the company was spun off. As a major liquor distributor selling such brands as Bombay gin, J&B; and other spirits, Grand Metropolitan was bound by \\"Tied house\\" laws that prohibited liquor distributors from owning liquor retailers. S&A; management, underwritten by Metromedia, led the leveraged buyout of S&A; in 1991 A Bennigan's sign featuring the old logo, before the November 2010 revamp of the Bennigan's brand. In South Korea, however, Bennigan's operated for several additional years with this logo. = Corporate closure = The failure of Bennigan's executives to update and grow the restaurant concept, a degrading quality of their menu items over a period of time, led to a downfall of sales and customer patronage. John Owens, a Morningstar analyst, was quoted by the Boston Herald as saying: \\"Bennigan’s was the weakest of the major players\\" and Bob Goldin, an executive vice president of the restaurant industry consulting group Technomic was quoted by The New York Times as saying:“All these bar and grill concepts are very, very similar, [...] They have the same kind of menu, décor, appeal,” This translated into a lack of customer loyalties. In May 2006 Bennigans closed most of its New York and New England locations. In July 2008, all of Bennigan's 150 corporate locations across the US were closed due to parent company Metromedia Restaurant Group of Plano, Texas filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and initially the firm's 138 franchisee-owned locations remained open, but many later closed in the months and years after the bankruptcy filing. Several international locations, however, remained open. In South Korea, for instance, over 30 locations still operated as usual. The brand was restructured in 2010 as a result of ownership changes. The operator of Bennigan's in South Korea announced that all locations in the country will be closed by January 31, 2016. Bennigan's new prototype = New ownership = In October 2008, Atalaya Capital Management acquired the Bennigan's and Steak and Ale brands. The assets include the Bennigan's Franchising Co., which owned the rights to franchise the Bennigan's brand and was instrumental in keeping franchise-owned restaurants operating during the bankruptcy period. In a statement by the firm, it was stated that the company planned to reposition the brand by re-establishing its place in the high- margin bar segment and by focusing on sandwiches and appetizers. It also said the company planned to reopen 50 or 60 formerly company-owned Bennigan's locations by finding new or existing franchisees to operate the restaurants. In May 2011 new management of the firm stated that they wanted to return the brand to its roots but also give Bennigan's new life in the 21st century. In an interview of CEO Paul Mangiamele, he stated that the company's strategy to turn the brand around was multi-pronged. The company planned to introduce a new logo, store prototype, financial and franchise models, an updated menu, improved marketing, adding a catering operation and a new attitude. On February 11, 2015, CEO Paul Mangiamele and his wife, Gwen, closed on a Management Buy Out (MBO) of the company from its parent private equity firm, for an undisclosed price. The new company, Legendary Restaurant Brands, LLC, is now the owner of the Bennigan's restaurant chain, its fast-casual concept Bennigan's On the Fly, and the Steak and Ale brand. = Recent = , there are 18 international and 15 United States locations and according to the CEO, Paul Mangiamele, Bennigan's has over 100 units in development including international locations in Amsterdam, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Pakistan.

Romano's Macaroni Grill is an American casual dining restaurant chain specializing in Italian-American cuisine. The company has 88 locations around the world and is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. History The first restaurant was founded by Texas restaurateur Philip J. Romano in Leon Springs, Texas (now a district of San Antonio), on April 19, 1988. (The original location is now independently operated as The Grill at Leon Springs.) Brinker International, Inc. bought the franchise rights to the company on November 22, 1989. Brinker announced on August 8, 2007, that it would begin exploring a buyer for the 230 company- owned stores. On December 18, 2008, Brinker announced that a majority stake in the chain was sold to Mac Acquisition LLC, an affiliate of Golden Gate Capital. As of June 29, 2011, Brinker still holds a 15.6% minority interest in the concept. On February 6, 2013, Ignite Restaurant Group announced the acquisition of Romano's Macaroni Grill from Golden Gate Capital through a $55.0 million all-cash transaction. Redrock Partners LLC purchased the concept from Ignite in April 2015 for $8 million. On October 18, 2017, Romano's Macaroni Grill filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On September 21, 2018, Romano's bought Sullivan's Steakhouse for $32 million. Products Romano's Macaroni Grill menu features items found in traditional cuisine from Italy and the Mediterranean area. The menu includes a custom-assembled pasta dish, with a choice of pastas, sauces, and toppings. Meals are served with complimentary bread and olive oil. The chain touts its sourcing of various ingredients directly from family-owned businesses in Italy for quality, flavor, and business transparency. In addition to their restaurants, the brand also features a line of packaged food products based on dishes offered by the restaurant. The packages are manufactured by General Mills Restaurant Favorites line. Nutrition In 2007, Men's Health rated Romano's Macaroni Grill one of the unhealthiest restaurant chains, giving it an 'F' on its \\"Restaurant Report Card.\\" According to the report, an average meal from the chain contains over 1,000 calories. Three years later, however, the magazine rated Macaroni Grill as the healthiest Italian chain, noting that a number of entrees had significantly decreased in calorie count. This was attributed to the hiring of a new CEO with a \\"multiphase plan to improve the nutritional quality.\\" Global operations The company has international locations in many countries around the world, including: * Bahrain * Oman * Egypt * Germany * Japan * Kuwait * Mexico * Qatar * United Arab Emirates * United States of America References External links * Official website Companies based in Dallas Companies based in Denver Restaurants established in 1988 Restaurant chains in the United States Italian-American cuisine Italian-American culture in Texas Italian restaurants 1988 establishments in Texas 2013 mergers and acquisitions 2015 mergers and acquisitions Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017 ","title":"Romano's Macaroni Grill"},{"id":"2939361","text":"Transformers (also known as Transformers Armada: Prelude to Energon) is a video game based on the Transformers: Armada animated series, itself part of the Transformers franchise. It was developed by Atari Melbourne House, published by Atari, Inc. and released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The game follows a different storyline than the series, though it also sees both the Autobots and the Decepticons searching for the recently discovered Mini-Cons on Earth, whose combined powers will grant either faction victory in their deadly civil war.  Gameplay  Transformers is a third- person shooter game, where players assume the role of one of three Autobots: Optimus Prime, Red Alert or Hot Shot, who are all able to transform between robot and vehicle modes at the push of the triangle button. The game revolves around the collection of Mini-Cons, which can be equipped to the Transformer. These include weapons such as a pistol; support items, such as glider wings; and stat-enhancements, such as an armour boost. Up to four can be equipped at once, and with the exception of stat-enhancements, they can be controlled using the shoulder buttons. The 'R1' primary weapon will always be assigned, and if none (Mini-con) are chosen, the default rifle is used in its stead. There is a limit to what Mini-cons can be equipped with respect to the power game mechanic, with more powerful Mini-cons taking up a lot of space. The more of the same colour/suit Mini-cons equipped, the stronger one's character will be. This is referred to as \\"Mini-con linking.\\" For the most part, the Mini- cons do not change the aesthetics of the transformer.  Plot  The game doesn't follow the already established storyline of the animated series, although it still mostly revolves around Mini-Cons - miniature Transformers who fled their home planet of Cybertron and crash-landed on Earth millions of years ago, going into stasis. In the present, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons, led by the villainous Megatron, are engaged in a deadly war for Cybertron. The game's opening sequence shows Megatron launching a final assault on the Autobot Headquarters on Cybertron, alongside his Decepticlones, a powerful army of Decepticon drones. Having the numeric advantage, Megatron is able to overcome the Autobot resistance, before engaging Optimus in a one-on-one fight. Before the winner can be decided, a Mini-Con distress beacon activates on Earth. Well-aware of what this means, Megatron and his Decepticlone forces head to Earth to claim the Mini-Cons, while Optimus and his fellow Autobots Red Alert and Hot Shot return to their headquarters, from where they operate a Space Bridge to travel to various locations around the planet one at a time, and attempt to retrieve the Mini- Cons before the Decepticons do. They first travel to the Amazon and proceed to retrieve any Mini-Con they find and destroy the Decepticlone patrols, before encountering the Decepticon Cyclonus at some ancient ruins, who dispatches several Decepticlone Heavy Units to attack them. After destroying them and chasing Cyclonus away, the Autobots find the Mini-Cons Sparkplug, Jolt and Longarm, who send out a call to the other Mini-Cons on Earth and join the Autobots. The Autobots next go to Antartica, making their way past icy canyons, an open glacial area, and a crashed human plane in order to reach a research facility, where the Decepticons have already found a Mini-Con. They defeat the Decepticlones guards and Starscream, before learning that Cyclonus is still at the Amazon, meaning that there are still Mini-Cons left there. The Autobots depart with the Mini-Con, unaware that Starscream is still online. Back at the Amazon, the Autobots fight their way through the jungle and then an ancient pyramid, ultimately reaching the Decepticon base, where they defeat Cyclonus, causing him to crash and explode. Afterwards, the Autobots spot several Decepticon Dropships heading to the Atlantic Ocean and follow them. There, they find Tidal Wave in his massive warship mode, and fight their way across multiple small islands, ultimately finding the Mini-Con Slipstream, who grants them the ability to glide. They use this to board the ship and make their way to its control room, learning it is headed to Alaska. Tidal Wave then transforms into his robot mode, but the Autobots target his head, ultimately destroying him and causing him to plunge into the ocean. The Autobots travel to Alaska, believing it to be the location of Megatron's base on Earth, and make their way through the snowy mountains and a cave system, before Starscream crashes a ship on purpose in an attempt to stop them. Fighting their way through the crashed ship, the Autobots confront Starscream on the bridge, but the scuffle causes the ship to fall off a cliff and into a valley down below. After making their way out of the ship, the Autobots defeat Starscream, who is knocked out by Optimus after a failed interrogation. Hacking into his warp transponder, Red Alert learns that Megatron's base is actually located on a volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean, so the Autobots head there next. They fight their way to the island's center, which is an active volcano, where they battle and defeat Megatron, before the volcano erupts. Optimus attempts to save Megatron, but he refuses his help and allows himself to fall into the lava. Escaping from the volcano, the Autobots believe they won, unaware that the planet-sized Transformer Unicron has arrived on Cybertron. As Unicron begins destroying Cybertron, Optimus, Red Alert and Hot Shot return home alongside all the rescued Mini-Cons, whose combined powers give the three Autobots the means to stop Unicron. Equipped with jetpacks, they fly into Unicron and destroy his core, causing him to explode, not before the Autobots get a safe distance away. Afterwards, the Autobots and Mini-Cons celebrate their victory and that Cybertron is finally at peace.  Development  The worldwide debut of the Transformers PlayStation 2 demo occurred at TransformersCon on March 12–13, 2004. In September 2005, Atari released a Directors Cut of the game exclusively in the EU. This version includes several \\"Making of\\" movie clips and commercials on the game disc. A playable demo was included on the disc for Driv3r. Australian band Regurgitator provided the soundtrack to the game. The song \\"Wishbone\\" by the band Dropbox was used to promote the game.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Most Curvularia are found in tropical regions, though a few are found in temperate zones. Curvularia defined by the type species C. lunata (Wakker) Boedijn. Curvularia lunata appears as shiny velvety-black, fluffy growth on the colony surface. C. lunata is distinguished by septate, dematiaceous hyphae producing brown, geniculate conidiophores. The poroconidia are curved slightly to distinctly, transversely septate, with an expanded third cell from the pore end of the conidium. Curvularia can be easily distinguished from Bipolaris and Drechslera spp. since the conidia are non-distoseptate, that is, septate from edge to edge of the conidial wall. The teleomorphic state of the type species Curvularia lunata is Cochliobolus lunatus (Fam. Pleosporaceae, Ord. Pleosporales, Cla. Loculoascomycetes, Phy. Ascomycota). Heat-tolerance symbiote Curvularia protuberata is an endosymbiote of the panic grass Dichanthelium lanuginosum that enables it to thrive near hot springs in soil temperatures of up to 104 °F (40 °C). The fungus confers this protective effect only when itself infected by the Curvularia thermal tolerance virus (CThTV).

The company was founded by Harry Berkowitz who opened the Legal Cash Market grocery store in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his son George then opened the first restaurant next door to the market in 1968. The current company headquarters is located in the South Boston Seaport District and as of 2019, the group operates 33 restaurants in five states, plus the District of Columbia, with most in the Greater Boston area. The restaurant serves over 7 million customers annually with an average restaurant size of . Legal Sea Foods also operates an online fish market and ships fresh fish anywhere in the contiguous United States, as well as a retail products division. In addition to the traditional Legal Sea Foods locations, the company operates unique concepts including: Legal Test Kitchen, Legal C Bar, Legal Harborside, Legal Crossing, Legal Oysteria, Legal on the Mystic, and Legal Fish Bowl. Legal Sea Foods’ long-standing tagline is \\"If it isn’t fresh, it isn’t Legal!\\" History In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the \\"Legal Cash Market\\" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The name for the market came from the \\"Legal Stamps\\", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business. In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish. From the early 1950s, the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They offered fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops, served on paper plates while the customers sat at picnic tables. In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire. With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, George opened their flagship location in the Boston Park Plaza in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston. =1980s= At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods' fish chowder was chosen to represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since. Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution. In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named \\"Best Seafood Restaurant in America\\" by NBC's Today Show. =1990s= In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and helped to establish a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety. In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning \\"Fresh Insights\\" radio campaign. In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years. Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited influential chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called \\"Cusineast\\" and some dishes created for this event are still on the current menu. At the Super Bowl XXXI in 1997, fans in New Orleans were served New England clam chowder from Legal's Chowda van. In 1998, Roger Berkowitz was invited to join the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Roundtable, a group of people with personal and professional interests in nutrition. In the same year, Bon Appétit magazine named Legal Sea Food one of the Top Ten Tried and True restaurants in America. Rich Vellante also became the restaurant group's Executive Chef in 1998 and is currently still in this position. In 1999, the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association presented Roger Berkowitz with the Silver Plate award for the best full- service, multi-unit restaurant operator in America. This award is the one of the food industry's highest honors. =2000s= In 2000, the American Institute of Food and Wine sponsored Legal Sea Food's 50th birthday with celebrity chefs, including Julia Child, in attendance. The CBS news program, Eye on America, focused on Legal Sea Food restaurant's quality control program with a segment on food safety. Legal Sea Foods Quality Control Center and corporate headquarters as seen from Boston Harbor (2017). In 2003, Legal Sea Food restaurants became one of America's first restaurants to go trans-fat free. The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook was published that year. In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and comparably lower prices than traditional Legal sea Foods locations. Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options. In 2008, Legal Sea Foods was named one of the ten best full-service or buffet-style restaurant chains which cater to families, according to Parents magazine. Later in 2008, Roger Berkowitz was inducted into the Nation's Restaurant News MenuMasters Hall of Fame. In 2009, Legal C Bar opened in Dedham, Massachusetts, focused on serving casual seafood and custom cocktails. =2010s= In 2011, Legal opened their new flagship restaurant, Legal Harborside on the Boston waterfront. It was named \\"Best New Restaurant\\" by Esquire magazine. In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section of Boston named Legal Crossing (LX). On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings. In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. The restaurant is a fast-casual concept that features six signature poke bowls as well as the option to make your own. In that same year, Roger Berkowitz was awarded a “Who’s Who” James Beard Award. In 2018, the company opened a Legal Sea Bar, a bar-forward concept, in Union Station in Washington, DC. In 2019, Legal Sea Foods started a collaboration with Stonewall Kitchen, a specialty food manufacturer based in Maine, on a line of signature sauces, dressings and condiments. These products are sold under the name ‘Legal Sea Foods by Stonewall Kitchen” and range from cocktail sauce to lemon dill aioli. =2020s= In January 2020, Legal Sea Foods announced a partnership with RLJ Companies to expand the presence of Legal Sea Foods restaurants in major airports across the United States. Operations In addition to its traditional Legal Sea Foods restaurants, the company operates distinct concepts with unique offerings: Legal Test Kitchen, Legal C Bar, Legal Harborside, Legal Crossing, Legal Oysteria, Legal on the Mystic, Legal Fish Bowl and Legal Sea Bar, all with their distinct culture. Legal Sea Foods became one of the first restaurants in the United States to employ lean production techniques to improve the customer experience. One of the main changes was to install a line back position, similar to a bar-back, to quickly restock whatever the chef or cook needed in a just-in-time flow. Menu The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Some of the most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and kids’ menu. By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).Apple, R.W., Jr., \\"In the Quest for Safer Seafood, One Company Follows Its Nose\\", The New York Times, November 29, 2000 In the media Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's \\"Top Ten Tried- and-True\\" dining experiences. Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, \\"1,000 Places to See Before You Die\\". The Legal Harborside first floor dining room at their restaurant in the South Boston Waterfront. The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons. Legal Sea Foods CEO, Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was \\"flawed\\" and \\"outdated.\\" While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish. =Awards= Advertising and marketing Since 2007, DeVito/Verdi has been Legal Sea Foods’ advertising agency of record. In 2008, Legal Sea Foods ran a humorous campaign called \\"Really Fresh Fish\\". The campaign's out-of-home and radio advertisements created controversy for their “fresh” lines and won industry awards. In 2010, the company launched a radio campaign called \\"Fresh Insights\\". CEO Roger Berkowitz was the voice of the ads, which were finalists in the Radio Mercury Awards. In 2014, Legal began running print and television spots that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain; the series of advertisements use the restaurant's chief executive, Berkowitz to explain why. In March 2015, Legal Sea Foods partnered with Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank. In 2015, Legal launched a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as \\"pescatarians\\", comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website. The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses. During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the \\"fishy\\" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media. The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print. \\"Welcome to Legal\\" launched in 2019 with advertisements that play on the legality of marijuana in Massachusetts. The campaign received national attention, with commentary from publications including AdWeek and AdAge. Affiliations Legal Sea Foods has a long relationship with the Boston Red Sox and Boston Celtics. The Celtics’ \\"Fan of the Game\\" promotion was founded by Legal Sea Foods and has played at every home game for over 10 years. The company also sponsors the Washington Capitals. In addition, Legal Sea Foods introduced the \\"Lobster Lob\\" at all home games played by the Boston Pride, part of the National Women's Hockey League, in the 2019–2020 season.

Initially developed under the title Toad Warrior, the film gained its current title for its 2002 release. The story was co-conceived by Donald G. Jackson, creator of the Frogtown franchise. The film stars Scott Shaw, Joe Estevez, Conrad Brooks, and Jill Kelly. Plot The Earth is being swept by a toad plague.

According to Donald G. Jackson, Max Hell Frog Warrior is not so much a sequel as it is a standalone film inspired by the original concept for Hell Comes to Frogtown. Zen Filmmaking This film is considered a Zen Film in that it was created in the distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw known as Zen Filmmaking. In this style of filmmaking no scripts are used; instead a rough plot is outlined including the basic scenes and locations and then the crew and actors improvise the rest, all dialogue and action is spontaneous and entire plot points, scenes and setpieces are formulated on the spot. Shaw and Jackson have claimed the technique offers freedom of creativity allowing for very natural performances from actors and a unique artistic outcome.

AFANA has an emphasis on the fan, and aims to help the game to develop and to improve its exposure in North America, including better TV coverage. Early history AFANA was co-founded by three members of the 1995-1996 campaign: Richard Lipp of Kansas City, Wade Hinkle of Dallas, and Rob de Santos (then of Vienna, WV) when it was learned that the sport had no TV coverage for the 1996 season. The campaign was ultimately successful and coverage began on the new ESPN2 (\\"the deuce\\") network in June. The network declined to cover the Grand Final in 1996. The AFL tried to find another network but in the end turned to AFANA and the Australian American Chamber of Commerce of Southern California. The two organizations successfully put the game on the air on satellite in the USA and Canada in just 8 days. This firmly established AFANA. The following year, coverage continued on ESPN. Again, problems with the Grand Final occurred when ESPN delayed the broadcast 95 minutes (due to live baseball) on just 36 hours notice after repeated assurances that the game would be live. Despite an intense lobbying effort, ESPN did not budge. The relationship between the Australian Football League, AFANA, and ESPN continued to be strained and after the 1997 season, the network again dropped the sport. With AFANA's help, the sport moved to the new Fox Sports World channel the following year. Coverage The organization has played a part in every effort to keep TV coverage since its founding including network changes in 1998, 2007, 2009, and 2012. In 2004, Fox announced the channel was changing names to Fox Soccer Channel and would eventually drop all non-soccer coverage. AFANA successfully lobbied for the coverage to continue into the 2006 season. The following year resulted in a major success of the lobby group with the televising of live AFL matches beginning in 2007 by Setanta Sports (USA). Current TV coverage is again on Fox networks including Fox Sports 2 and Fox Soccer Plus, a premium network. Coverage was briefly lost when Setanta Sports USA went into bankruptcy in August, 2009. ESPN picked up coverage on its internet channel, then ESPN360 (later ESPN3) plus about 4 matches a year and the Grand Final on ESPN2. ESPN did not renew the contract after 2011. Weekly coverage returned in 2012 to Fox Soccer Plus the successor channel to Fox Sports World. For the 2018 season, officials at the Australian Football League have told AFANA coverage will continue on Fox Soccer Plus and on through the 2020 season. A post on the AFANA website says Fox Soccer Plus will broadcast a minimum of 2 live games per week. The network has also committed to show all finals matches, leading up to and including the Grand Final. AFANA consolidates the schedules of every network in North America which carries the sport into one listing on its web site, a major convenience for fans. Grand Final Parties One of AFANA's major services is the posting of announcements of the many AFL Grand Final parties held in North America (and sometimes Europe and Asia). These yearly parties are typically held the day of the Grand Final and usually feature Australian food and beverages as the staple refreshments for the event.

In 1946 Dino Battaglia became part of the so- called Group of Venice with Fernando Carcupino, Hugo Pratt and Damiano Damiani. Biography Born in Venice, Battaglia first entered the comic book profession in 1946 co-founding and producing work for the Italian magazine Asso di Picche, where he drew some pages of the Junglemen series. Here he worked with other Venetian artists, among them Hugo Pratt and Alberto Ongaro. When Asso di Picche folded in 1948, the Venetian Group (as they became known) moved to Argentina to work for Italian publisher Cesar Civita. Battaglia remained behind in Italy, opting for marriage instead of joining the Argentine move, but he drew the pirate strip Capitan Caribe, written by Ongaro and published in Héctor Germán Oesterheld's magazine Frontera, and other strips such as Cowboy Kid for Salgari. In 1950 Battaglia moved to Milan, where he worked for Mondadori's Pecos Bill and for Il Vittorioso. Between 1952 and 1953 he created Mark Fury, a pugilistic strip set in Edwardian England for Intrepido. The series was translated and republished in Junior Express between 1955–56, introducing Battaglia to the British market. In 1959 he started a collaboration with English publisher Fleetway through Milan-based Roy D'Ami studio, producing several short stories for Top Spot, Knockout, Thriller Picture Library and Look and Learn. Starting in 1960 Battaglia produced a series of adaptations of fairy tales and classic novels for Il Corriere dei Piccoli and Il Corriere dei Ragazzi. In 1965 he drew I Cinque della Selena, a science fiction series written by Mino Milani. In 1967 the magazine Sgt. Kirk published an adaptation of Moby Dick, a work that marked Battaglia's artistic maturity: his drawings achieved the unique, distinctive style that characterised all his later productions. From then on, Battaglia focused on adaptations rather than on original series: he was particularly interested in classic novelists like Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, Stevenson, Maupassant and Hoffmann. He illustrated several of these writers' gothic short stories for Linus magazine, earning the title of Master of Darkness. During the 1970s Battaglia produced a series of religious works for Il Messaggero dei Ragazzi and Il Giornalino, including the biographies of Antonio da Padova and Frate Francesco, as well as adaptation of classic satires like Till Eulenspiegel (1975) and Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel (1979). In the late 1970s he began working for publisher Bonelli, producing L’Uomo della Legione and L'Uomo del New England for the series Un uomo un'avventura. In 1982 he created his only original series, L'Ispettore Coke (Inspector Coke) for the publisher Isola Trovata, featuring a detective of Scotland Yard who faces strange cases in stories set at the beginning of the 20th century. Only two album publications, I delitti della fenice (The Crimes of the Phoenix) and La Mummia (The Mummy) were completed before the work was interrupted by Battaglia's unexpected death in 1983. Since 1950, Battaglia's wife Laura De Vescovi collaborated on writing the scenarios and as colourist on his stories. Several comics critics have written theses on Battaglia, and his original artworks have been the subject of many expositions. Because of his preference for adaptations, Battaglia has never reached the notoriety of some of his contemporaries, but the expressive skill of Battaglia have earned him the respect of comics connoisseurs and his works are reprinted still today.

First appearing in Wonder Woman, vol. 1, issue #5 (1943), written by Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston, the character would become one of the Amazing Amazon's most persistent enemies, reappearing throughout the Golden, Silver, Bronze and Modern Age of Comics. Over the decades, he has undergone several minor updates as comics continuities have shifted and evolved, though his distinctive physical appearance has remained largely faithful to artist Harry G. Peter's original 1943 design. After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes, were re-imagined and reintroduced. Prior to this reboot, Doctor Psycho demonstrated a command over the occult and was able to harness supernatural energies to project illusions. Since his Post-Crisis reintroduction, the character has been presented as a powerful telepath and telekenetic. Despite these changes, Doctor Psycho has consistently been portrayed as a misogynistic short person with psychic powers that suffers from a mental illness (ranging from mild obsessiveness to full-blown dissociation). Doctor Psycho made his animation debut as a regular in Harley Quinn, with his voice provided by actor and comedian Tony Hale. Background The character of Doctor Psycho was created by William Moulton Marston, creator of Wonder Woman and author of her original adventures, as an allegory of the folly of abnormal emotions such as misogyny and other hatred, as well as to be another embodiment of what he called \\"less actively developed men\\" (emotionally misaligned) who needed emotional reform by a love leader (Wonder Woman). William Moulton Marston's creation of Doctor Psycho drew upon his interest in metaphysics and spiritualism. Marston, a psychologist, created Doctor Psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women. The character was partly inspired by actor Lon Chaney (\\"Man of a thousand faces\\") and partly by Marston's undergraduate advisor Hugo Münsterberg, who was opposed to women's suffrage and feminism, and was into metaphysics. Doctor Psycho was also one of several villains created for Wonder Woman who were occultists, beguiling the masses for their own self-enriching purposes. As Wonder Woman's rogues and supporting cast were largely jettisoned during the period that Robert Kanigher wrote and edited the issues, Doctor Psycho remained one of the few villains to appear in the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age adventures. The character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths Wonder Woman. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Doctor Psycho first appears as a pawn of the Duke of Deception. The God of War, enraged that women were gaining power in Earth society and potentially threatening his ability to engulf the world in war, ordered Deception to discredit women. Deception called upon Doctor Psycho to set about eliminating women from the war effort. Doctor Psycho was revealed in flashback to have been a medical student who was frequently humiliated by his peers. He discovered that his fiancée Marva Jane Gray was in love with college athletic champion Ben Bradley. Bradley removed him as a rival for Marva's affections by stealing $125,000 worth of radium from the college lab and hunching down in disguise so that Marva would think she saw her diminutive fiancé as the culprit. Convicted on the basis of Marva's testimony, Psycho seethed behind bars for years, planning his revenge while developing an intense hatred of all women. Upon his release, he tortured and killed Bradley, who falsely confessed that Marva was his willing accomplice. Psycho then kidnapped and tortured Marva, hypnotically compelling her to marry him, and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments. Learning that he could use Marva as a medium for summoning ectoplasm he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body, he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions. At Deception's urging, he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of George Washington, claiming that women were hindering the war effort. He also disguised himself as Colonel Darnell of Military Intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage. With the aid of Steve Trevor and the Holliday College girls, Wonder Woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him go, unable to prove any of his crimes in a court of law.Wonder Woman #5 Doctor Psycho fixated his pathological hatred of women into fantasies of revenge against Wonder Woman. Freed from Psycho's influence, Marva joined the WAACs and helped Wonder Woman expose Nazi saboteur Stoffer, who had disguised himself as General Scott.Sensation Comics #20 Psycho was eventually imprisoned but escaped by faking his own death, kidnapping Marva and then his former secretary, Joan White, to use as mediums for his ectoplasmic power. He attempted to court Etta Candy in a disguise, but his cover was blown by Etta's suitor Oscar Sweetgulper and he was returned to prison.Wonder Woman #18 In the Golden Age, Psycho's brother Ironsides was a brilliant geologist who was also a villain. Ironsides invented the Iron Giant's disguise. He did not, however, display any superpowers. Psycho eventually realized that he could use Steve Trevor as a medium. Kidnapping Trevor, he fashioned an ectoplasmic dream of power from Trevor's unconscious mind and became the powerful Captain Wonder, who teamed up with the Silver Swan to destroy Wonder Woman. His powerful form was destroyed when Trevor awakened from his slumber. When the Monitor was testing heroes and villains in the run-up to the Crisis on Infinite Earths, he set up Doctor Psycho to retrieve ectoplasmic machinery from military intelligence and to fight with several of Wonder Woman's other rogues, but they were defeated by the combined might of Wonder Woman and Etta Candy, who used the ectoplasm machine to create a superpowered version of herself patterned after Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman #323 =Post-Crisis= He is a telepath with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people's dreams. Psycho was enlisted by Circe to create disturbing dreams for Wonder Woman's close friend, Vanessa Kapatelis, with the result that Wonder Woman would be forced to separate herself from her closest allies. This was part of a plot intended to leave Wonder Woman isolated and create widespread public fear of her fellow Amazons. Psycho later helps warp Kapatelis' damaged psyche to turn her into the new Silver Swan. Dr. Psycho's plans are foiled and he subsequently spends some time as a patient in a mental facility, confined to a padded room and a straitjacket. Several members of the time-lost Legion of Super-Heroes were in telepathic range. When Saturn Girl mentally shouts for a lost member, this awakened Dr. Psycho enough for him to attack several staff members and flee. The call brought him to the Legion, whom he also attacks. In the Villains United miniseries leading up to Infinite Crisis, Psycho has surfaced as a core member of Lex Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains. Working with Talia al Ghul, he recruits many supervillains for the Society, and is rejected and successfully rebuffed by Catman. He threatens to have Catman kill himself. The presence of the man's loyal pack of lions convinces Psycho that he might be eaten if he forces Catman to harm himself. This rejection angers him, causing much grumbling for some time afterwards. He also spends time working with Deathstroke in order to capture one of the Marvel Family. Other members of the Society realize that Psycho is trying to mentally influence them. Unaffected, they brush it off as something to be expected. After the events of the 6th issue of Infinite Crisis, Psycho travels with Warp to free Doomsday from captivity near the center of the Earth. He takes control of Doomsday, and uses him to spearhead a supervillain assault on Metropolis. The villains lose this battle. One Year Later, Doctor Psycho is arrested and put on trial with Kate Spencer (Manhunter) as his defense attorney. Following his arrest, he is abandoned by the Society. During the trial, he uses his mind-controlling abilities to make Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers are returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. He uses his telepathy to hold the people in the courtroom hostage. This forces Spencer to try to put on her uniform but she instead reveals herself to Doctor Psycho as Manhunter. Psycho then makes Kate put on her suit, but drops his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This causes him to forget about Kate's alter-ego and lose his powers. Doctor Psycho has lately been shown still in a position of authority with the Society in the Secret Six miniseries. He has been working with former enemy Cheshire for Vandal Savage and hiring various villains to put out hits on other Secret Six members. In the final issue of Secret Six (December 2006), he is stabbed repeatedly and seriously injured by the Mad Hatter. He resurfaced with his powers restored and amplified by Circe in the Wonder Woman series beginning in 2006. He was assisting Cheetah and Giganta.Wonder Woman vol. 3 #01 On the cover of Justice League of America (vol. 2) #13, it shows Doctor Psycho as a member of the latest Injustice League. During the Final Crisis storyline, Genocide was sent to the DMA (Department of Metahuman Affairs) Headquarters to retrieve Doctor Psycho, who is held captive there.Wonder Woman vol. 3 #27 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Doctor Psycho first appears in Superboy; a con man psychic who practices seance, using his telepathy to steal identities of customers in Manhattan.

Later during the \\"Trinity War\\" storyline, Question gives Superman a newspaper clipping stating that Doctor Psycho was sighted in Khandaq the day when Doctor Light was killed. This causes Superman, Question, and the Justice League to go after Doctor Psycho.Justice League Dark #22 Superman, Question, and the others arrive in Pittsburgh to confront Doctor Psycho. Martian Manhunter looks into Doctor Psycho's mind and learns that he was sent to Kahndaq by the Secret Society, but did not do anything to control Superman's mind.Justice League of America vol. 3 #7 During the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, Doctor Psycho is among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate to join the Secret Society of Super Villains. Then he appears in Justice League vol. 2 #29, where he is sent by the Society, along with the Fearsome Five and Hector Hammond, to fight against Cyborg and the Metal Men. He ends up being defeated by Gold. =DC Rebirth= After the events of DC Rebirth, Doctor Psycho's history had been altered. Using his illusions to pose as a scientist for A.R.G.U.S. named Dr. Edward Carne, Doctor Psycho was first seen after Vanessa Kapatelis was defeated and brought into custody by Wonder Woman. As Doctor Carne, Psycho told Wonder Woman that when Vanessa woke from her comatose state that he would be there for her.Wonder Woman #40 (April 2018) Later, Doctor Psycho was one of several powerful psychics kidnapped by Amanda Waller to hack into Brainiac's mind.Justice League: No Justice #1 (2018) In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Doctor Psycho is among the villains that attend an underground meeting held by the Riddler, where they talk about the Superman Theory.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Psycho is a skilled occultist, and uses psionic powers to traumatize and terrify those who stand in his way. In his Pre-Crisis appearances, he was a hypnotist skilled in the occult who used his victims to draw ectoplasm into the physical world, which he shaped into various beings and disguises. In The New 52 continuity, Doctor Psycho possesses psychic abilities including the regular telepathy, mind control, astral projection, telekinesis, levitation, projecting destructive blasts of psionic energy and creating psionic energy constructs such as armor, although Edgar has stated that he possesses every psionic power imaginable. However, he does not have the energy required to use his abilities to their fullest. He can overcome this weakness by siphoning mental energies from other individuals with psionic powers such as Superboy.

This version of the character is Dr. Leon Zeiko, a pick-up artist who manipulates Wonder Woman. =Gods and Monsters= Doctor Psycho appears in the tie-in comics of Justice League: Gods and Monsters under the identity of Dr. Jackson Alpert, who's working for a C.I.A. project called MKUltra, where they used psychotropic drugs to experiment on human beings without their knowledge or permission, all because they wanted to control people, but Alpert wanted to set them free, bring them to the next level of evolution. Because of this disagreement, he left the C.I.A. project and joined the \\"Hairies\\" on The Farm in New York, where he conducted his experiments on people with the chemicals developed by him in his lab, but their experiments went awry, turning them into wild, violent creatures, disgusting Bekka, the Wonder Woman. Thanks to Bekka's crystal gems created by her Mother Box, Doctor Psycho advanced in his experiments, but his misrepresented goals turned people in his lab into monsters. Despite this he founded The Eternity Institute in Switzerland and all he'd achieved—the extraordinary advances in science, medicine and technology—over the next forty years Alpert became a notorious recluse, never being seen in public and secretly harvesting DNA of the Justice League. He was the one who created the Forever People, claiming to be the result of his efforts to develop humanity and lead them to a new world of peace and order, devoting to wipe out disease, poverty and war. But beneath all a veneer of goodness and altruism lay the essence of a greedy man, and in his dying days, evolved into Imperiex using DNA of the League and the Forever Formula. He was defeated and Bekka killed the evil doctor with her sword.Justice League: Gods and Monsters #2 In other media =Television= * \\"Doctor Psycho\\" is the title of the fourth episode of the fourth season of the TV series Orange Is the New Black. Two characters exchange dialogue about Wonder Woman, and one of the characters later refers to another as Doctor Psycho, to which the other replies \\"the one who hates women!\\" * Doctor Psycho appears in Powerless episode \\"Emergency Punch-Up\\", portrayed by an uncredited Ronnie Zappa. In the show, he appears as a subject of a documentary about supervillains. Later on, a reporter tells the story that Doctor Psycho has released a dangerous gas which causes Wayne Security to go on lockdown until the all clear can be given. * Doctor Psycho made his animated debut as a regular character in the DC Universe's adult animated series Harley Quinn, voiced by Tony Hale. According to the character description, he is \\"an angry misogynist dwarf with telekinesis\\" rejected by other supervillains after calling Wonder Woman and Giganta \\"the C-word\\" on live television. He was married to the latter and they have a seemingly normal teenage son named Herman (voiced by Mark Whitten), but Giganta divorces him after learning he used his mind-control to make her love him, taking custody of Herman. After being kicked out of the Legion of Doom by Lex Luthor as a result of what happened, Psycho reluctantly joins forces with Harley Quinn in order to get back into the world of supervillainy. In the episode \\"You're a Damn Good Cop, Jim Gordon\\", Psycho and Poison Ivy seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic after he slandered them, only to discover it is Herman, who is bitter about his father abusing him. Doctor Psycho explains he was trying to inspire Herman to grow up to be a supervillain and admits he is proud of his son for critiquing supervillains; allowing them to reconcile. While he remained by his newfound allies' side through most of the show, in the episode \\"Inner (Para) Demons\\", Psycho becomes enraged with Harley after she gains control of a Parademon army from Darkseid, only to relinquish control of them. He quits the crew so he can seek revenge against Harley and conquer the Earth for himself, starting with Gotham City. In \\"Dye Hard\\", he strikes a partnership with the Riddler and releases him from Harley's crew's custody to help him steal a mind control helmet to strengthen his powers so he can enslave the Parademons left in Gotham. He succeeds in conquering Gotham, but fails to kill Harley due to Sy Borgman sacrificing himself to help her escape. In \\"A Fight Worth Fighting For\\", Psycho strikes a deal with Darkseid to kill Harley in exchange for an army large enough to take over the world, and enslaves Poison Ivy; sending her to kill Harley. Psycho also tells Darkseid how he suffers from a Napoleon complex since he was a child, as he was not allowed to ride a Ferris wheel due to his short stature, and that he decided to become a villain after the ferris wheel collapsed and he realized he enjoyed seeing other people suffer. In \\"Lovers' Quarrel\\", Psycho is defeated by the combined efforts of Harley, Ivy after she was released from his control, and the Justice League, but he retaliates by showing Ivy's memory of her having sex with Harley to everyone in Gotham to embarrass them. He was subsequently sent to Arkham Asylum in the season two finale, \\"The Runaway Bridesmaid\\". =Video games= * Doctor Psycho appears in DC Universe Online. He is seen as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains and is shown running an experimental facility within Metropolis General Hospital funded by LexCorp.

Roslyn Walker, one of very few UK sideshow entertainers, gives a close-up of the human blockhead using a 6 inch nail. A human blockhead is a carnival or sideshow performer who hammers a nail or other implement (such as an awl or screwdriver) into his or her nasal cavity via the nostril. The stunt is often shocking to audiences, who believe that the nail is being hammered into the skull itself. In reality, the stunt plays on the anatomical misconception that the nasal cavity goes upward, rather than straight back. The performer merely learns the terrain of the nasal cavity and lessens his or her sensitivity (and urge to sneeze) until the implement can be slid straight back through the nasal cavity until it hits the back of the throat. The use of a hammer merely adds to the shock value by creating the illusion that the nail is being pounded through bone. Some performers have gone so far as to use a power drill. Herbie Hatman, of the 999 eyes carnival sideshow, blockheads a butter knife This stunt is said to have been developed by renowned magician and sideshow performer Melvin Burkhart (1907–2001)Elizabeth Gilbert: The Lives They Live: Melvin Burkhart, B. 1907; Life as a Blockhead, The New York Times, Dec. 30, 2001Douglas Martin: Melvin Burkhart, 94, 'Human Blockhead', dies, International Herald Tribune, Nov. 19, 2001 after his nose was broken in a boxing bout and he became fascinated by the way that the doctors inserted instruments into his nose. Since then, it has become one of the staple acts of the sideshow. Over the years, several variations of the act have been developed by numerous performers, using objects including running power drills, fireworks, lit fire-eating rods, condoms, balloons, cork screws, letter openers, straws, spoons, forks, and much more. In 2005, scientific skeptic and investigator James Randi criticized faith healer John of God of Brazil for his use of this carnival trick to convince unsuspecting people, some desperately ill, of his paranormal healing powers. Randi and others also criticized news media outlets ABC, CNN, and Oprah Winfrey for uncritically promoting the faith healer's quackery. On November 23, 2009, The National Geographic Channel's Humanly Impossible series aired an episode \\"Human Blockhead\\" examining this trick with a visual camera probe inserted through the nostril and up to four inches into the sinus cavity. One example of a variation of the original Human Blockhead act is the \\"Human Meathead\\", created in 2000 by Ryan Stock. The performer displays a large meat hook and then proceeds to force it into the nostril, through his nasal cavity and out his mouth. When performing this stunt, Ryan Stock has said that he had suspended up to 70lbs from the end of the inserted hook. In 2017, Zak Crouch, of Tinderbox Circus Sideshow, created a variation on the Human Blockhead with a gurn. He is able to do this by utilizing a stretched labret piercing and by removing his full dentures. He is currently the only professional sideshow performer in the industry that is able to perform this variation.

The airport is non-towered, but has a mandatory frequency linked remotely to the flight service station (FSS) located in Mont- Joli. There are instrument approaches available for poor weather. Both the city and airport are located in a valley that is oriented in a more or less east-west direction, with the eastern end open to the ocean and the western end terminating in the highlands. For this reason, most small (i.e. unpressurized) aircraft prefer to approach from the east, thereby avoiding the steep descent over the high hills to the west. History Transport Canada began construction of the airport in 1965, and handed control to the municipality in 1967 (while continuing to subsidize the airport). The airport added a terminal building in 1972, and a hangar and flight service station in 1974. The hangar was destroyed by a fire in 1978 and rebuilt in 1979; the flight service station has subsequently been closed. In 1983, Transport Canada installed navigation aids (the airport has both a VOR and a LOC), and formally handed full control of the airport over to the municipality in 1998 as a result of the National Airports Policy.

He is a member of the Evil Warriors, he appears to be a hybrid between a man and a crab or lobster, with large, sharp claws that can crush the life out of his opponents. In most media, his right claw is extra large and thus achieves an extra-deadly grip. Character history =1980s= Clawful was introduced into the Masters of the Universe toy line in 1984 as part of the third wave of figures. He uses the standard Evil Warrior \\"Skeletor\\" body, with a new head and right arm sculpt (with spring-loaded claw). His left arm uses the same mold as Buzz-Off, released in the same wave. He carries a bright green version of the mace weapon originally included in the Castle Grayskull playset, with an additional 'handle' allowing him to carry it in his left claw. There are two versions of the Clawful figure. One uses the \\"bumpy legs\\" mold used with other figures such as Buzz-Off. The second version uses the standard Evil Warrior 'claw' leg mold. Additionally, typical examples of the figure have a 'squeezable' soft heads, but some examples can be found with harder, rubber heads. However, unlike most third wave figures, which did not make appearances in the cartoon series until the show's second season, Clawful makes his debut on the accompanying cartoon series by Filmation in 1983, late into the show's first season. His appearance on the cartoon is significantly different from the appearance of his action figure. His fin like spikes down the back of his head stick more than the pointy bumps on the back of his toy counterpart, which makes his head look almost reptile (or even dragon) like and unlike the action figure. This could possibly be due to his animated design being based on a very early prototype of the figure, which would explain some of the differences in appearance (or more likely, the possible danger of kids playing with spiky toys). Additionally, both his claws are the same size, the reason for this being to make his character symmetrical so animation cels could be flipped over without his large claw constantly switching sides. Introduced in the episode \\"Dree Elle's Return\\", Clawful receives a strong introduction as lead villain of the episode. Having stolen an artifact called the Horn of Evil from Orko's homeworld of Trolla, Clawful is portrayed as a strong, harsh commander to the bumbling Trap-Jaw who assists him throughout the episode. He makes his second appearance a few episodes later in \\"Castle of Heroes\\" in which Skeletor describes him as his \\"right-hand man\\" and he is portrayed as such throughout the episode, as a loyal sidekick to Skeletor, whom Skeletor seems to respect more than most of his other warriors. Although his introduction seems to indicate he is a rung above the other villains, this is not expanded upon throughout his later appearances, most of which portray him as just another of Skeletor's henchmen, albeit more intelligent and slightly more responsible than most others. His most prominent episode of the show's second season is \\"Things That Go Bump in the Night\\", which indicates that Skeletor's apparent respect for him, as demonstrated in \\"Castle of Heroes\\", has waned, as Skeletor is shown to be aggressive and distrustful towards Clawful, who in this episode vows that he will someday overthrow Skeletor as leader of the Evil Warriors. Clawful seems to possess more confidence than Skeletor's other minions in that out of all of the Evil Warriors who make this statement for themselves throughout the series, Clawful is the only one bold enough to say it to Skeletor's face, and he is also seen to sarcastically laugh off Skeletor's abuse with a confidence few other evil warriors ever exhibit. =2002 series= Clawful is re-used in the 2002 relaunch of the Masters of the Universe cartoon series. Despite being one of the first characters designed by the Four Horsemen for the new toyline, the line was canceled before his figure could be released. In 2004, a mini statue of the character was produced by NECA. Clawful's portrayal in the modern incarnation is radically different from his 1980s counterpart. Rather than being one of Skeletor's more intelligent and responsible villains, Clawful is presented as being the stupidest and most bumbling of them all, used purely for comedy value without the faintest hint of intelligence. Although he appears frequently throughout the series, his roles are generally minimal, only serving to contribute the occasional comical moment with his dim-witted statements and bunglings of schemes. The only episode to give him a spotlight role is \\"The Island\\", in which we are introduced to his race, a race of crab- like creatures who populate a small island. Clawful's cousin plays a larger role than Clawful in this episode, and also seems significantly more intelligent. Clawful is shown to be so dim-witted that he does not even recognize the long-range communications of his own race: Morse-code-like messages relayed via a snapping of the claws.

The Polochic River is the largest river that drains into the lake. The lake, which is only a metre above sea level, drains into the Gulf of Honduras of the Caribbean Sea through the smaller Golfete Dulce, which is at sea level, and the navigable Rio Dulce. The well preserved colonial Castillo de San Felipe de Lara guarded this lake against pirate attacks, and there are some ancient sunken ships nearby. It is home to several species including the Manatee, Jaguar, Spider Monkey, Blue Eye Cichlids, and Howler Monkey, and is a popular place for birdwatching.  Culture  There are many indigenous communities surrounding the lake, namely the Mayas Q'eqchi'. The fish in the lake are a major source of nutrition in these people's diet. An aquatic plant known as Hydrilla, which has both positive and negative effects on the ecosystem, has been shown to nourish the existing fish species. The Castle of San Felipe de Lara: This castle, constructed in 1652 in honor of Judge Antonio Lara Mangravo, was built to protect the region from pirates. The castle is equipped with cannons and a sturdy framework throughout.  Controversy  Surrounding Lake Izabal are mountains that contain an abundance of nickel. Although nickel mines have been a source of environmental contamination in other countries, the government of Guatemala has granted licenses for nickel exploitation. As in other countries, this endeavor could pollute the lake resulting in environmental degradation, economic repercussions, and a potential decline in tourism. In a similar yet ironic way, the giant grebe bird (known as \\"poc\\" in Mayan) that used to live around Lake Atitlán, a lake that lies approximately 209 km (130 mi) away, is now extinct due to the creation of a resort, demonstrating the potential consequences of mining for Lake Izabal. Among the many companies that are involved in this business are the Guatemalan Nickel Company, a foreign private multinational company, and Skye Resources, a Canadian business. Another Canadian mining company, the Anfield Nickel Corporation, was granted a 25-year mining license to extract 100% of the nickel they find in the designated area. Through one way or another these two companies have gained possession of the mining territory for 120 USD per square kilometer. Additionally, they, and other foreign mining companies, have only needed to pay Guatemala a mere 1% in taxes of what they retrieve; this has raised suspicions about whether these mining companies have used bribes to obtain such generous transactions.

It features the eponymous Augie March who grows up during the Great Depression and it is an example of Bildungsroman, tracing the development of an individual through a series of encounters, occupations and relationships from boyhood to manhood. The Adventures of Augie March won the 1954 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. [NBF]. \\"National Book Awards – 1954\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-30. (With essay by Nathaniel Rich from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) Both Time magazine and the Modern Library Board named it one of the hundred best novels in the English language. The novel When the Swedish Academy awarded Bellow the 1976 Nobel Prize in literature, their press release noted that his novels, including Augie March, use a picaresque style that dates back to the earliest origins of the European novel. However, according to the Academy, Bellow uses this episodic traditional form to investigate modern concerns: \\"the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.\\"Swedish Academy. \\"The Nobel Prize in Literature 1976: Saul Bellow.\\" Press Release. With an intricate plot and allusive style, he explores contrasting themes of alienation and belonging, poverty and wealth, love and loss, with often comic undertones. Its protagonist may be said to represent the modern Everyman—an individual struggling to make sense of, and succeed in, an alienating world. The novel is also specific to the American literary canon in that it celebrates the capacity of the individual to progress in society by virtue of nothing more than his own \\"luck and pluck.\\" This idea is stated explicitly in the opening and most famous lines of the novel, in which the narrator defines himself as an American. This was an important act of self-definition for the author and narrator, both immigrants to America. It also establishes the dual meaning of \\"America\\" in the novel: that is, the physical and political \\"America,\\" as well as the more figurative \\"American\\" as a state-of-mind: This celebration of the individual determines Bellow's presentation of fate in the novel. Unlike other picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones, the plot of Augie March is never pre-determined. Things simply happen to Augie, one after another, with no evident story arc or hint as to where his adventures are leading. This contributes to the sense that Augie, as the Everyman, is lost in a chaotic world, but it also enhances the sense that the Everyman, as an autonomous creation, is in control of his own fate. By turns, Bellow exposes the alienating forces of the American city, while revealing the great opportunities that it offers. Plot summary The story describes Augie March's growth from childhood to a fairly stable maturity. Augie, with his brother Simon and the mentally abnormal George have no father and are brought up by their mother who is losing her eyesight, and a tyrannical grandmother- like boarder in very humble circumstances in the rough parts of Chicago. Augie drifts from one situation to another in a free-wheeling manner—jobs, women, homes, education and lifestyle. Augie March's path seems to be partly self- made and partly comes around through chance. In lifestyle he ranges from near adoption by a wealthy couple who spoil him, to a struggle for existence stealing books and helping out friends in desperate straits. His most unusual adventure is his flight to Mexico with the wild and irrepressible Thea who tries to catch lizards with an eagle. Thea attempts to convince Augie to join her in this seemingly impossible task. His jobs include general assistance to the slightly corrupt Einhorn, helping in a dog training parlor, working for his brother at a coal-tip, and working for the Congress of Industrial Organizations until finally he joins the merchant navy in the war. Augie attracts and gets involved with a string of different women. Firstly a casual acquaintance as a youth, he gets engaged to a wealthy cousin of his brother's wife. However, through a scandal not of his fault, he is discarded. After a casual affair with Sophie, a Greek hotel maid, he is swept off by Thea, whom he had met when living with the rich Renlings and who forecast their relationship even though he loved her sister. After the fiasco in Mexico, where he suffered a terrible accident on a horse, he and Thea began drifting apart; he spending his time playing cards and she hunting for snakes and lizards in the mountains. Their inevitable split came the night he agreed to drive another woman, Stella, to another town to escape her troubled boyfriend. After the break-up, Augie returned to Chicago and picked back up with Sophie until joining the merchant navy and heading to New York. There he met up with Stella again and married her. All through the book, Augie is encouraged into education, but never quite seems to make it; he reads a great deal for himself and develops a philosophy of life. Something or somebody always tends to crop up, turning his path before Augie seriously considers returning to education. During the war, his ship is sunk and he suffers a difficult episode in a lifeboat with a man who turns out to be a lunatic. After rescue, he returns to Stella and the book ends with them living a slightly dubious existence in France, he involved in some fairly shady business deals and she attempting to pursue a career in acting. Literary significance and criticism In some ways, The Adventures of Augie March is seen as a dispelling of the traditional idea of an American hero.

However, despite these advantages, Augie does not truly live out the life of a hero. He has no commitments of his own, and merely goes along with plans and schemes developed by others. He never truly decides what he wants to do with himself, and \\"manages a deep enthusiasm just twice in the novel: he falls in love twice...The first experience fails completely; and the second, as the novels ends, is failing.\\" Everyone around Augie finds a greater measure of success than he because they commit themselves to some pursuit or goal, even if it is not the most noble. Ultimately, though Augie has every chance to succeed in the world, he never does so because he refuses to engage in that world, and instead keeps chasing the vague \\"better fate\\" he has convinced himself he deserves. Through this Bellow makes his case that a sharp mind and pure ideals are of no value if they are not coupled with active pursuit and a clear understanding of one's relationship with others.

An immediate goal of the scandal seems to have been reversing President Richard Nixon's decision to withdraw troops from South Korea. It involved the Korea Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) allegedly funneling bribes and favors through Korean businessman Tongsun Park in an attempt to gain favor and influence for South Korean objectives.Boettcher, Robert B. (1980). Gifts of Deceit.Irving Louis Horowitz, Science, Sin, and Society: The Politics or Reverend Moon and the Unification Church , 1980, MIT Press Park fled the United States and the South Korean government refused to send him back unless he received immunity. Immunity was refused and Park remained in Korea. In the end, two members of Congress were charged with crimes: Representative Richard T. Hanna of California and Representative Otto E. Passman of Louisiana. Passman was acquitted after a trial. Hanna pled guilty and served one year in prison. Three other congressmen were reprimanded by the House.Mark Grossman, Political Corruption in America: In encyclopedia of scandals, power, and greed (2003) p. 208. Parties involved Tongsun Park and U.S. Congressman Richard T. Hanna (D-CA) were two of the main actors involved in the Koreagate scandal. Tongsun Park represented the Korean side of the secret agreement, while Richard Hanna was largely responsible for the American side of the deal. According to the agreement, both parties would share the commissions from American rice sales to South Korea and to use them to obtain favorable decisions for Seoul in the United States Congress.Chae. J. Lee dynamics of adjustment, p. 95. Hanna was responsible for aiding Chung Il Kwon and Park in finding effective lobbying techniques, which he did by advising the pair to emulate Taiwanese and Israeli models that had succeeded in the past.Lee koreagate investigations, p. 95. Park was also responsible for providing extra financial incentives to Hanna and other members of Congress, a task made easy by large rice sale commissions.Koreagate on Capitol Hill Time, p. 2. Such financial incentives reportedly ranged from US$100,000 to $200,000 at a time per individual. Some 115 members of Congress were supposedly involved. Speculation also focused on the role of Unification movement founder Sun Myung Moon, former KCIA Director Kim Hyong-uk, and former South Korean Prime Minister Chung Il-kwon. Objectives The reasons behind the scandal involved political, social, and financial motivations. Korean leaders, including Tongsun Park and President Park, were angered with Nixon's decision to withdraw soldiers from South Korea and felt it was urgent to build support for preserving the remaining United States military presence.C. Lee political notions of scandal, p. 96. The Park government was also concerned with the approval of a substantial package of assistance for South Korea's military modernization programs.C. Lee financial notions of scandal p. 96. Another reason behind the scandal was to repress or counter increasing criticism of Park's illegitimate policies and human rights violations.C. Lee Social Notions of Scandal p. 96. According to many, the deceitfulness of Park's objectives would ultimately lead to his downfall.Koreagate on Capitol Hill Time p. 3. Consequences The United States Department of State recognized the illegal aspects of Park's action in 1970 and informed the Korean embassy in Washington that such activities were problematic.Lee A Troubled Peace reactions to actions p. 97. Former United States Ambassador to the Republic of Korea William Porter tried to persuade South Korean President Park Chung-hee and Chung Il Kwon that Tongsun Park should have to return to South Korea, but to no avail.Lee Porter's concern on ethics p. 98. Later, William Porter described the United States response as \\"greatly pessimistic\\" because the United States government did not want to denounce South Korea when it was assisting war efforts in Vietnam.Purdum Government bias to withhold punishment p. 2. Following the replacement of William Porter by Philip Habib as ambassador to South Korea, punishment for Tongsun Park's unethical activities was increasingly pursued.Unethical description of behavior Time p. 3. Habib attempted to force Park to register as a lobbyist for the South Korean government, but was unsuccessful. In response to his failure, Habib instructed all embassy personnel in South Korea to cut ties with Park and warned several visiting congressmen about his illegal operations, only to be crossed by former Attorney General William Saxbe who warned Park of these actions and his potential prosecution.Lee A Troubled Peace p. 99. Shortly after Porter and Habib's attempts to condemn Tongsun Park's actions, Habib accepted another job opportunity which forced him to work abroad for three years,Lee Consequences on hold p. 99. which once again left Park's fate uncertain. Diplomatic relations After Koreagate was publicized, political relations between the United States and South Korea became shaky at best. Animosity between the United States and South Korea was further aggravated by mutual misperceptions and procedural disagreements.Lee Dynamics of Structural Adjustment p. 99. The United States adopted a legalistic platform and expected South Korea to cooperate with any pending investigations.Lee Koreagate Investigations p. 99. On the other hand, South Korean officials believed the story had been exaggerated, spun, or even concocted by American journalists.Lee Diplomatic Sparring p. 99. Furthermore, South Korea interpreted American action as arising from an anti-Park conspiracy. Political experts on both sides also suspected that the scandal was being framed in this manner to aid Gerald Ford's election strategy. According to this interpretation, the Ford administration intended to neutralize the Democratic Party's exploitation of Watergate and Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon as issues by linking key Democratic congressmen to the Koreagate operations.Lee Diplomatic Sparring p. 100. Results Despite persistent disagreement about extradition between the United States and South Korea, Tongsun Park ultimately came to the United States in April 1978 to testify publicly in a House hearing.Dobbs on Koreagate p. 1. During the testimony, Park admitted to disbursing cash to thirty members of Congress. Ten members of Congress were implicated, of whom most decided to resign, while the statute of limitations expired for three. Park was granted full immunity for his testimony. Congressional members Edward Roybal (D-CA), Charles H. Wilson (D-CA) and John J. McFall (D-CA) were censured and reprimanded;Dobbs Congressional Bad Boys p. 1. Congressman Edward J. Patten (D-NJ) was found not guilty, and Otto Passman (D-LA) was indicted on bribery, conspiracy, illegal gratuities and tax evasion. He was tried in his home district in Monroe, Louisiana and was acquitted. Richard Hanna was convicted and sentenced to six to thirty months in prison.

It is widely regarded as the cornerstone document on human research ethics.WMA Press Release: WMA revises the Declaration of Helsinki. 9 October 2000 It is not a legally binding instrument under the international law, but instead draws its authority from the degree to which it has been codified in, or influenced, national or regional legislation and regulations. Its role was described by a Brazilian forum in 2000 in these words \\"Even though the Declaration of Helsinki is the responsibility of the World Medical Association, the document should be considered the property of all humanity\\". Principles The Declaration is morally binding on physicians, and that obligation overrides any national or local laws or regulations, if the Declaration provides for a higher standard of protection of humans than the latter. Investigators still have to abide by local legislation but will be held to the higher standard. =Basic principles= The fundamental principle is respect for the individual (Article 8), his right to self-determination and the right to make informed decisions (Articles 20, 21 and 22) regarding participation in research, both initially and during the course of the research. The investigator's duty is solely to the patient (Articles 2, 3 and 10) or volunteer (Articles 16, 18), and while there is always a need for research (Article 6), the subject's welfare must always take precedence over the interests of science and society (Article 5), and ethical considerations must always take precedence over laws and regulations (Article 9). The recognition of the increased vulnerability of individuals and groups calls for special vigilance (Article 8). It is recognized that when the research participant is incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, or is a minor (Articles 23, 24), then allowance should be considered for surrogate consent by an individual acting in the subject's best interest, although his consent should still be obtained if at all possible (Article 25). =Operational principles= Research should be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific background (Article 11), a careful assessment of risks and benefits (Articles 16, 17), have a reasonable likelihood of benefit to the population studied (Article 19) and be conducted by suitably trained investigators (Article 15) using approved protocols, subject to independent ethical review and oversight by a properly convened committee (Article 13). The protocol should address the ethical issues and indicate that it is in compliance with the Declaration (Article 14). Studies should be discontinued if the available information indicates that the original considerations are no longer satisfied (Article 17). Information regarding the study should be publicly available (Article 16). Ethical publications extend to publication of the results and consideration of any potential conflict of interest (Article 27). Experimental investigations should always be compared against the best methods, but under certain circumstances a placebo or no treatment group may be utilised (Article 29). The interests of the subject after the study is completed should be part of the overall ethical assessment, including assuring their access to the best proven care (Article 30). Wherever possible unproven methods should be tested in the context of research where there is reasonable belief of possible benefit (Article 32). =Additional guidelines or regulations= Investigators often find themselves in the position of having to follow several different codes or guidelines, and are therefore required to understand the differences between them. One of these is Good Clinical Practice (GCP), an international guide, while each country may also have local regulations such as the Common Rule in the US, in addition to the requirements of the FDA and Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) in that country. There are a number of available tools which compare these. Other countries have guides with similar roles, such as the Tri-Council Policy Statement in Canada. Additional international guidelines include those of the CIOMS, Nuffield Council and UNESCO. History The Declaration was originally adopted in June 1964 in Helsinki, Finland, and has since undergone seven revisions (the most recent at the General Assembly in October 2013) and two clarifications, growing considerably in length from 11 paragraphs in 1964 to 37 in the 2013 version. The Declaration is an important document in the history of research ethics as it is the first significant effort of the medical community to regulate research itself, and forms the basis of most subsequent documents. Prior to the 1947 Nuremberg Code there was no generally accepted code of conduct governing the ethical aspects of human research, although some countries, notably Germany and Russia, had national policies [3a]. The Declaration developed the ten principles first stated in the Nuremberg Code, and tied them to the Declaration of Geneva (1948), a statement of physicians' ethical duties. The Declaration more specifically addressed clinical research, reflecting changes in medical practice from the term 'Human Experimentation used in the Nuremberg Code. A notable change from the Nuremberg Code was a relaxation of the conditions of consent, which was 'absolutely essential' under Nuremberg. Now doctors were asked to obtain consent 'if at all possible' and research was allowed without consent where a proxy consent, such as a legal guardian, was available (Article II.1). =First revision (1975)= The 1975 revision was almost twice the length of the original. It clearly stated that \\"concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.\\"Vanderpool, Harold Y. (1996). The Ethics of Research Involving Human Subjects: Facing the 21st Century. Frederick, Maryland: University Publishing Group, Inc. p. 85. It also introduced the concept of oversight by an 'independent committee' (Article I.2) which became a system of Institutional Review Boards (IRB) in the US, and research ethics committees or ethical review boards in other countries. In the United States regulations governing IRBs came into effect in 1981 and are now encapsulated in the Common Rule. Informed consent was developed further, made more prescriptive and partly moved from 'Medical Research Combined with Professional Care' into the first section (Basic Principles), with the burden of proof for not requiring consent being placed on the investigator to justify to the committee. 'Legal guardian' was replaced with 'responsible relative'. The duty to the individual was given primacy over that to society (Article I.5), and concepts of publication ethics were introduced (Article I.8). Any experimental manoeuvre was to be compared to the best available care as a comparator (Article II.2), and access to such care was assured (Article I.3). The document was also made gender neutral. =Second to Fourth revisions (1975-2000)= Subsequent revisions between 1975 and 2000 were relatively minor, so the 1975 version was effectively that which governed research over a quarter of a century of relative stability. Second and Third Revisions (1983, 1989) The second revision (1983) included seeking the consent of minors where possible. The third revision (1989) dealt further with the function and structure of the independent committee. However, from 1993 onwards, the Declaration was not alone as a universal guide since CIOMS and the World Health Organization (WHO) had also developed their International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects. Fourth revision (1996) =Background= The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study 076 of 100 Zidovudine in maternal- infant transmission of HIV had been published in 1994. This was a placebo controlled trial which showed a reduction of nearly 70% in the risk of transmission, and Zidovudine became a de facto standard of care. The subsequent initiation of further placebo controlled trials carried out in developing countries and funded by the United States Centers for Disease Control or National Institutes of Health raised considerable concern when it was learned that patients in trials in the US had essentially unrestricted access to the drug, while those in developing countries did not. Justification was provided by a 1994 WHO group in Geneva which concluded \\"Placebo-controlled trials offer the best option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of alternative antiretroviral drug regimens to prevent transmission of HIV\\". These trials appeared to be in direct conflict with recently published guidelines for international research by CIOMS, which stated \\"The ethical standards applied should be no less exacting than they would be in the case of research carried out in country\\", referring to the sponsoring or initiating country. In fact a schism between ethical universalism and ethical pluralism was already apparent before the 1993 revision of the CIOMS guidelines. =Fourth revision= In retrospect, this was one of the most significant revisions because it added the phrase \\"This does not exclude the use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method exists\\" to Article II.3 (\\"In any medical study, every patient--including those of a control group, if any—should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.\\"). Critics claimed that the Zidovudine trials in developing countries were in breach of this because Zidovudine was now the best proven treatment and the placebo group should have been given it. This led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ignoring this and all subsequent revisions.Temple R. Impact of the Declaration of Helsinki on medical research from a regulatory perspective. Address to the Scientific Session, World Medical Association General Assembly, September 2003. =Fifth revision (2000)= Background Following the fourth revision in 1996 pressure began to build almost immediately for a more fundamental approach to revising the declaration. The later revision in 2000 would go on to require monitoring of scientific research on human subjects to assure ethical standards were being met. In 1997 Lurie and Wolfe published their seminal paper on HIV trials, raising awareness of a number of central issues. These included the claims that the continuing trials in developing countries were unethical, and pointing out a fundamental discrepancy in decisions to change the study design in Thailand but not Africa. The issue of the use of placebo in turn raised questions about the standard of care in developing counties and whether, as Marcia Angell wrote \\"Human subjects in any part of the world should be protected by an irreducible set of ethical standards\\" (1988). The American Medical Association put forward a proposed revision in November that year,General Assembly WMA Hamburg, Germany 1997 and a proposed revision (17.C/Rev1/99) was circulated the following year, causing considerable debate and resulting in a number of symposia and conferences. Recommendations included limiting the document to basic guiding principles. Many editorials and commentaries were published reflecting a variety of views including concerns that the Declaration was being weakened by a shift towards efficiency-based and utilitarian standards (Rothman, Michaels and Baum 2000), and an entire issue of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics was devoted to the debate. Others saw it as an example of Angell's 'Ethical Imperialism', an imposition of US needs on the developing world, and resisted any but the most minor changes, or even a partitioned document with firm principles and commentaries, as used by CIOMS. The idea of ethical imperialism was brought into high attention with HIV testing, as it was strongly debated from 1996-2000 because of its centrality to the issue of regimens to prevent its vertical transmission. Brennan summarises this by stating \\"The principles exemplified by the current Declaration of Helsinki represent a delicate compromise that we should modify only after careful deliberation\\". Nevertheless, what had started as a controversy over a specific series of trials and their designs in Sub-Saharan Africa, now had potential implications for all research. These implications further came into public view since the Helsinki declaration had stated, \\"In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgement, it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering.\\" Fifth revision Even though most meetings about the proposed revisions failed to achieve consensus, and many argued that the declaration should remain unchanged or only minimally altered, after extensive consultation the Workgroup Nancy Dickey, Kati Myllymäki, Judith Kazimirsky eventually came up with a text that was endorsed by WMA's Council and passed by the General Assembly on October 7, 2000, and which proved to be the most far reaching and contentious revision to date. The justification for this was partly to take account of expanded scope of biomedical research since 1975.Riis P. Perspectives on the fifth revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. JAMA 2000 Dec 20 284(23): 3045-6 This involved a restructuring of the document, including renumbering and re-ordering of all the articles, the changes in which are outlined in this Table. The Introduction establishes the rights of subjects and describes the inherent tension between the need for research to improve the common good, and the rights of the individual. The Basic Principles establish a guide for judging to what extent proposed research meets the expected ethical standards. The distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research introduced in the original document, criticised by Levine was removed to emphasise the more general application of ethical principles, but the application of the principles to healthy volunteers is spelt out in Articles 18-9, and they are referred to in Article 8 ('those who will not benefit personally from the research') as being especially vulnerable. The scope of ethical review was increased to include human tissue and data (Article 1), the necessity to challenge accepted care was added (Article 6), as well as establishing the primacy of the ethical requirements over laws and regulations (Article 9). Amongst the many changes was an increased emphasis on the need to benefit the communities in which research is undertaken, and to draw attention to the ethical problems of experimenting on those who would not benefit from the research, such as developing countries in which innovative medications would not be available. Article 19 first introduces the concept of social justice, and extends the scope from individuals to the community as a whole by stating that 'research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research'. This new role for the Declaration has been both denounced and praised, Macklin R. Future challenges for the Declaration of Helsinki: Maintaining credibility in the face of ethical controversies. Address to Scientific Session, World Medical Association General Assembly, September 2003, Helsinki and even considered for a clarification footnote. Article 27 expanded the concept of publication ethics, adding the necessity to disclose conflict of interest (echoed in Articles 13 and 22), and to include publication bias amongst ethically problematic behavior. =Additional Principles= The most controversial revisions (Articles 29, 30) were placed in this new category. These predictably were those that like the fourth revision were related to the ongoing debate in international health research. The discussions indicate that there was felt a need to send a strong signal that exploitation of poor populations as a means to an end, by research from which they would not benefit, was unacceptable. In this sense the Declaration endorsed ethical universalism. Article 29 restates the use of placebo where 'no proven' intervention exists. Surprisingly, although the wording was virtually unchanged, this created far more protest in this revision. The implication being that placebos are not permitted where proven interventions are available. The placebo question was already an active debate prior to the fourth revision but had intensified, while at the same time the placebo question was still causing controversy in the international setting. This revision implies that in choosing a study design, developed-world standards of care should apply to any research conducted on human subjects, including those in developing countries. The wording of the fourth and fifth revisions reflect the position taken by Rothman and Michel and Freedman et al., known as 'active-control orthodoxy'. The opposing view, as expressed by Levine and by Temple and Ellenberg is referred to as 'placebo orthodoxy', insisting that placebo controls are more scientifically efficient and are justifiable where the risk of harm is low. This viewpoint argues that where no standards of care exist, as for instance in developing countries, then placebo-controlled trials are appropriate. The utilitarian argument held that the disadvantage to a few (such as denial of potentially beneficial interventions) was justifiable for the advantage of many future patients. These arguments are intimately tied to the concept of distributive justice, the equitable distribution of the burdens of research. As with much of the Declaration, there is room for interpretation of words. 'Best current' has been variously held to refer to either global or local contexts. Article 30 introduced another new concept, that after the conclusion of the study patients 'should be assured of access to the best proven' intervention arising from the study, a justice issue. Arguments over this have dealt with whether subjects derive benefit from the trial and are no worse off at the end than the status quo prior to the trial, or of not participating, versus the harm of being denied access to that which they have contributed to. There are also operational issues that are unclear. Aftermath Given the lack of consensus on many issues prior to the fifth revision it is no surprise that the debates continued unabated.Williams JR. The promise and limits of international bioethics: Lessons from the recent revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. Int J Bioethics 2004 15(1): 31-42 The debate over these and related issues also revealed differences in perspectives between developed and developing countries. Zion and colleagues (Zion 2000) have attempted to frame the debate more carefully, exploring the broader social and ethical issues and the lived realities of potential subjects' lives as well as acknowledging the limitations of absolute universality in a diverse world, particularly those framed in a context that might be considered elitist and structured by gender and geographic identity. As Macklin points out, both sides may be right, since justice \\"is not an unambiguous concept\\". =Clarifications of Articles 29, 30 (2002-2004)= Eventually Notes of Clarification (footnotes) to articles 29 and 30 were added in 2002 and 2004 respectively, predominantly under pressure from the US (CMAJ 2003, Blackmer 2005). The 2002 clarification to Article 29 was in response to many concerns about WMA's apparent position on placebos. As WMA states in the note, there appeared to be 'diverse interpretations and possibly confusion'. It then outlined circumstances in which a placebo might be 'ethically acceptable', namely 'compelling... methodological reasons', or 'minor conditions' where the 'risk of serious or irreversible harm' was considered low. Effectively this shifted the WMA position to what has been considered a 'middle ground'. Given the previous lack of consensus, this merely shifted the ground of debate, which now extended to the use of the 'or' connector. For this reason the footnote indicates that the wording must be interpreted in the light of all the other principles of the Declaration. Article 30 was debated further at the 2003 meeting, with another proposed clarification but did not result in any convergence of thought, and so decisions were postponed for another year, but again a commitment was made to protecting the vulnerable. A new working group examined article 30, and recommended not amending it in January 2004. Later that year the American Medical Association proposed a further note of clarification that was incorporated. In this clarification the issue of post trial care now became something to consider, not an absolute assurance. Despite these changes, as Macklin predicted, consensus was no closer and the Declaration was considered by some to be out of touch with contemporary thinking, and even the question of the future of the Declaration became a matter for conjecture. =Sixth revision (2008)= The sixth revision cycle commenced in May 2007. This consisted of a call for submissions, completed in August 2007. The terms of reference included only a limited revision compared to 2000. In November 2007 a draft revision was issued for consultation till February 2008, and led to a workshop in Helsinki in March. Those comments were then incorporated into a second draft in May. Further workshops were held in Cairo and São Paulo and the comments collated in August 2008. A final text was then developed by the Working Group for consideration by the Ethics Committee and finally the General Assembly, which approved it on October 18. Public debate was relatively slight compared to previous cycles, and in general supportive. Input was received from a wide number of sources, some of which have been published, such as Feminist Approaches to Bioethics. Others include CIOMS and the US Government. =Seventh revision (2013)= The most recent iteration of Helsinki (2013) was reflective of the controversy regarding the standard of care that arose from the vertical transmission trials. The revised declaration of 2013 also highlights the need to disseminate research results, including negative and inconclusive studies and also includes a requirement for treatment and compensation for injuries related to research. In addition, the updated version is felt to be more relevant to limited resource settings—specifically addressing the need to ensure access to an intervention if it is proven effective. Future The controversies and national divisions over the text have continued. The US FDA rejected the 2000 and subsequent revisions, only recognizing the third (1989) revision, and in 2006 announced it would eliminate all reference to the Declaration. After consultation, which included expressions of concern, a final rule was issued on April 28, 2008 replacing the Declaration of Helsinki with Good Clinical Practice effective October 2008. This has raised a number of concerns regarding the apparent weakening of protections for research subjects outside the United States. Obasogie O. Goozner on the FDA and the Declaration of Helsinki. Biopolitical Times. Center for Genetics and Society May 15th 2008 FDA abandons Declaration of Helsinki for international clinical trials. Social Medicine Portal June 1st 2008 Rennie S. The FDA ditches the Declaration of Helsinki. Global Bioethics Blog May 6 2008. Shah S. FDA Puts Medical Test Subjects in Danger. The Nation May 19, 2008 The NIH training in human subject research participant protection no longer refers to the Declaration of Helsinki.

The European Commission, however, does refer to the 2000 revision.http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/edctp_ethics_en.html#fn1 While the Declaration has been a central document guiding research practice, its future has been called into question. Challenges include the apparent conflict between guides, such as the CIOMS and Nuffield Council documents. Another is whether it should concentrate on basic principles as opposed to being more prescriptive, and hence controversial. It has continually grown and faced more frequent revisions. The recent controversies undermine the authority of the document, as does the apparent desertion by major bodies, and any rewording must embrace deeply and widely held values, since continual shifts in the text do not imply authority. The actual claim to authority, particularly on a global level, by the insertion of the word \\"international\\" in article 10 has been challenged. Carlson raises the question as to whether the document's utility should be more formally evaluated, rather than just relying on tradition.

They are medium to small in size, and are found in the Yucatán Peninsula, Central and South America, and the island of Trinidad. Most species are primarily found in forests. They are superficially similar to the African duikers and the Asian muntjacs, but unrelated. About 10 species of brocket deer are described. The genus name Mazama is derived from Nahuatl mazame, the plural of mazatl \\"deer\\". The common English name \\"brocket\\" (from French brocart < broche, spindle) comes from the word for a stag in its second year, with unbranched antlers.Cf. \\"brocket, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 5 August 2017. Taxonomy The taxonomy among Mazama species has changed significantly in the last decades, and as recently as 1999, some authorities only recognized four species.Nowak, R. M. (eds) (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press. These four \\"species\\", M. americana, M. gouazoubira, M. rufina, and M. chunnyi, included several distinct populations that subsequently were elevated to species status, resulting in a total of nine different species being recognized in Mammal Species of the World in 2005. A tenth species, M. nemorivaga, has traditionally been included in M. gouazoubira, but this was shown to be mistaken in 2000.Rossi, R. V. (2000). Taxonomia de Mazama Rafinesque, 1817 do Brasil (Artiodactyla, Cervidae). M.Sc. Thesis, Universidade de São Paulo. M. nemorivaga was not recognized as a separate species in Mammal Species of the World, but this was apparently in error.. Yet another species, the fair brocket (M. tienhoveni), has recently been described from the lower Amazon basin.Marc G.M. van Roosmalen (2015). \\"Hotspot of new megafauna found in the Central Amazon: the lower Rio Aripuanã Basin\\" (PDF). Biodiversity Journal. 6 (1): 219–244. What may be an undescribed small species of brocket with a reddish coat and blackish legs has been photographed in the lowlands of Manú National Park in Peru, and based on sight records may also occur in northwestern Bolivia.Trolle, M., and L. H. Emmons (2004). A record of a dwarf brocket from lowland Madre de Dios, Peru. Deer Specialist Group Newsletter 19: 2-5 Molecular dating suggests that the family Cervidae originated and radiated in central Asia during the Late Miocene, and that the Odocoileini dispersed to North America during the Miocene/Pliocene boundary and underwent an adaptive radiation in South America after their Pliocene dispersal across the Isthmus of Panama.Gilbert, C., Ropiquet, A., and Hassanin, A. 2006. Mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies of Cervidae (Mammalia, Ruminantia): Systematics, morphology, and biogeography. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 40:101-117 According to the systematic relationships and evolutionary history of neotropical deer, at least eight ancestral forms of deer invaded South America during the late Pliocene (2.5–3 Mya), and members of the red brockets had an independent early explosive diversification soon after their ancestor arrived there, giving rise to a number of morphologically cryptic species. Deer endemic to the New World fall in two biogeographic lineages: the first, which includes genus Odocoileus and Mazama americana, is distributed in North, Central, and South America, whereas the second is composed of South American species only and includes Mazama gouazoubira. This implies that the genus Mazama is not a monophyletic taxon.Duarte, J. M. B., González, S. and Maldonado, J. E. 2008. The surprising evolutionary history of South American deer. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 49:17-22 Genetic analysis reveals high levels of molecular and cytogenetic divergence between groups of morphologically similar species of brockets (Mazama) and suggests a polyphyletic origin. In particular, M. americana showed a striking kinship with Odocoileus on the basis of several DNA sequences, in contrast to that expected, since this M. americana (now M. temama) haplotype, of Mexican origin, was not close to several Bolivian Mazama sequences analyzed. Thus, Mazama as traditionally circumscribed may not be monophyletic. These Bolivian Mazama species were instead grouped with Pudu puda and Ozotoceros bezoarticus. This could be explained by various possibilities, among them the existence of common ancestral haplotypes among the species or the need for a revised phylogenetic tree, with revised placement into true monophyletic genera that better reflect the true ancestry.Ruiz-García, M., Randi, E., Martínez-Agüero, M. and Alvarez, D. 2007.

When present, the antlers are small, simple spikes. The pelage varies from reddish to brown to gray. Very roughly, the species can be divided into four groups based on size, color, and habitat (but not necessarily matching their phylogeny): * M. americana and M. temama are usually found in forest. They are relatively large to medium brocket deer with a reddish to reddish-brown pelage. The head, neck, and legs are often grayish or blackish. * M. gouazoubira, M. nemorivaga, and M. pandora are found in forest, woodland, and shrubland. They are medium-sized with a brownish to grayish pelage and pale underparts.Medellín, R. A., A. L. Gardner, J. M. Aranda (1998).

They are medium to small in size, and the pelage is reddish. In most, a part of the legs and the upper part of the head are blackish or dark gray, but in M. chunyi, the foreparts and neck are also blackish or dark gray. * M. bororo is found in Atlantic forest in southeastern Brazil. In appearance, it is intermediate in appearance between M. americana (first group) and M. nana (third group).Vogliotti, A., and J. M. B. Duarte (2009). Discovery of the first wild population of the small red brocket deer Mazama bororo (Artiodactyla: Cervidae). Mastozool. Beotrop. 16(2). Behavior In addition to being small and nocturnal, Mazama species are shy and are thus rarely observed. They are found living alone or in mated pairs within their own small territory, the boundaries usually marked with urine, feces, or secretions from the eye glands. When threatened by predators (primarily the cougar and the jaguar), they use their knowledge of their territory to finding hiding places in nearby vegetation. As herbivores, their diet consists of leaves, fruits, and shoots. Reproduction Mated pairs that live together remain monogamous. Single male deer usually mate with nearby females. When males compete for a mate, they fight by biting and stabbing with their short antlers. Brocket species that live in tropical areas have no fixed mating season, but those in temperate areas have a distinct rutting period in the autumn. The gestation period is roughly 200-220 days and females bear only one fawn at a time. The young stay with the mother, keeping concealed until large enough to accompany her. They are normally weaned around six months of age and reach sexual maturity after a year.

History of the school and its site The school was founded by Monmouthshire County Council in 1964, as St Kingsmark School and Community College. Its name was later changed to Chepstow School.Ivor Waters, The Town of Chepstow, 1972, p. 194 The name \\"St Kingsmark\\" derived from that of a medieval priory which existed close to the school, on what is now Kingsmark Lane.

The school was linked to the OCR innovative science model since the introduction of the pilot scheme over 5 years ago. Since the introduction of the broadened curriculum, results have improved from 55% to 65% for the science core and 72% for Additional Science. Inspection An Estyn inspection of the school in January 2012 reported both the school's performance, and its prospects for improvement, as \\"adequate\\". It reported that good features of the school's work include recent improvements in performance in key stage 4; many pupils making suitable progress in developing their knowledge, understanding and skills in lessons; pupils’ wellbeing, including behaviour, attendance, and the development of social and life skills; effective teaching in the majority of lessons; an inclusive ethos and a high level of care, support and guidance; and a wide range of extra- curricular activities, especially in sport and music. However, it also considered that performance at key stage 3 is weak; performance in English and mathematics at key stage 4 is below expectations; pupils’ literacy and numeracy skills are underdeveloped; and a few pupils, mainly the more able, do not make as much progress as they should. The school’s prospects for improvement were judged as adequate because leadership has been effective in making recent improvements in performance at key stage 4; there is a clear and accurate understanding of the school’s strengths and of the specific areas that need to be improved; appropriate self-evaluation procedures are in place and these link well to the improvement planning process; and governors provide a high standard of challenge and support. However, many of the processes were considered to be too new to have their planned impact; the co-ordination of skills provision is at an early stage; and the quality of middle managers varies too much.

Hanbury Brown, Harry C. Minnett and Frederick W.G. White, Edward George Bowen 1911–1991, Historical Records of Australian Science, vol.9, no.2, 1992. ; republished in Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society of London, 1992. was a Welsh physicist who made a major contribution to the development of radar, and so helped win both the Battle of Britain and the Battle of the Atlantic. He was also an early radio astronomer, playing a key role in the establishment of radioastronomy in Australia and the United States. Early years Edward George Bowen was born at Cockett in Swansea, south Wales, to George Bowen and Ellen Ann (née Owen). George Bowen was a steelworker in a Swansea tinplate works. Edward Bowen was highly intelligent, and so was able to get a good education by winning scholarships. From an early age he developed a strong interest in radio and cricket. He entered Swansea University and read physics and related subjects. He graduated with a First- Class Honours degree in 1930, and continued with postgraduate research on X-rays and the structure of alloys, earning an MSc in 1931. He completed his doctorate under Professor E.V. Appleton at King's College London. As part of his research, Bowen spent a large part of 1933 and 1934 working with a cathode-ray direction finder at the Radio Research Station at Slough, and it was there that he was noticed by Robert Watson-Watt and so came to play a part in the early history of radar. In 1935 he was recruited by Watson-Watt to work in the Radar Development Team as a Junior Scientific Officer. Ground-based radar A Committee for the Scientific Study of Air Defence had been established under the chairmanship of Henry Tizard. Before the first meeting of that committee in early 1935, the Government asked Watson-Watt whether an intense beam of radio waves, a \\"death ray\\", could bring down an aircraft. Watson-Watt reported that a \\"death ray\\" was impracticable, but suggested that radio waves might be used to detect, rather than destroy, enemy aircraft. After a successful demonstration in February 1935 of the reflection of radio waves by an aircraft, the development of radar went ahead, and a team of five people including Bowen was set up at Orfordness under the cover of doing ionospheric research. Bowen's job was to assemble a transmitter, managing quickly to raise the pulse-power to over 100 kilowatts. The first detection of an aircraft was made on 17 June 1935 at a range of 17 miles. By early 1936 after many improvements, aircraft were being detected at ranges of up to 100 miles. This caused work to be started on a chain of radar stations (Chain Home or CH), initially just covering the approaches to London. The team at Orfordness was enlarged as a result, and in March 1936 a new headquarters was acquired at Bawdsey Manor. Bowen, at his own request, was moved on to investigating whether radar could be installed in an aircraft. However, Bowen was able to save the day when a demonstration of the new transmitter at Bawdsey Manor failed. Before a disgruntled Sir Hugh Dowding returned to London, Bowen gave him an impromptu demonstration of an experimental radar, built as part of his airborne radar programme, which was detecting the aircraft at ranges of up to 50 miles. After working through the night, Bowen resurrected the old transmitter at Orford Ness for the following day's demonstration, allowing the Government and RAF to continue with the extension of the chain of coastal stations. Airborne radar Installing radar in an aircraft was difficult because of the size and weight of the equipment and the aerial. Furthermore, the equipment had to operate in a vibrating and cold environment. Over the next few years Bowen and his group solved most of these problems. For example, he solved the problem of the power supply in aircraft by using an engine-driven alternator, and he encouraged Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) to produce the first radio-frequency cables with solid polythene insulation. Further refinements continued until September 1937, when Bowen gave a dramatic and uninvited demonstration of the application of radar by searching for the British Fleet in the North Sea in poor visibility, detecting three capital ships. Bowen's airborne radar group now had two major projects, one for the detection of ships and the other for interception of aircraft. Bowen also experimented briefly with the use of airborne radar to detect features on the ground, such as towns and coastlines, to aid navigation. Second World War On the outbreak of the Second World War, Bowen's unit was moved to St Athan. One of the first things that Bowen did there was to try to detect a submarine by radar. By then, the cavity magnetron had been improved by John Randall and Harry Boot, making airborne radar a powerful tool. By December 1940, operational aircraft were able to detect submarines at up to 15 miles range. This technology had a major effect on winning the Battle of the Atlantic and eventually enabled forces to be built up by sea for the invasion of Europe. In April 1941, RAF Coastal Command was operating anti-submarine patrols with about 110 aircraft fitted with radar. This increased the detection of submarines both day and night. However, very few of the attacks were lethal until the introduction in mid-1942 of a powerful searchlight, the Leigh light, that illuminated the submarine. As a result, the U-boats had to recharge their batteries in daylight so that they could at least see the aircraft coming. The radar and the Leigh light together cut Allied shipping losses dramatically. Developments also continued in air interception, and a radar with a narrow rotating beam and plan-position- indicator (PPI) was developed and used by the RAF to direct fighters in October 1940. Early versions of airborne radar were fitted to Blenheims, but had limited minimum and maximum range. However, in the hands of skilled crews, later versions in 1941 were remarkably effective, and in the heavy night raids of 1941 radar-equipped fighters were the main weapon of air defence. In May 1941, over 100 enemy aircraft were shot down at night using radar, compared with 30 by anti-aircraft guns. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S greatly improved the accuracy of Allied bombers in the strategic bombing campaign. Centimetric gun-laying radars were much more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly, and with the newly developed proximity fuse, made anti-aircraft guns more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the German V-1 flying-bomb flight paths to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target. Tizard Mission Bowen went to the United States with the Tizard Mission in 1940 and helped to initiate tremendous advances in microwave radar as a weapon. Bowen visited US laboratories and told them about airborne radar and arranged demonstrations. He was able to take an early example of the cavity magnetron. With remarkable speed the US military set up a special laboratory, the MIT Radiation Laboratory for the development of centimetre-wave radar, and Bowen collaborated closely with them on their programme, writing the first draft specification for their first system. The first American experimental airborne 10 cm radar was tested, with Bowen on board, in March 1941, only seven months after the Tizard Mission had arrived. The Tizard Mission was highly successful almost entirely because of the information provided by Bowen. It helped to establish the alliance between the United States and Britain over a year before the Americans entered the war. The success of collaboration in radar helped to set up channels of communication that would help in other transfers of technology to the United States such as jet engines and nuclear physics. Australia In the closing months of 1943, Bowen seemed to be at \\"loose ends\\" because his work in the US was virtually finished and the invasion of Europe by the Allies was imminent. Bowen was invited to come to Australia to join the CSIRO Radiophysics Laboratory, and in May 1946, he was appointed Chief of the Division of Radiophysics. Bowen addressed many audiences on the development of radar, its military uses and its potential peacetime applications to civil aviation, marine navigation and surveying. In addition to developments in radar, Bowen also undertook two other research activities: the pulse method of acceleration of elementary particles; and air navigation resulted in the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) that was ultimately adopted by many civil aircraft. He also encouraged the new science of radioastronomy and brought about the construction of the 210 ft radio telescope at Parkes, New South Wales. During visits to the US, he met two of his influential contacts during the war, Dr. Vannevar Bush who had become the President of the Carnegie Corporation and Dr. Alfred Loomis who was also a Trustee of the Carnegie Corporation and of the Rockefeller Foundation. He persuaded them in 1954 to fund a large radio telescope in Australia with a grant of $250,000. Bowen in return helped to establish American radio astronomy by seconding Australians to the California Institute of Technology. Bowen played a key role in the design of the radio telescope at Parkes. At its inauguration in October 1961, he remarked, \\"...the search for truth is one of the noblest aims of mankind and there is nothing which adds to the glory of the human race or lends it such dignity as the urge to bring the vast complexity of the Universe within the range of human understanding.\\" The Parkes Telescope proved timely for the US space program and tracked many space probes, including the Apollo missions. Later, Bowen played an important role in guiding the optical Anglo- Australian Telescope project during its design phase. This was opened in 1974. Bowen also instigated rain-making experiments in Australia in 1947, and continued after he retired in 1971. He was also interested in the phenomenon of Climatic Singularities, suggesting that they might be related to the Earth's passage through belts of meteor dust – whose particles then acted as ice-nuclei for seeding clouds. Honours Bowen was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1941, then promoted to commander in 1962. He was also awarded the American Medal of Freedom in 1947. He became a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1957 and of the Royal Society in 1975. Personal life At Swansea University Bowen had met his future wife, Enid Vesta Williams, who was from nearby Neath. They married in 1938, and had three sons: Edward, David and John. Bowen had an enduring love of cricket, and played regularly. He also became a keen sailor. In December 1987, he suffered a stroke and gradually deteriorated. He died on 12 August 1991 at the age of 80.

The pupillary dilator consists of a spokelike arrangement of modified contractile cells called myoepithelial cells. These cells are stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system. When stimulated, the cells contract, widening the pupil and allowing more light to enter the eye. Structure =Innervation= It is innervated by the sympathetic system, which acts by releasing noradrenaline, which acts on α1-receptors. page 163 Thus, when presented with a threatening stimuli that activates the fight-or-flight response, this innervation contracts the muscle and dilates the pupil, thus temporarily letting more light reach the retina. The dilator muscle is innervated more specifically by postganglionic sympathetic nerves arising from the superior cervical ganglion as the sympathetic root of ciliary ganglion. From there, they travel via the internal carotid artery through the carotid canal to foramen lacerum. They then enter the middle cranial fossa above foramen lacerum, travel through the cavernous sinus in the middle cranial fossa and then travel with the ophthalmic artery in the optic canal or on the ophthalmic nerve through the superior orbital fissure. From there, they travel with the nasociliary nerve and then the long ciliary nerve. They then pierce the sclera, travel between sclera and choroid to reach the iris dilator muscle. They will also pass through ciliary ganglion and travel in short ciliary nerves to reach the iris dilator muscle. Function The pupillary dilator acts to increase the size of the pupil to allow more light to enter the eye. It works in opposition to the pupillary constrictor.

The first explanation considers dilatare as frequentative of differere. The Latin verb differe can mean, to carry different ways, to spread abroad, to scatter, but also to delay. The other explanation considers dilatare as a compound from di- and latus, with the latter word meaning, broad or wide, hence the German name Erweiterer for Latin dilatator. The expression dilator pupillae muscle, as used in the list of English equivalents of the Terminologia Anatomica, is actually partly Latin, i.e. dilator pupillae, with pupillae (=of the pupil), a noun in the genitive case modifying dilator, a noun in the nominative case, and partly English, i.e. muscle.

It is designed to improve history, logic, and problem solving skills in children ages 7 to 10 (or 10 and up, according to the box art seen to the right). Challenge of the Ancient Empires! is an adventure game whose objective is to obtain the artifacts hidden in each of the four regions. To do this, the player must navigate through cavern chambers, dodging enemies and obstacles, recovering pieces of artifacts and putting them together in a tiling puzzle in order to advance to the next level. Gameplay The objective of Challenge of the Ancient Empires! is to collect the hidden treasures from caverns in 4 different regions of the world: Greece and Rome, Egypt, India and China, and the Near East. Each of these caverns consists of four chambers. The decorations and artifacts in each of these chambers correlates to the region being explored. For example, the Egyptian cavern features decorations of hieroglyphs and mummies and will contain artifacts like the sphinx or the Rosetta Stone.Screenshot from Challenge of the Ancient Empires!. Additionally, each cavern has a different style of puzzle; The Near East section implements switches that move panels blocking the way, while the Egyptian section consists mainly of triangular reflectors, which the player must orient correctly to direct a light beam and trigger a switch. Greece and Rome caverns imply Greek letter coded gates that open by entering the right combination. India and China involves the manipulation of conveyor belts to advance in the proper direction. Upon successfully navigating a chamber's puzzle and collecting six pieces of the artifact, the player must then solve a puzzle by orienting and placing rectangular puzzle pieces in the proper configuration to reveal a picture of the artifact. Afterwards, he must find the exit door and solve a logic puzzle to advance to the next chamber. The four main caverns, associated with the four regions of the world, may be played in any order. Once the player completes all four chambers in each of the four caverns, a new cavern opens. This cavern is referred to as the \\"Ancient World\\" and is composed of four new chambers. Each chamber is in the style of one of the four regions from the previous caverns. The Ancient World cavern is more difficult than the others and consists of a combination of all the puzzles in the main caverns. The player has three items to help him navigate through each cavern's puzzles. These items include a miner's hat, a pair of special shoes, called \\"turbo tennies,\\" that allow the player to jump higher, and four force fields that will protect the player from all damage for a few seconds. The miner's hat shines a beam of light used to flip switches or temporarily stun any cave animals that can cause the player damage. The Egyptian cavern has several challenges that involve rotating prisms and mirrors to deflect the light beam to a specific sensor. The shoes allow the player to jump much higher than a normal. A force field will prevent all damage for five seconds when used, but the player is only given four of them per level. A display at the bottom of the screen show the player's current collected artifact pieces, chosen tool, current cavern and chamber, and remaining energy. The energy bar functions as a life bar and has four segments. If the player comes into contact with a cave animal or a projectile, one segment is depleted. If all four segments are lost, the player must begin the chamber over again. Health can be restored either by picking up apples in the caverns or by correctly solving a logic puzzle on the first attempt. The game provides two distinct difficulty levels: Explorer and Expert. The chambers of the four main caverns are similar in puzzle style, but differ in layout, number, speed of the enemies, and availability of health power-ups. Additionally, on Expert difficulty, the logic puzzles are more challenging and include an entirely different set of artifacts. The puzzles on this difficulty contain pieces that require being flipped, in order to be oriented correctly. Development =Super Solvers series= Originally a stand-alone game titled Ancient Empires!, the game was rereleased as a part of the Super Solvers series; a series of computer games released by The Learning Company that contain both educational and entertainment qualities.

The village is split into Upper Brynamman and Lower Brynamman by the River Amman, which is also the boundary between the counties of Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot (in the old county of Glamorganshire). Ruins of stone dwellings (possibly prehistoric), an early type of lime kiln and rectangular medieval buildings found on the mountain show that people have lived in this area for a long time. The population of Brynamman was 2,608 as of 2011; the urban area including Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen was 5,692. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000400 https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W38000134 In the 18th century the Industrial Revolution, with iron and tin works and especially coal mining, transformed the area from a small, scattered farming community to a built-up, highly populated commercial centre. The Welsh language was at the fore and the successful participation in local and national eisteddfodau by numerous village people, choirs and bands put Brynamman on the map. It was once a thriving village, with three bank branches on Station Road in Upper Brynamman alone. Today there are no industries in or around the village, its inhabitants having to commute to Ammanford, Swansea or Llanelli for work. The whole area has become more attractive to live in, with the countryside and the wild open areas available for walking on the Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du). It is still a stronghold of the Welsh language; children are taught the language at school, and it is spoken by the great majority of the local people. Brynamman was previously known as Y Gwter Fawr (); the name was changed when the railway from Ammanford reached the village. George Borrow describes aspects of Gwter Fawr in the mid-19th century in his book Wild Wales published 1862. The current name is derived from \\"Brynamman House\\", the home of John Jones, builder of the railway. Brynamman Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared in the mid-1920s. It continued into the 1930s.\\"Brynamman Golf Club\\", \\"Golf’s Missing Links\\". Ynys Dawela Ynys Dawela Nature Park in the snow (January 2010) Ynys Dawela Nature Park is situated to the west of Brynamman, in the upper reaches of the Amman Valley. Its northern boundary is the Brecon Beacons National Park, and the river Amman, fringed with ancient oak woodland, forms its southern boundary. The park covers an area of 39 acres (15.8 hectares) and was once a working farm. The meadows dating from this period now support some scarce flowers, such as the Whorled Caraway and Meadow Thistle, and other wildlife, such as the marsh fritillary butterfly and dormice. The park has a range of important habitats supporting a diverse assemblage of plant and animal life. The wet grasslands, marshy ground and ponds are particularly important to amphibians, like newts, frogs and toads. The site narrowly escaped opencast mining, before Dinefwr Borough Council secured its future by purchasing it from British Coal. Since then the park has been developed for recreational and educational use. The park is managed by Carmarthenshire County Council and supported by volunteers.

It is the methyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid.  Natural occurrences  Methylparaben serves as a pheromone for a variety of insects and is a component of queen mandibular pheromone. It is a pheromone in wolves produced during estrus associated with the behavior of alpha male wolves preventing other males from mounting females in heat.  Uses  Methylparaben is an anti-fungal agent often used in a variety of cosmetics and personal-care products. It is also used as a food preservative and has the E number E218. Methylparaben is commonly used as a fungicide in Drosophila food media at 0.1% https://bdsc.indiana.edu/information/recipes/germanfood.html. To Drosophila, methylparaben is toxic at higher concentrations, has an estrogenic effect (mimicking estrogen in rats and having anti-androgenic activity), and slows the growth rate in the larval and pupal stages at 0.2%.  Safety  There is controversy about whether methylparaben or propylparabens are harmful at concentrations typically used in body care or cosmetics. Methylparaben and propylparaben are considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the USFDA for food and cosmetic antibacterial preservation. Methylparaben is readily metabolized by common soil bacteria, making it completely biodegradable. Methylparaben is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or through the skin. It is hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and rapidly excreted in urine without accumulating in the body. Acute toxicity studies have shown that methylparaben is practically non-toxic by both oral and parenteral administration in animals. In a population with normal skin, methylparaben is practically non-irritating and non-sensitizing; however, allergic reactions to ingested parabens have been reported. A 2008 study found no competitive binding for human estrogen and androgen receptors for methylparaben, but varying levels of competitive binding were seen with butyl- and isobutyl- paraben. Studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB, leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage.

Altamira is a neighborhood located in the Chacao municipality of Caracas, Venezuela. It has its own Metro Station, many hotels and restaurants, and it is an important business and residential center of the city. It is also an important tourist destination and cultural center in Caracas. The Francisco de Miranda avenue (a major avenue in Caracas) and the Distibuidor Altamira (a congested highway exit) are both located in Altamira. This neighborhood borders El Ávila National Park to the north, La Castellana neighborhood to the west, Los Palos Grandes to the east, and Bello Campo neighborhood to the south. It has an estimated area of 161 hectares or approximately 1.61 square kilometers. History Plaza Francia Altamira was created on June 30, 1577, by Juan Andres Varela. This neighborhood is currently home to Plaza Francia (though it is commonly called Plaza Altamira), a well-known landmark which includes an obelisk and a fountain. This square and most of Altamira was built by Luis Roche, who owned most of the area in 1943. In 1944, Luis Roche ordered -with permission of the government- the construction of many avenues and the square. Roche wanted the square's obelisk to be \\"higher than the Cathedral of Caracas\\". The square was completed by Martin Hermanos co on August 11, 1945, and was originally called Plaza Altamira. On January 17, 1967, the Venezuelan and French governments agreed to rename Plaza Altamira to Plaza Francia (France Square in Spanish). The French government built a Plaza Venezuela in their country in 1975. In 1948, Luis Roche began exploring the possibility of building a tunnel between Altamira and the Caribbean Sea. He contacted the people who were in charge of the construction of the Hudson River Tunnels, in New York City. This project was scrapped due to its high cost as it required three tunnels, two of them used exclusively for ventilation. If built, the tunnel would have been about eight kilometers long. Luis Roche was later assigned Venezuelan Ambassador to Argentina. Today, Altamira has its own Metro Station, many hotels and restaurants, and is an important business center in Caracas. Avenida Francisco de Miranda (a major avenue in Caracas) and the Distribuidor Altamira (a congested highway exit) are both located in Altamira. Altamira was the scene of a mass shooting on December 6, 2002. João de Gouveia murdered three citizens and injured 19 participating in a demonstration in Plaza Altamira against Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. The shooting occurred during the 2002-2003 general strike. On August 16, 2004, Plaza Francia was the scene of another incident.

It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents. It has proven to be a highly successful antimicrobial preservative in cosmetics. It is also used in medication suspensions, and as a flavoring additive in food.  Natural occurrence  Members of the paraben family are found in fruit and vegetable products, such as barley, flax seed, and grapes. Butylparaben has also been found to be produced in some microorganisms including Microbulbifer .  Preparation  Butylparaben is prepared by the esterification of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid with 1-butanol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid. It is produced industrially  Uses and reactions  Butylparaben is one of the most common bactericidal/fungicidal additives in cosmetics. It has been used in cosmetic products since the 1940s and in pharmaceutical products since 1924. The popularity of butylparaben in these products is due to its low toxicity in humans and its effective antimicrobial properties, in particular those against mold and yeast. It is now found in more than 20,000 cosmetic products including eye shadow, facial moisturizer/treatment, anti-aging cream, foundation, and sunscreen. It is also used as low-ionic strength solutions as a preservative in some foods and drugs. In most cosmetics paraben is used at low levels, ranging from 0.01 to 0.3%. Butylparaben is used in low concentrations in liquid and solid medication suspensions, such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen. =Mechanism of action= The exact mechanism of how parabens work is unknown but they are proposed to act by inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis, and enzymes like ATPase and phosphotransferase in some bacterial species. It has also been suggested that they interfere with membrane transport processes by disrupting the lipid bylayer and possibly causing the leakage of intracellular constituents. Regulation and controversy Butylparaben has not escaped controversy, which itself is controversial. In December 2010 the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Union reported that insufficient data is available to perform risk assessments for butylparaben in humans. The committee has also stated that it considers the use of butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products as safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%. =Regulation= Denmark restricts butylparaben in products for use by children younger than the age of three. In 2003, butylparaben was approved for use as a flavor additive in food by the U.S. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Butylparaben is also regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Its pesticide registration was canceled in 1998. in 2020 European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) added Butylparaben to very high concern (SVHC) in the Candidate List for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV REACH in category \\"Toxic for reproduction\\". =Endocrine disruption= Long-chained parabens, like butylparaben, are more estrogenic than short-chained parabens, like methyl- or ethylparaben. This difference is attributed to the greater lipophilicity of the former. Butylparaben displayed the most competitive binding to rat estrogen receptors when tested along with methyl, ethyl, and propylparabens. =Antiandrogenic= Butylparaben can decrease sperm function and alter metabolic hormones. Rats exposed to a high concentration of butylparaben during pregnancy gave birth to fewer pups, and pups with malformed reproductive organs. Mice administered butylparaben at 0.01-1% body weight for ten weeks showed a decrease in serum testosterone concentration and in spermatid counts in the seminiferous tubules. =Other= It has been shown that butylparaben enter the body through the lungs, GI tract, and skin epithelium. It occurs in breast cancers at around tissue. However, parabens have not been proven to cause breast cancer. Estimates by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition have found that the average person is exposed to about 37 ng of butylparaben per day. Butylparaben has been found in small concentrations in human breast fat and breast tumors. A review by the National Toxicology Program concluded, \\"There is no evidence of demonstrable risk for the development of breast cancer caused by the use of paraben-containing underarm cosmetics.\\" Animal studies have been inconclusive. Oral administration of butylparaben to eight-week-old rats has caused tumors such as thymic lymphoma, non-thymic lymphoid leukemia, and myeloid leukemia. Similar studies, however, have found no significant increase in tumors upon butylparaben administration. Butylparaben is not listed as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Environmental fate Butylparaben has been found in the sewage. A 2001 study found that concentrations of parabens in Danish sewage facilities was to 100 to 1000 times below the acute or chronic effect concentrations.

He is known for popularizing the playing of the banjo and has often been credited with advancing the physical development of the modern five-string banjo. Biography Born to a farming family in the county of Appomattox, Virginia he claimed to have learned to play the banjo from local enslaved Africans. He is the earliest known person to have played the banjo on stage.Cockrell 148. Aside from his important role in popularizing the instrument, he has often been credited with advancing the physical development of the modern five- string banjo. Whereas the instrument's resonating chamber had formerly been constructed from a gourd (like the banjo's African ancestors and cousins), Sweeney popularized the use of a drum-like resonating chamber (legend has it that he adapted a cheese box for this purpose).Rice 22.. He has also been credited with adding the banjo's fifth string, which according to legend was for an instrument he created for his niece between 1831 and 1840. He supposedly added the fifth string because he was \\"allegedly unhappy with the limited rhythm and melodic variation of the four-string banjos popularly in use.\\" Bailey, J: \\"Historical Origin and Stylistic Developments of the Five- String Banjo\\", p. 59, The Journal of American Folklore, 1972. In fact, there is no proof that Sweeney introduced either innovation. \\"Outlandish claims have been made about Sweeney, from his being the \\"inventor\\" of the banjo to his being the first white man to play the banjo. These claims are part of an effort, beginning in the nineteenth century, to divorce the banjo from its African American origins.\\" Many people assume Sweeney's \\"fifth string\\" is the drone string—the chanterelle—but if Sweeney did really add a fifth string, it would have been another, lower string. That would provide more melodic and harmonic expression, as the quote suggests. The high-pitched, thumb or drone string (the chanterelle, the fifth on a modern banjo) is seen on surviving 18th-century four-string banjos, and in banjo illustrations that long pre-date Sweeney's heyday.Carlin. The fifth string gives the banjo a reentrant tuning, a feature that existed in instruments of the ancient Greeks.Bailey, J Sweeney began performing with the banjo in the early 1830s. He first performed throughout central Virginia for county court sessions. A few years later he joined a circus and traveled throughout Virginia and North Carolina. By 1839, Sweeney was performing in various blackface venues in New York. His earliest documented use of the banjo on stage was in April 1839. That same month, he performed alongside James Sanford at the Broadway Circus in New York with a blackface burlesque of The Dying Moor's Defence of His Flag called \\"Novel Duetts, Songs, &c;\\". This was accompanied by a \\"Comic Morris Dance by the whole company\\".23–26 December 1839. New York Herald. Quoted in Cockrell 52. According to Billy Whitlock of the Virginia Minstrels, Sweeney gave Whitlock a few banjo lessons around this time. Sweeney's Virginia Melodies, 1847 In colonial America the banjo was known as an instrument of \\"the lower classes,\\" but by 1841, Sweeney was remaking the banjo into an instrument for the middle class. His advertisements boasted that he played with \\"scientific touches of perfection\\".18 March 1841. Playbill, Bowery Theatre. Quoted in Cockrell 148. Another raved, \\"Only those who have heard Sweeny know what music there is in a banjo.\\"9 December 1841. Boston Post. Quoted in Cockrell 148. For the next few years, he was the benchmark against whom other banjo players were compared. After a performance by Dan Emmett at the Bowery Amphitheatre Circus, the New York Herald wrote, \\"Emmit's banjo playing is fully equal to Jo Sweeney's, and far ahead of any other now in the United States.\\"31 January 1842. New York Herald. Quoted in Cockrell 149. \\"Jenny Get Your Hoe Cake Done\\" and \\"Knock a Nigger Down\\" became two of Sweeney's signature tunes. Sweeney saw success, and by early 1843, he embarked on a European tour that included stops in London and Edinburgh. In July 1843, Sweeney played during entr'actes at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland. Frank Brower of the Virginia Minstrels met him there and joined Sweeney's act as a bones player. The two toured, performing in early October at the Theatre Royal in Birmingham and later that month in a circus at Leicester. At some point, Brower parted company to tour with Dan Emmett, though he rejoined Sweeney by spring of 1844. At this time, Dick Pelham met up with Sweeney and Brower, and the trio decided to reform the Virginia Minstrels with Sweeney as banjoist. They found Emmett in Bolton and talked him into joining, although Sweeney would be the troupe leader. The new Virginia Minstrels performed in Dublin at the Theatre Royal from 24 April to 7 May during entr'actes, then continued for a series of entr'actes and complete minstrel shows in Cork, Belfast, then Glasgow by the end of May. They did several shows at the Theatre Royal, Adelphi, and later in the Waterloo Rooms in Edinburgh, followed by a return engagement in Glasgow, this time at City Hall. Joel Sweeney's younger brothers, Sampson (\\"Sam\\") and Richard (\\"Dick\\"), and his sister Missouri were also talented banjo and fiddle players.

A or maou is a ruler of mazoku, or in fiction more generically a dark lord or powerful monster.  Etymology  The name ma (魔 - devil) suggests that they are meant to threaten human existence or defy the gods, while -zoku (族 - tribe, clan, family) indicates that they are a family. Maō (魔王) is a term derived from mazoku, suggesting a king (王 Ō - king, ruler) that rules the mazoku.  In mythology and legend  The term \\"mazoku\\" was used to describe the asura and yaksha in Hindu mythology, as well as Zoroastrianism's daeva. It is a general term for devils, demons and evil beings. In Japanese polytheism, it is an antonym of 神族 (shinzoku), \\"the tribe of gods\\". A maō is a king or ruler over mazoku. For instance, in Bible translations, Satan is a maō. In polytheism, the counterpart of maō is 神王 (shin'ō), \\"the king of gods\\". The Japanese feudal lord Oda Nobunaga also called himself a maō in a letter to Takeda Shingen, signing it with 第六天魔王 (\\"the demon king of the sixth sky\\").  In fiction  In Japanese fantasy, the meaning of \\"mazoku\\" differs from work to work. Some works use the term for all evil beings that are enemies of humans or good beings, while others use it to specify a certain group of beings (not necessarily evil). The term 悪魔族 (akumazoku) may be used to designate evil mazoku specifically (the word 悪, aku, means \\"evil\\"). A maō may be a king of the mazoku, or more generally a king of demons, overlord, dark lord, archenemy of the hero or video game boss. The term is not gender-specific. For instance, Der Erlkönig, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, widely translated as \\"Elf King\\" in English, was translated as \\"maō\\" in Japanese. The term daimaō (大魔王 - great demon king) is sometimes used to describe a very high-ranking or powerful maō. An example is Piccolo Daimaō, a villain from the Dragon Ball manga.

It is now the central motif of the flag of Montenegro, as well as the coat of arms of the Army of Montenegro. It was constitutionally sanctioned by the Constitution proclaimed on 2 October 2007.  Description  The charge is a two-headed eagle, a symbol of Byzantine and ultimately ancient Roman origin. It symbolizes either the unity of or the close connections between the church and the state. The motif was used by medieval rulers of Zeta—the House of Crnojević—as well as various other European dynasties. The layout of the Montenegrin coat of arms is inspired by that of the Russian Empire, with which the ruling House of Petrović-Njegoš had close dynastic and political ties in the 19th century when the coat of arms was first adopted in its present form. The lion passant on the inescutcheon is as a sign of episcopal authority and could have been conceived of as a metaphor for the Lion of Judah. Furthermore, it bears some similarity to the motif present in the arms of Venice, which had considerable influence in the history of Montenegro. After Montenegro regained its independence from Ottoman Empire, it gradually became a theocracy to have a united front against the numerous Turkish invasions of the country. For this reason, the authority of the church was reflected in various insignia of the age. After the establishment of the secular dynastic succession in 1851, the lion was placed beneath the eagle, while the initials of the ruler stood on the shield: notably, that of Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro, Danilo II, Prince of Montenegro and King Nicholas I of Montenegro. Curiously, Danilo I was still a prince-bishop while the standard bearing his initials was used. The modern coat of arms placed the lion d’or back on the shield, erasing that monarchic symbol. Today, Montenegro is a secular, democratic republic, so the fact that the crown of the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty was also represented created some controversy at the time of its adoption. However, this configuration proved extremely popular. The coat of arms can be seen not only in public places such as schools and governmental offices, but also in many private houses, places of business and private universities, due to being a common display of national pride. The National Symbols and Statehood Day of Montenegro Law contains the official blazon of the current arms: Despite the mention of the red background, the coat of arms is almost always used without it, with the eagle appearing as a supporter. The coat of arms appears on a red background on the national seal and the national flag. Use of national symbols under Montenegrin law The coat of arms and the flag are used in the shape and contents determined by law. The use of the coat of arms and the flag is free in artistic creativity and educational work, in manners not disturbing the public morale, reputation and dignity of Montenegro. In the coat of arms and the flag, it is not permitted to correct, add or change anything. Exceptionally, if so determined by special regulations, the coat of arms and the flag could be used as a component of other emblems or signs of the state bodies and other institutions. The coat of arms and the flag can not be used as merchant or service seal, sample or model, nor as any other sign marking the merchandise and services. The coat of arms and the flag cannot be used if they are defective or otherwise inappropriate for use due to the unsuitable appearance. A defective or unsuitable for use coat of arms or flag are revoked from use. When displayed in Montenegro together with one or more coats of arms of other states or international organizations, the coat of arms takes the place of honour. The place of honour is considered the central place in a circle, the top of the semicircle, the first place in a row, column or group of coats of arms, the place on the right, as seen from the front, from the coat of arms of another state or international organization. On scripts it takes place on the top center or upper left angle.Government of Montenegro, National Symbols Act = The coat of arms is used = # In the state seal; # In the seals of other state bodies and local self-management bodies; # In the official halls of the state bodies and the local self-management bodies and on official inscriptions on the buildings in which these are located; # In rooms of educational institutions in which the educational process is performed and on inscriptions on buildings in which these institutions are located # On buildings of the representations of Montenegro abroad; # On official acts used by the representatives of the state bodies; # On charters, diplomas and recognitions granted by Montenegro; # On diplomas and attestations on finished education; # On identity cards of members of the parliament, members of the government, judges, inspectors and other officials. = The coat of arms may be used = # During political, scientific, cultural, artistic, sporting and other manifestations in which Montenegro is represented; # On official acknowledgments, greeting cards, invitations and other acts of the President of Montenegro, the Chairman of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Chairman of the High Court, the Chairman of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme State Attorney and the Human Rights Ombudsman; # On official uniforms; # In artistic creations and in educational work; # In other cases defined by the law. Historical coats of arms The history of the state coat of arms begins with the Crnojević dynasty in the 15th century. Their family arms – a golden crowned two-headed eagle on a red background – laid the foundation of the Montenegrin state heraldry: the two-headed eagle became the standard symbol of the state. After gaining power, the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty took the golden two-headed eagle as the state symbol. Vladika Danilo charged on its breast the Great Arms of the Petrović-Njegoš family (shield, crown, mantling), while his successor vladika Sava made major changes to the coat of arms: he removed the family Great Arms from the eagle's breast, and added a sceptre and a globus cruciger (\\"the imperial orb\\") in its claws. He also added another symbol retained until present day – a golden lion passant – below the golden eagle. With Petar I, further rearrangement of the coat of arms took place: he removed the royal insignia from the eagle and charged the eagle's breast with the Middle Arms of the Petrović-Njegoš while leaving the lion passant. Prince Danilo also reorganised the coat of arms: he charged the golden eagle's breast with a shield with a blue background and a golden lion passant on green ground. In one claw the eagle held the orb, and in the other a sword and a sceptre. In the time of King Nicholas I, the sword was removed and later, in conformity with the Constitution of 1905, the colour of the eagle was changed from golden to silver as well as the colour of the inescutcheon – from blue to red.Historical symbols of Montenegro After World War II, Montenegrin statehood was reestablished and Montenegro became a federal part of the Second Yugoslavia. A national emblem was adopted in 1945 and it was designed in socialist style: Laurel wreath with Red Star, while the central motive was the Chapel of Lovćen with sea waves in the background, representing the Montenegrin sea access. The national emblem of the Federal State of Montenegro was made in 1944 by Milan Božović, it was stylised in 1946 by Milo Milunović, and afterwards slightly changed in 1963 and 1974 (the shape of the red star). In 1993, the Montenegrin parliament introduced a coat of arms proper, returning to historical heritage. The old Montenegrin state's coat of arms was restored, but redesigned in the style of the federal coat of arms which were official adopted on 6 January 1994.

Cherry used shadowing tasks to study this problem, which involve playing two different auditory messages to a participant's left and right ears and instructing them to attend to only one. The participant must then shadow this attended message. Cherry found that very little information about the unattended message was obtained by his participants: physical characteristics were detected but semantic characteristics were not. Cherry therefore concluded that unattended auditory information receives very little processing and that we use physical differences between messages to select which one we tend. He was born in St. Albans in 1914 and educated at St Albans School and Northampton Polytechnic (now City University) gaining his B.Sc. in 1936. After the war, during which he worked on radar research with the British Ministry of Aircraft Production, he taught at the Manchester College of Technology and then Imperial College London.

It is located in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, approximately 20 km from the city centre. Aberfoyle Park has a shopping mall called \\"The Hub\\", several primary schools and a public high school, one of the biggest in the state. Aberfoyle Park is served by the Adelaide Metro bus routes G20, G21 and G22, which connect the suburb to Adelaide's city centre. History Windebanks Road In 1845, Christian Sauerbier, from Germany, purchased land south of Adelaide, near Happy Valley. In 1856, Sauerbier owned eleven sections of land in the area. The area became agricultural and the Sauerbier family was renowned for the quality of their stud stock and the orange grove that was attached to their property. Christian Sauerbier died in 1893 and the property was given to his son, John Chris. During the First World War, when anti-German sentiment was at a high in Australia, Chris changed his last name to Aberfoyle - a potential reference to the Scottish village of Aberfoyle where his father had previously lived. John Chris died in 1923 and his estate was subdivided and sold by James Henry Browne. Agriculture was the core of the districts economy for quite some time. Inevitably, the farmlands were turned into suburban expansion and the suburb of Aberfoyle Park was proclaimed on 10 July 1980. The Aberfoyle Park Post Office opened on 16 November 1981. Geography The suburb is located in the Adelaide Hills, giving the area a hilly terrain. Parks located in the suburb include Thalassa Park. Governance Aberfoyle Park is part of the City of Onkaparinga.

He was one of the founders of the Moderna movement in Serbian poetry. Young Pandurović was educated at Belgrade's Grande École (Velika škola), and after a brief experience at teaching determined to devote himself to literature, writing poetry and criticism for literary magazines, particularly Misao, which he founded shortly after the war. At the beginning of the 20th century, he joined \\"the poets of pessimism\\" – Milan Rakić and Vladislav Petković Dis – then under the influences of Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe. Biography Sima Pandurović was born in the heart of Belgrade in the centre of a lively downtown in 1883. He studied philosophy at Belgrade's Grande école (Velika škola) and knew early on that he wanted to be a poet. Pandurović wrote often for \\"Bosanska vila\\" (The Bosnian Muse) in the capacity of an informed and elequent literary critic and theoretician. In addition to his thorough knowledge of the literary and cultural situation, Pandurović was Vladislav Petković Dis's principal literary associate and drinking companion in pre- Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I. The duo were the enfants terrible of their literary world. They were frequent evening visitors to the Belgrade's kafanas (nightclubs) in the Bohemian quarter of the city called Skadarlija and elsewhere they would drink with friends and compose new verse at the same time. Both Pandurović and Dis were great poets, concerned to capture and project the poetic image even at the expense of the harmony sought by Jovan Dučić and Milan Rakić. Pandurović-Dis's work was also decidedly pessimisstic, open to the darker sides of humanity. In one of his more censorious moments Jovan Skerlić judged their poetry to be harmful to the health of the nation for whom it was more important to face the future with optimism. Bogdan Popović was less inclined to dismiss the work of the young poets and included in his 1911 \\"Anthology of Modern Serbian Lyric\\" (Antologija nove srpske lirike) two of Pandurović's poems, one of which has the title \\"Svetkovina\\" meaning holiday, particularly a religious festival. The lines evoke a scene in a lunatic asylum, beginning with the sonorously disturbing: \\"We went out of our minds one fine day\\" (Sišli smo s uma u sjajan dan). The poem was published in a collection called \\"Funeral Greetings\\" (Postmrtne počasti) from 1908. And one of Dis's 1911 collection \\"Drowned Souls\\" (Utopljene duše). (It had an odd sense of foreboding as the poet himself died when a boat on which he was travelling in the Adriatic in 1917 was torpedoed by a German submarine). At the outbreak of World War I, Pandurović enlisted in the Serbian Army as a volunteer; and as a soldier he served with conspicuous distinction for the first two years. Near the end of 1915 he was captured by the Austro-Hungarian army, and sent to a military prison in Neusiedl am See, a town in Burgenland, Austria, and then in the notorious Boldogason in Hungary. He survived the internment and by the end of the war he was secretary to Serbia's Minister of Culture and assistant director of the National Library of Serbia. Between the wars, he continued to translate Shakespeare, write poetry, contribute literary articles, working also as co-editor (with Velimir Živojinoviċ) of Misao: književno-politički časopis (Thought: A Literary-Political Magazine), published bi-monthly in Belgrade, from 1919 to 1937. Although Pandurević died in 1960, he had practically ceased writing at the outbreak of World War II. From the moment the communists took power in Yugoslavia in 1945, he refused to resume his writing activity. He died in Belgrade on 27 August 1960. Works His poems -- Posmrtne Pocasti / Posthumous Honours, Mostar, 1908; Dani i Noci / Days and Nights, Belgrade, 1912; and Okovane Slogove Zagreb, 1918—have found many readers almost immediately. Equally renowned were Panduroviċ's pulpit addresses in defence of Ksenija Atanasijević when she lost her professorship at the University of Belgrade. Though he was no orator, his appeal to reason was effective. He translated Victor Hugo's Kralj se zabavlja / Le roi s'amuse (1904); Edmond Rostand's Romanticne Duse / Les romanesques (1919 and 1920); Jean Racine's Athalie (Belgrade, 1913); Moliere's Tartuffe; and some the works of Shakespeare (including Hamlet, Richard III, Henry IV, and Macbeth), with Živojin Simić, are deservedly praised by critics Jovan Skerlić, Pavle Popović, and Bogdan Popović. He also wrote a critical work -- Ogledi iz estetike / Aesthetic Outlook, published in Belgrade in 1920.

At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps. In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment. In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the Royal Army Service Corps were in turn passed over to the RAOC. The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores. In 1964 the McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the Army Fire Service, barrack services, sponsorship of NAAFI (EFI) and the management of staff clerks from the same Corps. On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The Royal Logistic Corps (RLC). The permanent establishment of an Ordnance Office long predated that of a standing army in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-bowyers, master- fletchers, master-carpenters and master-smiths who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike matériel, and to their successors the storekeepers, clerks, artificers, armourers and storemen of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'. Predecessors of the RAOC Army Ordnance Corps Cap Badge (pre-First World War) Supply and repair of technical equipment, principally artillery and small arms, was the responsibility of the Master General of the Ordnance and the Board of Ordnance from the Middle Ages until they lost their independence in 1855. Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: =Before Crimea= The Board of Ordnance had its own military establishment consisting of the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers (who were not at that time part of the British Army). The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the civil establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not deployed elsewhere. In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, engineers and artillerymen received their commissions or patents from the Master-General of the Ordnance, as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold epaulettes indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-hilted sword and a cocked hat; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After Waterloo they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer. The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the Ordnance Yards, both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the theatre of war. Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance By the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future Royal Arsenal) had outgrown the Tower of London as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm. In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops in the field (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the Commissariat, a department of HM Treasury). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the theatre of war was achieved by the formation of artillery trains, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Board sought to place this ad hoc arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a Field Train Department. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior Commissary based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to Majors, Captains, subalterns and NCOs respectively). In peace time nothing more than a small cadre of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as Military Conductors in addition to the civilian staff. With regard to the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, the Field Train Department had additional responsibilities: it provided them with pay, clothing, medical supplies and camp equipment when deployed (while the Commissariat provided their food and forage). The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their pontoon bridges and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of artillery pieces in the field (other than those pertaining to the Royal Horse Artillery). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities). Between 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns. In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the Grand Depot (just off Woolwich Common) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was mobilized once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the Royal Waggon Train, first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare); after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command- structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department). =After Crimea= In the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC. The Military Store Department (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories. In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the Military Store Clerks Corps (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties. These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the Tower of London, Woolwich Arsenal and Weedon Bec, but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a Military Store Staff Corps (MSSC) to provide soldiers:HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67 initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower. In 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the Army Service Corps (ASC) under the Control Department. The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC. This arrangement lasted until 1876.Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152 The Control Department was disbanded in 1876. The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created Ordnance Stores Department (OSD). Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the Ordnance Store Corps (OSC). In 1894 there were further changes. The OSD was retitled the Army Ordnance Department (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the Royal Artillery (RA). In parallel the OSC was retitled the Army Ordnance Corps (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5 In 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \\"Royal\\" prefix in recognition of their service during the First World War in 1922. Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914 Red Barracks, Woolwich =Depots and other installations= The earliest depot for military stores was the Tower of London, headquarters of the Ordnance Office, which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at Woolwich which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the Royal Arsenal. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at Purfleet, replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at Weedon, alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192 and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When Woolwich Dockyard closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and linked by rail) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, harnesses, accoutrements and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent Royal Marine Barracks, linked to the nearby Dockyard); as Red Barracks, it would continue to serve as the regimental Depot, headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London. The former Barlby Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time). In addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of mobilization. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at Aldershot: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores. In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, Jersey, Gibraltar, Malta, Bermuda, Canada, St Helena, Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius and Straits Settlements. There was also a substantial detachment supporting the Anglo-Zulu War in Natal.Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II. p155 In 1895 the Royal Army Clothing Department, with its factory and depot at Pimlico, was taken over by the AOD which then became responsible for the provision of uniforms and other items of clothing for much of the army.Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II. p82 =Field units= British Army logistics in the Boer War: mule train, 1899. In 1855 Captain Henry Gordon (brother of the famous Gordon of Khartoum) left the Army and joined the Ordnance department;Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 22 From March that year until July 1856 he was sent to Balaklava to take charge of all stores for all branches of the army: the first time an Ordnance Storekeeper had been appointed in the field of battle. The following year, a memorandum was issued making it clear that, in future, a staff of Military Store officers, clerks, artificers and labourers should accompany troops at time of war to ensure abundant provision of equipment for immediate use together with effective maintenance of reserve stocks in the field. These arrangements were put into practice both in China and in New Zealand in 1860. The labourers and artificers were civilians, until the establishment of the Military Store Staff Corps in 1865. There was substantial support by the RAOC's predecessors for every late Victorian expedition with the major efforts being the campaigns in Egypt and the Sudan (1882-5 and 1898) and the Boer War (1899-1902). All campaigns required the support of very large numbers of troops, animals and equipment in hostile environments. They produced a well-developed system of stores dumps and repair facilities along extended lines of communication.Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II. p182 notes that the total strength of British forces of all types in the war 'did not fall far short of 450,000 while regular army strength never dropped below 151,000.' First World War 8-inch howitzer at Passchendaele, 1917. As with the rest of the British Army the AOD/AOC was transformed by the First World War. Both the sheer scale of the war and the increasing technical complexity created an organisational structure that, in its outlines, survives until today. The depots at Woolwich, Weedon and Pimlico were supplemented by the wholesale takeover of warehouses throughout the country and in early 1915 a depot was established at Didcot to be the major focus for the receipt and distribution of RAOC stores. Ammunition storage was also expanded dramatically and the former peacetime magazines at places such as Purfleet, Portsmouth and Plymouth were supplemented by purpose built depots at Bramley, Altrincham, Credenhill and Didcot. Inside a Base Supply Depot at Vendroux, 1917. On the Western Front a highly successful logistic infrastructure, largely rail based, was created to support the front. Parallel systems, but of less complexity, supported operations in Italy. Other expeditions such as Gallipoli, Salonika, Palestine and Mesopotamia brought supply challenges and a large logistic bases were established on the Egyptian Canal Zone and Basra.Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol III. pp192-217 1920–1945 Palestine, 1941. After the war there was considerable retrenchment. In the 1920s the RAOC's principal depots were Bramley (ammunition), Chilwell (general and surplus stores), Hereford (ammunition), Pimlico (clothing), Woolwich (gun stores and ammunition) and Weedon (small arms). In 1922 the RAOC headquarters, regimental depot and School of Instruction moved from Woolwich to Hilsea Barracks on the edge of Portsmouth. (The School provided education and training in all aspects of the Corps' work, with the exception of ammunition which was taught at Bramley, where the Army School of Ammunition was opened that same year.) The Royal Army Clothing Depot, Pimlico, closed in 1932 and its stock was mostly transferred to Didcot. In the 1930s re-armament and the mechanisation of the Army led to a redesign of the UK base. A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell, opened in 1937. The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. COD Branston was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot. At the outbreak of the Second World War there were five CODs: Branston, Chilwell, Didcot, Weedon and Woolwich. ATS working on a Churchill tank at an RAOC depot, 1942. Woolwich was prone to aerial bombardment, so from September 1939 the War Department leased part of an industrial estate in Greenford, which provided 632,000 square feet of covered accommodation. A further COD to hold non-vehicle technical stores opened at Donnington, Shropshire in 1940 (in order to remove critical items from Woolwich to a less vulnerable site) and purpose-built depots for both tracked and wheeled vehicles were opened across the country. Woolwich then ceased operating as a COD (though by the end of 1942 it was again being used for bulk storage, albeit as a sub-depot of COD Greenford). In the 1930s virtually all the Army's stockpile of ammunition was held at Bramley, which was vulnerable to air attack, so three new Central Ammunition Depots (CAD) were built: Serving south, central and northern England respectively, these were CAD Monkton Farleigh, Wiltshire (also known as CAD Corsham, an underground depot); CAD Nesscliffe, Shropshire; and CAD Longtown, Cumbria. By 1942 more storage capacity was required and another CAD was opened: Kineton. That same year a very large COD, widely spread out across the Oxfordshire countryside to mitigate the risk of bomb damage, opened at Bicester to hold stores principally to support the invasion of France. Forward of the UK base, a huge array of temporary depots were built to meet the rapidly changing pace of war. Base Ordnance Depots (BOD) and Base Ammunition Depots (BAD) sprung up all over the world wherever a major line of communication was established.Brigadier AH Fernyhough 'A History of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1920-45' RAOC, Blackdown 1966 lists BODs in West Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia as well as France and Italy. Major changes took place after 1942 when the REME absorbed most of the RAOC repair functions and the RAOC in turn took over the RASC's vehicle organisation. The more mobile nature of the Second World War also led to the creation of units at divisional and corps level with higher levels of mobility. The most notable of these was the ordnance field park, principally carrying vehicle and technical stores spares. Post-war to 1993 Wheelbarrow bomb disposal device being operated by a team from 321 EOD Coy RAOC, Northern Ireland 1978. During the war the RAOC HQ (together with the RAOC School) had moved from Hilsea to Middleton Stoney (Bicester); in 1946 it moved again to Matthew Barracks, Tidworth and shortly afterwards to Deepcut. The regimental depot was also moved from Hilsea, in 1946, to Feltham Barracks, Middlesex; in 1955 it too moved to Deepcut. Hilsea, which had been used by the US Army during the war, continued to be used (alongside Deepcut) as a training facility for RAOC-enlisted National Service recruits; with National Service coming to an end the Barracks closed in 1962 (but not before serving again, temporarily, as the regimental depot from 1960-1962 while Deepcut was being rebuilt). A major task that fell to the RAOC in the wake of the war was disposal of ammunition. As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, Ammunition Technicians and Ammunition Technical Officers at the Army School of Ammunition became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of 321 EOD Unit was sent to Northern Ireland to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with improvised explosive devices; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through the Troubles. In the period 1945–93 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew. At the same time, there was considerable development of warehousing techniques and information technology (the first move towards computerisation came with the opening of an Automated Data Processing Installation at Chilwell in 1963 and one at Bicester the following year.) In the mid-1960s new recruits were informed that 'The RAOC occupies nearly 90 different locations in the UK alone and world wide uses 86,000,000 square feet of storage space. Over 1,000,000 different items are held in stock and over 11,000,000 issues are made in a year'.Notes on the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, published in the wake of the 1964 McLeod changes. By 1980 the RAOC was reduced to two CODs at Bicester and Donnington (COD Chilwell was closing, CODs Branston and Didcot had closed in 1963 and Weedon in 1965 after being downgraded from a COD in 1957), two CADs at Kineton and Longtown (Nesscliffe had closed in 1959, Corsham in 1963 and Bramley in 1974) and three Central Vehicle Depots: Ludgershall for 'A' (armoured) vehicles, and Ashchurch and Hilton for 'B' ('soft-skinned') vehiclesRAOC Hilton (Historic Hansard: House of Commons debate, 18 March 1986). (CVD Marchington having closed in 1965, CVDs Feltham and Irvine in the early 1970s). Across the UK the structure of smaller Regional Depots, Ordnance Support Units (OSUs), Training Materiel Parks, supply depots and Ammunition Sub-Depots was steadily run down. A reconfiguration in the late 1960s provided four Regional Depots (Thatcham, Hereford, Catterick and Stirling) and nine OSUs: Aldershot, Ashford, Burscough, Colchester, Feltham, Old Dalby, Thetford, Tidworth and Woolwich (which had been downgraded following the closure of the Royal Ordnance Factory and the sale of the old Dockyard). At the height of the Northern Ireland troubles Ordnance Depot Kinnegar was a major logistic facility but is now much reduced. Overseas, 3 BOD in Singapore closed in 1972 leaving a Composite Ordnance Depot in Hong Kong (that finally closed shortly before handover in 1997). The Middle East logistic base withdrew from Egypt in 1956 – 5 BOD and 9 BAD closing in 1955 – and was partially re-established in Aden; in turn this closed in 1967 with facilities being established in Sharjah and Bahrain (these, in turn, closed in 1971). The Ordnance depot in Gibraltar, where the Board of Ordnance had first established a facility in 1704, was transferred to the Royal Navy in 1964; and the depot in Malta, dating from the 1830s, closed in March 1972. The Ordnance Depot in Cyprus became part of the Joint Logistic Unit in 1988. In Germany, 15 BOD and 3 Base Ammunition and Petrol Depot (BAPD) closed in 1992. Two post-war campaigns (Falklands 1982 and Gulf 1990/1) were unique in being fought in areas completely outside existing theatres. Temporary lines of communication were rapidly established that successfully managed huge surges in matériel.  Formation of Royal Logistic Corps  On 5 April 1993, following the Options for Change review, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps united with the Royal Corps of Transport, the Royal Pioneer Corps, the Army Catering Corps, and the Postal and Courier Service of the Royal Engineers, to form the Royal Logistic Corps. Later that year the RLC withdrew from the Tower of London, where the RAOC had continued to maintain a centuries-old link;Commemorative plaque, New Armouries, Tower of London and the following year the last vestige of the once-vast ordnance depot left Woolwich, with the closure of Royal Arsenal (West) and departure of the Ordnance QAD (Quality Assurance Directorate). Appointments in the RAOC =Appointments in the RAOC= Prior to 1981/82 the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, in common with the rest of the British Army, used the idiosyncratic system of staff titles that was unique to British and most Commonwealth armies. After 1981 in NATO assigned units, principally those in British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), the standard NATO system was adopted with all appointments elsewhere changing the following year. The senior RAOC appointment was Director Equipment and Ordnance Stores (DEOS) − always a Major-General − which during the 1920s became Director Ordnance Services (DOS). DOS was also a title given to senior RAOC officers at major commands such as Middle East Command, 21st Army Group and in more recent times BAOR. After the Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS). Following the huge expansion of the RAOC in the Second World War the senior RAOC major general was designated Controller Ordnance Services (COS) from 1942Brigadier AH Fernyhough 'History of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1920-45' RAOC.

The full- dress uniform of the RAOC had evolved from that worn by the Field Train Department in the eighteenth century, itself derived from the uniform of the Royal Artillery. Consisting of a blue tunic with red collar and cuffs and blue trousers with a double red stripe, it continued to be worn by the band (and in mess-dress form) until the corps' amalgamation. The RAOC Band had first been formed in 1922; the regimental march (chosen by its first Bandmaster, WOI R. T. Stevens, as appropriate to the Corps' role and to its artisans) was The Village Blacksmith. In common with the Royal Artillery, the RAOC had St Barbara as its patron saint. The garrison church, first at Hilsea and then at Deepcut, was dedicated in her name; the pulpit, organ, stained glass windows and several memorials were transferred from the former to the latter when Hilsea Barracks closed in 1962. There was also a St Barbara's Church at CAD Bramley, which had originally come from the depot in Pimlico; having done service in Bramley for 52 years it was again disassembled in 1978 and moved to Didcot. =The RAOC Gazette= The official journal of the corps was the RAOC Gazette. Recruiting Before the Second World War, RAOC recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 2 inches tall (5 feet 4 inches for Driver Mechanics) and could enlist up to 25 years of age. They initially enlisted for three years with the colours and a further nine years with the reserve. Fitters could also choose six years with the colours and six years in the reserve, or eight and four years. Clerks and Storemen enlisted for six years and six years. They trained at the RAOC Depot, Hilsea Barracks, Portsmouth, before proceeding to specialist trade training. Armourers were only recruited from boy entrants and enlisted for twelve years. Armament Artificers trained at the Military College of Science, Woolwich for fifteen months. Half of them were serving soldiers who were already qualified fitters. Armament Artificers had to be at least 22 years of age and could enlist up to 30; they enlisted for twelve years and were promoted Staff Sergeant as soon as they had completed training.War Office, His Majesty's Army, 1938 See also * Conductor (British Army) * Staff Sergeant Major * Allum Green * Army engineering maintenance References External links * RAOC Forum * RAOC Association * RAOC ex Boy Soldiers Association * Sua Tela Tonanti Lodge No 8003 under the United Grand Lodge of England - the Corps (and RLC) associated Freemason's lodge British administrative corps Royal Logistic Corps Military units and formations disestablished in 1993 Military units and formations established in 1918 ","title":"Royal Army Ordnance Corps"},{"id":"2939876","text":"Woollybush, woolly bush or woolly-bush is a common name for plants of the genus Adenanthos with leaves deeply divided into long, soft, slender laciniae, often covered in a fine down of soft hairs.

Vladislav Petković Dis (; born Vladislav Petković; 12 March 1880 – 16 May/29 May 1917) was a Serbian poet, part of the impressionism movement in European poetry, known as Moderna/Symbolism in Serbia. He was born in 1880 in Zablaće, near Čačak in Serbia and died in 1917 on a boat on the Ionian Sea after being hit by a torpedo. He was also known as a war poet. Biography Vladislav Petković was born in Zablaće, a village near Čačak, in the Principality of Serbia. He made his way to Čačak, graduating from the Gymnasium and Teacher's College in 1902. He was appointed temporary teacher at Prlita, a village near the town of Zaječar. He did not like teaching, and his small output of poetry brought him little income. In 1903, he moved to Belgrade, and became prominent in the literary life there, when his poems appeared in Idila, a literary magazine.Vladislav Petković chose his appellation \\"Dis\\" as a repetition of the middle syllable of his first name, but also as the name of the Roman god of the underworld. He was a frequent evening visitor to the Belgrade's kafanas in Skadarlija and elsewhere where he would drink and compose new verse at the same time. He obtained an appointment as a customs official with the municipal government, giving him a good income and leisure time to write. He was named co-editor, with Sima Pandurović, of Literary Week (Književna nedelja). Both Petković-Dis and Pandurović were considered the enfants terribles of their literary world (both being under the influence of Charles Baudelaire and other French Symbolists, like Šantić, Dučić, Rakić, Ćorović, and even Skerlić before he abandoned the movement). After the demise of the magazine, he married Hristina-Tinka, with whom he had two children, Gordana and Mutimir. He wrote Spomenik (Monument) in anticipation of World War I: > And it still seems that, > as my soul dreams on, > the monument lives on, > ready for eternity, > reborn into new traditions, > tempering young ambitions > to erect the next monument. During the outbreak of the First Balkan War he was conscripted by the military as a journalist. He was the war correspondent covering battles of the Serbian Army in the First Balkan War (1912), Second Balkan War (1913), and World War I that followed. In 1915 he joined the Serbian army in their retreat to Corfu. From Corfu Petković-Dis was sent to France to recuperate and write about the entire tragedy. In 1917, on his way back, on either 16 May or 29 May (varying sources), he became a civilian war casualty after boarding an Italian ship, destined for Corfu. It was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine in the Ionian Sea. He is said to have predicted his unfortunate destiny, for one of his most famous collections of poems is called Drowned Souls, earning him the reputation of a cursed poet. He was 37 years old. Poetry His nickname Dis was derived from the three letters in the middle of his first name \\"Vla-DIS- lav\\". He introduced irrational and subconscious images into Serbian lyric poetry. Some of his most famous poems are Možda spava (She May Be Sleeping) and Spomenik (Monument). In Spomenik, Petković Dis dreamed of a monument: > It has a long life, > Today it descends into new legends, > To prepare our descendents for the next monument. > Petković Dis was writing in 1913, just after Serbia wrested Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire and installed an obelisk on the site of the famous medieval battle when Kosovo was severed from Serbia by the Ottomans. Dis's poetry was not well received at the beginning by Jovan Skerlić, one of the most distinguished Serbian literary critics of that time, who did not care for the poems' morbid and sinister tone.

Variable in habit and leaf shape, it is the only genus in the family where solitary flowers are the norm. It was discovered in 1791, and formally published by Jacques Labillardière in 1805. The type species is Adenanthos cuneatus, and 33 species are recognised. The genus is placed in subfamily Proteoideae, and is held to be most closely related to several South African genera. Endemic to Australia, its centre of diversity is southwest Western Australia, where 31 species occur. The other two species occur in South Australia and western Victoria (Australia). They are mainly pollinated by birds. Description =Habit= The growth habits of Adenanthos species range from prostrate shrubs to small trees, with most species occurring as erect shrubs. There are two basic growth forms. Plants that lack a lignotuber have a single stem. Such plants usually grow into fairly erect shrubs; and sometimes the main stem thickens to become a trunk, resulting in a small tree. Plants with a lignotuber, on the other hand, have many stems arising from the underground rootstock, usually resulting in smaller shrubs with a mallee habit.Nelson (1978): 305–306. =Leaf= A. sericeus leaf As with most other Proteaceae genera, leaf shape is highly variable in Adenanthos. Though the leaves are always simple (as in not compound), they may be lobed, or even deeply divided into segments, usually by three.Nelson (1978): 306–307. This segmentation has its extreme in the distinctive leaf form characteristic of those Adenanthos species known as woollybushes, in which the leaf is segmented, sometimes many times, into long thin laciniae, round in cross- section (terete), and often covered in a fine down of soft hairs. The number of laciniae varies greatly. In A. pungens, for example, the leaves may be entire, or there may be a single segmentation into two or three laciniae; in A. sericeus, the leaf is repeatedly tri-segmented into as many as 50 laciniae. This leaf form is seen in around half of the species. Other common leaf forms include a wedge-shaped (cuneate) leaf with shallow lobes along the apex, seen, for example, in A. cuneatus and A. stictus; the oval-shaped (obovate) entire leaves of A. ellipticus and A. obovatus; and the long thin leaves of A. detmoldii and A. barbiger. Only two species have leaves that are sharply pointed (pungent): A. pungens has a woollybush form of leaf with pungent laciniae, and A. acanthophyllus is a flat (laminar), deeply lobed leaf with sharp points along its margins. Some sources state that some leaves of some species are tipped with extrafloral nectaries. =Inflorescence and flower= Flower of A. sericeus, before (left) and after (right) anthesis Unusually for members of the family Proteaceae, Adenanthos flowers are solitary, rather than clustered together in large showy inflorescences. In fact, morphologically speaking, the Adenanthos flower does occur in an inflorescence, but one in which the number of flowers has been reduced to one, leaving only a few vestigial clues to the elaborate structure from which it derived. Each flower is positioned at the end of a short peduncle. The peduncle has minute basal bracts at its base, and sometimes at its midpoint, providing evidence of the loss of some lateral axes. At the end of the peduncle sits the flower, sessile or very nearly so, and surrounded at the base by an imbricate involucre. Very rarely, an involucre may enclose two flowers rather than just one, providing further evidence of reduction from a complex, multi-flowered inflorescence.Nelson (1978): 308–310. Inflorescences occur individually at the end of branches (terminal) or at branch junctions (axillary). Most species have terminal inflorescences, and in these cases the inflorescences are usually subtended by leaves, if not branchlets, so the flowers are obscured by the foliage. The species with axillary inflorescences tend to be much more showy. The flower of Adenanthos is structurally the same as that of many other Proteaceae. Flower parts occur in multiples of four (tetramerous), but the four tepals are fused into a long, narrow perianth-tube topped by a closed cup (the limb); the filament of each stamen is fused along its entire length with the midrib of a tepal, so that the anthers appear almost sessile, trapped within the limb; and the four carpels form a single compound pistil, the apex of which is also trapped within the limb. Four prominent scale-like nectaries surround the ovary. Structurally, the flowers of most Adenanthos species are radially symmetrical (actinomorphic); but in the small section Eurylaema, one anther is sterile and reduced to a staminode, rendering the flowers structurally merely bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). In both cases the flower soon becomes zygomorphic, as the pistil grows faster and longer than the perianth tube, causing the style to flex until it pushes its way out through a slit in the perianth-tube, which bends away from the style. The apex of the style, called the stigma in most flowering plants, is often referred to as the style-end in Proteaceae, since it performs two distinct functions: it performs the usual stigmatic role of pollen-collector, but also functions as a pollen-presenter. At anthesis, both the style-end and the anthers are trapped within the limb, so that when the anthers release their pollen, the pollen adheres to the style-end. Shortly after pollen release, the tips of the tepals separate, causing the limb to break apart. The style-end is released, the style springs erect, and the flower's pollen is thus held aloft where it may be deposited on the face of a nectarivorous bird. Unlike some other Proteaceae genera, the style-end of Adenanthos shows little evidence of adaption to either of its dual roles. In most species is it slightly broader than the style, and conical in shape, but in section Eurylaema is oval and flattened. In both cases the stigmatic groove is a furrow on one side of the style end. =Fruit and seed= The fruit of Adenanthos is a simple dry hard-shelled nut that surrounds the seed but does not adhere to it (an achene). It is brown, ellipsoid in shape, and ranges in size from three to eight mm long, and one to two millimetres wide. It is not often seen on the plant because it develops within the involucre of the flower, which persists long after the flower itself has withered and fallen. By the time the fruit is mature, the involucre has dried and spread, so that the fruit is free to fall to the ground as soon as it abscisses from the plant. In some species this happens as soon as the fruit is mature; in others, the fruit may be retained on the plant for some time.Nelson (1978): 313. The production of seedless fruit (parthenocarpy) is common, as is seed abortion (stenospermocarpy). When a seed is present, it is white, ellipsoidal, and nearly fills the fruit. Taxonomy =Early collections= Early explorers who could have seen and collected Adenanthos include Willem de Vlamingh and William Dampier. Vlamingh explored the Swan River and visited Shark Bay in 1697. He almost certainly collected plant specimens, as two south-west Australian endemics were published many years later, based on specimens for which the collection cannot be attributed to any other known voyage. Two years after Vlamingh, Dampier visited the north-west coast, collecting around 40 specimens of 23 plant species from sites at Shark Bay and in the Dampier Archipelago. There is no record in either case of specimens of Adenanthos being seen or collected, but A. cygnorum is fairly common at the Swan River, and A. acanthophyllus occurs at Shark Bay, albeit only at the southern end of Peron Peninsula, where neither expedition is likely to have visited.Nelson (1975) 1. The first known collection of the genus was made by Archibald Menzies, surgeon and naturalist to the Vancouver Expedition of 1791–1795. The Vancouver expedition discovered King George Sound in September 1791, and during their stay there Menzies collected specimens of many plant species, including two Adenanthos species, A. sericeusNelson (1975) 2: A106. Jacques Labillardière, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse, visited Esperance Bay on the south coast of Western Australia in 1792, collecting A. cuneatus there. In December 1801 and January 1802, at the start of Matthew Flinders' famous circumnavigation of Australia, HMS Investigator visited King George Sound for several weeks. The botanist to the voyage, Robert Brown, made an extensive plant specimen collection, including A. cuneatus, A. sericeus and A. obovatus. A few months later he collected what would become the type specimen of A. terminalis from near Port Lincoln. As HMS Investigator was commencing its anticlockwise circumnavigation, a French expedition under Nicolas Baudin was exploring the coastline in a clockwise direction. The two expeditions famously encountered each other in 1802 at what would be named Encounter Bay in South Australia, then Baudin continued westward, arriving at King George Sound in February 1803. There, botanist Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour, assisted by gardener's boy Antoine Guichenot, collected plant specimens including A. cuneatus, A. obovatus and A. sericeus. =Publication= Annotation on the holotype of A. cuneatus, showing Labillardière's derivation of the name Adenanthos The genus Adenanthos was first described and named by Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. Though he did not give an explicit etymology for the genus name therein, the type specimen for A. cuneatus contains annotations that show Labillardière experimenting with various Greek word stems, listing in each case the corresponding Latin transliteration and meaning. He eventually settled on Adenanthos, formed from the Greek stems άδὴν (aden, glandula, \\"gland\\") and ανθος (anthos, flos, \\"flower\\"). Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson states that the name refers to the prominent and copiously productive nectaries. Labillardière published three species, naming them A. cuneata, A. sericea and A. obovata, giving them feminine gender consistent with his view of the gender of the genus name. He did not say which of the three was to serve as type species for the genus, but Nelson has since chosen A. cuneatus as lectotype, since Labillardière's description of it is referred to by the descriptions of the other two species.Nelson (1978): 318. Labillardière also did not acknowledge a collector of the specimens upon which these names were based, and so it was long thought that Labillardière himself collected them. However, neither A. obovatus nor the type subspecies of A. sericeus occurs at any location visited by Labillardière, suggesting that some of his specimens were obtained from some other collector whom he failed to credit. The realisation of this fact prompted a re-evaluation of the type material by Nelson, who attributed their collection to Leschenault.Nelson (1978): 331. This view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously. =Relationships within Proteaceae= The framework for classification of genera within Proteaceae was laid by L. A. S. Johnson and Barbara Briggs in their influential 1975 monograph \\"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\\". Their arrangement has been refined somewhat over the ensuing three decades, most notably by Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker in 2006. Proteaceae is divided into five subfamilies, with Adenanthos placed in subfamily Proteoideae because of its cluster roots, solitary ovules and indehiscent fruits. On the basis of phylogenetic data it is further placed in tribe Leucodendreae, a morphologically heterogeneous group with no obvious diagnostic characters, and dominated by South African genera. Within Leucodendreae it appears as sister clade to a clade comprising the South African subtribe Leucodendrinae, and is therefore placed alone in subtribe Adenanthinae. The placement of Adenanthos in Proteaceae can be summarised as follows: :Family Proteaceae ::Subfamily Bellendenoideae (1 genus) ::Subfamily Persoonioideae (2 tribes, 5 genera) ::Subfamily Symphionematoideae (2 genera) ::Subfamily Proteoideae :::::(6 genera incertae sedis) :::Tribe Conospermeae (2 subtribes, 3 genera) :::Tribe Petrophileae (2 genera) :::Tribe Proteeae (2 genera) :::Tribe Leucadendreae ::::Subtribe Isopogoninae (1 genus) ::::Subtribe Adenanthinae :::::Adenanthos ::::Subtribe Leucadendrinae (10 genera) ::Subfamily Grevilleoideae (4 tribes, 14 subtribes, 47 genera) =Relationships within the genus= The first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos was published in 1870 by George Bentham, in the fifth volume of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections on the basis of floral characteristics. Two species were unusual in having flowers with one sterile stamen, and perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle; these were placed in A. sect. Eurylaema. The remaining twelve known species were placed in A. sect. Stenolaema. A phenetic analysis of the genus undertaken by Ernest Charles Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which the members of A. sect. Eurylaema occurred together.Nelson (1975) 1: 130. Nelson therefore retained Bentham's two sections in his 1978 revision of Adenanthos, though A. sect Stenolaema was renamed to the autonym A. sect. Adenanthos in accordance with modern rules of botanical nomenclature. He further divided A. sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, A. subsect. Anaclastos and A. subsect. Adenanthos, but discarded them again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender. This resulted in orthographic changes to all species names in the genus; for example, A. obovata became A. obovatus.Nelson (1995): 324. Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos is as follows: A. detmoldii :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. detmoldii :::A. barbiger :::A. obovatus :::A. × pamela ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens ::::A. pungens subsp. pungens ::::A. pungens subsp. effusus :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens ::::A. glabrescens subsp. glabrescens ::::A. glabrescens subsp. exasperatus :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus ::::A. sericeus subsp. sericeus ::::A. sericeus subsp. sphalma :::A. × cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum ::::A. cygnorum subsp. cygnorum ::::A. cygnorum subsp. chamaephyton :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus Species *A. detmoldii *A. barbiger *A. obovatus *A. × pamela *A. drummondii *A. dobagii *A. apiculatus *A. linearis *A. pungens *A. pungens subsp. pungens *A. pungens subsp. effusus *A. gracilipes *A. venosus *A. dobsonii *A. glabrescens *A. glabrescens subsp. glabrescens *A. glabrescens subsp. exasperatus *A. ellipticus *A. cuneatus *A. stictus *A. ileticos *A. forrestii *A. eyrei *A. cacomorphus *A. flavidiflorus *A. argyreus *A. macropodianus *A. terminalis *A. sericeus *'A. sericeus subsp. sericeus'' *'A. sericeus subsp. sphalma'' *A. × cunninghamii *A. oreophilus *A. cygnorum *A. cygnorum subsp. cygnorum *A. cygnorum subsp. chamaephyton *A. meisneri *A. velutinus *A. filifolius *A. labillardierei *A. acanthophyllus =Common names= Nelson has published a thorough but somewhat light-hearted analysis of the common names used for this genus. He notes that the only common name applied to the genus as a whole is stick-in-jug (sometimes stick-in-the-jug), but argues that this seems to be in use only within Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM; now the Department of Environment and Conservation). Be that as it may, the name dates back at least to 1970, when Western Australian State Botanist Charles Gardner gave it as the common name of Adenanthos in the second edition of John Stanley Beard's A Descriptive Catalogue of West Australian Plants. Nelson also notes that the phrase stick-in-jug does not appear in any common name of a species. The common names of species are instead based around several other generic terms that do not apply to the genus as a whole: Closeup of a branch tip of A. cygnorum. * Thirteen species of Adenanthos have leaves deeply divided into long, soft, slender laciniae, often covered in a fine down of soft hairs, giving them a soft, silky feel, in stark contrast to the sclerophyllous plants that dominate both the geographic range and taxonomic family of Adenanthos. These are collectively known as woollybushes, and many of these species contain woollybush in their common names. * Those species that lack the leaves characteristic of woollybushes usually have common names based on the term jugflower, or, in one case, the semantically similar basket flower. * However these common names appear to be in use exclusively in Western Australia, as the two species of Adenanthos that occur outside Western Australia are both woollybushes, yet have common names based on the term gland flower, which is also used in the common name of A. barbiger (hairy glandflower), a Western Australia jugflower species. * Finally, several species, mostly rare and endangered, have been given common names based on the genus name adenanthos itself; for example A. ileticos (Toolinna Adenanthos). Distribution and habitat The centre of diversity for the genus is Southwest Western Australia, to which 31 of the 33 species are endemic. The south coast of Western Australia, between the Stirling Range and the Fitzgerald River area, is particular diverse, with 17 species occurring on the Esperance Plains alone. This is one of two areas dominated by kwongan heath, a vegetation complex renowned for its species richness and high levels of endemism; the other area of kwongan, further north on the west coast around Mount Lesueur, harbours surprisingly few Adenanthos species. Species occur throughout most of the southwest. In northern areas, where there are fewer species, the genus does not extend into drier inland areas, being absent from northern parts of the Avon Wheatbelt region. To the south, however, they extend well inland, extending even beyond the southwest into the neighbouring desert: A. argyreus occurs as far inland as Southern Cross. Eastwards along the south coast, the genus occurs in disjunct populations on isolated pockets of siliceous sand surrounded by the calcareous soils of the Great Australian Bight. The most easterly occurrence in Western Australia is at Twilight Cove. The two species that occur outside southwest Western Australia are Adenanthos macropodianus (Kangaroo Island glandflower), which is endemic to Kangaroo Island; and Adenanthos terminalis (yellow glandflower), which occurs in South Australia on the Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, and from Adelaide eastwards into western Victoria. Ecology A range of honeyeater species have been observed feeding at Adenanthos flowers, including Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill), Anthochaera chrysoptera (little wattlebird), Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera (crescent honeyeater), Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Gliciphila melanops (tawny-crowned honeyeater), Zosterops lateralis (silvereye) and Melithreptus brevirostris (brown-headed honeyeater). One study found that the amount of time that birds spent feeding at a site was strongly correlated with the abundance of Banksia sessilis (parrotbush), and seemed unrelated to the amount of Adenanthos there; yet these birds nonetheless fed at Adenanthos flowers.

A few years later, they moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana, where the young Patterson found work in a printing office and with a watchmaker and jeweler.  Career  When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Patterson enlisted in the Eleventh Regiment of the Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He returned home in 1862, and went to college first at Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University), then at Wabash College. Patterson was admitted to the bar in 1867 and began his practice in Crawfordsville. In 1872, he moved to Denver, where he started a law practice and was city attorney in 1873 and 1874. Patterson's political career began when he became a member of the Democratic National Committee in 1874 (a post he held until 1880). He was then elected as a Democrat to be a Delegate from the Colorado Territory to the 44th Congress (1875–76), stepping down when the Territory became a State. James B. Belford, a Republican, was initially elected as Colorado's first Congressman, but Patterson successfully contested his election and served in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 45th Congress (1877–79). Patterson chose not to stand for re-election in 1878. After leaving Congress, Patterson resumed the practice of law in Denver and purchased first the Rocky Mountain News in 1890 and later the Denver Times. During these years, Patterson was twice an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor of Colorado including in 1888, when he was defeated by Republican Job Adams Cooper. Patterson returned to national politics in 1900 when he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate, serving a single term (1901–1907) and refusing to stand for re- election. While a senator, Patterson served on the United States Senate Committee on the Philippines, which investigated alleged war crimes committed during the Philippine–American War. After leaving the Senate, Patterson published his newspaper until his death.  Death  Patterson's remains are interred in Fairmount Cemetery in Denver.

Peter Francis Bell (born 1 March 1976) is a former Australian rules footballer for the Fremantle Football Club and the North Melbourne Football Club. He played as a rover (or follower). A former captain of the Fremantle Football Club, Bell was twice named as a member of the All-Australian Team. He was an acclaimed ball-winner and had more than 30 possessions in a game on 39 occasions in his career. Early life Bell was born in Cheju Island, South Korea, the son of a Korean mother, Kyung Ae, and an American father. In 1979 he was adopted by an Australian couple who were in South Korea as Christian missionaries. Bell spent his formative years in Kojonup, Western Australia. He was educated at Aquinas College, PerthCrikey - Famous alumni on Latham's hit list and the University of Western Australia, where he obtained a Bachelor of Laws. AFL career =Fremantle (1995)= In late 1994, Bell, who was at that time playing with the South Fremantle Football Club in the West Australian Football League, became one of the first two players signed by the Fremantle Dockers, which made its debut in the Australian Football League the following year. He won the best and fairest award at South Fremantle in 1994. Despite kicking two goals with his first two kicks in AFL football, Bell failed to make an impression on Dockers' coach Gerard Neesham, who regarded him as too slow a runner to be a successful AFL player. Bell was selected for only two games in 1995. =North Melbourne (1996-2000)= He was delisted at the end of that season, worked hard to improve his leg speed, and was picked up in the 1996 Pre-season draft, by North Melbourne, where he achieved regular selection and acclaim for his courageous, energetic and skilled performances under coach Denis Pagan. Bell was a premiership player with the Kangaroos in 1996 and 1999, and was named an All-Australian on the bench in 1999. He scored four goals and had 31 possessions in the 1999 Grand Final to be one of the Roos best on the day. In 2000, he won the North Melbourne best and fairest award, the Syd Barker Medal. =Fremantle (2001-2008)= right At the end of 2000, Fremantle sought his return and Bell was traded back to his original club. As it happened, 2001 was a disastrous season for the Dockers, culminating in the dismissal of coach Damian Drum. Bell won the Doig Medal for the Dockers' best and fairest player that year, and was one of the very few shining lights in a season where the Dockers recorded just two victories. These two wins were in part due to outstanding performances from Bell, who gathered thirty-eight possessions and two goals against Hawthorn in round 18, and forty-four disposals and three goals against Adelaide in round 22. The following year he was appointed captain and in 2003 the club made the finals for the first time. Bell was once again an All-Australian, this time as a follower. He continued his good form into 2004, winning another Doig Medal. However, Fremantle's team performances were not as good, and in both 2004 and 2005 they narrowly missed making the finals. 2006 started poorly, but Bell was a leading player in Freo's record setting 9-game winning streak to finish in the top four for the first time, and also a member of the team that beat Melbourne in the second semi final to record Fremantle's first ever finals game win. Despite offering to hand over the captaincy to Matthew Pavlich in 2003, he remained captain for five seasons until the end of the 2006 season. At Subiaco Oval, enthusiastic supporters rung a bell (a play on his name) whenever Bell got a possession.

He was a member of the State Assembly, the State Senate, and Deputy Secretary for Public Safety of the State of New York. Political career Balboni entered politics as a Republican. On February 20, 1990, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Kemp Hannon to the State Senate. In the Assembly Balboni voted against funds for the elderly on Long Island. He was roundly criticized for voting against funding for New York State's most vulnerable populations, including the physically handicapped. 3 Assembly Victors Favor Death Penalty in the New York Times on February 21, 1990 Balboni was re-elected four times and remained in the Assembly until 1997, sitting in the 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st and 192nd New York State Legislatures. In November 1997, he was elected to the New York State Senate, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Michael J. Tully Jr.. Balboni was re-elected several times and remained in the Senate until 2006, sitting in the 192nd, 193rd, 194th, 195th and 196th New York State Legislatures. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs, he spoke out for New York's need to receive additional Homeland Security funds. Because of his reputation for garnering support across party lines, it was rumored that he would seek the Republican nomination for Attorney General in 2006. That would have opened his competitive, strongly probably Democratic-leaning, district to a threat from the Democrats. He chose not to run after pressure from Senate Republican Leader Joseph Bruno, to help the Republican Party retain its slim majority in the State Senate. Balboni was re-elected in 2006, winning 56% of the votes. On December 26, 2006, New York State Governor-elect Spitzer announced that Balboni would be appointed Deputy Secretary for Public Safety, requiring Balboni to resign his Senate seat. The move triggered a special election on February 6, 2007. For political reasons, Balboni sided with the Democrats, and refused to endorse the Republican candidate, former friend and colleague Nassau County Clerk Maureen O'Connell, who lost the election to Democratic Nassau County Legislator Craig M. Johnson. In his role as head of the NYS Office of Public Safety, Balboni oversaw homeland security and criminal justice agencies for Spitzer. These include the State Police, Department of Corrections, Division of Criminal Justice Services, the Division of Parole, and Office of Homeland Security. He coordinated homeland security and law enforcement policy, and served as state liaison to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In January, 2009, Balboni announced he would be leaving the Paterson administration to work in the private sector as a partner with Navigators Global, a government relations and communications consulting firm. In September, 2009, Balboni started Greater New York Health Care Facilities which is a non-profit trade association serving the needs of the long term care community in the greater New York metropolitan area and beyond, while currently serving as the Executive Director. In August 2010, Balboni left his position at Navigators Global to join Cardinal Point Strategies as a Principle and Senior Vice President in their Government Solutions Group In August 2012, Balboni became the Founder of RedLand Strategies, a consulting firm which sits at the intersection of Public Safety, Government Relations, Media Management and Business Development.

He focused on dodecasyllable and hendecasyllable verse, which allowed him to achieve beautiful rhythm and rhyme in his poems. He was quite a perfectionist and therefore only published two collections of poems (1903, 1912). He wrote largely about death and non-existence, keeping the tone sceptical and ironic. Two of his most well-known poems are An Honest Song (Iskrena pesma), A Desperate Song (Očajna pesma), Jefimija, Simonida and At Gazi-Mestan (Na Gazi-Mestanu). He was a member of the Serbian Royal Academy (1934). Biography =Early life= Rakić was born on 18 September 1876 in Belgrade to father Mita and mother Ana (née Milićević). His father, educated abroad, was Serbia's Minister of Finance (1888) and his mother was the daughter of Serbian writer Milan Milićević. He finished elementary school (grade school) and high school (gymnasium) in Belgrade. He completed law school in Paris. It was in Paris that he, like Jovan Dučić, came under the influence of French Symbolist poets. They both had learned to admire French culture and had dreamed of a better world after the war. After returning to Belgrade from Paris he became a diplomat (also like Dučić) for the Serbian (and later Yugoslav) government and remained in that job until nearly his death, representing the country abroad. =Personal life= His sister Ljubica was married to Milan Grol; and his wife Milica was the daughter of Ljubomir Kovačević, a distinguished Serbian historian and politician. =Death= He died prematurely in 1938 in Zagreb after a surgical operation.

The word Panaeolus is Greek for \\"all variegated\\", alluding to the spotted gills of the mushrooms produced.  Characteristics  These fungi are mostly dung and grassland species, some of which are quite common in Europe and North America. The gills of Panaeolus do not deliquesce as do the members of the related genera Coprinellus and Coprinopsis. Members of Panaeolus can also be mistaken for Psathyrella, however the latter genus is usually found growing on wood or lignin-enriched soils and has brittle stipes. The gills of these mushrooms are black or grey and have a spotty, speckled or cloudy appearance, caused by the way that the dark spores ripen together in tiny patches on the gill surface; different patches darken at different times. The spores are smooth.Meinhard Moser, translated by Simon Plant: Keys to Agarics and Boleti (Roger Phillips 1983) The closely related genus Panaeolina shares the spotted gills but they are dark brown (not black) and the spores are ornamented. This genus is sometimes treated as part of Panaeolus.Mushroom expert page on Panaeolus foenisecii gives further references using both naming choices. The spores are smooth or roughened, with a germ pore, and all species except for Panaeolus foenisecii have a jet black spore print.  Edibility  No members of Panaeolus are used for food, though some are used as a psychedelic drug. Thirteen species of Panaeolus contain the hallucinogen psilocybin including Panaeolus cyanescens and Panaeolus cinctulus. The bluing hallucinogenic members of this genus are sometimes segregated into a separate genus, Copelandia. Several members of this genus are known to contain psilocin and psilocybin and it is suspected that a number of other members of this genus contain unidentified psychoactive compounds. All members of this genus contain serotonin derivatives.

He also served as a general authority in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as one of the seven presidents of the Seventy. Early life Stevenson was born in Gibraltar to British parents. His family moved to the United States when he was young. As a young man, he was living in Pontiac, Michigan when he was contacted by a group of Latter Day Saint missionaries, including Joseph Smith, who were on a return leg of a trip to Upper Canada. Stevenson joined the Latter Day Saint church and relocated to its headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio in 1834. He later relocated with the main body of Latter Day Saints to Missouri, then Nauvoo, Illinois, and finally Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. LDS Church service Stevenson also made six missionary journeys, for up to five years at a time. These included three missions to Europe, two missions to the southern United States, and one mission to Mexico. He is recorded as having traveled the most miles under his own expense of any missionary in the history of the LDS Church. Stevenson settled in Salt Lake City with the first group of Mormon pioneers in 1847, and spent the first five years there getting established, and traveling Utah with Brigham Young and other church authorities to help oversee the establishment of several new settlements, before leaving on one of his missions in 1852. Stevenson also served as the co-leader of one of the Utah pioneer teams in 1855, and served as the leader of a second one in 1859. Like most prominent Mormon leaders at the time, Stevenson practiced plural marriage, eventually marrying seven simultaneous wives, including two sets of sisters. He had at least 24 children. Writings Stevenson wrote and self- published a biography of Joseph Smith in 1893, entitled Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet. Today it is the earliest surviving documentary source supporting the story of Smith having taught prior to 1836 that he had seen God and Jesus Christ as two separate beings in his First Vision. A large collection of Stevenson's journals are available and have served as a significant historical resource. They are kept at the Special Collections department of the Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University. One of the buildings at the LDS Church's Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, is named the Edward Stevenson Building, and his portrait hangs in the lobby.

Sex Madness is a 1938 exploitation film directed by Dwain Esper, along the lines of Reefer Madness, supposedly to warn teenagers and young adults of the dangers of venereal diseases, specifically syphilis. The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Sex Madness Retrieved October 21, 2016 Plot This exploitation film belongs to the social guidance genre of quasi-documentary narratives, which exhort young adults to follow particular moral and social prescriptions related to sexuality and drug use. The film centers on Paul Lorenz, a \\"concerned citizen\\" alarmed at the spread of venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea. However, at a New York City burlesque show, several protagonists are more intent on engagement in sexual pleasure, regardless of the subsequent costs. They include Paul's own son Tom, burlesque dancer Sheila Wayne (who has syphilis), and two secretaries, lesbian Peggy and Betty, whom she is trying to seduce. However, one figure is not amongst them—Millicent Hamilton, a reformed former burlesque dancer. Millicent won a beauty contest in her hometown, which led her to New York, but a \\"casting couch\\" sexual encounter led her to contract syphilis. Millicent is told by her physician, Dr. Hamilton, that her condition can be cured, but only after slow, and painstaking treatment, and she should reject quack pseudo-cures. Millicent consents to this, eager to return to her home town and marry her boyfriend Wendell, but will she heed the doctor's warnings? And what will the consequences be if she does not? Wild parties, lesbianism, and premarital sex are portrayed or heavily implied in various scenes. The promotion of the film for \\"educational\\" purposes allowed it to portray taboo subjects that were otherwise forbidden by the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, especially after those restrictions were strictly imposed on Hollywood productions after July 1934. Status The film has fallen into the public domain and can be freely downloaded from the Internet Archive. Sex Madness Revealed In 2018, the film Sex Madness Revealed was released by Kino Lorber. Sex Madness Revealed features an audio commentary track over the original film, which features comedian Patton Oswalt and magician/actor Rob Zabrecky telling a fictitious history of the film. Sex Madness Revealed premiered at the Overlook Film Festival in April 2018. The film was directed by Tim Kirk and written by Kirk and Patrick Cooper.

Sagging is predominantly a male fashion. Women's wearing of low-rise jeans to reveal their G-string underwear (the \\"whale tail\\") is not generally described as sagging. A person wearing sagging trousers is sometimes called a \\"sagger\\", and in some countries this practice is known as \\"low-riding\\".\\"Low-riding cool dudes told to hitch 'em high\\", Jun 30, 2000, Angela Gregory, NZ Herald\\"Undie- exposed for the beach\\", Jan 1, 2002, Patrick Gower, NZ Herald Origin The style was popularized by skaters and hip-hop artists in the 1990s.\\"Teens' Sagging Jeans Not Just for 'Gangstas.'\\", Jennifer Skordas, Salt Lake Tribune. 15 October 1995 (p. B1). It later became a symbol of freedom and cultural awareness among some youths or a symbol of their rejection of the values of mainstream society. It is often claimed the style originated from the United States prison system where belts are sometimes prohibited and there can be a lack of appropriately sized clothing. Reaction During the 2000s, many North American local governments, school systems, transit agencies, and even airlines passed laws and regulations against the practice of wearing sagging pants, although no state or federal laws have been enacted banning the practice. US presidential candidate Barack Obama, speaking just before the 2008 US Presidential Election, appeared on MTV and said that laws banning the practice of wearing low-slung pants that expose one's underwear were \\"a waste of time ... Having said that, brothers should pull up their pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. What's wrong with that? Come on. Some people might not want to see your underwear. I'm one of them.\\" In June 2007 the Town Council of Delcambre, Louisiana, passed an indecent exposure ordinance, which prohibited intentionally wearing trousers in such a way as to show underwear. In March 2008 the Hahira, Georgia City Council passed a controversial clothing ordinance, in the name of public safety, that bans citizens from wearing pants with top below the waist that reveal skin or undergarments. The council was split 2–2, but the tie was broken by the mayor.

The local chapter of the ACLU threatened legal action in response, saying that sagging did not violate the Flint disorderly conduct ordinance and a Florida judge threw out a case brought under a similar rule, as being unconstitutional.\\"Judge rules saggy pants law unconstitutional/\\", 9/17/2008, NBC Sagging clothing is a violation of some school dress codes,Board Approves Dress Code Changes , Fresno Unified School District, 1993, retrieved 2008-11-23Central Unified School District Dress Code , Central Unified School District, retrieved 2008-11-23Anderson Union High School District Dress Code Guidelines, Anderson Union High School district, 2008-08-20, retrieved 2008-11-23 and the prohibition has been supported in the court system. Two weeks after the \\"Pants on the Ground\\" video became popular thanks to American Idol (see below), a billboard campaign against the style of sagging pants was launched in the Dallas, Texas, area. The billboards feature Big Mama Joseph from the 1997 film Soul Food saying, \\"Pull 'Em Up!\\" and asks youngsters to \\"Keep it a secret!\\" The campaign is the brainchild of Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine R. Caraway, and uses advertising space donated by Clear Channel Outdoor. Another billboard campaign against sagging pants was launched in Brooklyn, New York by New York State Senator Eric Adams on March 28, 2010. In May 2010 New York State Senate President Malcolm Smith used US$2,200 from his campaign fund to launch a similar campaign in Queens. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Japanese snowboarder Kazuhiro Kokubo was barred from participating in the opening ceremonies due to dressing sloppily, including a loosened tie, shirt hanging out, and sagging pants. In the fall of 2010 at Westside Middle School in Memphis, Tennessee, the policy on handling sagging pants is for students to pull them up or get \\"Urkeled\\", a reference to the character Steve Urkel of the 1990s television show Family Matters. In this practice, teachers would pull their pants up and attach them there using zip ties. Students would also have their photo taken and posted on a board in the hallway, for all of their classmates to see. In an interview with WMC-TV, Principal Bobby White stated that the general idea is to fight pop culture with pop culture. One teacher at the school claimed to have \\"Urkeled\\" up to 80 students per week, although after five weeks students got the message, and the number dropped to 18. On November 23, 2010, Albany, Georgia passed a city ordinance that banned the wearing of pants or skirts with top more than three inches below the top of the hips, and imposed a fine of $25 for the first offense, increasing to up to $250 for subsequent offenses. By September 2011, City Attorney Nathan Davis reported that 187 citations had been issued and fines of $3,916 collected. On December 8, 2010, the city of Opa-locka, Florida voted unanimously on a $250 fine or 10 hours of community service for individuals who did not pull their pants up. In Fort Worth, Texas, the local transportation authority implemented a policy in June 2011 that prohibited any passenger from boarding a bus while wearing sagging pants that exposes their underwear or buttocks. Signs were posted on buses saying, \\"Pull 'em up or find another ride\\", and one City Council member was looking for funds for a billboard campaign. The communications manager for the Fort Worth Transportation Authority said that on the first day the policy was enforced, 50 people were removed from buses for wearing improper pants. Some complained about the policy, but the overall response was positive. A state law went into effect in Florida for the 2011–2012 school year banning the practice of sagging while at school. Pupils found in violation receive a verbal warning for the first offense, followed by parental notification by the principal for the second offense, which will require the parent to bring a change of clothing to school. Students would then face in-school suspension for subsequent violations. University of New Mexico football player Deshon Marman was removed from a U.S. Airways flight bound for Albuquerque, New Mexico for wearing sagging pants. A few months later Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong was removed from a Southwest Airlines flight from Oakland to Burbank, California for the same reason. In April 2012 Alabama County Circuit Judge John Bush sentenced 20-year-old LaMarcus Ramsey to three days in jail for appearing in court with sagging blue jeans that exposed his underwear, telling him, \\"You are in contempt of court because you showed your butt in court.\\" On June 12, 2013, the Town Council of Wildwood, New Jersey, located on the Jersey Shore, voted unanimously to ban sagging pants from the town's boardwalk. In Ocala, Florida, a law was passed against sagging jeans, violators face a $500 fine or up to six months in jail. Something similar was done in Wildwood, New Jersey.Demby, Gene. \\"Sagging Pants and the Long Histor of 'Dangerous' Street Fashion.\\" npr.org. 11 Sept. 2014. Web. 11 Apr. 2015.

Opa-locka in Miami-Dade County, Florida, voted 4-1 to repeal their ban on 'saggy pants' in September, 2020. There will be a final vote on the repeal but it is supported by 4 out of 5 commissioners. Music videos Travis Scott sagging his pants while performing in 2015 Sagging has been ridiculed in music videos, first in the 1996 song \\"Back Pockets on the Floor\\" performed by the Green Brothers of Highland Park, Michigan. Another song in 2007 by Dewayne Brown of Dallas, Texas, titled \\"Pull Your Pants Up\\", has a similar message. On January 13, 2010, \\"General\\" Larry Platt performed \\"Pants on the Ground\\" during auditions for the ninth season of American Idol in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2012 a 9-year- old rapper named Amor \\"Lilman\\" Arteaga wrote a song titled \\"Pull Ya Pants Up,\\" and made a music video with an appearance by Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz.

Prior to that, he served as the 3rd Vice President of Liberia from 1854 to 1856 under President Joseph Jenkins Roberts. Although born in the United States, Benson was the first president to have lived in Liberia since childhood, he and his family arriving with the first groups of settlers in 1822. Early life Benson was born in Cambridge, Maryland, United States, to free-born African-American parents.American Colonization Society, \\"The African Repository: The Death Of Ex-President Benson\\" Message from the President of the States, communicating (In compliance with a resolution of the Senate) information relative to the operations of the United States squadron on the west coast of Africa, the condition of the American colonies there, and the commerce of the United States therewith. February 28, 1845., \\"List of Emigrants: Strong\\" In 1822, his family emigrated to the newly established country of Liberia, sailing aboard the Brig Strong.Roll Of Emigrants That Have Been Sent To The Colony Of Liberia Shortly after his arrival in August 1822, the colony was taken over by African natives, holding Benson and his relatives captive for four months. For four years, he was a military shopkeeper. He was also a private secretary to Thomas Buchanan, the last of Liberia's white governors. Benson later became a successful businessman. Benson joined the militia in 1835, and in 1842 became a delegate to the Colonial Council. After Liberia's independence in 1847 he became a judge. He was also a Methodist preacher. Presidency (1856–64) In 1853 Benson became the vice president to Joseph Jenkins Roberts, and after Roberts left office in 1856, Benson succeeded Roberts as President of Liberia. =Foreign relations= Benson obtained diplomatic recognition for Liberia from Belgium in 1858, Denmark in 1860, the United States and Italy in 1862, Norway and Sweden in 1863,Elwood D. Dunn, Amos J. Beyan, Carl Patrick Burrowes. Historical Dictionary of Liberia. p. 38 and Haiti in 1864. =Expansion and relations with indigenous people= In 1857, Benson organised the annexation of the Republic of Maryland. Benson, who knew many indigenous languages, sought collaboration with the native tribes, in contrast to previous Liberian policy, which emphasised American-Liberian superiority and Western customs. Regrettably, this new policy remained largely unimplemented. By 1860, through treaties and purchases with local African leaders, Liberia had extended its boundaries to include a 600-mile (1000 km) coastline. =Finances= Whereas government revenue decreased as a result of the restrictive law, increased military spending to suppress the numerous revolts and wars added to the public deficit. This deteriorated an already precarious financial situation. Consequently, the Liberian Government faced financial bankruptcy on more than one occasion. The overall Liberian economy was also contracting during these years, as palm kernel oil exports to the United States declined. This was due to competition from the whale oil industry and the new mineral oil industry, still in its infancy. Whereas palm kernel oil was once a prized source for lantern light oil, market tastes had changed. This would also prove true of certain coffee exports, as Coffee Arabica would replace blends grown and traded locally as the world markets flavour of choice after this period. Retirement After the end of his presidency Benson retired to his coffee plantation in Grand Bassa County where he died in 1865. Legacy Benson is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, Trachylepis bensonii, which is endemic to Liberia.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Ben Nelson joined soon thereafter as corporate development operations lead, to become CFO and later president. Jasbir Patel was named president and CEO of Snapfish in January 2017. On October 30, 2001, Snapfish was acquired by District Photo for an undisclosed amount. In 2005, Snapfish was bought by Hewlett-Packard. A Merrill Lynch report estimated that HP may have paid between $300 million and $400 million for Snapfish, while Snapfish’s revenue was less than $100 million. Snapfish co-founder Raj Kapoor confirmed in a 2011 interview that the acquisition price was $300 million. In 2004, Snapfish opened a physical retail concept store in Alexandria, Virginia, but later closed it. In August 2013, Snapfish announced on their local websites (and through a mailing to members) that they were shutting down the service in Belgium, India, the Netherlands and Spain. In April 2015, HP reached an agreement to sell Snapfish back to District Photo. Under the terms of the sale, HP allowed the company to continue to use its printing services. During a website conversion in 2016 Snapfish had a data loss while converting to their new web system. Photos prior to January 2014 were unable to be migrated to the new website system. Snapfish said that although some photo albums were recovered, others will remain empty. Typically Snapfish has three versions of images: high resolution, low resolution, and printable images. Both the high resolution and low resolution were lost and the backup files for the printable images were not recoverable. On September 28, 2018 it was announced that Snapfish would acquire CafePress for more than $25 Million. The acquisition of CafePress was completed on November 9, 2018. On June 10, 2019, Apollo Global Management announced that it would acquire both Snapfish and its rival Shutterfly in separate deals valued at around $3 billion in total. The two companies will be merged into a single entity, with Snapfish parent company District Photo as a minority stakeholder. The merger of Shutterfly and Snapfish was completed on January 8, 2020.

A Herzegovinian Serb, his poetry reflecting both the urban culture of the region and the growing national awareness. The most common themes of his poems are social injustice, nostalgic love, suffering of the Serb people, and the unity of the South Slavs. He was the editor-in-chief of the magazine Zora (1896–1901). Šantić was one of the leading persons of Serbian literary and national movement in Mostar.: \\"Aleksa Šantić was one of the leaders of Serbian literary and national movement in Mostar at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century.\\": \\" .... which helped to maintain the national awareness of the Serbs and stimulated their education under foreign occupation. The work of the leaders of the movement – Aleksa Santic, Jovan ...\\" In 1914 Šantić became a member of the Serbian Royal Academy.  Early life  Aleksa Šantić was born into a Herzegovinian Serb family in 1868 in Mostar in the Ottoman Empire. His father Risto was a merchant, and his mother Mara was from notable Aničić family from Mostar. He had three siblings: brothers Jeftan and Jakov and sister Radojka known as Persa; another sister Zorica died in infancy. The family did not have much patience for Aleksa's lyrical talents. Just as Aleksa turned 10 years of age, Bosnia Vilayet (including Mostar) was occupied by Austria-Hungary as per decision made by European Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin during summer of 1878. Aleksa's father Risto died, which is when his brother Miho known as Adža (Aleksa's uncle) got custody of Aleksa and his siblings. In 1880 and 1881 Šantić attended a Merchant school in Trieste in Italian language. While studying in Trieste Šantić lived with his uncles Lazar and Todor Aničić who were merchants in Trieste. In 1881 Šantić became a student of a merchant school in Ljubljana (Marova Akademija) where lectures were given in German.: \\"U Ljubljani .... Inače, Marova akademija u Ljubljani, osnovana 1867. godine kao pansionat za sinove imućnih građana, po nastavnom programu je bila slična trgovačkoj akademiji, naravno u skraćenom obimu. Ovaj privatni i komercijalni vaspitni zavod, u kome su učenici živjeli pod stalnim i strogim nadzorom pedagoga, imao ...\\" In 1883 he returned to Mostar with knowledge of Italian and German languages.: \\"Santic was educated abroad, in Trieste and in Ljubljana, but he was not happy in the \\"West,\\" and by 1883 he had returned to the town of his birth, albeit with a knowledge of German and Italian and a ..\\"  Serb cultural movement  Together with Svetozar Ćorović and Jovan Dučić, Šantić was a follower of romanticism of Vojislav Ilić and among most important leaders of cultural and national movement of Herzegovina Serbs.: \\"Из песничке школе Војислава Илића поникао је и Алекса Шантић (1868–1924), који је, заједно са Јова- ном Дучићем и Светозаром Ћоровићем, био међу глав- ним носиоцима културног и националног покрета хер- цеговачких Срба, ....\\" Šantić and Ćorović intended to establish a journal for Serb children called \\"Херцеговче\\" (), not only for Serb children from Herzegovina, but for all Serb children.: \\"У заплнјеи.еном тексту изричито пише да се лист \\"Херцеговче\\" неће везати \\"ни за који становити српски крај: \\"он ће се штампати и удешавати за сву српску децу из свијех српскијех крајева и покрајина\\"\\" Šantić was one of the notable members of the Serb cultural society Prosvjeta. The hymn of the society was authored by Šantić.: \\"Химну друштва спевао је Алекса Шантић...\\" Šantić presided over the Serbian Singing Society \\"Gusle\\" established in 1888.: \\"Santić je sada predsjednik Srpskog pjevačkog društva \\"Gusle\\".\\" In this society Šantić was not only its president but also a lead singer of its chorus, composer and lecturer.: \\"Aleksa Šantić je bio svestrano aktivan u društvu \\"Gusle\\": kao predsednik, horovođa, pevač, daroviti kompozitor, predavač i predstavljač, mnogo cenjen i voljen.\\" The literature magazin \\"Zora\\" was published under patronage of \\"Gusle\\". Šantić became the editor-in-chief of this magazine review \\"Zora\\" (Dawn; 1896–1901) published by Serbian Cultural Society in Mostar which was among the most important societies which struggled for preservation of Serb cultural autonomy and national rights.: \\" in 1902, their first important cultural- national society Prosvjeta (Education) , of greater significance in preserving the national identity. It was to merge with another Serbian cultural society called Zora (Dawn) in Mostar, the chief agency in the struggle for the cultural autonomy and national rights.\\" \\"Zora\\" became one of the best Serbian literature magazines.: \\"Захваљујући упорности тро- јице младића и њихових помагача (Атанасија Шоле, Јована Протића, Стевана Жакуле, Милана Ћуковића), Зора је постала један од најбољих српских књижев- них листова. \\" The journal Zora gathered members of the Serbian intelligentsia who strived to improve education of Serbian population necessary to reach economic and political progress.: \\"...and the Serbian intelligentsia gathered around the journal Zora were striving to improve education among the Serb population in order to achieve economic and political progress. In 1903 Šantić was among the founders of the Serbian Gymnastics Society \\"Obilić\\". In this capacity he came into focus of the life of this region which, by its cultural and national consciousness, showed a stubborn opposition to the German Kulturträger. In the spring of 1909, because of the Bosnian crisis caused by the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, Šantić had to escape to Italy together with Nikola Kašiković and Ćorović. In 1910 the Šantić family bought a country house in the village Borci, near Konjic from Austro- Hungarian baron Benko who built it in 1902. The product of his patriotic inspiration during the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 is the book \\"Na starim ognjištima\\" (On the Old Hearths; 1913). Šantić belonged to poets who wrote whole collections of songs glorifying victories of Army of Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars, including On the coast of Drač () which glorifies liberation of the ancient city that once was part of the Serbian Kingdom under King Milutin.: \\"Алекса Шантић и други објавили су читаве збирке стихова у славу српских победа. ...\\" On 3 February 1914 Šantić became a member of the Serbial Royal Academy (precedent of the modern Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts). During World War I he was taken by the Austrians as hostage, but he survived the war. Šantić moved from Mostar to Borci near Konjic in 1914 when suspicious urban Serb population of Mostar was evacuated from the town. On 13 November 1914 Austrian governor in Sarajevo banned Šantić's collection of poems \\"Pjesme\\" published in 1911. Šantić was a prolific poet and writer. He wrote almost 800 poems, seven theatrical plays and some prose. Many of the writings were of high quality and aimed to criticize the Establishment or advocate diverse social and cultural issues. He was strongly influenced by Heinrich Heine, whose works he translated. His friends and peers in the field of culture were Svetozar Ćorović, Jovan Dučić and Milan Rakić. One of his sisters, Radojka (Persa) married Svetozar Ćorović. The literature historian and critic Eugen Štampar believed that Šantić belonged to group of Serb poets who tried to attract Bosnian Muslims toward Serbian nationalism.: \\"Dok su Milorad Popović-Šapčanin, Svetozar Ćorović, Aleksa Šantić, a poslije i Petar Kočić nastojali da bosanske muslimane orijentiraju prema srpskom nacionalizmu....\\" Works Šantić among prominent writers Šantić worked as merchant for his father and read a lot of books before he decided to write poetry and met another young merchant, Jovan Dučić from Trebinje who published his first poem in 1886 in the youth literature magazine Pidgeon () in Sombor (modern-day Serbia). Following example of his friend Jovan Dučić, Šantić also published his first song in literature magazine Pidgeon, its 1887 New Year's Eve edition. The first poems Šantić published were inspired by older Serbian poets like Njegoš, Zmaj, Vojislav Ilić and Jakšić.: \\"His first poems were imitative of the older Serbian poets: Njegos, Zmaj, JakSic, and Ilic.\\" The first collection of Šantićs songs was published in Mostar in 1891. He awarded all income from its sales to erecting the monument of Sima Milutinović Sarajlija. In 1901 Bogdan Popović wrote negative critics of Šantić's poetry. Popović's critics had positive and stimulative effect on young Šantić and the quality of his future works. The oeuvre of Aleksa Šantić, widely accessible yet acutely personal, is a blend of fine-tuned emotional sensibility and clear-eyed historical awareness, steeped in the specifics of local culture. He worked at the crossroads of two centuries and more than other poets of his generation, combined theoretical and poetic suffering nineteenth and twentieth centuries. At the same time, Šantić writes about his personal troubles – the loss of close and dear people (his mother, brothers Jeftan and Jakov, and brother-in-law Svetozar Ćorović), the health that was a lifetime problem and loneliness that accompanied him to the end. Drawing themes and imagery from his hometown Mostar, the atmospheric capital of Mediterranean Herzegovina, and its surroundings, his poetry is marked in equal part by the late-Ottoman urban culture in the region, its social distinctions, subdued passions and melancholy, as well as the South Slavic national awareness.Mostar – Cjelokupna Djela . Aleksa Santic (24 June 2001); retrieved 29 July 2014. As a Serb who embraced the form and the sentiment of the traditional Bosnian love ballad sevdalinka, developed under a strong influence of Muslim love songs, he was a pioneer in attempting to bridge the national and cultural divides, and in his lamentation of the erosion of population through emigration, that was the result of Austrian-Hungarian occupation. Work on the translation of poems by Svatopluk Čech, tiring and exhausting, coincided with his first serious health problems, but the rebellious lyrics of this Czech poet, sung against the Austrian occupation, gave Šantić the strength to persevere: every verse of Svatopluk Čech, that he converted into a harmonious rhyme in our language, expressed his thoughts and his feelings. This combination of locally rooted, transcultural sensibility and a dedicated pan-Slavic vision has earned him a special place in the pantheon of Serbian poetry. Šantić agreed with the idea that the Ekavian pronunciation of Serbo-Croatian should be adopted by a unified literature of Serbs and Croats, although Šantić himself wrote in his native Ijekavian pronunciation of the language. Statue of Aleksa Šantić in Mostar He was influenced mostly by the poets Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, Vojislav Ilić and Heinrich Heine, whom he was translating. He is said to have reached his greatest poetic maturity between 1905 and 1910, when he wrote his best songs.A bilingual edition of the best verses of Aleksa Santic . Lukapraha.cz (28 October 2011); retrieved 29 July 2014. Šantić's poetry is full of emotion, sadness and pain of love and defiance of social and national disempowered people whom he himself belonged. His muse is at the crossroads of love and patriotism, beloved ideal, and suffering people. The topics and images of his poems ranged from strong emotions for social injustices of his time to nostalgic love. His poems about Mostar and the Neretva river are particularly praised. Šantić wrote a number of love songs in the style of the Bosnian love songs, sevdalinkas. His most well known poem-turned-sevdalinka is Emina, to which music was composed and it is often sung at restaurants (kafanas). The ambiance of his love poems include the neighborhood gardens, flowers, baths, fountains, and girls who appear in them are decorated with a necklace, the challenging but the hidden beauty. This is right about the song \\"Emina\\". The spirit of this song is so striking that it became the nation's favorite and sings as sevdalinka. In love songs the most common motive is the desire. The poet watches his beloved from afar and longing often turns into sadness because of unrequited love and the failure of life. His patriotic poetry is poetry about his motherland and her citizens (\\"My homeland\\"). In some of his most moving poems Šantić sings about the suffering of those who leave the country forever and go into an unknown and alien world (\\"Stay here\\", \\"Bread\\"). Šantić emphasizes suffering and martyrdom as the most important moments in the historical destiny of the people (\\"We know destiny\\").Aleksa Šantić – poznati bosanski pjesnik. Santic.org; retrieved 29 July 2014. During his life he wrote six volumes of poetry (1891, 1895, 1900, 1908, 1911, 1913), as well as some dramatizations in verse, the best of which are Pod maglom (In the Fog; 1907) and Hasan-Aginica (1911). He also translated Heine's Lyrisches Intermezzo (1897–1898), prepared an anthology of translated German poets, Iz nemacke lirike (From German Lyrics; 1910), made Bosnian renderings of Schiller's Wilhelm Tell (1922) and translated Pjesme roba (Poems of a Slave; 1919) from the Czech writer Svatopluk Čech. He also translated successfully from German. Šantić was one of the founders of the cultural newspaper \\"Dawn\\" as the president of the Serbian Singing Society \\"Gusle\\". There he met and socialized with famous poets of that era: Svetozar Ćorović, Jovan Dučić, Osman Đikić, Milan Rakić. Šantić died on 2 February 1924 in his hometown of tuberculosis, then an incurable disease. The funeral was attended by all the citizens of Mostar irrespective of their religious affiliation. Legacy Aleksa Šantić is a village in Serbia named after this poet. He is also pictured on 10 Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible marks bill. In 1920 Sokol Union in Mostar was named after Šantić. In 1969 the Assembly of the Mostar municipality established the Literature Award \\"Aleksa Šantić\\" in honor of centinel of his birth. A bust of Aleksa Šantić is erected in Kalemegdan Park in Belgrade, Serbia.: Јер, Шантић је знао боље но ико шта је Дучић значио и за онај град на Неретви и за онај на Сави, на чијем Калемегдану Алексина биста стоји сада усправно, али усамљено, уозбиљено. In the 1980s a movie called Moj brat Aleksa (My Brother Aleksa) was produced in his memory.

It is endemic to Western Australia, commonly occurring in the south west of the State from north of Geraldton south to Kojonup. It is very common on road verges and in disturbed areas of Perth. Description Common woollybush grows as a tall shrub up to three metres high. It has soft grey-green or grey-blue foliage, consisting of closely packed, small, hairy leaves on pliable, hairy stems. It is woolly both in appearance and feel, hence the common name. The leaves have nectaries at the tips; these attract ants, which play a role in distribution of seed. The nectar filled cups are taken by the ants to their nests to be consumed, the seeds becoming inaccessible to birds, etc. Like most other Adenanthos species, but unusually for Proteaceae, the flowers of common woollybush are not large and showy, but are rather small, dull, and hidden within the foliage. The stems of the plant are bored into by moths, leaving their eggs there; the larvae are in turn used by female wasps for their own eggs. Taxonomy A species of Adenanthos, a genus that is mostly restricted to the Southwest botanical province. Adenanthos cygnorum was first collected by the English botanist and plant-collector Allan Cunningham in 1818 at the Swan River, Western Australia. The specific name cygnorum, from the Latin cygnus meaning swan, refers to the type locality. There are two subspecies: Adenanthos cygnorum subsp. cygnorum and Adenanthos cygnorum subsp. chamaephyton. The latter is a prostrate, mat-forming shrub; it is rare and poorly known, and some populations are under threat, but is not currently considered endangered. Ecology The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) has been observed feeding at the flowers of A. cygnorum. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.

The airport is located in the area of Qasr bin Ghashir, from central Tripoli. It used to be the hub for Libyan Airlines, Afriqiyah Airways, and Buraq Air. The airport has been closed intermittently since 2011 and as of early 2018, flights to and from Tripoli have been using Mitiga International Airport instead. As part of the 2014 Libyan Civil War, the airport was heavily damaged in the Battle of Tripoli Airport. The airport reopened for limited commercial use in July 2017. In April 2019, however, it was reported that Mitiga had become the last functioning airport in Tripoli during the 2019–20 Western Libya campaign. It was soon acknowledged that the ruling Government of National Accord (GNA) had bombed the airport in order to recapture it from the Libyan National Army (LNA). Mitiga was soon shut down as well after being bombed by the LNA, thus making the Misrata Airport, located approximately 200 km (125 miles) to the east down the coast, the nearest airport for Tripoli residents. History The airport was originally called Tripoli-Castel Benito Airport and was a Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) airfield built in 1934 in the southern outskirts of Italian Tripoli. In 1938 the governor of Italian Libya, Italo Balbo, enlarged the military airfield to create an international airport for civilians served by Ala Littoria, the official Italian airline: the Aeroporto di Tripoli-Castel Benito. The first international flights were to Rome, Tunis, and Malta. In 1939, a flight from Rome to Ethiopia and Somalia was one of the first intercontinental flights. During World War II the airport was destroyed, but the airfield was later used by the British Royal Air Force and named RAF Castel Benito, changing to RAF Idris in 1952. In the 1950s and 1960s the airport was known as Tripoli Idris International Airport.Tripoli Idris Airport . Retrieved 15 December 2007.Tripoli Idris International Airport .

The existing international terminal was designed and built from a masterplan developed by Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners. The airport closed from March 2011 to October 2011 as a result of the United Nations Security Council establishing a no-fly zone over Libya. The Zintan Brigade captured the airport during their advance on Tripoli on 21 August 2011. The airport was officially reopened on 11 October 2011. On 14 July 2014, the airport was the site of fierce battle as militias from the city of Misrata attempted to take control of the airport. The airport has been closed to flights since the clashes.New rocket attack on Tripoli airport BBC News. 15 July 2014.90% of aircraft destroyed at Tripoli airport, Libya may seek international assistance RT. 15 July 2014. On 23 August 2014, after 40 days of clashes, Zintan forces, which controlled the airport, withdrew. The Los Angeles Times reported that at least 90% of the airport's facilities and 20 airplanes were destroyed in the fighting. While still under the control of Misrata militias, the VIP terminal, which had not been not as badly damaged, was reopened on 16 February 2017. A new passenger terminal is in planning by the political body representing the militias. In April 2019, the airport was captured by forces loyal to the Libyan National Army (LNA) and its leader Khalifa Haftar and was held for over a year, despite the control of the airport swaying back to GNA briefly on May 2019. Due to its location at the southern border of the Tripoli Metropolitan Area, it served as a part of the larger suburban stronghold of Qasr bin Ghashir village south of Tripoli City, used as a staging ground in attacks attempting to capture or weaken GNA's hold of the capital. As a result of ongoing clashes, it was acknowledged that the open terrain was subject to retaliatory and preliminary bombing by GNA from Tripoli frontier, making it unusable as an airport. Eventually, the Airport, alongside the village of Qasr bin Ghashir was decisively captured by GNA as a part of its 2020 offensive to push back LNA and end the siege of the capital city, on June 2020. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/libya-gna-aligned- forces-announce-takeover-tripoli-airport-200603185635776.html Its capture signified GNA regaining control of the entire Tripoli city and its metropolitan area.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCrwh6P-KD4 Facilities The airport's existing terminals and runways in a satellite image =Terminals= The airport had one main passenger terminal that served international and domestic departures and arrivals.

Beside this was a prayer room and a first-class lounge which served business class and above on almost all airlines operating from the airport. Seen on google maps, the entire passenger terminal is completely demolished, however the jet ways can still be seen sitting in the position relative to their formal gates. The airport operated 24 hours a day. There was no overnight accommodation at the airport but there were plans to build an airport hotel to serve transit flyers.

Kafana (in Bosnian, Montenegrin and Serbian ), kafene\\\\kafeneja (in Albanian), kafeana (кафеана, in Macedonian), kavana (in Croatian, ), kavarna (in Slovene) are terms used in most former Yugoslav countries and Albania for a distinct type of local bistro which primarily serves alcoholic beverages and coffee, and often also light snacks (meze) and other food. Most kafanas feature live music performances. The concept of a social gathering place for men to drink alcoholic beverages and coffee originated in Ottoman Empire and spread to Southeast Europe during Ottoman rule, further evolving into the contemporary kafana. Nomenclature and etymology This distinct type of establishment is known by several slightly differing names depending on country and language: * Serbian (Cyrillic): кафана (kafana), pl. кафане (kafane) *Bosnian: kafana pl. kafane *Croatian: kavana, pl. kavane * Macedonian: кафеана (kafeana), pl. кафеани (kafeani) * Albanian: kafeneja\\\\Kafenë pl. kafenejet\\\\Kafenët * Greek: καφενείο (kafenio), pl. καφενεία(kafenia) * Romanian: cafenea, pl. cafenele The word itself, irrespective of regional differences, is derived from the Turkish kahvehane (\\"coffeehouse\\") which is in turn derived from the Persian term qahveh-khaneh (a compound of the Arabic qahve [coffee] and Persian khane [house]). In Macedonia, kafeana is sometimes confused with the more traditional meana, while the variant kafana (adopted from commercial Serbian folk-songs and popularized by domestic artists) may be used for the establishment described in this article; however, both terms are used interchangeably by some. Nowadays in Serbia, the term kafana is similarly used to describe any informal eatery serving traditional cuisine, as well as some other classical kafana dishes like karađorđeva. History Kafana at palace Albania, Belgrade, 1910s. In the days of 18th and early 19th century, running a kafana (then usually called mehana) was a family business, a craft, passed on from generation to generation. As the Balkan cities grew in size and became more urbanized, kafana also shifted its focus a bit. Some started serving food and offering other enticements to potential customers since owners now had to compete with other similar establishments around the city. Most bigger towns and cities in this period had a Gradska kafana (City kafana) located in or around main square where the most affluent and important individuals of that city would come to see and be seen. Prices in this particular kafana would usually be higher compared to others around the city that didn't enjoy the privilege of such an exclusive location. The concept of live music was introduced in the early 20th century by kafana owners looking to offer different kinds of entertainment to their guests. Naturally, in the absence of mass media these bands strictly had a local character and would only play folk music that was popular within a particular region where the city lies. As the 20th century rolled on, Balkan cities saw waves upon waves of rural population coming in, especially after World War II, and kafane diversified accordingly. Some continued to uphold a higher standard of service, while others began to cater to newly arrived rural population that mostly found employment in factories and on construction sites. This is when the term kafana slowly began to be associated with something undesirable and suitable only for lower classes of society. By the 1980s, term kafana became almost an insult and most owners would steer clear of calling their places by that name, preferring westernized terms like restaurant, cafe, bistro, coffee bar, and so on, instead. On the other hand, terms birtija, bircuz and krčma are also used to denote, usually rural or suburban, filthy kafane.  The stereotype  It is not quite clear when the term kafana became instantly synonymous with decay, sloth, pain, backwardness, sorrow, etc. all across SFR Yugoslavia, but it is safe to say it happened in the 1970s or 1980s. Pop culture played a significant part in this transformation. Massively popular folk singers began to emerge, spurred on by the expansion of radio and television, often using kafana themes in their songs. Since the connection between commercial folk and rural regressiveness was already well established, kafana, too, got a dodgy rap by extension. During the 1960s, in contrast to the state-sponsored Partisan films, Yugoslav movies of the Black Wave movement started depicting contemporary individuals from the margins of society. Run-down kafane would feature prominently in such stories. Socially relevant films like I Even Met Happy Gypsies, When Father Was Away on Business, Život je lep, Do You Remember Dolly Bell?, Specijalno vaspitanje, Kuduz, etc. all had memorable, dramatic scenes that take place in dilapidated rural or suburban kafana. Soon, a distinct cinematic stereotype appeared. In Mate Bulić's album Gori borovina, there is a song \\"Ej, kavano\\", which describes the common stereotype of the kafana. = Social stereotype = Kafana is stereotyped as a place where sad lovers cure their sorrows in alcohol and music, gamblers squander entire fortunes, husbands run away from mean wives while shady businessmen, corrupt local politicians and petty criminals do business. As in many other societies, frequenting kafane is seen as a mainly male activity, and \\"honest\\" women dare only visit finer ones, usually in the company of men. As mentioned, it is a very frequent motif of late-20th century commercial folk songs, perhaps the most famous being \\"I tebe sam sit kafano\\" (I'm Already Sick of You, Kafana) by Haris Džinović, \\"Kafana je moja sudbina\\" (Kafana is My Destiny) by Toma Zdravković, and the ubiquitous \\"Čaše lomim\\" (I'm Breaking Glasses), originally by Nezir Eminovski.  By country  = Bosnia and Herzegovina = Probably the purest form of kafana can be found in Bosnia where no food is served (differentiating kafana from ćevabdžinica, aščinica and buregdžinica), staying true to the original Turkish coffee and alcohol concept. In Bosnian cities with large Muslim populations, one can still find certain old kafane that probably didn't look much different back when the Ottomans ruled Bosnia. They are now mostly frequented by local elders as well as the occasional tourist, and their numbers are dwindling. Most of the old centerpiece Gradske Kafane have been visually modernized and had their names changed in the process to something snappy and western-sounding. Most other establishments that offer similar fare target a younger crowd and prefer not to use the term kafana. However, stereotypical kafanas hold some popularity amongst high-schoolers and students, as well as working-class men, who frequent them as places to binge drink due to their affordable prices. = Serbia = kafana \\"?\\" in downtown Belgrade City of Belgrade features many establishments equipped with extensive kitchens serving elaborate menus that are officially called restaurants yet most patrons refer to them as kafane. According to some, the first kafana in Belgrade opened sometime after 1738, when the Ottomans recaptured the city from the Austrians. Its name was Crni orao (Black Eagle) and it was located in Dorćol neighbourhood, at the intersection of today's Kralja Petra and Dušanova streets. Its patrons were only served Turkish black coffee poured from silver ibrik into a fildžan as well as nargile.Pohvala razvoju beogradske kafe-kulture: kafana;Politika, 10 July 2008 The concept of eating in Serbian kafane was introduced in the 19th century when the menu consisted mostly of simply snacks, such as ćevapčići. The menus soon expanded as food became large part of the appeal of Belgrade kafane that originated in the 19th and early 20th century like the famous ? (Question Mark), Lipov lad (The Linden Tree's Shade, opened in 1928), and Tri lista duvana (Three Tobacco Leaves), as well as Skadarlija bohemian spots Tri šešira (Three Hats), Dva bela goluba (Two Doves), Šešir moj (This Hat of Mine), Dva jelena (Two Deer), Zlatni bokal (The Golden Jug), and Ima dana (There's Time). Another kafana that gained notoriety during the early 20th century was Zlatna moruna (The Golden Beluga) at the Zeleni Venac neighbourhood where Young Bosnia conspirators frequently gathered while plotting the June 1914 assassination of Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand. Certain kafane had their names preserved through the structures that succeeded them in the same location; Palace Albanija, built in 1940 in central Belgrade got its name from the kafana that used to be there from 1860 until 1936. Post World War II period gave a rise in popularity to kafane like Šumatovac, Pod lipom (Under the Lime Tree), and Grmeč in Makedonska Street (nicknamed the 'Bermuda triangle'),Film o beogradskom \\"Bermudskom trouglu\\"; MTS Mondo, 15 February 2007 Manjež, as well as later establishments like Madera, Kod Ive (Ivo's), and Klub književnika (the Writers' Club). Even the traditionally upscale restaurant joints like Ruski car (Russian Tsar) and Grčka Kraljica (Greek Queen) weren't above being referred to as kafana. Things have somewhat changed, however, since approximately the 1970s with the influx of Western pop and media cultures taking root. Most of the younger Serbian crowd started to associate the term kafana with something archaic and passé so the owners of places that cater to them began avoiding it altogether. Terms such as \\"kafić\\", initially and later \\"kafe\\" began to be used more frequently. An example would be Zlatni papagaj (Golden Parrot) in Belgrade, a kafić that opened in September 1979 and almost immediately became the main gathering point for the city's well-dressed youngsters from affluent families.Pohvala razvoju beogradske kafe-kulture: kafić;Politika, 22 July 2008 Similarly in the mid-1980s, kafić called Nana in Senjak neighbourhood became a favourite tough guy and mobster hangout. The trend of moving away from the term kafana continued into the 1990s, and early 2000s. With gentrification taking root in many parts of central Belgrade, these new establishments mostly stay away from traditionalism. Good examples of this would be the numerous watering holes that have sprung up over the last 15 years in Strahinjića Bana Street, such as Veprov dah, Ipanema, Kandahar, and Dorian Gray, or various new restaurants in downtown Belgrade - none of these places are referred to as kafane, either by their owners or by their patrons. =Croatia= In Croatia, the term for kafana is kavana (as coffee is spelled kava in Croatian) and they differ widely between continental Croatia and the Dalmatian coast. Kafić (pl. kafići) is a more general term encompassing all establishments serving coffee and alcohol drinks only, while kavana is the name for distinctly styled bistros described in this article. =Macedonia= Currently, there are 5,206 kafeani in the country. According to the State Statistical Office, there are 989 kafeani (19% of the total number) in the capital Skopje, 413 in Tetovo, 257 in Bitola, 244 in Gostivar, 206 in Kumanovo, 205 in Struga, 188 in Ohrid and 161 in Strumica.Dnevnik newspaper (Macedonia) =Albania= Cafes along Mustafa Matohiti St near Blloku district in central Tirana In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffee houses per capita in the world.http://www.ocnal.com/2018/02/albania-ranked-first-in-world-for.html In fact, there are 654 coffee houses per 100,000 inhabitants in Albania, a country with only 2.5 million inhabitants. This is due to coffee houses closing down in Spain due to the economic crisis, and the fact that as many cafes open as they close in Albania. In addition, the fact that it was one of the easiest ways to make a living after the fall of communism in Albania, together with the country's Ottoman legacy further reinforce the strong dominance of coffee culture in Albania.

Microsoft offered mainstream support for Windows Mobile 5 through October 12, 2010, and extended support through October 13, 2015. It was first offered on the Dell Axim x51. It used the .NET Compact Framework 1.0 SP3, an environment for programs based on .NET. Windows Mobile 5.0 included Microsoft Exchange Server \\"push\\" functionality improvements that worked with Exchange 2003 SP2. The \\"push\\" functionality also required vendor/device support With AKU2 software upgrades all WM 5.0 devices supported DirectPush. This version featured increased battery life due to Persistent storage capability. Previously up to 50% (enough for 72 hours of storage) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM. This continued the trend of Windows-based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of RAM and flash memory (in use, no distinction between the two is obvious to users). Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM, while most storage is in the flash memory. The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed. Everything is backed up in the flash memory, so unlike prior devices, WM5 devices lose no data if power is lost. New to 5.0, OS updates were released as Adaptation kit upgrades, with AKU 3.5 being the final released. A new version of Office was bundled called \\"Microsoft Office Mobile\\" which includes PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile with graphing capability and Word Mobile with the ability to insert tables and graphics. Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support, default QWERTY keyboard-support and a management interface for Global Positioning System (GPS). Improvements were made to ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed.

Perkins was an iconic figure in what would become known as rockabilly music. His creatively simple, sparsely embellished, rhythmic use of Fender Esquire, Jazzmaster and Jaguar guitars is credited for creating Cash's signature \\"boom-chicka-boom\\" style. Early life and musical beginnings Perkins was born in Como, Mississippi, the son of a Baptist preacher. He grew up in Como, and taught himself to play rhythm guitar. Perkins started his career in 1953 as a mechanic at Automobile Sales Company in Memphis. He specialized in electrical systems and radio repairs. Roy Cash, Sr., older brother of Johnny Cash, was service manager at the dealership. At the time, the younger Cash was stationed in Germany with the US Air Force. At Automobile Sales, Perkins met co-workers Marshall Grant and A.W. 'Red' Kernodle. Grant, Kernodle and Perkins began bringing their guitars to work, and would play together when repair business was slow. When Johnny Cash moved to Memphis after returning from Germany in 1954, Roy Cash introduced him to Grant, Kernodle and Perkins. The four began to get together in the evenings at Perkins' or Grant's home and play songs. It was during this time that they decided to form a band, with Grant acquiring a string bass, Kernodle a six- string steel guitar, and Perkins buying a somewhat-abused Fender Esquire electric guitar from the O.K. Houck Piano Co. in Memphis. The guitar had been modified by a previous owner, and the volume and tone controls did not work. \\"Boom-chicka-boom\\" style Since he could not control the volume of the single-pickup instrument, Perkins began the practice of muting the three bass strings (E, A and D) with the heel of his right hand, much in the style of Merle Travis, and scratching a rhythm pattern (as heard on Sun Records recordings prior to 1958). This pattern developed into a more defined, varying 1/8-8/5/8-8 picking (with random syncopation) on later Sun recordings and for the rest of Perkins’ career. In late 1954, when Cash got an audition with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records, he brought Perkins, Grant and Kernodle along to back him instrumentally. The experience made Kernodle nervous, and he ended up leaving before the session was over, with Perkins and Grant providing the instrumentation. Perkins, as a member of the Tennessee Two (later, the Tennessee Three, with the addition of drummer W.S. \\"Fluke\\" Holland), toured with Cash and appeared on most of his recordings. He was well known for his laconic, focused demeanor on stage. He was often the target of jokes by Cash, who would make comments such as \\"Luther's been dead for years, but he just doesn't know it\\". Perkins was Cash's lead guitarist on many of the popular Town Hall Party television appearances in the 1950s, often interacting with one another for stage effect and providing the signature \\"boom-chick-a-boom\\" background sound that came to define a large part of Johnny Cash's sound.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUdTcP-fs9g In his 1997 memoir Cash, the singer recalled, \\"Keith Richards came to one of our British shows, at a U.S. military base in the early '60s, but he wasn't interested in me; Luther was the one he couldn't wait to watch.\\" Personal life Perkins was married twice. He and his first wife, Bertie, separated while they were living in Southern California in 1959. Perkins had three daughters: Linda, Vickie, and Claudia. He later married Margie Higgins; Margie Higgins' niece Kathy lived with them. Margie Perkins Beaver still appears at Johnny Cash reunion events. His hobbies were knitting, fishing and guitar. He was a close friend of singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson. At the time of his death, he was planning to open his own music publishing company and give Kristofferson his first break. Perkins’ younger brother, Thomas, was a successful rock ‘n’ roll singer in the 1950s and 1960s, under the name of Thomas Wayne. In his autobiography, Johnny Cash wrote that Perkins was mildly addicted to amphetamines. They started taking drugs together in the late 1950s. Perkins' nickname was \\"L.M\\", the initials of his first and second name \\"Luther Monroe\\". Singer-guitarist Carl Perkins, who was also a member of Cash's touring show, was not related to Luther Perkins. Death During the early morning hours of August 3, 1968, Perkins returned from fishing on Old Hickory Lake to his newly constructed home on Riverwood Drive, Hendersonville, Tennessee. He apparently went to sleep in the living room while holding a lit cigarette. His niece by marriage awoke around 6:00 am to find the living room aflame and Perkins collapsed near the door, almost dead. An emergency crew rushed Perkins to Vanderbilt University Hospital, where he was kept under intensive care until he died two days later. He is buried near the graves of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash at Hendersonville Memorial Park in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Luther Perkins was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, as inductee #0230. In 1980, Perkins's daughters from his first marriage filed suit against Johnny Cash for embezzling funds that were to have provided retirement income for Perkins. This lawsuit was filed coincidentally with actions taken by the other founding Tennessee Three member, Marshall Grant, against Cash for wrongfully firing Grant and embezzlement of Grant's retirement funds. Both lawsuits were eventually settled out-of-court. Walk the Line In Walk The Line, the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash, Perkins is portrayed by Dan John Miller. Perkins's future death is alluded to in the film in a bus scene where Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) walks past a sleeping Perkins. Perkins is depicted as asleep with his cigarette still burning in his mouth. Cash stubs it out in the ashtray in front of him which foreshadows Perkins's eventual death.

This includes the removal of scenes or dialogue, replacement of audio and/or visual elements, and adding material from sources such as deleted scenes or even other films. In their most common form, fan edits resemble the work done by professional editors when creating a director's or extended cut of a film, although fan edits are usually limited by the footage already made available to the public with the official home video release of a film, while professional editors working for a film studio have access to more and higher quality footage and elements. In addition to re-editing films, some fan edits feature basic corrections, such as colors or framing, that maintain or restore consistency within the film, such as the Star Wars fan-restoration Harmy's Despecialized Edition, which aims at restoring the Star Wars Original Trilogy to its original, pre-Special Edition form. Other types of fan edits, such as Cosmogony, Bateman Begins: An American Psycho and Memories Alone, merge footage from various films into an entirely different production.< While many fan edits are viewed as reactionary to perceived weaknesses in the original films, one film scholar at the University of Kansas has argued that such edits allow fans to creatively reimagine films instead of merely attempting to fix such works. Fan edits are made for non-commercial purposes and as such could be considered a case of fair use, but their legality is unclear. History Before the term \\"fan edit\\" was coined, many alternate versions of films edited by other fans or professional editors were simply known as a \\"cut.\\" In the late 1970s, many alternate \\"cuts\\" of films were released in the United States, and foreign films (such as those from Europe or Japan) deemed unsuitable for American audiences underwent further alterations, score changes and re-titlings. The first fan edit to popularize the field was The Phantom Edit, created in 2000 by professional editor Mike J. Nichols under the pseudonym of the \\"Phantom Editor\\". Nichols removed elements from George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace that he felt detracted from the film, and made minor changes in dialogue, languages and subtitles to give the film's villains a more menacing tone. The end result was distributed on VHS and later online, and received attention by the media for its attempt to improve upon the original film. The Phantom Edit was the first of many Star Wars fan edits to come, and has since inspired dozens of edits to surface on the internet. The second major edit was done with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, originally a film that Stanley Kubrick was involved with, that Steven Spielberg ended up directing after Kubrick's death. In 2002, an independent filmmaker named DJ Hupp introduced his take on the film named \\"The Kubrick Edit\\", omitting certain scenes to alter the tone, to be closer to Kubrick's style. The following year, the Purist Edit changed The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers to more closely follow J. R. R. Tolkien's books. After that the trend started to gain popularity and spread to other films in the same fashion, such as The Matrix series, Pearl Harbor, Dune, Superman II, and others. Editor Adywan (Adrian Sayce) made a complete overhaul of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back in 2009 and 2017 respectively, under the title Star Wars - Revisited, featuring continuity fixes, image and cropping corrections, score restoration, new matter, rotoscoping work and new CGI elements to remove several additions from the various Special Editions of the films from 1997 onward. In 2008, a similar overhaul was made by editor Uncanny Antman (Sean O'Sullivan) to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which changed the film's tone to be more in line with the first two films and fixed various continuity contradictions to the previous films and image & cropping errors; the film was rereleased under the title of Terminator: The Coming Storm. Professional filmmaker Steven Soderbergh has created fan edits of Psycho and its remake, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Heaven's Gate and 2001: A Space Odyssey that he has posted on his website. Independent filmmaker Peet Gelderblom made a fan edit of Brian De Palma's Raising Cain, which attempted to reorder the film the way it was originally scripted. De Palma came across the fan edit and was so impressed with it, he had Gelderblom supervise a high definition version of it for Blu-ray, which was released under the Director's Cut label, as De Palma felt that the edit has \\"restored the true story of Raising Cain\\". Members of Fanedit.org have condensed seasons of Game of Thrones into feature-length films. CleanFlicks was a Utah-based video store that offered more than 700 movies that had been remixed to appeal to Utah's religious family audience. The chain of stores spread across 18 states in 70 different locations before a federal court judge ruled their remixes illegal in 2006. In 2017 French editors Lucas Stoll and Gaylor Morestin created a fan edit of Breaking Bad, condensing the entire series into a two-hour feature film and uploaded it onto Vimeo. They had worked on the film for around two years prior to its release.https://www.fuse.tv/2017/03/breaking-bad-the-movie-two-hour-fan-edit- videohttps://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/breaking-bad-fans-movie However the film was soon taken down for copyright violation.https://www.vox.com/2017/3/15/14909638/breaking-bad-the-movie- comparisonhttps://www.indiewire.com/2017/03/breaking-bad-series-fan-edit- condensed-1201793780/ Fair use issues While fan edits skirt the lines of fair use, the fan editing community largely emphasizes the use of the final product should only be for those who own the source material (commercial home video releases such as DVD), and are not to be distributed for profit or other personal gain. Lucasfilm is aware of the existence of Star Wars fan edits, and has stated they will take action when they believe copyright infringement has taken place. In July 2007, Lucasfilm took action against fan editor \\"daveytod\\" after taking issue with his fan edit documentary of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, named The Clones Revealed. Their email to him cited the possibility of \\"consumer confusion,\\" that The Clones Revealed might be mistaken for an official Lucasfilm product. The email was sent to several active members of the fan editing community and resulted in the short down time of Fanedit.org. The reasoning given by Lucasfilm's anti-piracy team during communications with Fanedit.org moderators seemed to display the mistaken impression that The Clones Revealed was a bootleg of the film. In November 2008, Fanedit.org was briefly closed after receiving a complaint from the Motion Picture Association of America regarding the use of links to its copyrights appearing on the site. After a three-day downtime, the website reopened without any links to potentially infringing files. Fanedit.org has a policy to not allow fan edits made from pirated versions of films to be listed in its database. One notable victim of this policy is The Purist Edit of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, made from a DVD screener leak of the film's theatrical version. Despite being one of the earliest major fan edits available and having historical importance, it is not listed on Fanedit.org.

Holm joined the CIA in the 1960s, and in his first assignment served in the CIA's secret war in Laos against the communists in the lead-up to the Vietnam War. Holm was then posted to the Congo and suffered near-fatal burns over 35% of his body from a plane crash. His horrific burns were treated by local tribesmen with a black paste made of snake oil and tree bark. He remained in their care for 10 days until he was finally rescued and quickly sent back to America for medical care. His body permanently scarred, Holm returned to service after two years of extensive medical care in the United States, serving for several more decades in the CIA and achieving legendary status within the Agency. Holm worked in Hong Kong and Paris and was instrumental in anti–terrorism operations during Carlos the Jackal’s international terror campaign. Holm's final assignment was Chief of the CIA Station in Paris, where he was held responsible when French authorities uncovered a CIA operation involving economic espionage. In the operation, a female American CIA undercover operative, posing as the representative of a US non-profit, enjoyed clandestine meetings with a French official to obtain secret trade information. The American operative fell in love with the French official and allegedly behaved irresponsibly, her lack of discretion leading to the discovery of the operation. Holm was publicly expelled by the French Government along with several other CIA agents posing as diplomats; Holm denied responsibility by claiming the American operative hid her romantic relationship with the French official from the CIA. According to Christopher Lynch, Dick Holm unfairly made the American operative the scapegoat for a series of problems at the station despite her having '\\"had little or nothing to do with some of the cases and officers involved.\\" In 2004, Holm published his memoirs, The American Agent (). Another volume of his memoirs, The Craft We Chose: My Life in the CIA, was published in August 2011 by Mountain Lake Press ().

These activities may take place as live events, written publications, online programs, audio, video, or other electronic media. Content for these programs is developed, reviewed, and delivered by faculty who are experts in their individual clinical areas. Similar to the process used in academic journals, any potentially conflicting financial relationships for faculty members must be both disclosed and resolved in a meaningful way. However, critics complain that drug and device manufacturers often use their financial sponsorship to bias CMEs towards marketing their own products. Historical context Continuing medical education is not a new concept. From essentially the beginning of institutionalized medical instruction (medical instruction affiliated with medical colleges and teaching hospitals), health practitioners continued their learning by meeting with their peers. Grand rounds, case discussions, and meetings to discuss published medical papers constituted the continuing learning experience. In the 1950s through to the 1980s, CME was increasingly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Concerns regarding informational bias (both intentional and unintentional) led to increasing scrutiny of the CME funding sources. This led to the establishment of certifying agencies such as the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education which is an umbrella organization representing medical associations and bodies of academic medicine from the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Europe. The pharmaceutical industry has also developed guidelines regarding drug detailing and industry sponsorship of CME, such as the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (PAAB) and Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&D;).  Requirements  In the United States, many states require CME for medical professionals to maintain their licenses. Within the United States, CME for physicians is regulated by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). In Canada, certification is provided by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) and the College of Family Physicians Canada (CFPC). The RCPSC is responsible for the development and implementation of all certifying examinations in each specialty other than Family Medicine. Specialist physicians who join the Royal College as Fellows maintain their knowledge, skills, competence and performance through participating in the Maintenance of Certification Program. For each five-year cycle, fellows of the college are required to document 400 credits, with a minimum of 40 credits obtained in each year of the cycle. Credits are earned at one to two credits per hour, based on the type of learning activity. The CFPC requires 250 credit-hours over a five-year cycle. Fifty credits must be obtained for each year of the cycle. To earn and maintain fellowship within the college, an additional 24 credit-hours of higher level learning are also required over each learning cycle. Similarly, each province and territory requires documentation of ongoing CME for licensure. Production of CME courses Continuing medical education activities are developed and delivered by a variety of organizations, including: * Professional associations * Medical education agencies * Hospitals * Educational institutions, including universities, medical and nursing schools * Home study nursing continuing education providers Activities may be classified as Formal Learning Activities, including live planned programs, enduring materials (such as DVD- and web- based content), Process Improvement CME (or PI-CME, as defined by the American Medical Association), or Informal Learning Activities such as Internet-Point of Care (POC) research and decision making, or journal clubs whose members evaluate published research for mutual awareness and benefit, or online professional communities.Trentin G. (Ed) (2014). Network-Based Continuing Medical Education: Social Media and Professional Development. Nova Science Publishers, Inc., Hauppauge, NY, . https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260311473_Network- Based_Continuing_Medical_Education_Social_Media_and_Professional_Development/ In 2008, professional certification for CME planners was established by the National Commission for Certification of CME Professionals which is earned by standardized exam, and confers the Certified CME Professional (CCMEP) certificate. NC-CME maintains a registry of these certified professionals. As of June 2011, the Registry included 320 professionals.  Criticism of industry sponsorship Critics, such as Morris and Taitsman, would prefer that the medical profession eliminate commercial support for CME. Despite ACCME requirements that program content be free of commercial interests, \\"CME providers can easily pitch topics designed to attract commercial sponsorship,\\" and sponsors can award grants to programs that support their marketing strategies. The Institute of Medicine has said that CME has become too reliant on industry funding that \\"tends to promote a narrow focus on the products and to neglect provisions of a broader education on alternative strategies,\\" such as communication and prevention.Institute of Medicine, Conflict of interest in medical research, education, and practice. Washington, D.C., National Academies Press, 2009. For example, gabapentin (Neurontin), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adjunctive therapy in epilepsy, but Warner-Lambert sponsored CME activities that encouraged its use for off-label indications. The U.S. Department of Justice brought civil and criminal charges against Warner-Lambert, which Warner-Lambert settled for $430 million, alleging that Warner-Lambert paid kickbacks to doctors in the form of lavish trips to attend presentations about off-label uses.Warner-Lambert to pay $430 million to resolve criminal & civil health care liability relating to off- label promotion. Press release of the U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC, May 13, 2004. More recently, AstraZeneca PLC has been fined $520 million in the United States for off-label promotion to doctors for their anti- psychotic drug, Seroquel. Industry-sponsored CMEs can violate federal statutes, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \\"When a pharmaceutical manufacturer rewards high-prescribing physicians by directing a CME provider to pay (or overpay) them as CME faculty, consultants, or members of a speaker's bureau,\\" wrote Morris and Taitsman.

UDEM was a small school founded by the Daughters of the Immaculate Mary of Guadalupe, the nuns of the Sacred Heart, the Marist Brothers and the La Salle members, supported by an association of Catholic citizens. The idea originated from a recommendation given by the Second Vatican Council to use educational activities in favor of teaching the principles of the catholic doctrine. The founding religious groups already had a deep history in Monterrey. The Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus had been working in Monterrey since 1908, and the Sisters of Immaculate Mary of Guadalupe founded Labastida University in 1951, and had been running Labastida College since 1919, an institution devoted to the education of girls and young ladies. On the other hand, the Marist Brothers had been working in Monterrey since 1905, and La Salle Brothers, who had left Mexico during the Revolution war, returned in 1942 to Monterrey to found the Instituto Regiomontano. On July 8, 1969, the university was recognized as such by the state of Nuevo Leon and on September 8 of the same year, it began operating as an educational institution housed in 5 different facilities owned by the very same groups and associations that funded it, such as Labastida school. Until one day a philanthropist named Roberto Garza Sada who studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology searching to elevate education in Nuevo Leon Mexico started searching for some educators and at the same time for a piece of land bought the campus property and gave the money to start building this university on which later his daughter Margarita Garza Sada, looking to honor her father, and with Japanese Architect Tadao Ando, gave the money to build the Centro Roberto Garza Sada for Architecture and Design. Currently, UDEM educates over 16 thousand students, including high school students, undergraduates and postgraduates. The school offers 4 high school modes, 46 majors, 13 bachelor degrees and 37 medical specialties and doctorates. UDEM offers a number of choices to study abroad; UDEM has established bilateral, reciprocal and unilateral agreements, as well as arrangements through academic exchange agencies. In 2002, UDEM signed 26 new bilateral agreements with universities in the United States – such as the University of California – Berkeley and other universities in Spain, Italy, Belgium, England (such as University College, London), Germany and France (such as the Lycée Bossuet-Notre Dame, in Paris). History Inauguration of the Rector's Building. By 1972, UDEM had 22 majors and 3 baccalaureate degree programs. That same year, 7 more academic divisions were created, amongst which were the Arts and Media Sciences, Education, Economics, Law, Mathematics, Health Studies and Social Studies. In 1979, a Mexican philanthropist named Roberto Garza Sada formed the Association for Educational Development, which sole purpose was to buy 35 acres of land in which they would build the actual campus for UDEM. drafts of the Gate of CreationIn 1982, activities in the Humberto Lobo UDEM high school begin and on August 21, 1998 the college community center is inaugurated in the presence of the then Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo. In January 2004, the Rector's building was constructed which houses dean's offices, the Center for Information and Student Attention (Centro de Información y Atención a Alumnos; CIAA), amongst other things. In July 2006, the new student dorms were inaugurated. In 2009, after 16 years of being the dean of UDEM, Francisco Ascúnaga Guerra resigned from his position and was succeeded Antonio Dieck Assad, who is the current dean. Currently, the building, named Centro Roberto Garza Sada in honor of the benefactor which bought the terrain where the school now stands, was designed by the famed Japanese architect Tadao Ando who originally called it \\"The Gate of Creation\\". The building's over 43 thousand ft² and was planned from its conception as a design, arts and architecture building. It will have several areas dedicated to these studies, as well as 22 laboratories and workshops to accommodate students expositions and art exhibits.http://www.udem.edu.mx/Esp/CRGS/Paginas/home-CRGS.aspx In 1982, the Vice-Rectory for Upper Middle Education was created and the activities of the Humberto Lobo High School began.

Seal Originally created by Ignacio Villareal Junco, UDEM's seal consists of three books meant to symbolize the letters \\"U\\" and \\"M\\" in Universidad de Monterrey. The university colors are yellow and black and are usually added to the seal image. According to its creator, the color yellow signifies the light of knowledge, sensibility and intuition. In 2002, two circles which contained the Latin phrase Homo Hominis In Servitio Perficitur when translated means \\"Man is perfected in the service of man\\". Finally, laurels were added to the image which symbolize triumph and success. In 2014, UDEM evolved its graphic identity. In the highest point has the university name: \\"Universidad de Monterrey\\", the circles contain the Latin phrase that currently serves as the University's motto. This phrase Homo Hominis In Ministerio Perficitur when translated means \\"Man is perfected in the service of man\\" and the mirrored laurels.  2020 Campaign  In December 2019, the University of Monterrey launched the campaign \\"UDEM Inspiring your best version\\". With the conviction that \\"there are things that are not learned at the University, but they are learned at UDEM\\", as the campaign theme invokes, with the aim of raising the profile of its graduates through comprehensive training, institution seeks to promote and sow in the young values of service, integrity, innovation and leadership. Campus UDEM has only one university campus located in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. But also has four preparatory locations (translated as units from the Spanish word for Unidades). Said locations are San Pedro Campus(USP) located in the boundaries of the university campus,http://www.udem.edu.mx/Esp/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad-San- Pedro.aspxhttp://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad-San-Pedro.aspx Valle Alto Campus (UVA) located in the Estanzuela, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico,http://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad-Valle- Alto.aspxhttp://www.udem.edu.mx/Esp/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad-Valle-Alto.aspx Fundadores Campus (UFU) located in Escobedo, Nuevo Leon, Mexicohttp://www.udem.edu.mx/Esp/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad- Fundadores.aspxhttp://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad- Fundadores.aspx and the Obispado Campus (UNO) located in the Monterrey area.http://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad- Obis.aspxhttp://www.udem.edu.mx/Esp/Preparatoria/Pages/Unidad-Obis.aspx In addition classes of the Nursing Degrees on Campus CHRISTUS Health Muguerza Conchita Hospital are offered.http://www.christusmuguerza.com.mx/escuela-de- enfermeria/ Some of the businesses that have a presence on the main UDEM campus are: * Bachiller, Bookstore and stationery * Copimex of Monterrey, Copy and Print Center * Exa Campus Store (Apple Inc.

The building also houses the CIAA or Center for Information and Student Attention as translated to English. On 2003 it was inaugurated. Local Architect Bernardo Hinojosahttp://www.bernardohinojosa.com.mx/contenido.asp?seccion=5 (In Spanish) oversaw the project. The building also houses the vice-rectory for high school education, college education, development and administrative departments. A red and black sculpture called La Serpentina adorns the main plaza of the building, it was created by Fernando González Gortázar,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/369/36908811.pdf an artist from Guadalajara. The red color symbolizes the warmth of human beings and as the flame within all of us to succeed. =CCU= CCU Inaugurated in 1999 by former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, CCU stands for Centro de la Comunidad Universitaria and translates to Community College Center. The CCU is a recreational area for students which also houses the Culture department (in charge of all artistic events within the University or by the University's alumni), Pastoral Care department, the student council headquarters, a small chapel, the cafeteria, the music rooms, an auditorium, a common room and the film club. A yellow statue entitled \\"The Man\\" adorns the main lobby. It was made by Oaxaca-born artist Rufino Arellanes Tamayo, who has also contributed to UDEM with countless other works and serves as a symbol for the institution. In his words, The Man represents the origin, middle and end of culture. There is also a half-moon sculpture, adorned with closed fists, called The Tree of The Community created by Jorge Elizondo. It is also found on the CCU's main lobby and serves as a reminder of all the people and groups that believed in the concept of a school such as UDEM. Each hand has a name plate at its base. =The bell= \\"Vox Veritatis\\". When a student graduates, one of the most symbolic processes before fully graduating is to sound the bell. Its name is Vox Veritas which means \\"The Voice of Truth\\" and must be tolled three times total when a student has finished the requirements for his/her degree. Each toll means a commitment the student makes to always uphold the truth, fight for justice and remain honest throughout his or her life. If a student graduates Magna cum laude or Summa cum laude, the amount of tolls raises to four or five. It is one of the school's oldest traditions. =Library= In 1987 the library system of UDEM was consolidated and still operates today from the main/central library located at UDEM's campus and three other department libraries found in UDEM's preparatories. UDEM's library counts with up to 44 direct collective bargaining with local and national institutions, a total of 222,524 volumes of books, videos and E-book, a collection of 408,589 well known and globally recognized academic journals (in both press and on-line), a data base of 23,234 archived documents from institutions such as EBSCO, ProQuest, Wilson, Infolatina, Britannica, Ocenet, Gale and Routledge.http://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Biblioteca/Pages/Biblioteca-UDEM.aspx Among the library's most important collections, you can find: *Colección Xavier Moyssén about which deals with Mexican Art History and is restricted to authorized personnel. *INEGI's Library =Student dorms= UDEM's Dorms being inaugurated by the school's officials. In Mexico, it is uncommon for college students to leave their homes and start living by themselves. Fraternities and sororities are rarely heard of. However, schools like UDEM receive a vast amount of foreign exchange students and, even when it is uncommon, people will eventually leave their homes and begin living independently. For these reasons, UDEM started a student housing project called Residencias UDEM meaning UDEM Residence Halls. They were inaugurated in 2006 after 13 months of being planned and occupied over 14 acres within the grounds of the UDEM's campus. The project was overseen by authorities from Harvard university, Yale, Loyola and the University of the Americas (UDLA), as well as benefactors like Jane Wright from the Hanbury Evans Wright Vlattas firm. The dorms house up to 450 students.http://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Vida-Estudiantil/Pages/Eres- Foraneo/Residencias/residencias-home.aspx = Centro Roberto Garza Sada (CRGS) = The Roberto Garza Sada Center (CRGS), named in honor of Don Roberto Garza Sada, was designed by Tadao Andō, one of the most recognized architects in the world and awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1995. The final investment of the work is around 45 million dollars, 21 being the main benefactor Doña Márgara Garza Sada de Fernández, daughter of Roberto Garza Sada. CRGS The architectural work, baptized by its author as the \\"Gate of Creation\\", was officially inaugurated on April 29, 2013 in the presence of the Japanese architect, Doña Márgara Garza Sada de Fernández, the Governor in charge, Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, the former municipal president of San Pedro Garza García, Mauricio Fernández Garza, among other business, political and academic personalities. The idea of this work is to inspire through the aesthetics of the building. The author wanted to respond to the challenge of the mountain in the background, somehow inspires students to cross the door and transcend. He transmits through art the education that Don Roberto Garza Sada, benefactor of the UDEM, had. This building has 1,300 cubic meters of concrete whose gray color is in harmony with the tones of the Huasteca and has 13,115.48 square meters of construction, distributed in spaces for design, research, teaching and exhibition, as well as 22 laboratories and workshops which design students can use.

ESTOA It has a privileged location to the west of the campus that, connected to El Solar and, next to the Roberto Garza Sada Center for Art, Architecture and Design, serves as the new main entrance to the University. This building fulfills the functions of a public square as a platform for inclusive social life abroad and also functions as a prelude to the university. The construction meets the same needs of the agoras, where knowledge was imparted in ancient Greece; As a public space it was an ideal place for social life in Mediterranean cities; sometimes it also fulfilled commercial, philosophical and pedagogical functions. This derives from the name of stoicism, since in it the philosopher Zenón de Citio imparted his teachings to his disciples in Athens. The building located to the west of the campus has approximately 90 thousand square meters of construction, which accommodates student and coexistence areas and UDEM offices for customer service, in addition to Continuing Education rooms. = El Solar = El Solar UDEM It covers the construction of a South Plaza, currently in use and a North Plaza or Cultural Plaza –on the western side of the project–, which together represent 7,900 m2 for the meeting and coexistence of the UDEM community, in addition to the area of the ravine - the east side. With this space, the University of Monterrey has continued the transformation of its campus as a sustainable infrastructure through the recovery of wooded areas where there were previously parking lots. The UDEM campus has a project that integrates vegetation from the region, design of pedestrian roads according to different needs and a gorge that includes a water mirror and a hermitage for reflection.

Its main purpose was to promote experience education and an eco-friendly culture. The course is made up of rope lanes, rappel and hiking, besides offering national and international camping trips.http://www.udem.edu.mx/Eng/Investigacion-y-Desarrollo/Centro- Liderazgo-Desafio-Lanzate/Pages/Informacion-General.aspx The center was built according to the standards of ACCT (Association for Challenge Course Technology), which regulates the quality in this type of structures and counts with qualified instructors. The design of the programs was made following the guidelines of the Association for Experiential Education (AEE). Finally, the architectural design of the piece was in charge of Enrique Abaroa, as well as Challenge Towers, globally recognized for creating the \\"Discovery Course\\" which offers over 24 different challenges. Only four like this exist in the world, and this is the only in Mexico.

Knežević is best-known as portraitist, having produced more than 200 portraits, mostly of notable people of his time. Life He was born in Sremski Karlovci to father Teodor and mother Julijana. Even though he spent most of his life in Serbia, there is very little information about his life. About his first years of education the artist himself wrote that he had enjoyed drawing even as a child and that he felt thoroughly devoted to drawing. He first studied drawing at the Karlovci Gymnasium. He transfers from Vojvodina to Serbia in 1834, where he actively practices painting until 1844. His work was essential in introducing art to Serbia and educating the local population in art appreciation. During his time in Serbia he supported himself by painting portraits of the local nobility and prominent citizens. However, the local population was still quite unwelcoming of the art, and the portrait fees were often not paid. This made it difficult for Knežević to earn enough to support himself, let alone to save enough for his education in Vienna. Even the royal family refused to pay for the many portraits, coats of arms and other symbols that Knežević made for them. Finally, he found well-paying work in painting walls and icons for Belgrade churches. This enabled him to save enough to study in Vienna. About his stay in Vienna he writes that it was a very happy time of his life, and he was the happiest when his work was recognized by being exhibited in the Viennese Art Exhibition of 1846. However, the Viennese Royal Art Academy does not even have a record of his name among the students. Some sources indicate that Knežević also painted the portraits of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (Serbian linguist and reformer of the Serbian language) and his family, apart from the military, civic and political leadership. According to the portraits made by Knežević, it can be concluded that Serbian leaders tended towards modernization; hence their portraits with remarkably luxurious clothes; golden braided and richly embroidered. In 1871 Knežević became sick and started working less. He is considered one of the foremost Serbian portraitist of the nineteenth century.

The book includes individual essays published between 1936 and 1951 to create the first edition in 1951. Nabokov's revised and extended edition appeared in 1966. Scope The book is dedicated to his wife, Vera, and covers his life from 1903 until his emigration to America in 1940. The first twelve chapters describe Nabokov's remembrance of his youth in an aristocratic family living in pre-revolutionary Saint Petersburg and at their country estate Vyra, near Siverskaya. The three remaining chapters recall his years at Cambridge and as part of the Russian émigré community in Berlin and Paris. Through memory Nabokov is able to possess the past. Nabokov published \\"Mademoiselle O\\", which became Chapter Five of the book, in French in 1936, and in English in The Atlantic Monthly in 1943, without indicating that it was non-fiction. Subsequent pieces of the autobiography were published as individual or collected stories, with each chapter able to stand on its own. Andrew Field observed that while Nabokov evoked the past through “puppets of memory” (in the characterizations of his educators, Colette, or Tamara, for example), his intimate family life with Véra and Dmitri remained \\"untouched\\". Field indicated that the chapter on butterflies is an interesting example how the author deploys the fictional with the factual. It recounts, for example, how his first butterfly escapes at Vyra, in Russia, and is \\"overtaken and captured\\" forty years later on a butterfly hunt in Colorado. The book's opening line, \\"The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness,\\" is arguably a paraphrase of Thomas Carlyle's \\"One Life; a little gleam of Time between two Eternities,\\" found in Carlyle's 1840 lecture \\"The Hero as Man of Letters,\\" published in On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History in 1841. There is also a similar concept expressed in On the nature of things by the Roman Poet Lucretius. The line is parodied at the start of Little Wilson and Big God, the autobiography of the English writer Anthony Burgess. \\"If you require a sententious opening, here it is. Wedged as we are between two eternities of idleness, there is no excuse for being idle now.\\"cite web url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.65762/2015.65762.Little- Wilson-And-Big-God_djvu.txt Nabokov inherited the Rozhdestveno mansion from his uncle in 1916 Nabokov writes in the text that he was dissuaded from titling the book Speak, Mnemosyne by his publisher, who feared that readers would not buy a \\"book whose title they could not pronounce\\". It was first published in a single volume in 1951 as Speak, Memory in the United Kingdom and as Conclusive Evidence in the United States. The Russian version was published in 1954 and called Drugie berega (Other Shores). An extended edition including several photographs was published in 1966 as Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited. In 1999 Alfred A. Knopf issued a new edition with the addition of a previously unpublished section titled \\"Chapter 16\\". There are variations between the individually published chapters, the two English versions, and the Russian version. Nabokov, having lost his belongings in 1917, wrote from memory, and explains that certain reported details needed corrections; thus the individual chapters as published in magazines and the book versions differ. Also, the memoirs were adjusted to either the English- or Russian-speaking audience. It has been proposed that the ever-shifting text of his autobiography suggests that \\"reality\\" cannot be \\"possessed\\" by the reader, the \\"esteemed visitor\\", but only by Nabokov himself. Nabokov had planned a sequel under the title Speak on, Memory or Speak, America. He wrote, however, a fictional autobiographic memoir of a double persona, Look at the Harlequins!, apparently being upset by a real biography published by Andrew Field. Chapters The chapters were individually published as follows—in the New Yorker, unless otherwise indicated: * \\"Mademoiselle O\\" (Chapter Five), published first in French in Mesures in 1936, portrays his French-speaking Swiss governess, Mademoiselle Cécile Miauton, who arrived in the winter of 1906. In English, it was first published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1943, and included in the Nine Stories collection (1947) as well as in Nabokov's Dozen (1958) and the posthumous The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov. * \\"Portrait of My Uncle\\" (Chapter Three), 1948, gives an account of his ancestors as well as his uncle \\"Ruka\\". Nabokov describes that in 1916 he inherited \\"what would amount nowadays to a couple of million dollars\\" and the estate Rozhdestveno, next to Vyra, from his uncle, but lost it all in the revolution. * \\"My English Education\\" (Chapter Four), 1948, presents the houses at Vyra and St. Petersburg and some of his educators. * \\"Butterflies\\" (Chapter Six), 1948, introduces a lifelong passion of Nabokov. * \\"Colette\\" (Chapter Seven), 1948, remembers a 1909 family vacation at Biarritz where he met a nine-year-old girl whose real name was Claude Deprès. As \\"First Love\\" the story is also included in Nabokov's Dozen. * \\"My Russian Education\\" (Chapter Nine), 1948, depicts his father. * \\"Curtain-Raiser\\" (Chapter Ten), 1949, describes the end of boyhood. * \\"Portrait of My Mother\\" (Chapter Two), 1949, also discusses his synesthesia. * \\"Tamara\\" (Chapter Twelve), 1949, describes a love affair that took place when he was seventeen, she sixteen. Her real name was Valentina Shulgina. * \\"First Poem\\" (Chapter Eleven), 1949, published in Partisan Review, analyzes Nabokov's first attempt at poetry. * \\"Lantern Slides\\" (Chapter Eight), 1950, recalls various educators and their methods. * \\"Perfect Past\\" (Chapter One), 1950, contains early childhood memories including the Russo-Japanese war. * \\"Gardens and Parks\\" (Chapter Fifteen), 1950, is a recollection of their journey directed more personally to Véra. * \\"Lodgings in Trinity Lane\\" (Chapter Thirteen), 1951, published in Harper's Magazine, describes his time at Cambridge and talks about his brothers. * \\"Exile\\" (Chapter Fourteen), 1951, published in Partisan Review, relates his life as an émigré and includes a chess problem. Reception The book was instantly called a masterpiece by the literary world. In 2011, Time Magazine listed the book among the 100 All- TIME non-fiction books indicating that its \\"impressionist approach deepens the sense of memories relived through prose that is gorgeous, rich and full\\". Joseph Epstein lists Nabokov's book among the few truly great autobiographies. While he opines that it is odd that so great a writer as Nabokov has not been able to generate passion in his readers for his own greatest passion, chess and butterflies, he finds that the autobiography succeeds \\"at making a reasonable pass at understanding that greatest of all conundrums, its author's own life\\". Jonathan Yardley writes that the book is witty, funny and wise, \\"at heart it is … deeply humane and even old-fashioned\\", with an \\"astonishing prose\\". He indicates that while any autobiography is \\"inherently an act of immodesty\\", the real subject is the development of the inner and outer self, an act that can plunge the subject into \\"the abyss of self\\". Richard Gilbert who finds the long genealogical histories tedious notes that Nabokov apparently bullied his younger brother and \\"doesn't pretend to guilt he doesn't feel\\", nor is he asking for sympathy when his idyllic world is crushed by the Russian revolution.

He became known as the father of the Outdoor Movement. Born in Guilford, Connecticut, he graduated from Yale in 1862 and then served as a minister in Greenwich, Connecticut and Meriden, Connecticut. He also served as pastor of Park Street Church in Boston from 1868 to 1874. He also delivered Sunday evening lectures about the Adirondacks in a Boston music-hall that proved highly popular, and he published a series of articles based on the lectures in a Meriden newspaper. In 1869, they were published as a book, Adventures in the Wilderness; or, Camp-Life in the Adirondacks. The literary tone of the book made it extremely successful; it went through eight printings in its first year. Murray promoted New York's north woods as health-giving and spirit- enhancing, claiming that the rustic nobility typical of Adirondack woodsmen came from their intimacy with wilderness. A subsequent printing, subtitled Tourist's Edition, included maps of the region and train schedules from various Eastern cities to the Adirondacks.

It covers an area of . The average depth of the lake is .  Geology  Despite popular belief, Lake Palić is not a remnant of the vast Pannonian Sea which covered this area and completely drained out some 600,000 years ago. It is estimated that both the Palić and Ludoš lakes originated in the early Holocene, around 10,000 years ago, when the last major changes in the surrounding terrain occurred. Prior to that, since the draining of the sea, the European climate was much colder, with the exchange of the cold and dry and the warm and wet periods. Alternatively being frozen and defrosted, the rocks crushed under the ice and crumbled into the dust, which formed sand and loess. The winds would then disperse the loess into the valleys of the Danube and Tisza rivers to the southeast. On the wet grounds, the loess became more compact, becoming thinner and claylike. The surrounding dried land became more and more elevated thus creating the depressions which began to collect water. The process was helped with the erosion which was caused by the water flowing into the depressions. Due to the unstable hydrological regime, the lake constantly disappeared and reappeared through history. The lake is shallow, with an average depth of , while the deepest point is . It is long and up to wide. The idea that the lake was remnant of the sea was influenced by its geographical location (in the bed of the former sea) and the fact that the water in the lake was salty. It is more likely that both lakes and the nearby river of Körös-ér are remnants of the former rivers which spilled over the Pannonian basin. Surveys showed that the loess layers are younger than the alluvial ones, so the lakes can't be remains of the former Danube's flow as the wind would naturally cover them with sand and loess.  Human history  The popular local legend of the lake's origin, which also explains the name, says that the shepherd Paul (Pal in Hungarian, Pavle in Serbian) was pasturing his sheep in the area. He had a lamb with the golden fleece but the lamb disappeared one day and the inconsolable Paul cried so much that his tears flooded the pasture and created the salty lake. The lake was then named Paligo Palus in Latin, Palics in Hungarian or Pavlova bara in Serbian. The lake was mentioned for the first time in June 1462 when Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus bestowed it to his mother, Queen Mother of Hungary, Erzsébet Szilágyi, as part of the puszta-like Csongrád County. It was mentioned as Palij. In Ottoman inscription from 1580, it was recorded as the village of Palegyhaza in Subotica nahiyah. The writing says the village has 10 houses. and that all pay taxes. In 1845 the first spa bathroom with wooden baths and an inn were built. Data on the quality of the water originate from 1847 when the first chemical analysis was done. The lake became a spa and the water was used for the soda water production. From the late 19th and into the most of the 20th century, the cyclic development of the overgrowth followed by the fish kill were common. In 1970 the eutrophication reached its peak and almost all the wildlife in the lake died. In 1971 the lake was dried, the sludge was dredged and removed, the filters were placed and the lake was refilled in 1976, but in the next decades, the lake got polluted again. The town of Palić is located on the northern shores of the lake, where in time parks and hotels developed. As it wasn’t allowed at the time for men and women to bath together, the Muški Štrand (Male beach) was formed on the east, and Ženski Štrand (Female beach) on the west. They are divided by the small promontory, which is named Ljubavni Rt (Love Cape). Along the lake, the “first modern Olympic games” were held on 26 August 1880, sixteen years before the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first modern Olympics. The games included fencing, running, stone throwing, wrestling and bicycle riding around the lake, which became a traditional event. The games were organized by Lajoš Vermeš, a school friend and a roommate of Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of modern Olympism. Named the \\"Palić Olympics\\", the games became international in 1884 when first athletes from Serbia participated, as the lake was part of Austria Hungary at the time. Vermeš invested into the construction of various sports objects and lodging venues, including the eliptic track, long, with the bleachers, so it was called the Enclosed Arena. He also constructed and paved the bicycle racing track. Investing his own money, Vermeš went bankrupt and the games were discontinued with the outbreak of the World War I in 1914. Đuro Stantić, who participated in the Palić games, later won a gold medal at 1906 Intercalated Games which were considered a \\"proper Olympics\\" at the time.  Wildlife  Over 200 bird species live in the protected section of the lake. During the emptying and refilling of the lake in the 1970s, artificial island made of the dried sludge were formed. They became known as the birds islands, and are today the only nesting location of black-headed gull in Serbia. Surrounding shrubs are habitats of some of the most endangered birds in Serbia, like the migrating pygmy cormorant and razorbill.  Preservation  Sunset over the lake Only in 2015 a spatial plan was finished, which included the area between the lakes Palić and the neighboring Krvavo Lake, which is divided from Palić by a small embankment. The covered area includes on which the lots were enlarged in an effort to make it easier for the construction of the future complex (closed and opened swimming pools, aqua park, hotel complex, etc.) All previous plans also include the revitalization of the Palić Spa. Works on improving the lake area include: removal of all sources which pollute the lake with nitrogen and phosphorus, which effectively kills the lake; construction of the sewage system around the lake; creation of the protective buffer zone which would prevent the nutrients from the arable land in the vicinity to reach the lake; replacement of the fish species in the lake; tightened regime of the purifying sewage water from Subotica, which still empties into the lake. Some of the experimental works on a small section of the lake which is not opened for tourists showed some success, but as of 2017 everything is still just at the planning stage. Expropriation of the surrounding land is expected to be finished by the end of 2017 which would allow the formation of the buffer zone and the sewage in the town of Palić was to be done by 2018. The sand filter apparatus (peskolov, \\"sand catcher\\") managed to remove enough phosphate from the water to lower it down to below while the nitrogen level remained a bit above the allowed quantities even though the purifier removed 70% of nitrogen. Still, the pinky foam formed on the lake several times in the 2017-18 period and the results showed that the quality of the water deteriorated. Experts involved in the process of preservation don't have a definite answer why: a long period of previous pollution, weather conditions, draught, several malfunctions of the filter (January-March and August- September 2017), etc. The 2018 tests showed that the major pollutant of the water are fecal bacteria. It is estimated that it will take at least 5 years for the lake to heal. In the spring of 2019, it was decided to fish out the Prussian carp, omnivorous and voracious fish, which became abundant in the lake. In several months, over 20 tons of Prussian carp were fished. After the project was done, results showed the first improvement in the quality of the lake water since 1998. Though still categorized as the lowest, fifth category and not suitable for swimming, the water had less ammoniacal and nitrite compounds, and less algae while zooplankton Daphnia, which feeds on phytoplankton, reappeared in the lake. Another problem is the poaching. Apart from the direct damage in reducing number of animals (including the protected European pond turtle), it also affects the natural purification of water. The main catch for the poachers is the zander, which, as a predator, is very important in the lake's food chain. Further expropriation needed for the buffer zone was conducted in 2019-2020. The entire surrounding area was already expropriated in 1974, when the lake was emptied. However, the erosion since then eroded the banks, so the privately owned parcels which were further from the lake, are now on its banks. The buffer zone consists of four layers: 1) reed bed, in the water itself, which prevents the erosion of the banks by the waves and forms habitat for the birds; 2) bank slopes, inhabited by the herbaceous plants and habitat for the reptiles; 3) grassy areas, used only by those who administer and watch the protected areas; 4) pedestrian and bicycle path, with benches and stops where possible. In order to create the buffer zone, a monoculture of wild blackberry shrubs which spread all over the lake, had to be eradicated. It was replaced with other plants, mainly alfalfa, which prevent expansion of the invasive herbaceous plants. In February 2020, it was reported that some bird species, previously absent, were spotted at the lake.  Tourism  Fountain in Palić Zoo On 31 May 1950, a small zoo with only three animals (bear, monkey and parrot) was opened above the northwest corner of the lake. By 2020, Palić Zoo grew to , with being available to the visitors, and hundred species with 450 individual specimens. It is known for the wast animal spaces, surrounded by an arboretum with 320 plant species and a nursery garden. Core of the park are several oak trees, planted in the 1710s. The zoo has over 150,000 visitors yearly. Lake Palić has a relatively short summer season. Influenced by the Hungarian border wellness and spa centers which operate the entire year (Mórahalom, Szeged, Makó, Gyula), the idea of building a wellness complex with the spa was launched in 2006. Master plan for Palić was made in 2007 and the revitalization plan in 2014. Construction of the wellness and spa center began on 15 December 2018. The entire complex will cover an area of with 10 swimming pools, water slides and other aqua park attractions. The works stalled so in February 2020 the government stepped inn and changed the contractor giving it deadline of 8 months to finish the works. Despite claims of the local tourist organization that number of tourists grew, the corresponding minister Rasim Ljajić said that the government had to intervene since out of the 18 priority tourist destinations declared by the government, Palić is the only one where number of visitors decreased. The lake is partially encircled with the long pedestrian and bicycle path. Main points of interest, mostly along the northern shore where the town of Palić reaches the lake, include the 19th century Hotel Park, surrounding park made of plane trees planted in the 1910s, former pulmonary sanatorium, luxurious Hotel Jezero, fairy-styled villa Lujza, red-orange castle and the restaurant “Riblja Čarda”, the location of the Vermeš' \\"Olympic games”. The vicinity of the lake is the location of many vineries, salaš’ adapted for the tourists and the Palić Watertower. Along the adjoining Krvavo Lake, housing for the participants of the Palić's 1970s Youth work actions was built. In the 1980s the venue housed elementary school pupils and high school students, while in the 1990s it was settled with the refugees from the Yugoslav wars.

The title is often translated into English as The Voice of Things, The Way Things Are, or The Nature of Things (perhaps to echo Lucretius, though the book's philosophical underpinnings are more often associated with phenomenology). Background =Life and career= Francis Ponge was born in 1899 in Montpellier, France. He started writing at a relatively young age, gaining notice even in the early 1920s. Like many French writers of his time, he was also politically associated, joining the ranks of the Socialist Party in 1919. As a writer, he joined the Surrealist movement for a short time during the 1930s; this also had political ramifications, influencing him to join the Communist Party. However, his most notable works were to come later in his life. He fought in both World Wars, and it was after his stint in the army in World War II that he decided to leave the Communist Party. It was at this time, in 1942, that he joined the French Resistance and also published what is considered his most famous work, Le parti pris des choses. This text was in fact written over the span of 15 years, from 1924 to 1939.Greene, Robert W. \\"Francis Ponge, Metapoet.\\" The Johns Hopkins University Press 85 (1970): 572-92. After his publication of Le parti pris des choses, Ponge was not unnoticed in the literary world. He was praised heavily by literary heavyweights Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre in the early 1960s. Furthermore, the French literary magazine Tel Quel also touted his work during this time period. While he has only recently gained more popularity in the United States, he also spent the later part of his years lecturing across the country and also was a visiting professor at Barnard College and Columbia University. Francis Ponge won several prestigious awards late in his career. This included the Neudstadt International Prize for Literature in 1974. =Motivation= Ponge's works often describe mundane objects – for example \\"The Pebble\\" or \\"The Oyster\\" – extensively, but in such a way that his works are categorized as prose poetry. Robert W. Greene, a literary critic, noted about the intentions of his works, \\"He seeks a balance of equivalences, an equation between the order of things and the order of words\\".Greene. Ponge was also influenced by the ideas of his time. He has his own ideas about the absurd, influenced by Albert Camus in a number of ways. Ponge himself wrote in the Tome Premier that he believed in the unreliability of language and criticized Camus’ views of the search for a single principle as opposed to a number of principles. Many of his writings can be seen as a way to both return to the concrete values of language while also revealing its absurdity. =Contemporaries= Ponge was well respected by his contemporaries in France and they often helped drive his literary career. An example of this was Tel Quel's praise for Ponge's works throughout the 1960s. Camus and Sartre both respected his work immensely. The philosophical movements of the time in which both Camus and Sartre were leaders in turn influenced Ponge's own work. For instance, Ponge used Camus’ ideas about absurdity to form his own views. It was in fact partly due to Sartre's praise of Ponge that he was able to win the prestigious Neudstadt Prize. Style Ponge stated that his overarching goal was to create a \\"single cosmogony\\" through his works,Ponge, Francis. \\"Concerning The ‘Pebble.’\\" Essays on Language and Literature. By Marcel Proust, et al. Ed. J L Hevesi. London: Allan Wingate Publishers Ltd, 1947. 125-142. p. 129. an aim readily apparent in poems like \\"Le Galet\\" which is a miniature cosmogony all by itself. Each of the works in the collection explores some object in the corporeal world, \\"borrowing the brevity and infallibility of the dictionary definition and the sensory aspect of the literary description\\".Brombert, Beth Archer, Mary Feeney, Louise Guiney, William T. Kulik, and William Matthews. Dreaming the Miracle: Three French Poets: Max Jacob, Francis Ponge, Jean Follain. White Pine Press, Buffalo (2003): 73-147. p. 75. Lee Fahnestock, one of Le parti pris des choses’ translators, describes the work as \\"construct[ing] a new form of definition- description\\".Ponge, Francis. The Nature of Things. Trans. Lee Fahnestock. New York: Red Dust, 2000. p. 8. The style shown in Le parti pris des choses was Ponge's first foray into what would become his definitive trademark.Brombert, p. 76. =The Objeu= Much of Ponge's poetic style reflects his idea of the \\"objeu,\\" or the \\"objective play of the mind\\".Lawall, Sarah N. \\"Ponge and the Poetry of Self-Knowledge.\\" Contemporary Literature 11.2 (1970): 192-216. JSTOR. University of Wisconsin Press Journals Division. 19 May 2009 . p. 195. The objeu is the act of pointedly choosing language or subject matter for its double meanings, hidden connections, and sensory effects on the reader. Indeed, his attitude toward the depiction of objects is neatly summed up by the saying \\"Parti Pris des Choses = Compte Tenu des Mots,\\" which translates loosely to \\"taking the side of things = taking into account the words.\\" Indeed, where pure description is inadequate to truly capture the spirit of an object, Ponge employs auditory effects (e.g. assonance, sibilance, and paronomasia) as well as images that delight all the senses.Stout, John. \\"The Text as an Object: Francis Ponge's Verbal Still Lifes.\\" Symposium 47.1 (1993): 50-63. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. 19 May 2009 . p. 52. He anthropomorphized his animal and arboreal subjects to make them more relatable.Ponge, The Nature of Things, p. 11. According to Fahnestock, the objeu allowed him to \\"say several things on several levels at once, while unobtrusively demonstrating the particular nature of words and things\\".Ponge, The Nature of Things, p. 9. However, though Ponge attempted to evoke the feeling of the object he was describing by any possible means, he simultaneously believed that good poems were \\"the most structured, the most uninvolved, the ‘coldest’ possible\\".Lawall, p. 197. To him, the employment of the objeu was rote enough that the evocation of emotion could still be \\"cold\\" and \\"uninvolved.\\" It comes as no surprise that Ponge admired the art of such artists as Cézanne, Braque, and Picasso – Post- Impressionists and Cubists whose mission was to capture the feeling and significance in addition to the form of their subjects – for Ponge shared their goal.Lawall, p. 200-201. Though the objeu was prominent, creative interpretation and plays on words never took the reins: description was always the primary goal. When discussing \\"Le Galet,\\" Ponge stated that \\"most important for the ‘health’ of the contemplator is the naming, in the course of his investigations, of all the qualities which he discovers: these qualities, which ‘transport’ him, must not transport him beyond the limits of reasonable and accurate expression\\".Ponge, Essays on Language and Literature, p. 128. To step out of this realm would be to submit to subjectivity and self-indulgence, qualities which Ponge looked down upon above all. =Ponge and the Poetry World= While Ponge's work is most often classified as prose poetry, he publicly rejected the moniker of \\"poet\\",Andrews, Chris. Poetry and Cosmogony: Science in the Writing of Queneau and Ponge. Rodopi, Atlanta (1994): 197-226., p. 200. stating that he \\"uses poetic magma… only to get rid of it\\".Brombert, p. 80. While much commentary is focused on this, it appears from his writing style that Ponge's issue was more with the self-indulgent lyricism of some poets than with the concept of poetry itself.Andrews, p. 201. Ponge appears to have a very conflicted relationship with poetry. Though he made such statements as \\"ideas are not my forte,\\" his works abound with ideas: he stated early in his career that \\"it is less the object that must be painted than an idea of that object,\\" a statement which can be accepted alongside even his later works. Though he looks with disdain upon personal involvement, his own concept of the objeu points to great personal investment in his work. The style of description and calculated subconscious evocation that Ponge established in his early writings starting with Le parti pris des choses was emulated by later French poets, notably Yves Bonnefoy, Jacques Dupin, and André Du Bouchet, the first two of whom employ the \\"old master's\\" techniques of subtle wordplay.Lawall, p. 192, 208-214. Du Bouchet, by contrast, has taken Ponge's style of conveying sense impressions and made it his own. These poets are by no means Ponge devotees, but each has drawn something from their predecessor.Lawall, p. 214-5.  Poems  Of the poems of Ponge's self- proclaimed \\"poetic encyclopedia\\", \\"Snails\\", \\"The Pebble\\", and \\"The Mollusk\\" are often subject to scrutiny. Each displays a characteristic Pongian theme or themes. =The Pebble= \\"The Pebble\\", or \\"Le Galet\\", is easily the longest poem in the collection, being exceptionally long for the genre of prose poetry on the whole. To describe a pebble, Ponge starts at the beginning, literally, the beginning of time itself, diverging from his usual trend of descriptions and assertions. Instead, the reader gets a condensed cosmogony, describing the formation of the first rock, (the Earth, or however the reader wants to interpret it) as a sort of allegory of The Fall.Andrews, p. 208 Venturing through the \\"expulsion of life\\", \\"cooling\\", large tectonic plates, all the way down to the pebble itself, or the \\"kind of stone that I [Ponge] can pick it up and turn it over in my hand\\", the pebble comes to stand for rock as a species or entity. The metaphor not to be missed in this poem is the stone as Time, where the \\"great wheel of stone\\" rolls ever on as \\"plant life, animals, gases and liquids revolve quite rapidly in their cycles of dying\\".Ponge, The Nature of Things, p. 64. This then can be taken as Ponge's view of humanity, as he himself in an essay on \\"The Pebble\\" compares looking within himself to telling the story of the pebble. For Ponge, it is best to \\"consider all things as unknown, and to ... begin again right from the beginning\\".Ponge, Essays on Language and Literature, p. 129. Translations Le parti pris des choses has been translated into English many times. In particular, translations by translator Lee Fahnestock, poet Robert Bly, and author Beth Archer Brombert are notable. =Lee Fahnestock= Lee Fahnestock is a well-known translator. She has translated many French works, including those by Victor Hugo, Jean- Paul Sartre, and Francis Ponge. Fahnestock's translation of Le parti pris des choses is entitled The Nature of Things. While she admits that a more exact translation of \\"le parti pris des choses\\" would be something more like \\"taking the side of things\\" or \\"the side taken by things\\" (implying that the things in the poems speak for themselves without humans), Fahnestock argues that humanity \\"is never absent from the page.\\" She believes that Ponge gives his subjects human qualities, and she incorporates this idea into her translations. She also argues that when translating Ponge's work, it is sometimes best to incorporate things like rhythm, sound, and puns rather than purely literal translations of the original. Thus, she says that her goal in her translation was to maintain these effects in the English rather than always keeping the exact meaning of the words themselves.Ponge, The Nature of Things, p. 11-12. She admits that any text by Ponge is challenging to translate because of his use of colloquialisms and puns, and that while something is inevitably lost in translation, enough can be retained to demonstrate the beauty of his ideas across the language barrier.Ponge, Francis. The Making of the Pré. Trans. Lee Fahnestock. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1979. =Robert Bly= Robert Bly is very famous for own original poetry as well as his translations. His famous collections include Loving a Woman in Two Worlds, Silence in the Snowy Fields, The Morning Glory, and many more. He has translated the works of many famous authors including Kabir, Tomas Tranströmer, Rainer Maria Rilke, Rolf Jacobsen, and Francis Ponge.Jones, Richard. Of Solitude and Silence: Writings on Robert Bly. Boston: Beacon Press, 1981. Bly's work has been heavily influenced and inspired by Ponge's \\"object\\" poems, in which he finds a kind of observation of the world that is neither objective nor subjective. For Bly, Ponge is the master of close observation of objects in poetry. He says, \\"Ponge doesn’t try to be cool, distant, or objective, nor ‘let the object speak for itself.’ His poems are funny, his vocabulary immense, his personality full of quirks, and yet the poem remains somewhere in the place where the senses join the objects.\\" His work on Ponge is embodied in his book titled Ten Poems of Francis Ponge Translated by Robert Bly and Ten Poems of Robert Bly Inspired by the Poems of Francis Ponge.Nelson, Howard. Robert Bly: An Introduction to the Poetry. New York: Columbia University Press, 1984. 137. =Beth Archer Brombert= Beth Archer Brombert is a professional translator and author, and her translation of Ponge's Le parti pris des choses, titled The Voice of Things, is widely recognized. She appreciates Ponge's \\"description-definition-literary art work\\" that avoids both the dullness of a dictionary and the inadequacy of poetic description. She claims that his poems lead to an account of \\"the totality of man's view of the universe and his relationship to it.\\" She compares Ponge's poems in Le parti pris des choses to blocks of marble; words are the raw materials, and the objects Ponge describes \\"emerge as do figures from stone.\\" While she accepts that these poems are like fables in that they use objects to \\"point to a veiled meaning,\\" she claims that they are not conventional fables because their purpose is not to moralize. Instead, they show the reader that \\"the condition of life is mortality, but in death there is life,\\" and through his poems he describes the weapons against mortality.Brombert, p. 77.

History Rokon was founded in Vermont by Orla Larsen in 1963 to sell the Nethercutt Trail-Breaker, a two- wheel-drive motorcycle invented around 1958 by Charlie Fehn and built in Sylmar, California. In 1964, Rokon Inc. bought the manufacturing rights to the Trail-Breaker and marketed the bikes from their Vermont office before moving the business to New Hampshire, where they continue in business today. Design 1969 Rokon Trailbreaker two-wheel drive off-road motorcycle from The Museum of Automobiles in Arkansas.Rokon motorcycles use a combination of belt, chain and shaft drives coupled to gear boxes to drive both the front and rear wheels. Older machines were powered by a West Bend (US Motor/Chrysler Marine) 820 two-stroke engine (134cc), while newer machines have either a Honda or Kohler engine of about 6hp. Each hollow wheel is able to hold 2.5 gallons of gasoline or water for long distance trips. These are slow-speed off-road motorcycles designed for use in the most rugged terrain. Some are capable of 35mph or more, but typical top speed is about 20 mph. Current models are the Trail-Breaker, Ranger and Scout. When ascending very steep hills speed may be 0.5 mph. RT340 TCR Automatic/CVT In 1974, Rokon produced the RT340 TCR Automatic motorcycle, using a snowmobile-type Salsbury CVT, rear wheel drive only, and dual disc brakes. Another unusual feature was a pull cord to start the engine. The transmission freewheels with the engine at idle; starts to engage about 2800 RPM; and is tuned so the engine always runs near peak power, at 6,000 to 6,700 RPM. The lowest gear ratio is 3.76:1 and highest 0.87:1. Using a CVT allows a use of a 2-stroke cycle motor with higher power but narrow power band. The engine sound is unusual as the engine stays at a nearly fixed speed and the transmission ratio changes according to speed. The transmission freewheels when not driving forward, so there is no engine braking. The transmission is vented to the outside for cooling, and so is contaminated by stream crossings and other environmental exposure. Water causes slipping but quickly goes away; however grit can cause transmission sticking. Riding on loose surfaces is sometimes complicated, as rear wheel breakaway does not cause telltale changes in the engine sound. However, most other riding is intuitive and sometimes much more convenient as the automatic avoids engine stalls and other problems with gear selection. Operation is loud (90.3 dB(A)) as the engine is always running fast except at idle. Despite low front wheel weight, about 43%, it had trouble pulling wheelies, a problem for Enduro riding. Prototypes were raced by factory riders from 1971 to 1973 under Tom Clark; \\"TCR\\" stands for \\"Tom Clark Replica\\". In the 48th annual International Six Days Enduro, The 4 riders earned 3 bronze medals and 1 silver medal. \\"Cycle Guide\\" test riders reported it superior for hill climbing and fast on hard surfaces, but poor on loose surfaces and descending hills.\\"Cycle Guide\\" October 1974, page 61 See also * Tote Gote References External links *Rokon World homepage *Rokon homepage Motorcycle manufacturers of the United States Companies based in Strafford County, New Hampshire Off-road motorcycles ","title":"Rokon (motorcycle manufacturer)"},{"id":"2940427","text":"\\"South Park Is Gay!\\" is the eighth episode of the seventh season and the 104th overall episode of the American animated television series South Park. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 22, 2003. In it, Kyle struggles to understand a new metrosexual fad that has sprung around the men and boys of South Park and is the only one who does not want to conform to it. The episode features a parody of the TV show, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. In 2011, he and co-creator Matt Stone listed it as one of their least favorite episodes of the series.  Plot  After the TV show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy begins showing, metrosexuality becomes a major fad among both the men and the boys, and they all begin to act effeminate. At the school bus stop, instead of their usual winter clothing, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny wear unmasculine clothing. Kyle, who does not want to conform, is beaten up by Craig, Clyde, Token, and Jimmy at school. Cartman, Kenny, and even Stan abandon Kyle. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave, the town's gay couple, are excited at first but quickly become opposed to the fad when they realize that metrosexuals are straight men imitating gay culture and lifestyle, which Garrison believes is insulting to actual gays. The women of the town are initially in favor of their husbands' improved hygiene and willingness to communicate, but soon tire of the men becoming increasingly self-absorbed. When the wives confront the men about this, they are accused of being \\"metrophobic\\" and the men become even more feminine than before. In hopes of ending the fad, Kyle, Mr. Garrison, and Mr. Slave go to New York to kill the Fab Five, the hosts of \\"Queer Eye\\". Their mission fails but the Fab Five decide to not press charges. Mr. Garrison then tries to talk the nonchalant gay stars out of selling out gay culture for mere ratings, which only falls on deaf ears. Mr. Garrison demands to know how gays could betray their own people, and then slowly realizes that they are not gay at all. The five suddenly gravely turn to the others and their human bodies burst open, revealing that they are an ancient race of \\"Crab People\\". Captured by these Crab People (who chant \\"Crab People\\" repeatedly), the gay couple and Kyle are unable to stop the crabs from executing their plans of ruling the earth by destroying the human race (through changing men into metrosexuals) and the Crab People force them to become Crab People instead; however, the wives attack and kill the Queer Eye guys. They explain that men need to be masculine and that is what really makes them attractive, even if they are gross. The Queer Eye producers are about to press charges on the women until they discover that the Fab Five were not human, noting that the Crab People tried this before with The Jeffersons. They decide instead to \\"bring back the Latin fad\\"—which the citizens of South Park slavishly adopt. At school, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman accept Kyle again, but when he expresses his anger that they previously forsook him, the others call him \\"gay\\" and go and play football. He walks away in the opposite direction, but then, he stops and turns around. Production Parker and Stone have since been critical of the third-act twist of \\"crab people\\" and consider the episode one of their worst. Though they brainstormed for hours to improve the episode (after having deleted the initial subplot of Mr. Garrison leading the other gay people in South Park to \\"compete\\" with the metrosexuals), they were unable to come up with anything better than crab people. Executive producer Anne Garefino was particularly critical of the idea, deeming it \\"stupid.\\" Parker later noted that \\"'Crab people' became this thing [in the writers' room]. It's like, you just know there's something better, but you can't think of it, and now you've just got to go with crab people.\\" In the DVD commentary, Stone called Crab People \\"the worst idea we've ever had.\\" Despite Parker and Stone's distaste for the characters, however, the Crab People have actually become fairly popular antagonists with fans of the show. In the episode Quest for Ratings, Eric Cartman suggested Crab People while brainstorming ideas for a news show. They're also mentioned at the end of Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow, where they were blamed for destroying the Beaverton dam. Crab People also appear in the video games The Stick of Truth and The Fractured but Whole.https://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/05/16/south-park-stick-of-truth- sales/ Home release \\"South Park Is Gay!\\", along with the fourteen other episodes from The Complete Seventh Season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006.

He studied in many countries abroad and lived in Paris from 1924 to 1932. His long life's work earned him many recognitions as well as a place in the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti, SANU). Life Milan Konjović finished elementary and secondary school in Sombor between 1904 and 1916. In 1914 he had his first exhibition featuring some fifty works painted in nature. In 1919 he was admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, in the class of Vlaho Bukovac. Having left the Academy after the second semester, he continued his education on his own, in Prague where an avant-garde Czech painter Jan Zrzavý introduced him to the art of Leonardo da Vinci. He later brought his studies to Vienna and traveled to German museums in Munich, Berlin, and Dresden. He arrived in Paris in May 1924 and stayed there until 1932. Afterward, he returned to his native Sombor.Galerija Milan Konjević, Sombor. Globalgreen-so.com. Retrieved on 31 July 2014.SOMBOR IN THE 20TH CENTURY. The City of Sombor. Sombor.org.rs.

He then began producing oil works painted in so-called 'subdued colors' from 1945 to 1952, marking the \\"gray phase\\" of his work. 1953 is considered to be the turning point in Konjović's painting style. He works began to be defined by more pure intensive colors and glow, leading to the period dubbed the \\"coloristic phase.\\" New artistic orientation culminated and was to characterize the works of the \\"associative phase\\" (1960–1984). At that time Milan Konjovic engaged himself in the work of the artists' colonies of Vojvodina. In 1985 began the \\"Byzantine phase\\" with works treating various themes from Byzantine history. By the end of 1990 Konjović had produced about thirty new works, completing the impressive opus of about 6000 oil paintings, pastels, watercolors, temperas, drawings, tapestries, stage sets, costume sketches, stained glass windows, mosaics, and graphics. In his life, Konjović had 297 one-man and 700 group exhibitions in the country and abroad, in such notable locations as Prague, New York, London, Amsterdam, São Paulo, Rome, Modena, Athens, Paris, and Moscow. His legacy is best represented in his hometown of Sombor where the \\"Milan Konjović \\" Gallery,The Gallery 'Milan Konjović (Tuner's House or Gale's House). Sycultour.eu.

In 1986 he became a corresponding member of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, and in 1992 a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In June 2008, an exhibition of the works by Milan Konjović was opened in the Milan Konjović Gallery in Sombor to commemorate 110 years from the birth of the artist. Entitled \\"Milan Konjović: In Defence of the Autonomy of Paintings\\" (Milan Konjović: Odbrana autonomije slike), the exhibition documented Konjović's output in the period of socialist realism, from 1946 until 1951, when \\"Marxist\\" art critics vilified and criticised the artist for (among other things) \\"painting for himself, instead of for the community\\".Odbrana autonomije slike.

He resorted to pastels in the years after World War II, when there was a shortage of oil paints. Later on, he returned to oils, layering them on the surface in thicker layers than ever; this presents quite a challenge when cleaning some of the paintings. The Byzantine phase of his last years is characterised by thinner layers of paint, with patches of unpainted surface. Personal He is related to Brigitte Konjovic, Miss France 1978.

Smith.\\"(2010). Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 2010-09-30. His orders included, \\"kill everyone over the age of ten\\" and make the island \\"a howling wilderness.\\"Miller p. 220; PBS documentary \\"Crucible of Empire\\"; Ten days after President McKinley's death, the residents of Balangiga, a tiny village 400 miles southeast of Manila, attacked the local U.S. garrison. While U.S. soldiers ate breakfast, the church bells rang a signal. Filipinos brandishing machetes emerged from their hiding places. Forty-eight Americans, two-thirds of the garrison, were butchered, in what is called the Balangiga massacre. On the orders of General Jacob H. Smith, U.S. troops retaliated against the entire island (600 square miles) of Samar where Balangiga is located. The exchange is known because of two courts-martial: one of Waller, who was later court-martialed for ordering or allowing the execution of a dozen Filipino bearers, and the other of Gen. Jacob H. Smith, who was actually court-martialed for giving that order. The jury is out to the extent that order was carried out, because Littleton Waller actually countermanded it to his own men and said \\"Captain David Porter, I've had instructions to kill everyone over ten years old. But we are not making war on women and children, only on men capable of bearing arms. Keep that in mind no matter what other orders you receive.\\" Undoubtedly, some men did commit atrocities regardless of Waller's commands. Court-martialed for the incident, he was dubbed \\"Hell Roaring Jake\\" Smith, \\"The Monster\\", and \\"Howling Jake\\" by the press as a result. Civil War and post-bellum Smith enlisted in the Union Army early in the Civil War, but was disabled in the Battle of Shiloh in 1862; he would later receive a brevet promotion to Major in 1867 for his actions. He tried to return to duty that summer, but the wound would not heal properly, so he became a member of the Invalid Corps, serving out the remainder of the Civil War as a mustering officer/recruiter in Louisville for three years. His service record states that he was good at recruiting \\"colored\\" troops. While working in Louisville, he met and later married his first wife Emma L. Haverty on November 10, 1864; they quietly divorced October 1, 1880. After the war, he became a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Wartime misconduct In 1869, Smith's father-in-law Daniel Havrety was being sued for fraud in connection with a bankruptcy. The creditors looked into the assets of Havrety's family, believing Havrety had hidden most of his wealth by transferring it to others. These investigations revealed a tremendous enlargement of Jacob Smith's assets during the war, from $4,000 in 1862 to $40,000 in 1865. Smith was called as a witness in the suit to explain his sudden fortune. Smith claimed ignorance of any fraud on behalf of his father-in-law, and explained that the money was the result of a bounty brokerage scheme. During the war, eastern seaboard states were offering recruits enlistment bonuses (then called \\"bounties\\") of up to $700. Smith, along with a group of eastern recruiters, planned to fill eastern troop quotas using men from the Midwest, paying those recruits the regional bounty of $300 and pocketing the difference. Smith claimed he believed the plan was legal, at first. But before it could get off the ground, Smith took $92,000 the eastern recruiters had deposited for the bounties and used it to make speculative investments in side businesses involving whiskey, gold and diamonds. When the eastern recruiters demanded repayment which Smith could not provide, Smith noticed the recruiters refused to engage the law. From that, he concluded the plot must have been illegal. Eventually Smith's investments produced large profits, and Smith claimed he repaid all of his creditors in full, except for a few who had died or left town.Fritz, p. 187 At the time of the Havrety bankruptcy, Smith had been given a temporary judge advocate assignment with the army that he was attempting to convert into a permanent position. One of the parties in the bankruptcy case informed the Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, Joseph Holt, about Smith's bounty brokerage scheme. Smith wrote a letter to the Holt in response. Smith's letter attempted to cast the scheme in a sympathetic light. He wrapped himself in the flag and argued that he had been in seven engagements and had been wounded in the Battle of Shiloh. He portrayed himself as \\"one who took upon himself all the odium that the rebels and conservatives of Louisville, Kentucky, heaped upon him, by being the first officer, to my knowledge, who commenced mustering into service the colored man in Kentucky during the year 1863.\\" Smith said that he had scoured Kentucky's prison pens, jails, and workhouses to find these men and that his only aim was to serve his God and his country properly. Smith admitted to speculating, but justified it by saying that others had made three times as much money as he had in Louisville during the war, and he had not defrauded anyone. Holt did not accept Smith's excuse, and submitted the papers to the Secretary of War with the recommendation that the matter be given to the United States Senate Committee on Military Affairs, who had the authority to confirm Smith for the permanent position he sought. Smith wrote a more apologetic explanation to the Secretary, painting himself as a gullible dupe. He explained the plot in detail, and argued that his only offense was using other people's money for his own profit. He claimed that all his creditors had been repaid, and no recruits had been defrauded out of their bounty. But conveniently, Smith claimed that all other witnesses to his story had either died or left the country, and that he had destroyed or lost all of his own bank account records for that period. The Secretary found Smith's explanation to be unavailing. Smith's temporary appointment as judge advocate was revoked by the President. In the Judge Advocate General's summation of the events, Holt excoriated Smith for how his own testimony appeared to suggest he believed it was alright to mislead and deceive military auditors. Holt concluded, \\"[b]y his conflicting statements and his unfortunate explanation, he is placed in a dilemma full of embarrassment.\\" Further gaffes In 1877, Smith responded to a written reprimand from his colonel with a disrespectful longhand response. Technically, the colonel could not censure Smith because he had been released from his command because of the incident that was being investigated. When Smith's company was marching away, the colonel indicated his displeasure. Smith's reply made fun of the colonel, saying he was like Prussian general von Moltke. Smith said the colonel's rebuke was like an \\"Irishman who was remonstrated for letting his wife whip him, and answered, 'It is fun for her, and don't hurt me.'\\" The colonel notified Smith there would be a court-martial, and so Smith wrote the colonel a nasty letter. Smith was not court-martialed, and instead Major John Pope lectured Smith and recommended the whole affair be dropped since Smith had apologized. Legal problems During the 1870s, Smith was called away from duty for several lawsuits for debt. One case dragged on in a Chicago court from 1869 to 1883. Another creditor, named Henry, continued a claim against Smith for $7 for payment of a harness. The case dragged on from 1871 to 1901. Henry even sent a letter to President McKinley about Smith and his $7 debt. On July 31, 1884, Smith was sued again in Chicago by the legal firm Pedrick and Dawson. Smith was court martialed in 1885 in San Antonio for \\"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman\\", for deeds in the \\"Mint Saloon\\" in Brackett, Texas. The opposing party claimed Smith had been playing a game of draw poker with M. S. Moore and C. H. Holzy a.k.a. Jiggerty, lost $135 to Moore, and refused to pay the debt. Smith was found guilty and was confined to Fort Clark for a year and forfeited half his pay for the same time period. The Reviewing Authority thought the court was too lenient on Smith. It also felt that Smith's courtroom tactics made a mockery of the legal procedure: * demanding witnesses from distant and impractical locations especially since he never actually used the witnesses in court, * local civilian witnesses for the plaintiff were intimidated so they refused to testify against Smith, * local civilian witnesses for the defense selectively decided which questions they would answer and which they would not. While the draw poker case was still pending in 1885, Smith wrote a letter to the Adjutant General of the Army regarding the case, but many of the statements were lies. Because of this, Smith was tried again in 1886. He was found guilty, and would have been thrown out of the military. Smith was saved by the intercession of President Grover Cleveland, who allowed Smith to return to the military with merely a reprimand. In 1891, Smith was charged with using enlisted men as his servants in his home.Fritz, p. 188-189 Philippine–American War Smith with Major General Adna Chaffee in Tacoblan, Leyte, 1902 Smith was sent to the Philippines during the Philippine–American War. =Smith describes his tactics to the media= In December 1899, Jacob H. Smith (now a colonel) boastingly informed reporters in the Philippines that, because the natives were \\"worse than fighting Indians\\", he had already adopted appropriate tactics that he had learned fighting \\"savages\\" in the American West, without waiting for orders to do so from General Elwell S. Otis. This interview provoked a headline announcing that \\"Colonel Smith of 12th Orders All Insurgents Shot At Hand\\", and the New York Times endorsed Smith's tactics as \\"long overdue.\\"Miller p. 95; Death For Luzon Bandits; Guerrillas Caught by Col. Smith Will Be Shot or Hanged. Criminals Infest the Island Some American Officers Say the Campaign Is Worse Than Fighting Indians. New York Times, December 13, 15, 1899; San Francisco Call, August 28, 1899, January 11, 1900; Boston Evening Transcript, January 12, 1900 =Promotion by William Howard Taft= Because of Smith's during the Spanish–American War, William Howard Taft, who was the civilian governor of the Philippines, decided to promote Smith to Brigadier General with a caveat. Taft wrote that Smith \\"had reached a time when promotion to a Brigadier Generalship would worthily end his services, for I believe it is his intention to retire upon promotion.\\" Smith was promoted, but he decided not to retire. Starting in the late 1880s, the U.S. Army had adopted the system of filling each brigadier general position not by qualifications, but by mere seniority. The system usually gave elderly colonels a few more months, weeks or days of active duty with a new title, followed by nearly immediate retirement at a higher pay rate. Jacob Smith was slightly younger and his promotion to general was made earlier than typical; he had three years left until retirement became mandatory by law.Fritz, p. 190 =Smith causes an uproar in Luzon= Resentment of Spanish Dominican Friars of the Catholic Church were alleged to be the principal cause of the Filipino revolution against Spain, and many friars were killed by the Filipino population. p. 25 American foreign policy was to stay strictly neutral in religious matters. In September 1900, while Smith was the military governor of Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Zambales on Luzon, Smith intervened in a religious dispute in the village of Dagupan. Smith sided with a priest who was friendly with the friars. This caused an angry civilian uproar in central Luzon.Fritz, p. 189 =Samar campaign= On September 28, 1901, fifty-one American soldiers of Company C of the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment who had been stationed in the town of Balangiga, the third largest town on the southern coast of Samar Island, were killed in a surprise guerrilla attack. They had been deployed to Balangiga to close its port and prevent supplies reaching Filipino forces in the interior, which at that time were under the command of General Vicente Lukbán. Lukbán had been sent there in December 1898 to govern the island on behalf of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. The attack provoked shock in the U.S. public, with newspapers equating what they called a \\"massacre\\" to George Armstrong Custer's last stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Major General Adna R. Chaffee, military governor of the Philippines, received orders from President Theodore Roosevelt to pacify Samar. To this end, Chaffee appointed Smith to Samar to accomplish the task. Smith's order \\"Kill Everyone Over Ten\\" became a caption in the New York Journal cartoon on May 5, 1902. The Old Glory draped an American shield on which a vulture replaced the bald eagle. The caption at the bottom proclaimed, \\"Criminals Because They Were Born Ten Years Before We Took the Philippines.\\" Smith's conduct of this campaign eventually resulted in his court-martial. Smith instructed Major Littleton Waller, commanding officer of a battalion of 315 U.S. Marines assigned to bolster his forces in Samar, regarding the conduct of pacification: A march through the island followed. Food and trade to Samar were cut off, intended to starve the revolutionaries into submission. Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction to force the inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans from fear and starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General Vicente Lukbán, but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. Littleton Waller, in a report, stated that over an eleven-day period his men burned 255 dwellings, shot 13 carabaos and killed 39 people. The exact number of Filipino civilians killed by US troops will never be known, but an encyclopedic book on casualties in warfare puts the figure at 2,000; an exhaustive research made by a British writer in the 1990s put the figure at about 2,500; Filipino historians believe it to be around 50,000. The rate of Samar's population growth slowed as refugees fled from Samar to Leyte,US Senate Committee Hearings \\"Affairs in the Philippine Islands\\" Feb 3, 1902, Vol 3, page 2341 yet still the population of Samar increased by 21,456 during the war. A great loss of life is not supported.Bulletin of the American Historical Collection, April–June 2004, Volume XXXII, page 65 The abuses outraged anti-Imperialist groups in the United States when these became known in March 1902. The Judge Advocate General of the Army observed that only the good sense and restraint of the majority of Smith's subordinates prevented a complete reign of terror in Samar. As a consequence of his order in Samar, Smith became known as \\"Howling Wilderness Smith.\\" Smith earned another sobriquet, \\"Hell-Roaring Jake\\" not due to his violence in war, but because of his penchant for making outrageous oaths and the extravagance of his language. =Waller's court-martial= Smith's order was not discovered by superiors or the media at the time it was given. It was only revealed in the course of the court martial of Major Littleton Waller, one of Smith's subordinates, which began on March 17, 1902. Major Waller was being tried for ordering the execution of eleven mutinous Filipino porters.Miller, p. 226-8 Waller did not mention Smith's order in his defense, instead relying on provisions of Civil War General Order Number 100. That General Order, also known as the Lieber Code, dictated how Union soldiers were expected to conduct themselves during wartime, and is considered a precursor to the Geneva Conventions. In contrast to later agreements regarding rules of war, the Lieber Code permitted the killing of POWs in reprisal for violations of the rules of war by the enemy, and called for the summary execution of spies, saboteurs and guerrilla fighters. Waller's counsel had rested his defense. The prosecution decided to call Smith as a rebuttal witness. Smith was not above selling out Waller to save his career. On April 7, 1902, Smith perjured himself again by denying that he had given any special verbal orders to Waller. In response, Waller revealed Smith's order to him and produced three officers who corroborated Waller's version of the Smith–Waller conversation, and copies of every written order he had received from Smith. Waller informed the court he had been directed to take no prisoners and to kill every male Filipino over 10.Miller, p. 230-232; Fritz, p. 189 General Adna Chaffee, military governor of the Philippines, cabled the War Department requesting permission to keep Smith in the islands for a short time, since he feared that Smith, if given the opportunity to talk to reporters, could speak \\"absurdly unwise\\" and might say things contrary to the facts established in the case, \\"or act like an unbalanced lunatic.\\" =Smith's court-martial= In May 1902, Smith faced court-martial for his orders, being tried not for murder or other war crimes, but for \\"conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline\\". The court-martial found Smith guilty and sentenced him \\"to be admonished by the reviewing authority.\\" To ease the subsequent public outcry in America, Secretary of War Elihu Root recommended that Smith be retired. President Roosevelt accepted this recommendation, and ordered Smith's retirement from the Army, with no additional punishment.Morris, Edmund. Theodore Rex. (c) 2001, Random House: p. 127 General J. Franklin Bell was never investigated.Miller, p. 227 (See Littleton Waller) Later life Smith retired to Portsmouth, Ohio, doing some world traveling. He volunteered his military services by letter to the Adjutant General's Office on April 5, 1917, to fight in World War I, but was refused due to old age and because his atrocities in the Philippines had severely tarnished the image and reputation of the U.S. military. Smith died in San Diego on March 1, 1918, and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Battle wounds By his 1902 court-martial, Smith had been wounded in battle three times: *Smith had a scar from a saber cut on the head that he had received in July 1861 in Barboursville, Virginia. *Since April 7, 1862, he had been carrying a Minié ball from the Civil War Battle of Shiloh in his hip. *Smith also had a bullet in his body from a wound at El Caney, Cuba during the Spanish–American War.

Supreme Court Judgment: Tremblay v. DaigleDunsmuir, Mollie. 1991 Reviewed 18 August 1998 Abortion: Constitutional and Legal Developments Library of Parliament, Research Branch, Law and Government Division. Current Issue Review 89-10E. This, in turn, meant that men, while claiming to be protecting fetal rights, cannot acquire injunctions to stop their partners from obtaining abortions in Canada. Background By the time the legal controversy began, Canadian abortion law had already been mostly invalidated, as the Therapeutic Abortion Committees were found unconstitutional under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in R v Morgentaler (1988). That case, however, while finding the committees were unfair to women requiring therapeutic abortions, had not resolved the issue of the status of fetal rights. Tremblay v Daigle thus began with two Quebec individuals named Chantal Daigle and Jean-Guy Tremblay, who were involved in a sexual relationship in 1988 and 1989, with Daigle becoming pregnant in 1989. Tremblay beat Daigle, despite being aware of her pregnancy, and afterwards the relationship came to an end and Daigle developed an interest in obtaining an abortion. Among other things, Daigle cited a desire to raise children in peaceful and stable circumstances, an interest in never seeing Tremblay again, and concern for her own psychological health. In response, Tremblay sought an injunction to halt the abortion, claiming to be protecting the fetus's right to life. Tremblay defended the existence of this fetal right by saying that the fetus is indeed a person. When the case reached the Supreme Court, Daigle left the province for the United States to terminate the pregnancy. Nevertheless, the issue was considered important enough that the Supreme Court declined to set aside the case for mootness. They went on to give a decision, which was unanimous and which vindicated Daigle. Ruling The Court ruled that it was not necessary to deal with the issues of Canadian federalism raised by the appeal; the issue of fetal rights would suffice to solve this particular dispute and prevent similar legal incidents in the future. The fetal rights were said to be anchored in the rights to life in the Canadian Charter, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Civil Code of Quebec. Moreover, it was argued Tremblay had a right to protect his \\"potential progeny.\\" The Supreme Court considered and rejected all these arguments. As the Court noted, its role was to consider the fetus's legal status; it would not rule on its biological status, nor would it enter \\"philosophical and theological debates.\\" As far as the Court could tell, there was no legal precedent for fetal rights under the Quebec Charter, and this Charter is written in \\"very general terms\\" and does not specify whether the rights within it were available to fetuses. Although the Charter does say its rights belong to humans, whether the fetus is a human is a merely \\"linguistic\\" question that would not solve the issue of what the National Assembly of Quebec actually meant in the Charter. Moreover, if the National Assembly had meant for the Quebec Charter to apply to fetuses, it seemed questionable as to why they would not explicitly state this, rather than leave \\"the protection of this right in such an uncertain state.\\" Regarding the Civil Code, the Court considered the argument that since the Code deals with fetuses as \\"juridical\\" persons, fetuses must legally be human beings. Human beings, under the Code, have rights. Once again, the Court expressed skepticism as to the nature of the term \\"human being\\", noting the linguistic nature of the argument. While the Code does give fetuses some similar treatment to legal persons, the Court replied that this does not necessarily imply other fetal rights exist. In the places where fetuses are recognized as juridical persons, the Court claimed this is a \\"fiction of the civil law\\". The case next turned to Canadian law and common law. With some historical review, it was noted that while fetuses have usually had some protection under the law, abortion has not usually been viewed as being comparable to murder. Thus, a fetus is not a person under common law. The Court also declined to address the question of fetal rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, noting that the Charter applies to government; it has no force in legal disputes between private citizens, which was the case in Tremblay v Daigle. Finally, the Court ruled that there was no precedent for men's rights to protect their \\"potential progeny.\\" Aftermath Some scholars have noted that along with Borowski v Canada (AG) (1989), Tremblay v Daigle \\"closed off litigation opportunities by anti-abortion opponents\\" of pro-abortion rights Canadians.Christopher P. Manfredi; Scott Lemieux, \\"Judicial Discretion and Fundamental Justice: Sexual Assault in the Supreme Court of Canada,\\" The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 47, No. 3. (Summer, 1999), p. 500. Another scholar notes that this case, along with the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's Borowski decision and the Supreme Court case R v Sullivan (1991), all probably indicate the fetus is not a person under the Canadian Charter.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), 743. A comparable result to Daigle occurred in 1999 in Dobson (Litigation guardian of) v Dobson.Rand Dyck, Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches, 3d ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000, page 437. In 2000, Tremblay was convicted of two counts of assault in the violent beating of his former girlfriend and her close friend which had taken place the year before in Calgary, Alberta. He was sentenced to five years in prison plus a ten-year supervision order. Tremblay took his fight against the supervision order to the Supreme Court, but the Court decided against hearing his appeal in 2005. At the time it was revealed that he had been convicted of 14 attacks on women, most of whom were his former girlfriends. In 2004, the National Parole Board declined to name him a dangerous offender.CBC News, \\"Top court won't hear repeat abuser's bid,\\" Last Updated Thu, 21 Apr 2005 11:56:28 EDT, URL accessed 22 August 2006.

She was the first public topless dancer. In 1964 Doda made international news, first by dancing topless at the city's Condor Club, then by enhancing her bust from size 34 to 44 through silicone injections. Her breasts became known as Doda's \\"twin 44s\\" and \\"the new Twin Peaks of San Francisco\\". Early life Carol Ann Doda was born August 29, 1937, in Vallejo, California, and grew up in San Francisco. Her mother's maiden name was Hoss. Her parents divorced when she was three, and Doda dropped out of school and became a cocktail waitress at age 14.

(In 1983 Assistant Manager James \\"Jimmy the Beard\\" Ferrozzo was crushed to death by the hydraulic piano while lying atop his naked stripper girlfriend, Theresa Hill. Image 5 of 8.) From the waist up Doda emulated aquatic movements like the front crawl. She also performed the Twist, The Frug, and the Watusi.\\"Topless Craze in S.F. – It's a Jungle of Sweaty Gyrations\\", Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1965, Page C11. On June 19, 1964, when Doda was 26 years old, the Condor's publicist, \\"Big\\" Davy Rosenberg gave Doda a \\"monokini\\" topless swimsuit designed by Rudi Gernreich. She performed topless that night, the first noted entertainer of the era to do so. The act was an instant success. Two months after she started her semi-nude performances, the rest of San Francisco's Broadway was topless, followed soon after by entertainers across America. Doda became an American cultural icon of the 1960s. The Republican National Convention was held in San Francisco, during the summer of 1964; many of the delegates came to see Carol Doda. She was profiled in Tom Wolfe's 1969 book The Pump House Gang and appeared that same year as Sally Silicone in Head, the 1968 film created by Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson, and featuring The Monkees. The movie was produced by Columbia Pictures.\\"Movie Call Sheet\\", Los Angeles Times, March 11, 1968, Page C32. She appeared in a Golden Boy parody with Annette Funicello, Sonny Liston, and Davy Jones.\\"Monkees Cavort In 'Head' at the Vogue\\", Los Angeles Times, November 20, 1968, Page G18. Encouraged by her success, Doda soon decided to enhance her breasts with silicone injections, going from size 34 to 44. Doda became renowned for her big bust, and was one of the first well-known performers to have her breasts artificially enhanced. She had 44 injections, a large dose of silicone, at a cost of . For the topless and waterless Swim, Doda wore the bottom half of a black bikini and a net top which ended where a bathing suit generally began. She performed 12 shows nightly so the management could keep crowds moving in and out. A large illuminated sign in front of the club featured a cartoon of her with red flashing lights representing her nipples. In Yosemite National Park, Doda Dome was named for her.

Court appearances  On April 22, 1965 Doda was arrested along with Pete Mattioli and Gino del Prete, owners of the Condor Club. They were cleared when two judges instructed not-guilty verdicts. Judge Friedman's memorandum to opposing attorneys reads, \\"Whether acts ... are lewd and dissolute depends not on any individual's interpretation or personal opinion, but on the consensus of the entire community ...\\" Doda and del Prete were arrested during police raids to stop bare-bosom shows in North Beach.\\"Topless Suits in Shows OK\\", Los Angeles Times, May 8, 1965, Page 9. Peter Mattioli owned the Condor Club by 1967 and Doda still appeared in shows there.\\"S.F. Pair Plan Topless Club\\", Los Angeles Times, April 19, 1967, Page D15. Doda was a witness during the trial of two all-nude dancers who were arrested for \\"indecent exposure and lewd and dissolute conduct\\", in 1969. The defendants were dancers at the Pink Pussy Kat in Orangevale, California. Presiding Municipal Court Judge Earl Warren Jr. moved the trial, temporarily, from the courtroom to Chuck Landis Largo club. There Doda performed to live song and dance numbers, along with a movie titled Guru You. She was cross-examined by a deputy district attorney about what she hoped to convey to audiences in her act. Doda was dressed in a red miniskirt with dark blue piping and beige boots. She responded that the movie represents \\"a satire of pornography ... it's to show people the humorous side of sex\\". Several members of the 10-man, 2-woman jury kept in check their smiles as Doda explained the 17-minute movie. The deputy district attorney opposed asking her to perform, considering it irrelevant to the case. He was overruled by Warren.\\"Judge Takes Another Look At 'Dodo's Indecent Dance'\\", Long Beach Press-Telegram, September 23, 1969, Page 32. Later career From the late-1960s through the late-1970s, Doda was the spokesmodel for what is now the San Jose, California television station KICU-TV Channel 36, then known as KGSC-TV. Filmed from the waist up and wearing clothes which amplified her most prominent physical attributes, she became known for saying \\"You're watching the Perfect 36 in San Jose.\\" She would also occasionally appear on-air to do a double entendre laced editorial commentary on the issues of the day. \\"Carol Doda; the Perfect 36 (Channel 36's editorial voice and figure) has been in for dinner several times recently.\\" In 1982 Doda was again dancing at the Condor three times a night. She was 45 and performed to rock 'n' roll, blues, and ragtime. Each act was the same, with Doda appearing in a gold gown, traditional elbow-length gloves, and a diaphanous wraparound. Her clothing was removed until she wore only a g-string and the diaphanous wraparound. In the final portion she was attired in only the wraparound. Her small body looked slimmer without clothes, a perception which was emphasized by the dwarfing effect of her breasts. At the time she was taking dance and voice lessons but had no definite plans for her future. During the 1980s, Doda performed throughout Bay Area dance night clubs with her band The Lucky Stiffs. Doda retired from stripping in the 1980s and subsequently ran Carol Doda's Champagne and Lace Lingerie Boutique, a lingerie shop in San Francisco. As of 2009, one could be sure to find Doda on any given evening at Gino & Carlo bar in North Beach. She also had been performing clothed for several years at several San Francisco North Beach bars and clubs, including Gino & Carlo, Amante's and Enrico's Supper Club. Personal life On November 9, 2015, Doda died of kidney failure at St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco after a long stay. Doda said she was never married. While very young, she gave birth to two children with whom she had little contact: daughter Donna Smith Terzian, who predeceased her, and son Tom Smith.

Prior to his television career he owned The Fox Inn, a bar in Santa Monica, California, where he performed nightly from 1961 to 1989. At the end of the night, the crowd would start chanting, \\"On your head! On your head!\\" He would carefully fold a towel, put it on the floor, stand on his head, and then drink a beer while upside down faster than anyone could drink one standing up. The Fox also spent time playing on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's campus between 1972-1987. He regularly chugged beers on campus while playing his piano and singing, long before alcohol consumption laws were ever enforced on campus.

Barilli; ; 5 November 1909 – 6 March 1945) was a Serbian painter and poet. She is the most notable female artist of Serbian modernism. Biography Her Italian father, Bruno Barilli, was an influential composer. Her Serbian mother, Danica Pavlović-Barili, a descendant of the Karađorđević dynasty, was a lady in waiting to Queen Maria of Yugoslavia and was tasked with improving her Serbian language. She was also superintendent at the court of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who was her second cousin once removed. Danica also had artistic talent and studied art in Munich, where she met her husband Bruno Barilli in 1905, whom she married in an Orthodox ceremony 4 years later in the city of Pozarevac. Milena herself studied at the Royal School of Arts in Belgrade, Serbia (1922–1926) and in Munich (1926–1928). In the early 1930s, she left Serbia and returned only for brief visits until the outbreak of World War II. During her stays in Spain, Rome, Paris and London, where she socialised with Jean Cocteau and André Breton, she was influenced by many western schools and artists, notably Giorgio de Chirico. After 1939, she lived and worked in New York where her career peaked as an illustrator for Vogue,https://fashionheritage.eu/from-serbia-to-the- world-fashion-illustrations-of-milena-pavlovic-barilli/ Harper's Bazaar, and other publications under the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. In 1941, she appeared in the Twentieth Annual of Advertising Art, and before her death, she was commissioned to design costumes for Gian Carlo Menotti's ballet Sebastian and a production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream; these were never completed. She died in a horse-riding accident at the age of 35. She was cremated, according to her American husband's wishes, and buried in a cemetery in Rome. Her envelope-pushing and taboo-breaking work graced galleries all over the world, her ideas sitting at the forefront of the surrealist movement. Pavlović-Barili's works in the Milena Pavlović-Barili Gallery in Požarevac The topics of her work varied from portraits to imaginative interpretations of biblical stories. The motifs often included dream-like situations, veils, angels, statues of Venus goddess, and Harlequins. Many of her works are parts of permanent exhibitions in Rome, New York City, Museum of Contemporary Art (Belgrade), and her hometown of Požarevac, where the house in which she was born has been converted into a museum in her honor. In 1943, Pavlović-Barili's work was included in Peggy Guggenheim's show Exhibition by 31 Women at the Art of This Century gallery in New York.

The film suffered a difficult production due to Sellers's erratic behavior and was not theatrically released. Medak described the film as \\"the biggest disaster of my life\\" in 2016. The script was written by Evan Jones and Ernest Tidyman (uncredited) with additional dialogue by Spike Milligan. The film was produced by Thomas Clyde and Gareth Wigan with cinematography by Michael Reed and Larry Pizer. The title and some of the plot details are based on the book of the same title by Newbery Medal-winning children's author Sid Fleischman. Plot In the seventeenth century, pirate captain Ras Mohammed (Peter Boyle), accompanied by his incompetent Irish cook Dick Scratcher (Peter Sellers) and three crewmen, buries three chests of treasure on an unnamed island. Scratcher then kills the captain and three crewmen. He returns to the pirate ship and proclaims himself the new captain as only he knows the location of the treasure. He soon discovers his predecessor's treasure map was drawn in disappearing ink. Fourteen years later, the pirate ship reaches Ireland, although Scratcher believes they are on a Greek island. The crew behaves gluttonously, with the exception of the debonair and cerebral Pierre Rodriquez (Anthony Franciosa). They abduct an Irish boy, Jeremiah (Richard Willis), whom Scratcher believes can see ghosts and will therefore be able to contact Ras Mohammed's ghost for directions to the treasure. After seeing off the British Navy by posing as Portuguese fishermen suffering the \\"red plague\\", the pirates sail to Algiers, where Jeremiah is taken prisoner. The pirates encounter Scratcher's old friend Billy Bombay (Spike Milligan) and later release Jeremiah. After threats of mutiny by a pirate named Abdullah (Thomas Baptiste), the pirates end up back at the island of buried treasure. They dig up Billy Bombay's treasure chest of silver cannonballs and fire them at Billy Bombay and his six brothers, leaving only Billy alive. Separately, Pierre, Jeremiah and Abdullah discover Ras Mohammed's treasure. The film ends with Scratcher buried up to his neck in sand, while Billy Bombay is tied to a tree, and the two shout insults at each other. Style The film's opening seven- minute prologue is shot in the style of a black and white silent movie, complete with caption cards. Sellers' onetime Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan appears halfway through the film and worked on revisions to the script. This results in some Goonish style banter and effects, such as undercranked film sequences making movement seem faster, dialogue and sound effects. When Scratcher and Billy Bombay meet, Milligan says to camera, \\"It's that smelly old sea-goon, Dick Scratcher\\" - an apparent reference to The Goon Show character Ned Seagoon.

Peter Sellers arrived on location displaying strange behaviour, attributed to the end of his relationship with Liza Minnelli. Shortly after filming began, Sellers began to lose confidence in the project and when Spike Milligan arrived to shoot his scenes, Sellers asked him to assess the footage that had been shot thus far. Milligan looked at the rushes and said \\"this is on a disaster course\\". He outlined his ideas to Medak and Sellers, who approved. Milligan rewrote the script. But Sellers did not turn up for the first day of filming the new scenes, claiming he was too ill to work. He decided a vase in his Swiss home might be facing the wrong way so he sent his secretary to Gstaadt to take the vase back to London. Once this was done, Sellers agreed to resume shooting. Medak shot film around Sellers. He liked Milligan's script changes and wanted Milligan to film during the day and rewrite at night. Milligan was reluctant so Sellers tried to get production shut down. Medak refused.'Pete was insane and evil. Spike was slightly touched but with a heart of gold. I loved them both' Farnes, Norma. The Guardian 3 Nov 2003: 2.2. Sellers subsequently became deliberately uncooperative and would often pretend to be sick. On one occasion he was rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack, only for Medak to spot newspaper photographs of Sellers dining with Princess Margaret in London two days later. Sellers caused further upset by agreeing to shoot a cigarette commercial during one of the few off-days in the filming schedule, drafting in an unwilling Peter Medak to direct it, and then on the day refusing to be filmed holding the cigarette packet because he claimed to be the chairman of the Anti-Smoking League.Farnes, Norma (2004).

Sellers had personally invited British cinematographer Larry Pizer to shoot the film, only to later fire him after a party once production had commenced. Sellers also fought on set with co-star Tony Franciosa. \\"It's all kind of bewildering,\\" said Franciosa during filming. \\"Half the time I'm not actually sure what anyone's trying to do. Some of this comedy is so way out I couldn't begin to describe it. But I'll say this: it's an experience.\\" \\"As an artist, he was a genius,\\" said Medak of Sellers. \\"As a person, he was insane. He was depressed in real life, like the typical comedian who under the surface is suicidal... He was incredibly manipulative. He created situations where there was tremendous confusion and then he'd gain the upper hand. He destroyed the whole film... On a good day he was sensational but his moods changed. He couldn't remember what he'd said to you days before. But I remember, working with him, there were moments when it was heaven.

After the final scene was filmed, involving Sellers and Milligan both being physically restrained, the crew forced them to listen to a song detailing the production's woes. Release Medak says after he attended a private screening with Sellers and Milligan: “We all just wanted to kill ourselves.” The film was shot in 1973 and has a copyright notice in the opening credits for 1974. Columbia Pictures deemed the film not worthy of cinematic release. \\"Even Peter Sellers was bad in it,\\" said Fleischman later.Books for Youngsters Not Child's Play to Author: [Home Edition] PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN. Los Angeles Times 26 July 1987: 1. According to Medak, Sellers wanted to buy back the film from Columbia, and for the director and Milligan to redo the narration and re-edit the film for Sellers to get it released. But then Sellers called and said, \\"I can’t buy back the film because it’s been written up for twice as much as it cost.\\" It was ultimately released on Betamax and VHS home video in 1985, and on DVD in 2016. The Ghost of Peter Sellers In 2016, it was announced that Peter Medak was directing a feature-length documentary about the ill-fated production, called The Ghost of Peter Sellers. The film originated with Paul Iacovou, Managing Director of Vegas Media in Cyprus, who got Medak involved. It was due for release in 2017, but the release date was pushed back to 2018.

It contains works by St. Augustine, St. Jerome, and Commodianus.  Contents  The works by Augustine included in this manuscript are De vera religione (folios 1r - 63r), De utilitate credendi (folios 63v - 95r), Soliloquia (folios 96r - 135v), De divinatione demonum (folios 135v - 147v) and Epistle ad Alypium episcopum Tagastensium (folios 175v -182r). The first three of these have sections of Augustine's Retractationes as prologues. Also included in the manuscript are three letters addressed to St Boniface and attributed to Augustine; Domino sublimi semperque magnifico (folio 95r), Domino merito honorabili (folio 95v) and Ego quos diligo (folio 95v). Migne labeled these letters spurious in the Patrologia Latina. The works by Jerome included in this manuscript are a portion of Liber contra Joannem Hierosolymitanum (folios 147v - 170r) and Epistle ad Evangelum Presbyterum de Melchisedech (folios 170v - 175v). The manuscript also includes the Carmen Apologeticum of Commodianus (182r- 197r). This is the only surviving manuscript to contain this work.  Codicology  The manuscript has 202 vellum folios (numbered I-V and 1-197) that measure 275 mm. by 180 mm. The folios generally are in gatherings of 8 leaves each. The binding is a modern binding of white pigskin. The script is a pre-Carolingian minuscule from Northern Italy. There are a few decorated initials. Titles were added in the 9th century in a hand from the Abbey of St Silvester at Nonantola. Folios I-III are palimpsests and originally contained the Latin translation made by Mutianus Scholasticus of John Chrysostom's homilies on the Epistle to the Hebrews written in a late 7th century uncial script.  Provenance  By the 9th century, this manuscript was at Nonantola. It is also possible that it was produced there. It was included in inventories of the manuscripts at Nonantola made in 1331, 1464 and 1490. It was taken from Nonantola, along with 53 other manuscripts, to the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome by Abbot Hilarion Rancati. Sometime between 1798 and 1818 it, along with 34 other manuscripts, disappeared from Santa Croce. It was bought by Sir Thomas Phillipps in 1848 from a London bookseller. It was bought from the Phillipps library by Alfred Chester Beatty in 1924. It was sold to Wilfred Merton in 1933, from whom it was acquired by the British Library.

Starring Sellers, Nadia Gray and Leo McKern, as well as Herbert Lom. His son Michael Sellers plays in the film in the role of Gaston. The film is based on the eponymous play by Marcel Pagnol. Out of distribution for many years, a print exists in the British Film Institute National Archive, which makes it available for viewing on their website. The film was shown during the 2003 Cardiff Independent Film Festival. It was released on Blu-ray and DVD on 15 April 2019 by BFI. Plot Mr. Topaze (Peter Sellers) is an unassuming school teacher in an unassuming small French town who is honest to a fault. He is fired when he refuses to give a passing grade to a bad student, the grandson of a wealthy Baroness (Martita Hunt). Castel Benac (Herbert Lom), a government official who runs a crooked financial business on the side, is persuaded by his mistress, Suzy (Nadia Gray), a musical comedy actress, to hire Mr. Topaze as the front man for his business. Gradually, Topaze becomes a rapacious financier who sacrifices his honesty for success and, in a final stroke of business bravado, fires Benac and acquires Suzy in the deal. An old friend and colleague, Tamise (Michael Gough) questions him and tells Topaze that what he now says and practices indicates there are no more honest men.

Lewis's fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia. He is the main antagonist in the book Prince Caspian, and is the uncle of the book's protagonist. Miraz is the false king of Narnia, having killed his brother, Caspian IX, in order to assume the throne just after the birth of his nephew. The relationship between Miraz and his brother's son, Prince Caspian, resembles that of Claudius and Hamlet in Shakespeare's play Hamlet, as well as Pelias and Jason from Greek mythology. Miraz, a descendant of the Telmarines who had invaded Narnia hundreds of years before, is a cruel and unpopular ruler. Most notorious for banning the teaching of Narnia's pre-Telmarine history, he also levies high taxes and enacts harsh laws. He initially tolerates Caspian as his heir, taking the title of \\"Lord Protector\\" for himself, before ascending the throne while Caspian is a small child. Many years later, his wife, Prunaprismia, bears a son. Miraz is then ready to kill Caspian too, in order to clarify the succession. Caspian, warned in the nick of time by his tutor, flees Miraz's Castle and forms an alliance with the \\"Old Narnians\\", after three of them rescue him after he is knocked out in a fall from his horse. Caspian's horse heads back to his stable at Miraz's castle, causing Miraz to send his army out to track down Caspian. Civil war ensues, culminating in Peter Pevensie defeating Miraz in a duel. Miraz is then killed in an act of treachery by his counselor Lord Glozelle (planned by him and Lord Sopespian), as an act of revenge for Miraz branding him a \\"coward\\" saying that he was talking \\"like an old woman\\" when suggesting reasons not to fight King Peter.

The teams were: *(1) New York Yankees (Eastern Division champion, 103–58) vs. (4) Anaheim Angels (Wild Card, 99–63): Angels win series, 3–1. *(2) Oakland Athletics (Western Division champion, 103–59) vs. (3) Minnesota Twins (Central Division champion, 94–67): Twins win series, 3–2. The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage (Games 1, 2 and 5 at home), which was determined by playing record. The Yankees were not required to make up one remaining game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, potentially allowing the Athletics to tie them for the best record, because they had a 5–4 advantage over Oakland in head-to-head play and thus would win the tiebreaker for home field advantage through the playoffs. The Division Series saw the wild card-qualifying Angels beat the defending league champion Yankees, and the Twins defeat the Athletics in a startling upset. The Angels and Twins went on to meet in the AL Championship Series (ALCS).

It was Sellers' last commercial success for several years. Plot Robert Danvers is a vain, womanizing and wealthy host of a high- profile television cooking show. He meets Marion, a no-nonsense 19-year-old American hippie who has just broken up with her British rock musician boyfriend Jimmy. After a halting start, they begin an affair, and she accompanies him on a trip to a wine-tasting festival in France, where she embarrasses him by getting extremely drunk, but they enjoy their time together on the coast in the South of France. However, when they return to London, Marion makes up with Jimmy and turns down a desperate proposal of marriage from Danvers. Throughout the film, Danvers' favourite line with women is: \\"My God, but you're lovely\\"—which, in the final scene after Marion has gone back to Jimmy and Danvers has made a date with another woman, he says to his own reflection. Cast * Peter Sellers as Robert Danvers * Goldie Hawn as Marion * Tony Britton as Andrew Hunter * Nicky Henson as Jimmy * Diana Dors as John's wife * Judy Campbell as Lady Heather * John Comer as John, the porter * Gabrielle Drake as Julia * Nicola Pagett as Clare * Geraldine Sherman as Caroline * Thorley Walters as Manager of the Carlton Hotel * Ruth Trouncer as Gilly Hunter * Françoise Pascal as Paola * Christopher Cazenove as Nigel * Raf De La Torre as Monsieur Le Guestier Production The film is based on the stage comedy There's A Girl In My Soup, written by Terence Frisby, produced by Michael Codron, directed by Bob Chetwyn and starring Donald Sinden, Barbara Ferris and Jon Pertwee. It ran for six and a half years in the West End, from 1966 to 1973, including three years at the Globe Theatre (now The Gielgud), breaking records to become London's longest-running comedy. This record was later broken by No Sex Please, We're British and then Run for Your Wife. Film rights were bought in 1967 by Columbia and Nat Cohen. Eventually Mike Frankovich became producer and the Boultings directed. Goldie Hawn signed in January 1969. The movie introduced Christopher Cazenove, who later co-starred on Dynasty, and Nicola Pagett, who played Elizabeth Bellamy on Upstairs, Downstairs. It was one of a series of support roles from Diana Dors that revived the latter's career. A novelisation of the film, written by Raymond Hitchcock, was published in 1971. Reception =Box office= There's a Girl in My Soup ranked as the seventh film in takings at the British box office in 1970. =Critical response= Variety found the film \\"a delightful surprise: a rather simple legit sex comedy (by Terence Frisby) transformed into breezy and extremely tasteful screen fun\\"; Roger Greenspun in The New York Times, dismissed the film as \\"without illumination or wit or good humor or good sense\\", and concluded \\"The only performance to praise is that of Tony Britton, who, as Danvers's very much married publisher and friend, achieves a level of sophisticated pleasantness that actually, suggests comedy. Peter Sellers, on the other hand, is at his least inventive. And Goldie Hawn, who I think might be fun in another part, mostly indulges in bad habits with her too-expressive eyes. In fairness, both Miss Hawn and Mr. Sellers are handicapped by roles in which any attempt at a characterization must seem an imposition.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and wrote that Sellers had \\"his first decent role in several years\\" and gave a \\"completely sympathetic performance\\", but \\"no amount of humor is able to wake up the film's tired story premise.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 29, 1970). \\"Girl in My Soup\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 3. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times was positive, writing \\"Escapist entertainment it assuredly is, yet Frisby has wisely provided enough quiet moments between his gags to allow his characters to become real enough to care about.\\"Thomas, Kevin (December 15, 1970). \\"Sellers, Goldie in 'Soup'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that Sellers was \\"hopelessly miscast\\" and that the film \\"would have been much better served by a straight romantic lead.\\" The website Allmovie comments that \\"Soup was different in its day, as the heroine of the piece was not a Doris Day-type eternal virgin, but a sexual being who not only gives herself freely to a man but is upfront and unapologetic about her willingness. The movie has little going for it beyond this premise, and it wanders rather aimlessly, if agreeably, before abruptly resolving its insignificant conflicts.\\" =Awards= Frisby's script won The Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award for Best Screenplay in 1970. Goldie Hawn was nominated for Best Actress at the BAFTA's for her work in this and Cactus Flower.

It is the tale of an older man (Sellers) who blackmails an attractive young woman (Cusack) into spending a week with him in his flat in London. His hope is that she will forget her crooked fiancé and fall in love with him instead.HOFFMAN Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 37, Iss. 432, (Jan 1, 1970) p. 156. It contains one of Sellers' rare 'straight' performances. Plot Telling her fiancé Tom she has to spend a week with her sick grandmother, Janet instead goes to the flat of Hoffman, a recently divorced executive in the firm where she works whom she hardly knows. Her visit is not voluntary, since Hoffman claims to have evidence that could send Tom to jail and has blackmailed her into spending the week with him. While full of desire for the young woman, he is also still bitter about women and, without pressuring her physically, bullies her psychologically. Young and inexperienced, she eventually begins to fight back and even starts some sexual provocation and then insults Hoffman when he does not respond. They are then interrupted when Tom comes looking for his missing fiancée, having been prompted by an 'anonymous' phone call actually made by Hoffman, and Janet leaves with Tom. Discussing the situation, Tom and his mother ask Janet to go back to Hoffman and continue being nice to him in order to keep Tom out of jail. Dismayed that both of them are more concerned for themselves than for her, she goes back to Hoffman and negotiates the terms to agree to his invitation to be his permanent companion.

It was well received and won an international Emmy.JUDY CORNWELL on television Reynolds, Stanley. The Guardian 29 Apr 1968 p. 7. Gebler turned the story into a novel, Shall I Eat You Now?, published the following year.Obituary: Ernest Gebler: No saint in Ireland Pine, Richard. The Guardian 24 February 1998 p. 16. Development Producer Ben Arbeid optioned the screen rights to the novel and hired Gebler to write the script for a fee of ₤21,000. The film was one of the first greenlit by Bryan Forbes while he was head of EMI Films. Forbes arranged for Peter Sellers to star. Sellers met up with Rakoff, and the star decided he did not want to work with the director. However, Forbes insisted that Rakoff stay on the film and Sellers agreed to work with him. \\"Then we got on like a house on fire,\\" said Rakoff.Sikov p. 303 Filming Director Alvin Rakoff says Sellers originally wanted to play the role comically, with an Austrian accent. The director persuaded him to play it straight, but says Sellers then \\"went the other way -- his Hoffman is dark and slow. I kept trying to get Peter to do it faster but he wouldn't. He argued for this brooding quality.\\"Lewis p. 315 The film was shot in the autumn of 1969. There were seven weeks shooting at Elstree Studios with a week on location at Thames Embankment and Wimbledon Common.Sikov p. 302 Reportedly, Sellers despised Hoffman because the lead character too closely reflected his own personality. Arbeid said \\"Benjamin Hoffman is very lonely, very insecure, very self deprecating; and these were all terms used by people to describe the real Sellers. So there was much of the character already in the actor... He had to play the internel self that wasn't there to begin with. He couldn't rely on mimicry, and he went through the torture of not knowing who Hoffman was because he didn't know who he was.\\"Lewis p. 314-315 Rakoff says Sellers and Cusack had a short, intense affair during filming.Sikov p. 303 The film experienced trouble being passed by the censor but was ultimately given an AA rating. Sellers Attempts to Suppress Film According to Bryan Forbes, who was head of the studio that financed the film, Sellers went through a depressive phase after filming was completed and he asked to buy back the negative and remake the movie.

Her actions proved inspiring to the defenders, who flew the flag the next daybreak in front of thousands of watching eyes across the bank of the Suzhou Creek. Personal life Yang had studied physical education in Shanghai and was a member of the Girl Scouts when the war broke out. Her courageous action during the Defense of Sihang Warehouse made her famous. In 1938, she was sent overseas to raise support and spoke about China's struggle in a number of countries. Her efforts were memorialized in the 1938 film Eight Hundred Heroes, but Yang objected to some of the ways in which the film exaggerated her action for dramatic effect. After the Chinese Civil War, Yang followed the Chiang Kai-shek government to Taiwan. She married National Taiwan University professor of physical education Zhu Chongming (朱重明) and had two sons, Zhu Fugui (朱復圭) and Zhu Fuhong (朱復轟). She worked as a physical education teacher in Taipei. The sons were not aware of their mother's war effort when they studied her role in grade school lessons. Yang died of a stroke March 9, 1992 at the age of 78.

Political activism David Bender's five-decade career as a political activist began at the age of twelve when he took a \\"leave of absence\\" from the seventh grade to become a full-time volunteer in the presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Four years later, as a high school reporter, Mr. Bender covered the presidential campaigns of Richard Nixon, George McGovern and Hubert Humphrey. He was literally a \\"boy on the bus,\\" traveling in the company of such journalistic legends as Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid. Later, he became a key aide to the legendary liberal activist Allard K. Lowenstein, the former New York congressman who was a pivotal figure in both the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War movement. He would go on to serve on the national field staffs of California Governor Jerry Brown’s 1976 presidential campaign and on Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s 1980 presidential campaign. When John F. Kennedy, Jr. launched his political and cultural magazine, George, in 1995, he chose David Bender as its first West Coast contributing editor. Citing Mr. Bender's years of experience in politics, government, media and entertainment, Kennedy said, \\"As long as I've known David Bender, he has been involved in public issues. I think what he's been able to do, rather uniquely, is kind of meld a lot of different worlds and channel them into public issues, whether it be Washington, New York or Los Angeles – particularly within the entertainment industry. I can't really think of anyone who has done it longer or as well as he.\\" Air America Bender had a show called Politically Direct on Air America Radio, on which he would converse with political and media influentials such as Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Al Gore and Gore Vidal on progressive issues and the 2008 elections. Politically Direct briefly held a weekly time slot, after which Bender voluntarily ended the program in May 2007 to later join Air America's Ring of Fire as one of three co-hosts. Bender joined The Rachel Maddow Show as a regular contributor and she dubbed him my political guru. in March 2008, as part of that show's expansion to three hours, Bender frequently guest-hosted the show as well. On Sunday, June 21, 2009, he announced that Politically Direct was ending the following week. This was his own decision, as he subsequently announced that he was resuming his writing career. He left the door open for a return to broadcasting and Air America at some point in the future. Writing career In 2000, with musician David Crosby, Mr. Bender co-authored a book and co-produced a four-hour documentary series, Stand And Be Counted, which recounts. the history of artist activism on social and political issues. It features over forty original interviews ranging from Pete Seeger and Joan Baez to Willie Nelson and Sir Elton John. David Bender was the research editor for I Am Spartacus, actor/producer Kirk Douglas’ 2012 account of making the film that broke the Hollywood blacklist. That same year he returned to broadcasting on the Progressive Voices Network as host of the eponymous, THE DAVID BENDER SHOW. . In 2018, Mr. Bender co-authored THE DEAN, the autobiography of the nation's longest serving member of Congress, the late John D. Dingell, Jr. of Michigan.

The film stars Catriona MacColl, Paolo Malco, Ania Pieroni, Giovanni Frezza, Silvia Collatina and Dagmar Lassander. Its plot revolves around a series of murders taking place in a New England home–a home which happens to be hiding a gruesome secret within its basement walls.  Plot  A woman (Daniela Doria) is in an abandoned house looking for her boyfriend. After she discovers his body stabbed with scissors, she is stabbed in the head with a French knife, and her body is dragged through a cellar door. In New York City, Bob (Giovanni Frezza) and his parents, Norman and Lucy Boyle (Paolo Malco and Catriona MacColl), are moving into the same house. Norman's ex-colleague, Dr. Peterson, who murdered his mistress before committing suicide, was the previous owner. The Boyles are to stay there, whilst Norman researches old houses. As his mother packs, Bob looks at a photograph of a house and notices a girl in it. In New Whitby, Boston, Bob waits in his parents' car while they collect the house keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae (Silvia Collatina), whom only Bob can see, warns him to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Gittleson (Dagmar Lassander) is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple \\"the Freudstein keys\\". She insists it is called \\"Oak Mansion\\", and promises to find the Boyles a babysitter. Oak Mansion is in a poor state of repair. The cellar door is locked and nailed shut. A woman arrives and introduces herself as Ann, the babysitter (Ania Pieroni). That night, Norman hears noises and finds Ann unblocking the cellar door. The next day, Norman goes to the library to peruse Peterson's materials. The chief librarian, Mr. Wheatley (Carlo De Mejo), appears to recognize him. but Norman claims he is mistaken. The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas (Giampaolo Saccarola), then informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data. Mae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked \\"Mary Freudstein\\" and says she is not really buried there. Indoors, Lucy finds the tombstone of \\"Jacob Tess Freudstein\\" while sweeping the hallway. When Norman returns, he reassures her that some older houses have indoor tombs because of the hard wintry ground. Norman opens the cellar door and walks down the stairs, only to be attacked by a bat, which won't let go until he stabs it repeatedly. Spooked, the family drives down to the real estate office and demands to be re-housed, but are told it will be a few more days before they can move. While the Boyles are at hospital to treat Norman's injuries from the bat, Mrs. Gittleson arrives at the house to tell them of a new property. Letting herself in, she stands over the Freudstein tombstone, which cracks apart, pinning her ankle. A figure emerges, stabs her in the neck with a fireplace poker, and drags her into the cellar. The next morning, Lucy finds Ann cleaning a bloodstain on the kitchen floor. Ann eludes Lucy's questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he's discovered that Freudstein was a Victorian surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman visits the library and finds an audio cassette of Peterson's, which documents Peterson's increasing madness and reveals what he discovered about Freudstein. Norman destroys the cassette by dropping it into a furnace pipe. At the house, Ann goes to the cellar looking for Bob and hears childlike sobbing sounds. Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat. Bob sees Ann's head, and exits screaming. Lucy returns to find Bob crying in his room, but refuses to believe Bob's account about Ann. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Ann but gets locked in. Lucy hears Bob's cries and tries to open the cellar door. When she cannot open it, Norman returns and hacks the door with a hatchet. The rotting right hand of Freudstein (Giovanni De Nava) appears and restrains Bob against the door as the hatchet chops through it. One of Norman's axe blows through the door severs the ghoul's seemingly normal left hand, and he staggers back down the stairs. Norman and Lucy finally get into the cellar, which contains several mutilated bodies (including Ann, Mrs. Gittleson, and the couple from the beginning of the film), surgical equipment, and a slab. Freudstein is a living corpse with rotting flesh. Norman tells Lucy that the 150-year-old Freudstein lives by using his victims' parts to regenerate blood cells. Norman attacks Freudstein, but the ghoul twists the hatchet away. Grabbing a knife from the slab Norman stabs Freudstein, causing rotten flesh and maggots to ooze out of his old lab coat. Freudstein grabs Norman and rips open his throat. Lucy and Bob climb a ladder leading to the underside of the cracked tombstone. Lucy strains to shift the stone, but Freudstein grabs her and drags her down the stairs, killing her by ramming her head into the concrete floor. As Freudstein advances up the ladder, Bob strains to escape. As Freudstein grabs Bob's leg, he is suddenly pulled upwards by Mae. With Mae is her mother, Mary Freudstein (Teresa Rossi Passante), who tells them it's time to leave. Mrs. Freudstein leads Mae and Bob down the wintry grove into an apparent ghost world.

Screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti was inspired by Henry James' The Turn of the Screw. Sacchetti also stated the film was based on his own personal experiences as a child, being born in a large country house with a large dark basement and that age 9 he had to cross a cemetery at night. In his biography, Fulci spoke negatively about Sacchetti's contributions as a screenwriter saying that The House by the Cemetery was derivative of scenes from The House That Screamed. The film went through several changes from the original story by Elisa Briganti and the script by Sacchetti. The script was originally titled La notte dell'inferno () which became La casa di Freudstein and then Quella casa accanto al cimitero. Sacchetti's script was revised by Fulci and Giorgio Mariuzzo, Mariuzzo claimed he worked as a script doctor slightly changing work stating that Sacchetti's scripts were often too short. Sacchetti commented on this stating that \\"Mariuzzo always intervened afterwards, either because I had to leave to work on another film or refused to make those changes that Lucio demanded. That was the reason for our arguments.\\" The House by the Cemetery was shot on location in New York, Boston, and Concord, Massachusetts. The film was also shot in studios at De Paolis In.Co.R. Studios in Rome. Shooting the film took eight weeks between March 16 and May 1981. The film was made on a budget of approximately 600 million Italian lire. Despite the credits stating that the special make-up effects were provided by Giannetto di Rossi and Maurizio Trani, only Trani worked on the film.  Release The Italian ratings board asked for a brief six-second cut in The House by the Cemetery where Dagmar Lassander's character Laura Gittleson is murdered. The film opened in Turin on August 14, 1981. and was distributed by Medusa Distribuzione. The film grossed a total of 1,407,981,297 lire in Italy, making it Fulci's most financially successful horror film of the 1980s. Prior to the films theatrical release in France, it was shown at the Festival International du film fantastique et de science- fiction in Paris with Fulci's earlier film The Black Cat. It was released in France on March 24, 1982. The film was released in the United Kingdom on October 15, 1982 where it was distributed by Eagle Films. The film was passed with cuts by the BBFC involving scenes being trimmed involving Ann and Laura's murders which gave the film a 84 minute and 49 second running time. This version of the film was released on home video in the UK and was later placed on the video nasties list after the Video Recordings Act 1984. It was re- released on home video in 1988 with four minutes and eleven seconds of the film cut. The film was re-released on May 29, 2001 with only 33 seconds cut and again in 2009 uncut. It was re-released by Blue Underground on Blu-ray and DVD on 25 October 2011 with a new 2K transfer.  Critical reception  From contemporary reviews, Julian Petley (Monthly Film Bulletin) commented that the film had a \\"Frankenstein theme\\" but that \\"the film adds little to the well- worked legend\\" and that \\"this would matter less were the film visually richer, but for the most part it is comparatively sober and restrained, at least by Fulci standards\\" Petley continued that \\"the film undeniably has its moments–Bob's escape from the cellar; the human debris of Freudstein's laboratory; an attack by a particularly ferocious and tenacious bat; the climactic appearance of the horribly mutated Freudstein\\" Giovanna Grassi of Corriere della Sera dismissed it as an \\"Italian Shining\\" and concluded it to be \\"a condensation of rip-offs,commonplaces and badly repeated horror conventions.\\" Aldo Vigano of La Stampa commented on the use of children in the film, stating that \\"to see children involved in such a gruesome and oppressive horror story will perhaps cause disconcert and discomfort, rather than pity in many spectators.\\" In France, Philippe Ross of La Revue du cinéma proclaimed that Fulci had to show \\"us something other than these endless scenes of butchery who truly become more and more painful and soporific\\" Christophe Gans reviewed the film in ' stated that \\"Except for two or three welcome details [...] the suspense \\"for laughter\\", so appreciated by American filmmakers, here becomes particularly tedious\\" Gans praised the films visuals, noting \\"melancholic, wintery photography\\" while still concluding that the film's \\"repertoire of gimmicks repeated or borrowed from Argento, our greatest regrets is the absence of madness in the explanation of the monster, yelled amid the din of a stretched suspense.\\" From retrospective reviews, film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 38%, based on , with a rating average of 4.7/10. Time Out called the film \\"a hack-work of almost awesome incoherence\\". Allmovie praised the film, complimenting its atmosphere.

Other common names are sweet verbena tree, sweet verbena myrtle, (lemon scented verbena is another species), and lemon scented backhousia. Growth It can reach in height, but is often smaller. The leaves are evergreen, opposite, lanceolate, long and broad, glossy green, with an entire margin. The flowers are creamy-white, in diameter, produced in clusters at the ends of the branches from summer through to autumn, after petal fall the calyx is persistent. Etymology Lemon myrtle was given the botanical name Backhousia citriodora in 1853 after the English botanist, James Backhouse. The common name reflects the strong lemon smell of the crushed leaves. \\"Lemon scented myrtle\\" was the primary common name until the shortened trade name, \\"lemon myrtle\\", was created by the native foods industry to market the leaf for culinary use. Lemon myrtle is now the more common name for the plant and its products. Lemon myrtle is sometimes confused with \\"lemon ironbark\\", which is Eucalyptus staigeriana. Essential oils Lemon Myrtle (Backhousia citriodora) essential oil in a clear glass vial Backhousia citriodora has two essential oil chemotypes: * The citral chemotype is more prevalent and is cultivated in Australia for flavouring and essential oil. Citral as an isolate in steam distilled lemon myrtle oil is typically 90–98%, and oil yield 1–3% from fresh leaf. It is the highest natural source of citral. * The citronellal chemotype is uncommon, and can be used as an insect repellent. Uses Indigenous Australians have long used lemon myrtle, both in cuisine and as a healing plant. The oil has the highest citral purity; typically higher than lemongrass. It is also considered to have a \\"cleaner and sweeter\\" aroma than comparable sources of citral–lemongrass and Litsea cubeba.The Aromatic Plant Project =Culinary= Dried and crushed Lemon myrtle leaves Lemon myrtle is one of the well known bushfood flavours and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Queen of the lemon herbs\\".The Cook and the Chef, ABC TV . The leaf is often used as dried flakes, or in the form of an encapsulated flavour essence for enhanced shelf-life. It has a range of uses, such as lemon myrtle flakes in shortbread; flavouring in pasta; whole leaf with baked fish; infused in macadamia or vegetable oils; and made into tea, including tea blends. It can also be used as a lemon flavour replacement in milk-based foods, such as cheesecake, lemon flavoured ice-cream and sorbet without the curdling problem associated with lemon fruit acidity. The dried leaf has free radical scavenging ability.Zhao, J., Agboola, S., Functional Properties of Australian Bushfoods – A Report for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, 2007, RIRDC Publication No 07/030 =Antimicrobial= Lemon myrtle essential oil possesses antimicrobial properties; however the undiluted essential oil is toxic to human cells in vitro. When diluted to approximately 1%, absorption through the skin and subsequent damage is thought to be minimal. Lemon myrtle oil has a high Rideal–Walker coefficient, a measure of antimicrobial potency. Use of lemon myrtle oil as a treatment for skin lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a disease affecting children and immuno-compromised patients, has been investigated. Nine of sixteen patients who were treated with 10% strength lemon myrtle oil showed a significant improvement, compared to none in the control group. A study in 2003 which investigated the effectiveness of different preparations of lemon myrtle against bacteria and fungi concluded that the plant had potential as an antiseptic or as a surface disinfectant, or as an anti-microbial food additive. The oil is a popular ingredient in health care and cleaning products, especially soaps, lotions, skin-whitening preparations and shampoos.Lemon Myrtle Uses, Products and Patents Cultivation Lemon myrtle is a cultivated ornamental plant. It can be grown from tropical to warm temperate climates, and may handle cooler districts provided it can be protected from frost when young. In cultivation it rarely exceeds about and usually has a dense canopy. The principal attraction to gardeners is the lemon smell which perfumes both the leaves and flowers of the tree. Lemon myrtle is a hardy plant which tolerates all but the poorest drained soils. It can be slow growing but responds well to slow release fertilisers. Seedling lemon myrtle go through a shrubby, slow juvenile growth stage, before developing a dominant trunk. Lemon myrtle can also be propagated from cutting, but is slow to strike. A study into the plant growing adventitious roots found that \\"actively growing axillary buds, wide stems and mature leaves\\" are good indicators that a cutting will take root successfully and survive. A further study on temperature recommended glasshouses for growing cuttings throughout the year. Growing cuttings from mature trees bypasses the shrubby juvenile stage. Cutting propagation is also used to provide a consistent product in commercial production. In plantation cultivation the tree is typically maintained as a shrub by regular harvesting from the top and sides. Mechanical harvesting is used in commercial plantations. It is important to retain some lower branches when pruning for plant health. The harvested leaves are dried for leaf spice, or distilled for the essential oil. The majority of commercial lemon myrtle is grown in Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales, Australia. A 2009 study has suggested that drying lemon myrtle leaves at higher temperatures improves the citral content of the dried leaves, but discolours the leaves more. Myrtle rust A significant fungal pathogen, myrtle rust (Uredo rangelii) was detected in lemon myrtle plantations in January 2011.Myrtle rust host list, NSW Primary Industries Myrtle rust confirmed on lemon myrtle plantation, ABC Rural Myrtle rust severely damages new growth and threatens lemon myrtle production.

The Santram mandir runs trusts for humanitarian activities like Eye Hospital, Physiotherapy Center, Dispensary, Radiology Center, Pathology & Laboratory as well as various other services which is countless. It also carries out various cultural as well as social activities. There are other \\"Santram Mandir\\" located in Vadodara, Karamsad, Padra, Koyli, Umreth, Radhu, Kalser, Pachegaam, Chaklasi, Sojitra & Varad. And several other places has its Paaduka like Raniya, Narsanda, Sarsavni, Salun, Piplag, Alindra and many more places. Many people offer fast on Thursdays, Purnima & Ekadashi in reverence to Santram Maharaj. Few years ago the Santram mandir was made of wood but endowments in the form of donation that received large amount have transformed it. There is done beautiful decoration by them it look wonderful in some special days like sakar varsha, dev diwali etc. Beautiful rangoli are also done. On devdiwali the whole temple is decorated with lamps. History The original Santram Maharaj was a Saint of the Avadhoot category. He came to Nadiad from Girnar, so he was also called Girnari Bava, Videhi Bava, or Sukha-Sagarji. He came here in Samvat 1872, lived for the spiritual good of People for the 15 years, and took Jivat- Samadhi on the full-moon-day of the month Magha of Samvat 1887. The present Mahant of the Nadiad temple, Shree Ramdasji is the ninth Mahant on the Gadi of the temple. The details are as follows: # Shree Santram Maharaj: His Samadhi- date was the full-moon-day of Magha of Samvat 1887. # Shree Laxmandasji Maharaj: His Samadhi-date was the 14th day of the dark-half of Vaishakh of Samvat 1925. # Shree Chaturdas Maharaj: His Samadhi-date was the 9th of the bright-half of Asho (Ashvin-month) of Samvat 1941. # Shree Jayaramdas Maharaj: (1941 to 1947): His Samadhi-date was the 11th day of the bright half of Jyestha of Samvat 1947. # Shree Mugutram Maharaj: (1947 to 1961), His Samadhi- date was the 8th day of the bright-half of Sharavan of Samvat 1961. # Shree Manekdas Maharaj: (1961 to 1973), His Samadhi-date was 11th day of the bright half of Vaishakh of Samvat 1973. # Shree Jankidas Maharaj: (1973 to 2026), His Samadhi-date was the 8th day of the bright half of Vaishakh of Samvat 2026. # Shree Narayandas Maharaj: (2023 to 2060)Sat on Gadi of the temple on 7 June 1967 (Samvat 2023). # Shree Ramdas Maharaj: 2060 till today. Shree Jankidas Maharaj occupied the Gadi for 53 years and he was very practical. He could see through a man as soon as he came near him. The temple's expansion became very big during his period. It became known throughout India. He did many things for the good for the temple: # In Samvat 2007, he obtained a primary school building for Boys constructed at the cost of Rs. 1,16,101 and hand it over to the Nadiad Municipality. # In Samvat 2017, he built the Santram Kanyashala (Girls' School), constructed at the cost of Rs. 70,087. # Before that in Samvat 2000, he purchased the Atithi-Nivas at the price of Rs. 84,709 and put it at the Service of the people. # In Samvat 2000, he got constructed the building Arogya-Bhavan at the cost of Rs. 50,668 and put it at the service of the people. # In Samvat 2010, he got constructed the shed of Yoga-Khand at the cost of Rs. 82,683. # In Samvat 2024, he got constructed the Hostel for Boys at the cost of Rs. 80,000. At present 150 pupils are reside in it. # In Samvat 2025, he got constructed the building of the Eye-Hospital and handed it over to the Sad-Vichar-Samitee. # In Samvat 2028, Shree Narayandas Maharaj constructed the building of Satsang-Bhavan, two meditation-halls, and 6 flats for the Saints, who come to deliver religious discourses, at the cost of one lakh rupees. Religious discourses are given, all the year round, by learned Saints. Hundreds of people come to hear them every evening and to take benefit of their holy company everyday. In the morning and evening, hundreds of poor people are fed in the temple. Shree Narayandas, followed in the foot steps of Shree Jankidasji Maharaj, by constantly did work to alleviate hunger.

Together with phosphorylases, debranching enzymes mobilize glucose reserves from glycogen deposits in the muscles and liver. This constitutes a major source of energy reserves in most organisms. Glycogen breakdown is highly regulated in the body, especially in the liver, by various hormones including insulin and glucagon, to maintain a homeostatic balance of blood-glucose levels. When glycogen breakdown is compromised by mutations in the glycogen debranching enzyme, metabolic diseases such as Glycogen storage disease type III can result. Glucosyltransferase and glucosidase are performed by a single enzyme in mammals, yeast, and some bacteria, but by two distinct enzymes in E. coli and other bacteria, complicating nomenclature. Proteins that catalyze both functions are referred to as glycogen debranching enzymes (GDEs). When glucosyltransferase and glucosidase are catalyzed by distinct enzymes, \\"glycogen debranching enzyme\\" usually refers to the glucosidase enzyme. In some literature, an enzyme capable only of glucosidase is referred to as a \\"debranching enzyme\\".  Function  Together with phosphorylase, glycogen debranching enzymes function in glycogen breakdown and glucose mobilization. When phosphorylase has digested a glycogen branch down to four glucose residues, it will not remove further residues. Glycogen debranching enzymes assist phosphorylase, the primary enzyme involved in glycogen breakdown, in the mobilization of glycogen stores. Phosphorylase can only cleave α-1,4- glycosidic bond between adjacent glucose molecules in glycogen but branches also exist as α-1,6 linkages. When phosphorylase reaches four residues from a branching point it stops cleaving; because 1 in 10 residues is branched, cleavage by phosphorylase alone would not be sufficient in mobilizing glycogen stores. Before phosphorylase can resume catabolism, debranching enzymes perform two functions: * 4-α-D-glucanotransferase (), or glucosyltransferase, transfers three glucose residues from the four-residue glycogen branch to a nearby branch. This exposes a single glucose residue joined to the glucose chain through an α -1,6 glycosidic linkage * Amylo-α-1,6-glucosidase (), or glucosidase, cleaves the remaining alpha-1,6 linkage, producing glucose and a linear chain of glycogen. The mechanism by which the glucosidase cleaves the α -1,6-linkage is not fully known because the amino acids in the active site have not yet been identified. It is thought to proceed through a two step acid base assistance type mechanism, with an oxocarbenium ion intermediate, and retention of configuration in glucose. This is a common method through which to cleave bonds, with an acid below the site of hydrolysis to lend a proton and a base above to deprotinate a water which can then act as a nucleophile. These acids and bases are amino acid side chains in the active site of the enzyme. A scheme for the mechanism is shown in the figure below. File:Glycosidase mechanism.png Thus the debranching enzymes, transferase and α-1,6- glucosidase converts the branched glycogen structure into a linear one, paving the way for further cleavage by phosphorylase.  Structure and activity  = Two enzymes = In E. coli and other bacteria, glucosyltransferase and glucosidase functions are performed by two distinct enzymes. In E. coli, Glucose transfer is performed by 4-alpha- glucanotransferase, a 78.5 kDa protein coded for by the gene malQ. A second protein, referred to as debranching enzyme, performs α-1,6-glucose cleavage. This enzyme has a molecular mass of 73.6 kDa, and is coded for by the gene glgX. Activity of the two enzymes is not always necessarily coupled. In E. coli glgX selectively catalyzes the cleavage of 4-subunit branches, without the action of glucanotransferase. The product of this cleavage, maltotetraose, is further degraded by maltodextrin phosphorylase. E. coli GlgX is structurally similar to the protein isoamylase. The monomeric protein contains a central domain in which eight parallel beta-strands are surrounded by eight parallel alpha strands. Notable within this structure is a groove 26 angstroms long and 9 angstroms wide, containing aromatic residues that are thought to stabilize a four-glucose branch before cleavage. The glycogen-degrading enzyme of the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus, treX, provides an interesting example of using a single active site for two activities: amylosidase and glucanotransferase activities. TreX is structurally similar to glgX, and has a mass of 80kD and one active site. Unlike either glgX, however, treX exists as a dimer and tetramer in solution. TreX's oligomeric form seems to play a significant role in altering both enzyme shape and function. Dimerization is thought to stabilize a \\"flexible loop\\" located close to the active site. This may be key to explaining why treX (and not glgX) shows glucosyltransferase activity. As a tetramer, the catalytic efficiency of treX is increased fourfold over its dimeric form. = One enzyme with two catalytic sites = In mammals and yeast, a single enzyme performs both debranching functions. The human glycogen debranching enzyme (gene: AGL) is a monomer with a molecular weight of 175 kDa. It has been shown that the two catalytic actions of AGL can function independently of each other, demonstrating that multiple active sites are present. This idea has been reinforced with inhibitors of the active site, such as polyhydroxyamine, which were found to inhibit glucosidase activity while transferase activity was not measurably changed. Glycogen debranching enzyme is the only known eukaryotic enzyme that contains multiple catalytic sites and is active as a monomer. Some studies have shown that the C-terminal half of yeast GDE is associated with glucosidase activity, while the N-terminal half is associated with glucosyltransferase activity. In addition to these two active sites, AGL appears to contain a third active site that allows it to bind to a glycogen polymer. It is thought to bind to six glucose molecules of the chain as well as the branched glucose, thus corresponding to 7 subunits within the active site, as shown in the figure below. File:Hypothesized substraight binding location.png The structure of the Candida glabrata GDE has been reported. The structure revealed that distinct domains in GDE encode the glucanotransferase and glucosidase activities. Their catalyses are similar to that of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase, respectively. Their active sites are selective towards the respective substrates, ensuring proper activation of GDE. Besides the active sites GDE have additional binding sites for glycogen, which are important for its recruitment to glycogen. Mapping the disease-causing mutations onto the GDE structure provided insights into glycogen storage disease type III.  Genetic location  The official name for the gene is \\"amylo- α- 1,6- glucosidase, 4- α- glucanotransferase\\", with the official symbol AGL. AGL is an autosomal gene found on chromosome lp21. The AGL gene provides instructions for making several different versions, known as isoforms, of the glycogen debranching enzyme. These isoforms vary by size and are expressed in different tissues, such as liver and muscle. This gene has been studied in great detail, because mutation at this gene is the cause of Glycogen Storage Disease Type III. The gene is 85 kb long, has 35 exons and encodes for a 7.0 kb mRNA. Translation of the gene begins at exon 3,which encodes for the first 27 amino acids of the AGL gene, because the first two exons (68kb) contain the 5' untranslated region. Exons 4-35 encode the remaining 1505 amino acids of the AGL gene. Studies produced by the department of pediatrics at Duke University suggest that the human AGL gene contains at minimum 2 promotor regions, sites where the transcription of the gene begins, that result in differential expression of isoform, different forms of the same protein, mRNAs in a manner that is specific for different tissues.  Clinical significance  When GDE activity is compromised, the body cannot effectively release stored glycogen, type III Glycogen Storage Disease (debrancher deficiency), an autosomal recessive disorder, can result. In GSD III glycogen breakdown is incomplete and there is accumulation of abnormal glycogen with short outer branches. Most patients exhibit GDE defiency in both liver and muscle (Type IIIa), although 15% of patients have retained GDE in muscle while having it absent from the liver (Type IIIb). Depending on mutation location, different mutations in the AGL gene can affect different isoforms of the gene expression. For example, mutations that occur on exon 3, affect the form which affect the isoform that is primarily expressed in the liver; this would lead to GSD type III. These different manifestation produce varied symptoms, which can be nearly indistinguishable from Type I GSD, including hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia in children, short stature, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Type IIIa patients often exhibit symptoms related to liver disease and progressive muscle involvement, with variations caused by age of onset, rate of disease progression and severity. Patients with Type IIIb generally symptoms related to liver disease. Type III patients be distinguished by elevated liver enzymes, with normal uric acid and blood lactate levels, differing from other forms of GSD. In patients with muscle involvement, Type IIIa, the muscle weakness becomes predominant into adulthood and can lead to ventricular hypertrophy and distal muscle wasting.

It began in 1834 as a theme and sixteen variations on a theme by Baron von Fricken, plus a further variation on an entirely different theme by Heinrich Marschner. Composition The first edition in 1837 carried an annotation that the tune was \\"the composition of an amateur\\": this referred to the origin of the theme, which had been sent to Schumann by Baron von Fricken, guardian of Ernestine von Fricken, the Estrella of his Carnaval Op. 9. The baron, an amateur musician, had used the melody in a Theme with Variations for flute. Schumann had been engaged to Ernestine in 1834, only to break abruptly with her the year after. An autobiographical element is thus interwoven in the genesis of the Études symphoniques (as in that of many other works of Schumann's).The link would have been obvious if the composer had retained the title of the 1835 version, Fantaisies et Finale sur un theme de M. le Baron de Fricken. Of the sixteen variations Schumann composed on Fricken's theme, only eleven were published by him. (An early version, completed between 1834 and January 1835, contained twelve movements). The final, twelfth, published étude was a variation on the theme from the Romance Du stolzes England freue dich (Proud England, rejoice!), from Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Templer und die Jüdin, which was based on Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (as a tribute to Schumann's English friend, William Sterndale Bennett). The earlier Fricken theme occasionally appears briefly during this étude. The work was first published in 1837 as XII Études Symphoniques. Only nine of the twelve études were specifically designated as variations. The sequence was as follows: * Theme – Andante [C♯ minor] * Etude I (Variation 1) – Un poco più vivo [C♯ minor] * Etude II (Variation 2) – Andante [C♯ minor] * Etude III – Vivace [E Major] * Etude IV (Variation 3) – Allegro marcato [C♯ minor] * Etude V (Variation 4) – Scherzando [C♯ minor] * Etude VI (Variation 5) – Agitato [C♯ minor] * Etude VII (Variation 6) – Allegro molto [E Major] * Etude VIII (Variation 7) – Sempre marcatissimo [C♯ minor] * Etude IX – Presto possibile [C♯ minor] * Etude X (Variation 8) – Allegro con energia [C♯ minor] * Etude XI (Variation 9) – Andante espressivo [G♯ minor] * Etude XII (Finale) – Allegro brillante (based on Marschner's theme) [D♭ Major] Other titles had been considered in September 1834: Variations pathétiques and Etuden im Orchestercharakter von Florestan und Eusebius. In this latter case the Études would have been signed by two imaginary figures in whom Schumann personified two essential, opposite and complementary aspects of his own personality and his own poetic world. 'Florestan and Eusebius' then signed the Davidsbündlertänze, Op. 6; but only in the 1835 version of the Études symphoniques were the pieces divided so as to emphasize the alternation of more lyrical, melancholy and introvert pages (Eusebius) with those of a more excitable and dynamic nature (Florestan). In the 1837 version Florestan prevails. Fifteen years later, in a second edition (Leipzig 1852), the 1837 title Études symphoniques became Études en forme de variations, two etudes (Nos. 3 and 9) that did not correspond to the new title (not being exactly variations) were eliminated, and some revisions were made in the piano writing. The entire work was dedicated to Schumann's English friend, the pianist and composer William Sterndale Bennett. Bennett played the piece frequently in England to great acclaim, but Schumann thought it was unsuitable for public performance and advised his wife Clara not to play it. Character Leaving aside the allusions to Florestan and Eusebius, all of Schumann's proposed titles show some of the essential character of Op. 13's conception. This was of 'studies' in the sense that the term had assumed in Frédéric Chopin's Op. 10, that is to say, concert pieces in which the investigation of possibilities of technique and timbre in writing for the piano is carried out; they are 'symphonic études' through the wealth and complexity of the colours evoked – the keyboard becomes an \\"orchestra\\" capable of blending, contrasting or superimposing different timbres. If etudes Nos. 3 and 9 are excluded, where the connection with the theme is tenuous, the etudes are in variation form. It was not the first time that Schumann had tackled variation form.Examples include the Abegg Variations, Op. 1 (though much less complex); some incomplete youthful pages (from which stand out the Variations on the Allegretto of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, where the manner in which the variations are conceived is already completely alien to the virtuosically ornamented convention then prevalent); and the Impromptus on a theme of Clara Wieck, Op. 5 But here the variation principle is used more as free transformation, no longer of an actual theme, but of a musical 'cell' or cells (as for example in the same composer's Carnaval). The Études symphoniques learn the lesson of Beethoven's Diabelli Variations: the theme that acts as a unifying element is amplified and transformed, and becomes the basis from which blossom inventions of divergent expressive character. The work also shows the influence of the Goldberg Variations, most obviously in the use of a pseudo-French overture variation, and in the use of various canonic effects. The highly virtuosic demands of the piano writing are frequently aimed not merely at effect but at clarification of the polyphonic complexity and at delving more deeply into keyboard experimentation. The Etudes are considered to be one of the most difficult works for piano by Schumann (together with his Fantasy in C and Toccata) and in Romantic literature as a whole. Later publication history In 1861, five years after Schumann's death, his father- in-law Friedrich Wieck published a third edition under the editorial pseudonym \\"DAS\\" (an acronym for Der alte Schulmeister). This edition attempted to reconcile the differences between the earlier two, and bore both the previous titles XII Études Symphoniques and Études en forme de variations. On republishing the set in 1890, Johannes Brahms restored the five variations that had been cut by Schumann. These are now often played, but in positions within the cycle that vary somewhat with each performance; there are now twelve variations and these five so-called \\"posthumous\\" variations which exist as a supplement. The five posthumously published sections (all based on Fricken's theme) are: * Variation I – Andante, Tempo del tema * Variation II – Meno mosso * Variation III – Allegro * Variation IV – Allegretto * Variation V – Moderato. Orchestrations Two sections, including the Allegro brillante, were orchestrated by Tchaikovsky, and have been recorded.Amazon Notes External links *Robert Schumann's Symphonic Etudes Analysis and description of Robert Schumann's Symphonic Etudes  performed by Emil Gilels * performed by Peter Bradley-Fulgoni Schumann Piano music by Robert Schumann 1834 compositions Variations Compositions in C-sharp minor ","title":"Symphonic Studies (Schumann)"},{"id":"2940705","text":"Raw FM was an Australian Television series produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that aired for one season of thirteen episodes between November 1997 and February 1998.

The stats included in the book can be easily converted to use with its Star Wars role-playing game The Star Wars Miniatures Battles Companion, published in 1994, was the first supplement and added vehicle rules and flight rules to the game. It also included errata and rules revisions, as well as new and optional rules, new equipment, a section detailing unit insignia and organization, and a collection of game scenarios. The Imperial Entanglements book, published in 1996, was primarily a scenario supplement, but also contained updated errata and new squad stats. Both the core rulebook and companion were repackaged in two boxed sets along with some miniatures, The Star Wars Miniatures Battles Starter Set and Star Wars Vehicles Starter Set respectively. A third set, the Mos Eisley Adventure Set which was targeted primarily to the RPG aspect, included not only some miniatures and maps, but a small supplement with a Miniatures Battles scenario. Also, the short run series of the Star Wars Adventure Journal had a few articles pertaining to the miniatures rules. Reception It was winner of the 1991 Origins Award for Best New Miniatures Rules.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar- class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti- submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Bendigo) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Bendigo was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, New South Wales on 12 August 1940, launched on 1 March 1941 by Dame Mary Hughes, wife of the Minister for the Navy, and commissioned on 10 May 1941. Operational history HMAS Bendigo departed Sydney 4 July 1941 for two months operation in the Darwin area before departing 22 September and joining the corvettes , and forming the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla of Royal Navy's China Squadron based at Singapore on 24 November 1941 and where she was located on 8 December 1941 when the Pacific War began. =Singapore= During January 1942 Bendigo operated from Singapore in sweeping, escort and patrol as far south as the Berhala and Banka Straits until anchoring in Singapore on 30 January and remaining in the harbour until 6 February during which Japanese bombers were overhead daily and near misses scarred the hull with shrapnel. On 5 February only Bendigo and , another ship of the flotilla, were at Singapore with the rest having shifted operations to Java and Sumatra in the Netherlands East Indies. The two ships then moved from their anchorage to assist and other convoy escorts in the rescue of survivors of the troop ship . On 6 February, with Japanese advances on the city itself in progress, the ships began operations toward Abang IslandA minor island in the Riau Archipelago located southwest of Galang Island. with particular orders to ensure destruction of radar sets and electronic equipment aboard the bombed and stranded ship Loch Ranza. Bendigo left Singapore at 21:20 to act as lightship for an outgoing convoy followed by Wollongong, the last Australian warship to leave the city, at midnight. After finding Loch Ranza burned out and sunk the ships made their way along the coast of Sumatra, hiding in inlets from air search, finally joining and at Palembang on the afternoon of 11 February. =Collapse of Java= On 12 February the situation at Palembang was alarming enough that the officer in command of the minesweepers, including the small minesweepers and that had accompanied Ballarat and Toowoomba from Singapore, ordered the ships to sea. At the request of the Dutch authorities they provided escort for a convoy of twelve ships heading for Batavia where in the Banka Strait the convoy joined a stream of vessels fleeing Singapore with the convoy itself growing to twenty-eight ships. The convoy hugged the coast and, though still attracting air attacks, were not the focus as a convoy of large tankers taking the main route was the main target. As Sumatra fell and Java became the next invasion target Bendigo, Ballarat, Burnie and Maryborough on 22 February replaced coal burning British auxiliaries of the joint Dutch and British Sunda Strait Patrol, an effort to prevent Japanese infiltration of Java by use of small craft. By the 28th, the base they were using for the patrols was untenable, the ships were short of fuel and they were to replenish at Tjilatjap but Bendigo, along with Burnie, were ordered to fall back to pick up survivors seen signalling from the beach at Java Head. The ships that had gone ahead were ordered back to the Sunda Strait but Bendigo with fifteen and Burnie with twenty-nine survivors aboard were directed to now head for Tjilatjap. In the meantime the Battle of the Java Sea on the 27th and Battle of Sunda Strait, taking place on the night of these events, had sealed the fate of Java and the short lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA). On 1 March Batavia was being evacuated with truck convoys and trains headed for Tjilatjap where all British warships were ordered to assist in evacuation. Arriving there in the afternoon Bendigo then broadcast a message from Commodore Collins, commanding British naval forces, advising that Japanese forces were to the south and ships with sufficient fuel should avoid Tjilatjap and head directly for Fremantle or across the Indian Ocean to Colombo. Bendigo with eighty-nine passengers aboard sailed for Fremantle shortly before midnight in advance of the remainder of the group which, excepting Burnie now with Collins aboard, had not yet arrived. =Australia and New Guinea= The Japanese forces south of Java were the cruisers and destroyers under Admiral Kondō. Bendigo had narrowly avoided that force which had already accounted for and not long after being sighted by Bendigo, . On 8 March 1942 Bendigo and Burnie both arrived at Fremantle to join other ships, including Ashvilles luckier companions and the last of the United States Asiatic Fleet surface units , and , escaping Java and Kondō's blocking force. The remainder of the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla's corvettes arrived safely on 9 March after having been among the rearguard of Allied naval forces all the way from Singapore. Survivors from clinging to wreckage about to be rescued by HMAS Bendigo, 8 March 1943. By April 1942, with convoy escorts desperately needed, five of the Australian-built corvettes including BendigoThe others were Goulburn, Ballarat, and Kalgoorlie. were assigned to the ANZAC Area covering the eastern approaches to Australia, a zone that was shortly later reorganized into the new Southwest Pacific Area. Operations during this period included convoy duty during the Japanese submarine attacks on Australia's east coast. By September 1942, in the buildup at Port Moresby and Milne Bay in New Guinea escorting convoys and providing antisubmarine patrol. During Operation Lilliput, small convoys from Milne Bay to Oro Bay supporting the campaign at Buna-Gona, she was providing escort for the Dutch ship on 8 March 1943 when that ship came under air attack and was sunk with Bendigo rescuing the survivors. In Operation Accountant, a simultaneous effort with Lilliput to move the United States 162nd Infantry Regiment from Australia to the New Guinea front, the ship was one of four corvettes involved in the New Guinea convoy segment. Bendigo and HMAS Moresby were escorting convoy OC-86 from Melbourne to Newcastle during 11 April 1943 attack in which the cargo ship Recina was sunk that signalled resumption of submarine activity after a lull. Bendigo was one of the sixteen Australian ships specified in the twenty-four escorts that were to be part of the British Pacific Fleet in a 26 January 1945 in a listing provided by that fleet's commander to Allied forces. By March 1945 Bendigo was operating in the Philippines as part of a task unit of that fleet and took part in the Battle of Okinawa later that month through May 1945. Following the end of the war Bendigo and the other ships of 21st Minesweeping Flotilla along with 22nd Minesweeping Flotilla operated as a minesweeper and anti-piracy patrol vessel in the Hong Kong area before returning to Australia in December 1945. The corvette was awarded the battle honours \\"Pacific 1942–44\\", \\"New Guinea 1942–44\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\" for her wartime service. Sale—People's Liberation Army Navy Bendigo, paid off on 27 September 1946, was sold to the Ta Hing Company of Hong Kong as a seagoing vessel and renamed Cheung Hing. However, the ship was later acquired by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and re-armed for naval service under the name Luoyang. She appears to have left PLAN service by 1988.

The ship's company consisted of 22 personnel. Each patrol boat was armed with a single 40 mm Bofors gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50 cal Browning machineguns and an 81-mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime after 1988. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin-mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class' service life, but this did not eventuate.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 88Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 222 Bendigo was laid down by North Queensland Engineers and Agents at Cairns, Queensland on 21 September 1981, launched on 9 April 1983, and commissioned on 28 May 1983.Moore, Jane's Fighting Ships 1985–86, p. 26 Operational history Bendigo operated out of , and spent the majority of her career protecting Australia's northern borders.

He did work for the resistance to Hitler's rule in Nazi Germany. He was sentenced to death in connection with the failed 20 July Plot. Life Reinhold Frank was born the youngest of seven children in Bachhaupten in the Sigmaringen district. After serving in the military in the First World War, he studied law in Freiburg. He was a member of the Katholische Deutsche Studentenverbindung Arminia (\\"Catholic German Studentenverbindung Arminia\\") in the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. After his time as a junior lawyer, he went to Karlsruhe and there, together with Dr. Honold, he ran a law practice. Owing to his Christian outlook, Nazi ideology did not sit well with Frank. He often found himself defending persecuted clients of all political and religious stripes, among them Catholic priests, who often ended up before the courts during the time of the Third Reich for having uttered criticisms of the régime. Reinhold Frank belonged to the circle about the resistance group founded by Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. He had already agreed to stand ready in Baden to take a leading rôle in Germany's reconstruction, should the plot to overthrow Hitler actually succeed. It was therefore no wonder that, after the attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia failed, Frank was arrested quite quickly, on 21 July 1944, the day after the attempt. Frank was found guilty by the Volksgerichtshof of high treason and treason. On 12 January 1945, he was sentenced to death. He was hanged on 23 January at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. In his honour, a memorial stone has been placed at the Hauptfriedhof (\\"Main Cemetery\\") in Karlsruhe. The street in Karlsruhe where the lawyers' chambers may be found bears his name. The Research Centre for German Resistance against National Socialism in Southwestern Germany, together with the University of Karlsruhe, the City of Karlsruhe, and the German Bundesarchiv, honours Frank yearly in the time around 20 July with a memorial reading.

This ensures that each participant or subject has an equal chance of being placed in any group. Random assignment of participants helps to ensure that any differences between and within the groups are not systematic at the outset of the experiment. Thus, any differences between groups recorded at the end of the experiment can be more confidently attributed to the experimental procedures or treatment. Random assignment, blinding, and controlling are key aspects of the design of experiments, because they help ensure that the results are not spurious or deceptive via confounding. This is why randomized controlled trials are vital in clinical research, especially ones that can be double-blinded and placebo-controlled. Mathematically, there are distinctions between randomization, pseudorandomization, and quasirandomization, as well as between random number generators and pseudorandom number generators. How much these differences matter in experiments (such as clinical trials) is a matter of trial design and statistical rigor, which affect evidence grading. Studies done with pseudo- or quasirandomization are usually given nearly the same weight as those with true randomization but are viewed with a bit more caution. Benefits of random assignment Imagine an experiment in which the participants are not randomly assigned; perhaps the first 10 people to arrive are assigned to the Experimental group, and the last 10 people to arrive are assigned to the Control group. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter finds differences between the Experimental group and the Control group, and claims these differences are a result of the experimental procedure. However, they also may be due to some other preexisting attribute of the participants, e.g. people who arrive early versus people who arrive late. Imagine the experimenter instead uses a coin flip to randomly assign participants. If the coin lands heads-up, the participant is assigned to the Experimental group. If the coin lands tails-up, the participant is assigned to the Control group. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter finds differences between the Experimental group and the Control group. Because each participant had an equal chance of being placed in any group, it is unlikely the differences could be attributable to some other preexisting attribute of the participant, e.g. those who arrived on time versus late. Potential issues Random assignment does not guarantee that the groups are matched or equivalent. The groups may still differ on some preexisting attribute due to chance. The use of random assignment cannot eliminate this possibility, but it greatly reduces it. To express this same idea statistically - If a randomly assigned group is compared to the mean it may be discovered that they differ, even though they were assigned from the same group. If a test of statistical significance is applied to randomly assigned groups to test the difference between sample means against the null hypothesis that they are equal to the same population mean (i.e., population mean of differences = 0), given the probability distribution, the null hypothesis will sometimes be \\"rejected,\\" that is, deemed not plausible. That is, the groups will be sufficiently different on the variable tested to conclude statistically that they did not come from the same population, even though, procedurally, they were assigned from the same total group. For example, using random assignment may create an assignment to groups that has 20 blue-eyed people and 5 brown-eyed people in one group. This is a rare event under random assignment, but it could happen, and when it does it might add some doubt to the causal agent in the experimental hypothesis. Random sampling Random sampling is a related, but distinct process. Random sampling is recruiting participants in a way that they represent a larger population. Because most basic statistical tests require the hypothesis of an independent randomly sampled population, random assignment is the desired assignment method because it provides control for all attributes of the members of the samples—in contrast to matching on only one or more variables—and provides the mathematical basis for estimating the likelihood of group equivalence for characteristics one is interested in, both for pretreatment checks on equivalence and the evaluation of post treatment results using inferential statistics. More advanced statistical modeling can be used to adapt the inference to the sampling method. History Randomization was emphasized in the theory of statistical inference of Charles S. Peirce in \\"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\\" (1877–1878) and \\"A Theory of Probable Inference\\" (1883). Peirce applied randomization in the Peirce- Jastrow experiment on weight perception. Charles S. Peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights. Peirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the eighteen- hundreds. Jerzy Neyman advocated randomization in survey sampling (1934) and in experiments (1923). Ronald A. Fisher advocated randomization in his book on experimental design (1935).

The financial products were issued by the Bank of Canada and were intended to offer a competitive rate of interest and had a guaranteed minimum interest rate. History \\"4 Reasons for Buying Victory Bonds\\" by unknown, Canadian Government created, 1917. The Central Powers leaders, shown left to right are: Kaiser Wilhelm II, Franz Joseph, Mehmed VI, and Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. Canada started selling war bonds marketed as \\"Victory Bonds\\" in 1917 to raise money during World War I for the Allies of World War I. Five bond campaigns were held from 1915 to 1919. To advertise the purchasing of Victory Bonds, the Victory Loan Dominion Publicity Committee created artwork, held parades, and had celebrity endorsements. Community members who bought many Victory Bonds were given a Victory Loan Honour Flag as a thank you. The program was revived for World War II. Canada Savings Bonds were first offered in 1945 in an effort to replicate the success of Victory Bonds. In 2004, consultants gave the Department of Finance a report suggesting the CSB program be scrapped, giving an overall program cost savings of about $650 million in 9 years. Then-finance minister Ralph Goodale rejected the recommendation, as the program remained popular, especially with first- time investors, and opted to have the program changed to be more competitive and attract investors. The value of bonds issued declined from $55 billion (Canadian) in 1987 to just over $6 billion in 2015.Ottawa asks Canadians if Canada Savings Bonds are outdated Bill Curry, The Globe and Mail September 27, 2016 A government-commissioned study by KPMG in June 2015 recommended canceling the program. Despite this recommendation, the Department of Finance ruled out cancelling the program despite the estimated $58 million annual cost of running the program. As of October 2016,Liberals consider ending costly Canada Savings Bond program John Paul Tasker, CBC News September 26, 2016 the Liberal government considered ending the program. On March 22, 2017, the federal budget announced its decision to end the sale of new CSBs, saying they would be discontinued in 2017. No further bond purchases will be allowed, however existing bonds will still be honoured until they are redeemed.http://www.budget.gc.ca/2017/docs/plan/chap-04-en.html#Toc477707504 Types of bonds Canada Savings Bonds were available in regular interest, which paid the interest directly to the bond holder, and compounding interest, which added to interest to the principal for the purpose of future interest calculations, only paying when the bond was redeemed. The interest rate was guaranteed for 1 year and could fluctuate with market conditions for the remaining 9 years until its maturity. These bonds were redeemable at any time. Canada Premium Bonds were also a available in regular and compounding interest. These bonds, introduced in 1997, differ from the regular savings bonds in that they were sold with a higher interest rate fixed through the third year; the interest rate would fluctuate for the remaining 7 years with market conditions until its maturity. This greater interest rate stability was considered a premium feature. Conversely, they were only redeemable on the anniversary of the issue date or during the 30 days thereafter. Canada Investment Bonds were non-redeemable until maturity, but were shorter-term bonds with a three-year maturity. They were available only through investment brokers. They were offered from October 1, 2003, and April 1, 2004; only 6 series were issued before their discontinuation.

The strip appeared in the Chicago Tribune for over 50 years. He drew The Teenie Weenies for a total of about 2100 strips. Donahey was a very shy child when growing up. He would dream up imaginary characters and The Teenie Weenies as a pastime. He later turned them into a profession in the form of comic features in newspapers, books and advertising. Biography =Life= Donahey spent much of his childhood alone because he was introverted. One of his pastimes was imagining strange creatures in a small world. He later claimed this was the birth of The Teenie Weenies. His parents, John C. Donahey and Catherine (Chaney) Donahey, noticing his creative work, enrolled him in the Cleveland School of Art. They had hoped that he would follow his older brother James Harrison \\"Hal\\" Donahey (1875–1949) into the illustration business. Donahey graduated from college in 1903, worked briefly in advertising and then joined the staff of Cleveland's The Plain Dealer, where his brother Hal was the political cartoonist. While working for the Plain Dealer he met his wife, Mary Augusta Dickerson, of New York City. They were married on August 16, 1905. She was a columnist and children's book author. Here he specialized in children's cartoons. His wife introduced him to some of the traditional children's stories he had missed when he grew up, such as the Mother Goose rhymes, Alice in Wonderland and Arabian Nights. Donahey liked very much the Mother Goose rhymes and took an interest in them. He not only illustrated children's cartoons but then started illustrating Mother Goose rhymes as well. Soon he refined his writing skills and composed his own poems and stories. =The Teenie Weenies= When Chicago Tribune editor Joseph Medill Patterson saw Donahey's artwork, he offered him a full-time job as a cartoonist for the comics section. Here is where he created The Teenie Weenies inspired by The Brownies, the popular feature by Palmer Cox. The Teenie Weenies, written and illustrated by Donahey, contrasted normal-size objects with tiny protagonists. Donahey's stories consisted of a large illustration and accompanying text about the lives of many characters that lived beneath a rose bush with full-size objects like hats, jugs, and old boots. There was an illustrated story that involved an old rusty tomato can. The first feature appeared in black and white on June 14, 1912. Color was added in 1923 when the comic feature moved to the regular Sunday comics section. Licensing The Teenie Weenies was syndicated in newspapers internationally, and the characters appeared in books, school primers and advertising. Donahey franchised his work for use on decals, dolls, clothing, handkerchiefs and tin boxes. He had a number of licensing agreements for his work with companies like Monarch Foods and Reid-Murdoch. He dedicated most of his work and energy however into the newspaper cartoon comic strips. Donahey was a member of the American Press Humorists and Society of Midland Authors. =Personal life= William and Mary Donahey owned the Pickle Barrel House in Grand Marais, Michigan where they spent their summers. The house has been restored and now serves as a museum on the main street of Grand Marais. Donahey was close friends with Otto E.

The game is based on the original Mega Man series of action-platform games. Mega Man Soccer was released in Japan on February 17, 1994 and in North America in April of that same year. Mega Man Soccer is a traditional soccer game with exhibition matches, tournaments, and leagues that can be played both single-player and multiplayer depending on the mode. The game features characters and Robot Masters from previous entries in the original Mega Man series. Each character has a unique special shot that will temporarily disable anyone that comes in contact with the ball. This aspect of Mega Man Soccer was met with critical praise, but overall reception has been average, particularly due to its perceived poor play control. Plot Mega Man Soccer is set after Mega Man 4. A televised soccer game is interrupted when an explosion occurs on the field. As the smoke clears, all the players are suddenly replaced with several of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters. Having seen the events occur onscreen, the inventor Dr. Light sends his greatest creation, the hero Mega Man, along with some of his own Robot Masters to stop them. The game has no ending. Gameplay The player uses a special attack shot to incapacitate the goalkeeper for an easy score. Mega Man Soccer is a soccer game that allows the player to play as various characters from the Mega Man series including Mega Man, Proto Man, and several Robot Masters. The game features modes of play much like more traditional sports games, such as exhibition matches, tournaments, and leagues. The \\"Exhibition\\" mode lets the player play a single match with a team created using any of the game's 20 characters on one of a dozen themed soccer fields. The \\"Capcom Championship\\" mode can be played either one-player or two-player cooperatively. For the first section of this mode, the player is given a team composed entirely of Mega Man robots, and is tasked with defeating eight teams of Robot Masters in an order of the player's choosing. After beating each team, one member of a team joins the player's team and can then be used, much like how Mega Man can gain the ability of a boss at end of each stage in other entries in the series. After all eight teams are defeated, the player has to defeat several other teams which are faced in a set order in the same way the stages taking place in Dr. Wily's castle—the area that always followed the initial eight boss stages—occur in a set order in other Mega Man games. The \\"Tournament\\" and \\"League\\" modes allow one or two players to pick among nine teams and participate in a tiered schedule of games. Teams that neither player pick must simply be watched. Mega Man Soccer has four statistics in which characters differ from one another in ability: running, kicking, tackling, and defense. These statistics are displayed on screen when the player is given the chance to set a formation at the beginning of a match, or make substitutions at halftime. Controls in Mega Man Soccer mostly mirror that of a more realistic soccer game. Individual buttons are mapped to shooting, passing, slide tackling opposing players, and headbutting or chestbumping the ball depending on its proximity to the player. The one feature that is decidedly dissimilar to anything in realistic soccer is the inclusion of \\"special attacks\\". These shots resemble the abilities used by the characters in other Mega Man games. For example, Cut Man's shot will turn the ball into a pair of cleavers, while Fire Man's shot will set the ball ablaze. Special attacks will temporarily knock down, stun, or otherwise inhibit any character it hits. They generally are much more likely to produce a goal compared to normal shots, but can only be used a few times per game in certain modes. Games consist of two five-minute halves followed by five rounds of penalty kicks if the game remains tied. The clock stops while a goalkeeper has the ball or when the ball is out of bounds. Development Mega Man Soccer was first announced in an interview with Capcom's Senior Vice President Joseph Morici in the March 1993 Game Players magazine. Very little was revealed about the game in the months preceding its Japanese release. Series artist Ryuji Higurashi recalled seeing the characters Guts Man and Heat Man in preview screenshots for Mega Man Soccer. After joining Capcom, he was told by the staff that they planned to include them in a prospective sequel to the game. Guts Man was originally featured as part of a sketch for the game's Japanese cover art; when he was cut from the final draft of the game, he was replaced by Proto Man. Several features found within the game's ROM are noticeably inaccessible from the playable version of the game. These include simultaneous play of up to four players using the SNES Multitap, the ability to play as Dr. Wily (otherwise normally available in Elec Man's and Dust Man's teams in League Mode), and a closing credits sequence. Although little has been said about the game's musical score, the song \\"We Are Rockman\\" by Tatsuo Kamon, used in the Japanese television commercial for Mega Man Soccer, was included on the Rockman Theme Song Collection CD. Reception Mega Man Soccer has met with an overall mediocre critical reception from major gaming publications due to its play control. GamePro found that, aside from the special shots, the game featured sluggish controls, slowdown, and repetitive computer AI. Game Players made similar comments regarding sluggish control and slowdown when too many sprites cover the screen, while Nintendo Power cited poor play control \\"uncharacteristic of Capcom games\\". Local newspaper columnists gave the game more positive reviews, such Michael Pflughoeft of The Milwaukee Journal, who felt the game was very easy to play and that the special attacks would be appealing to younger players. More contemporary retrospectives on the Mega Man series showed mixed opinions on Mega Man Soccer. GamePro ranked the game at number four on its \\"10 Weirdest Sports Games Ever\\". The list compared it to sports games in the Mario series, stating that the latter makes more sense in having only one of each character, unlike Mega Man Soccer, which can have multiple copies of characters on the field at one time. Bill Barnwell of IGN also mentioned a similarity to the Mario series, but mentioned that the lack of excellent gameplay in Mega Man Soccer causes it to be \\"one of the worst soccer games you'll ever play\\". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish contrarily recommended the game, calling it \\"nonsensical, sure, but awfully fun.\\" GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer summarized, \\"Not particularly good or particularly successful, this is a bargain bin curiosity that is an example of weird directions in which to take your mascot.\\" Brett Elston of GamesRadar found it entertaining to dismantle opponent robots using the special attacks.

The group was founded by six women, including Cheri Honkala, and formed in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood in April 1991. KWRU is a part of the national organization the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, a coalition of grassroots organizations, community groups, and non-profit organizations committed to uniting the poor across color lines as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty. KWRU is also a member of the steering committee of the A.N.S.W.E.R. coalition. KWRU was written about in the 1997 book Myth of the Welfare Queen by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Zucchino.  Group activities  KWRU often used direct action tactics such as tent cities and housing takeover to provide housing and dramatize the plight of the homeless. In 1994 KWRU organized the takeover of 12 vacant HUD owned homes in Philadelphia to try to call attention to HUD's failed housing policies.

Barboursville is the birthplace of renowned American military commander and President Zachary Taylor. It also contains Barboursville, the home of James Barbour, the 19th governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, after which the community is named. The ruins of his home are now on land owned by one of the Piedmont region's wineries, Barboursville Vineyards. The Albemarle County portion of Barboursville is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The community is located at the intersection of VA 20 and US 33. In addition to Barboursville, the Madison-Barbour Rural Historic District, Hampstead Farm Archeological District, and Burlington are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Barboursville ruins  On Christmas Day 1884, 62 years after it was built, the Barboursville mansion was consumed by fire. This building was known as the only building in Orange County, Virginia, to be designed by Thomas Jefferson. James Barbour was close friends with Jefferson and owned the building. Jefferson designed the building for Barbour with the former’s own home in mind. The house originally had a race track in front of it, but now it is home to one of Virginia’s first significant wineries. The ruins are now a tourist destination and a backdrop for Four County Players productions of \\"Shakespeare at the Ruins\\" in August.  Barboursville Vineyards  The Barbour family used the landscape where Barboursville Vineyards is located for pastoral farmland from the mid-18th century and through the mid-20th century. The land was preserved by James Barbour most efficiently by rotating crops and having sheep graze the fields. The winery sees their practice as a way to preserve traditional values even through the new Age of Agriculture in Virginia. Government officials, bankers, and land owners made a huge push to plant tobacco at the location of the Barboursville Vineyards. Despite their advice Gianni Zonin, who had been an heir to his family’s wine business in the Veneto, became the owner to the Barbour Plantation in 1976. He dreamed of creating a vineyard on this land despite the fact that Thomas Jefferson attempted the same goal at Monticello and failed for many years. The winery celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2006. In 2007 the vineyard was labeled as one of the best new wine destinations. The region has over 200 wineries and much of their success can be paid to Zonin for starting the business.  Four County Players  Founded in 1973, Four County Players is Central Virginia’s longest continuously operating community theater. For more than forty years, Four County Players has delighted audiences with a full range of theater experiences. Located in the small village of Barboursville, the theater is the cultural hub for the community, serving as both an artistic and educational center. Four County Players is well-known for its masterful musicals, hilarious comedies, and thought-provoking dramas. The group grew out of an idea shared by Lillian Morse and Bill Thomas: “Creative arts need to be a part of the area’s rural communities.” The theater group officially started in January 1973 when a group of ten people gathered at Morse’s home. They pooled their money for start-up costs, and when the take was tallied, the founders had $70 to launch their new enterprise. The first thing they did was set up theater workshops for children at the Gordonsville Recreational Center. This effort produced many new members and two productions: Switched at the Crossroad and Noah’s Flood. Lillian happened to live right next door to the old Barboursville High School auditorium. The vacant schoolhouse had been closed for years and was being used for storage. Through an agreement with Orange County, the theater group reopened the building as the Barboursville Community Center, also known as the home of Four County Players. A few months after moving into its new location, Four County Players showcased its talents in its new home with The Stingy Mr. Pennypincher, directed by Bill Thomas. They did not have time to completely fix up the building before the first show, so they built the set over top of an old furnace that had been left on stage. When the actors had to go backstage, they crawled over the furnace. The TREE Program In 1979, the Players wanted to take on projects that would have a positive and enriching effect in the community, and began the Theater Related Employment Experience Program, also known as the TREE Program. Funded by the Governor’s Manpower Services Council, TREE enabled Four County Players to hire disadvantaged youths and teach them marketable jobs skills directly related to theater. Launching the Scholarship Program In 1980, Ralph and Marcelia Hall, two long-time patrons, wanted to recognize the contributions of the young thespians and technicians who came to share their numerous talents with the community. They started the Four County Players Scholarship program. Proceeds earned by selling refreshments in the Bistro are used to fund the program. Shakespeare at the Ruins In 1990, Sara Smith Bossong proposed the idea of staging Shakespeare plays outdoors. A partnership with Barboursville Vineyard was formed to use the ruins of a mansion on their property as a backdrop for plays. The red brick ruins are what remains of the home Thomas Jefferson designed for James Barbour, the Governor of Virginia from 1812 to 1814. The structure was destroyed by fire on Christmas Day, 1884. Located in the heart of the breathtaking Barboursville Vineyards, the stark — yet stately — ruins, the vineyards, and the high boxwood shrubs surrounding the house served as the backdrop for sixteen years of summer Shakespeare. Sara directed the first Shakespeare at the Ruins production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the summer of 1990. Sadly, due to much-needed renovation and restoration to the continuously deteriorating ruins, the tradition ended in 2006. The final production in the ruins was, fittingly, All’s Well That Ends Well, directed by Clinton Johnston. Not wanting the tradition of Shakespeare to die, the annual production was moved back to the theater building in 2007 for a rousing, creative production of Twelfth Night directed by John Holdren. With Four County Players' main stage closed for the construction of a new back stage and workshop, Shakespeare at the Ruins returns in 2019 — after 13 years — for a special one-summer-only production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream directed by Lydia Underwood Horan. Season Productions Every year, Four County Players presents four to five Mainstage shows. These productions include at least one musical, a straight play, and a family Christmas show. In 2009, the theater opened up a second performance space called the Cellar in the front room of the lower level. The inaugural production was Shakespeare’s Hamlet, directed by Caitlin Lucia for Impulse Project. The Cellar continues to be a perfect venue for smaller productions, experimental works, and special events like the Songs in the Cellar Cabaret series. Four County Players prides itself in producing quality productions that involve volunteers from the community and keep generations of audiences returning for years.  Mining in Barboursville  Residents of the Barboursville community (including an historic free town made up of descendants of former enslaved people of surrounding plantations) were threatened in 2001 by a mining operation proposed by General Shale Product Corp. Also threatened were local businesses, including two wineries. The brick-making company wanted to mine 89 acres of a 139-acre plot in Barboursville. This move was crucial to the company’s business due to the fact their site in Somerset would run out of shale at the end of the year. A group called Friends of Barboursville banded together to speak against the mining at two Planning Commission public hearings. The Friends of Barboursville, and others in the community, fought for over 3 years with the brick-making company, and with the county about how shale mining would be detrimental to the community’s progress. A judge dismissed the case in 2003. The case was then taken to the Virginia Supreme Court who, in January 2005, decided in favor of the plaintiffs, the result being that no mining at the site in question was permitted to go forward.

The group was named after Merioola, a Woollahra mansion where many of its members lived.  Merioola house  Merioola mansion as it appeared in 1911 The group took its name from Merioola, a Victorian-era mansion converted into a boarding house in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra, New South Wales, managed from 1941 by Chica Edgeworth Lowe. Lowe consciously encouraged artists, dancers, writers and theatre people to take up residence, forming the bohemian artistic centre of Sydney in the immediate post-war years. Tenants included the European-born and trained artists Arthur Fleischmann (sculptor), Roland Strasser, Peter Kaiser, Michael Kmit and George de Olszanski. Others, such as Donald Friend, Edgar Ritchard (artist and costume designer), Loudon Sainthill (later to become one of the most prominent theatre designers of the 20th century) and his life partner Harry Tatlock Miller (writer, critic and curator and subsequently the director of the Redfern Galleries, London), had lived and worked overseas. Others connected with the visual arts included photographer Alec Murray, painters Justin O'Brien, Mary Edwards, artist and later noted costume designer Jocelyn Rickards. Other tenants included dancers Alison Lee, Darya Collin, Beatrice Vitringer and Edmee Monod, author and historian Hector Bolitho, architect George Beiers, civil engineer William Pierre Beiers, mathematician and astronomer John Sidgewick, musicians John and Norma Bannenberg, and many others. When in Sydney, Ballet Rambert dancers often spent time at Merioola, where many theatrical and literary collaborations took place.  Merioola and the Sydney Charm School  Although there was no common style or 'movement' at Merioola, it could be said that its artists were more interested in art as a light-hearted and poetic expression of the spirit and less interested in art as a progressive force. Many of the group had spent long years in the armed services or had been displaced persons as a result of the war in Europe. Artists under the label of the \\"Merioola Group\\" exhibited in both Sydney (November 1947) and Melbourne in 1947. Ballet Rambert dancer Walter Gore at Merioola, 1948 The \\"Sydney Charm School\\" was another term used synonymously to refer to the Merioola group of artists because they shared a light-hearted, decorative element in their work. The Sydney Charm School included painters William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, Donald Friend, Lloyd Rees, Justin O'Brien, Jean Bellette, Paul Haefliger, David Strachan, Sali Herman, Eric Wilson, Mary Edwell-Burke, Margaret Olley, Roland Strasser, Peter Kaiser, Harry Tatlock Miller, Jocelyn Rickards, Adrian Feint, Arthur Fleischmann, Eileen Haxton and applied artists Wallace Thornton, Loudon Sainthill and Wolfgang Cardamatis. Paul Haefliger first used the phrase \\"Charm School\\" in 1948 in a review of the work of Jocelyn Rickards. Titled ‘Artist Relies on Charm’, Haefliger's review states that Rickard's work \\"certainly belongs to the charm-school and, as a substitute, it will carry this young artist quite a distance\\". Later, the name \\"The Sydney Charm School\\" was disparagingly used by Australian Art critic Robert Hughes to describe the Merioola group of artists. He believed that the art made in Sydney in the period circa 1940–1955 was less worthy than the works produced in Melbourne as it was decorative and overly romantic, unlike the \\"truthful vital energy of Melbourne\\". Regarding the difference in art expressions between Sydney and Melbourne at that time Donald Friend commented: By its ad hoc nature the Merioola Group were destined not to last, and by the mid-1950s its original members had left or were on the point of leaving, most overseas. But while it lasted Merioola provided a bohemian atmosphere, described by its chronicler Christine France: Notes and references  See also  Art of Australia  External links  * YouTube short documentary about Arthur Fleischmann and life at Merioola * Christine France.

The test taker must, using 16 colored cubes, replicate the patterns displayed on a series of test cards. The design of the test was motivated by a belief that the test could easily be administered to persons with language or hearing disabilities. History The test was developed in 1920 by psychologist Samuel C. Kohs (1890–1984), a student of Lewis Terman, building on earlier and similar designs (such as Francis N. Maxfield's Color Cube Test). Kohs described the 1920s version of the test as a series of 17 cards which increase in complexity as the test progressed. Test takers replicated the designs with painted blocks (each side was a single color or two colors divided by a diagonal line). The initial scores were based on completion time and number of moves. Hutt amended the scoring method to only score completion time. The test was given to both children and adults. As early as the 1930s, the Kohs Block Test was administered at the Ohio School for the Deaf, and at other schools with special needs students. The Kohs Block Design Test has been adapted into sections in several current IQ tests. The Kohs Test continues to be used in research extensively to measure executive functioning and learning, consistent with the original design of the test. This has made the Kohs Block Test useful for assessing the effects of aging, drug use, and in brain research, among other areas. In particular, that the Kohs is a relatively non-verbal test lends it to be used effectively in assessment of those with language issues and in multicultural research settings to reduce the impact of language on assessment of functioning. Patients with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain find successful completion of the task to be extremely difficult, so the test is often used to diagnose right hemisphere damage.

They are all predators and typically range from in length. They are similar in appearance to Corixidae (water boatmen), but can be separated by differences in their dorsal-ventral coloration, front legs, and predatory behavior. Their dorsum is convex, lightly colored without cross striations. Their front tarsi are not scoop-shaped and their hind legs are fringed for swimming. There are about 350 species in two subfamilies: Notonectinae with seven genera, and Anisopinae with four genera. Members in the former subfamily are often larger than those in the latter. Backswimmers swim on their backs, vigorously paddling with their long, hair-fringed hind legs and attack prey as large as tadpoles and small fish. They can inflict a painful \\"bite\\" on a human being, actually a stab with their sharp tubular mouthparts (proboscis). They inhabit still freshwater, e.g. lakes, ponds, marshes, and are sometimes found in garden ponds. Although primarily aquatic, they can fly well and so can disperse easily to new habitats. Common backswimmer (Notonecta glauca) The best-known genus of backswimmers is Notonecta – streamlined, deep-bodied bugs up to long, green, brown, or yellowish in colour. The common backswimmer, N. glauca, is widespread in Europe, including the United Kingdom where it is known as the greater water boatman.BBC Science and nature factfiles: Water boatman, common backswimmer Retrieved on 2008-07-26 Another of the same region, N. maculata, is distinguished by its mottled brick-coloured forewings. In contrast to other aquatic insects that cling to submerged objects, Anisops deanei uses a unique system to stay submerged: using the extra oxygen supply from haemoglobin in their abdomen, instead of using oxygen dissolved in the water. The size of these air bubbles, which provide buoyancy, changes as the nitrogen dissolves into the blood and the oxygen is used in respiration. This allows for regulation of the size of the air bubbles and their concentration of oxygen.physorg.com: Gold Strike in Science World Retrieved on 2008-07-26Diving insects use buoyancy vests New Scientist 2006-04-11 p.19 Retrieved on 2008-07-26 Notes References *Chinery, M.

She was named for Antrim County, Michigan. Construction The first Antrim was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2104, on 18 April 1944, at the Richmond Shipyard, Richmond, California, by Kaiser Cargo, Inc.; launched on 17 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. F. H. Horstman; and, after her delivery to and acceptance by the Navy on 31 October 1944, was commissioned the same day, Lieutenant Glen Martin, USNR, in command. Service history After the completion of her fitting out, Antrim conducted her shakedown training out of San Pedro, California, completing this by 13 December. Subsequently, pushing on for Hawaii, she reached Pearl Harbor on New Year's Day, 1945, but got underway again three days later, bound for the Western Pacific. After calling at Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Kossol Roads, Antrim reached Leyte on 9 February to unload her cargo. Operating under the aegis of Service Squadron 9 through the end of the war with Japan, the vessel carried cargo between Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, and Philippine ports. She conducted three such voyages during the periods from 19 March to 27 April; from 30 May to 22 June; and from 6 to 30 August. After supporting the occupation of Japan through the autumn, Antrim departed the Western Pacific on 4 January 1946 and proceeded singly to the Panama Canal Zone, reaching Cristobal on 20 February. Ultimately, Antrim arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 March where she decommissioned on 3 April. Delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) three days later, Antrims name was struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1946.

On Friday, December 6, 1991, the yogurt shop was robbed and set afire after four teenage girls were murdered inside it. They were 13-year-old Amy Ayers (sometimes spelled Ayres), 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and her 15-year-old sister, Sarah Harbison. Jennifer and Eliza were employees of the store; they were working the evening shift. Sarah and Amy had spent the earlier part of the evening at nearby Northcross Mall, and were looking forward to a sleepover planned for that night. They were in the shop to help Jennifer close it down, and to get a ride home with her afterward. The original investigation spanned nearly eight years. Two men who initially confessed to the quadruple slaying were thereupon tried and convicted; however, they were released from custody in 2009, for lack of evidence. No new charges have been filed, and local media coverage remains ongoing. , the Austin Police Department's cold-case unit continues to pursue the identity of an unknown male, using DNA found on the youngest of the victims. Murders Shortly before midnight on Friday, December 6, 1991, a patrolling Austin police officer noticed a fire coming from an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop and reported it to his dispatcher. After it was extinguished, firefighters discovered four nude bodies. Each had been shot in the head execution style with a .22 lead bullet. Sarah's hands had been bound behind her with a pair of panties and she had also been gagged and raped. Jennifer was not bound but her hands were behind her back. Eliza had been gagged and her hands were also tied behind her back. All three had been severely charred and shot in the back of the head. Unlike the others Amy's body was found in a separate part of the shop. She was not charred but she had received 2nd and \\"very early\\" 3rd degree burns on 25-30% of her body. She was found with a \\"sock-like cloth\\" around her neck. She had been shot the same as the others however the bullet had missed her brain. She also had a second bullet which did severe damage to her brain. It exited through her lateral cheek and jawline. It is thought that the killers had stacked all 4 bodies on top of another but Amy pulled herself off and managed to crawl to a different part of the store. Sarah's and Eliza's bodies were found stacked on top of each other with Jennifer's body next to them which is theorised to have been stacked on top of them but had been disturbed when Amy crawled away. Autopsy results show high levels of a BTU output which suggests an accelerant may have been used. It is believed the girls died before the fire started. Just before the murders, the girls had been seen alive at the yogurt shop as late as 10:00 p.m. They had planned a sleepover for that night. Subsequent events At the time of the murders, a known serial killer, Kenneth Allen McDuff, was in the area. He had a history of multiple murders involving teenagers, but was soon ruled out of the crime. He was executed for his crimes on November 17, 1998. =False confessions= Austin police admit that over fifty people, including McDuff on the day of his execution, had confessed to the yogurt shop murders. A confession in 1992 by two Mexican nationals, held by Mexican authorities, was soon disputed and finally ruled false. =1999: Four suspects arrested= On Wednesday, October 6, 1999, police in Texas and West Virginia arrested four suspects in connection with the murders. Robert Burns Springsteen, Jr., 24, was arrested in Charleston, West Virginia. Michael James Scott, 25, of Buda, Texas, was arrested in the Austin area. Maurice Pierce, 24, was arrested in Lewisville, north of Dallas, and Forrest Wellborn, 23, was picked up in Lockhart, southeast of Austin. The prosecution stated at one hearing that DNA evidence in the case had been tested against more than 70 people (including these four men) and failed to match. Charges against Wellborn were dropped when an Austin grand jury failed to indict him. Charges were later dropped against Pierce. Only the cases against Scott and Springsteen went to trial. The investigation was complicated by matters internal to the Austin Police Department. Detective Hector Polanco was fired for allegedly coercing confessions. A relationship between Springsteen's father and Austin police data-processing employee Karen Huntley prompted her transfer. Polanco was later reinstated after suing the city for discrimination based on race. He would eventually be promoted and retire with a full pension. He was also involved in coercing a false confession in a previous murder case, which led to the false imprisonment of Christopher Ochoa and Richard Danziger. Both were released after 13 years in prison; Danziger was assaulted in prison which resulted in permanent brain damage.\\"Who Killed These Girls? Cold Case: The Yogurt Shop Murders\\". Kirkus Reviews. September 2016. =2006: Springsteen conviction overturned= In 2006, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Springsteen's conviction on the basis of an unfair trial. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate the conviction in February 2007. =2008: Scott and Springsteen request DNA tests= On August 20, 2008, the defense lawyers for Scott and Springsteen requested DNA testing of alternative suspects. No matches against evidence discovered earlier that year were found. Seven jurors from the trials have stated that they would not have convicted the men had this evidence been available at the time.7 jurors say yogurt shop murder votes would change =2009: Release of Scott and Springsteen= On Wednesday, June 24, 2009, Judge Mike Lynch ruled, in response to Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg's request that one of the trials be continued, that defendants Springsteen and Scott be freed on bond pending their upcoming trials. At 2:50 p.m. that day, they both walked out of the Travis County Jail with their attorneys. Later that day, Lehmberg responded to Lynch's decision with the following statement: :Today I requested a continuance in the case against Michael Scott, a defendant in the yogurt shop murders, whose trial was scheduled to begin on July 6. Judge Mike Lynch granted that motion but also released both Michael Scott and Robert Springsteen on personal bond, as he indicated he would do in his previous scheduling order. :Requesting a delay in the case was a difficult decision but one that I believe is the best course toward an ultimate successful prosecution of this important matter. :Knowing that Judge Lynch would release both defendants, we requested certain conditions on their bonds, requiring them to remain in Travis County and report to the Court any change of residence, to have no contact with the victims' families or witnesses, that they not carry weapons or consume alcohol or illegal drugs, that they report to the Court on a routine basis, and attend all court appearances. :As you know, both Springsteen and Scott were convicted by juries in June 2001 and September 2002. Their convictions were then overturned by the appellate court, but their statements to law enforcement were found to be voluntarily given. :Since the original trial of these two men, new developments in DNA technology have become available. As we prepared for retrial, in March 2008, we submitted various evidentiary items for what is called YSTR testing. This test looks for male DNA only and is deemed to be the most accurate test for samples that are mixtures of female and male DNA, as in this case. :We sought this testing because we have an ongoing duty and responsibility to use the most up to date science available, to seek the truth in this and all the cases we prosecute. :Currently, it is clear to me that our evidence in the death of these four young women includes DNA from one male whose identity is not yet known to us. The defense asserts that the testing reveals more than one unknown male, but the evidence presented at the hearing on Thursday, June 18 contradicts that notion. :The reliable scientific evidence in the case presents one, and one only, unknown male donor. Given that, I could not in good conscience allow this case to go to trial before the identity of this male donor is determined, and the full truth is known. I remain confident that both Springsteen and Scott are responsible for the deaths at the yogurt shop, but it would not be prudent to risk a trial until we also know the nature of the involvement of this unknown male. :My office and the Austin Police Department remain committed to these cases. Their further investigation will continue to be a priority. My commitment to the victims, their families, and this community is that we will not give up until all of the people responsible for these terrible and tragic murders are brought to justice. On October 28, 2009, all charges were dismissed against Scott and Springsteen. =2010: Death of Maurice Pierce= On December 23, 2010, Austin police officer Frank Wilson and his rookie partner, Bradley Smith, conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Maurice Pierce - one of the four originally arrested in this case - in the northern part of the city. After a brief foot pursuit, Pierce struggled with Wilson before removing a knife from his belt and stabbing Wilson in the neck. Wilson, who survived his injuries, subsequently pulled out his gun and shot and killed Pierce.Yogurt shop suspect dies in shooting Book The murders were the subject of Beverly Lowry's 2016 nonfiction book Who Killed These Girls?

It consisted of normal-size objects intermingled with tiny protagonists. The comic strip characters were two inches tall and lived under a rose bush. They lived with \\"real world\\" size materials made from discarded objects like hats, jars, barrels, kegs, and boxes – all of which were gigantic to them. History The Teenie Weenies in the Wildwood by William Donahey, 1923 The strip was inspired by Palmer Cox's The Brownies and was done in the form of text with a single large picture. Unlike the Brownies where the text was written in verse, Donahey wrote in prose. The Teenie Weenies first appeared in black and white in the women's section of the Chicago Tribune on June 14, 1914. This first story was of the Top Hat house burning down. The comic strip ran as a one panel story with a picture until 1923. It then moved to the comics page as a strip cartoon. Color versions soon appeared in the magazine section of the newspaper printed in rotogravure. Donahey drew the comic strip until October 26, 1924 when it was then temporarily discontinued. Donahey's comic characters then went into advertising when the newspaper feature was stopped. It was then a symbol for Reid Murdock. Donahey did advertising for them in The Saturday Evening Post and on their Monarch canned foods line. Several books of the strip comic characters were also published by Beckley- Cardey Company and Reilly & Lee. In an effort to stimulate new interest in the Teenie Weenies, Reid Murdock and Company in 1927 issued an eight-page pamphlet called The Teenie Weenies: Their Book. On September 24, 1933, the daily comic strip was added again to the Chicago Tribune newspaper. It went then only for about a year and was suspended again on December 2, 1934. In 1940 and 1941 four of The Teenie Weenies books were reprinted. On May 18, 1941, the Sunday comic strip feature came back permanently. It continued until Donahey's death. During this third time that it was published, two sets of reprints came out. Whittlesy House published three books between 1942 and 1945. Ziff-Davis published two standard-size comic books in 1950 and 1951. Donahey retired in 1969. The last newspaper comic strip episode appeared February 15, 1970. Donahey died February 2 of the same year and never saw the last episode published. Characters Donahey's comic strip characters tended to be named after their most prominent characteristics, examples being the Sailor, the Chinese man, the Cook, the Policeman, the Lady of Fashion, the Dunce, the Old Soldier with a Wooden Leg, etc. Each character had a personality accordingly which was not just based on their clothing. According to John D. Taylor, a founding member of the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, there were 45 members of the Teenie Weenie village. Below is Taylor's list of the Teenie Weenies. thumb thumb thumb 1\\\\. Aunt Tess: 6/18/1961 - 1970. White- haired workaholic and domineering old bat.

The Commission's primary responsibility is the regulation of British Columbia's natural gas and electricity utilities. They also regulate intra-provincial pipelines and the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC), a crown corporation responsible for insuring vehicles and operators in the province. Apart from rates and services, the BCUC is also responsible for ensuring that shareholders of utilities are afforded a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on their invested capital, that competitive interests are not frustrated, and that government energy policy is practically implemented. In addition, it approves the development of infrastructure planned by utilities and their issuance of securities, establishes tolls and conditions of service for intraprovincial oil pipelines, and has responsibility for electric power transmission facilities and energy supply contracts. The BCUC also reviews energy-related matters referred to it by Cabinet, which usually involve public hearings, followed by a report and recommendations to Cabinet. With respect to ICBC, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that service to basic automobile insurance policyholders is adequate, efficient, just and reasonable, and that ICBC optional insurance is not subsidized by other ICBC operations. The BCUC has quasi-judicial responsibilities, and may make legally binding rulings (subject to court appeal). It is governed by its enabling statute, the Utilities Commission Act, other legislation and regulations including the Administrative Tribunals Act, Pipeline Act, and — with respect to ICBC — provisions of the Insurance Corporation Act. The BCUC works to maintain processes that are fair, transparent and inclusive. The BCUC values input from British Columbians, and is committed to issuing well-reasoned, evidence-based decisions. In addition to its regulatory responsibilities, the Commission provides the following services and assistance: * reviews ratepayers' complaints about the actions of utilities; * provides copies of documentation prepared by the Commission; * provides access to regulated utilities' tariffs and information filed in public hearings; * responds to requests for general information regarding utilities. The Commission has been self-funded since 1988. Its annual budget ranges from $4.6 to $4.7 million, with its costs recovered primarily through a levy on the energy utilities and pipelines companies that it regulates. The BCUC describes its mission as follows: The BCUC's mission is to ensure that ratepayers receive safe, reliable and non-discriminatory energy services at fair rates from the utilities it regulates, and that shareholders of those utilities are afforded a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on their invested capital.

It occurred during a heavy thunderstorm at the Katzbach river between Wahlstatt and Liegnitz in the Prussian province of Silesia.Kelly, C., 1831., History of the French Revolution: And of the Wars Produced by that ... Event ... Including a Complete Account of the War Between Great Britain and America; and the ... Battle of Waterloo. London. Thomas Kelly. p.702 To which are Appended, Biographical Sketches of the Heroes of Waterloo Taking place the same day as the Battle of Dresden, it resulted in a Coalition victory, with the French retreating to Saxony. Prelude Blücher ordered the Army of Silesia to advance on 13 August, before the Truce of Pläswitz could conclude on 17 August. In a series of running fights, the Allied army beat back the confused French, who did not anticipate that the Allies would break the armistice so brazenly. These minor victories raised the morale of the inexperienced German levies. On the first day, Blücher and his chief of staff August Neidhardt von Gneisenau became separated and did not issue orders for troop movements until late in the day, slowing down the Allied advance. The French resistance grew in intensity, the Allied night marches multiplied owing to constant combat and delays, and the weather turned atrocious. On 20 August, Blücher's men came face-to-face Napoleon's main army at the Bober river and beat a hasty retreat when the cheers of the French troops announced the arrival of the French emperor. For the next five days, the Silesian Army engaged in a series of fierce and costly rearguard actions against the pursuing French forces, which were personally commanded by Napoleon. Blücher lost 6,000–8,000 men in combat on 21, 22 and 23 August, while French losses since 17 August were about the same. Blücher's army began to fall apart. Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's corps lost 5,000 men to desertion. The Landwehr militiamen deserted en masse in entire battalions, while the Allied corps commanders complained of the ruin befalling their army thanks to the incompetence of its general staff. Blücher contemplated firing Gneisenau. Napoleon returned to Saxony on 23 August with the Guard, I Corps, VI Corps and I Cavalry Corps to face Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia. That same day, he formed the 100,000-strong Army of the Bober under Marshal Jacques MacDonald's and ordered him to drive Blucher to east of the Katzbach then pull back to the west bank of the Bober and assume defensive positions to protect the flank of the French armies in Saxony and near Berlin. MacDonald was also authorized to attack in case Blücher took the offensive. MacDonald did not move for 48 hours due to Marshal Michael Ney's misunderstanding of Napoleon's summon of Ney to Görlitz as referring to his entire three-division-strong III Corps. Late on 24 August, Ney turned over command to Joseph Souham, who spent 25 August moving his corps into MacDonald's line. In addition to the III Corps, MacDonald had under his command the V Corps, XI Corps and II Cavalry Corps. When Blücher on 24 August learned that Napoleon was no longer in direct command of the pursuers, he at 7 pm that day ordered his army to turn back and use cavalry reconnaissance to find the enemy on 25 August. At 11 pm on 25 August, MacDonald issued orders to move his army to the town of Jauer the next day and defeat Blücher or drive him deeper into Silesia. MacDonald's courier reached Souham four and one-half hours late. Souham then moved his corps at 11.30 am to Kroitsch rather than Liegnitz, which meant that only one division from the corps would participate in the battle. Battle Battle of Katzbach by Klein. Prussian troops force the French into the river. The two armies stumbled upon one another at 9 am after MacDonald crossed the swollen Katzbach river. A sudden flood cut away many of the bridges and destroyed the fords. In the midst of the confusion and heavy rain, MacDonald seemed to recover first. Although his orders were to defend the flank of Napoleon's main force from Blücher, MacDonald decided to attack. He dispatched two-thirds of his army, about 60,000 men, in an attempt to flank the Russo-Prussian right. But confusion reigned again as the French columns found themselves too far apart to support one another. Blücher ordered his right-wing to advance. The muskets were too wet for firing and the battle was decided with cold steel. The remaining 30,000 men of MacDonald's force, who were supposed to hold down the Coalition forces, were met by a heavy counter-attack by Prussian cavalry. Without support or reinforcement, the French II Cavalry Corps, Brayer's 8th Division from III Corps and Meunier's 2nd brigade were routed at 6.30 pm by Blücher's entire army. The remnants of MacDonald's army retreated, with hundreds drowning in the Katzbach and the Raging Neisse which were in spate. Aftermath =Casualties= MacDonald's casualties on 26 August are unknown but by 1 September he had lost 30,000 men and 103 guns, including 12,000 killed and wounded and 18,000 captured. Blücher's losses were some 1,000 men killed and wounded. =Analysis= Beyond the battle losses, the French strategic position had been weakened. Austria had been planning to defect from the Allied coalition after Napoleon's great victory at Dresden on 26–27 August. News of Blücher's triumph revitalized the worried Allied leadership. This, coupled with the defeats at Kulm, four days later, and Dennewitz on 6 September, would more than negate Napoleon's victory at Dresden. Because of his victory, Blücher received the title of \\"Prince of Wahlstatt\\" on 3 June 1814. The battle gave rise to a German saying, now obsolete: \\"Der geht ran wie Blücher an der Katzbach!\\" (\\"He's advancing like Blücher at Katzbach!\\"), referring to Blücher and describing vigorous, forceful behavior.

It was subsequently taken to Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. It was eventually discovered on the grounds of Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, prompting a Korean outcry that it be returned. In a ceremony on 12 October 2005, it was turned over to officials from South Korea, who returned it to its original location, which is now in North Korea. The Korean name is commonly translated as great victory at Pukkwan. It is often referred to as the Bukgwan Victory Monument in South Korea. Creation The Seven-Year War resulted from two Japanese invasions, in 1592 and 1597. The Koreans and their Chinese allies drove back the invasion but the bitter war was a disaster for the country. During the initial invasion, Korean general Jeong Mun-bu formed a volunteer army that won eight victories between 1592 and 1594 against an army of 20,000 Japanese led by General Katō Kiyomasa in the Hamgwallyong Pass area of Hamgyong Province, during Kato's Hamgyong campaign. In 1707, Send-off Ceremony for Joseon Monument Due Tues. , KBS News, 27 February 2006 King Sukjong ordered the creation of a monument commemorating the victories. The 187 cm tall and 66 cm wide stela has 1500 characters detailing the actions of the volunteer army. It was erected in Kilju county, North Hamgyong Province, where it stood for the next two hundred years. Removal to Japan During the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, much of the Korean peninsula was under the occupation of the Imperial Japanese Army. The monument, located at Immyong Station, came to the attention of Major General Ikeda who was stationed in the area. Apparently displeased by it, he allowed Lieutenant General Miyoshi to take the monument home to Japan. It was placed in a Japanese imperial museum before being moved into the woods in the grounds of Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto shrine honoring Japan's war dead. There it stood in obscurity for three-quarters of a century, forgotten by both the Japanese and Koreans. In 1969, Choe Myo-myeon, the director of the International Institute of Korean Studies in Tokyo came across the monument. In the meantime, Yasukuni Shrine had become a focus of controversy after several Class A war criminals of the Second World War had been honored there. Many Koreans were outraged to learn that a Korean victory monument over a Japanese invasion now stood on the grounds of a Japanese shrine seen as commemorating the militarism that had caused immense suffering in Korea. Negotiations Despite requests by the South Korean government and civic groups that the monument be returned, Japan refused, stating that doing so violated their principle of \\"separation of religion and politics\\" and that as the monument originally stood in what was now North Korea, South Korea was not in a position to negotiate its return. The deadlock was finally broken in December 2004, when Buddhist monks from North and South Korea agreed to work together to retrieve the monument. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae Chan and North Korean president of the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium Kim Yong Nam discussed the issue at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia in April 2005. This led to further talks at the 15th inter-Korean Cabinet-level meeting in Seoul. These talks marked the monument as a major issue of inter-Korean cooperation, removed the Japanese objection about the confusion caused by a divided Korea, and led to their agreement to return the monument. On 12 October 2005, a brief ceremony attended by priests of the shrine, representatives of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and officials from the embassy of South Korea was held at the monument to turn over control. South Korea briefly put the monument on display at Gyeongbok Palace in Seoul.Joseon Monument Put on Public Display , KBS News, 17 November 2006 On 28 February 2006, a ceremony was held before the tomb of General Jeong Mun-bu in Gyeonggi Province before its return north.

In languages with a stress accent (accentual verse), it is the equivalent of pentameter with iambs or trochees (particularly iambic pentameter). Medieval French heroic epics (the chansons de geste) were most often composed in 10 syllable verses (from which, the decasyllable was termed \\"heroic verse\\"), generally with a regular caesura after the fourth syllable. (The medieval French romance (roman) was, however, most often written in 8 syllable (or octosyllable) verse.) Use of the 10 syllable line in French poetry was eclipsed by the 12 syllable alexandrine line, particularly after the 16th century. Paul Valéry's great poem \\"The Graveyard by the Sea\\" (Le Cimetière marin) is, however, written in decasyllables. Similarly, South Slavic and in particular Serbian epic poetry sung with the accompaniment of the gusle is traditionally sung in the decasyllabic verse. In 19th-century Italian opera, this form was often employed in the libretto. Noting its use in the operas of Giuseppe Verdi, musicologist Philip Gossett describes the composer's request to the librettist for his opera Macbeth, Francesco Maria Piave, as follows: \\"I'd like to do a chorus as important as the one in Nabucco, but I wouldn't want it to have the same rhythm, and that's why I ask you for ottonari\\" [8 syllables; and then Gossett continues] “Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate” from Nabucco, “O Signore del tetto natio” from I Lombardi, and “Si ridesti il Leon di Castiglia” from Ernani all employ the poetic meter of decasillabi.Gossett, p. 286 Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, utilized this poetic form. Chaucer evolved this meter into iambs, or the alternating pattern of five stressed and unstressed syllables made famous by Shakespeare. Because Chaucer's Middle English included many unstressed vowels at the end of words which later became silent, his poetry includes a greater number of hendecassylables than that of Modern English poets.

This is achieved by creating a periodic variation in the refractive index of the fiber core, which generates a wavelength-specific dielectric mirror. A fiber Bragg grating can therefore be used as an inline optical filter to block certain wavelengths, or as a wavelength-specific reflector. Figure 1: A Fiber Bragg Grating structure, with refractive index profile and spectral response History The first in-fiber Bragg grating was demonstrated by Ken Hill in 1978. Initially, the gratings were fabricated using a visible laser propagating along the fiber core. In 1989, Gerald Meltz and colleagues demonstrated the much more flexible transverse holographic inscription technique where the laser illumination came from the side of the fiber. This technique uses the interference pattern of ultraviolet laser light to create the periodic structure of the fiber Bragg grating. Manufacture Fiber Bragg gratings are created by \\"inscribing\\" or \\"writing\\" systematic (periodic or aperiodic) variation of refractive index into the core of a special type of optical fiber using an intense ultraviolet (UV) source such as a UV laser. Two main processes are used: interference and masking. The method that is preferable depends on the type of grating to be manufactured. Normally a germanium-doped silica fiber is used in the manufacture of fiber Bragg gratings. The germanium-doped fiber is photosensitive, which means that the refractive index of the core changes with exposure to UV light. The amount of the change depends on the intensity and duration of the exposure as well as the photosensitivity of the fiber. To write a high reflectivity fiber Bragg grating directly in the fiber the level of doping with germanium needs to be high. However, standard fibers can be used if the photosensitivity is enhanced by pre-soaking the fiber in hydrogen. More recently, fiber Bragg gratings have also been written in polymer fibers, this is described in the PHOSFOS entry.http://www.phosfos.eu/eng/Phosfos/Journals/Bragg-grating-in-polymer- optical-fiber-for-strain-bend-and-temperature-sensing =Interference= This was the first method used widely for the fabrication of fiber Bragg gratings and uses two-beam interference. Here the UV laser is split into two beams which interfere with each other creating a periodic intensity distribution along the interference pattern. The refractive index of the photosensitive fiber changes according to the intensity of light that it is exposed to. This method allows for quick and easy changes to the Bragg wavelength, which is directly related to the interference period and a function of the incident angle of the laser light. =Sequential writing= Complex grating profiles can be manufactured by exposing a large number of small, partially overlapping gratings in sequence. Advanced properties such as phase shifts and varying modulation depth can be introduced by adjusting the corresponding properties of the subgratings.R. Stubbe, B. Sahlgren, S. Sandgren, and A. Asseh, \\"Novel technique for writing long superstructured fiber Bragg gratings,\\" in Postdeadlin Papers, Photosensitivity and Quadratic Nonlinearity in Glass Waveguides: Fundamentals and Applications, Vol. 22of 1995 Technical Digest Series (Optical Society of America, Washington, D.C., 1995), p. PD 1. In the first version of the method, subgratings were formed by exposure with UV pulses, but this approach had several drawbacks, such as large energy fluctuations in the pulses and low average power. A sequential writing method with continuous UV radiation that overcomes these problems has been demonstrated and is now used commercially. The photosensitive fiber is translated by an interferometrically controlled airbearing borne carriage. The interfering UV beams are focused onto the fiber, and as the fiber moves, the fringes move along the fiber by translating mirrors in an interferometer. As the mirrors have a limited range, they must be reset every period, and the fringes move in a sawtooth pattern. All grating parameters are accessible in the control software, and it is therefore possible to manufacture arbitrary gratings structures without any changes in the hardware. =Photomask= A photomask having the intended grating features may also be used in the manufacture of fiber Bragg gratings. The photomask is placed between the UV light source and the photosensitive fiber. The shadow of the photomask then determines the grating structure based on the transmitted intensity of light striking the fiber. Photomasks are specifically used in the manufacture of chirped Fiber Bragg gratings, which cannot be manufactured using an interference pattern. =Point-by-point= A single UV laser beam may also be used to 'write' the grating into the fiber point-by-point. Here, the laser has a narrow beam that is equal to the grating period. The main difference of this method lies in the interaction mechanisms between infrared laser radiation and dielectric material - multiphoton absorption and tunnel ionization. This method is specifically applicable to the fabrication of long period fiber gratings. Point-by-point is also used in the fabrication of tilted gratings. =Production= Originally, the manufacture of the photosensitive optical fiber and the 'writing' of the fiber Bragg grating were done separately. Today, production lines typically draw the fiber from the preform and 'write' the grating, all in a single stage. As well as reducing associated costs and time, this also enables the mass production of fiber Bragg gratings. Mass production is in particular facilitating applications in smart structures utilizing large numbers (3000) of embedded fiber Bragg gratings along a single length of fiber. Theory Figure 2: FBG reflected power as a function of wavelength The fundamental principle behind the operation of an FBG is Fresnel reflection, where light traveling between media of different refractive indices may both reflect and refract at the interface. The refractive index will typically alternate over a defined length. The reflected wavelength (\\\\scriptstyle \\\\lambda_B), called the Bragg wavelength, is defined by the relationship, :\\\\lambda_B = 2 n_e \\\\Lambda\\\\, where \\\\scriptstyle n_e is the effective refractive index of the grating in the fiber core and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Lambda is the grating period. The effective refractive index quantifies the velocity of propagating light as compared to its velocity in vacuum. \\\\scriptstyle n_e depends not only on the wavelength but also (for multimode waveguides) on the mode in which the light propagates. For this reason, it is also called modal index. The wavelength spacing between the first minima (nulls, see Fig. 2), or the bandwidth (\\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta\\\\lambda), is (in the strong grating limit) given by, :\\\\Delta \\\\lambda=\\\\left[\\\\frac{2 \\\\delta n_0 \\\\eta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right]\\\\lambda_B where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\delta n_0 is the variation in the refractive index (\\\\scriptstyle n_3 \\\\,-\\\\, n_2), and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\eta is the fraction of power in the core. Note that this approximation does not apply to weak gratings where the grating length, \\\\scriptstyle L_g, is not large compared to \\\\scriptstyle \\\\lambda_B \\\\ \\\\scriptstyle \\\\delta n_0. The peak reflection (\\\\scriptstyle P_B(\\\\lambda_B)) is approximately given by, :P_B(\\\\lambda_B) \\\\approx \\\\tanh^2 \\\\left[\\\\frac{N \\\\eta (V) \\\\delta n_0}{n}\\\\right] where \\\\scriptstyle N is the number of periodic variations. The full equation for the reflected power (\\\\scriptstyle P_B(\\\\lambda)), is given by, : P_B(\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac {\\\\sinh^2\\\\left[\\\\eta (V) \\\\delta n_0 \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\Gamma^2} \\\\frac{N \\\\Lambda}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right]} {\\\\cosh^2\\\\left[\\\\eta (V) \\\\delta n_0 \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\Gamma^2} \\\\frac{N \\\\Lambda}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right] - \\\\Gamma^2} where, :\\\\Gamma (\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta (V) \\\\delta n_0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda_B} - 1\\\\right] Types of gratings The term type in this context refers to the underlying photosensitivity mechanism by which grating fringes are produced in the fiber. The different methods of creating these fringes have a significant effect on physical attributes of the produced grating, particularly the temperature response and ability to withstand elevated temperatures. Thus far, five (or six) types of FBG have been reported with different underlying photosensitivity mechanisms.J. Canning, Fiber Gratings and Devices for Sensors and Lasers, Lasers and Photonics Reviews, 2 (4), 275-289, Wiley, USA (2008) These are summarized below: =Standard, or type I, gratings= Written in both hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated fiber of all types, type I gratings are usually known as standard gratings and are manufactured in fibers of all types under all hydrogenation conditions. Typically, the reflection spectra of a type I grating is equal to 1-T where T is the transmission spectra. This means that the reflection and transmission spectra are complementary and there is negligible loss of light by reflection into the cladding or by absorption. Type I gratings are the most commonly used of all grating types, and the only types of grating available off-the-shelf at the time of writing. =Type IA gratings= * Regenerated grating written after erasure of a type I grating in hydrogenated germanosilicate fiber of all types Type IA gratings were first observed in 2001 during experiments designed to determine the effects of hydrogen loading on the formation of IIA gratings in germanosilicate fiber. In contrast to the anticipated decrease (or 'blue shift') of the gratings' Bragg wavelength, a large increase (or 'red shift') was observed. Later work showed that the increase in Bragg wavelength began once an initial type I grating had reached peak reflectivity and begun to weaken. For this reason, it was labeled as a regenerated grating. Determination of the type IA gratings' temperature coefficient showed that it was lower than a standard grating written under similar conditions. The key difference between the inscription of type IA and IIA gratings is that IA gratings are written in hydrogenated fibers, whereas type IIA gratings are written in non-hydrogenated fibers. =Type IIA, or type In, gratings= * These are gratings that form as the negative part of the induced index change overtakes the positive part. It is usually associated with gradual relaxation of induced stress along the axis and/or at the interface. It has been proposed that these gratings could be relabeled type In (for type 1 gratings with a negative index change; type II label could be reserved for those that are distinctly made above the damage threshold of the glass).For a contemporary review, see J. Canning, Fiber Gratings and Devices for Sensors and Lasers, Lasers and Photonics Reviews, 2 (4), 275-289, Wiley, USA (2008) Later research by Xie et al. showed the existence of another type of grating with similar thermal stability properties to the type II grating. This grating exhibited a negative change in the mean index of the fiber and was termed type IIA. The gratings were formed in germanosilicate fibers with pulses from a frequency doubled XeCl pumped dye laser. It was shown that initial exposure formed a standard (type I) grating within the fiber which underwent a small red shift before being erased. Further exposure showed that a grating reformed which underwent a steady blue shift whilst growing in strength. =Regenerated gratings= These are gratings that are reborn at higher temperatures after erasure of gratings, usually type I gratings and usually, though not always, in the presence of hydrogen. They have been interpreted in different ways including dopant diffusion (oxygen being the most popular current interpretation) and glass structural change. Recent work has shown that there exists a regeneration regime beyond diffusion where gratings can be made to operate at temperatures in excess of 1,295 °C, outperforming even type II femtosecond gratings. These are extremely attractive for ultra high temperature applications. =Type II gratings= * Damage written gratings inscribed by multiphoton excitation with higher intensity lasers that exceed the damage threshold of the glass. Lasers employed are usually pulsed in order to reach these intensities. They include recent developments in multiphoton excitation using femtosecond pulses where the short timescales (commensurate on a timescale similar to local relaxation times) offer unprecedented spatial localization of the induced change. The amorphous network of the glass is usually transformed via a different ionization and melting pathway to give either higher index changes or create, through micro-explosions, voids surrounded by more dense glass. Archambault et al. showed that it was possible to inscribe gratings of ~100% (>99.8%) reflectance with a single UV pulse in fibers on the draw tower. The resulting gratings were shown to be stable at temperatures as high as 800 °C (up to 1,000 °C in some cases, and higher with femtosecond laser inscription). The gratings were inscribed using a single 40 mJ pulse from an excimer laser at 248 nm. It was further shown that a sharp threshold was evident at ~30 mJ; above this level the index modulation increased by more than two orders of magnitude, whereas below 30 mJ the index modulation grew linearly with pulse energy. For ease of identification, and in recognition of the distinct differences in thermal stability, they labeled gratings fabricated below the threshold as type I gratings and above the threshold as type II gratings. Microscopic examination of these gratings showed a periodic damage track at the grating’s site within the fiber [10]; hence type II gratings are also known as damage gratings. However, these cracks can be very localized so as to not play a major role in scattering loss if properly prepared. Grating structure Figure 3: Structure of the refractive index change in a uniform FBG (1), a chirped FBG (2), a tilted FBG (3), and a superstructure FBG (4). Figure 4: Refractive index profile in the core of, 1) a uniform positive-only FBG, 2) a Gaussian-apodized FBG, 3) a raised-cosine-apodized FBG with zero-dc change, and 4) a discrete phase shift FBG. The structure of the FBG can vary via the refractive index, or the grating period. The grating period can be uniform or graded, and either localised or distributed in a superstructure. The refractive index has two primary characteristics, the refractive index profile, and the offset. Typically, the refractive index profile can be uniform or apodized, and the refractive index offset is positive or zero. There are six common structures for FBGs; # uniform positive-only index change, # Gaussian apodized, # raised-cosine apodized, # chirped, # discrete phase shift, and # superstructure. The first complex grating was made by J. Canning in 1994.J. Canning, M. G. Sceats, \\"p-phase-shifted periodic distributed structures in germanosilicate fiber by UV post-processing\\", Electron. Lett., 30, (16), 1344-1345, (1994) This supported the development of the first distributed feedback (DFB) fiber lasers, and also laid the groundwork for most complex gratings that followed, including the sampled gratings first made by Peter Hill and colleagues in Australia. =Apodized gratings= There are basically two quantities that control the properties of the FBG. These are the grating length, \\\\scriptstyle L_g, given as :L_g = N\\\\Lambda\\\\, and the grating strength, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\delta n_0 \\\\eta. There are, however, three properties that need to be controlled in a FBG. These are the reflectivity, the bandwidth, and the side-lobe strength. As shown above, in the strong grating limit (i.e., for large \\\\scriptstyle \\\\delta n_0) the bandwidth depends on the grating strength, and not the grating length. This means the grating strength can be used to set the bandwidth. The grating length, effectively \\\\scriptstyle N, can then be used to set the peak reflectivity, which depends on both the grating strength and the grating length. The result of this is that the side-lobe strength cannot be controlled, and this simple optimisation results in significant side-lobes. A third quantity can be varied to help with side-lobe suppression. This is apodization of the refractive index change. The term apodization refers to the grading of the refractive index to approach zero at the end of the grating. Apodized gratings offer significant improvement in side-lobe suppression while maintaining reflectivity and a narrow bandwidth. The two functions typically used to apodize a FBG are Gaussian and raised-cosine. =Chirped fiber Bragg gratings= The refractive index profile of the grating may be modified to add other features, such as a linear variation in the grating period, called a chirp. The reflected wavelength changes with the grating period, broadening the reflected spectrum. A grating possessing a chirp has the property of adding dispersion—namely, different wavelengths reflected from the grating will be subject to different delays. This property has been used in the development of phased-array antenna systems and polarization mode dispersion compensation, as well. =Tilted fiber Bragg gratings= In standard FBGs, the grading or variation of the refractive index is along the length of the fiber (the optical axis), and is typically uniform across the width of the fiber. In a tilted FBG (TFBG), the variation of the refractive index is at an angle to the optical axis. The angle of tilt in a TFBG has an effect on the reflected wavelength, and bandwidth. =Long-period gratings= Typically the grating period is the same size as the Bragg wavelength, as shown above. For a grating that reflects at 1,500 nm, the grating period is 500 nm, using a refractive index of 1.5. Longer periods can be used to achieve much broader responses than are possible with a standard FBG. These gratings are called long-period fiber grating. They typically have grating periods on the order of 100 micrometers, to a millimeter, and are therefore much easier to manufacture. =Phase-shifted fiber Bragg gratings= Phase-shifted fiber Bragg gratings (PS-FBGs) are an important class of gratings structures which have interesting applications in optical communications and sensing due to their special filtering characteristics. These types of gratings can be reconfigurable through special packaging and system design. Different coatings of diffractive structure are used for fiber Bragg gratings in order to reduce the mechanical impact on the Bragg wavelength shift for 1.1–15 times as compared to an uncoated waveguide. = Addressed fiber Bragg structures = Addressed fiber Bragg structures (AFBS) is an emerging class of FBGs developed in order to simplify interrogation and enhance performance of FBG-based sensors. The optical frequency response of an AFBS has two narrowband notches with the frequency spacing between them being in the radio frequency (RF) range. The frequency spacing is called the address frequency of AFBS and is unique for each AFBS in a system. The central wavelength of AFBS can be defined without scanning its spectral response, unlike conventional FBGs that are probed by optoelectronic interrogators. An interrogation circuit of AFBS is significantly simplified in comparison with conventional interrogators and consists of a broadband optical source, an optical filter with a predefined linear inclined frequency response, and a photodetector. Applications =Communications= Figure 5: Optical add-drop multiplexer. The primary application of fiber Bragg gratings is in optical communications systems. They are specifically used as notch filters. They are also used in optical multiplexers and demultiplexers with an optical circulator, or optical add- drop multiplexer (OADM). Figure 5 shows 4 channels, depicted as 4 colours, impinging onto a FBG via an optical circulator. The FBG is set to reflect one of the channels, here channel 4. The signal is reflected back to the circulator where it is directed down and dropped out of the system. Since the channel has been dropped, another signal on that channel can be added at the same point in the network. A demultiplexer can be achieved by cascading multiple drop sections of the OADM, where each drop element uses an FBG set to the wavelength to be demultiplexed. Conversely, a multiplexer can be achieved by cascading multiple add sections of the OADM. FBG demultiplexers and OADMs can also be tunable. In a tunable demultiplexer or OADM, the Bragg wavelength of the FBG can be tuned by strain applied by a piezoelectric transducer. The sensitivity of a FBG to strain is discussed below in fiber Bragg grating sensors. =Fiber Bragg grating sensors= As well as being sensitive to strain, the Bragg wavelength is also sensitive to temperature. This means that fiber Bragg gratings can be used as sensing elements in optical fiber sensors. In a FBG sensor, the measurand causes a shift in the Bragg wavelength, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta \\\\lambda_B. The relative shift in the Bragg wavelength, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta \\\\lambda_B/\\\\lambda_B, due to an applied strain (\\\\scriptstyle \\\\epsilon) and a change in temperature (\\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta T) is approximately given by, :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\lambda_B}{\\\\lambda_B}\\\\right] = C_S\\\\epsilon + C_T\\\\Delta T or, :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\lambda_B}{\\\\lambda_B}\\\\right] = (1-p_e)\\\\epsilon + (\\\\alpha_\\\\Lambda + \\\\alpha_n)\\\\Delta T Here, \\\\scriptstyle C_S is the coefficient of strain, which is related to the strain optic coefficient \\\\scriptstyle p_e. Also, \\\\scriptstyle C_T is the coefficient of temperature, which is made up of the thermal expansion coefficient of the optical fiber, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha_\\\\Lambda, and the thermo-optic coefficient, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha_n. Fiber Bragg gratings can then be used as direct sensing elements for strain and temperature. They can also be used as transduction elements, converting the output of another sensor, which generates a strain or temperature change from the measurand, for example fiber Bragg grating gas sensors use an absorbent coating, which in the presence of a gas expands generating a strain, which is measurable by the grating. Technically, the absorbent material is the sensing element, converting the amount of gas to a strain. The Bragg grating then transduces the strain to the change in wavelength. Specifically, fiber Bragg gratings are finding uses in instrumentation applications such as seismology, pressure sensors for extremely harsh environments, and as downhole sensors in oil and gas wells for measurement of the effects of external pressure, temperature, seismic vibrations and inline flow measurement. As such they offer a significant advantage over traditional electronic gauges used for these applications in that they are less sensitive to vibration or heat and consequently are far more reliable. In the 1990s, investigations were conducted for measuring strain and temperature in composite materials for aircraft and helicopter structures. =Fiber Bragg gratings used in fiber lasers= Recently the development of high power fiber lasers has generated a new set of applications for fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), operating at power levels that were previously thought impossible. In the case of a simple fiber laser, the FBGs can be used as the high reflector (HR) and output coupler (OC) to form the laser cavity. The gain for the laser is provided by a length of rare earth doped optical fiber, with the most common form using Yb3+ ions as the active lasing ion in the silica fiber. These Yb-doped fiber lasers first operated at the 1 kW CW power level in 2004 based on free space cavities but were not shown to operate with fiber Bragg grating cavities until much later. Such monolithic, all-fiber devices are produced by many companies worldwide and at power levels exceeding 1 kW. The major advantage of these all fiber systems, where the free space mirrors are replaced with a pair of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), is the elimination of realignment during the life of the system, since the FBG is spliced directly to the doped fiber and never needs adjusting. The challenge is to operate these monolithic cavities at the kW CW power level in large mode area (LMA) fibers such as 20/400 (20 μm diameter core and 400 μm diameter inner cladding) without premature failures at the intra-cavity splice points and the gratings. Once optimized, these monolithic cavities do not need realignment during the life of the device, removing any cleaning and degradation of fiber surface from the maintenance schedule of the laser. However, the packaging and optimization of the splices and FBGs themselves are non-trivial at these power levels as are the matching of the various fibers, since the composition of the Yb-doped fiber and various passive and photosensitive fibers needs to be carefully matched across the entire fiber laser chain. Although the power handling capability of the fiber itself far exceeds this level, and is possibly as high as >30 kW CW, the practical limit is much lower due to component reliability and splice losses. =Process of matching active and passive fibers= In a double-clad fiber there are two waveguides – the Yb-doped core that forms the signal waveguide and the inner cladding waveguide for the pump light. The inner cladding of the active fiber is often shaped to scramble the cladding modes and increase pump overlap with the doped core. The matching of active and passive fibers for improved signal integrity requires optimization of the core/clad concentricity, and the MFD through the core diameter and NA, which reduces splice loss. This is principally achieved by tightening all of the pertinent fiber specifications.Oulundsen, G., Farley, K. , Abramczyk, J. and Wei, K. \\"Fiber for fiber lasers: Matching active and passive fibers improves fiber laser performance\\", Laser Focus World, Vol 48 Jan 2012. http://www.nufern.com/library/item/id/391/ Matching fibers for improved pump coupling requires optimization of the clad diameter for both the passive and the active fiber. To maximize the amount of pump power coupled into the active fiber, the active fiber is designed with a slightly larger clad diameter than the passive fibers delivering the pump power. As an example, passive fibers with clad diameters of 395-μm spliced to active octagon shaped fiber with clad diameters of 400-μm improve the coupling of the pump power into the active fiber. An image of such a splice is shown, showing the shaped cladding of the doped double-clad fiber. The matching of active and passive fibers can be optimized in several ways. The easiest method for matching the signal carrying light is to have identical NA and core diameters for each fiber. This however does not account for all the refractive index profile features. Matching of the MFD is also a method used to create matched signal carrying fibers. It has been shown that matching all of these components provides the best set of fibers to build high power amplifiers and lasers. Essentially, the MFD is modeled and the resulting target NA and core diameter are developed. The core- rod is made and before being drawn into fiber its core diameter and NA are checked. Based on the refractive index measurements, the final core/clad ratio is determined and adjusted to the target MFD. This approach accounts for details of the refractive index profile which can be measured easily and with high accuracy on the preform, before it is drawn into fiber.

Rejuvenation is distinct from life extension. Life extension strategies often study the causes of aging and try to oppose those causes in order to slow aging. Rejuvenation is the reversal of aging and thus requires a different strategy, namely repair of the damage that is associated with aging or replacement of damaged tissue with new tissue. Rejuvenation can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve rejuvenation. Historical and cultural background Various myths tell the stories about the quest for rejuvenation. It was believed that magic or intervention of a supernatural power can bring back the youth and many mythical adventurers set out on a journey to do that, for themselves, their relatives or some authority that sent them anonymously. An ancient Chinese emperor actually sent out ships of young men and women to find a pearl that would rejuvenate him. This led to a myth among modern Chinese that Japan was founded by these people. In some religions, people were to be rejuvenated after death prior to placing them in heaven. The stories continued well into the 16th century. The Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León led an expedition around the Caribbean islands and into Florida to find the Fountain of Youth. Led by the rumors, the expedition continued the search and many perished. The Fountain was nowhere to be found as locals were unaware of its exact location. Since the emergence of philosophy, sages and self-proclaimed wizards always made enormous efforts to find the secret of youth, both for themselves and for their noble patrons and sponsors. It was widely believed that some potions may restore the youth. Another commonly cited approach was attempting to transfer the essence of youth from young people to old. Some examples of this approach were sleeping with virgins or children (sometimes literally sleeping, not necessarily having sex), bathing in or drinking their blood. The quest for rejuvenation reached its height with alchemy. All around Europe, and also beyond, alchemists were looking for the Philosopher's Stone, the mythical substance that, as it was believed, could not only turn lead into gold, but also prolong life and restore youth. Although the set goal was not achieved, alchemy paved the way to the scientific method and so to the medical advances of today. Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff was a French surgeon born in Russia who gained fame for his technique of grafting monkey testicle tissue on to the testicles of men while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s. This was one of the first medically accepted rejuvenation therapies (before he was proved to be wrong around 1930–1940). The technique brought him a great deal of money, although he was already independently wealthy. As his work fell out of favor, he went from being a highly respected surgeon to a subject of ridicule. By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in Algiers.Common, Laura. (April 25, 2000) The Medical Post Great balls of fire: from prehistory, men have tried implants and extracts from macho animals to cure impotence, but it was only relatively recently that they began to understand why they did so.

(December 11, 1986) The Times Christmas Books: Believe it or not - Adam and Eve to bent spoons / Review of books on beliefs. Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, who was one of the fathers of cellular therapy, developed in 1931–1949 years the so-called Fresh cell therapy. Fresh cell therapy is mainly the use of live animal embryo organs cells which are injected into the patient with the purpose of achieving a revitalizing effect. These cells are generally extracted from sheep’s fetuses because in comparison to other animals, like pigs, rabbits and cows, sheep are clean animals and rarely contract diseases. Of course animal cells are not able to be included in human tissue, but they can secrete factors for rejuvenating. That's why this rejuvenation technology, despite the harsh criticismChaisinthop, N. (2013). What is Fresh Cell Therapy? is practiced to this day. Rejuvenation technology and its effects on individuals and society have long been a subject of science fiction. The Misspent Youth and Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton are among the most well known examples of this, dealing with the short- and long- term effects of a near perfect 80-year-old to 20-year-old body change with mind intact. The less perfect rejuvenation featured in the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson results in long-term memory loss and sheer boredom that comes with extreme age. The post-mortal characters in the Revelation Space series have long-term or essentially infinite lifespans, and sheer boredom induces them to undertake activities of extreme risk. Modern developments Aging is an accumulation of damage to macromolecules, cells, tissues and organs. If any of that damage can be repaired, the result is rejuvenation. There have been many experiments which have been shown to increase the maximum life span of laboratory animals, thereby achieving life extension. A few experimental methods such as replacing hormones to youthful levels have had considerable success in partially rejuvenating laboratory animals and humans. A recent experiment involved breeding genetically manipulated mice that lacked an enzyme called telomerase, causing the mice to age prematurely and suffer ailments. When the mice were given injections to reactivate the enzyme, it repaired the damaged tissues and reversed the signs of aging. There are at least eight important hormones that decline with age: 1. human growth hormone (HGH); 2. the sexual hormones: testosterone or oestrogen/progesterone; 3. erythropoietin (EPO); 4. insulin; 5. DHEA; 6. melatonin; 7. thyroid; 8. pregnenolone. In theory, if all or some of these hormones are replaced, the body will respond to them as it did when it was younger, thus repairing and restoring many body functions. In line with this, recent experiments show that heterochronic parabiosis, i.e. connecting the circulatory systems of young and old animal, leads to the rejuvenation of the old animal, including restoration of proper stem cell function. Similar experiments show that grafting old muscles into young hosts leads to their complete restoration, whereas grafting young muscles into old hosts does not. These experiments show that aging is mediated by systemic environment, rather than being an intrinsic cell property. Clinical trials based on transfusion of young blood were scheduled to begin in 2014. Most attempts at genetic repair have traditionally involved the use of a retrovirus to insert a new gene into a random position on a chromosome. But by attaching zinc fingers (which determine where transcription factors bind) to endonucleases (which break DNA strands), homologous recombination can be induced to correct and replace defective (or undesired) DNA sequences. The first applications of this technology are to isolate stem cells from the bone marrow of patients having blood disease mutations, to correct those mutations in laboratory dishes using zinc finger endonucleases and to transplant the stem cells back into the patients. Stem cell regenerative medicine uses three different strategies: # Implantation of stem cells from culture into an existing tissue structure # Implantation of stem cells into a tissue scaffold that guides restoration # Induction of residual cells of a tissue structure to regenerate the necessary body part A salamander can not only regenerate a limb, but can regenerate the lens or retina of an eye and can regenerate an intestine. For regeneration the salamander tissues form a blastema by de-differentiation of mesenchymal cells, and the blastema functions as a self-organizing system to regenerate the limb. Yet another option involves cosmetic changes to the individual to create the appearance of youth. These are generally superficial and do little to make the person healthier or live longer, but the real improvement in a person's appearance may elevate their mood and have positive side effects normally correlated with happiness. Cosmetic surgery is a large industry offering treatments such as removal of wrinkles (\\"face lift\\"), removal of extra fat (liposuction) and reshaping or augmentation of various body parts (abdomen, breasts, face). There are also, as commonly found throughout history, many fake rejuvenation products that have been shown to be ineffective. Chief among these are powders, sprays, gels, and homeopathic substances that claim to contain growth hormones. Authentic growth hormones are only effective when injected, mainly due to the fact that the 191-amino acid protein is too large to be absorbed through the mucous membranes, and would be broken up in the stomach if swallowed. The Mprize scientific competition is under way to deliver on the mission of extending healthy human life. It directly accelerates the development of revolutionary new life extension therapies by awarding two cash prizes: one to the research team that breaks the world record for the oldest- ever mouse; and one to the team that develops the most successful late-onset rejuvenation. Current Mprize winner for rejuvenation is Steven Spindler. Caloric restriction (CR), the consumption of fewer calories while avoiding malnutrition, was applied as a robust method of decelerating aging and the development of age-related diseases. Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence  The biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey has initiated a project, Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), to study how to reverse the damage caused by aging. He has proposed seven strategies for what he calls the seven deadly sins of aging: # Cell loss can be repaired (reversed) just by suitable exercise in the case of muscle. For other tissues it needs various growth factors to stimulate cell division, or in some cases it needs stem cells. # Senescent cells can be removed by activating the immune system against them. Or they can be destroyed by gene therapy to introduce \\"suicide genes\\" that only kill senescent cells. # Protein cross-linking can largely be reversed by drugs that break the links. But to break some of the cross-links we may need to develop enzymatic methods. # Extracellular garbage (like amyloid) can be eliminated by vaccination that gets immune cells to \\"eat\\" the garbage. # For intracellular junk we need to introduce new enzymes, possibly enzymes from soil bacteria, that can degrade the junk (lipofuscin) that our own natural enzymes cannot degrade. # For mitochondrial mutations the plan is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the mitochondrial genes into the cell nucleus by gene therapy. The mitochondrial DNA experiences a high degree of mutagenic damage because most free radicals are generated in the mitochondria. A copy of the mitochondrial DNA located in the nucleus will be better protected from free radicals, and there will be better DNA repair when damage occurs. All mitochondrial proteins would then be imported into the mitochondria. # For cancer (the most lethal consequence of mutations) the strategy is to use gene therapy to delete the genes for telomerase and to eliminate telomerase- independent mechanisms of turning normal cells into \\"immortal\\" cancer cells. To compensate for the loss of telomerase in stem cells we would introduce new stem cells every decade or so. In 2009, Aubrey de Grey co-founded the SENS Foundation to expedite progress in the above-listed areas. Scientific journal * Rejuvenation Research Editor: Aubrey de Grey.

Life He was captured as a young man at the Battle of Poitiers, but ransomed. After the death of his father and elder brother following the Battle of Brignais, John succeeded them as Count of La Marche. He took an active part in the Hundred Years' War, and became Governor of Limousin after helping reconquer it from the English. Later he joined Bertrand du Guesclin in his campaign of 1366 in Castile. In 1374, his brother-in-law Bouchard VII, Count of Vendôme died, and John became Count of Vendôme and Castres in right of his wife. He joined the campaign of Charles VI 1382 in Flanders (which culminated in the Battle of Roosebeke) and fought in 1392 in Brittany. He rebuilt the castles of Vendôme and Lavardin. Marriage and children On 28 September 1364, he married Catherine of Vendôme, countess of Vendôme (d. 1412) and daughter of John VI, Count of Vendôme. He had seven children by Catherine: * James II, Count of La Marche and Castres (1370-1438). * Isabelle (b. 1373), a nun at Poissy. * Louis, Count of Vendôme (1376-1446). * John, Lord of Carency (1378-1457), married c. 1416 Catherine, daughter of Philip of Artois, Count of Eu, without issue, married in 1420 at Le Mans, his mistress Jeanne de Vendômois, with whom he had issue. * Anne (c. 1380 - September 1408, Paris), married in 1401 John of Berry, Count of Montpensier (d. 1401), married in Paris in 1402 Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria. * Marie (1386 - aft. 11 September 1463), Lady of Brehencourt, married Jean de Baynes, Lord of Croix. * Charlotte (1388 - 15 January 1422), married in 1411 at Nicosia King Janus of Cyprus. Ancestors =Patrilineal descent= John's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Count John were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house. John is a member of the House of Bourbon, a branch of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians. John's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Kings of France and the Counts of Paris and Worms. This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe. #Robert II of Worms and Rheingau (Robert of Hesbaye), 770 - 807 #Robert III of Worms and Rheingau, 808 - 834 #Robert IV the Strong, 820 - 866 #Robert I of France, 866 - 923 #Hugh the Great, 895 - 956 #Hugh Capet, 941 - 996 #Robert II of France, 972 - 1031 #Henry I of France, 1008–1060 #Philip I of France, 1053–1108 #Louis VI of France, 1081–1137 #Louis VII of France, 1120–1180 #Philip II of France, 1165–1223 #Louis VIII of France, 1187–1226 #Louis IX of France, 1215–1270 #Robert, Count of Clermont, 1256–1317 #Louis I, Duke of Bourbon, 1279–1342 #James I, Count of La Marche, 1319–1362 #John I de Bourbon, Count of La Marche, 1344–1393 Notes References Bourbon-La Marche, John I of Bourbon-La Marche, John I of House of Bourbon Bourbon-La Marche, John I of La Marche, John I of Bourbon, comte de Bourbon, John I of Counts of Castres 14th-century peers of France French prisoners of war in the Hundred Years' War ","title":"John I, Count of La Marche"},{"id":"2940880","text":"Amfibian is an American musical project led by Phish lyricist Tom Marshall. History Future members of the band appeared on Marshall's 2000 solo album Amfibian Tales, after which Marshall (on vocals and keyboards) officially formed Amfibian as a proper band. The group initially included guitarists Scott Metzger and Andrew Southern, bassist Matt Kohut (formerly of Ween), and drummers Pete Cottone and JP Wasicko. The group played a series of concerts in 2001, including a benefit for murdered Phish fan Kristin Laurite at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The show, hosted by Kevin Cassels of The Pharmer's Almanac, was to be released as a live album, but Marshall temporarily retired Amfibian at the end of the year. Three years later in 2004, Marshall reformed a completely new Amfibian with guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist Chris Metaxas, drummer Joe Larsen, bassist Bob Kay as well as guitarist Anthony Krizan, and released the band's first studio album, From the Ether, in the spring. The band went their separate ways after eight months of touring the U.S. east coast. In the fall of 2006, Marshall and Anthony Krizan returned with three new members for Skip The Goodbyes, released on Relix Records in June 2007. The album features Phish leader Trey Anastasio, as well as contributions from former Amfibian members Chris Metaxas, Benjamin Clapp, Mark Varga, and Thorp Rivingston. Tragically, the son of keyboardist John Korba died in a car accident in November 2007. This and other circumstances have caused Amfibian to take hiatus of indefinite length. Tom Marshall spent much of Spring (2008) in collaborative writing sessions with longtime friend and partner Trey Anastasio at Anastasio's studio in upstate New York, partially in preparation for Phish's Summer 2009 album release.

As such, it may be an important initiator of lipid peroxidation. =Importance for atmospheric chemistry= Gaseous hydroperoxyl is involved in reaction cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. It is also present in the troposphere, where it is essentially a byproduct of the oxidation of carbon monoxide and of hydrocarbons by the hydroxyl radical. Because dielectric constant has a strong effect on pKa, and the dielectric constant of air is quite low, superoxide produced (photochemically) in the atmosphere is almost exclusively present as HO2. As HO2 is quite reactive, it acts as a \\"cleanser\\" of the atmosphere by degrading certain organic pollutants. As such, the chemistry of HO2 is of considerable geochemical importance.

He was released from prison after serving 9 years of a 10-year prison term for the rape and assault of a teenager. Controversies =Conviction for sexual assault charges = On 14 October 2005, Kamm was sentenced to five years in prison with a non-parole period of three-and-a-half years for a string of sexual attacks including aggravated sexual assault on a 15-year-old girl. He claimed that she was one of his 84 mystical wives.Religious Leader Charged with Sexual Assault, abc.net.au. The assaults occurred when the girl was living within Kamm's Order of St Charbel, a community (living in a compound) near Nowra, New South Wales. Kamm claimed to have received advice from the Virgin Mary that the girl should be chosen as one of 12 queens and 72 princesses who would all become his wives, with whom he would spawn a new human race after the world was cleansed and burnt by a ball of fire. Kamm's letters and diary entries to the 15-year-old girl, which were made public during the court session, display an explicit sexual style and were major evidence in his prosecution. Kamm was also found guilty in May 2007 of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault in relation to another 15-year-old girl. In August 2007, after losing an appeal on his original sentence, Kamm was re-sentenced to a total of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years. He was due to become eligible for release on parole on 13 April 2013, but was refused. In November 2014 parole was granted. =Papal aspirations and prophecies= Kamm was also noted for a series of unusual reputed prophecies which were never fulfilled (including the start of World War III). Kamm claimed that Pope John Paul II, who remains widely venerated throughout Kamm's movement, would consecrate Kamm a bishop and appoint him as his official and sole successor to the papacy. When this prophecy was unfulfilled on Pope John Paul's death in 2005, Kamm quickly issued a press statement, saying \\"heaven clearly changed its plans\\" and declaring, that they would accept Pope Benedict XVI as legitimate Roman Pontiff. They claim prophecies have changed and stated that Kamm is to be the successor to Benedict XVI, instead of to John Paul II as previously claimed. One of Kamm's claims is that Pope John Paul II will rise from the dead and reappear on the surface of the world again to fight evil along with Benedict XVI and possibly to appoint Kamm.Snow, R; Deadly cults: the crimes of true believers, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p110 Personal life and release from prison Kamm was married to Bettina Kamm.

During the process, atoms of carbon and nitrogen diffuse interstitially into the metal, creating barriers to slip, increasing the hardness and modulus near the surface. Carbonitriding is often applied to inexpensive, easily machined low carbon steel to impart the surface properties of more expensive and difficult to work grades of steel.Carbonitriding Surface hardness of carbonitrided parts ranges from 55 to 62 HRC. Certain pre-industrial case hardening processes include not only carbon-rich materials such as charcoal, but nitrogen-rich materials such as urea, which implies that traditional surface hardening techniques were a form of carbonitriding. Process Carbonitriding is similar to gas carburization with the addition of ammonia to the carburizing atmosphere, which provides a source of nitrogen. Nitrogen is absorbed at the surface and diffuses into the workpiece along with carbon. Carbonitriding (around 850 °C / 1550 °F) is carried out at temperatures substantially higher than plain nitriding (around 530 °C / 990 °F) but slightly lower than those used for carburizing (around 950 °C / 1700 °F) and for shorter times. Carbonitriding tends to be more economical than carburizing, and also reduces distortion during quenching. The lower temperature allows oil quenching, or even gas quenching with a protective atmosphere. Characteristics of carbonitrided parts Carbonitriding forms a hard, wear-resistant case, is typically 0.07 mm to 0.5 mm thick, and generally has higher hardness than a carburized case. Case depth is tailored to the application; a thicker case increases the wear life of the part. Carbonitriding alters only the top layers of the workpiece; and does not deposit an additional layer, so the process does not significantly alter the dimensions of the part. Maximum case depth is typically restricted to 0.75 mm; case depths greater than this take too long to diffuse to be economical. Shorter processing times are preferred to restrict the concentration of nitrogen in the case, as nitrogen addition is more difficult to control than carbon. An excess of nitrogen in the work piece can cause high levels of retained austenite and porosity, which are undesirable in producing a part of high hardness. Advantages Carbonitriding also has other advantages over carburizing. To begin, it has a greater resistance to softening during tempering and increased fatigue and impact strength. It is possible to use both carbonitriding and carburizing together to form optimum conditions of deeper case depths and therefore performance of the part in industry. This method is applied particularly to steels with low case hardenability, such as the seat of the valve. The process applied is initially carburizing to the required case depth (up to 2.5 mm) at around 900-955°C, and then carbonitriding to achieve required carbonitrided case depth. The parts are then oil quenched, and the resulting part has a harder case than possibly achieved for carburization, and the addition of the carbonitrided layer increases the residual compressive stresses in the case such that the contact fatigue resistance and strength gradient are both increased. Studies are showing that carbonitriding improves corrosion resistance.Yazıcı, A., Zeybek, M.S., Güler, H., Koç, M., Pekitkan, F. G., 2017 Effect of Carbonitriding on Corrosion Resistance of Steel 30MnB5 in Two Acidic Environments. Metal Science and Heat Treatment, 59 (3-4), 190-193 (Doi: 10.1007/s11041-017-0127-8). Applications Typical applications for case hardening are gear teeth, cams, shafts, bearings, fasteners, pins, hydraulic piston rods, automotive clutch plates, tools, dies and tillage tools.

At the time, he was the youngest college graduate in U.S. history (a record since broken by Michael Kearney). Biography Adragon's father, Agustin Eastwood De Mello (1929–2003), had set the goal that his son would become a Nobel Prize laureate by age 16. The elder De Mello was a karate master, flamenco guitarist,http://www.lifeinlegacy.com/2003/WIR20030607.html#D06 and former weightlifting champion, and he vigorously mentored Adragon from an early age. In 1981, Adragon was accepted into Mensa. After attending a series of schools for gifted children, Adragon attended Cabrillo College for two years starting in 1984. In 1987, while at university, Adragon and his father were interviewed by Morley Safer on 60 Minutes II. They also appeared on 48 Hours (TV series) and The Tonight Show. While he did graduate from university in 1988, some of his math teachers later claimed that his grades were borderline. Adragon was accepted into a graduate program at the Florida Institute of Technology. In July 1988, his parents separated and, after a brief period in foster care, he returned to the custody of his mother, Cathy Gunn. Although a college graduate, he opted to enroll in Sunnyvale Junior High School (now Sunnyvale Middle School) under the assumed name of James Gunn. He found it \\"nice because no one knew who [he] was\\" and was \\"upset\\" when local papers identified him after his graduation. In 1994, he graduated from Homestead High School. In 2000, he was training to be an estimator for a commercial painting company. On March 15, 2001, the elder De Mello, allegedly called 4-1-1 asking for the phone number of the police and mentioning that he was dying of cancer. This led to an armed standoff with Santa Cruz police. He was subsequently charged with assault with a deadly weapon. De Mello, suffering from bladder cancer, was released to the custody of his son. Agustin de Mello died on May 30, 2003. As of 2003, De Mello was working for The Home Depot. As of 2016, Adragon is married and has a young daughter. Adragon has three half brothers fathered by Agustin - Brad Farha (b. 1962), Andre Jappen (b. 1963, d. 2015) and Pete Jappen (b. 1964).

Realism is one of the dominant schools of thought in international relations theory, theoretically formalising the Realpolitik statesmanship of early modern Europe. Although a highly diverse body of thought, it is unified by the belief that world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors pursuing power. The theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism. Realists can be divided into three classes based on their view of the essential causes of interstate conflict. Classical realists believe it follows from human nature; neorealists attribute it to the dynamics of the anarchic state system; neoclassical realists believe it results from both, in combination with domestic politics. Neorealists are also divided between defensive and offensive realism. Realists trace the history of their ideas back through classical antiquity, beginning with Thucydides. Jonathan Haslam characterizes realism as \\"a spectrum of ideas.\\" Its theories revolve around four central propositions: # states are the central actors in international politics, rather than leaders or international organizations; # the international political system is anarchic, as there is no supranational authority to enforce rules; # states act in their rational self-interest within the international system; and # states desire power to ensure self-preservation. Realism is often associated with realpolitik, as both deal with the pursuit, possession, and application of power. Realpolitik, however, is an older prescriptive guideline limited to policy-making, while realism is a wider theoretical and methodological paradigm to describe, explain, and predict events in international relations. As an academic pursuit, realism is not tied to ideology; it does not favor any particular moral philosophy, nor does it consider ideology to be a major factor in the behavior of nations. Priorities of realists have been described as Machiavellian, single-mindedly seeking the power of one's own nation over others.  Common assumptions  The four propositions of realism are as follows.Jack Donnelly, \\"The Ethics of Realism\\", in Christian Reus-Smit, Duncan Snidal (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Relations, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 150. # States are the most important actors. # The international system is anarchic. #* No actor exists above states, capable of regulating their interactions; states must arrive at relations with other states on their own, rather than it being dictated to them by some higher controlling entity. #* The international system exists in a state of constant antagonism (anarchy). # All states within the system are unitary, rational actors #* States tend to pursue self-interest. #* Groups strive to attain as many resources as possible (relative gain). # The primary concern of all states is survival. #* States build up their militaries to survive, which may lead to a security dilemma. Realists think that mankind is not inherently benevolent but rather self-centered and competitive. This perspective, which is shared by theorists such as Thomas Hobbes, views human nature as egocentric (not necessarily selfish) and conflictual unless there exist conditions under which humans may coexist. It is also disposed of the notion that an individual's intuitive nature is made up of anarchy. In regards to self- interest, these individuals are self-reliant and are motivated in seeking more power. They are also believed to be fearful. This view contrasts with the approach of liberalism to international relations. The state emphasises an interest in accumulating power to ensure security in an anarchic world. Power is a concept primarily thought of in terms of material resources necessary to induce harm or coerce other states (to fight and win wars). The use of power places an emphasis on coercive tactics being acceptable to either accomplish something in the national interest or avoid something inimical to the national interest. The state is the most important actor under realism. It is unitary and autonomous because it speaks and acts with one voice. The power of the state is understood in terms of its military capabilities. A key concept under realism is the international distribution of power referred to as system polarity. Polarity refers to the number of blocs of states that exert power in an international system. A multipolar system is composed of three or more blocs, a bipolar system is composed of two blocs, and a unipolar system is dominated by a single power or hegemon. Under unipolarity realism predicts that states will band together to oppose the hegemon and restore a balance of power. Although all states seek hegemony under realism as the only way to ensure their own security, other states in the system are incentivised to prevent the emergence of a hegemon through balancing. States employ the rational model of decision making by obtaining and acting upon complete and accurate information. The state is sovereign and guided by a national interest defined in terms of power. Since the only constraint of the international system is anarchy, there is no international authority and states are left to their own devices to ensure their own security. Realists believe that sovereign states are the principal actors in the international system. International institutions, non-governmental organizations, multinational corporations, individuals and other sub-state or trans-state actors are viewed as having little independent influence. States are inherently aggressive (offensive realism) and obsessed with security (defensive realism). Territorial expansion is only constrained by opposing powers. This aggressive build-up, however, leads to a security dilemma whereby increasing one's security may bring along even greater instability as an opposing power builds up its own arms in response (an arms race). Thus, security becomes a zero-sum game where only relative gains can be made. Realists believe that there are no universal principles with which all states may guide their actions. Instead, a state must always be aware of the actions of the states around it and must use a pragmatic approach to resolve problems as they arise. Realism in statecraft ;Modern realist statesmen * Charles de Gaulle * Henry Kissinger * Zbigniew Brzezinski * Brent Scowcroft * Vladimir Putin The ideas behind George F. Kennan's work as a diplomat and diplomatic historian remain relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. In the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power and the reliance on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft is considered impractical. According to the Wilsonian approach, on the other hand, the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is key and morals are universally valid. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy reflected the Wilsonian school to such a degree that those in favor of the realist approach likened Clinton's policies to social work. Some argue that in Kennan's view of American Diplomacy, based on the realist approach, such apparent moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self-defeating and may lead to the erosion of power, to America's detriment. Others argue that Kennan, a proponent of the Marshall Plan (which gave out bountiful American aid to post-WW2 countries), might agree that Clinton's aid functioned strategically to secure international leverage: a diplomatic maneuver well within the bounds of political realism as described by Hedley Bull. Realists often hold that statesmen tend towards realism whereas realism is deeply unpopular among the public. When statesmen take actions that divert from realist policies, academic realists often argue that this is due to distortions that stem from domestic politics. However, some research suggests that realist policies are actually popular among the public whereas elites are more beholden to liberal ideas. Historical branches and antecedents Historian Jean Bethke Elshtain traces the historiography of realism: :The genealogy of realism as international relations, although acknowledging antecedents, gets down to serious business with Machiavelli, moving on to theorists of sovereignty and apologists for the national interest. It is present in its early modern forms with Hobbes's Leviathan (1651). While realism as a formal discipline in international relations did not arrive until World War II, its primary assumptions have been expressed in earlier writings:Political Realism, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophysee also Doyle, Michael.Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism (Paperback). 1997. London: W. W. Norton & Company, esp. pp. 41–204; Modern realism began as a serious field of research in the United States during and after World War II. This evolution was partly fueled by European war migrants like Hans Morgenthau, whose work Politics Among Nations is considered a seminal development in the rise of modern realism. * George F. Kennan – containment * Nicholas Spykman – geostrategy, containment * Herman Kahn – nuclear strategy * E. H. CarrE. H. Carr, The Twenty Years' Crisis 1919-1989: An Introduction to the Study of International Relations (London, 1939) – political economy =Classical realism= Classical realism states that it is fundamentally the nature of humans that pushes states and individuals to act in a way that places interests over ideologies. Classical realism is an ideology defined as the view that the \\"drive for power and the will to dominate [that are] held to be fundamental aspects of human nature\\".Baylis, J & Smith, S & Owens, P, The Globalization of World Politics, Oxford University Press, US, p. 95. Prominent classical realists: * Hans Morgenthau * Reinhold Niebuhr – Christian realism * Raymond Aron * George Kennan * Yan Xuetong – Realism and Chinese foreign policy =Liberal realism or the English school or rationalism= The English school holds that the international system, while anarchical in structure, forms a \\"society of states\\" where common norms and interests allow for more order and stability than that which may be expected in a strict realist view. Prominent English School writer Hedley Bull's 1977 classic, The Anarchical Society, is a key statement of this position. Prominent liberal realists: * Hedley Bull – argued for both the existence of an international society of states and its perseverance even in times of great systemic upheaval, meaning regional or so-called \\"world wars\\" * Martin Wight * Barry Buzan =Neorealism or structural realism= Neorealism derives from classical realism except that instead of human nature, its focus is predominantly on the anarchic structure of the international system. States are primary actors because there is no political monopoly on force existing above any sovereign. While states remain the principal actors, greater attention is given to the forces above and below the states through levels of analysis or structure and agency debate. The international system is seen as a structure acting on the state with individuals below the level of the state acting as agency on the state as a whole. While neorealism shares a focus on the international system with the English school, neorealism differs in the emphasis it places on the permanence of conflict. To ensure state security, states must be on constant preparation for conflict through economic and military build-up. Prominent neorealists: * Robert J. Art – neorealism * Robert Gilpin – hegemonic theory * Robert Jervis – defensive realism * Christopher Layne - neorealism * John Mearsheimer – offensive realism * Barry Posen - neorealism * Kenneth Waltz – defensive realism * Stephen Walt – defensive realism =Neoclassical realism= Neoclassical realism can be seen as the third generation of realism, coming after the classical authors of the first wave (Thucydides, Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes) and the neorealists (especially Kenneth Waltz). Its designation of \\"neoclassical\\", then, has a double meaning: # It offers the classics a renaissance; # It is a synthesis of the neorealist and the classical realist approaches. Gideon Rose is responsible for coining the term in a book review he wrote. The primary motivation underlying the development of neoclassical realism was the fact that neorealism was only useful to explain political outcomes (classified as being theories of international politics), but had nothing to offer about particular states' behavior (or theories of foreign policy). The basic approach, then, was for these authors to \\"refine, not refute, Kenneth Waltz\\", by adding domestic intervening variables between systemic incentives and a state's foreign policy decision. Thus, the basic theoretical architecture of neoclassical realism is: : Distribution of power in the international system (independent variable) : Domestic perception of the system and domestic incentives (intervening variable) : Foreign policy decision (dependent variable) While neoclassical realism has only been used for theories of foreign policy so far, Randall Schweller notes that it could be useful to explain certain types of political outcomes as well.Randall L. Schweller, \\"The Progressiveness of Neoclassical Realism\\", pp. 311–347 in Colin Elman and Miriam Fendius Elman eds., Progress in International Relations Theory, (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2003). Neoclassical realism is particularly appealing from a research standpoint because it still retains a lot of the theoretical rigor that Waltz has brought to realism, but at the same time can easily incorporate a content-rich analysis, since its main method for testing theories is the process-tracing of case studies. Prominent neoclassical realists: * Aaron Friedberg * Randall Schweller * William Wohlforth * Fareed Zakaria =Left realism= Several scholars, including Mark Laffey at the School of Oriental and African Studies, and Ronald Osborn at the University of Southern California, have argued for the idea of a \\"Left Realism\\" in IR theory with particular reference to the work of Noam Chomsky. Both Laffey and Osborn have suggested in separate articles in Review of International Studies that Chomsky's understanding of power in the international sphere reflects the analytical assumptions of classical realism combined with a radical moral, normative or \\"Left\\" critique of the state. =Realist constructivism= Some see a complementarity between realism and constructivism. Samuel Barkin, for instance, holds that \\"realist constructivism\\" can fruitfully \\"study the relationship between normative structures, the carriers of political morality, and uses of power\\" in ways that existing approaches do not. Similarly, Jennifer Sterling-Folker has argued that theoretical synthesis helps explanations of international monetary policy by combining realism's emphasis of an anarchic system with constructivism's insights regarding important factors from the domestic level.Jennifer Sterling-Folker, Theories of International Cooperation and the Primacy of Anarchy: Explaining U.S. International Monetary Policy-Making after Bretton Wood, State University of New York Press, 2002. Scholars such as Oded Löwenheim and Ned Lebow have also been associated with realist constructivism. Criticisms =Democratic peace= Democratic peace theory advocates also that realism is not applicable to democratic states' relations with each another as their studies claim that such states do not go to war with one another. However, realists and proponents of other schools have critiqued both this claim and the studies which appear to support it, claiming that its definitions of \\"war\\" and \\"democracy\\" must be tweaked in order to achieve the desired result. =Hegemonic peace= Robert Gilpin developed the theory of hegemonic stability theory within the realist framework, but limited it to the economic field. Niall Ferguson remarked that the theory has offered insights into the way that economic power works, but neglected the military and cultural aspects of power.“Hegemony or Empire?” Foreign Affairs, 82/5, (2003): p 161. =Federalism= The term refers to the theory or advocacy of federal political orders, where final authority is divided between sub-units and a centre. Unlike a unitary state, sovereignty is constitutionally split between at least two territorial levels so that units at each level have final authority and can act independently of the others in some area. Citizens thus have political obligations to two authorities. The allocation of authority between the sub-unit and centre may vary. Typically the centre has powers regarding defence and foreign policy, but sub-units may also have international roles. The sub-units may also participate in central decision- making bodies. The basic idea behind federalism is that a unifying relationship between states should be established under a common system of law. Conflict and disagreement should be resolved through peaceful means rather than through coercion or war. Its most important aspect is in recognizing that different types of institutions are needed to deal with different types of political issues. =Post-realism= Post-realism suggests that realism is a form of social, scientific and political rhetoric. It opens rather than closes a debate about what is real and what is realistic in international relations. Prominent post-realists: * Francis A. Beer * James Der Derian * Robert Hariman * Michael J. Shapiro = Inconsistent with non- European politics = Scholars have argued that realist theories, in particular realist conceptions of anarchy and balances of power, have not characterized the international systems of East Asia and Africa (before, during and after colonization).

Prose of the Republic of Turkey covers the \\"Turkish Prose\\" beginning with 1911 with the national literature movement. Stylistically, the prose of the early years of the Republic of Turkey was essentially a continuation of the National Literature movement, with Realism and Naturalism predominating. This trend culminated in the 1932 novel Yaban (\\"The Strange\\"), by Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu. This novel can be seen as the precursor to two trends that would soon develop: social realism, and the \\"village novel\\" (köy romanı).Bezirci, 105–108 Çalıkuşu (\\"The Wren\\") by Reşat Nuri Güntekin addresses a similar theme with the works of Karaosmanoğlu. Güntekin's narrative has a detailed and precise style, with a realistic tone. The social realist movement is perhaps best represented by the short-story writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık (1906–1954), whose work sensitively and realistically treats the lives of cosmopolitan Istanbul's lower classes and ethnic minorities, subjects which led to some criticism in the contemporary nationalistic atmosphere.Paskin 2005 The tradition of the \\"village novel\\", on the other hand, arose somewhat later. As its name suggests, the \\"village novel\\" deals, in a generally realistic manner, with life in the villages and small towns of Turkey. The major writers in this tradition are Kemal Tahir (1910–1973), Orhan Kemal (1914–1970), and Yaşar Kemal (1923– ). Yaşar Kemal, in particular, has earned fame outside of Turkey not only for his novels; many of which, such as 1955's İnce Memed (\\"Memed, My Hawk\\"), elevate local tales to the level of epic; but also for his firmly leftist political stance. In a very different tradition, but evincing a similar strong political viewpoint, was the satirical short-story writer Aziz Nesin (1915–1995) and Rıfat Ilgaz (1911–1993). Another novelist contemporary to, but outside of, the social realist and \\"village novel\\" traditions is Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar (1901–1962). In addition to being an important essayist and poet, Tanpınar wrote a number of novels; such as Huzur (\\"Tranquillity\\", 1949) and Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü (\\"The Time Regulation Institute\\", 1961); which dramatize the clash between East and West in modern Turkish culture and society. Similar problems are explored by the novelist and short-story writer Oğuz Atay (1934–1977). Unlike Tanpınar, however, Atay—in such works as his long novel Tutunamayanlar (\\"The Disconnected\\", 1971–1972) and his short story \\"Beyaz Mantolu Adam\\" (\\"Man in a White Coat\\", 1975)—wrote in a more modernist and existentialist vein. On the other hand, Onat Kutlar's İshak (\\"Isaac\\", 1959), composed of nine short stories which are written mainly from a child's point of view and are often surrealistic and mystical, represent a very early example of magic realism. The tradition of literary modernism also informs the work of novelist Adalet Ağaoğlu (1929– ). Her trilogy of novels collectively entitled Dar Zamanlar (\\"Tight Times\\", 1973–1987), for instance, examines the changes that occurred in Turkish society between the 1930s and the 1980s in a formally and technically innovative style. Orhan Pamuk (1952– ), winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, is another such innovative novelist, though his works—such as 1990's Beyaz Kale (\\"The White Castle\\") and Kara Kitap (\\"The Black Book\\") and 1998's Benim Adım Kırmızı (\\"My Name is Red\\")—are influenced more by postmodernism than by modernism. This is true also of Latife Tekin (1957– ), whose first novel Sevgili Arsız Ölüm (\\"Dear Shameless Death\\", 1983) shows the influence not only of postmodernism, but also of magic realism.

She was crowned on 28 January 1479 in Tudela. Life Coat of arms of Queen Eleanor She was born in Olite, Navarre (now Spain), the third and youngest child of King John II of Aragon and Queen Blanche I of Navarre. She was the younger sister of Blanche II of Navarre. She was born 2 February 1426, and was acclaimed by the Cortes in Pamplona, 9 August 1427, as the legitimate heir of Charles of Viana (Charles \\"IV\\") and Blanche II of Navarre in succession to their mother. After their mother's death, however, their father occupied Navarre. She married Gaston IV, Count of Foix, in 1441. In 1442, Eleanor moved with her spouse to Bearn. In 1455, her father deposed her brother and her sister as heirs of Navarre and proclaimed Eleanor as the heir and the regent and general governor of Navarre. In her new capacities, she moved to Sangüesa. She continued as regent after the death of her brother in 1461. In 1462, she signed the Treaty of Olite, in which she recognized her father as the monarch of Navarre and accepted to have her sister Blanche imprisoned under her care. In 1464, Blanche died in her care, suspected to have been poisoned. By the treaty, she was recognized by her father as the heir of Navarre and his regent (governor) in Navarre. In 1468, her father killed her advisor Nicolas de Etchabarri, and deposed her as governor. In 1471, however, her father recognized her as the governor of Navarre until his death. At her father's death in 1479, she gave her oath as the monarch of Navarre and died two weeks later at Tudela, Navarre, aged 53. Marriage and children In 1441, she married Gaston IV, Count of Foix, and had the following children with him: *Marie (1443–1467), who married William VIII, Marquess of Montferrat; their daughter Blanche of Montferrat was the wife of Charles I, Duke of Savoy. *Gaston (1445–1470), who married Magdalena of France in 1462; their children Francis and Catherine both succeeded to Navarre in turn upon the death of their grandmother Eleanor. *Pierre (1449–1490), cardinal and bishop of Arles. *John (1450–1500), Viscount of Narbonne, whose daughter Germaine of Foix was the second wife of Ferdinand II of Aragon. *Joan (1454–1476), who married John V, count of Armagnac. *Eleanor (1457–1480), engaged firstly with Charles, duke de Guyenne (who died in 1472), and secondly with the duke of Medinacelli, but died before the wedding. *Margaret (1458–1487), who married Francis II, Duke of Brittany; their daughter Anne of Brittany was the wife of Charles VIII of France and later the second wife of Louis XII of France. *Catherine (1460–1494), who married Gaston II de Foix, Count of Candale and Benauges; their daughter Anne of Foix-Candale was the third wife of Vladislaus II of Hungary. *Isabella (1462–?), who married Guy de Pons, viscount of Turenne. *Anne (born and died 1464). *Jacques (1463–1508), count of Cortes, who married Catherine of Beaumont.

The estate was home to Frederic Edwin Church (1826–1900), one of the major figures in the Hudson River School of landscape painting. The centerpiece of Olana is an eclectic villa which overlooks parkland and a working farm designed by the artist. The residence has a wide view of the Hudson River Valley, the Catskill Mountains and the Taconic Range. Church and his wife Isabel (1836–1899) named their estate after a fortress-treasure house in ancient Greater Persia (modern-day Armenia), which also overlooked a river valley.

The interior remains much as it was during Church's lifetime, exotically furnished and decorated with objects from his global travels, and with some 40 paintings by Church and his friends. The house is intricately stenciled inside and out; Church designed the stencils based on his travels in the Middle East. The house contains Church's last studio, built as an addition from 1888 to 1890. History Clouds over Olana, by Frederic Edwin Church, 1872 In 1845, Frederic Church first sketched on the property that was to become Olana.Ryan, 2001 He was then a student of Thomas Cole, now considered a founding figure of the Hudson River School of painters. On March 31, 1860, a few months before his marriage to Isabel Carnes, Church returned to purchase a hardscrabble farm on a south-facing slope of a hill in Columbia County, near the thriving towns of Hudson and Catskill, New York. The first element he added to the property was a small country cottage, believed to have been designed by Richard Morris Hunt. In addition, Church laid out gardens and orchards, dredged a marsh to create a lake, planted trees, and built a studio. Frederic and Isabel Church called their house \\"Cosy Cottage\\" and their property \\"the Farm\\". Two children were born to the Churches, a son in 1862 and a daughter in 1865. The family's bucolic life at Olana was forever changed in March, 1865, with the deaths of the children from diphtheria.Howat, 2005, p. 123 Grieving from this, the greatest emotional blow of their lives, the parents traveled with sympathetic friends to Jamaica for four months, then to a retreat in Vermont. Late in 1865, the couple returned to Cosy Cottage to start anew.Howat, 2005, p. 128 Frederic Joseph Church was born in autumn 1866, the first of three sons and a daughter that were raised to adulthood at Olana. In 1867 Church acquired a parcel of mature woods at the top of his hill, and began planning a large house for the site. After an 18-month trip to Europe and the Middle East, Church hired architect Calvert Vaux and worked with him on the design of the mansion, which was constructed between 1870 and 1872. The Churches hosted notable figures from the literary, religious, artistic and business worlds: writer Charles Dudley Warner and his pianist wife Susan, author and artist Susan Hale, sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer and his wife Mary Jane, industrialist William H. Osborn and his wife Virginia, and humorist Mark Twain. For Christmas in 1879, Isabel Church gave her husband several books on the geography of the ancient Middle East, and shortly thereafter the couple began calling their property \\"Olana\\".Werner, 2005 Church continuously improved the property, plotting scenic carriage roads and adding a studio wing to the house over the period 1888–1891. Although the Churches often wintered in warmer climates, and spent time in New York City, Olana was their main residence. After Isabel Church's death in 1899 and Frederic Church's death in 1900, the property was inherited by their son Louis Church, who married Sarah Baker Good (known as Sally) in 1901. Louis and Sally Church maintained the property largely as it had been left to them, adding additional acreage for farming. Upon Sally Church's death in 1964, a nephew inherited the estate and intended to sell it to developers at a public auction. After a two-year anti- development campaign led by scholar David C. Huntington (1922–1990), which culminated in a cover story on Olana in Life magazine, New York State purchased the property in 1966 and it was opened to the public. Landscape Part of Olana's landscape and viewshed Over the last forty years of his life, Frederic Church created a designed landscape at Olana. In an 1884 letter, Church wrote of his work on the grounds at Olana, \\"I can make more and better landscapes in this way than by tampering with canvas and paint in the studio.\\"Church, letter to Erasmus Dow Palmer, 1884. Today Olana is known as one of the most important surviving Picturesque landscapes in the United States. Produced during the same period with the same aesthetic and ideological motivations, the landscape at Olana has been compared to Central Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Church began the physical landscape design at Olana by searching three years for the ideal property.Howat, 2005, p. 98 He had walked and sketched throughout much of New England and elsewhere by that time, but his formative two years studying with Thomas Cole in nearby Catskill, New York, brought him back to the Hudson Valley. The Church estate covers a series of small knolls rising up to the Sienghenbergh – Dutch for \\"Long Hill\\" – where the main house is sited. From various points around the property, one has views of the Hudson River, the Catskill, Taconic and Berkshire Mountain ranges, as well as New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. In 1860, Frederic Church made his initial acquisition of a 126-acre (50.99 ha) farm, which he developed into a ferme ornée, an ornamental farm.[6] Around Cosy Cottage, a profitable 15.5 acre (6.3 ha) orchard and 4.3 acres (1.7 ha) of vegetable and fruit gardens were created in addition to pastures and crop land, each with a distinct visual character. The family always called their place \\"the farm,\\" but when he bought the land, Church took about half out of active agricultural production to create a landscaped park.Toole, 1996 In this park, Church planted thousands of native trees (many transplanted from elsewhere on site); created a lake from a swamp; built a freestanding studio, summer house, and rustic benches and railings; and designed five miles (8.05 km) of carriage drives paved in crushed red shale mined on site. Church strategically acquired additional adjacent parcels until his property encompassed 250.2 acres (101.3 ha) and the top of the hill where the main house at Olana now stands. To conceal, reveal and frame vistas of his own property and the wider Hudson Valley, Church combined natural landforms with the careful layout of carriage drives and extensive plantings of trees and shrubs, .Toole, 1996, pp. 63-64 Frederick Law Olmsted thought of such landscapes as \\"pictures\\" through which people might wander.Trebilcock & Balint, 2009, p. 73 In addition to entertaining often, the Churches opened the Olana grounds to the public. From the popular carriage drives, visitors experienced the artist's landscape vignettes almost as cinema, in a sequence choreographed by Church. The ultimate aspect of Church's designed landscape is the view from the main house. There, the ground drops away sharply, the Hudson widens to two miles (3 km) across, and the Catskills rise up steeply. Like Church's painted views of Niagara Falls, Canadian icebergs, and South American volcanoes this scene captures the majesty of nature. For the artist and his contemporaries, this vista also captured the essence of their new nation with references to pioneering history, present economic strength, and the distinguished literary and artistic legacies of the region's Knickerbocker Group and Hudson River School.Gerald L. Carr, 2000 Main residence The south facade of the main house View of the Piazza and Studio Tower The stone, brick, and polychrome-stenciled villa at Olana is an unusual mixture of Victorian structural elements and Middle-Eastern decorative motifs from different times and places. Moorish elements mix with contrasting Italianate themes. Frederic and Isabel Church were impressed by the architecture they had seen on their travels in Beirut, Jerusalem and Damascus in 1868. Upon their return to their farm, they abandoned preliminary plans from Richard Morris Hunt delineating a manor house in the French style. Instead, Church worked closely with architect Calvert Vaux to realize a more personal vision. Church was responsible for the overall design and much of the detail, with Vaux's involvement essentially that of consultant. Church wrote to a friend, \\"I am building a house and am principally my own Architect. I give directions all day and draw plans and working drawings all night.\\" The result was a villa with asymmetrical massing of towers and block masonry punctuated by fanciful windows and porches. The irregular silhouette of the exterior contrasted with the more regular rhythm of rooms arranged around a central hall. On the exterior, Middle Eastern motifs were carried out in colored brick, slate, ceramic tile and especially stenciling. The cornices of the separate sections of the structure were each ornamented with multi-colored and gilt stenciling, the patterns designed by Church himself. The stenciling continued in the principle rooms of the first floor. Together, the various motifs and themes create a unique artistic unity, one that is difficult to categorize. It has been called variously Persian-Moorish-Eclectic, and Italianate-Eastern-Picturesque. Poet John Ashbery described the results: \\"The ensemble is breathtaking, and despite the proliferation of architectural elements and polychrome tile decoration, it is not busy but solemn and wildly fanciful, like Church's painting.\\"Ashbery, 2005, p. 264. Retrieved on April 8, 2010 Church designed or commissioned many other ingenious devices, such as amber glass windows overlaid by cut-paper patterns and carved teak woodwork by Lockwood de Forest's workshops in Ahmadabad, India. With no architectural adviser, Church designed and built the studio wing at the west end of the house, which included guest rooms and a glassed-in observation room in the tower. Describing his house to a newspaper reporter, Church characterized it as \\"Persian, adapted to the Occident\\". The furnishings Frederic and Isabel acquired over the course of their lives remain in the house. There are paintings by Frederic Church as well as artwork by his mentor Thomas Cole and friends Martin Johnson Heade and Erastus Dow Palmer. The dining room houses a collection of Old Master paintings. The eclectic assortment of furniture and decorative arts includes carpets, metalwork, ceramics and costumes from the Middle East, folk art and fine art from Mexico, and high-style American and Oriental furniture. The main residence at Olana has been described as a prime example of the Aesthetic Movement in America. Artworks created Frederic Church executed some of his most famous works at Olana, in a studio that stood on the hill above the Cosy Cottage. Throughout his life but especially in the 1850s, Church traveled throughout North and South America, making oil and pencil sketches that served as notes for the artwork to come. Although Church's major artworks appear to be transcriptions of the landscape, they are, as Church called them, \\"compositions\\"—composed from his sketches and his own artistic intentions. In the 1860s and 1870s this process occurred at Olana, and also at Church's Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City. Typically, Church did the bulk of his work in the studio at Olana, then finished the painting in New York. Church also made vibrant sketches of the Olana landscape; he framed a few and hung them in the main residence. In the studio at Olana he made hundreds of pencil and oil technical drawings for stencils, mantels, banisters, and other architectural elements of the main house. With the onset of rheumatism in the 1870s, Church's painting became severely curtailed. Increasingly, he turned his attention to Olana itself, improving the landscape, buying artwork for the house, and building the studio wing. Olana was one of several grand artist's homes in the Hudson River valley, comparable to Albert Bierstadt's Malkasten in Irvington (destroyed by fire in 1882) and Jasper Francis Cropsey's Ever Rest, in Hastings-on-Hudson. Viewshed The Olana Viewshed comprises panoramic views that begin in the Hudson River Valley and extend toward Massachusetts, Vermont, and Connecticut. To the west, the ridge of Sieghenburgh drops off abruptly, offering a view of the Hudson River through a series of native trees planted by Frederic Church in the nineteenth century. West of the Hudson River the eastern range of the Catskill Mountains can be viewed. To the southwest and south the terrain descends to Quarry Hill directing the eye three miles away toward Inbocht Bay. To the southeast and east Blue Hill rises in the distance. In 1876 a New York journalist reported \\"There are no finer views in the world than he can command from his windows.\\"Gerald L. Carr, 1989 Church spent over thirty years meticulously designing the landscape—including the excavation of an artificial lake in 1873 to mirror the Hudson and add balance to the viewshed—meanwhile producing dozens of oil sketches of the view from Olana.Trebilcock & Balint, 2009, p. 24 The property on Long Hill was purchased by Church because of its grand views: \\"To his skeptical father (who was financing the purchase), Church argued that the lot was important in 'securing fine openings for the views.'\\"Toole, 2010, p. 155 After Frederic Church's lifetime, the Olana Partnership has been pivotal in discouraging the production of two industrial projects that would have impeded the Olana Viewshed. In 1977, The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Power Authority of the State of New York held hearings on siting a nuclear power plant in Cementon, south of Catskill and in the Olana Viewshed. The proposed cooling tower would have reached 250 feet in diameter at its highest point discharging a heavy plume and obscuring views of the Catskill Mountains from several locations, including Olana. A painting of the south view of Olana by Frederic Church was used in the hearings as evidence to support the cultural and historical significance of the Olana Viewshed.Church, View from Olana in the Snow, 1870-75 In 1979 the Power Authority of the State of New York announced that it was abandoning plans for the proposed Cementon nuclear power plant. On September 14, 1998, St. Lawrence Cement announced plans for a 2.2 million ton coal-fired cement plant in Hudson and Greenport, New York, near the banks of the Hudson River. In 2001, Riverkeeper and a broad environmental coalition, including Olana, petitioned for consulting party status in a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation permit hearing for the proposed project. On April 24, 2005, after severe protest from the Hudson Valley community and environmentalists, St. Lawrence Cement abandoned the Greenport project Since 1992 Scenic Hudson and its conservation partners have contributed to the protection of more than 2,400 acres in the Olana Viewshed. In 2015, a conservation easement protected views from Letterbox Farm Collective, a farm nearby. Restoration and management Olana is managed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, with support from the Olana Partnership. Both work to restore Olana to its 1890s appearance. A large museum and archive, part of the original Church property, is open to the public and includes over 700 works by Church as well as thousands of works of art by other artists, including paintings by Martin Johnson Heade, Arthur Parton and John Thomas Peele and numerous works by Church's close friend, the sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer. The archive, open to scholars, contains letters, scrapbooks, bills, receipts and other ephemera.Carr, 1994 A visitor center is housed in the former carriage house, and an upstairs bedroom has been converted into the Evelyn and Maurice Sharp Gallery, which shows changing exhibitions of artwork drawn mainly from the archival collections. The site was closed during the 2006 season for extensive renovation. Stencils on the walls were stabilized and new carpeting was laid in the Court Hall. Curators and conservators performed rehabilitation work on furniture, upholstery and textiles. Fire safety and climate-control systems were improved. Commissioner Carol Ash said at the re-opening in May 2007, \\"The installation of new state- of-the-art equipment underscores the commitment of New York State to protect this remarkable historic landmark, and we look forward to once again showcasing the unique collections and extraordinary landscapes of one of our most important cultural resources.\\" The former wagon house in the barn complex now houses educational programs. Future plans include a reconstruction of the wagon house and a stabilization of the main barn, to better fit their role as year-round centers for education. Olana has been cited as an innovative example of a public-private partnership. Olana advocates the preservation of its viewshed by encouraging donations of scenic easements on properties and by discouraging development of industrial projects, such as a proposed cement plant and a proposed power plant. Historiography Olana has been the subject of scholarly study by a succession of students and experts on Church's life. David C. Huntington's cataloging and analysis in the mid-1960s is acknowledged as the first foundational work.Avery, 2005, p. 11 Huntington is credited not only with saving the site from public auction but with bringing Church's reputation from obscurity to prominence in relation to the Hudson River School. Huntington theorized that the sketches and paintings that Church displayed at Olana, ones he either kept outright or reacquired, were key to understanding the painter's personal values. Huntington supposed that the name \\"Olana\\" was a corruption of an ancient languageCarr, 2007, p. 120—an article to that effect had been published in the 1890s in the Boston Herald and believed for many decades.Ashbery, 2005, p. 266. Retrieved on April 8, 2010 In 1966, Huntington re-established this story, writing that the Arabic word Al'ana, meaning \\"our place on high\\", was possibly transliterated to Latin as \\"Olana\\". Art historian and Church scholar Gerald L. Carr found no confirmation that the Churches ever considered this meaning; instead, Carr believed the answer to be in a copy of Strabo's Geographica in Olana's library, a multi- volume reference work given by Isabel Church to her husband on Christmas 1879. One volume of this classic Greek work describes a fortified treasure-house named Olana, or Olane, situated on a hillside near the Araxes River in Artaxata, a city in modern-day Armenia, close to the eastern border of Turkey and the northwestern arm of Iran. Carr assumed that the Churches began calling their residence \\"Olana\\" after reading Strabo. John Ashbery agreed, writing in 1997 that Strabo's Artaxata \\"was one of the supposed sites of the Garden of Eden\\", and that the Churches must have felt kinship with both the idyllic and the protected qualities of ancient Olana. Visitation Olana is in the south part of Greenport, New York, in Columbia County, south of Hudson and east of Catskill. By car, the estate can be reached from New York State Route 9G, less than an hour's drive south of Albany. The nearest Amtrak train station is in Hudson. The grounds are open during the day throughout the year and the original carriage roads are accessible. Organized tours of the residence are generally available Tuesday through Sunday, and holiday Mondays, from April to October. From November to March, tours are conducted Friday through Sunday. Reservations for house tours are recommended. Photography is permitted anywhere on the grounds, including the interior of the house. The Hudson River Skywalk, a pedestrian walkway across the Rip Van Winkle Bridge opened in 2019, connects the site to the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in Catskill. In popular culture * Olana was featured in Bob Vila's A&E; Network four-part production, Guide to Historic Homes of America. For the first episode, on the subject of historic homes in the Northeastern U.S., Vila and his crew traveled to five locations containing historic structures, including Olana. *The Marc Cohn 1998 album Burning the Daze features a song titled \\"Olana,\\" about Church and the building of the estate.

The school was formed in 1967 by combining Skiles Middle School, which had taught grades 6-8 and sat on the site of the current King Arts School and the original Martin Luther King Jr. Laboratory School, which had taught grades K-5 and was housed in the building of the old Foster School at Foster and Dewey. History Foster School was a de facto segregated school in Evanston, Illinois named after Northwestern University president Randolph Sinks Foster. Founded in 1903 and opened in 1905, Foster School began with a one hundred percent white student body and faculty, but by 1945 it was nearly one hundred percent African American.Gavin, Larry. Evanston Roundtable, \\"A History of Foster School and Desegregation in School District 65.\\" June 19, 2002. Accessed July 10, 2012. http://evanstonroundtable.com/main.asp? Foster School was one of the only public schools in the Evanston area where African American children were encouraged to attend and where African-American teachers could find employment until 1967, when School District 65 was desegregated. The Foster School Reunion collection is housed at the Shorefront Legacy Center in Evanston, Illinois. The collection was processed by the Black Metropolis Consortium as part of the Color Curtain Processing Project. In 1967, Foster School transitioned into the Martin Luther King Jr. Laboratory School in which 25% of the school's student body was African American during the first year of enrollment. The school moved from the Foster School building into the Skiles Middle School building in 1976. By contrast with contemporaneous forced bussing of African-American students to historically white schools, King Lab as a magnet school brought voluntarily bussed white, Asian and Latino students to attend school on the site of Evanston's historically African-American school (Foster School) in its predominantly African-American neighborhood. This project integrated its schools while improving educational opportunities for Evanston's African-American children. As the declining student population was causing a number of Evanston's elementary schools to close (including Foster School), the King Lab project survived by combining with Skiles Middle School, first in 1976 as a transitional grade 5-8 program called Ski-Lab on the site of Skiles Middle School and then moving grades K-4 to the site in 1978 to form a K-8 program under the name Martin Luther King Junior Laboratory School. In 2011, following the school district's strategic planning initiative, the school took on a new \\"literary and fine arts focus,\\" causing its renaming.

Usually the moving parts slide with respect to each other, or one part rotates within the other. The ball is a single, usually metal sphere, sliding within a bored cylinder, against the pressure of a spring, which pushes the ball against the other part of the mechanism, which carries the detent - which can be as simple as a hole of smaller diameter than the ball. When the hole is in line with the cylinder, the ball falls partially into the hole under spring pressure, holding the parts at that position. Additional force applied to the moving parts will push the ball back into its cylinder, compressing the spring, and allowing the parts to move to another position. Ball detents are commonly found in the selector mechanism of a gearbox, holding the selector rods in the correct position to engage the desired gear. Other applications include clutches that slip at a preset torque, and calibrated ball detent mechanisms are typically found in a torque wrench. Ball detents are one of the mechanisms often used in folding knives to prevent unwanted opening of the blade when carrying it. Use in Paintball Markers The term \\"ball detent\\" is also used when referring to a mechanism in paintball markers designed to prevent the paintball from rolling out of the firing chamber before being fired. Some designs are similar to those outlined above, with a cartridge utilizing a ball bearing in a bore with spring pressure. The cartridge is installed perpendicular to the barrel bore axis, just ahead of where the ball rests before being fired. Other designs use elastic rubber protrusions that block the ball until it is pushed over it by the bolt. Some designs use precisely calibrated rings or \\"barrel sizers\\" that are selected to have a slightly smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the paintballs being used. They rely on simple constriction of the bore to prevent paintballs from rolling through them from the force of gravity. When the marker is fired, the air pressure pushes the ball through the bore, causing it to compress enough to pass through. Paintballs have varying diameters depending on a number of factors; this type of ball detent must be sized correctly to avoid compressing the paintball too much, causing it to burst. If too large of a sizer is selected, balls may roll through it. The cartridge and elastic rubber protrusion type detents are primarily used for open bolt markers, or on closed bolt markers to prevent double feeding (feeding more than one ball when the bolt is open for loading). Closed bolt markers generally use the constriction method to prevent \\"roll outs\\", a malfunction where the ball completely rolls out of the barrel, causing no paintball to be fired when the trigger is pulled. A partial roll out is when the ball rolls partially through the barrel, causing reduced velocity.

Legend Entertainment released it in 1994. It received several gaming awards. GOG.com released an emulated version for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux in January 2018. It was removed from sale two months later. Overview Players take on the role of Haplo, who is the main character of the book series. Most of the realms in the books are used in the game, with the exception of the Seventh Gate, but they are not presented identically to the books. For instance, the Vortex of the game is a mix of features from the Vortex and the Seventh Gate of the books. The plot differs considerably and many major book characters are not featured, including Bane, Marit, and Alfred. The game was released with a short story called \\"Forever Falling\\" written by Weis and Hickman with Kevin Stein. It tells the story of how Ciang became the Head of the Brotherhood of the Hand, an assassins' guild featured in both the books and the game. The story serves as backstory to events in The Death Gate Cycle and has little relation to Death Gate. The box features the cover art that Keith Parkinson painted for the third book, Fire Sea. Death Gate runs in DOS and features voice acting and SVGA graphics. At the time it was released, the graphics and animation were considered impressive. Story The player takes the role of Haplo and starts in the Nexus with Lord Xar. Lord Xar tasks Haplo to visit the four worlds, Arianus, Pryan, Abarrach and Chelestra and retrieve the seal pieces of these worlds. Xar plans to undo the Sundering with the Reformation, the act of recreating the Earth again and he needs the seal pieces to do so. To travel to the other worlds, Haplo is given a ship with a magical steering stone. If the symbol of a world is magically engraved on it, the ship can travel to that world through the Death Gate. Xar gives Haplo the symbol of Arianus, the realm of air, and Haplo sets sail. Arianus Haplo arrives on the lower realm of Arianus, inhabited by dwarves. A dwarf called Limbeck studies a machine called the Kicksey-winsey. Glowing figures try to get the Kicksey- winsey to work. According to the dwarves they are gods. Haplo manages to get aboard the ship of the gods and finds out they are elves. He finds human slaves that operate the ship. One of them is the cousin of the human king, King Stephen. Haplo brings a message to King Stephen and returns to the elven ship. He manages to break the glowing spell of the elves. The dwarves expel the elves and the elven ship leaves. Haplo manages to lure it into a human ambush and the slaves are rescued. On his search for the seal piece, Haplo goes to Skurvash, a smuggler's den. He manages to catch the attention of Hugh the Hand and infiltrates the Brotherhood. In their tower he finds an artifact of Sartan origin as well as a manual to the Kicksey-winsey and the book of Pryan. He returns to the Kicksey-winsey, fixes it and uses it to dig a tunnel to a secret chamber. Inside he finds crystal coffins with Sartan. All are dead. Haplo manages to find the seal piece of Arianus in the chamber. He returns to the Nexus and hands Xar the seal piece. Xar then sends Haplo to Pryan, the realm of Fire. Haplo transfers Pryan's symbol from the book onto the steering stone and ventures through the Death Gate. Pryan Haplo lands near a huge citadel but can't enter. In the forest he encounters giant creatures called tytans. Being stuck he sets sail to a city he had seen. He encounters elves. He meets a group of elven and human children, including the elven prince. They take him to one of their secret meetings with a wizard called Zifnab. Haplo follows Zifnab. He meets Zifnab and his dragon. Zifnab seems to be a crazy wizard but Haplo learns that Zifnab is a Sartan. Zifnab senses that Haplo is very important even though he is a Patryn. He tells Haplo that the Citadel is supposed to generate power for the other realms and that the tytans are supposed to operate it. Inside the Citadel is the seal piece of Pryan. But the Citadel is closed and can only be opened by the mensch with three specific objects, a golden staff, a golden sword and a golden hammer. The golden sword is carried by the human leader and is currently in hands of the human princess. The golden staff had been given to the elves but one king tossed it into a giant crevice known as the 'Maw'. The golden hammer is in possession of the dwarves. Haplo needs the humans, elves and dwarves to use their golden items to open the citadel. But he also needs to distract the tytans who seem to worship a crystal fragment and have forgotten about their tasks for the citadel. Zifnab also tells Haplo of the Wave, the balance of the universe and that his dragon was created by the Wave trying to restore the balance, in response to something very evil that happened a long time ago. He gives Haplo a stone that will glow when he will encounter this evil and tells Haplo to crush the stone when that happens. Haplo retrieves the golden staff and convinces the human princess and the elven prince to accompany him to the Citadel. In the forest they free a dwarven girl from the tytans. The girls tells him that the hammer is stashed in the vault and that the vault is only opened when the dwarves go to war. With help from the princess and the prince, Haplo manages to steal the crystal fragment which enrages the tytans. Haplo tosses it into the dwarven tunnels and the tytans start attacking it. The dwarven girl obtains the hammer and the mensch open the Citadel and the tytans take their place. Zifnab allows Haplo to take the seal piece even though he knows that Lord Xar wants to conquer the realms and rid it of the Sartan. Haplo returns to the Nexus and delivers the seal piece to Xar who sends Haplo to Abarrach, the realm of Earth. On the crystal fragment, Haplo finds the symbol of Abarrach and transfers it to his steering stone. Abarrach Haplo arrives in a deserted city populated by undead Sartan. He manages to find the journal of Balthazar, a royal necromancer and learns the location of the palace of the dynasty of Abarrach. Haplo visits this dynast, Kleitus the XIV. Kleitus senses that Haplo is a Patryn and poisons him. Haplo is thrown into a dungeon where he meets Edmund, a Sartan prince, who is poisoned as well. By possessing the dog of Kleitus, Haplo manages to get the antidote and the keys to their chains and they escape. Edmund takes Haplo to his people and he meets Balthazar in the refugee caves. Balthazar tells him that the mensch perished a long time ago and the Sartan are slowly being extinct by what they call 'The Plague'. Haplo finds a secret tunnel and has a vision of the time of Kleitus I. He also finds a book which condemns necromancy. For every resurrected dead Sartan, one dies an untimely death. The practice of necromancy is the source of the Plague and responsible for killing the Sartan on Arianus. Haplo also learns that Kleitus I has sabotaged the Colossus, which channels the energy of Abarrach and used a part of it to make him a powerful scepter that can kill anyone instantly. Haplo manages to return to the palace, find and fix the Colossus and Kleitus XIV is killed by Edmund. Edmund realized that Haplo is a Patryn, but sees him as a friend since Haplo helped him and his people. He gives Haplo an amulet out of gratitude. The amulet contains the symbols of the five realms, Arianus, Pryan, Abarrach, Chelestra and the Nexus. Haplo retrieves the seal piece of Arianus from the secret room of the Colossus and returns to the Nexus. Xar hastily sends Haplo to Chelestra, the realm of Water. Haplo transfers the symbol of Chelestra from the amulet to the steering stone and heads off. Chelestra Haplo arrives near a Sartan city that is warded by a powerful shield spell. He also finds a cave and his stone glows faintly. Unspeakable terror prohibits from entering. He neutralizes the ward of the Sartan city and is attacked by Sang-Drax, who appears a black winged dragon with red eyes. Sang-Drax tosses the stone away, being afraid of it. Haplo is terrified and nearly can't move. Just before Sang-Drax burns his body, he transfers his soul to the dog, that has been following him since Abarrach and escapes into the city. Haplo's body is restored with his soul by Samah, the Sartan that lead the council that destroyed the world. Sang-Drax enters the now unshielded city and steals the final seal piece and changes his form to Haplo and leaves. Samah tells him that Sang-Drax will try to make Xar proceed with the Reformation. The Reformation will result in the death of the mensch, Sartan and Patryns, and have catastrophic consequences. Samah tells Haplo that the Interconnection must be done. The realms will align and function according to the old Sartan plan. Pryan will generate power for all realms, Abarrach will supply raw materials for the Kicksey-winsey, the Kicksey-winsey will use the raw materials to make tools and materials for all worlds and Chelestra will supply water to the worlds. All this is done through the Death Gate. They give Haplo a Sartan ship without a steering stone. Haplo manages to find a substitute and transfers the symbols from the amulet on to it. He retrieves the stone and returns to the Nexus. The Nexus & the Labyrinth Haplo finds Xar and the Nexus seal piece gone. He follows them through the Labyrinth, encountering a Patryn village that is under attack. He manages to find a cave. He encounters Sang-Drax again. He drinks nullifying water, which nullifies his magical abilities. That makes him immune to all kinds of magic, including Sang-Drax's aura of terror but also prohibits Haplo from casting magic. He breaks Zifnab's stone and Zifnab and his dragon appear. The dragon fights Sang-Drax and both are injured. Zifnab, Haplo and the dragon follow Sang-Drax to the Vortex, the place where the Sundering had been initiated. Haplo finds Xar and Sang-Drax and convinces Xar to start the Interconnection. Sang-drax kills Xar before he can do so. Haplo figures out how to start the Interconnection himself and does so. Sang-Drax is defeated and the realms are properly aligned. Characters *Haplo: Haplo is the main character and controlled by the player. He is a Patryn and is commanded by his Lord Xar to find the four seal pieces of the realms Arianus, Pryan, Abarrach and Chelestra. Unlike the book, Haplo has no dog as a companion until he reaches Abarrach, where he finds the dog of Kleitus. In the book Haplo had a dog as a companion from the beginning. Also Haplo isn't nearly as powerful as in the books, probably due to gameplay reasons. He can be easily killed by some mensch if you make the wrong choices. *Lord Xar: Xar is the most powerful Patryn, the first Patryn to escape the Labyrinth and Lord of the Nexus. He is intended to take revenge on the Sartan. He wants to five seal pieces of the five realms to bring about the Reformation which is supposed to restore the Earth to its former form and undo the Sundering. He intends to rule all the mensch. Like the character from the books he is dedicated and determined to destroy the Sartan. In the game, he is far more easily convinced not to proceed with the Reformation though. *Zifnab: Just as in the book, Zifnab appears as a crazy wizard. Zifnab is important, explaining a lot about the workings of the Citadels and giving Haplo the stone to combat true evil. He later returns with his dragon to fight Sang-Drax and save Haplo so that Haplo can bring about the Interconnection. The game makes no connection however between Zifnab and the Labyrinth and the books found in the Nexus. His dragon also seems to be the only one of its kind. *Sang-Drax: Sang-Drax is portrayed as a winged dragon, rather than a serpent. Unlike the books he is also the only one of his kind and his origins are never really explained. In the books the serpents are the embodiment of Evil, which were given form by the Sundering. In the game Zifnab simply states that at one point something very evil was created and that his dragon was created in response. Reception In PC Gamer US, Trent C.

It is named after the American chemist George Scatchard. Equation Throughout this article, [RL] denotes the concentration of a receptor-ligand complex, [R] the concentration of free receptor, and [L] the concentration of free ligand (so that the total concentration of the receptor and ligand are [R]+[RL] and [L]+[RL], respectively). Let n be the number of binding sites for ligand on each receptor molecule, and let represent the average number of ligands bound to a receptor. Let Kd denote the dissociation constant between the ligand and receptor. The Scatchard equation is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\bar{n}}{[L]} = \\\\frac{n}{K_d} - \\\\frac{\\\\bar{n}}{K_d} By plotting /[L] versus , the Scatchard plot shows that the slope equals to -1/Kd while the x-intercept equals the number of ligand binding sites n. Derivation =n=1 Ligand= When each receptor has a single ligand binding site, the system is described by : [R] + [L] \\\\underset{k_{\\\\text{off}}}{\\\\overset{k_{\\\\text{on}}}{\\\\rightleftharpoons}} [RL] with an on-rate (kon) and off-rate (koff) related to the dissociation constant through Kd=koff/kon. When the system equilibrates, : k_{\\\\text{on}} [R] [L] = k_{\\\\text{off}} [RL] so that the average number of ligands bound to each receptor is given by : \\\\bar{n} = \\\\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} = \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} = (1 - \\\\bar{n}) \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d} which is the Scatchard equation for n=1. =n=2 Ligands= When each receptor has two ligand binding sites, the system is governed by : [R] + [L] \\\\underset{k_{\\\\text{off}}}{\\\\overset{2k_{\\\\text{on}}}{\\\\rightleftharpoons}} [RL] : [RL] + [L] \\\\underset{2k_{\\\\text{off}}}{\\\\overset{k_{\\\\text{on}}}{\\\\rightleftharpoons}} [RL_2]. At equilibrium, the average number of ligands bound to each receptor is given by : \\\\bar{n} = \\\\frac{[RL] + 2[RL_2]}{[R] + [RL] + [RL_2]} = \\\\frac{2\\\\frac{[L]}{K_d} + 2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d} \\\\right)^2}{\\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d} \\\\right)^2} = \\\\frac{2[L]}{K_d + [L]} = (2 - \\\\bar{n}) \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d} which is equivalent to the Scatchard equation. =General Case of n Ligands= For a receptor with n binding sites that independently bind to the ligand, each binding site will have an average occupancy of [L]/(Kd \\\\+ [L]). Hence, by considering all n binding sites, there will : \\\\bar{n} = n \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} = (n - \\\\bar{n}) \\\\frac{[L]}{K_d}. ligands bound to each receptor on average, from which the Scatchard equation follows. Problems with the method The Scatchard method is less used nowadays because of the availability of computer programs that directly fit parameters to binding data. Mathematically, the Scatchard equation is related to Eadie- Hofstee method, which is used to infer kinetic properties from enzyme reaction data. Many modern methods for measuring binding such as surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry provide additional binding parameters that are globally fit by computer-based iterative methods.

It lists the popes in chronological order and all officials of the Holy See's departments. It also provides names and contact information for all cardinals and bishops, the dioceses (with statistics about each), the departments of the Roman Curia, the Holy See's diplomatic missions abroad, the embassies accredited to the Holy See, the headquarters of religious institutes (again with statistics on each), certain academic institutions, and other similar information. The index includes, along with all the names in the body of the book, those of all priests who have been granted the title of \\"Monsignor\\". The red-covered yearbook, compiled by the Central Statistics Office of the Church and published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, is mostly in Italian. The 2015 edition had more than 2,400 pages and cost . According to the Pontifical Yearbook of 2019, the number of Catholics in the world increased to 1,313,278,000 at the end of 2017. History A yearbook of the Catholic Church was published, with some interruptions, from 1716 to 1859 by the Cracas printing firm in Rome, under the title Information for the Year ... (') From 1851, a department of the Holy See began producing a different publication called Hierarchy of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church Worldwide ('), which took the title Annuario Pontificio in 1860 but ceased publication in 1870. This was the first yearbook published by the Holy See itself, but its compilation was entrusted to the newspaper Giornale di Roma. The Monaldi Brothers () began in 1872 to produce their own yearbook entitled The Catholic Hierarchy and the Papal Household for the Year ... ('). The Vatican Press took over the Gerarchia Cattolica in 1885, thus making it a semi-official publication. It bore the indication \\"official publication\\" from 1899 to 1904, but this ceased when, giving the word \\"official\\" a more restricted sense, the Acta Sanctae Sedis, forerunner of the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, was declared the only \\"official\\" publication of the Holy See. In 1912, it resumed the title Annuario Pontificio. From 1912 to 1924, it included not only lists of names, but also brief illustrative notes on departments of the Roman Curia and on certain posts within the papal court, a practice to which it returned in 1940. For some years, beginning in 1898, the Maison de la Bonne Presse publishing house of Paris produced a similar yearbook in French called Annuaire Pontifical Catholique, not compiled by the Holy See. This contained much additional information, such as detailed historical articles on the Swiss Guards and the Papal Palace at the Vatican.  List of popes  The Annuario Pontificio provides the Catholic Church's list of popes. As historical questions are reinterpreted by each successive pope, they are recognized in the Annuario Pontificio. For example, the 1942 Annuario Pontificio recognized the decisions of the Council of Pisa (1409), listing three popes for the period: Gregory XII (1406–1409), Alexander V (1409–1410), and John XXIII (1410–1415). The Western Schism was reinterpreted when Pope John XXIII (1958–1963) chose to reuse the ordinal XXIII, citing \\"twenty-two Johns of indisputable legitimacy.\\" This was reflected in the 1963 Annuario Pontificio, which treated Alexander V and the first John XXIII as antipopes.  Statistical data  Many churches try to obtain accurate ecclesiastical statistics by actively counting their congregants. The Annuario Pontificio superseded the French Annuaire pontifical catholique in providing global statistics on the Roman Catholic Church and arranges such data by diocese; the Statistical Yearbook of the Church arranges the same data by country and continent.

It describes the nature of the international system at any given period of time. One generally distinguishes three types of systems: unipolarity, bipolarity, and multipolarity for three or more centers of power. The type of system is completely dependent on the distribution of power and influence of states in a region or globally. It is widely believed amongst theorists in international relations that the post–Cold War international system is unipolar: The United States' defense spending is \\"close to half of global military expenditures; a blue-water navy superior to all others combined; a chance at a powerful nuclear first strike over its erstwhile foe, Russia; a defense research and development budget that is 80 percent of the total defense expenditures of its most obvious future competitor, China; and unmatched global power-projection capabilities.\\" Unipolarity Unipolarity in international politics is a distribution of power in which one state exercises most of the cultural, economic, and military influence. Nuno P. Monteiro, assistant professor of political science at Yale University, argues that three features are endemic to unipolar systems: * Unipolarity is an interstate system and not an empire. Monteiro cites Robert Jervis of Columbia University to support his claim; Jervis argues that “unipolarity implies the existence of many juridically equal nation- states, something that an empire denies.” Monteiro illustrates this point further through Daniel Nexon and Thomas Wright, who state that “in empires, inter-societal divide-and-rule practices replace interstate balance-of-power dynamics.” * Unipolarity is anarchical. Anarchy results from the incomplete power preponderance of the unipole. Columbia University's Kenneth Waltz, whom Monteiro cites, argues that a great power cannot “exert a positive control everywhere in the world.” Therefore, relatively weaker countries have the freedom to pursue policy preferences independent of the unipole. The power projection limitations of the unipole is a distinguishing characteristic between unipolar and hegemonic systems. * Unipolar systems possess only one great power and face no competition. If a competitor emerges, the international system is no longer unipolar. In 1964, Kenneth Waltz maintained that the United States is the only “pole” to possess global interests. Apart from excelling in indicators of power such as population, resource endowment, economic capacity, and military might, unipoles are associated with certain foreign policy behaviors like actively participating in binding regional institutions; building ad hoc coalitions of the willing to deal with major security or economic challenges; struggling for legitimacy without applying much coercion; and respecting the sovereignty of second-tier states, who are considered crucial partners.Schenoni, L. (2017) “Subsystemic Unipolarities? Power Distribution and State Behaviour in South America and Southern Africa\\" Strategic Analysis, 41(1), p. 75. Available at:https://www.academia.edu/30528886/_Subsystemic_Unipolarities_Power_Distribution_and_State_Behaviour_in_South_America_and_Southern_Africa_in_Strategic_Analysis_41_1_74-86 William Wohlforth believes unipolarity is peaceful because According to Wohlforth, “Therefore one pole is best, and security competition among the great powers should be minimal.” Unipolarity generates few incentives for security and prestige competition among great powers. This idea is based on hegemonic stability theory and the rejection of the balance of power theory. Hegemonic stability theory stipulates that The balance of power theory, by contrast, stipulates that as long as the international system remains in balance (without unipolar power), peace is maintained. Nuno P. Monteiro argues that international relations theorists have long debated the durability of unipolarity (i.e. when it will end) but have had less debate about the relative peacefulness unipolarity brings among nations within an international system. Rather than comparing the relative peacefulness of unipolarity, multipolarity, and bipolarity, he identifies causal pathways to war that are endemic to a unipolar system. Monteiro does not question the impossibility of great power war in a unipolar world, which is a central tenet of Wohlforth in his book World Out of Balance: International Relations and the Challenge of American Primacy. Instead he believes “unipolar systems provide incentives for two other types of war: those pitting the sole great power against a relatively weaker state and those exclusively involving weaker states.” Monteiro's hypothesis is influenced by the first two decades of the post-Cold War environment, one that is defined as unipolar and rife with wars. Monteiro writes, “The United States has been at war for thirteen of the twenty-two years since the end of the Cold War. Put another way, the first two decades of unipolarity, which make up less than 10 percent of U.S. history, account for more than 25 percent of the nation’s total time at war.” The earliest prophet of unipolarity seems to have been Johann Gottlieb Fichte, although he did not use the term (he used the term \\"Universal Monarchy\\" instead). Paradoxically, the father of German nationalism and convinced adherent of the balance of power theory, appears to be the path-breaker. In 1806, Fichte wrote Characteristics of the Present Age. In 1806, Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia after the Battle of Jena. The challenge of Napoleon revealed to Fichte the precarious nature of the balance of power and a much deeper and dominant historical trend: American primacy The first thinker to anticipate both the unipolar world and the American primacy seems to have been British politician William Gladstone. In 1878, Gladstone wrote: French economist Michel Chevalier, writing in 1866, did not address the possibility of a unipolar world, but envisaged that the “political colossus who is being created at the other side of the Atlantic” would overshadow Europe by the end of the nineteenth century. Unless Europe united, he wrote, it would be “weak and exposed to disastrous defeats” in the confrontation with the New World.Michel Chevalier, ‘La Guerre et la Crise Européenne’, Revue des Deux Mondes, (1 June 1866), p. 784–785, https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Guerre_et_la_Crise_europ%C3%A9enne In 1885, the Chinese Philosopher, K'ang Yu-wei published his One World Philosophy, where he based his vision on the evidence of political expansion which began in the immemorial past and went in his days on.K'ang Yu-wei, (1885): The One World Philosophy, (tr. Thompson, Lawrence G., London, 1958, pp. 79-85). He concludes: No factor, he believed, in the long run could resist the \\"laws of empires.\\" K'ang Yu-wei projects the culmination of the ongoing world unification with the final confrontation between the United States and Germany: \\"Some day America will take in [all the states of] the American continent and Germany will take in all the [states of] Europe. This will hasten the world along the road to One World.\\" K'ang Yu-wei belonged to a civilization, which experienced the millennia-long unipolar order. He knew how in his civilization it emerged and several times reemerged. Naturally, his theory is very realist, deep, and developed relatively to his Western contemporaries convinced in the universality of the balance of power or, at most, having abstract ideas of the \\"Parliament of men, the Federation of the world.\\"Alfred Tennyson, Locksley Hall: 128, (1842), http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/locksley-hall Another early scientist who drew a hypothesis of the forthcoming unipolar world order and the American primacy was the French Demographer, Georges Vacher de Lapouge, with his L\`Aryen: Son Role Social published in 1899. Similarly to K'ang Yu-wei, he outlined the logistic growth of empires from the Bronze Age till his days, when \\"six states govern... three quarters of the globe,\\" and concluded: \\"The moment is close when the struggle for the domination of the world is going to take place.\\"Georges Vacher de Lapouge, L\`Aryen: Son Role Social, (Nantes, 1899: chapter \\"L\`Avenir des Aryens,\\" pp. XXXI-XXXII). Vacher de Lapouge did not bet on Washington and Berlin in the final contest for world domination like K'ang Yu-wei. Similarly to de Tocqueville, he guessed the Cold War contenders correctly but he went one step further. He estimated the chances of the United States as favorite in the final confrontation: The year after Vacher de Lapouge published his vision, H. G. Wells in Anticipations (1900) envisaged that \\"the great urban region between Chicago and the Atlantic” will unify the English-speaking states, and this larger English-speaking unit, “a New Republic dominating the world,” will by the year 2000 become the means “by which the final peace of the world may be assured forever.\\" It will be “a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle.” Such a synthesis \\"of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as possible, but as a probable, thing.”Anticipations, pp 100–101. The New Republic “will already be consciously and pretty freely controlling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes…” Its principles and opinions “must necessarily shape and determine that still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the opening phase.” The New Republic must ultimately become a \\"World-State.\\"Anticipations, p 107. Wells' compatriot, Journalist William Thomas Stead, titled his 1901 book The Americanization of the World or the Trend of the Twentieth Century. The visions of William Gladstone, Vacher de Lapouge, H. G. Wells and William Thomas Stead were borne out. The United States is the only country in the early 21st century that possesses the ability to project military power on a global scale, providing its full command of the global commons. With no viable challenger on the horizon in the short term, the current distribution of power overwhelmingly favors the United States, making the world order it set out to construct in 1945 more robust. The question that remains for international relations theorists is how long this “unipolar moment” will last. Sean M. Lynn-Jones, editor of International Security, provides a summary of arguments put forth by Kenneth Waltz, John Ikenberry, and Barry Posen. = Kenneth Waltz = Kenneth Waltz, the founder of Neorealism, in his epochal Theory of International Politics (1979) precluded the possibility of unipolarity. Two, he stated (1979: 136), is the smallest possible number of poles in a system. Within twelve years, unipolarity emerged. In two papers of 1993--“Structural Realism after the Cold War” and \\"The Emerging Structure of International Politics\\"—Waltz defends the neorealist theory against a cascade of criticism that emerged after the Cold War. First of all, he stresses that unipolarity is “the least durable of international configurations.”\\"Structural Realism After the Cold War,\\" International Security, 25/1, (2000): p 27. He provides a realist analysis of the currently unipolar structure of world politics, arguing that realism is the best theoretical lens to understanding international politics and the short future of U.S. primacy. Waltz also takes on democratic peace theory, which holds that no two democracies will go to war with each other, as one that doesn't present a proper challenge to realism. War is rooted in the anarchic structure, or a self-help environment, of the international system, Waltz argues. Simply changing the domestic political structure of countries will not eliminate war, Waltz notes. However, “democracies seldom fight democracies”, although democracies are more likely to initiate wars against non-democracies because the former believes the latter must become democratized so as to make the democratic peace more robust. Thus, the spread of democracy can decrease the amount of war in the world in Waltz's view. The second challenge to realist theory argues that economic interdependence promotes peace. Waltz believes this causal logic is backward: Peace can promote economic interdependence. Peace abounds when a political monopoly on force, or a favorable balance of power, prevents revisionist powers from altering the status quo. After all, Waltz argues, strong economic interdependence did not prevent war in 1914. The third challenge that Waltz confronts is the rise of international institutions as primary actors in international politics. Waltz argues that the structure of power in the international system determines the role of institutions. NATO, for example, is often cited as an institution that has outlived its original mandate—preventing a Soviet onslaught of Western Europe. In Waltz's view, NATO's continued existence conveniently “illustrates how international institutions are created and maintained by stronger states (e.g., the United States) to serve their perceived and misperceived interests.” Finally, Waltz turns to the question of international politics and provides a realist interpretation to the U.S. unipolar moment, which he believes is fleeting for two reasons. With no great power to check its adventurism, the United States will weaken itself by misusing its power internationally. “Wide latitude” of “policy choices” will allow the U.S. to act capriciously on the basis of “internal political pressure and national ambition.” Secondly, even if the United States acts benevolently, states will still attempt to balance against it because the power asymmetry demands it: In a self-help system, states do not worry about other states’ intentions as they do other states' capabilities. “Unbalanced power leaves weaker states feeling uneasy and gives them reason to strengthen their positions,” Waltz says. He sees China as already beginning to counter U.S. power. In conclusion, the U.S. unipolar moment is fleeting and multipolarity is already materializing. = Thomas Mowle and David Sacko = As the unipolarity persisted longer than Waltz expected, Thomas Mowle and David Sacko published a book titled, The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future (2007).New York: Palgrave Macmillan. “This book, they introduce, develops a theory of unipolar politics to complete Waltz’s theory.”The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future, p 29. They explain the necessity of the subject: The “something previously unseen” is the fact that the power of the United States remains unbalanced. “To date, political science has not explained this puzzle.” Realism “has little to say about this situation.” The “leading theory of international politics is lost because it expects a world of multiple major powers. Realists expect states to balance against rising powers, which would prevent a unipolar distribution of power from developing.”The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future, p 2. Mowle and Sacko offer an explanation to the failure of research on unipolarity: Although unipolarity is generally undesirable, it prevails: “While many people wish that power were distributed in a different manner, unipolarity is real.”The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future, p 143. It seems natural, therefore, that structural realism should develop a set of hypotheses for a unipolar world. Instead, however, realists have “resisted the conclusion that the world is unipolar and sought evidence of balancing by other states. In particular, some have advanced the concept of soft balancing—balancing that does not balance at all.” These efforts are counter-productive, since realism and unipolarity are compatible. “Scholars, they advise in conclusion, do not need to desperately search for signs of balancing, they do not need to soften balancing beyond recognition, and they do not need to stand watch for the first glimmering of a new multipolar dawn.”The Unipolar World: An Unbalanced Future, p 147, 158. = John Ikenberry = In “Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and Persistence of American Postwar Order,” John Ikenberry explains why other great powers decided not to balance against the United States after the Cold War ended.Dall'Agnol, Augusto C. Vol. 7, No. 3 (2018), pp. 494-515, for further discussions and critics on Ikenberry's core arguments. In his view, realist predictions of power balancing did not bear fruit because the United States engaged in strategic restraint after World War II, thereby convincing weaker states that it was more interested in cooperation rather than domination. U.S. strategic restraint allowed weaker countries to participate in the make-up of the post-war world order, which limited opportunities for the United States to exploit total power advantages. Ikenberry notes that while the United States could have unilaterally engaged in unfettered power projection, it decided instead to “lock in” its advantage long after zenith by establishing an enduring institutional order, gave weaker countries a voice, reduced great power uncertainty, and mitigated the security dilemma, a concept known as Lock in thesishttps://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/.../ia/INTA94_1_6_249_Layne.pdf p16 The liberal basis of U.S. hegemony—a transparent democratic political system—has made it easier for other countries to accept the post-war order, Ikenberry explains. “American hegemony is reluctant, open, and highly institutionalized—or in a word, liberal” and “short of large-scale war or a global economic crisis, the American hegemonic order appears to be immune to would-be hegemonic challengers.” = Barry Posen = In “Command of the Commons: The Military Foundation of U.S. Hegemony,” Barry Posen focuses exclusively on U.S. military capabilities. A key to U.S. preeminence is “command of the commons—command of the sea, space, and air.” But command of the commons and the U.S. persistence in maintaining its near omnipresence raise important questions for U.S. strategy: “Even before the September 11 terrorist attacks, the foreign policy debate had narrowed to a dispute between primacy and selective engagement, between nationalist, unilateralist version of hegemony, and a liberal, multilateral version of hegemony.” U.S. command of the commons, Posen argues, provides a strong case for selective engagement. Posen believes that the Bush Doctrine was problematic because it not only created unease among U.S. allies, but also caused “others to ally against the United States.” Securing the commons through selective engagement is a superior strategy because it is cost effective, secures U.S. interests, and makes the nearly omnipresent U.S. military tolerable because it provides security guarantees to other nations.  Bipolarity  Bipolarity is a distribution of power in which two states have the majority of economic, military, and cultural influence internationally or regionally.Jiang, Shiwei. \\"Is Bipolarity a sound recipe for world order–as compared to other historically known alternatives.\\" In ICD Annual Conference on Cultural Diplomacy in the USA\\" Options on the Table,\\" Soft Power, Intercultural Dialogue & the Future of US Foreign Policy. 2013. Often, spheres of influence would develop. For example, in the Cold War, most Western and capitalist states would fall under the influence of the US, while most Communist states would fall under the influence of the USSR. After this, the two powers will normally maneuver for the support of the unclaimed areas. Which in the case of the Cold War means Africa, etc. (refer to map below). Spheres of influence of the two Cold War superpowers (the US and the USSR) in 1959. ''''' * Great Britain and France in 18th century since the end of the War of the Spanish Succession until the Seven Years' War (1754-1763). *The United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War (1947-1991); however, the Sino-Soviet split (c. 1960) led to the rise of China as a possible third superpower.  Multi-state examples of bipolarity  The bipolar system can be said to extend to much larger systems, such as alliances or organizations, which would not be considered nation-states, but would still have power concentrated in two primary groups. In both World Wars, much of the world, and especially Europe, the United States, and Japan had been divided into two respective spheres - one case being the Axis and Allies of World War II (1939-1945) - and the division of power between the Central Powers and Allied powers during World War I (1914-1918). Neutral nations, however, may have caused what may be assessed as an example of tripolarity as well within both of the conflicts. The NATO and Warsaw Pact groupings could also be considered to be bipolar if one does not include the Non-Aligned Movement.  Multipolarity  Multipolarity is a distribution of power in which more than two nation-states have nearly equal amounts of military, cultural, and economic influence. Empires of the world in 1905, with minor mistakes. Opinions on the stability of multipolarity differ. Classical realist theorists, such as Hans Morgenthau and E. H. Carr, hold that multipolar systems are more stable than bipolar systems, as great powers can gain power through alliances and petty wars that do not directly challenge other powers; in bipolar systems, classical realists argue, this is not possible. On the other hand, the neorealist focuses on security and inverts the formula: states in a multipolar system can focus their fears on any number of other powers and, misjudging the intentions of other states, unnecessarily compromise their security, while states in a bipolar system always focus their fears on one other power, meaning that at worst the powers will miscalculate the force required to counter threats and spend slightly too much on the operation. However, due to the complexity of mutually assured destruction scenarios, with nuclear weapons, multipolar systems may be more stable than bipolar systems even in the neorealist analysis. This system tends to have many shifting alliances until one of two things happens. Either a balance of power is struck, and neither side wants to attack the other, or one side will attack the other because it either fears the potential of the new alliance, or it feels that it can defeat the other side. One of the major implications of an international system with any number of poles, including a multi polar system, is that international decisions will often be made for strategic reasons to maintain a balance of power rather than out of ideological or historical reasons. The 'Concert of Europe,' a period from after the Napoleonic Wars to the Crimean War, was an example of peaceful multipolarity (the great powers of Europe assembled regularly to discuss international and domestic issues). World War I, World War II, the Thirty Years War, the Warring States period, the Three Kingdoms period and the tripartite division between Song dynasty/Liao dynasty/Jin dynasty/Yuan dynasty are all examples of a wartime multipolarity. Nonpolarity Nonpolarity is an international system which has been postulated by Richard Haass, featuring numerous centers of power but no center dominating any other center. Centers of power can be nation-states, corporations, non-governmental organizations, terrorist groups, and such. Power is found in many hands and many places. It suffers from attempting to use liberal conceptions of power within a realist paradigm, diluting the meaning of 'polarity', and is not widely found in usual discussions of polarity.Grigsby, E. (2012). Analysing Politics. New York: Cengage (5ed). Pp. 255-259.  Devolution  Though usually defined as the decentralization of power within a state, the term devolution, when applied to international relations, describes the process by which economically and militarily emerging states gain greater autonomy in regional affairs but do not achieve global power status. Against the theory that the world is moving from a unipolar order, dominated by the United States, to a multipolar world with various centers of power, Amitai Etzioni argues that, in the foreseeable future, the global redistribution of power is following a different pattern: \\"the change seems to be toward more regional autonomy, or increased devolution, and greater variety in the relationships between the United States and regional powers.\\" This alternative theory has policy implications as \\"the desire for more control among rising powers can be more readily accommodated than aspirations to challenge the United States as a global superpower.\\"  Measuring the power concentration  The Correlates of War uses a systemic concentration of power formula to calculate the polarity of a given great power system. The formula was developed by J. David Singer et al. in 1972. : \\\\text{Concentration}_t = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} (S_{it})^2 - \\\\frac{1}{N_t}}{1 - \\\\frac{1}{N_t}}} :t = the time at which the concentration of resources (i.e. power) is being calculated :i = the state of which the proportion of control over the system's power is being measured :Nt = the number of states in the great power system at time t :S = the proportion of power possessed. Hence, Sit = the proportion of power possessed by state i at time t. The expression \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (S_{it})^2 represents the sum of the squares of the proportion of power possessed by all states in the great power system. The closer the resulting concentration is to zero, the more evenly divided power is. The closer to 1, the more concentrated power is. There is a general but not strict correlation between concentration and polarity. It is rare to find a result over 0.5, but a result between 0.4 and 0.5 usually indicates a unipolar system, while a result between 0.2 and 0.4 usually indicated a bipolar or multipolar system. Concentration can be plotted over time, so that the fluctuations and trends in concentration can be observed.

The second Engage (AM-433/MSO-433) was launched 18 June 1953 by Colberg Boat Works, Stockton, California; sponsored by Mrs. R. B. Richmond; and commissioned 29 June 1954, Lieutenant S. J. Martin in command. She was reclassified MSO-433, 7 February 1955. Originally intended to be USS Elusive it was changed to Engage to avoid potential phonetic conflict with USS Illusive (MSO-448). From her home port at Long Beach, where she first arrived 21 July 1954, Engage operated in mine warfare and general training along the west coast, preparing for her deployments to the Far East in 1955-56, 1958, and 1960. During these, she trained with minecraft of the navies of the Republics of China and the Philippines, and the Royal Thailand navy, since an important duty for minecraft serving in the Far East is to improve the readiness of friendly navies to operate in mutual defense. Engage participated in Operation Market Time (11 March 1965 to December 1972) which was created by joining the US Navy and the South Vietnamese Navy in an effort to stop the flow of supplies from North Vietnam into the south by sea. According to Navy reports, Operation Market Time was very successful, but received little credit. Eventually all the supply routes at sea became non-existent, which forced the North Vietnamese to use the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Engage also participated in Operation End Sweep which began in January 1973. The last provision of the Vietnam war cease-fire agreement that directly related to the Navy entailed removal of the U.S. sea mines laid along the North Vietnamese coast and the Mark 36 Destructors dropped into inland waterways. On 28 January, following months of extensive preparation and training, the Seventh Fleet's Mine Countermeasures Force (Task Force 78), led by Rear Admiral Brian McCauley, sailed from Subic Bay and shaped course for a staging area off Haiphong. On 6 February, one day after Commander Task Force 78 met in the city to coordinate actions with his North Vietnamese opposite, Colonel Hoang Huu Thai, Operation End Sweep got underway. A total of 10 ocean minesweepers, 9 amphibious ships, 6 fleet tugs, 3 salvage ships, and 19 destroyer types served with Task Force 78 during the six months of Operation End Sweep. Engage was decommissioned 30 December 1991 in Mayport, Florida. After decommissioning, Engage (ex MSO-433) remained in the Philadelphia inactive ships facility until delivered to Baltimore Marine. She was scrapped 17 May 2002.

He proposes a carbon-oriented agricultural revolution that could double world food supplies while simultaneously building soil fertility and lowering atmospheric and oceanic concentrations of carbon. Bates suggests that, if sourced cautiously, biochar energy systems could eliminate fossil fuel dependency, bring new life to desertified landscapes, purify drinking water, and build carbon-negative homes, communities and economies.

Bates emphasizes that the only way to stem the present onslaught of a material that endures forever is to enforce mandatory economic and industrial changes so that recycled, biosourced, and biodegradable plastic become more cost-effective than plastic made from fossil fuels. He explores current worldwide efforts for stronger regulations and better waste management, along with exciting new biological and man-made technologies for improved plastics collection and disposal. In A Side Door Introduction to The Farm, Bates brings together the observations of authors, reporters and casual observers over the first 50 years of his ecovillage's history, some positive but many critical. This short anthology contains many surprising insights into the mechanics of crafting a holistic, utopian vision and then trying to bring it into the world.

Malpass was born to be an artist, and his relentless pursuit, together with his belief in the process of working and making art in virtually every moment, can only explain how a young artist could create such a large body of fine work in such a short time. It compels us to wonder if Michael Malpass sensed the limitation of his time. Malpass experimented with multiple visual media to find his way as an artist, leaving behind an expansive record of creative development. As he came of age, it was the manipulation of metal shapes, extracted from the earth, manufactured by unknown persons for any number of purposes, and left behind for salvage, that caught Michael's imagination. Passion for transforming metal shapes into beautiful objects led him to hone welding and traditional blacksmithing techniques required to exert his will over steel, bronze, copper, brass, or any combination of metals that he could find with intent to purge the industrial life out of them. Freed, revitalized, time to become art. Malpass was among the most creative and prolific artists of his generation. In 2018, the book Humdinger was published. Written by his son of the same name, Humdinger is considered to be the definitive record of the artwork and life of the artist. Life Michael Malpass was born on August 18, 1946, in Yonkers, New York. In 1965 he enrolled at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he would ultimately earn his BFA (1969), MFA (1973), and MS (1977). Malpass was drafted and served in the US Army in 1970, where he was a Spec 4 Sergeant stationed in Berlin, and earned a medal of commendation for creating a part welded to the howitzer that extended its firing range. After his military service, he returned to NY and became an Instructor (Welding & Forge, 1972–1975), Assistant Professor (Sculpture, 1975–1980), and Associate Professor (Sculpture, 1980–1987) at Pratt, before deciding in 1987 to concentrate on his sculpture full-time from his home in Brick Township, NJ. Through the remainder of the 1980s, he enjoyed an especially productive period with simultaneous commissions, gallery shows, exhibits, and museum interest. Michael Malpass died at the age of 44 on February 13, 1991 at Brooklyn College, where he was filling in for a friend by teaching a sculpture class. He was survived by his wife, Cathleen Malpass, and four children. Exhibitions Malpass' first exhibition was in 1977, a solo show at The Betty Parsons Gallery in Manhattan. One of his works was among several pieces pictured on the cover of the March 1979 issue of ARTnews magazine that featured Betty Parsons. Several of his spheres were included in the 1997 Pete Hamill book, \\"Tools as Art: The Hechinger Collection.\\" His work has been extensively exhibited. Particularly notable was the Michael Malpass Retrospective ant Monmouth University's Pollak Gallery in 2016. In addition to a large body of installations and commissions, his work can be found in museums and public and private collections around the world. Cathleen Malpass represents the work of her late husband through the Cathleen Malpass Gallery, that she constructed in his former studio space in Brick Township, NJ Sculpture Michael Malpass produced hundreds of sculptures that both challenged and adhered to classical aesthetic standards. Malpass focused much of his effort on creating spherical shapes, primarily using found metal objects. He would often say, “The sphere is the most perfect form. The sphere is whole. The form is simple, yet the surface is complicated. The structure is animated, yet peaceful.” He worked with other forms as well, including one departure that morphed into an important and comprehensive body of work he dubbed \\"chicken men.\\" The chicken men were reviewed in ARTnews in May 1984, and were often exhibited along with the spheres. Believing as he did in the process of creating, Malpass also left a body of sculptural works that cannot be categorized as spheres nor chicken men, yet were created with the same exquisite technique and emotional content that Malpass employed in creating all of his artwork.

In it, a circle and its center are given. The challenge is to divide the circle into four equal arcs using only a compass.Folens MATHS Programme Year 9, 3. Mascheroni constructions, Napoleon's problem, p. 72–73 Projekt Director: Mary Pardoe, 2003 by Folens Limited, Retrieved 2018-06-07Napoleon's problem Napoleon was known to be an amateur mathematician, but it is not known if he either created or solved the problem. Napoleon's friend the Italian mathematician Lorenzo Mascheroni introduced the limitation of using only a compass (no straight edge) into geometric constructions. But actually, the challenge above is easier than the real Napoleon's problem, consisting in finding the center of a given circle with compass alone. The following sections will describe solutions to three problems and proofs that they work. Georg Mohr's 1672 book \\"Euclides Danicus\\" anticipated Mascheroni's idea, though the book was only rediscovered in 1928.  Dividing a given circle into four equal arcs given its centre  200px Centred on any point X on circle C, draw an arc through O (the centre of C) which intersects C at points V and Y. Do the same centred on Y through O, intersecting C at X and Z. Note that the line segments OV, OX, OY, OZ, VX, XY, YZ have the same length, all distances being equal to the radius of the circle C. Now draw an arc centred on V which goes through Y and an arc centred on Z which goes through X; call where these two arcs intersect T. Note that the distances VY and XZ are \\\\sqrt{3} times the radius of the circle C. Put the compass radius equal to the distance OT (\\\\sqrt{2} times the radius of the circle C) and draw an arc centred on Z which intersects the circle C at U and W. UVWZ is a square and the arcs of C UV, VW, WZ, and ZU are each equal to a quarter of the circumference of C. Finding the centre of a given circle  right Let (C) be the circle, whose centre is to be found. Let A be a point on (C). A circle (C1) centered at A meets (C) at B and B'. Two circles (C2) centered at B and B', with radius AB, cross again at point C. A circle (C3) centered at C with radius AC meets (C1) at D and D'. Two circles (C4) centered at D and D' with radius AD meet at A, and at O, the sought center of (C). Note: for this to work the radius of circle (C1) must be neither too small nor too large. More precisely, this radius must be between half and double of the radius of (C): if the radius is greater than the diameter of (C), (C1) will not intersect (C); if the radius is shorter than half the radius of (C), point C will be between A and O and (C3) will not intersect (C). = Proof = 250px The idea behind the proof is to construct, with compass alone, the length b²/a when lengths a and b are known, and a/2 ≤ b ≤ 2a. In the figure on the right, a circle of radius a is drawn, centred at O; on it a point A is chosen, from which points B and B' can be determined such that AB and AB' have a length of b. Point A' lies opposite A, but does not need to be constructed (it would require a straightedge); similarly point H is the (virtual) intersection of AA' and BB'. Point C can be determined from B and B', using circles of radius b. Triangle ABA' has a right angle at B and BH is perpendicular to AA', so : : \\\\frac{AH}{AB} = \\\\frac{AB}{AA'} Therefore, AH = \\\\frac{b^2}{2a} and AC = b²/a. In the above construction of the center, such a configuration appears twice : * points A, B and B' are on the circle (C), radius a = r ; AB, AB', BC, and B'C are equal to b = R, so AC = \\\\frac{R^2}{r}; * points A, D and D' are on the circle of centre C, radius a_2 = \\\\frac{R^2}{r} ; DA, D'A, DO, and D'O are equal to b = R, so AO = \\\\frac{R^2}{R^2/r}= r. Therefore, O is the centre of circle (C).  Finding the middle of a given distance or of a line segment  Construction the middle of a distance or of a line segment only with a compass, animation see here. Let AD be the distance, whose centre is to be found. Two circles (C1) centered at A and (C2) centered at D with radius AD meet at B and B'. A circle (C3) centered at B' with radius B'B meets the circle (C2) at A'. A circle (C4) centered at A' with radius A'A meets the circle (C1) at E and E'. Two circles (C5) centered at E and (C6) centered at E' with radius EA meet at A and O. O is the sought center of AD. *The design principle can also be applied to a line segment . *The proof described above is also applicable for this design. :Note: Point A in design is equivalent to A in proof. :Therefore radius: (C2) ≙ (C) and points: O ≙ H, B ≙ B, D ≙ O and A' ≙ A'.

The supercritical water reactor (SCWR) is a concept Generation IV reactor,https://www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_40679/technology-system-scwr accessdate=7 Apr 2016 mostly designed as light water reactor (LWR) that operates at supercritical pressure (i.e. greater than 22.1 MPa). The term critical in this context refers to the critical point of water, and must not be confused with the concept of criticality of the nuclear reactor. The water heated in the reactor core becomes a supercritical fluid above the critical temperature of 374 °C, transitioning from a fluid more resembling liquid water to a fluid more resembling saturated steam (which can be used in a steam turbine), without going through the distinct phase transition of boiling. In contrast, the well-established pressurized water reactors (PWR) have a primary cooling loop of liquid water at a subcritical pressure, transporting heat from the reactor core to a secondary cooling loop, where the steam for driving the turbines is produced in a boiler (called the steam generator). Boiling water reactors (BWR) operate at even lower pressures, with the boiling process to generate the steam happening in the reactor core. The supercritical steam generator is a proven technology. The development of SCWR systems is considered a promising advancement for nuclear power plants because of its high thermal efficiency (~45 % vs. ~33 % for current LWRs) and simpler design. As of 2012 the concept was being investigated by 32 organizations in 13 countries.  History  The super-heated steam cooled reactors operating at subcritical-pressure were experimented with in both Soviet Union and in the United States as early as the 1950s and 1960s such as Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station, Pathfinder and Bonus of GE's Operation Sunrise program. These are not SCWRs. SCWRs were developed from the 1990s onwards. Both a LWR-type SCWR with a reactor pressure vessel and a CANDU-type SCWR with pressure tubes are being developed. A 2010 book includes conceptual design and analysis methods such as core design, plant system, plant dynamics and control, plant startup and stability, safety, fast reactor design etc. A 2013 document saw the completion of a prototypical fueled loop test in 2015.https://www.gen-4.org/gif/upload/docs/application/pdf/2013-09/gif_rd_outlook_for_generation_iv_nuclear_energy_systems.pdf A Fuel Qualification Test was completed in 2014. A 2014 book saw reactor conceptual design of a thermal spectrum reactor (Super LWR) and a fast reactor (Super FR) and experimental results of thermal hydraulics, materials and material-coolant interactions. Design = Moderator-coolant = The SCWR operates at supercritical pressure. The reactor outlet coolant is supercritical water. Light water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant. Above the critical point, steam and liquid become the same density and are indistinguishable, eliminating the need for pressurizers and steam generators (PWR), or jet/recirculation pumps, steam separators and dryers (BWR). Also by avoiding boiling, SCWR does not generate chaotic voids (bubbles) with less density and moderating effect. In a LWR this can affect heat transfer and water flow, and the feedback can make the reactor power harder to predict and control. Neutronic and thermal hydraulic coupled calculation is needed to predict the power distribution. SCWR's simplification should reduce construction costs and improve reliability and safety. A LWR type SCWR adopts water rods with thermal insulation and A CANDU type SCWR keeps water moderator in a Calandria tank. A fast reactor core of the LWR type SCWR adopts tight fuel rod lattice as a high conversion LWR. The fast neutron spectrum SCWR has advantages of a higher power density, but needs plutonium and uranium mixed oxides fuel which will be available from reprocessing. = Control = SCWRs would likely have control rods inserted through the top, as is done in PWRs. = Material = The conditions inside an SCWR are harsher than those in LWRs, LMFBRs, and supercritical fossil fuel plants (with which much experience has been gained, though this does not include the combination of harsh environment and intense neutron radiation). SCWRs need a higher standard of core materials (especially fuel cladding) than either of these. R&D; focuses on: * The chemistry of supercritical water under radiation (preventing stress corrosion cracking, and maintaining corrosion resistance under neutron radiation and high temperatures) * Dimensional and microstructural stability (preventing embrittlement, retaining strength and creep resistance also under radiation and high temperatures) * Materials that both resist the harsh conditions and do not absorb too many neutrons, which affects fuel economy  Advantages  * Supercritical water has excellent heat transfer properties allowing a high power density, a small core, and a small containment structure. * The use of a supercritical Rankine cycle with its typically higher temperatures improves efficiency (would be ~45 % versus ~33 % of current PWR/BWRs). * This higher efficiency would lead to better fuel economy and a lighter fuel load, lessening residual (decay) heat. * SCWR is typically designed as a direct- cycle, whereby steam or hot supercritical water from the core is used directly in a steam turbine. This makes the design simple. As a BWR is simpler than a PWR, a SCWR is a lot simpler and more compact than a less-efficient BWR having the same electrical output. There are no steam separators, steam dryers, internal recirculation pumps, or recirculation flow inside the pressure vessel. The design is a once-through, direct-cycle, the simplest type of cycle possible. The stored thermal and radiologic energy in the smaller core and its (primary) cooling circuit would also be less than that of either a BWR's or a PWR's. * Water is liquid at room temperature, cheap, non-toxic and transparent, simplifying inspection and repair (compared to liquid metal cooled reactors). * A fast SCWR could be a breeder reactor, like the proposed Clean And Environmentally Safe Advanced Reactor, and could burn the long-lived actinide isotopes. * A heavy-water SCWR could breed fuel from thorium (4x more abundant than uranium), with increased proliferation resistance over plutonium breeders.  Disadvantages  * Lower water inventory (due to compact primary loop) means less heat capacity to buffer transients and accidents (e.g. loss of feedwater flow or large break loss-of-coolant accident) resulting in accident and transient temperatures that are too high for conventional metallic cladding. However, Safety analysis of LWR type SCWR showed that safety criteria are met at accidents and abnormal transients including total loss of flow and loss of coolant accident. No double ended break occurs because of the once-through coolant cycle. Core is cooled by the induced flow at the loss of coolant accident. * Higher pressure combined with higher temperature and also a higher temperature rise across the core (compared to PWR/BWRs) result in increased mechanical and thermal stresses on vessel materials that are difficult to solve. A LWR type design, reactor pressure vessel inner wall is cooled by the inlet coolant as a PWR. Outlet coolant nozzles are equipped with thermal sleeves. A pressure-tube design, where the core is divided up into smaller tubes for each fuel channel, has potentially fewer issues here, as smaller diameter tubing can be much thinner than massive single pressure vessels, and the tube can be insulated on the inside with inert ceramic insulation so it can operate at low (calandria water) temperature. The coolant greatly reduces its density at the end of the core, resulting in a need to place extra moderator there. A LWR type SCWR design adopts water rods in the fuel assemblies. Most designs of CANDU type SCWR use an internal calandria where part of the feedwater flow is guided through top tubes through the core, that provide the added moderation (feedwater) in that region. This has the added advantage of being able to cool the entire vessel wall with feedwater, but results in a complex and materially demanding (high temperature, high temperature differences, high radiation) internal calandria and plena arrangement. Again a pressure-tube design has potentially fewer issues, as most of the moderator is in the calandria at low temperature and pressure, reducing the coolant density effect on moderation, and the actual pressure tube can be kept cool by the calandria water. * Extensive material development and research on supercritical water chemistry under radiation is needed * Special start-up procedures needed to avoid instability before the water reaches supercritical conditions. Instability is managed by power to coolant flow rate ratio as a BWR. * A fast SCWR needs a relatively complex reactor core to have a negative void coefficient. But single coolant flow pass core is feasible.

Starting the 2004 season on the bench, Galloway scored the Sharks' sole try in the opening game of the season, a 6-12 loss to Wests Tigers. He played in 14 games for the season, including some mid-season appearances in the starting side in the second-row. Galloway was on the receiving end of a John Hopoate leaping elbow charge in 2005, leaving the 19-year-old unconscious on the field. The event led to a 17-week suspension for Hopoate. He was again a regular on the bench for the Sharks, but in the qualifying final match against St. George Dragons he was promoted to starting prop, in what was his last game for the club. Galloway playing for Wests in 2009 Galloway in 2010 Wests Tigers =2006-2011= Galloway joined the Wests Tigers in 2006, having signed with them halfway through the 2005 season. He said, \\"I'd played with a few of those boys with schoolboys and junior rep teams. It was a really young squad then. I thought it would probably be a good opportunity to grow with this team.\\" He played 12 games in his first season, mostly off the bench, failing to score a try. In 2006, he spent more time as the starting prop and made 17 appearances. He scored his first try for the club in round 3 against Parramatta. He was named in the Scotland training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. He was selected for City in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009. Before the 2009 State of Origin series Galloway was named in the 40 man New South Wales preliminary squad but was ultimately not available for selection due to injury. Later that year he was named in Australia's Four- Nations train-on squad. He was also picked for the Prime Minister's XIII to play Papua New Guinea, but had to withdraw due to an injury to his left knee. In 2010, he signed a contract to remain at the club until the end of the 2013 season. In 2011, Galloway made his State of Origin début, coming off the bench in game 3 of the series, but had little time on the field. At the end of the season, Galloway became the first Wests Tigers' prop to be chosen in an Australian squad. He said of the selection, \\"I'm super stoked to be there. I was happy with my form this year, I didn't have many injuries and I got through 23 games, which is the most I've played. Consistency-wise it was my best year.\\" Galloway made his test début against New Zealand, coming off the bench to score a try in the second half, in a game won easily by Australia. He later said, \\"I just ran off Billy Slater. I didn't have to run far for the try.\\" He went on to play in all four of Australia's Four Nations matches. He was awarded the Noel Kelly Medal for Best Forward at the Wests Tigers for the year. =2012-15= Injuries hampered Galloway's chances of playing representative football in 2012. He made 18 appearances for the Wests Tigers throughout the season, with the club losing every game that he was unable to play in. A torn pectoral muscle in the round two game saw Galloway miss seventeen weeks of football in 2013, playing just 9 games. In July, he re- signed with the club for another three seasons. Coach Mick Potter said, \\"Keith consistently makes the most metres which gives the team that much needed go forward. He definitely has a presence on the field, being a big man he stops people on contact.\\" Galloway was expected to play for Scotland in the 2013 World Cup, but withdrew with after sustaining a stress facture in his foot in Wests last game for the season. Galloway played in 22 games in 2015, the most appearances he had made in a regular season. In round 7 against the Canberra Raiders, he scored his first try since the middle of 2012. He made 502 tackles for the year and averaged over a hundred meters per game with the ball. In round 25, with Wests Tigers well ahead on the scoreboard and regular time over, Galloway attempted his first conversion, which narrowly missed. Galloway said, \\"I didn't want to do it, but everyone in the team egged me on to do it. Obviously I'm not a goal-kicker. I sort of knew it was my last home game but it probably didn't hit me until we were out there. I've had a great 10 years – I really enjoyed it.\\" Leeds Rhinos On 24 July 2015, Keith signed a three-year contract to play for the Super League heavyweights the Leeds Rhinos beginning in the 2016 season. After travelling to the UK, Galloway said that he intended to represent Scotland in 2016 Four Nations, and would have liked to have played for them in the past if not for injuries. He said, \\"My father came over to Australia when he was in his 20s. I'm Australian but I'm proud of my Scottish ancestry and it would mean a lot to my family and myself if I could pull on that jersey.\\"  Career highlights  *First Grade Debut: 2003 – Round 19, Cronulla v New Zealand Warriors at Toyota Park, Sydney, 19 July. *NSW City Origin Debut: 2009 – NSW City Origin v NSW Country Origin, Wade Park, Orange, New South Wales, 8 May. *NSW City Origin Selection: 2009-2011 *New South Wales Debut: 2011 State of Origin series Game 3, New South Wales v Queensland, Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane, 6 July. *Australia Test Debut: 2011 – Australia v New Zealand, Newcastle International Sports Centre, Newcastle, 16 October. *Australia Test Squad Selection: 2011 * Super League Champion 2017 References  External links  *Leeds Rhinos profile *(archived by web.archive.org) Leeds profile 1985 births Australian people of Scottish descent Australia national rugby league team players Wests Tigers players Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks players Leeds Rhinos players New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players Prime Minister's XIII players Rugby league props Rugby league players from Sydney Living people ","title":"Keith Galloway"},{"id":"2941202","text":"Cameron Ciraldo (born 30 October 1984) is a professional rugby league coach and former player who is the head coach of the Italian national team and an assistant coach of the Penrith Panthers in the National Rugby League.

The company was a major supplier of steam shovels for the construction of the Panama Canal. The company also built the two crawler-transporters used by NASA for transporting the Saturn V rocket and later the Space Shuttle to their launch pads. The company's shovels played a major role in excavation for Hoover Dam, the Holland Tunnel and the extension of the Number 7 subway line to Main Street in Flushing, Queens.Olberhelman, Olberhelman, and Lampe. Quail Lakes & Coal: Energy for Wildlife ... and the World, 2013, page 60 Contractors & Engineers Magazine, Volume 10, 1925, page 80 Founded in Marion, Ohio in August, 1884 by Henry Barnhart, Edward Huber and George W. King as the Marion Steam Shovel Company, the company grew through sales and acquisitions throughout the 20th century. The company changed its name to Marion Power Shovel Company in 1946 to reflect the industry's change from steam power to diesel power. The company ceased to be independent when it was sold, becoming the Marion division of Dresser Industries in 1977. In 1992 Dresser spun off the Marion division and certain other assets into a holding company that eventually became the Global Industrial Technologies, Inc. Global sold the division to longtime rival Bucyrus International for US$40.1 million in 1997. Bucyrus integrated the Marion division's products into the Bucyrus product line, then closed the Marion, Ohio, facility. History =Marion Steam Shovel Company= The Marion Steam Shovel Company was established by Henry Barnhart, George W. King and Edward Huber in August 1884. While steam shovels had been made prior to this date in the United States, Barnhart persuaded Huber to financially back his design, which incorporated a stronger bucket support than other makes. Barnhart and Huber patented Barnhart's changes under US Patent No. 285,100 on September 18, 1883. One element of Barnhart's design was the use of solid iron rods (hog rings) to support the boom of the shovel, which was stronger than simple chain. Marion Model 91, Culebra Cut, Panama Canal This machine set the record in July 1908 for moving of earth in 25 eight-hour days after American project management began. Marion built large and small steam shovels for building contractors, railroads and the US Army Corps of Engineers who were building the Panama Canal at the time. The company, from between 1902 and 1911, shipped 112 shovels to Panama for the construction of the canal.Koblentz, Stuart J. Marion Historical Society. Marion County Arcadia Publishing, 2007. A Marion Model 91, the type used at the Panama Canal, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Marion was most successful with the Model 20 series contractors shovels (see steam shovel). During the project Marion Shovels broke world records in amount of earth moved within a given time frame (1908) and greatest amount (8-ton) lifted by a single bucket (1911). The Type 22 and Type 28 Marion shovels were the most popular. They were the fully revolving, wheel or track contractors shovel. Around 800 were built from 1905 to 1930. Marion also built floating dredges for land reclamation projects and the Klondike Gold dredges in Dawson City. Trenching shovels, stripping shovels, railroad shovels and draglines were also built. Large shovels were built for the Ohio open pit coalfields. By the late 1930s diesel engines replaced steam. Marion excavators were used during construction of Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union in 1930s. Marion was the first fоreign machine there, in 1930. Poet Boris Ruchyov wrote the \\"Ballad of Excavator Marion\\" [Баллада об экскаваторе Марион] on this occasion.Камынин, \\"Отношение к иностранной помощи СССР в годы первой пятилетки\\", История и современное мировоззрение, 2019, no. 1 By 1911 90% of all large bucket steam shovels and draglines were produced in Marion Ohio, which was also the headquarters of Osgood Steam Shovel, Fairbanks Steam Shovel and General Excavating Corporation. (Competitor Bucyrus Steam Shovel was founded from Marion in nearby Bucyrus, Ohio. The company soon relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin after Bucyrus city officials refused to approve expansion plans for the company.) Marion 111-M Dragline in action. (30 seconds) Towards the end of WWI the company assembled M1918 railway guns utilizing a repurposed M1895 12 inch 45 caliber coastal defense gun. The only remaining example was stored for testing purposes at Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren VA until 2011 when it was moved to Fort Lee, VA for inclusion in the U.S. Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center. =Marion Power Shovel= In April 1946, the company changed its name to the Marion Power Shovel Company to more closely reflect its products. Marion built its first walking dragline in 1939 and became a key player in providing giant stripping shovels to the coal industry, being the first to put a long-boom revolving stripping shovel to work in North America in 1911. Marion’s succession of giant shovels, many breaking world size records, starting with The Mountaineer in 1956 which was 16 stories. One shovel load moved approximately 90 tons, which was then one of the world's largest power shovels.\\"16 Tone Mobile Shovel Take 90 Ton Bite of Earth\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1956, p. 95. -via books.google.com Marion's huge power shovel models eventually culminated in the world’s largest: the 1965 Marion 6360. The 6360 at the Captain Mine, Illinois, operated with a 180 cubic yard (138 cubic meter) dipper. With an estimated weight of 15,000 tons (13,600 tonnes), this machine is one of the heaviest mobile land machines ever built. One of two crawler-transporters built by Marion and used by NASA for transporting rockets Marion designed and built the NASA Crawler-transporter used to transport both the Saturn V rocket, as well as the Space Shuttle. =Osgood Company acquisition= In 1955, Marion Power Shovel acquired its crosstown rival, the Osgood Company, which manufactured shovels under the Marion-Osgood and Osgood names. Osgood's product line complemented Marion Power Shovel's, with most of Osgood's product line focusing on shovels, cranes and draglines that were small capacity machines as opposed to Marion's line, which focused increasingly on high end strip mining draglines. Osgood also built road-ready mobile units that used Mack truck undercarriages. Acquisition and end This Marion Model 91 shovel on display in Le Roy, New York is the only example known to exist. This shovel is included on the National Register of Historic Places. The Marion Power Shovel Company was refinanced by management in the late 1960s with only the signature guarantee of the primary stockholder, billionaire Henry Hillman, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and PNC Bank fame. In 1977 Dresser Industries, Inc. purchased Marion Power Shovel for approximately US$250 million. The company grew from 1,500 employees in 1974 to over 3,200 employees by 1978 under the direction of Putt McDowell during the massive growth in coal mining demand of the late 1970s. By 1992, Dresser Industries decided to exit the production of industrial and mining equipment. The affected assets, including the Marion division, became part of Indresco, a holding company created by Dresser in 1992 and then spun off to Dresser shareholders. On November 1, 1995, Indresco changed its name to Global Industrial Technologies, Inc. On January 23, 1997 Global Industrial Technologies announced that it was divesting certain assets, including the Marion division. Global Industrial Technologies sold the Marion Power Shovel Company, which had revenues of US$114.4 million in FY 1996, for US$40.1 million to Bucyrus International, Inc. on July 23, 1997. Following the acquisition, Bucyrus International closed Marion Power Shovel Company's Marion, Ohio facility. Historical corporate files and archives for Marion Power Shovel were split between Bowling Green, Ohio's Historical Construction Equipment Association and the Marion County Historical Society in Marion, Ohio.

History After the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, the county belonged to Romania, which set up the county formally in 1925. After the 1938 Administrative and Constitutional Reform, this county merged with the counties of Tighina, Cetatea Albă and Orhei to form Ținutul Nistru. The area county of the county was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became part of the Moldavian SSR. The area returned to Romanian administration following the Axis Powers' invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. A military administration was established and the region's Jewish population was either executed on the spot or deported to Transnistria, where further numbers were killed. As the Soviet Union's offensive pushed the Axis powers back, the area again was under Soviet control. On September 12, 1944, Romania signed the Moscow Armistice with the Allies.

He worked on a story called \\"A Gamble with Time\\", also for the seventeenth season, but owing to the divorce proceedings ending his first marriage, he was unable to finish the scripts. That story was reworked and completed by Douglas Adams and then-producer Graham Williams, and was recorded and broadcast as City of Death (1979) under the pseudonym of David Agnew. His final Doctor Who story was season eighteen's The Leisure Hive (1980).

The normal range for blood concentration is 20 to 50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).  Signs and symptoms  An excess of vitamin D causes abnormally high blood concentrations of calcium, which can cause overcalcification of the bones, soft tissues, heart and kidneys. In addition, hypertension can result. Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity may include the following: * Dehydration * Vomiting * Diarrhea * Decreased appetite * Irritability * Constipation * Fatigue * Muscle weakness *Metastatic calcification of the soft tissues Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity appear several months after excessive doses of vitamin D are administered. In almost every case, a low-calcium diet combined with corticosteroid drugs will allow for a full recovery within a month. It is possible that some of the symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are actually due to vitamin K depletion. One animal experiment has demonstrated that co-consumption with vitamin K reduced adverse effects, but this has not been tested in humans. However the interconnected relationships between vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K, outlined in a 2007 paperhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17145139/ published in the journal Medical Hypotheses, describes potential feedback loops between these three vitamins that could be elucidated by future research. A mutation of the CYP24A1 gene can lead to a reduction in the degradation of vitamin D and to hypercalcaemia (see Vitamin_D: Excess). Recommended supplement limits The U.S National Academy of Medicine has established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) to protect against vitamin D toxicity (\\"The UL is not intended as a target intake; rather, the risk for harm begins to increase once intakes surpass this level.\\"). These levels in microgram (mcg or µg) and International Units (IU) for both males and females, by age, are: (Conversion : 1 µg = 40 IU and 0.025 µg = 1 IU.) * 0–6 months: 25 µg (1000 IU) * 7–12 months: 38 µg (1500 IU) * 1–3 years: 63 µg (2500 IU) * 4–8 years:75 µg (3000 IU) * 9+ years:100 µg (4000 IU) * Pregnant and Lactating: 100 µg (4000 IU) The recommended dietary allowance is 15 µg/d (600 IU per day; 800 IU for those over 70 years). Overdose has been observed at 1,925 µg/d (77,000 IU per day). Acute overdose requires between 15,000 µg/d (600,000 IU per day) and 42,000 µg/d (1,680,000 IU per day) over a period of several days to months. =Suggested tolerable upper intake level= Based on risk assessment, a safe upper intake level of 250 µg (10,000 IU) per day in healthy adults has been suggested by non-government authors. The harm from vitamin D3 in larger doses is demonstrated in that very high doses are sometimes used as a rodenticide, where it causes hypercalcemia leading to death, typically only after several days following the high dose. Long-term effects of supplementary oral intake Excessive exposure to sunlight poses no risk in vitamin D toxicity through overproduction of vitamin D precursor, cholecalciferol, regulating vitamin D production. During ultraviolet exposure, the concentration of vitamin D precursors produced in the skin reach an equilibrium, and any further vitamin D that is produced is degraded. This process is less efficient with increased melanin pigmentation in the skin. Endogenous production with full body exposure to sunlight is comparable to taking an oral dose between 250 µg and 625 µg (10,000 IU and 25,000 IU) per day.[Effects Of Vitamin D and the Natural selection of skin colour:how much vitamin D nutrition are we talking about http://www.direct- ms.org/pdf/VitDVieth/Vieth%20Anthropology%20vit%20D.pdf] Vitamin D oral supplementation and skin synthesis have a different effect on the transport form of vitamin D, plasma calcifediol concentrations. Endogenously synthesized vitamin D3 travels mainly with vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), which slows hepatic delivery of vitamin D and the availability in the plasma. In contrast, orally administered vitamin D produces rapid hepatic delivery of vitamin D and increases plasma calcifediol. It has been questioned whether to ascribe a state of sub-optimal vitamin D status when the annual variation in ultraviolet will naturally produce a period of falling levels, and such a seasonal decline has been a part of Europeans' adaptive environment for 1000 generations. Still more contentious is recommending supplementation when those supposedly in need of it are labeled healthy and serious doubts exist as to the long-term effect of attaining and maintaining serum 25(OH)D of at least 80nmol/L by supplementation. Current theories of the mechanism behind vitamin D toxicity (starting at a plasmatic concentration of ≈750 nmol/L) propose that: * Intake of vitamin D raises calcitriol concentrations in the plasma and cell * Intake of vitamin D raises plasma calcifediol concentrations which exceed the binding capacity of the DBP, and free calcifediol enters the cell * Intake of vitamin D raises the concentration of vitamin D metabolites which exceed DBP binding capacity and free calcitriol enters the cell All of these affect gene transcription and overwhelm the vitamin D signal transduction process, leading to vitamin D toxicity. = Cardiovascular disease = Evidence suggests that dietary vitamin D may be carried by lipoprotein particles into cells of the artery wall and atherosclerotic plaque, where it may be converted to active form by monocyte-macrophages. This raises questions regarding the effects of vitamin D intake on atherosclerotic calcification and cardiovascular risk as it may be causing vascular calcification. Calcifediol is implicated in the etiology of atherosclerosis, especially in non-Caucasians. The levels of the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, are inversely correlated with coronary calcification. Moreover, the active vitamin D analog, alfacalcidol, seems to protect patients from developing vascular calcification. Serum vitamin D has been found to correlate with calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African Americans as they have higher active serum vitamin D levels compared to Euro- Americans. Higher levels of calcidiol positively correlate with aorta and carotid calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African Americans but not with coronary plaque, whereas individuals of European descent have an opposite, negative association. There are racial differences in the association of coronary calcified plaque in that there is less calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries of African-Americans than in whites. Among descent groups with heavy sun exposure during their evolution, taking supplemental vitamin D to attain the 25(OH)D level associated with optimal health in studies done with mainly European populations may have deleterious outcomes. Despite abundant sunshine in India, vitamin D status in Indians are low and suggests a public health need to fortify Indian foods with vitamin D. However, the levels found in India are consistent with many other studies of tropical populations which have found that even an extreme amount of sun exposure, does not raise 25(OH)D levels to the levels typically found in Europeans. Recommendations stemming for a single standard for optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations ignores the differing genetically mediated determinates of serum 25(OH)D and may result in ethnic minorities in Western countries having the results of studies done with subjects not representative of ethnic diversity applied to them. Vitamin D levels vary for genetically mediated reasons as well as environmental ones. =Ethnic differences= Possible ethnic differences in physiological pathways for ingested vitamin D, such as the Inuit, may confound across the board recommendations for vitamin D levels. Inuit compensate for lower production of vitamin D by converting more of this vitamin to its most active form. A Toronto study of young Canadians of diverse ancestry applied a standard of serum 25(OH)D levels that was significantly higher than official recommendations.Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (2007) Update on Vitamin D Position Statement by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition 2007 These levels were described to be 75 nmol/L as \\"optimal\\", between 75 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L as \\"insufficient\\" and < 50 nmol/L as \\"deficient\\". 22% of individuals of European ancestry had 25(OH)D levels less than the 40 nmol/L cutoff, comparable to the values observed in previous studies (40nmol/L is 15 ng/mL). 78% of individuals of East Asian ancestry and 77% of individuals of South Asian ancestry had 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 40 nmol/L. The East Asians in the Toronto sample had low 25(OH)D levels when compared to whites. In a Chinese population at particular risk for esophageal cancer and with the high serum 25(OH)D concentrations have a significantly increased risk of the precursor lesion. Studies on the South Asian population uniformly point to low 25(OH)D levels, despite abundant sunshine. Rural men around Delhi average 44 nmol/L. Healthy Indians seem have low 25(OH)D levels which are not very different from healthy South Asians living in Canada. Measuring melanin content to assess skin pigmentation showed an inverse relationship with serum 25(OH)D. The uniform occurrence of very low serum 25(OH)D in Indians living in India and Chinese in China does not support the hypothesis that the low levels seen in the more pigmented are due to lack of synthesis from the sun at higher latitudes. =Premature aging= Complex regulatory mechanisms control metabolism. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that there is a narrow range of vitamin D levels in which vascular function is optimized. Levels above or below this range increased mortality. Animal research suggests that both excess and deficiency of vitamin D appears to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging.

It succeeded the Barber quarter, which had been minted since 1892. Featuring the goddess of Liberty on one side and an eagle in flight on the other, the coin was designed by American sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil. In 1915, Director of the Mint Robert W. Woolley began steps to replace the Barber dime, quarter, and half dollar, as he mistakenly believed that the law required new designs. MacNeil submitted a militaristic design that showed Liberty on guard against attacks. The Mint required modifications to the initial design, and MacNeil's revised version included dolphins to represent the oceans. In late 1916, Mint officials made major changes to the design without consulting MacNeil. The sculptor complained about the changes after receiving the new issue in January 1917. The Mint obtained special legislation to allow MacNeil to redesign the coin as he desired. One change made by the sculptor was the addition of a chain mail vest that covered Liberty's formerly bare breast. In circulation, the coin's date wore away quickly, and Mint engravers modified the design in 1925 to address the issue. The Standing Liberty quarter was discontinued in 1931, a year in which no quarters were struck. By Congressional act the Washington quarter, featuring the first president's profile, was introduced in 1932 to celebrate the bicentennial of his birth.  Inception  On September 26, 1890, the United States Congress passed an act providing: The Barber coinage had been introduced in 1892; dimes, quarter dollars, and half dollars with similar designs by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The Barber coinage, after its release, attracted considerable public dissatisfaction. Beginning in 1905, successive presidential administrations had attempted to bring modern, beautiful designs to United States coins. Following the redesign of the double eagle, eagle, half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908, as well as the cent and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively, advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins' minimum term expired in 1916. As early as 1914, Victor David Brenner, designer of the Lincoln cent, submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins. He was told, in response, that Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters. On January 2, 1915, an interview with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce appeared in the Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record: Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce decried the Lincoln cent and other new coinage, believing that they struck badly. Plaquette by George T. Morgan. In January 1915, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William P. Malburn sent McAdoo a memorandum about the silver subsidiary coinage, noting that \\"the present silver half dollar, quarter, and dime were changed in 1892, and a new design may, therefore, be adopted in 1916. This can be done any time in the year.\\" In reply, McAdoo wrote \\"[l]et the mint submit designs before we try anyone else.\\" on the memorandum. In April 1915, Robert W. Woolley took office as Mint Director. On April 14, he asked Superintendent Joyce to request Chief Engraver Barber, then in his 36th year in office, to prepare new designs. The same day, Malburn requested the opinion of the Treasury Department's Solicitor concerning the Mint view that it could strike new designs for the three denominations in 1916. On April 17, the Solicitor's Office responded that the Mint could change the designs. At the time, the Mint was intensely busy producing the Panama- Pacific commemorative coin issue, and immediate action was not taken. In October, Barber was summoned to Washington to discuss coin designs with Woolley, though it is uncertain whether or not he had already prepared sketches for the new coinage. On December 3, Woolley met with the Commission of Fine Arts. Woolley asked the Commission to view sketches produced by the Mint's engraving department. Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members. Woolley suggested to the members that if they did not like the Mint's work, they should select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces. It was Woolley's intent to have distinct designs for the dime, quarter and half dollar—previously, the three pieces had been nearly identical. The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years, it would have to be changed—something which numismatic historian David Lange calls a \\"misinterpretation of the coinage laws\\". The Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint (submitted by Barber) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins. The sculptors could submit multiple sketches. Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor, the designs were not fully interchangeable—by statute, an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime. Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece. Mint Director Robert W. Woolley (seen on his Mint medal, designed by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan) advocated for the end of the Barber coinage, though he may not have understood he did not have to replace them. The three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid-February, and on February 23 met with Woolley in New York so the artists could make presentations of the work to him and answer his questions. After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on February 28 that five of his sketches had been selected—for the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter's obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter, subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley. On March 3, the new coins were publicly announced, with the Treasury noting, \\"[d]esigns of these coins must be changed by law every 25 years and the present 25 year period ends with 1916.\\" The press release indicated that the Treasury hoped production of the new coins would begin in about two months, once the designs were finalized. The same day, Woolley wrote to Mint Engraver Barber, telling him that his sketches were rejected, and that models from Weinman and MacNeil would arrive at the Philadelphia Mint no later than May 1. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Barber became \\"sullen and totally uncooperative\\". Lange notes that \\"numerous delays were encountered as the artists fine-tuned their models while simultaneously avoiding obstacles thrown in their path by Barber. While his observations regarding many aspects of practical coinage were quite accurate, they clearly could have been presented in a more constructive manner.\\" In his book on Mercury dimes, Lange notes that Barber, by then aged 75, had been \\"compelled over the past ten years to participate in the systematic undoing of a lifetime's achievements\\"; he had to participate in the process which resulted in coins designed by others replacing ones designed by him. With the new pieces, all American coins would have had a recent change of design (the Morgan dollar was not then being struck). According to a column in The Art World magazine later in 1916,  Design  Doris Doscher, billed as \\"The Girl on the Quarter\\" The identity of the model for the obverse of the quarter is uncertain. As early as May 1917, the model for the depiction of Liberty was reported to be Doris Doscher, who would later become a silent film actress under the name Doris Doree. This was accepted for many years. Doscher became well known as \\"the girl on the quarter\\"; she died in 1970 at age 88. In 1972, a quarter-century after MacNeil's death, newspapers reported that the actual model was Broadway actress Irene MacDowell, then aged 92 (she died the following year) whose name was said to have been concealed because her husband (one of MacNeil's tennis partners) disapproved. In an article in the December 2003 edition of The Numismatist, Timothy B. Benford Jr., suggests that the supposed deception was to fool MacNeil's wife, who saw MacDowell as a potential romantic rival. In 1982, Doscher's widower stated that despite the MacDowell claim, his wife had posed for the quarter. MacNeil submitted two designs for the obverse, the one which was successful and another, showing a standing Liberty facing right, which he would later resubmit in modified form in the Peace dollar design competition of 1921, again unsuccessfully. In the rejected design, MacNeil's Liberty leans forward, an olive branch extended in her left hand, but her right hand holding the hilt of a broadsword. According to Burdette, the design was intended to send a message to the belligerents in World War I that America wanted peace, but was ready to fight. MacNeil's accepted obverse is only slightly less militaristic; his Liberty faces to the viewer's right (heraldic east) in the direction of the European war, and her shield faces in that direction as well. She holds an olive branch as she strides through a gate in a wall which is inscribed, \\"In God We Trust\\", with the \\"U\\" in \\"Trust\\" shaped as a V. MacNeil stated that the obverse depicted Liberty \\"stepping forward in ... the defense of peace as her ultimate goal\\". According to art historian Cornelius Vermeule, \\"Liberty is presented as the Athena of the Parthenon pediments, a powerful woman striding forward\\" and states that, but for the Stars and Stripes on her shield, \\"everything else about this Amazon calls to mind Greek sculpture of the period between Pheidias to Praxiteles, 450 to 350 BC.\\" Vermeule suggested that the flying eagle on the reverse is simply that of the 1836 Gobrecht dollar, seen flying from left to right instead of the opposite way, as on the earlier piece. He applauded the 1917 change to the reverse, feeling that it made it less cluttered. Vermeule noted that the reverse marked the beginning of the end (at least for that era) for naturalistic depictions of eagles on US coins, stating in 1970 that those after 1921 tended to present a heraldic appearance instead.  Preparation  Hermon Atkins MacNeil In a letter to Woolley, MacNeil had promised to \\"try and produce something that shall be of use to you\\". The sculptor had been awarded the reverse of the quarter only provisionally, and he prepared a series of studies for the reverse to show Woolley when he visited his studio in College Point, New York. At that time, Woolley selected a reverse similar to that eventually coined, showing an eagle in flight, wings extended and shown almost in full. Other designs which were shown to Woolley included similar eagle designs, but from different angles. The Mint's original schedule called for the designers of the three new coins to complete their models by April 15, 1916. This would allow production of the new pieces to begin about July 1. However, the Mint quickly revised the submission deadline to May 1; this proved optimistic as MacNeil did not submit his models, in the form of bronze casts, until May 18. Even so, he was faster than Weinman, who did not ship the last of his casts to the Mint until June 6. Woolley formally approved the designs for the quarter by letter dated May 23, 1916. Despite the delays, the Mint attempted to meet the July 1 start date. On June 21, Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce, No records of Woolley's objections to the quarter's obverse are known to exist, but numismatic author Roger Burdette suggests that his major concern was that when experimental pattern coins were struck in June, the obverse was indistinct, making even brand new coins appear worn. MacNeil was given permission to do further work on his design by Woolley in late June, and in mid-August turned in a revised obverse different in detail from the original. \\"In God We Trust\\" was displayed on the sash which Liberty holds, a complex chain motif surrounded the design, and two dolphins, emblematic of the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, lay at Liberty's feet. Liberty's shield bore an eagle, rather than the Stars and Stripes. Treasury Secretary McAdoo immediately approved the design changes, acting on August 19. Mint Director Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken. There were problems with the Standing Liberty quarter throughout his six-month tenure as Mint Director. Seen on his Mint medal designed by George T. Morgan. On July 18, Woolley wrote to a numismatic enquirer that the new quarters would begin to be struck about September 1. By the time of that letter, he had resigned as Mint Director to become head of publicity for President Wilson's reelection campaign; Fred H. Chaffin became acting director. On August 18, Wilson nominated Woolley's successor, Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, who was promptly confirmed by the Senate. Von Engelken was supposed to be sworn in on the 21st; his swearing in was delayed until September 1 by President Wilson's failure to sign his commission. One of von Engelken's first acts as Mint Director was to inform MacNeil of McAdoo's acceptance of the design changes, telling him he could place his monogram (a small \\"M\\") on the coin; it appears on the wall, to the right of the two low steps which Liberty descends. The bronze casts were made by the Medallic Art Company; on September 6, MacNeil wrote to von Engelken that they would shortly be shipped to the Philadelphia Mint. By this time, the Mint had experienced considerable difficulties in initiating production of both the dime and half dollar. In the hope of heading off similar problems with the quarter, Mint officials decided to reexamine MacNeil's designs, and subsequently, to adjust them. A number of pattern coins were struck, and von Engelken decided to abandon the dolphins version. By mid-October, patterns with a modified version of MacNeil's original obverse were being struck. On the reverse, the eagle was lowered in position, and a pair of olive branches framing the eagle was replaced by stars. According to Burdette, by making major changes in the design without consulting the designer, Mint officials had \\"duplicated design versions already rejected by MacNeil, wasted government time, alienated one of the country's best sculptors, and flagrantly bastardized artistic creativity.\\" MacNeil, who had no idea the Mint was changing his designs, requested permission to visit the Mint on October 24 to discuss the conversion of his approved models into actual coins. Chaffin (again briefly acting director in von Engelken's absence) declined to pay for his journey, and MacNeil did not come. According to Burdette, \\"the action saved the government less than $20 in October, but may have cost many times that amount before the revised quarter design was accepted the following year.\\" Von Engelken viewed sample coins about that time. He objected to two leaves of the olive branch on the obverse that lay within the angle of the \\"L\\" in \\"Liberty\\" and asked that they be removed; this was done. The Mint Director then met with Secretary McAdoo to view coins struck from the modified dies. McAdoo felt that the figure of Liberty was indistinct, but von Engelken persuaded him that could not be changed without considerable delay. They did decide that the Mint could make the shield clearer, and approved the design with that instruction. Feeling it was impossible to make the change in time to strike coins in 1916, von Engelken instructed Joyce that beginning in 1917, the figure of Liberty should be sharpened. By the time dies were finally made, the year 1916 was almost over, and only 52,000 quarters were struck. This was done as proof that the Barber design had been replaced in the 25th year, as Mint officials believed was required.  Modification  MacNeil's statue Intellectual Development (detail shown) bears similar garb to Liberty on the Standing Liberty quarter. Throughout late 1916, the Mint was intensely busy first sharpening the design to be used in 1917, and then in large-scale preparation of dies to begin striking the new quarters on a massive scale once the new year began. Small change was in great demand: Mint officials had hoped not to strike any Barber pieces in 1916, but eventually had to do so in large quantities to satisfy the need. Once new quarters were struck, fearing the new pieces would be hoarded (especially the low-mintage 1916 coin), von Engelken instructed that no pieces be released without his order. Small quantities of the new quarters were available, however, to officials and to prominent numismatists. MacNeil, who had not heard from the Mint about his coins since the formal acceptance of his dolphin design, read in the newspaper in early January that the Mint was starting to strike his quarters. He wrote to von Engelken on January 6, enclosing a $5 money order, and was sent 20 of the new pieces. After seeing what the Mint had done to his designs, MacNeil wrote again to von Engelken, criticizing the artistic nature of the changes in such strong terms that the Mint Director continued his embargo on the coins' release. The sculptor pointed out, for example, that the lower position of the eagle made it appear about to land—with its talons in a position only assumed at great heights. Von Engelken feared that should the sculptor's objections become public and not be addressed, the Mint would be exposed to ridicule. MacNeil visited the Philadelphia Mint and its engraving department on January 10. No records of his visit are extant, but von Engelken telephoned from Washington to Philadelphia the same day to ensure that the new quarters did not leave the Mint. Mint Director Raymond T. Baker After receiving MacNeil's letter, von Engelken conferred with sculptor and Commission of Fine Arts member Herbert Adams, and with Commission Chairman Charles Moore. Von Engelken agreed that the design of the quarter could be modified to meet MacNeil's wishes. Although no correspondence is known to exist, it appears that the Mint Director and sculptor spoke by telephone over the next several days, as on January 17, von Engelken sent Secretary McAdoo a letter asking for discretion to allow MacNeil to modify the design. McAdoo summoned MacNeil to Washington for a meeting, and then ordered von Engelken to provide MacNeil with all the facilities and help he would need at the Philadelphia Mint—von Engelken had intended that the redesign take place at the sculptor's expense. On January 17, the Mint released the first Standing Liberty quarters, dated both 1916 and 1917, into circulation. On January 30, 1917, von Engelken instructed Joyce to give MacNeil full facilities, and told the Mint Superintendent, \\"see that Mr. Barber keeps his objections to himself while Mr. MacNeil is there\\". George T. Morgan, who had worked under Barber for the Engraver's entire 37-year tenure, was assigned to assist MacNeil. MacNeil hoped to take what he considered to be the best elements of the two versions of the obverse which had been accepted by the Mint the previous year. The figure of Liberty would be taken from the second version; all other elements would come from the first. No change was to be made to Liberty's bare right breast, but the dolphins would not regain their place. However, Morgan proved unable, given engraving technology at the time, to combine the two obverses, meaning the coin would have to be entirely redone by MacNeil. His new version, completed in mid-February, for the first time covered Liberty's breast, giving her a chain mail shirt. Burdette suggests that this change was not unusual for MacNeil, who was increasingly cladding female figures in garments which covered their breasts, as with his statue Intellectual Development, sculpted around that time, and also reflected the deterioration of the international situation in February 1917, as the United States moved towards war with Germany. The reverse saw modifications to the eagle, which was raised in its position on the coin; three of the thirteen stars on the reverse were placed between the bird and the words \\"Quarter Dollar\\". Also a dot between the words \\"QUARTER DOLLAR\\" and between the words \\"UNITED STATES\\" was removed. The redesign of the obverse has led to an enduring myth that the breast was covered up out of prudishness, or in response to public outcry. Breen stated that \\"through their Society for the Suppression of Vice, the guardians of prudery at once began exerting political pressure on the Treasury Department to revoke authorization for these 'immoral' coins\\". Ron Guth and Jeff Garrett, in their book on US coins by type, aver that the covering up of Liberty was \\"a change never authorized by MacNeil\\". Numismatic historian David Lange concedes that there is no evidence of outcry from the public, but suggests that the decision to change the coin was \\"more likely prompted by objections from the Treasury Department\\". Numismatist Ray Young, in his 1979 article in Coins magazine about the quarter, suggested that the redesign \\"came from the symbolism. If Liberty was going to stand up to her foes, she should do so protected—not 'naked to her enemies.' Thus the war probably had much more to do with the change than any alleged 'public indignation.' \\" Von Engelken had wanted to be president of the Federal Land Bank for the Third District. He was appointed to that post on February 8, 1917, but remained as Mint Director until February 20; his successor, Raymond T. Baker, was nominated on February 10. Work on the new quarter was briefly interrupted by the death of Chief Engraver Barber at the age of 77 on February 18. One of von Engelken's final acts in office was to recommend the appointment of Barber's successor, Morgan, who was subsequently nominated by Wilson and confirmed by the Senate. Upon taking office in February 1917, Baker familiarized himself with the redesign of the quarter. After conferring with other Treasury officials, he decided that the redesign would be in violation of the 1890 act, and would require legislation from Congress. McAdoo concurred, and wrote to Representative William A. Ashbrook (Democrat-Ohio) on April 16, 1917. Ashbrook was not only chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, he was a noted coin collector. McAdoo explained the need for the redesign, \\"since the original dies were made the artist has found that they are not true to the original design and that a great improvement can be made in the artistic value and appearance of the coin by making the slight changes the act contemplates\\". Legislation to authorize a change was debated in the Senate on April 30, 1917; Oklahoma Senator Robert L. Owen represented that the change was needed because the coins would not stack. Wyoming Senator Francis E. Warren complained that the Mint had needed legislation to adjust coin designs in the past and it would be simpler if officials would ensure that coins would stack before releasing them into circulation. Nevertheless, the bill passed. The matter was brought up in the House of Representatives on June 25, led by Congressman Ashbrook, who told his colleagues both that the issued design was not true to the artist's concept, and that the coins would not stack well. Debate in the House focused on the fact that the legislation gave the Mint until July 1918 to effect the change as Ashbrook had stated that the Mint, having prepared the new design, was only waiting for the bill to pass to commence production. One congressman offered an amendment to change the date to 1917, and others spoke in favor of that, but they desisted when they realized that making a change would require the Senate to act again. The bill passed the House, and became law on July 9, 1917. In August, MacNeil wrote to Joyce requesting samples of the revised coin and expressing his pleasure it was being struck according to his design.  Production and collecting  Detail of 1918/7-S quarter The Standing Liberty quarter was struck at the Philadelphia Mint from 1916 to 1930 with the exception only of 1922, when no quarters were struck at any mint. It was produced less regularly at Denver and San Francisco beginning in 1917. The mint mark \\"D\\" for Denver or \\"S\\" for San Francisco may be found at the base of the wall, just to the left of Liberty's visible foot. The key date in the series is the 1916, with a mintage of 52,000. It catalogs for $3,250 even in worn Good-4 condition. The 1921 issue from Philadelphia and the 1923 from San Francisco (1923-S) are also expensive, with costs in the hundreds of dollars even for coins graded “Good-4” and “Very Good-8”. The Standing Liberty quarter is the only 20th-century regular issue US coin for which no proof coins were struck. However, a handful of specimen examples of the 1917 Type 1 issue (that is, the coins struck early in 1917 before MacNeil revised the design) exist. Breen reported six known, all with exceptionally sharp central details. This Standing Liberty quarter, like many others minted before 1925, has had its date mostly worn off through extensive circulation. It had long been a practice at the Mint to recut unused dies at the end of the year to show the following year's date. During the 18th and 19th centuries, die cutting was difficult and expensive. As making dies became cheaper and easier, the practice mostly died out around the turn of the 20th century. However, a 1917-S Type 2 die, unused by the San Francisco Mint, was recut and used to strike several thousand 1918-S quarters. Few are known, and the coins command prices in the low thousands even in well-circulated conditions. By late 1924, Mint officials realized there was a problem with the quarter in circulation. Quarters were returning to the Mint with the date completely worn off. Unwilling to seek another act of Congress, Mint officials made the step on which the date appears recessed into the design, rather than raised from it. This change solved the problem; quarters from 1925 and after are more common and cheaper in lower grades as they have survived with their dates intact. This action was among the last acts of the Engraver's Department under Morgan, who died on January 4, 1925, and was succeeded by John R. Sinnock. The modification meant that the 1927-S, with a mintage of 396,000 is much cheaper in circulated grades than the 1923-S, with a mintage of 1,360,000, though the 1927-S is more expensive in uncirculated grades. 2016-W gold Standing Liberty quarter No quarters were struck in 1931; there was no call for them in commerce due to the Depression. Since 1930, there had been an effort among those organizing the commemoration of the bicentennial of George Washington's 1732 birth to seek a Washington half dollar, to be struck as the regular issue for 1932. When a bill for a Washington commemorative was introduced to Congress in February 1931, it changed the quarter rather than the half dollar. While the reasons for the change were not recorded, the House Coinage Committee issued a memorandum stating that \\"the new design would replace the present type of quarter dollar\\", was on \\"a popular denomination\\" and \\"would replace an unsatisfactory design now being issued\\". Congress passed the act on March 4, 1931, and the new Washington quarter began to be struck in 1932, ending the Standing Liberty series. Nevertheless, many Standing Liberty quarters remained in circulation until silver coins began to be hoarded by the public in 1964, prompting the change to base-metal pieces. The United States Mint in 2015 announced plans to restrike for collectors, in gold, the three silver coins first issued in 1916. The quarter would have its weight and fineness inscribed on the obverse, and thus would technically be a bullion coin. The quarter was to be the original 1916, with the bared breast. No more than 100,000 were minted at the West Point Mint (mint mark \\"W\\" is in the same location as all other coins of this type).

Work in music theory As a music theorist, Morris's work has bridged an important gap between the rigorously academic and the highly experimental. Born in Cheltenham, England in 1943, Morris received his musical education at the Eastman School of Music (B.M. in composition with distinction) and the University of Michigan (M.M. and D.M.A. in composition and ethnomusicology), where he studied composition with John La Montaine, Leslie Bassett, Ross Lee Finney , and Eugene Kurtz. At Tanglewood, as a Margret Lee Crofts Fellow, he worked with Gunther Schuller. Morris has taught composition, electronic music, and music theory at the University of Hawaii and at Yale University, where he was Chairman of the Composition Department and Director of the Yale Electronic Music Studio. He was also Director of the Computer and Electronic Studio, Director of Graduate (music) Studies, and Associate Professor of Music at the University of Pittsburgh . In 1980 Morris joined the faculty of the Eastman School of Music where he currently teaches as Professor of Composition. (He was chair of the Composition Department from 1999–2005 and before that a member of both the composition and music theory departments.) Other teaching posts have included positions at the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, the Governor's School for the Arts held at Bucknell University, the University of Pittsburgh Computer Music Workshop, and the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood. Written works =Musical compositions= Morris has written music for a wide diversity of musical forms and media. He has composed over 160 works including computer and improvisational music. Much of his output from the 1970s is influenced by non- Western music and uses structural principles from Arabic, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, and early Western musics. While such influences are less noticeable in his more recent works, the temporal and ornamental qualities of Eastern music have permanently affected Morris's style. Moreover, Morris has found much resonance among his musical aesthetics, his experiences in hiking (especially in the Southwestern United States), his study and appreciation of Carnatic Music of South India, and his reading of ancient Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Buddhist texts. Among his present compositional projects is a series of the works to be played outdoors in a natural setting. Seven of these works are complete and have been performed: Playing Outside (2000), Coming Down to Earth (2002), Oracle (2005), Sound/Path/Field (2006), Arboretum (2009), Sun, Moon, Earth (2012) and Four Gardens (2014). =Books= In addition to his music, Morris has written three books and over 50 articles and reviews which have appeared in the Journal of Music Theory, In Theory Only, Music Theory Spectrum, Journal of the American Musicology Society, and Perspectives of New Music, contributing to theories of musical analysis and aesthetics, compositional design, and electronic and computer music. Morris was the recipient of the \\"Outstanding Publication Award\\" of the Society for Music Theory in 1988 for his book, Composition with Pitch-Classes: A Theory of Compositional Design, published by Yale University Press, and in 2001 for his article \\"Voice Leading Spaces\\" in Music Theory Spectrum 20/2.

The dual rear wheels add stability and weight capacity and the cutaway feature facilitates access between the cab and the patient care areas. Cutaway van chassis are used by second stage manufacturers for a wide range of completed motor vehicles. Especially popular in the United States, they are usually based upon incomplete vans made by manufacturers such as Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors which are generally equipped with heavier duty components than most of their complete products. To these incomplete vehicles, a second stage manufacturer adds specific equipment and completes the vehicle. Common applications of this type of vehicle design and manufacturing includes small trucks, school buses, recreational vehicles, minibuses, and ambulances. The term \\"cutaway\\" can be somewhat of a misnomer in most of the vehicle's context since it refers to truck bodies for heavy-duty commercial-grade applications sharing a common truck chassis. Design history Following the initial popularity of Volkswagen's imported minibuses, vans made by the domestic manufacturers were developed and became popular in the United States in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors were all manufacturing many models of passenger and utility vans. The Dodge passenger vans of Chrysler had a maximum seating capacity of 14 persons plus the driver, and came to be commonly known as 15 passenger vans, joined by similar sized models by the other manufacturers years later. Conversions for personal motor homes became very popular, drawing the interest of recreational vehicle manufacturers. Based upon that, cutaway van chassis were developed in the early 1970s to accommodate demand for conversions which were heavier and wider than the standard production vans completed by the major auto and truck manufacturers (i.e. Chevrolet-GM, Dodge, and Ford). As they began working on bigger models of their popular light-duty van products, they developed cutaway van chassis solely for use by second stage manufacturers. =Busette: first of the cutaway school buses= Busette, developed by Wayne Corporation in 1972, was the first successful small school bus to be based on a cutaway van chassis with dual rear wheels. With a low center of gravity and the dual rear wheels, Busette provided a combination of increased seating capacity and handling stability over conventional vans and van conversions. By the early 1980s, all five of the major school bus body companies in the United States had developed competing products built on the cutaway van chassis. These manufacturers were joined by several others which specialized in small school buses. In the early 1990s, Mid Bus, an Ohio manufacturer specializing in small school buses, purchased the tooling and product rights to build the Busette from Wayne Corporation, and produced Busettes for a few more years. In modern times, more small school buses are based upon cutaway van chassis than any other type. Most school bus body builders also produce models for non-school use, often called a \\"commercial minibus\\".  Manufacture  As produced by the first stage (van) manufacturers, a cutaway van chassis generally features a van front end and cab design. The body ends immediately behind the driver and front passenger seats, and is usually covered by temporary plywood or heavy cardboard material for shipment to the various second stage manufacturers. It was soon known by the name \\"cutaway van chassis\\" in recognition of this feature. Higher-GVWR vehicles are derived from medium-duty truck chassis. Second stage manufacturers, known in the industry as \\"body-builders,\\" build such products as bus and truck bodies, motor homes, and other specialized vehicles. Neither their product, nor the first stage portion, legally defined as an \\"incomplete motor vehicle\\" under the Federal Motor Vehicle safety Standards (FMVSS) in the US, are fully compliant with requirements for a complete motor vehicle. Neither portion can be licensed or operated lawfully without the other. Many cutaway chassis are equipped with dual rear wheels and can handle greater weight loads than the basic vans upon which they were based. Design overview =Ambulances= Chevrolet G30 and Silverado cutaway-chassis ambulances (New Zealand) In the United States, the 1973 National EMS Systems Act, which was passed by Congress in 1974, and implemented four years later (in 1978), required that communities receiving federal funds for their programs had ambulances that met new federal specifications. The regulations included minimum width and other requirements which virtually eliminated car-based vehicles. The last American-made car- based ambulance was built in 1978. The United States General Services Administration has published a standard for ambulance construction, KKK-A-1822F, which has been adopted by many states and localities, including Nebraska, Illinois, Mississippi, Oregon, and Decatur County, Indiana. Designs based upon the cutaway van chassis with modular bodies are defined as Type III. (Type I uses pickup truck chassis and Type II are straight conversion of van with a raised roof rather than a modular body.) This standard is due to be withdrawn in 2015 in favor of NFPA 1917. Many of these models have access between the driver and the patient care area, which for some applications, is a favorable feature over a full cab chassis with a modular box. The same standards are practiced in Canada, but the legislation defining the types are provincially determined. =Commercial minibuses= International Durastar cutaway chassis has a low-floor minibus body produced by second-stage manufacturer IC Bus. Seeking to expand product offerings, several recreational vehicle manufacturers, notably Champion, ElDorado National, Turtletop, and others also developed minibus models using cutaway van chassis and body construction similar to their motor homes. With their products, they joined the school bus body companies in seeking and expanding markets. Minibuses customarily have a seating capacity of between 8 and 30 seats. They are used in a wide variety of applications. In a public transport role, they can be used as fixed route transit buses, airport buses, flexible demand responsive transport vehicles, share taxis or large taxicabs. Wheelchair accessible minibuses can also be used for paratransit type services, by local authorities, transit operators, hospitals or charities. Private uses of minibuses can include corporate transport, charter buses, tour buses, and for non-profit organizations such as churches. =Delivery trucks= This Ford E350 SRW cutaway van chassis has a delivery truck body typical of that used in truck rental fleets. Cutaway van chassis also found a popular application for delivery vehicles and small trucks. They featured a size and weight capacity similar to the earlier step van model trucks and more of an automobile style cab area. With easier adjustment of drivers accustomed to operating automobiles than most type of small trucks, they found especially strong acceptance in rental truck fleets. Usually, the entrance is via a large door in the rear which opens almost the full width of the body. Some models such as those offered by U-Haul use small dual rear wheels to provide the least amount of intrusion of the rear wheel wells into the cargo area. =Recreational vehicles (motor homes)= Two Class C motor homes bodied by Thor Motor Coach: a Freightliner Sprinter (left) and a Ford E450 chassis A recreational vehicle (or \\"RV\\") is a motor vehicle dually used as both a vehicle and a temporary travel home. They are also called \\"motor homes\\" and are very popular in North America. By the mid 1970s, recreational vehicle builders were building models based upon cutaway van chassis. Within the industry, a motor home based upon a cutaway van chassis is a Class C motor home. It is built on a truck chassis with an attached cab section, which is usually cutaway van chassis based (but may also be pickup truck based or even large truck based). They are often (but not necessarily) characterized by a distinctive \\"cab-over\\" profile, the portion of the coach over the cab containing a bed or an \\"entertainment\\" section.

The Colonial Georgian design of Rec Hall was chosen to \\"harmonize\\" with other new structures on campus. Rec Hall has undergone many renovations over its history. In recent history, the drop ceiling that was installed in the 1960s was removed in the late 1990s and the building's original roof line was restored, exposing the open steel truss ceiling and upper windows. Along with this, lighting and building acoustics were also improved. In 2005 electronic LED scoreboards were installed and lower seating bowl bleachers were replaced. Renovation of Rec Hall's south wing was completed in 2006, including expansion of the student fitness center.

Overview  According to the Brazilian census in 2012 the town had 202,309 inhabitants. The city is growing quickly because many industries settled there and the soybean plantation is considered a \\"new gold rush\\" in the region, attracting emigrants from distant regions of Brazil. These people are from the South and Southeast regions who used to work with cattle ranching. The farming is extensive and very automated compared to other parts of Brazil. The farms are interesting as when the industry was labor-intensive the owners built small villages around the main house for the workers. These \\"villages\\" were self- contained and included schools and medical facilities. Rarely used now for their original purpose many still stand.

He was the first of a series of True Whig presidents who held power uninterruptedly until 1980. Early years Gardiner was born in Southampton County, Virginia in the United States. In 1831, when he was still a child, his family relocated to Liberia under the sponsorship of the American Colonization Society. Gardiner received his law degree in Liberia and, in 1847, he served as a delegate to the National Convention, which drafted Liberia's declaration of independence and constitution. He became Liberia's first attorney general and later served in the House of Representatives of Liberia from 1855 to 1871. He served as Speaker of the House of Representatives 1860-1861. In May 1871, he was elected vice-president and was elected once again, serving until 1876. During the incapacitation of President J. J. Roberts from 1875 until early 1876, Gardiner was also acting president. Less than two years after leaving office as acting president, Gardiner won election to the presidency, taking office in 1878. In the same election, the True Whig Party won a massive victory and proceeded to dominate Liberian politics until a coup d'état in 1980 ended almost a century and a half of minority rule by the Americo-Liberians. During this time period, the Liberian government generally excluded native Liberians from state office and upper level bureaucratic positions. Although they comprised a majority of the population, native Liberians were overwhelming poor and disenfranchised. In 1985, Samuel K. Doe became the first indigenous President of Liberia. Presidency (1878–1883) The decades after 1868, escalating economic difficulties weakened the state's dominance over the coastal indigenous population. Conditions worsened, the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and timber. Liberia tried desperately to modernize its largely agricultural economy. As president, Gardiner called for increased trade with and investment from outside countries, improved public education, and closer relations with Liberia's native peoples. However, his policies were overshadowed by the ramifications of the European powers \\"scramble for Africa\\". =Territorial conflicts with European powers= Rivalries between the Europeans colonizing West Africa and the interest of the United States helped preserve Liberian independence during this period, and until 1919, in spite of Liberia's ongoing disputes with England and France. During Gardiner's administration difficulties with the British Empire and Imperial Germany reached a crisis. Liberia was drawn into a border conflict with the British Empire over the Gallinas territory, lying between the Sewa River and the Mano River—territory which now forms the extreme eastern part of Sierra Leone. The British made a formal show of force at Monrovia in a mission led by Sir Arthur Havelock; meanwhile, the looting of a German vessel along the Kru Coast and personal indignities inflicted by the natives upon the shipwrecked Germans, led to the bombardment of Nana Kru by the German corvette and the presentation at Monrovia of a claim for damages, payment of which was forced by the threat of the bombardment of the capital. =Resignation= President Gardiner resigned on January 20, 1883, due to a serious illness. He was succeeded by the vice- president, Alfred F. Russell. Two months later, in March 1883, the British Government would annex the Gallinas territory west of the Mano River and formally incorporate it into Sierra Leone.

At the time of the 2011 census, there were 12,167 people living in the town with another 861 nearby. It is the administrative center of Ghanzi District and is known as the \\"Capital of the Kalahari\\". Ghanzi District measures and is bordered by Ngamiland to the north, Central District to the east, and Kgalagadi and Kweneg Districts to the south. Its western border is shared with Namibia to 203 km. Have shopping options in Spar, Choppis and food & stay at Kalahari Arms Hotel. Ghanzi aerial view (2018) Location of Ghanzi in Botswana Other spellings Other spellings of Ghanzi include \\"Gantsi\\", which is more consistent with Setswana, the national language of Botswana; \\"Ghansi\\"; and \\"Ghantsi\\". It has also been purported that the various renderings of Ghanzi actually stem from the Naro language word \\"Gaentsii\\", meaning \\"swollen buttocks\\", referring to the good health of antelope and, later, cattle that congregated around a pan in the area. History The first Afrikaner to settle in Ghanzi was the flamboyant Hendrik van Zyl, who crossed the Kalahari and set up a small hunting and trading enterprise in the area around 1870 and gained extravagant wealth in the ivory trade. However, the first substantial Boer migration into Ghanzi began around 1897-1898. The place known today as Ghanzi was first called \\"Kamp\\". The Kalahari Arms Hotel and the Barclays bank in Ghanzi were some of the first businesses established in Ghanzi. The town of Ghanzi was the subject of a 1988 LA Times article which described the close-knit relationship between resident Afrikaners and Bushmen. At the time, there was no radio or television in Ghanzi, and the Kalahari Arms Hotel, which was surrounded by a 9 foot high fence to keep lions out, hosted the only bar and discotheque in the area.Myre, Greg. \\"Afrikaners Amid the Bushmen of the Kalahari: Botswana Outpost Bends Black, White.\\" LA Times [Los Angeles] 10 Jan. 1988: n. pag.

Residents of this place speak different languages such as Afrikaans, English, Sesarwa, Setswana, Sekgalagadi and Seherero, but their standard language is Shekgalagari. Though there is no available information as to the current numbers of the Afrikaner population, in 1973, Kalahari Boer made up about 10% of the population in Ghanzi.Russell, Margo and Martin Russell. \\"Ghanzi Afrikaners 1973: a domestic description\\", Afrikaners of the Kalahari. 1st ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979. 40-57. Cambridge Books Online. Web. 13 April 2016. Geology and climate The district's land surface mainly consists of gently undulating sandveld which lies between 1,100 and 1,230 meters above sea level. The Kalahari is the largest continuous stretch of sand in the world, covering some 2,500 km2. Karoo sediments, covered by younger basaltic lavas, underlie most of the Kalahari sands and about half of the country of Botswana. The sands of the Kalahari vary in depth from 5m to 200m. The climate is semi-arid. Mean maximum daily temperatures are 33-45 °C in January and around 22 °C in July; mean minimum temperatures are 4 to -5 °C in the winter months. The long-term mean annual rainfall is around 375mm although this can vary by up to 50% year by year. Generally speaking, both the climate and the soils are unfavorable for arable farming. Small cultivation is spread over the district but is limited to subsistence crops of maize, sorghum, beans, peas, and melons. Commercial developments Ghanzi has three banks – Barclays Bank, First National Bank, and Bank Gaborone, all of which have ATMs. Ghanzi now has three shopping centres, Ghanzi Spar, Shoprite and the recently opened Choppies, another retailer in Botswana. Ghanzi Airport serves the town. There is currently no scheduled service, only charter and private operations. Tourism and events An annual agricultural show usually in August attracts many people from all over southern Africa. The people in Ghanzi come together and celebrate. Actions are also held at the premises and BDF (Botswana Defense Force) usually comes to show their weaponry. Ghanzi is a stop over point for travellers wishing to visit the Okavango Delta; there are many lodges in the area and three filling stations. It is the only available fill-up point between Kang and Maun, which is about 500 km, if one are travelling to the Okavango Delta. There is one hotel in Ghanzi town, the Kalahari Arms Hotel which offers accommodation and has a restaurant and bar open to non-residents. Tau Tona Lodge is another hotel approximately 5 km from the centre of town it also has accommodation and a restaurant and bar open to non-residents. Less formal accommodation, food and drink is available at Thakadu Camp about 6 km from the centre of town. There are other B&Bs; and lodges scattered throughout the town. There are some interesting things to see in Ghanzi. Kuru, which is a charity assisting the San / Bushmen has a small shop selling hand made Bushmen crafts. There are few sightseeing spots in Ghanzi - lions are kept in enclosures at the main gate of TauTona. \\"Ghanzi gat\\" is a hole that was made while the tar road was being made in Ghanzi, but while using dynamite to break the rock open, the people accidentally opened a water vein. This filled the 40m deep hole with water. Agriculture Ghanzi is primarily a farming community that supplies the Botswana Meat Commission with most of the required beef.

Each restriction enzyme is highly specific, recognising a particular short DNA sequence, or restriction site, and cutting both DNA strands at specific points within this site. Most restriction sites are palindromic, (the sequence of nucleotides is the same on both strands when read in the 5' to 3' direction of each strand), and are four to eight nucleotides long. Many cuts are made by one restriction enzyme because of the chance repetition of these sequences in a long DNA molecule, yielding a set of restriction fragments. A particular DNA molecule will always yield the same set of restriction fragments when exposed to the same restriction enzyme. Restriction fragments can be analyzed using techniques such as gel electrophoresis or used in recombinant DNA technology. Illustration of typical restriction enzyme cleavage. Applications In recombinant DNA technology, specific restriction endonucleases are used that will isolate a particular gene and cleave the sugar phosphate backbones at different points (retaining symmetry), so that the double-stranded restriction fragments have single- stranded ends. These short extensions, called sticky ends, can form hydrogen bonded base pairs with complementary sticky ends on any other DNA cut with the same enzyme (such as a bacterial plasmid). In agarose gel electrophoresis, the restriction fragments yield a band pattern characteristic of the original DNA molecule and restriction enzyme used, for example the relatively small DNA molecules of viruses and plasmids can be identified simply by their restriction fragment patterns. If the nucleotide differences of two different alleles occur within the restriction site of a particular restriction enzyme, digestion of segments of DNA from individuals with different alleles for that particular gene with that enzyme would produce different fragments and that will each yield different band patterns in gel electrophoresis.

The mall opened in 1970 and was renovated and expanded in the late 1990s, bringing the property to of gross leasable area. It is currently managed and partially owned by Simon Property Group. As of , the mall is anchored by Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, Macy's in two locations, Marshalls, and Target. Previous anchors include department stores Filene's, Jordan Marsh, Woolworth's and Sears. History =Opening and expansion= The Cape Cod Mall was proposed in the late 1960s as a super- regional retail center for Barnstable County, due in part to rapid population growth. Before the mall was built, a Storyland theme park resided in its location. On June 15, 1970, the mall was opened to the public, with an initial capacity of approximately 50 stores (30-40 were occupied at the time), and was anchored by Sears, Filene's and Woolworth's, all of which formerly had locations in downtown Hyannis on Main Street. In the spring of 1976, two movie theaters, with two screens each, were built behind the mall. These two theaters would compete directly with the Hyannis Drive-In Theater, which was located right down Route 132, up until 1985. In 1977, Filene's was expanded to two levels to accommodate the need for more selling space, and was thus notable for being the first location on Cape Cod with escalators. The following year, a new wing was added on the south side of the mall, with 25 additional stores and a fourth anchor, Jordan Marsh (which previously had no presence on the Cape). The mall remained basically the same for the next two decades, with a small food court added and an interior renovation completed in the mid-1980s. In 1993, Woolworth's, which by that time was experiencing financial problems, announced their plans to close the mall store, and had vacated by early 1994. In 1996, Jordan Marsh was converted into Macy's after Federated Department Stores merged the chains. The mall's largest renovation began in the fall of 1998, the same year that Simon acquired the mall (the company currently owns 56.4% of it). An additional, atrium-style wing was built, extending through and beyond the shuttered Woolworth space. This expansion brought 40 new stores, as well as anchor stores Best Buy, Marshalls (which formerly had a store behind the mall) and a two-story Barnes & Noble (which formerly had a smaller store in the Kmart plaza directly across the street). Also featured in the new wing were a larger food court - with over 10 vendors, seating for approximately 500 people, and a central cathedral skylight - and a carousel. Other projects included doubling the size of Sears (to nearly in total) and constructing a 12-screen, stadium seating cinema complex (the only one of its kind in Barnstable County; at first owned by Hoyts and later converted to a Regal Cinemas complex). The old cinemas behind the mall were demolished for parking space. =Effects of Federated-May merger= In 2005, the May Department Store chain, which included Filene's, was acquired by Federated Department Stores, who owned Macy's. Consequently, in 2006, Federated converted the Filene's store into a Macy's women's/accessory store as their main store, while their preexisting Macy's location (the former Jordan Marsh) became a \\"men's, kids and home\\" store.HighBeam As a result, Cape Cod Mall is one of the few malls to incorporate a second Macy's store following the acquisition of May Department Stores by Federated, enabling Macy's to offer approximately of total floor space, on par with many of the larger Macy's stores nationwide. The other malls to incorporate a second Macy's (following the closure of their Filene's, or Lord & Taylor, stores) are Emerald Square in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, Fox Run Mall in Newington, New Hampshire, and Northshore Mall in Peabody, Massachusetts.http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/current/sct9807/08.php =Redevelopment= Wing of the mall at night in 2014 On September 20, 2014, three Afghanistan military officers visiting Camp Edwards went missing from the mall during an event where they were to be introduced to American culture. They were later found trying to enter Canada while asking for asylum near Niagara Falls. On August 8, 2017, Ryan Family Amusements announced that they would be opening the Ten Pin Eatery, a joint venture between Ryan Family Amusements and Chapin's Restaurant Group (a local Cape Cod restaurant chain), in the Macy's Men's, Children's, and Home Furnishings store wing. Construction began in the fall of 2017, the tenant opened on April 23, 2018. It includes a ten-pin bowling alley, a 24-person laser tag center, a full bar and a 50-game arcade. On April 4, 2018, The Cape Cod Mall and town of Barnstable released to the Cape Cod Times new renderings of a remodeled section of the mall. This rendering showed the Sears department store and other stores around that area redeveloped into two new department stores at the time named the red tenant (77,450 square feet) and the green tenant (46,050 square feet). The design of red tenant closely resembled the design of a Target store. It was also announced that the Sears Auto Center would be torn down and replaced with 41 new parking spaces. On July 10, 2018, Target announced they would be building an estimated 80,000 square foot store in the space occupied by Sears. According to the Target website the store has kids products, basics, appeal, toys, home decor, seasonal items, beach and vacation essentials, and more. The store also has a Starbucks location inside the store. The Target store opened in October 2019. On October 4, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 12 stores nationwide. The store closed on December 9, 2018. The following month, CVS, the mall's last remaining original tenant, closed its doors (the chain, however, returned inside the mall's Target store). In March 2019, mall tenants Five Guys, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Visionworks - all of which are currently located within the wing of the mall formerly anchored by Sears - were announced to be relocated to the west side of the mall where Not Your Average Joe's is currently located, and scheduled to open there by fall (coincidentally, Not Your Average Joe's is currently closed for renovations, and is slated to reopen in late summer.) On August 13, 2019, a 46,000 square foot Dick's Sporting Goods store was confirmed to be moving in to the smaller split anchor in the former Sears, next to Target. The Target store opened in October 2019, while the Dick's Sporting Goods opened on August 7, 2020.

Early life Codman was born in Cotuit, Massachusetts, on September 21, 1870. He was the son of Col. Charles Russell Codman (1829–1918), a colonel in the Union Army who commanded the 45th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and Lucy Lyman Paine (née Sturgis) Codman (1833–1907). Among his siblings were Russell Sturgis Codman; John Sturgis Codman; Anne McMasters Codman, who married Henry Bromfield Cabot; and Susan Welles Codman, who married Redington Fiske. His maternal grandfather was Russell Sturgis, a wealthy Boston merchant active in the China trade, p.207 and his uncle was noted architect and builder John Hubbard Sturgis, who designed the Codman House in Lincoln, Massachusetts and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, along with Charles Brigham. Codman received an AB from Harvard University in 1892 and an LLB degree from Harvard Law School in 1895. He passed the Massachusetts Bar exam in 1895 and began practicing as a lawyer. Career Codman, an Independent, was a member of the Executive Committee of New England Anti-Imperialist League from 1902–04. In 1904, he was a Delegate of Democratic National Convention, a Signatory of Philippine Independence Committee Petition, and he sat on the Executive Committee of Anti-Imperialist League. In 1918, he was the vice-president of Anti-Imperialist League. From 1916 until 1919, Codman served in the U.S. Army during World War I, achieving the rank of Colonel. He was also a vice-president of the Associated Charities, headed the Constitutional Liberty League and served as counsel for the Joint Legislative Committee, was a foe of prohibition. He twice represented the combined anti-Prohibition societies at Congressional hearings. Codman co-wrote Secretary Root's Record:\\"Marked Severities\\" in Philippine Warfare. Personal life In 1897, he married Norah Chadwick (1873–1961), daughter of James Read Chadwick and his wife Katherine Maria Lyman. They had two daughters, who were the wives of Guy Morris and Ransom F. Hodges. Codman died at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on December 30, 1932, and was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery, which is located in the Forest Hills section of the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.

It was independently suggested with some extension by R. Dennis Cook and Sanford Weisberg in 1983 (Cook–Weisberg test). Derived from the Lagrange multiplier test principle, it tests whether the variance of the errors from a regression is dependent on the values of the independent variables. In that case, heteroskedasticity is present. Suppose that we estimate the regression model : y = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1 x + u, \\\\, and obtain from this fitted model a set of values for \\\\widehat{u}, the residuals. Ordinary least squares constrains these so that their mean is 0 and so, given the assumption that their variance does not depend on the independent variables, an estimate of this variance can be obtained from the average of the squared values of the residuals. If the assumption is not held to be true, a simple model might be that the variance is linearly related to independent variables. Such a model can be examined by regressing the squared residuals on the independent variables, using an auxiliary regression equation of the form : \\\\widehat{u}^2 = \\\\gamma_0 + \\\\gamma_1 x + v.\\\\, This is the basis of the Breusch–Pagan test. It is a chi-squared test: the test statistic is distributed nχ2 with k degrees of freedom. If the test statistic has a p-value below an appropriate threshold (e.g. p < 0.05) then the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity is rejected and heteroskedasticity assumed. If the Breusch–Pagan test shows that there is conditional heteroskedasticity, one could either use weighted least squares (if the source of heteroskedasticity is known) or use heteroscedasticity- consistent standard errors. Procedure Under the classical assumptions, ordinary least squares is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), i.e., it is unbiased and efficient. It remains unbiased under heteroskedasticity, but efficiency is lost. Before deciding upon an estimation method, one may conduct the Breusch–Pagan test to examine the presence of heteroskedasticity. The Breusch–Pagan test is based on models of the type \\\\sigma_i^2 = h(z_i'\\\\gamma) for the variances of the observations where z_i = (1, z_{2i}, \\\\ldots, z_{pi}) explain the difference in the variances. The null hypothesis is equivalent to the (p - 1)\\\\, parameter restrictions: : \\\\gamma_2 = \\\\cdots = \\\\gamma_p = 0. The following Lagrange multiplier (LM) yields the test statistic for the Breusch–Pagan test: : \\\\text{LM}=\\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\theta} \\\\right )^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\left (-E\\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\theta\\\\, \\\\partial\\\\theta'} \\\\right ] \\\\right )^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial\\\\theta} \\\\right ). This test can be implemented via the following three-step procedure: * Step 1: Apply OLS in the model :: y_i = X_i\\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon_i, \\\\quad i=1,\\\\dots{},n * Step 2: Compute the regression residuals, \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}_i, square them, and divide by the Maximum Likelihood estimate of the error variance from the Step 1 regression, to obtain what Breusch and Pagan call g_i: :: g_i = \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}_i^2 / \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2, \\\\quad \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2 = \\\\sum{\\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}_i^2}/n * Step 2: Estimate the auxiliary regression :: g_i=\\\\gamma_1+\\\\gamma_2z_{2i}+\\\\cdots+\\\\gamma_pz_{pi}+\\\\eta_i. where the z terms will typically but not necessarily be the same as the original covariates x. * Step 3: The LM test statistic is then half of the explained sum of squares from the auxiliary regression in Step 2: :: \\\\text{LM}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\text{TSS} - \\\\text{SSR}\\\\right). where TSS is the sum of squared deviations of the g_i from their mean of 1, and SSR is the sum of squared residuals from the auxiliary regression. The test statistic is asymptotically distributed as \\\\chi^2_{p - 1} under the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity, as proved by Breusch and Pagan in their 1979 paper.  Robust variant  A variant of this test, robust in the case of a non-Gaussian error term, was proposed by Roger Koenker. In this variant, the dependent variable in the auxiliary regression is just the squared residual from the Step 1 regression, \\\\hat{\\\\varepsilon}_i^2, and the test statistic is nR^2 from the auxiliary regression. As Koenker notes (1981, page 111), while the revised statistic has correct asymptotic size its power \\"may be quite poor except under idealized Gaussian conditions.\\" Software In R, this test is performed by the function ncvTest available in the car package,MRAN: ncvTest {car} the function bptest available in the lmtest package,R documentation about bptest the function plmtest available in the plm package,MRAN: plmtest {plm} or the function breusch_pagan available in the skedastic package. In Stata, one specifies the full regression, and then enters the command \`estat hettest\` followed by all independent variables. In SAS, Breusch–Pagan can be obtained using the Proc Model option. In Python, there is a method het_breuschpagan in statsmodels.stats.diagnostic (the statsmodels package) for Breusch–Pagan test.

For census and administrative purposes Ngamiland is subdivided into Ngamiland East, Ngamiland West and Ngamiland Delta (Okavango). It is governed by a District Commissioner, appointed by the national government, and the elected North-West District Council. The administrative centre is Maun. As of 2011, the total population of the district was 175,631 compared to 142,970 in 2001. The growth rate of population during the decade was 2.08. The total number of workers constituted 32,471 with 16,852 males and 15,621 females, with a majority of them involved in agriculture. Maun, the Tsodilo Hills, the Moremi Game Reserve, the Gchwihaba (Drotsky's) Caves, the Aha Hills (on the border with Namibia), the Nhabe Museum in Maun, and Maun Educational Park are the major tourist attractions in the district. History In the late 18th century, the Tswana people, primarily herders, began expanding northward into what is now called Ngamiland. A sub-chiefdom, called Tawana out of Ngwato, was established there. In 1885 when the British established the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the northern boundary was 22° south latitude. On 30 June 1890, the northern boundary of the protectorate was formally extended northward by the British to include Ngamiland, which at the time was still under the Tawana, who by then recognized the authority of Khama III. British officials did not arrive in the Ngamiland region until 1894. Ngamiland was administered as Bechuanaland's northwestern corner and primary contact point with German South West Africa via the Caprivi Strip. In 1966 the North-West District was established which included both Ngamiland and Chobe; however, in 2006, Chobe District was again separated out. Geography Image of Maun The region has an average elevation of around above the mean sea level. The vegetation type is Savannah, with tall grasses, bushes and trees. The annual precipitation is around , most of which is received during the summer season from November to May. North-West District shares its borders with the following foreign areas: Omaheke Region, Namibia in southwest, Otjozondjupa Region, Namibia in west, Kavango East Region, Namibia in northwest and Zambezi Region, Namibia in north. Domestically, it borders Central District in southeast, Ghanzi District in southwest and Chobe District in the east. Like most of Botswana, it consists of partially dissected tablelands, in this case sloping down from the Kaukau Veld that lies to the northwest. This flow and the Okavango River drain into the mostly endorheic Okavango Delta. The delta seasonally overflows into the endorheic Lake Ngami to the south, and into the Thamalakane River which via the Boteti River feeds the Makgadikgadi salt pans to the southeast. Most of the rivers in the region are seasonal, and subject to flash floods. Maun, the Tsodilo Hills, Moremi Game Reserve, Gchwihaba (Drotsky's) Caves, Aha Hills, Nhabe Museum and Maun Educational Park are the major tourist attractions in the district.

Neoliberalism is a revised version of liberalism. Alongside neorealism, neoliberalism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives have dominated international relations theory since the 1990s.. The best formulation of neoliberal hopes can be found in the \\"democratic peace\\" theory. According to this no two mature democracies have ever fought a war against each other. Therefore, promoting liberal democracy around the world will have the side-effect of decreasing war. Since a vibrant middle class has long been recognized as a necessary condition for liberal democracy, neoliberals have focused on helping nations choose policies that would promote the creation of middle classes and democracy. Activities of the international system Neoliberal international relations thinkers often employ game theory to explain why states do or do not cooperate;KEOHANE, Robert O. - After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy, Princeton, 1984 since their approach tends to emphasize the possibility of mutual wins, they are interested in institutions which can arrange jointly profitable arrangements and compromises. Neoliberalism is a response to neorealism; while not denying the anarchic nature of the international system, neoliberals argue that its importance and effect has been exaggerated. The neoliberal argument is focused on neorealists' alleged underestimation of \\"the varieties of cooperative behavior possible within ... a decentralized system.\\" Both theories, however, consider the state and its interests as the central subject of analysis; neoliberalism may have a wider conception of what those interests are. Neoliberalism argues that even in an anarchic system of autonomous rational states, cooperation can emerge through the cultivation of mutual trust and the building of norms, regimes and institutions. In terms of the scope of international relations theory and foreign interventionism, the debate between Neoliberalism and Neorealism is an intra-paradigm one, as both theories are positivist and focus mainly on the state system as the primary unit of analysis. Development Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye have been considered the founders of the neoliberal school of thought; Keohane's book After Hegemony is a classic of the genre. Other major influences are the hegemonic stability theory of Stephen Krasner and the work of Charles P. Kindleberger, among others. Contentions =Keohane and Nye= Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, in response to neorealism, develop an opposing theory they dub \\"Complex interdependence.\\" Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explain, \\"... complex interdependence sometimes comes closer to reality than does realism.\\" In explaining this, Keohane and Nye cover the three assumptions in realist thought: First, states are coherent units and are the dominant actors in international relations; second, force is a usable and effective instrument of policy; and finally, the assumption that there is a hierarchy in international politics. The heart of Keohane and Nye's argument is that in international politics there are, in fact, multiple channels that connect societies exceeding the conventional Westphalian system of states. This manifests itself in many forms ranging from informal governmental ties to multinational corporations and organizations. Here they define their terminology; interstate relations are those channels assumed by realists; transgovernmental relations occur when one relaxes the realist assumption that states act coherently as units; transnational applies when one removes the assumption that states are the only units. It is through these channels that political exchange occurs, not through the limited interstate channel as championed by realists. Secondly, Keohane and Nye argue that there is not, in fact, a hierarchy among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state's agenda, but that there are a multitude of different agendas that come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations. Finally, the use of military force is not exercised when complex interdependence prevails. The idea is developed that between countries in which a complex interdependence exists, the role of the military in resolving disputes is negated. However, Keohane and Nye go on to state that the role of the military is in fact important in that \\"alliance's political and military relations with a rival bloc.\\" =Lebow= Richard Ned Lebow states that the failure of neorealism lies in its \\"institutionalist\\" ontology, whereas the neorealist thinker Kenneth Waltz states, \\"the creators [of the system] become the creatures of the market that their activity gave rise to.\\" This critical failure, according to Lebow, is due to the realists' inability \\"to escape from the predicament of anarchy.\\" Or rather, the assumption that states do not adapt and will respond similarly to similar constraints and opportunities.Waltz, 90; quoted in Richard Ned Lebow, \\"The long peace, the end of the cold war, and the failure of realism,\\" International Organization, 48, 2 (Spring 1994), 273 =Mearsheimer= Norman Angell, a classical London School of Economics liberal, had held: \\"We cannot ensure the stability of the present system by the political or military preponderance of our nation or alliance by imposing its will on a rival.\\"Norman Angell, The Great Illusion, (1909) cited from 1933 ed. (New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons),p. 137. Keohane and Lisa L. Martin expound upon these ideas in the mid 1990s as a response to John J. Mearsheimer's \\"The False Promise of International Institutions,\\" where Mearsheimer purports that, \\"institutions cannot get states to stop behaving as short-term power maximizers.\\" In fact Mearsheimer's article is a direct response to the liberal-institutionalist movement created in response to neo-realism. The central point in Keohane and Martin's idea is that neo-realism insists that, \\"institutions have only marginal effects ... [which] leaves [neo-realism] without a plausible account of the investments that states have made in such international institutions as the EU, NATO, GATT, and regional trading organizations.\\"Robert O. Keohane and Lisa L. Martin, \\"The Promise of Institutionalist Theory,\\" International Security 20, no. 1 (Summer 1995), 47. This idea is in keeping with the notion of complex interdependence. Moreover, Keohane and Martin argue that the fact that international institutions are created in response to state interests, that the real empirical question is \\"knowing how to distinguish the effects of underlying conditions from those of the institutions themselves.\\" The debate between the institutionalists and Mearsheimer is about whether institutions have an independent effect on state behavior, or whether they reflect great power interests that said powers employ to advance their respective interests. Mearsheimer is concerned with 'inner-directed' institutions, which he states, \\"seek to cause peace by influencing the behavior of the member states.\\" In doing so he dismisses Keohane and Martin's NATO argument in favor of the example of the European Community and the International Energy Agency. According to Mearsheimer, NATO is an alliance that is interested in \\"an outside state, or coalition of states, which the alliance aims to deter, coerce, or defeat in war.\\" Mearsheimer reasons that since NATO is an alliance it has special concerns. He concedes this point to Keohane and Martin.Mearsheimer, 83–87. However, Mearsheimer reasons, \\"to the extent that alliances cause peace, they do so by deterrence, which is straightforward realist behavior.\\" In essence, Mearsheimer believes that Keohane and Martin \\"are shifting the terms of the debate, and making realist claims under the guise of institutionalism. Mearsheimer criticizes Martin's argument that the European Community (EC) enhances the prospects of cooperation, particularly in the case of Great Britain's sanctioning of Argentina during the Falklands war, where it was able to secure the cooperation of other European states by linking the issues at hand to the EC. Mearsheimer purports that the United States was not a member of the EC and yet the US and Britain managed to cooperate on sanctions, creating an ad hoc alliance which effected change. \\"... Issue linkage was a commonplace practice in world politics well before institutions came on the scene; moreover, Britain and other European states could have used other diplomatic tactics to solve the problem. After all, Britain and America managed to cooperate on sanctions even though the United States was not a member of the EC.\\" See also * Liberal international relations theory * Institutionalism in international relations * Neoconservatism * Neorealism * New Left * Foreign interventionism * Paleoliberalism * Peace–industrial complex * Rational choice institutionalism Notes References * International relations theory Liberalism Neoliberalism ","title":"Neoliberalism (international relations)"},{"id":"2941579","text":"Sergei Konstantinovitch Pankejeff (; December 24, 1886 - May 7, 1979) was a Russian aristocrat from Odessa best known for being a patient of Sigmund Freud, who gave him the pseudonym of Wolf-Man (der Wolfsmann) to protect his identity, after a dream Pankejeff had of a tree full of white wolves.  Biography  Pankejeff with his wife c. 1910. The Pankejeff family (Freud's German transliteration from the Russian; in English it would be transliterated as Pankeyev) was a wealthy family in St. Petersburg. Sergei attended a grammar school in Russia, but after the 1905 Russian Revolution he spent considerable time abroad studying. During his review of Freud's letters and other files, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson uncovered notes for an unpublished paper by Freud's associate Ruth Mack Brunswick. Freud had asked her to review the Pankejeff case, and she discovered evidence that Pankejeff had been sexually abused by a family member during his childhood.\\"Anally seduced\\" as Masson writes, using Freud's \\"seduction\\" as an umbrella term for sexual maltreatment. Masson, Jeffrey Moussaieff. (1984) The Assault On Truth: Freud's Suppression of The Seduction Theory. Pocket Books, 1984, 1998. In 1906, his older sister Anna committed suicide while visiting the site of Mikhail Lermontov's fatal duel, and by 1907 Sergei began to show signs of serious depression. Sergei's father Konstantin also suffered from depression, often connected to specific political happenings of the day, and committed suicide in 1907 by consuming an excess of sleeping medication, a few months after Sergei had left for Munich to seek treatment for his own ailment. While in Munich, Pankejeff saw many doctors and stayed voluntarily at a number of elite psychiatric hospitals. In the summers, he always visited Russia. Der Wolfsmann (The Wolf-Man) Prescription written by Sigmund Freud for the wife of Pankejeff, November 1919. In January 1910, Pankejeff's physician brought him to Vienna to have treatment with Freud. Pankejeff and Freud met with each other many times between February 1910 and July 1914, and a few times thereafter, including a brief psychoanalysis in 1919. Pankejeff's \\"nervous problems\\" included his inability to have bowel movements without the assistance of an enema, as well as debilitating depression. Initially, according to Freud, Pankejeff resisted opening up to full analysis, until Freud gave him a year deadline for analysis, prompting Pankejeff to give up his resistances. Freud's first publication on the \\"Wolf-Man\\" was \\"From the History of an Infantile Neurosis\\" (Aus der Geschichte einer infantilen Neurose), written at the end of 1914, but not published until 1918. Freud's treatment of Pankejeff centered on a dream the latter had had as a very young child which he described to Freud: :\\"I dreamt that it was night and that I was lying in bed. (My bed stood with its foot towards the window; in front of the window there was a row of old walnut trees. I know it was winter when I had the dream, and night-time.) Suddenly the window opened of its own accord, and I was terrified to see that some white wolves were sitting on the big walnut tree in front of the window. There were six or seven of them. The wolves were quite white, and looked more like foxes or sheep-dogs, for they had big tails like foxes and they had their ears pricked like dogs when they pay attention to something. In great terror, evidently of being eaten up by the wolves, I screamed and woke up. My nurse hurried to my bed, to see what had happened to me. It took quite a long while before I was convinced that it had only been a dream; I had had such a clear and life-like picture of the window opening and the wolves sitting on the tree. At last I grew quieter, felt as though I had escaped from some danger, and went to sleep again.\\" (Freud 1918) Freud's eventual analysis (along with Pankejeff's input) of the dream was that it was the result of Pankejeff having witnessed a \\"primal scene\\" -- his parents having sex a tergo or more ferarum (\\"from behind\\" or \\"doggy style\\") -- at a very young age. Later in the paper, Freud posited the possibility that Pankejeff instead had witnessed copulation between animals, which was displaced to his parents. Pankejeff's dream played a major role in Freud's theory of psychosexual development, and along with Irma's injection (Freud's own dream, which launched dream analysis), it was one of the most important dreams for the developments of Freud's theories. Additionally, Pankejeff became one of the main cases used by Freud to prove the validity of psychoanalysis. It was the third detailed case study, after \\"Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis\\" in 1908 (also known by its animal nickname \\"Rat Man\\"), that did not involve Freud analyzing himself, and which brought together the main aspects of catharsis, the unconscious, sexuality, and dream analysis put forward by Freud in his Studies on Hysteria (1895), The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), and his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905). Later life Pankejeff later published his own memoir under Freud's given pseudonym and remained in contact with Freudian disciples until his own death (undergoing analysis for six decades despite Freud's pronouncement of his being \\"cured\\"), making him one of the longest-running famous patients in the history of psychoanalysis. A few years after finishing psychoanalysis with Freud, Pankejeff developed a psychotic delirium. He was observed in a street staring at his reflection in a mirror, convinced that some sort of doctor had drilled a hole in his nose. Ruth Mack Brunswick, a Freudian, explained the delusion as displaced castration anxiety. Criticism of Freud's interpretation Critics, beginning with Otto Rank in 1926, have questioned the accuracy and efficacy of Freud's psychoanalytic treatment of Pankejeff. Similarly, in the mid-20th century, psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley dismissed Freud's diagnosis as far-fetched and entirely speculative.\\"I have become increasingly convinced that some of the popular methods presumed to discover what is in the unconscious cannot be counted upon as reliable methods of obtaining evidence. They often involve the use of symbolism and analogy in such a way that the interpreter can find virtually anything that he is looking for. Freud, for instance, from a simple dream reported by a man in his middle twenties as having occurred at 4 years of age drew remarkable conclusions. The 4-year-old boy dreamed of seeing six or seven white wolves sitting in a tree. Freud interpreted the dream in such a way as to convince himself that the patient at 18 months of age had been shocked by seeing his parents have intercourse three times in succession and that this played a major part in the extreme fear of being castrated by his father which Freud ascribed to him at 4 years of age. No objective evidence was ever offered to support this conclusion. Nor was actual fear of castration ever made to emerge into the light of consciousness despite years of analysis.\\" Hervey Cleckley, The Mask of Sanity, 1941, fifth edition 1976, Dorpat has suggested that Freud's behavior in the Pankejeff case as an example of gaslighting (attempting to undermine someone's perceptions of reality). Daniel Goleman wrote the following in the New York Times: Maria Torok and Nicolas Abraham have reinterpreted the Wolf-Man's case (in The wolf-man’s magic word, a cryptonymy), presenting their notion of \\"the crypt\\" and what they call “cryptonyms.\\" They provide a different analysis of the case than Freud, whose conclusions they criticise. According to the authors, Pankejeff's statements hide other statements, while the actual content of his words can be illuminated by looking into his multi-lingual background. According to the authors, Pankejeff hid secrets concerning his older sister, and as the Wolf- Man both wanted to forget and preserve these issues, he encrypted his older sister, as an idealised \\"other\\" in the heart of himself, and spoke these secrets out loud in a cryptic manner, through words hiding behind words, rebuses, wordplays etc. For example, in the Wolf-Man's dream, where six or seven wolves were sitting in a tree outside his bedroom window, the expression \\"pack of six\\", a \\"sixter\\" = shiestorka: siestorka = sister, which gives the conclusion that his sister is placed in the centre of the trauma. The case forms a central part of the second plateau of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, titled \\"One or Several Wolves?\\" In it, they repeat the accusation made in Anti-Oedipus that Freudian analysis is unduly reductive and that the unconscious is actually a \\"machinic assemblage\\".

It was jointly created by Godfrey Philipp, who produced the series, and actor-writer John Michael Howson, who also co-starred in the show. It typically aired from Monday to Friday and each story would stretch across a full week, reaching a resolution on Friday.Albert Moran, Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, AFTRS 1993 p 42 Adventure Island was a joint production of Godfrey Philipp Productions and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, pre-recorded on videotape at the ABC's studios in Ripponlea, Melbourne. It is believed to be the first program made by the ABC in collaboration with an outside production company. Production was usually five weeks ahead of broadcast. It was a pantomime-style series set in the kingdom of Diddley-Dum-Diddley. The show was hosted by Nancy Cato (a cousin of the noted author of the same name) from 1967 to 1968 (her final pre-recorded episodes aired at the beginning of 1969) and Sue Donovan from 1969 to 1972. Characters Regular characters included: * Liza (Liz Harris) * Clown (John- Michael Howson), * Mrs Flower Potts (Brian Crossley), * Percy Panda (Jack Manuel), * Dodo Panda (1967–1969) (Marion Edward), * Betty Bruin (Carole Walker), * Smiling Jim (James Smillie). * Baddies including Fester Fumble (Ernie Bourne), Miser Meanie (Colin McEwan (1967–1968), Robert Essex (1969–1972)), Captain Crook (Ernie Bourne), Giggles Goblin (Peter Homewood) and Squire Squeezum (Burt Cooper). Other characters were played by guest artists such as Vivean Gray (playing Mother Sparkle, who became Mother Tinkle—more famously Mrs Jessup in The Sullivans and Mrs Mangle in Neighbours), Patsy King, Brian Hannan, Frank Rich, Mary Hardy, Angela O'Toole and Lindsay Edwards. Pre-production Following the May 1967 announcement of the imminent axing of the highly popular Independent Television System children's programme The Magic Circle Club, made in Melbourne at the ATV0 studios in the suburb of Nunawading, the ABC immediately approached its producers with a proposal to immediately take over production of the show. This was very quickly thwarted when the 0-10 Network's then owner Reg Ansett refused to relinquish his network's rights to the show's name and premise, forcing Philipp and Howson to devise a lookalike. Adventure Island's creation was credited to both Philipp and Howson, although Liz Harris recalls Howson verbalising the show's entire premise and setting, as well as naming all the characters, during a short promotional aeroplane flight in mid-1967. Writing Whereas on The Magic Circle Club Howson shared scriptwriting duties fairly equally with Peter Homewood and Max Bartlett, for Adventure Island Howson wrote most of the scripts, with others contributed by Peter Homewood. Howson also wrote four illustrated storybooks based on the show which were given a single limited print run. They quickly sold out and are now extremely rare. 1967–68 Nancy Cato was Adventure Island's first host during 1967–68. Cato had been forced to leave The Magic Circle Club dramatically in 1966 after an on-set accident, and she joined Adventure Island after her recovery. Each show would begin with Cato in an enchanted wood (one of the show's few direct similarities with The Magic Circle Club). In early episodes, Nancy would sit down behind a tree-stump lectern on which was poised a magic book, open the book and begin to read the story. The story would be based on a place called Adventure Island and the residents of its town of Diddley-Dum-Diddley, and viewers would see the story played out by the characters themselves. In later episodes, Nancy would begin the show by bantering with puppets Gussie Galah, Crispian Cockatoo and Matilda Mouse, then read from the book. At the conclusion of each chapter, Nancy would talk to a cat puppet, which was named Samson in a viewer competition early in the show's run. 1969-72 Sue Donovan (wife of actor Terence Donovan and the mother of actor-singer Jason Donovan) took over the hosting role in 1969 after Cato's unexpected departure. The show's basic structure remained, but each episode instead began with a conversation with a talking house (Mister House, later named Serendipity House in a viewer competition) voiced by Jack Manuel and sometimes Ernie Bourne). Sue would then walk into the house where she would ad-lib with Crispian Cockatoo and Gracie Galah on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and with Maxie Mouse (Ernie Bourne) and a vertical waveform called Chi on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A chime would sound to indicate it was time for Sue to read the book. Each show would close with Sue talking to Samson the cat, but on Fridays she would click her fingers and magically transport herself to Diddley-Dum-Diddley for a sitdown chat and a cup of tea with all the characters. Premise The show was highly moralistic with a strong \\"good over evil\\" motif in every story. The scripted part of the show—a story serialised over five days, Monday to Friday—usually involved the inhabitants of Diddley-Dum-Diddley being set upon or tricked in some way by one or more of the \\"baddies\\". On many occasions the usually dimwitted Clown (with sawdust for a brain and an appalling memory) would save the day with his uncanny ability to see through disguises, a skill not possessed by the other residents of the town. Some weeks' episodes would include no baddies at all, but instead centre around a visitor to Diddley-Dum-Diddley, often a relative of one of the characters, or a business-person or entrepreneur of some sort. Concerned that some children may become upset by the mischief created by the baddies or the dilemmas faced by the Diddley-Dum-Diddleys, it was common at times of high drama for a cast member to remind the young audience that \\"it always turns out all right on Fridays\\". The highly melodramatic, overplayed tone of the show was rooted in very traditional camp and pantomime traditions, and utilised a genre of light entertainment and humour appreciated by children for its simplicity and by adults for its escapism and sly nods. Music In true 'panto' style, music was an essential element of Adventure Island. Nearly every moment was accompanied by instrumental improvisation. Each episode contained two original songs relevant to the show's plot. The lyrics for these were typically written by the week's scriptwriter (either Howson or Homewood) and set to music by musical director Bruce Rowland. After Rowland departed the show in 1971 many of the songs he had written were reused in later episodes. Rowland found great fame and respect during the '70s and '80s in the field of movie soundtracks. His replacement was Alan Teak. The songs were almost always pre-recorded on Thursdays, then pressed to acetate and given to the actors to take home and learn so they could be accurately lip-synched during taping. A notable exception to the pre-recording rule was John Michael Howson's outstanding and moving live-to-camera performance of A Clown Without A Smile in episode 1174 (one of only a handful of episodes that have survived). Puppets In each episode's unscripted segments, the hostess would converse with puppet characters. It was at these points in the show that viewer contributions (drawings, riddles, jokes, etc.) would be aired. The puppets which appeared on Adventure Island were: Gussie Galah, operated by Colin McEwan (1967–68) Crispian Cockatoo, operated by Ernie Bourne (1967–72) Matilda Mouse, operated by Marion Edward (1967–68) Samson (cat), operated by Ernie Bourne (1967–72) Gracie Galah, operated by Brian Crossley (1969–72) Maxie Mouse, operated by Ernie Bourne (1969–72) A female version of Samson, operated by Liz Harris, appeared for several weeks in 1971 when Ernie Bourne was forced to take a break for health reasons. Gussie is probably the most notorious, but least remembered, puppet character on Adventure Island. A brilliant McEwan creation, his intensely squawking voice, disruptive manner and constant teasing of Nancy Cato took the hilarious whining of Leonardo de Fun Bird (from The Magic Circle Club) to a completely new level. When McEwan left the show, Gussie was replaced by a more cultured female galah, Gracie, who was slightly taller in stature. Samson was a large hand puppet, similar to a Muppet. All the other puppets were mechanical creations. The operator would pull down on a rod, either underneath or inside the body of the puppet, to open the mouth or beak. The show's puppets were constructed by Axel Axelrad, who was typically named in the credits simply as \\"Axel\\". Magic As in The Magic Circle Club all of the characters in Adventure Island, including the hostesses, possessed magic powers which they could call upon if the need arose. These were used sparingly, most likely because of technical difficulties in performing videotape drop-edits with the cumbersome videotape technology of the day. Each Friday episode generally concluded with the hostess visiting Adventure Island and sitting with the characters to discuss the week's adventure. She would transport herself there by clicking her fingers. Samson (the pussycat) was actually a magic cat who would be invisible until Monday afternoon's episode. To make him appear, the hostess would need to answer a question he would ask from \\"beyond\\". He would disappear again on Friday afternoons by sneezing. Colour No episodes of Adventure Island were produced in colour, since Australian TV was at that time broadcast in black- and-white, and there was evidently no plan to sell the program overseas. A popular belief by many viewers that the show was in colour could be attributed in large part to the brilliant sets which, for most of the show's run, were designed by Paul Cleveland. Howson has said that in 1971 an American network expressed strong interest in the show and were only reluctant to make an offer due to its monochrome format. Howson proposed a solution to the ABC in which the entire five shows would be restaged on Tuesdays but this time filmed in colour—the cast and crew now totally familiar with the scripts, having performed them for the videotaped version on Sunday and Monday—but his proposal was met with total disinterest by the ABC and was never considered. A brief piece of colour footage (actually an offcut from a 1972 ABC magazine show story on the show's closure) was aired for the first time in 1996 as part of an ABC 40th anniversary programme. Awards *Adventure Island won the first TV Week Logie award in the newly established category of Best Children's Show in 1969 (for programmes broadcast in 1968). *In 1971, Sue Donovan won the Logie for Best Female Personality (Victoria). *For his contribution to Australian children's television, Godfrey Philipp won a special Logie award in 1973. (In 1979, Godfrey's programme Rainbow won a further Logie for Outstanding Contribution To Children's TV.) Cancellation The show's axing, announced in mid-1972, was highly controversial—not least because it was replaced by the American program Sesame Street—and an unprecedented flood of public protest ensued. A group of MPs headed by David Kennedy launched a \\"Save Adventure Island\\" campaign during which questions were asked in Parliament. However the campaign was unsuccessful and the final episode, number 1175, aired on 22 December 1972. Godfrey Philipp had been the mastermind behind the Australian Labor Party's successful \\"It's Time\\" campaign, which in 1972 brought about a change in government in Australia for the first time in 22 years, so the decision to cancel Adventure Island may have been politically rather than economically motivated. In popular culture The costume for Percy Panda was used in a semi-regular segment on the ABC comedy The Late Show titled Shirty, the slightly aggressive bear, a send-up of children's television, in which the Shirty character would commit various violent atrocities. In the final Shirty segment, it was revealed that the occupant of the bear suit was Russell Crowe as his character from Romper Stomper. In the first episode of The Micallef Program, host Shaun Micallef introduces the supporting cast as being recycled from old ABC television programs, stating that viewers may recognise cast member Roz Hammond as \\"the horribly mutilated corpse from the final episode of Adventure Island. I think Clown is revealed as the psychopath in that one.\\" Archival remnants Many of the early episodes of Adventure Island appear to no longer exist. However, a search of the National Archives of Australia reveals 998 listings of audiovisual archival material for the program, most of which appears to be complete episodes stored as black and white film recordings. Although quite a few were wiped there are at least 955 episodes that do exist. Most of which are later episodes. The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia database contains listings for six episodes, preserved on 16mm film and in video copies—one from 1967, one from 1971, and four consecutive episodes (1171–1174) from 1972, which are among the last to have been produced. The fate of Adventure Island is consistent with that of many other ABC-TV programs from the same period. In the late 1970s ABC-TV management instituted a policy of \\"recycling\\" videotape as a cost-cutting measure and this was especially targeted at older programs made in B&W.; All departments of ABC-TV were obliged to surrender tapes and as a result a large amount of historically significant videotaped programming from the 1960s and early 1970s was erased. However, the closure of the former Gore Hill studios in Sydney in 2002–03 uncovered large amounts of uncatalogued film and video footage, including many hours of live performance footage from GTK and material other programs long thought to have been lost, including 'missing' portions of The Aunty Jack Show and it is therefore possible that more material from Adventure Island may have survived. The Performing Arts Collection at the Arts Centre, Melbourne, holds a substantial number of costumes, props, photographs and related documents for the production, with the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra also holding a substantial collection of production documentation and photographs relating to the show. The Adventure Island storybook, from which Cato and Donovan read each day, is now part of the collection of Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. The donor, who was working at the ABC's Rippon Lea studios as a props staffer at the time, rescued the book from a dumpster where it had been discarded in 1988.Powerhouse Museum Collection search, accessed 5 July 2009 In Memoriam Several cast members of Adventure Island have died in recent years. * Colin McEwan - 22 August 2005 (64) * Marion Edward * Peter Homewood - 22 December 2008 (79, one day short of his 80th birthday) * Ernie Bourne - 21 January 2009 (82) * Brian Crossley - 8 September 2012 (85) On 22 January 2009, the day after Ernie Bourne's death, the following notice appeared in Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper: > BOURNE, Ernie - A dear, lovable and funny man who brightened the lives of > children around Australia and his fellow Cast Members in the Magic Circle > Club and Adventure Island.

It is considered a key hub of Melbourne's nightlife and is home to many pubs, nightclubs, restaurants, and adult entertainment venues. Part of the original Hoddle Grid laid out in 1837, the road has become a main traffic thoroughfare connecting Southbank and North Melbourne through the city centre. King street is named for Captain Philip Gidley King, the third Governor of New South Wales.Street Names  Geography  King Street begins at Flinders Street and ends at the intersection of Hawke Street and Victoria Street in West Melbourne. Towards the northern end of King Street lay the Flagstaff Gardens, whilst the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium and Crown Casino are at its southern tip. King Street becomes Kings Way south of Flinders Street. The street was part of National Routes 1 and 79 until the city bypass road linking the Monash Freeway with the Westgate Freeway was completed. Crossing through Melbourne's main financial district, many of Melbourne's tallest office towers line King Street. The area was once lined with bluestone warehouses, some of which still exist to the present day. Notable buildings The street has many examples of modern architecture, some designed by Yuncken Freeman who also had their offices located on the street. Many King Street buildings are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and/or classified by the National Trust of Australia, including: St James Old Cathedral * St James Old Cathedral, the oldest church in Melbourne (1847) * 328-330 King Street, the oldest residence in Melbourne (1850) * Former York Butter Factory (1852) * Former F. Blight & Company Warehouse, currently Colonial Hotel (1853) * Former Zanders No 3 Warehouse (1854) * Former Levicks & Piper Wholesale Ironmongers Warehouse (1859) * Former Phoenix Clothing Company (1859) * Langdon Building (1863) * New Zealand Mercantile building (1909) * Former Melbourne Wool Exchange, currently Australian Institute of Music City Campus (1913) Other prominent buildings include: * Great Western Hotel, a pub continuously operating for 150 years (1864) * Rialto Towers, formerly Melbourne's tallest building (1986) * The Melbourne Stock Exchange (1990) * Victoria University's City King St campus Collins, with the Federal Coffee Palace on the right. The building was demolished at the height of a contemporary boom in the early 1970s. As with many of Melbourne's streets, several notable heritage buildings were demolished during the 1960s and 1970s, including: * The Federal Coffee Palace (1888, demolished 1972) * Robb's Buildings (1885, demolished 1985) Adult entertainment district During the 1980s many former warehouses at the southern end of King Street (and in nearby Flinders Street) were converted into night clubs. King Street subsequently became Melbourne's main nightclub district, with some of Melbourne's largest clubs including Clique Lounge Bar, Tramp, Inflation, La Di Da, Brown Alley & Sorry Grandma along the strip. The street is also considered the hub of Melbourne's adult entertainment venues, including Goldfingers, The Men's Gallery,The Men's Gallery Dallas Dancers, Bar 20, Centrefold LoungeCentrefold Lounge and Spearmint Rhino.

Secondary deviance is a stage in a theory of deviant identity formation.Lemert, Edwin. 1967. Human Deviance, Social Problems and Social Control. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Introduced by Edwin Lemert in 1951, primary deviance is engaging in the initial act of deviance, he subsequently suggested that secondary deviance is the process of a deviant identity, integrating it into conceptions of self, potentially affecting the individual long term. For example, if a gang engaged in primary deviant behavior such as acts of violence, dishonesty or drug addiction, subsequently moved to legally deviant or criminal behavior, such as murder, this would be the stage of secondary deviance. Primary acts of deviance are common in everyone, however these are rarely thought of as criminal acts. Secondary deviance is much more likely to be considered as criminal in a social context. The act is likely to be labelled as deviant and criminal, which can have the effect of an individual internalizing that label and acting out accordingly. Lemert made another distinction between primary deviance and secondary deviance. Originally, there may not be a distinguished group of \\"deviant\\" people, but instead we all switch in and out of deviant behavior and a minority or these individuals starting the rule-breaking acts actually get the attention of others. In that very moment, a person is engaging in secondary deviance and it is said that they start following a more deviant path, or a deviant career - would be a set of roles shaped by the reactions of others in different situations. One's self-identity is vulnerable to all of the social judgement and criticism, and once more we see the continued interplay between the mind, self and society. As Erving Goffman (1961, 1963) showed, when an individual is labelled with a \\"discrediting\\" social attribute like shyness can often serve as a permanent mark on one's character.  Deviancy Process  Lemert listed out the process, which he decided, was the way that an individual becomes a secondary deviant. # Primary Deviation; # Societal Penalties; # Further primary deviation; # Stronger penalties and rejections; # Further deviation; # Crisis reached in the tolerance quotient, expressed in formal action by the community stigmatizing the deviant; # Strengthening of the deviant conduct as a reaction to the stigmatizing and penalties, and; # Ultimate acceptance of deviant and social status and efforts at adjustment on the basis of the associated role.  Secondary Deviance in Culture and Society  = Japan = In Japan the punitive sanctions tend to be more important. The conditions in prison are harsh and some of the interrogated offenders have their rights disregarded. However, Japan has decreased their criminal recidivism rate. Criminal Recidivism is repetition of criminal behavior by an offender previously convicted and punished for an offence. It is also a measure of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs or the deterrent effect of punishment. Explaining recidivism in the U.S, the labeling or secondary deviance perspective has some merit to go with it. Individuals in both countries have common point of views that are unique to their own cultures. As part of the individualism enforced in the United States, individuals are taught to seek self-importance and personal autonomy. One learns that he or she is not supposed to submit to others but should always try to ascend above and beyond others. The offender surfaces in the weak relationship built between the individual and the society in which it requires them to accept authority. The offender is usually prepared to test their social power and have a negative response in order to prove that they are still more important than society itself. Opposite to the conventional labeling perspective which is said to promote secondary deviance, social reaction actually provides for aggravating secondary deviance. In Japan, an individual appreciates the society in which he was born and raised. That tendency comes from what is learned culturally about integration with the society. The social reaction towards offenders in Japan has slighter recidivist consequences rather than in the United States.

Prominent Sociologist Edwin Lemert Lemert, Edwin. 1967. Human Deviance, Social Problems and Social Control. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall conceptualized primary deviance as engaging in the initial act of deviance. This is very common throughout society, as everyone takes part in basic form violation.O'Grady, William. 2011. Crime in Canadian Context. Ontario: Oxford University Press Primary deviance does not result in a person internalizing a deviant identity, so one does not alter their self-concept to include this deviant identity. It is not until the act becomes labeled or tagged, that secondary deviation may materialize. According to Edwin Lemert, Primary Deviance is the acts that are carried out by the individual that allows them to carry the deviant label.  Influences on Primary Deviant Behavior  = Family and home life = Parental support and the influence that Parents have on their children is one of the highest contributors to the behavior in adolescents. This is the primary stage in which behaviors, morals and values are learned and adopted. The guidance from parents is intended to mold and shape the behaviors that will qualify them to properly function in society. Praises, love, affection, encouragement and many other aspects of positive enforcement is one of the largest components of parental support. However, this is not all it takes to prevent deviant behaviors from forming and occurring. Parents must enforce \\"effective discipline, monitoring, and problem-solving techniques.\\" Children who come from homes where parents do not enforce positive behaviors and do not punish deviant behaviors appropriately, are children who are likely to engage in deviant behaviors. This type of bond is considered weak and cause the child to act out become deviant.\\" = Peers = Strong bonds with Parents is essential to the social group that the child will choose to associate with. When there is little to no control in the home, no positive enforcement from Parents, and the child does not have positive feelings towards schooling and education; they are more likely to associate with deviant peers. When associating with deviant peers, they are more accepting of deviant behaviors than if the child chose another social group. This is why it is vital the Parent-Child bond is strong because it will have an ultimate influence on the peers they choose and will have an influence on if they choose to engage in primary deviant behaviors as a juvenile.  Sociological contributors  = Frank Tannenbaum = thumb _Frank Tannenbaum_ Frank Tannenbaum, theorized that Primary Deviant behaviors may be innocent or fun for those committing the act, but can become a nuisance and viewed as some form of delinquency to their parents, educators and even those in law enforcement. Tannenbaum distinguished two different types of deviancy. The first one being the initial act which the child considers to be of innocence but are labeled as deviant by the adult, this label is called Primary Deviancy. The second is after they've been initially labeled that they graduate to Secondary deviance in which both the adult and child agree that they are a deviant. Tannenbaum stated that the \\"over dramatization\\" of these deviant acts can cause one to be labeled and accept the label of being a deviant. Due to them accepting this label, they will eventually graduate from being a primary deviant to a secondary deviant thus committing greater crimes.  Theoretical approaches  = Labeling Theory = _George Herbert Mead_ The most prevalent theory as it relates to Primary Deviance was developed in the early 1960s by a group of sociologists and was titled Labeling theory. The Labeling theory is a variant of Symbolic interactionism. Symbolic interactionism is \\"a theoretical approach in sociology developed by the famous George Herbert Mead. It emphasizes the roles of symbols and language as core elements of human interaction. Labeling theory according to Labeling Theorists; is applied by those put in place to keep law and order, such as Police Officers, Judges; etc. Those are the people who typically label the people who have violated some law or another. The label 'Deviant' does not come from the person who has committed the act,but someone who is more powerful than the person being labeled. This theory has been tremendously criticized for not being able to explain what causes deviance early on. However, The Labeling Theory's main focus is to explain how Labeling relates and can cause Secondary deviance. = Anomie Theory = Robert Merton developed the Anomie Theory which was dedicated specifically to the causes of deviance. The word Anomie was derived from the 'Godfather of Sociology' Emile Durkheim. Anomie is \\"the breakdown of social norms that results from society's urging people to be ambitious but failing to provide them with legitimate opportunities to succeed\\" . Merton theorized that society places substantial emphasis on the importance of achieving success. However, this goal is not attainable for people of all social classes.Due to the absence of resources for people of lower social classes to achieve a great level of success, Merton theorized that people are forced to commit deviant acts. Merton has labeled the deviants behavior's as Innovation = Social Learning Theory = The Social Learning theory theorizes that deviant behavior is learned through Social Interactions with other people. Edwin Sutherland developed an explanation for this theory which explains how one learns deviant behavior. This explanation is called differential association. =Differential Association= Differential Association theorizes that \\"If an individual associates with people who hold deviant ideas more than with people who embrace conventional ideas, the individual is likely to become deviant.\\" The person that is presenting the deviant act isn't always necessarily the deviant. The emphasis of differential association is that if someone is presented with the opportunity they will likely commit the act.Although some one may associate with both deviants and those who hold conventional ideas, if the deviant contacts outweigh the conventional contacts then deviancy is likely to occur. Differential Association's main key point refers particularly to the association aspect. Differential Association is theorized to be \\"the cause of deviance.  Example of Primary Deviance  = Charles Manson = Charles Miles Manson A person who was labeled as deviant was the infamous murderer Charles Manson. Manson was born to a 16 year old Kathleen Maddox on November 12, 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Manson's Father, Colonel Scott left Manson's mother to raise him alone. When Charles was seven years old, he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia after his mother was sentenced to 5 years in prison for armed robbery. Living with his aunt and uncle, Manson was given a more stable life that could allow him to be a positive contributor to society. However, the absence of his mother and the yearning he had for that motherly love and affection caused Manson to indulge in primary deviant behavior at a young age, which ultimately manifested into secondary deviance as he became older. Following the counsel of another uncle, a \\"mountain man\\" who lived in the mountains of Kentucky, Manson labeled himself a rebel. Manson's first act of deviancy began at the age of 9 years old when he set his school on fire and was sent to reform school. Throughout his adolescent, Manson was sent to several reform schools in hopes of rehabilitating him. Between 1942 and 1947 after her release from prison, Manson's mother was unable to properly care for him and was unsuccessful in finding him a foster home. She turned him over to the courts and allowed them to place him in an all boys school called Gibault School for Boys. Ten months later, Manson ran away from the Gibault School for Boys in hopes of rekindling a relationship he had longed for with his mother. After she rejected him Manson turned to a life of deviancy. Manson thrived off of high-consensus deviant acts such as burglary and theft. Manson was then sent to Father Flanagan's Boys' Home in 1949. After 4 days at Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, Manson ran away and pursued other deviant acts; such as auto theft, burglary, and armed robbery. Manson ran away 18 times from the National Training School for Boys where he alleged he was molested and beaten. This behavior in Manson's early years, caused this label of deviant to shadow him through his adult life, where he eventually graduated to Secondary deviance and eventually led the dangerous cult The Manson Family.

Fred Gardner is an American political organizer and author best known for his opposition to the Vietnam War and his writings about the medical mariijuana movement in the United States. Biography Gardner received his bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1963. He has been an editor at Scientific American and Ramparts, a private detective, a songwriter, an author, a freelance journalist, one of the credited screenwriters for Zabriskie Point directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, the owner of Variety Home Video, the editor of Synapse (the UCSF Medical Center weekly), Public Information Officer for the San Francisco District Attorney's office, and the editor of O'Shaughnessy's Journal of Cannabis in Clinical Practice. In the fall of 1967 Gardner, with Donna Mickleson and Deborah Rossman, started a coffeehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, that became a hang-out for GIs, an alternative USO called the UFO (United Freedom Organization). Gardner covered the court martial of 27 GIs charged with mutiny at the Presidio of San Francisco in October 1968 and wrote a book about the case, The Unlawful Concert, published by Viking in 1970 and reissued by Gryphon Press in 2005. In April 1970, Gardner worked as a stage manager for Free The Army (FTA) tour with actors Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland. This traveling road show for soldiers was meant to counter USO shows put on by Bob Hope. As a journalist in the 1970s, Gardner helped break the story that the US government was funding the spraying of paraquat by helicopter to defoliate Mexican marijuana fields. Farmers had been harvesting plants before the poison could work, selling it, and US consumers were inhaling paraquat-laced pot. Gardner also helped expose the hidden ownership of Erhard Seminars Training, and Eli Lilly’s strategy of marketing Prozac by publicizing the prevalence of clinical depression. In 1999, he foresaw and wrote about the medical and political significance of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound in cannabis that may have diverse medical benefits. O’Shaughnessy’s was launched by Gardner in 2003 at the urging of Tod Mikuriya, founder of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians. It is distributed by SCC doctors to their patients. An offshoot of O’Shaughnessy’s, Project CBD, expedited demand for and production of CBD-dominant cannabis in the U.S. Gardner is a frequent and long-time contributor to CounterPunch and the Anderson Valley Advertiser. Gardner currently lives in Alameda, California with his wife Marci. He has six sons and a daughter.

On 25 September 1998, an explosion took place at the plant, killing two workers and injuring eight. Gas supplies to the state of Victoria were severely affected for two weeks. Context In 1998, the Longford gas plant was owned by a joint partnership between Esso and BHP. Esso was responsible for the operation of the plant. Esso was a wholly owned subsidiary of US based company Exxon, which has since merged with Mobil, becoming ExxonMobil. BHP has since merged with UK based Billiton becoming BHP Billiton. Built in 1969, the plant at Longford is the onshore receiving point for oil and natural gas output from production platforms in Bass Strait. The Longford Gas Plant Complex consists of three gas processing plants and one crude oil stabilisation plant. It was the primary provider of natural gas to Victoria, and provided some supply to New South Wales. Normal processing procedure The feed from the Bass Strait platforms consists of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, water (H2O) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The water and H2S are removed before reaching the plant, leaving a hydrocarbon stream to be the feed to Gas Plant 1. This stream contained both gaseous and liquid components. The liquid component was known as \\"condensate\\". The LPG is further extracted by means of a shell and tube heat exchanger, in which heated \\"lean oil\\" and cold \\"rich oil\\" (oil which has absorbed LPG) are pumped into the exchanger, cooling the lean oil and heating the rich oil. Explosion at Longford During the morning of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump supplying heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due to an increase in flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the absorber. (The plant was complex and the hot oil pump was only one component involved in the accident process; why the pump shut down is complicated and important.) A heat exchanger is a vessel that allows the transfer of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single temperature, but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60 °C to 230 °C (140 °F to 446 °F). Investigators estimated that, due to the failure of the lean oil pump, parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as . Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume pumping heated lean oil in to thaw it. When the lean oil pump resumed operation, it pumped oil into the heat exchanger at —the temperature differential caused a brittle fracture in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm. About 10 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon vapour were immediately vented from the rupture. A vapour cloud formed and drifted downwind. When it reached a set of heaters 170 metres away, it ignited. This caused a deflagration (a burning vapour cloud). The flame front burnt its way through the vapour cloud, without causing an explosion. When the flamefront reached the rupture in the heat exchanger, a fierce jet fire developed that lasted for two days. The rupture of GP905 led to other releases and minor fires. The main fire was an intense jet fire emanating from GP905. There was no blast wave—the nearby control room was undamaged. Damage was localised to the immediate area around and above the GP905 exchanger. Peter Wilson and John Lowery were killed in the accident and eight others were injured. Aftermath The fire at the plant was not extinguished until two days later. The Longford plant was shut down immediately, and the state of Victoria was left without its primary gas supplier. Within days, VENCorp shut down the state's entire gas supply. The resulting gas supply shortage was devastating to Victoria's economy, crippling industry and the commercial sector (in particular, the hospitality industry which relied on natural gas for cooking). Loss to industry during the crisis was estimated at around A$1.3 billion. As natural gas was also widely used in houses in Victoria for cooking, water heating and home heating, many Victorians endured 20 days without gas, hot-water or heating. Gas supplies to Victoria resumed on 14 October. Many Victorians were outraged and upset to discover only minor compensation on their next gas bill, with the average compensation figure being only around $10. Royal Commission A Royal Commission was called into the explosion at Longford, headed by former High Court judge Daryl Dawson. The Commission sat for 53 days, commencing with a preliminary hearing on 12 November 1998 and concluding with a closing address by Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission on 15 April 1999. Esso blamed the accident on worker negligence, in particular Jim Ward, one of the panel workers on duty on the day of the explosion. The findings of the Royal Commission, however, cleared Ward of any negligence or wrongdoing. Instead, the Commission found Esso fully responsible for the accident: :The causes of the accident on 25 September 1998 amounted to a failure to provide and maintain so far as practicable a working environment that was safe and without risks to health. This constituted a breach or breaches of Section 21 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985. Other findings of the Royal Commission included: *the Longford plant was poorly designed, and made isolation of dangerous vapours and materials very difficult; *inadequate training of personnel in normal operating procedures of a hazardous process; *excessive alarm and warning systems had caused workers to become desensitised to possible hazardous occurrences; *the relocation of plant engineers to Melbourne had reduced the quality of supervision at the plant; *poor communication between shifts meant that the pump shutdown was not communicated to the following shift. Certain managerial shortcomings were also identified: *the company had neglected to commission a HAZOP (HAZard and OPerability) analysis of the heat exchange system, which would almost certainly have highlighted the risk of tank rupture caused by sudden temperature change; *Esso's two-tiered reporting system (from operators to supervisors to management) meant that certain warning signs such as a previous similar incident (on 28 August) were not reported to the appropriate parties; *the company's safety culture was more oriented towards preventing lost time due to accidents or injuries, rather than protection of workers and their health. Legal ramifications Esso was taken to the Supreme Court of Victoria by the Victorian WorkCover Authority. The jury found the company guilty of eleven breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985, and Justice Philip Cummins imposed a record fine of $2 million in July 2001. In addition, a class action was taken on behalf of businesses, industries and domestic users who were financially affected by the gas crisis. The class action went to trial in the Supreme Court on 4 September 2002, and was eventually settled in December 2004 when Esso was ordered to pay $32.5 million to businesses which suffered property damage as a result of the incident. Following the Longford accident, Victoria introduced Major Hazard FacilitiesMajor Hazard Facilities www.legislation.vic.gov.au regulations to regulate safety at plants that contain major chemical hazards. These regulations impose a so-called \\"non-prescriptive\\" regime on facility operators, requiring them to \\"demonstrate\\" control of major chemical hazards via the use of a Safety Management System and a Safety Case. Other states have also implemented similar regulatory regimes. See also * List of explosions References ;Notes *Hopkins, Andrew.

He also operated for several years in the United States. He is often depicted as the \\"boss of bosses\\", although such a position does not exist in the loose structure of Cosa Nostra in Sicily. Cascio Ferro's life is full of myth and mystery. He became a legend even when he was alive, and that legend is partially responsible for creating the image of the gallant gentleman capomafia (Mafia boss).Servadio, Mafioso, pp. 57–63 He is widely considered to have been responsible for the 1909 murder of Joseph Petrosino, head of the New York City police department's Italian Squad. However, he was never convicted of the crime. With the rise of Fascism in Italy, his untouchable position declined. He was arrested and sentenced to death in 1930 and would remain in jail until his death. There is some confusion about the exact year of his death, but according to La Stampa, Cascio Ferro died on 20 September 1943, in the prison on the island of Procida. Early life The U.S. Treasury department used the spelling \\"Cascioferro\\" on this 1902 arrest sheet, though most other sources spell the name as \\"Cascio Ferro\\". Although many sources have identified him as a native of the rural town of Bisacquino, where he was raised, he was actually born in the city of Palermo.Marino, I Padrini, pp. 76-114 His parents, Accursio Cascio Ferro and Santa Ippolito, were poor and illiterate.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, p. 48 The family moved to Bisacquino when his father became a campiere (an armed guard) with the local landlord, Baron Antonino Inglese, a notorious usurper of state-owned land. The position of campiere often involved Mafiosi. Petacco, Joe Petrosino, p. 101-03 According to other sources, at an early age, the family moved to Sambuca Zabut, where he lived for approximately 24 years before relocating to Bisacquino, his recognized power base in the Mafia.Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America, pp. 39-41 Cascio Ferro never went to any school. When still young, Cascio Ferro married a teacher from Bisacquino, Brigida Giaccone, who instructed him how to read and write. He was inducted into the Mafia in the 1880s.The Murder of Joe Petrosino, The New York Press, November 19, 2002 He worked as a revenue collector as a young adult, using the position as a cover to carry out his protection racket.Biography of Vito Cascio Ferro on The American Mafia (Sources: \\"Petrosino Slayer may be in custody\\" April 7, 1909; \\"Told a story of Petrosino murder\\" December 29, 1912; \\"The origin of organized crime\\" by David Critchley; \\"The history of the Sicilian Mafia\\" by John Dickie) His criminal record began with an assault in 1884 and progressed through extortion, arson, and menacing, and eventually to the kidnapping of the 19-year-old Baroness Clorinda Peritelli di Valpetrosa in June 1898, Il sequestro della baronessina Valpetroso, La Stampa, August 18, 1899 for which he received a three-year sentence. Don Vito, da rivoluzionario a boss, La Sicilia, February 27, 2005 Revolutionary mafioso While incarcerated for attempted extortion, Cascio Ferro was recruited into the Fasci Siciliani (Sicilian Leagues), a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration, by Bernardino Verro, the president of the League in Corleone. The Leagues needed muscle in their social struggle of 1893–94.Revolutionary Mafiosi: Voice and Exit in the 1890s, by John Alcorn, in: Paolo Viola & Titti Morello (eds.), L'associazionismo a Corleone: Un'inchiesta storica e sociologica (Istituto Gramsci Siciliano, Palermo, 2004) Cascio Ferro became the president of the Fascio of Bisacquino.Lupo, History of the Mafia, pp. 146–49 In January 1894, the Fasci were outlawed and brutally repressed on the orders of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. Many leaders were put in jail; Cascio Ferro fled to Tunis for a year. After serving his sentence for his role in the peasant unrest, Cascio Ferro returned to a position of social power and pressured authorities in Palermo to put him in charge of granting emigration permits in the district of Corleone. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo, Cascio Ferro was involved in clandestine emigration networks. In the United States Giuseppe Morello founded and led the Morello Gang, which is recognized as the first Mafia family in New York Sentenced for the kidnapping of the Baroness of Valpetrosa in 1898, Cascio Ferro was released in 1900. To escape special police surveillance in Sicily, he sailed to the United States and arrived in New York City at the end of September 1901. He lived for about 2 years in New York, acting as an importer of fruits and foods. He also spent six months in New Orleans. On 21 May 1902, Cascio Ferro was arrested in connection with a large counterfeiting operation in Hackensack, New Jersey. He was arrested at the barbershop of Giuseppe Romano on First Avenue, from which the counterfeit money had been distributed. Cascio Ferro managed to escape conviction--his alibi was that he worked at a paper mill--while the other gang members were tried and sentenced. In New York, he became associated with the Morello gang in Harlem, headed by Giuseppe Morello and Ignazio Lupo.Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America, p. 51 In September 1904, he returned to Sicily shortly after police sergeant Joseph Petrosino of the New York City Police Department ordered his arrest for involvement with the Barrel Murder; his application for American citizenship was consequently blocked. Petrosino traced him to New Orleans, where Cascio Ferro had gone to escape detection, but he had already slipped away. Some observers consider Cascio Ferro as the one who brought the extortion practice of \\"continuing protection\\" in exchange for protection money (pizzo) from Sicily to the United States. \\"You have to skim the cream off the milk without breaking the bottle,\\" he summarized the system. \\"Don't throw people into bankruptcy with ridiculous demands for money. Offer them protection instead, help them to make their business prosperous, and not only will they be happy to pay but they'll kiss your hands out of gratitude.\\" Back in Sicily Mafia boss Vito Cascio Ferro with his son and a hunting dog. Back in Sicily, Cascio Ferro rose to the position of a local notable. He was the capo elettore (ward heeler) of Domenico De Michele Ferrantelli, the mayor of Burgio and member of Parliament for the district of Bivona, as well as on good terms with the Baron Inglese. He exercised influence over several Mafia cosche (clans) in the towns of Bisacquino, Burgio, Campofiorito, Chiusa Sclafani, Contessa Entellina, Corleone, and Villafranca Sicula, as well as some districts in the city of Palermo.Biography of Vito Cascio Ferro on GangRule.com (accessed October 16, 2010) A semi- factual and romantic portrait by journalist Luigi Barzini contributed much to form the legend of Don Vito: > Don Vito brought the organization to its highest perfection without undue > recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the > island in order to achieve his goal is considered as inept as the statesman > who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by > the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring > appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but > majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never > refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general > philanthropy. He would personally go out of his way to redress a wrong. When > he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him > at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, as if he > were a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order > were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official > law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to > draw too fine a distinction.Barzini, The Italians, p. 291 Police reports described Cascio Ferro as notoriously associated with the \\"high\\" Mafia, leading a life of luxury, going to the theater, cafés, gambling high sums at the Circolo dei Civili a club for gentlemen, reserved for those with pretensions to education and elite status. The Petrosino murder New York City police officer Joseph Petrosino Cascio Ferro is considered to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, Joseph Petrosino, on 12 March 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants.Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America, pp. 68-69Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 209-11 The two men were very much aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascio Ferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascio Ferro had a photograph of the police officer. Many accounts claim that Cascio Ferro personally killed Petrosino. Legend has it that Cascio Ferro excused himself from a dinner party among the high society at the home of his political patron De Michele Ferrantelli, took a carriage (that of his host according to some), and drove to Piazza Marina in Palermo's city centre. He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascio Ferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again.For a romanticized version of Cascio Ferro's life, see The Sun King of The Mafia on Gangsters Inc. Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascio Ferro at the scene of the crime. News of the murder spread fast in U.S. newspapers and a swell of anti-Italian sentiment spread across New York. Cascio Ferro pleaded his innocence and provided an alibi for the entire period when Petrosino was assassinated. He stayed in the house of De Michele Ferrantelli in Burgio. However, the alibi provided by De Michele Ferrantelli was suspicious, taking into account the relation between the two. Moreover, while in jail after his arrest and life sentence in 1930, Cascio Ferro apparently claimed that he had killed Petrosino. According to writer Arrigo Petacco in his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino, Cascio Ferro said: \\"In my whole life I have killed only one person, and I did that disinterestedly … Petrosino was a brave adversary, and deserved better than a shameful death at the hands of some hired cut-throat.\\"Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 18 alt= A report by Baldassare Ceola, the police commissioner of Palermo, concluded that the crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascio Ferro's direction.Lt. Petrosino Murder, GangRule.com (accessed October 16, 2010)Petrosino's Slayer May Be In Custody, The New York Times, April 7, 1909 Evidence was thin, however, and the case was effectively closed when in July 1911 the Palermo Court of Appeals discharged Cascio Ferro, as well as Costantino and Passananti, due to insufficient evidence to send them to trial. Petrosino's murder was never solved. Nevertheless, Costantino and Passananti were identified as the most likely assassins. Costantino died in the late 1930s and Passananti, in March 1969.Dash, The First Family, p. 300 In 2014, more than a century after the assassination, the Italian police overheard a tapped phone conversation in which a sibling claimed that Paolo Palazzotto had been the killer on the orders of Cascio Ferro. Palazzotto had been arrested after the shooting, but had been released for lack of evidence. Boss svela chi uccise Joe Petrosino, Ansa, June 23, 2014 Colpo alla nuova Cupola: 91 arresti. Una cimice svela dopo 100 anni gli assassini di Joe Petrosino, La Repubblica, June 23, 2014Italy police 'solve' 1909 Petrosino Mafia murder, BBC News, June 23, 2014 In a recorded conversation during an (unrelated) investigation by Italian police the suspected Mafia boss, Domenico Palazzotto, told other mafiosi that his great-uncle had killed Petrosino on behalf of Cascio Ferro.Italian police 'solve' suspected mafia killing of US detective in 1909, The Guardian, 23 June 2014 Downfall In 1923, the sub- prefect of Corleone warned the Ministry of Interior that Cascio Ferro was \\"one of the worst offenders, quite capable of committing any crime.\\" In May 1925, he was arrested as the instigator of a murder. He was able to be released on bail, as usual. However, with the rise of Fascism, his reputation and immunity was declining. In May 1926, Prefect Cesare Mori, under orders from Fascist leader Benito Mussolini to destroy the Mafia, arrested Cascio Ferro in a big round-up in the area that included Corleone and Bisacquino. More than 150 people were arrested. Cascio Ferro's godson asked the local landlord to intervene, but he refused: \\"Times have changed\\", was the reply.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 185-86 He was indicted for participation in 20 murders, eight attempted murders, five robberies with violence, 37 acts of extortion, and 53 other offences including physical violence and threats.Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, p. 51 He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 27 June 1930, on the old murder charge. He remained silent during the trial. Cascio Ferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascio Ferro if he had something to say in his defense. Cascio Ferro stood up and said: \\"Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed.\\"Blood, Business, Honor, Time Magazine, October 15, 1984 The \\"iron prefect\\", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascio Ferro and the text of the court sentence. Death and legacy There is uncertainty about the exact date of his death. The most common account is that he died of natural causes in 1945 while serving his sentence at Ucciardone prison in Palermo. Italian author Petacco found evidence for his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino that Cascio Ferro may have died of dehydration in the summer of 1943. According to Petacco, Cascio Ferro was left behind in his cell by prison guards while other inmates were evacuated in advance of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Petacco, Joe Petrosino, p. 207 However, according to historian Giuseppe Carlo Marino, Cascio Ferro was transferred to another prison in Pozzuoli in 1940, and the octogenarian was left to die during an Allied bombardment of that prison in 1943 (other sources mention 1942). According to La Stampa, Cascio Ferro died on 20 September 1943, in the prison on the island of Procida. \\"Joe Petrosino ha offeso l'onore del padre mio\\", La Stampa, January 30, 1973 For years, a sentence believed to be carved by Cascio Ferro was legible on the wall of his Ucciardone cell: \\"Prison, sickness, and necessity, reveal the real heart of a man.\\" Inmates considered occupying Don Vito's former cell a great honour.Barzini, The Italians, p. 292 Historians consider this account a legend rather than fact.

The mall is currently anchored by Nordstrom, JCPenney, DSW, and two Macy's locations. There are additional smaller notable stores including Michel Kors, Brooks Brothers, Bancroft & Co., Victoria's Secret and The Cheesecake Factory. The mall is in size,(including anchors) and most of this space is located on one level, with the exception of the Nordstrom wing and most anchor stores. Previous anchors include Sears, Jordan Marsh, Filene's, and Lord & Taylor. The former Jordan Marsh store was four stories, until it was demolished to make way for the Nordstrom wing. The mall is currently managed by Simon Property Group, who owns 56.4% of it, and is less than a mile away from Simon's Liberty Tree Mall. History The interior of Northshore Mall Plans for Greater Boston's second shopping mall were formally announced in December 1954. A $10 million retail complex was to be built on 100 acres, located 18 miles northeast of Boston, in suburban Peabody. The site had previously been a country estate. Later, it contained St. Joseph's Juniorate, a parochial school, and a dairy farm with gardens. Originally, the center had been planned for Beverly instead. The Northshore Shopping Center opened with a dedication ceremony on September 12, 1958 as an open-air shopping center. Then-Governor of Massachusetts Foster Furcolo (D) cut the ceremonial ribbon. It was anchored by Jordan Marsh, an adjoining Filene's, and included Sears, Kresge, J.J. Newberry, RH Stearns, and Stop & Shop. Recreational facilities at the time included a bowling alley, a cinema, and a small amusement park called Kiddietown, next to the former Sears & Roebuck, where Office Depot is now located. The shopping center went through several changes in the 1970s and 1980s, including the expansion of Sears to a full- line anchor. Starting with a small section near the Sears store, the entire outside shopping center was enclosed to better compete with nearby Liberty Tree Mall, constructed by New England Development in 1972. In 1992, Northshore Mall was acquired by New England Development, which expanded the mall to almost 1.7 million ft². On the northwest end of the mall, Filene's built a replacement store where the amusement park once was, while Lord & Taylor also constructed a new store at this end of the mall as well. Both stores had their opening in 1993. A new food court was added adjoining the original Filene's location, which was gutted and rebuilt for the addition of JCPenney. In 1999, New England Development sold the mall to a joint venture led by Simon Property Group, which also assumed management of the center. Since then there have been many smaller cosmetic upgrades and a few structural changes increasing the size. The shopping center has been home to the St. Therese Society of Mt. Carmel Chapel since 1960. It is one of few chapels to be located inside of a shopping center. The mall also houses the Peabody Police Department Community Outreach Center. On September 1, 2001, the Apple Store opened. The shopping center was chosen by Apple as its first store in the Northeastern United States. When the Apple Store opened, which was located by the new Nordstrom Wing, it was the 6th Apple Store to ever open in the world. On January 27, 2017, Apple moved the store to a new open-air shopping plaza, MarketStreet Lynnfield. Except for the renaming of Jordan Marsh to Macy's in 1996, the mall's structure and anchors remained intact until 2005, when May Department Stores (parent of Lord & Taylor and Filene's at the time) was acquired by Federated Department Stores (the owner of Macy's). In March 2006, Federated briefly closed the Filene's store, before using the space to relocate its Macy's store that May, as part of the brand's merger into Macy's. In June 2006, Simon announced an agreement with Nordstrom to open at the mall sometime in 2009. Plans called for demolishing the former Jordan Marsh to clear space for an expansion, anchored by the new Nordstrom store. Due to this increased competition, Federated announced plans to convert the Lord & Taylor store into a Macy's Mens & Home store. The new wing opened on November 4, 2009. Unlike the rest of the mall, it has stores on two floors, both of which connect to and have access to Nordstrom. The food court entrance was also renovated and expanded, with the additions of The Cheesecake Factory, which opened in October 2007, and P.F. Chang's China Bistro, which opened in early 2009. The P.F. Chang's restaurant closed in 2017 and Bancroft & Co. currently occupies the space. In 2017, renovations began outside the mall to add two new restaurants, Bancroft & Co. and Tony C's Sports Bar and Grill, and an outdoor stage for community events and performances. Other additions include two additional fast-casual restaurants, a new patio and landscape, and renovations to the food court and restrooms. This new area is called The Promenade. On June 29, 2018, Toys \\"R\\" Us closed as part of the chain's liquidation. The store shared a 63,000-square-foot building, built in 1994 on the former Sears & Roebuck site, with an Ulta Beauty cosmetic store, according to city records. The toy store rented about 45,000 square feet, and its space is valued at $4.9 million. In February 2019, the former Toys \\"R\\" Us spot would be the new home of the PGA Tour Superstore golf shop. On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing its 450,000 square foot store as part of a plan to close 78 stores nationwide. The store closed on September 2, 2018, just ten days shy of the mall's 60th anniversary. The Sears building, completed in 1978, was demolished in February 2019. Site work is ongoing to prepare for construction. At this time the hallways that accessed Sears are closed and stores occupying them have been temporarily relocated. Health club chain Life Time Inc., which has locations in Burlington and Chestnut Hill, plans to build a standalone three-story health club adjacent to the Sears site. Simon is also planning to add new restaurants, a new main entrance and begin to add a second floor to the mall and a third floor over the Nordstrom wing. The first two projects are expected to be complete by 2020. The second floor project is still in planning and approval stages but is expected to be complete by 2035. Incidents *On August 29, 2015, a chef from P.F. Chang's China Bistro was arrested after allegedly stabbing his co-worker to death at the restaurant. The incident occurred at about 5:30 p.m., just as the dinner rush began. Jaquan Huston, 23, was charged with first degree murder in the fatal stabbing of Elivelton Dias, 38, of Salem. Dias was taken to Salem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. “Tonight we lost an employee in a tragic incident at our Peabody restaurant. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of our colleague,” P.F. Chang's said in a statement. \\"We will be mobilizing support to provide care to our colleague’s family, as well as our fellow employees, during this difficult time.

Polleras are made from different materials, such as cotton or wool and tend to have colorful decorations. Most of the decorations are embroidered, flowers and regional animals are among the most common designs found in polleras. Polleras are a form of Spanish colonial dress enforced sometime between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on indigenous populations in the Andes by hacienda owners or hacendados. Traditional polleras come from peasant dress from southern Spanish regions, like Andalusia. Today, polleras are associated with indigenous and folkloric forms of dress. Spain In Spain skirt worn by women almost a century ago. They are made of wool or cotton and are very colorful. The large gathered skirt is generally white with two or three ruffles which have a floral design or embroidery. The top has several ruffles as well on the shoulders and has inlaid yarn. There is a large pompom matching the yarn in the front and back of the top. The yarn also matches several large ribbons at the waist and the slippers that go with the outfit. The clothing includes a headdress called a tembleque (or tembeleque) which is made of beads attached to a spring so that they tremble when the wearer dances. Panama alt= In Panama, handmade polleras are worn during festivals or celebrations. They are mainly made of cotton and wool. Normally, dominant color is white, and adornments are colorful flower designs. Girls and women would generally own two polleras during their life: one before age 16 and one at adulthood. Panamanian Polleras A single pollera can cost from several hundred to several thousands of dollars and take up to a year to create. The gold and pearl mosquetas and tembleques that provides a pollera are generally passed down as heirlooms through generations. Bolivia and Peru In Bolivia and Peru the word pollera denotes a pleated skirt very much associated with the urban mestizo and the rural indigenous classes where women usually wear this garment (nowadays also instead of the woven indigenous dresses). The urban pollera typical of the Bolivian altiplano should be made of 8 meters of cloth and it is worn with 4-5 embroidered underskirts, which gives the Cholitas (mestizo women who wear the pollera) some \\"round\\" lookings. The skirt worn under the top pollera is called the fuste, under the fuste (in the third skirt) is typically made from wool. There are still quite a lot of women around who wear this skirt which originates from the Spanish rural dresses and for the Carnaval de Oruro or Virgen de la Candelaría festival in Peru, and other festivities. During traditional festivities women who don't usually wear it, put it on for the dancing.

The canonical book of Acts ends rather abruptly with Paul kept under house arrest in chapter 28, which has led to various theories about the history of the text. History The text made its first appearance in London in 1871. According to the editor, it was translated in the late 18th century by the French naturalist Sonnini de Manoncourt from a \\"Greek manuscript discovered in the archives at Constantinople and presented to him by the Sultan Abdoul Achmet\\". It was found hidden in an English translation of Sonnini's Voyage en Grèce et en Turquie in the library of Sir John Newport, MP (1756–1843) after his death. However, no trace of any such manuscript has been found, and from internal evidence, mainstream philology considers it to most likely be a fraud, thus it is classed among the modern pseudepigrapha. It is available in a 1982 edition by E. Raymond Capt () from Artisan Publishers, Muskogee, which is a publisher specializing in evangelical fringe subjects. Purpose and influence The purpose of the book was likely to support Anglo-Israelism. The book has not found attention in recent mainstream publications and is not mentioned on the website of the British-Israel-World Federation. The influence of that movement has declined.

Barn paintings, usually in the form of \\"stars in circles\\", began to appear on the landscape in the early 19th century and became widespread decades later when commercial ready-mixed paint became readily available. By the 1950s commercialized hex signs, aimed at the tourist market, became popular and these often include stars, compass roses, stylized birds known as distelfinks, hearts, tulips, or a tree of life. Two schools of thought exist on the meaning of hex signs. One school ascribes a talismanic nature to the signs; the other sees them as purely decorative. Both schools recognize that there are sometimes superstitions associated with certain hex sign themes and neither ascribes strong magical power to them.Richman, p. 53 The Amish do not use hex signs. Form and use Painted barn stars in circular borders are a common sight on Pennsylvania Dutch barns in central and southeastern Pennsylvania, especially in Berks County, Lancaster County and Lehigh County. However, the modern decoration of barns is a late development in Pennsylvania Dutch folk art. Prior to the 1830s, the cost of paint meant that most barns were unpainted. As paint became affordable, the Pennsylvania Dutch began to decorate their barns much like they decorated items in their homes. Barn decorating reached its peak in the early 20th century, at which time there were many artists who specialized in barn decorating. Drawn from a large repertoire of designs barn painters combined many elements in their decorations. The geometric patterns of quilts can be seen in the patterns of many hex signs. Hearts and tulips seen on barns are commonly found on elaborately lettered and decorated birth, baptism and marriage certificates known as fraktur. Throughout the 20th century, hex signs were often produced as commodities for the tourist industry in Pennsylvania. These signs could be bought and then mounted onto barns and used as household decorations. Jacob Zook of Paradise, Pennsylvania, claimed to have originated the modern mountable sign in 1942, based on traditional designs, to be sold in souvenir gift shops to tourists along the Lincoln Highway. Edward Buchak, of Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania designed and produced many Jacob Zook signs via screen printing. William Schuster, Milton Hill, Johnny Ott, and Johnny and Eric Claypoole also contributed to this hex sign revival or adaptation.Richman pp. 53-54 Modern artists may stress the symbolic meanings, for example, a horse head is used to protect animals from disease and the building from lightning and a dove represents peace and contentment. An unusual use is the official logo of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Radiation Protection, which incorporates the international symbol for radiation into its yellow-and-red adaptation of a traditional hex sign design.

The term hex with occult connotations may derive from the Pennsylvanian German word \\"hex\\" (German \\"Hexe\\", Dutch \\"Heks\\"), meaning \\"witch\\". However, the term \\"hex sign\\" was not used until the 20th century, after 1924 when Wallace Nutting's book Pennsylvania Beautiful was published. Nutting, who was not a Pennsylvania native, interviewed farmers about their distinctive barn decoration. Before this time there was no standardized term and many Pennsylvania German farmers simply called the signs \\"blume\\" or \\"sterne\\" (meaning flowers or stars). However one farmer used the term \\"Hexefoos\\" in his description. The term became popular with Pennsylvania Germans themselves during the blossoming tourist trade of southeastern Pennsylvania. These signs were traditionally ordained with six-pointed stars. There is also the belief that the origin leading to the word \\"hex sign\\" is that English settlers mispronounced the German word for six, \\"sechs\\", as \\"hex\\". In recent years, hex signs have come to be used by non–Pennsylvania Dutch persons as talismans for folk magic rather than as items of decoration. Some believe that both the Pennsylvania German barn design and hex designs originate with the Alpine Germans. They note that hexes are of pre-Christian Germanic origin; for instance, a circled rosette is called the Sun of the Alps in Padania (the Po Valley). Based on this history, neopagans or Germanic heathens have taken up the practice of creating hex signs, incorporating other pre-Christian signs and symbols into the hex work. Gandee, in his book Strange Experience, Autobiography of a Hexenmeister, described hex signs as \\"painted prayers\\".Gandee, pp. 305–320 Some view the designs as decorative symbols of ethnic identification, possibly originating in reaction to 19th century attempts made by the government to suppress the Pennsylvania German language. Anabaptist sects (like the Amish and Mennonites) in the region have a negative view of hex signs. It is not surprising that hex signs are rarely, and perhaps never, seen on an Amish or Mennonite household or farm.

Powered speakers are used in a range of settings, including in sound reinforcement systems (used at live music concerts), both for the main speakers facing the audience and the monitor speakers facing the performers; by DJs performing at dance events and raves; in private homes as part of hi-fi or home cinema audio systems and as computer speakers. They can be connected directly to a mixing console or other low-level audio signal source without the need for an external amplifier. Some active speakers designed for sound reinforcement system use have an onboard mixing console and microphone preamplifier, which enables microphones to be connected directly to the speaker. Active speakers have several advantages, the most obvious being their compactness and simplicity. Additionally the amplifier(s) can be designed to closely match the optimal requirements of the speaker it will power; and the speaker designer is not required to include a passive crossover, decreasing production cost and possibly sound quality. Some also claim that the shorter distances between components can decrease external interference and increase fidelity; although this is highly dubious, and the reciprocal argument can also be made. Disadvantages include heavier loudspeaker enclosures; reduced reliability due to active electronic components within; and the need to supply both the audio signal and power to every unit separately, typically requiring two cables to be run to each speaker (as opposed to the single cable required with passive speakers and an external amplifier). Powered speakers are available with passive or active crossovers built into them. Since the early 2000s, powered speakers with active crossovers and other DSP have become common in sound reinforcement applications and in studio monitors. Home theater and add-on domestic/automotive subwoofers have used active powered speaker technology since the late 1980s.  Differences  A powered computer speaker. The terms \\"powered\\" and \\"active\\" have been used interchangeably in loudspeaker designs, however, a differentiation may be made between the terms: *In a passive loudspeaker system the low-level audio signal is first amplified by an external power amplifier before being sent to the loudspeaker where the signal is split by a passive crossover into the appropriate frequency ranges before being sent to the individual drivers. This design is common in home audio as well as professional concert audio. *A powered loudspeaker works the same way as a passive speaker, but the power amplifier is built into the loudspeaker enclosure. This design is common in compact personal speakers such as those used to amplify portable digital music devices. *In a fully active loudspeaker system each driver has its own dedicated power amplifier. The low- level audio signal is first sent through an active crossover to split the audio signal into the appropriate frequency ranges before being sent to the power amplifiers and then on to the drivers. This design is commonly seen in studio monitors and professional concert audio. Hybrid active designs exist such as having three drivers powered by two internal amplifiers. In this case, an active two-way crossover splits the audio signal, usually into low frequencies and mid-high frequencies. The low-frequency driver is driven by its own amplifier channel while the mid- and high-frequency drivers share an amplifier channel, the output of which is split by a passive two-way crossover. =Integrated active systems= The term \\"active speakers\\" can also refer to an integrated \\"active system\\" in which passive loudspeakers are mated to an external system of multiple amplifiers fed by an active crossover. These active loudspeaker systems may be built for professional concert touring such as the pioneering JM-3 system designed in 1971 by Harry McCune Sound Service,Transcript PSW LIVE CHAT with John Meyer or they may be built for high-end home use such as various systems from Naim Audio and Linn Products. History Some of the first powered loudspeakers were JBL monitor speakers. With the addition of the SE401 Stereo Energizer, introduced in 1964, any pair of monitor speakers could be converted to self-powered operation with the second speaker powered by the first.JBL Solid State Stereo Energizer The first studio monitor with an active crossover was the OY invented 1967 by Klein- Hummel. It was a hybrid three-way design with two internal amplifier channels. An early example of a bi-amplified powered studio monitor is the Altec 9846B, introduced in 1971, which combined the passive 9846-8A speaker with the new 771B Bi-amplifier with 60 watts for the woofer and 30 watts for the high frequency compression driver.Altec 1971 Monitor catalog In the late 1970s, Paramount Pictures contracted with AB Systems to design a powered speaker system. In 1980, Meyer Sound Laboratories produced an integrated active 2-way system, the passive UPA-1, which incorporated lessons John Meyer learned on the McCune JM-3. It used active electronics mounted outside of the loudspeaker enclosure, including Meyer's integrated active crossover with feedback comparator circuits determining the level of limiting, often connected to third-party customer-specified amplifiers. In 1990, Meyer produced its first powered speaker: the HD-1, a 2-way studio monitor with all internal electronics. In the early '90s, after years of dealing with the disadvantages of passive systems, especially varying gain settings on third-party amplifiers, John Meyer decided to stop making passive speakers and devote his company to active designs. Meyer said he \\"hired an ad agency to research how people felt about powered speakers for sound reinforcement, and they came back after a survey and said that nobody wanted them.\\" Sound reinforcement system operators said they did not want loudspeakers in which they could not see the amplifier meters to determine whether the loudspeakers were working properly during a concert. Nevertheless, Meyer kept to his decision and produced the MSL-4 in 1994, the first powered loudspeaker intended for concert touring. The UPA-1 was converted to a self-powered configuration in 1996 and the rest of Meyer's product line followed suit. Advantages and disadvantages =Fidelity= The main benefit of active versus passive speakers is in the higher fidelity associated with active crossovers and multiple amplifiers, including less IMD, higher dynamic range and greater output power. The amplifiers within the loudspeaker enclosure may be ideally matched to the individual drivers, eliminating the need for each amplifier channel to operate in the entire audio bandpass. Driver characteristics such as power handling and impedance may be matched to amplifier capabilities. More specifically, active speakers have very short speaker cables inside the enclosure, so very little voltage and control is lost in long speaker cables with higher resistance. An active speaker often incorporates equalization tailored to each driver's response in the enclosure. This yields a flatter, more neutral sound. Limiting circuits (high-ratio audio compression circuits) can be incorporated to increase the likelihood of the driver surviving high-SPL use. Such limiters may be carefully matched to driver characteristics, resulting in a more dependable loudspeaker requiring less service. Distortion detection may be designed into the electronics to help determine the onset of protective limiting, reducing output distortion and eliminating clipping. =Cabling= Passive speakers need only one speaker cable but active speakers need two cables: an audio signal cable and an AC power cable. For multiple-enclosure high-power concert systems, the AC cabling is often smaller in diameter than the equivalent speaker cable bundles, so less copper is used. Some powered speaker manufacturers are now incorporating UHF or more frequently Wi-Fi wireless receivers so the speaker requires only an AC power cable. =Weight= A powered speaker usually weighs more than an equivalent passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker- level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it is less of a load in rigging (flying). However, active speakers using lightweight Class-D amplifiers have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and loudspeaker enclosures. Overall shipping weight for an active loudspeaker system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter AC cables and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks. =Cost= The expense of a large concert active speaker system is less than the expense of an equivalent passive system. The passive system, or integrated active system with external electronics, requires separate components such as crossovers, equalizers, limiters and amplifiers, all mounted in rolling racks. Cabling for passive concert systems is heavy, large-diameter speaker cable, more expensive than smaller diameter AC power cables and much smaller audio signal cables. For high-end home use, active speakers usually cost more than passive speakers because of the additional amplifier channels required. =Ease of use= In professional audio and some home cinema and hi-fi applications, the active speaker may be easier to use because it eliminates the complexity of properly setting crossover frequencies, equalizer curves and limiter thresholds. Cabling is not as simple, however, because active speakers require two cables instead of one (an AC power cable and a cable with the signal, typically an XLR cable). In home audio, some audio engineers argue that a passive speaker, in which an unpowered speaker is connected to an amplifier, is the easiest to install and operate. Servo-driven speakers By including a negative feedback loop in the amplifier-speaker system, distortion can be substantially reduced. If mounted at the speaker cone, the sensor is usually an accelerometer. It is possible to monitor the back emf generated by the driver voice coil as it moves within the magnetic gap. In either case, specialist amplifier designs are needed and so servo speakers are inherently powered speakers. Bass amplifiers Some bass amplifier manufacturers sell powered speakers designed for adding to the stage power of a combo bass amp. The user plugs a patch cord or XLR cable from the combo amp into the powered speaker.

With offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and Menlo Park, the firm invests in public markets, real estate and venture capital, focusing on companies in the fields of healthcare, financial services, media, and technology. The company was established in December 1999 as Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited, an online gaming company known for publishing and operating games such as The World of Legend and Magical Land. By 2004 Shanda was the largest online game company in China, and its listing on the NASDAQ that year under ticker SNDA was the largest IPO for a Chinese internet company in the United States. Shanda Interactive later diversified and its gaming unit spun off in 2009, raising $1.04 billion in an IPO (GAME). Shanda Group was taken private in 2012 by its founders, and by 2017 it had $8 billion in net assets under management. History =1999-2003: Start in online gaming= Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited was founded in December 1999 by Chen Tianqiao, Chrissy Luo, and Chen Danian. With headquarters in Shanghai, and USD $60,000 in startup capital, the company also raised $3 million to focus on online cartoons, gaming and virtual communities. Settling on online gaming, in 2001 the company used the final $300,000 of its startup funds to buy the Chinese rights to Legend of Mir II, licensing the game from the South Korean company WeMade Soft. Published in China that September, the game began to turn a profit after two months. Expanding out of Shanghai city by city, Shanda Interactive shared its revenue with regional telecommunications companies. Because home internet access in China was limited at the time, Shanda Interactive began constructing a network of around 200,000 internet cafes. The company also began selling pre-paid cards to purchase game time, eventually establishing around 400,000 retail outlets. Shanda continued to license international online games after Mir II, and at the end of 2002 the company had $42 million in revenue and $17 million in net profits, with an average of 280,000 people playing its games simultaneously. Shanda ceased partnering with WeMade in 2003 after a dispute over sharing profits on Legend of Mir 2, developing its own game The World of Legend in-house. WeMade considered the game to be a copy of Mir 2 and sued, reaching a settlement in 2009. =2004-2005: IPO and acquisitions= Legend of Mir 2 and World of Legend accounted for 87.5 percent of Shanda Interactive's revenue in the first quarter of 2004. To reduce dependence on those two games, Shanda released the self-developed game The Sign in February 2004, and by April was also working on the in-house titles Age and Magical Land. Shanda Interactive listed on the NASDAQ in May 2004, raising $152 million with the initial public offering (IPO) under the ticker SNDA and becoming the first Chinese online games company listed in the United States. At the time it was the largest IPO of a Chinese internet company in the United States, and shortly afterwards Shanda became the largest internet company by market capitalization in China. In October 2004 Shanda issued US$275 million convertible notes to be redeemable in October 2007. That month Shanda was operating eight games and hosting 1.2 million simultaneous players. As of May 2005, 300,000 locations, among them 130,000 internet cafes, sold prepaid cards for Shanda's games and game usage was \\"up 70% from a year earlier.\\" Shanda purchased about 20% of Sina.com for $230 million in 2005, becoming Sina's largest shareholder. Operating as an online advertising firm, Sina.com was the most popular internet portal in China at the time. Also that year Shanda purchased the mobile game provider Digital-Red and the literature website Qidian. In 2005, Shanda also began working with search engine Baidu and partnered with Universal Music Group to support music streaming on PCs in China. Shanda revealed two hardware products in October 2005. The EZ mini was a handheld wireless gaming device, while the EZ Center/EZ Pod software for was remote PC control. Shanda employed 2,000 game developers at its headquarters at the end of 2005, and had recently purchased motion-capture equipment to speed the animation process. With six game titles at the time, four of those had been developed in-house. On average, Shanda's revenues doubled each year between 2001 and 2005, and at the end of 2005 it had a market capitalization of $1.8 billion and was China's biggest gaming company. Founder Chen Tianqiao was estimated to have a net worth of $1.45 billion, with the press dubbing him the \\"Chinese Bill Gates.\\" =2005-2007: Free-to-play model= In the summer of 2005, Shanda Interactive's revenue dropped significantly as its old hit Legend of Mir II began to lose subscribers. With the intent of extending the life of its older MMORPGs, in December 2005, Shanda announced that its three major games Magical Land, Woool, and Legend of Mir II would be forever be free to play. Allowing gamers to pay for in-game items instead of subscriptions, the \\"freemium\\" model was then uncommon in China. The change proved controversial in Wall Street and Shanda's share price initially dropped 70%. Shanda defended the change, arguing that free games accounted for most of the top titles in South Korea, a trend which could be replicated in China. It was later revealed that once Shanda's games adopted this model, average customer spending increased from 30 Chinese yuan to 55 Chinese yuan per quarter. Revenue rebounded after about nine months, and in 2006, Shanda Interactive's internet games sales increased 44 percent from the year prior. Shanda Interactive announced in February 2007 that the free-to-play model was proving lucrative, and shares increased 10 percent in value that day. Following Shanda's example, other Chinese online game operators began declaring many of their titles free to play. By 2007, most new games in China were using the freemium model. In July 2006, Motorola announced it would launch wireless versions of Shanda's games in China, with World of Legend and Magical Land to be playable on certain Motorola E680g handsets.https://www.upi.com/Motorola-to-carry-Shanda-wireless- games/30781154105228/ By November 2006, Shanda was expanding from online games into an \\"entertainment empire on the Internet, mobile phones and TVs,\\" according to China Daily. Shanda sold 4 million shares of Sina Corp for $129 million in February 2007. In June 2007, Shanda Interactive signed licensing and distribution agreements to expand World of Legend, Magical Land and Crazy Kart into Vietnam, Hong Kong and Macao. In November 2007, Shanda Interactive purchased a 30 percent stake in NCsoft China, giving Shanda the rights to distribute the popular game Aion in China. =2008-2009: Shanda Literature= Shanda Games Limited had become a business unit of Shanda Interactive by early 2008, and Shanda Interactive continued to diversify.

Qidian was the largest Chinese online literature platform in 2008, with 20 million registered accounts. In 2009, Shanda Literature spurred controversy for promoting the popular writers Guo Jingming and vivibear, both accused of plagiarism. In 2010, Shanda Literature sued the search engine Baidu.com for providing links to pirated versions of Shanda Literature's copyrighted material. Agreeing that Baidu did not remove the links immediately upon notice, a Shanghai court ruled in Shanda's favor in May 2011. =2009-2013: Spinoffs and privatization= In 2008, Shanda Interactive paid $80 million to acquire Mochi Media, an online game distributor in the United States. Shanda was the \\"largest online entertainment provider in China\\" by early 2009. That April the company reported that its MMORP Aion had acquired 1 million paying users within four days of its release. In 2009, the company spun off Shanda Games in the largest IPO with the ticker GAME in the United States that year, raising $1.04 billion. At the time, Shanda Games provided 77 percent of Shanda Interactive's revenue, although the company also continued to be active in online literature, video, and other forms of entertainment. Shanda Literature controlled 90 percent of the online reading market in China by early 2010. That year Shanda Interactive recorded operating revenues of $232.3 million, 2% higher than the prior year.

Often a Peerzada was a descendant of those buried within the tomb they were assigned to, hence most of the Peerzadas are successor to Saint buried in the tomb. It also serves as surname for their ascendants in many Indo-Aryan cultures and their accompanying languages, with Peerzada translating into “the son of a saint” in Persian. Today, predominantly-Muslim families bearing the name can be found in various regions around the world, including Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir and the northern regions of India. Much of their lineage can be traced to the central Asian plateaus, consisting of the Soviet Union’s former republics, such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Much of the modern-day Peerzada diaspora derives from the mass migration of the community from Central Asia towards several different areas immediately at a date that is estimated to be sometime during the 15th century. Diaspora =Pirzadas of India and Pakistan= The earliest recorded instance of the surname lays in a Mughal court official named Nur-ud- din Peerzada, who served at the Serai Nurmahal in the city of Nurmahal in Punjab, in 1693. By the time the Indian subcontinent was fully under control of the British Empire, Ehsan Peerzada ran a carpet-weaving guild in Amritsar that wove rugs for use by members of the British Royal Family, and Anglo aristocrats that resided in the British Raj, such as Sir John Lawrence, the first British governor of the Punjab province, United India. =Peerzadas of Kashmir= Peerzadas in Kashmir moved from Iran with Muslim missionaries to spread Islam. The roots of Peerzadas in Kashmir is Syed. =Peerzadas of Turkey= The origins of Peerzadas as they lay in Central Asia also translated into their presence in the realms of the former Ottoman Empire. As late as 1710, Ottoman census records indicate Peerzadas residing in Turkish municipalities such Istanbul, Denizli, Bursa, and Tokat, with their professions revolving around textiles, finance, and military service. Cüneyt Peerzada held the rank of Binbaşı, or Major, in the Kapıkulu Süvarileri, or Six Divisions of Cavalry of the Ottoman Empire, as per records from 1741. The Peerzadas of Turkey also practiced carpet-weaving in much the same fashion as their counterparts in the Indian subcontinent, with Ottoman tax receipts displaying a thriving artisan practice in Tokat as late as 1874. =Peerzadas of Iran= Peerzadas were first recorded in modern-day Persia during the rule of the Qajar Dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925. Census records indicate their first presence being in the village of Urmia, close to the border with Azerbaijan, in the year 1783, although they had been a mainstay in the region for close to a century prior. Originally a farming community, Peerzadas eventually began to emerge as an astute family of financial bankers in the cities of Tehran and Qom, with tax records indicating their roles as facilitators of mercantile trade and credit among officials of the Qajar dynasty and foreigners wishing to ship their wares to Persia. Some Peerzadas eventually harnessed their financial backgrounds for the purpose of the Qajar themselves, with an upwards of six generations of the family serving as civil servants and bureaucrats for the government till the last-recorded instance of 1911. In addition, Peerzadas combined their expertise in textiles and finance in order to benefit from Isfahan’s status as the artisan hub of Islamic crafts and goods, as the family not only wove, but handled the business behind their own autonomous carpeting businesses. =Peerzadas of Afghanistan= The Peerzadas of Afghanistan were relatively few in number: the community never expanded beyond a few dozen patrons of a single family, although a minority of them are found in the city of Ghazni Afghanistan. Demographics =Religion= Pirzadas are affiliated with sayeds or Pirs family due to their origins in Central Asia, although there does exist a diversity in regards to the sects and subdivisions of the faith. Peerzadas found in 70% Sunni Muslims around the world,Pakistan and Northern India sympathize with the Sunni branch of Islam, while there exists a small minority of them within them who actively profess faith in the Aga Khan and subsequently the practices of the 30% Shia Muslim. =Ethnicity= At their core, every individual belonging to the Peerzada family comes from an Hashmi bloodline originating in Mekkah. They originally belong to the Banu Hashim tribe of Muhammad, which is predominately found in Saudi Arabia. They are Syed's. Especially Pakistan and India are descendants of Muslim Bin Aqeel (the first martyr of karbala in kofa). They are found in the footprints of mass migration from Saudi Arabia after the tragedy of Karbala like to, Afghanistan, Sub-Continent,Iran, Turkey etc. List of Notable Pirzadas *Sharifuddin Pirzada, Secretary General Organization of the Islamic Conference from 1985 to 1988 *Moeed Pirzada, Pakistani journalist *Mehreen Pirzada, Indian actress and model *Rabi Peerzada, Pakistani actress * Ali Habib Pirzada,Pakistani References Social groups of Pakistan Military of the Ottoman Empire Social groups of India Sufism ","title":"Pirzada"},{"id":"2941737","text":"Killing Ground is the fifteenth full-length studio album by heavy metal band Saxon.

History The town is named after the Arthur River, which flows through it, a headwater of the Blackwood River. The river was named by Governor James Stirling in October 1835 after Arthur Trimmer who was a member of the exploring expedition led by the Governor. Trimmer arrived in Western Australia in April 1831 and selected land at York. In 1836 he married Mary Ann, one of King George Sound Government Resident Sir Richard Spencer’s daughters. Following the introduction of convicts in Western Australia labour to the Swan River Colony in the early 1850s, the road from Perth to Albany was completed and a number of small settlements sprang up along it to support pastoralists who had been granted grazing leases in the area from as early as 1854. Arthur River gradually developed into a thriving centre with a police barracks and gaol (1866), the Mount Pleasant Inn (1869), St Paul's Church (1885) still surviving to this day as remnants of the original settlement, and a post office, blacksmith, doctor and trading post also being built around that time. By the end of the century it was the major centre in the area. The towns post office originally operated out of the inn. Mary Ann Spratt was appointed as the post mistress in 1866. The post office itself was not gazetted until 1892 which was the same year that the telegraph line was connected. The first telephone subscriber service commenced in 1913. When the Great Southern Railway opened in 1889, much of the existing trade moved to new railway towns further east and many of the centres along the old \\"Coach Road\\" closed. A bridge over the Arthur River was built in 1907 at Nobles Crossing. Present day Old Post Office building Arthur River mainly serves as a fuel stop for travellers, with some of the historic buildings open to tourists. Located in the town are the Arthur River Roadhouse, which does fantastic home cooking and baking. The Arthur Wool Shed Group, with shearing shed, shearers' quarters, sheep dip and concrete cricket pitch, is one of the most prominent buildings in the town. It was first established in 1910 and opened as a one-stop-shop for community shearers in the 1950s. It was extensively restored in the three years to 2002, at which point the complex was heritage listed by the Heritage Council of WA.

The Williams River passes through the town. At the , Williams had a population of 338. History Williams is named after the Williams River which flows nearby. The river was sighted by Captain Thomas Bannister in 1831 while leading the first overland expedition from the Swan River Colony to King George Sound (now Albany), and was first shown on an 1833 map. More than likely, the name honours King William IV, who reigned in the United Kingdom from June 1830 until June 1837. The first claims on land in the area occurred in 1832. In 1835 a party led by Governor James Stirling and John Septimus Roe surveyed a route joining King George Sound with York via Williams to encourage inland settlement. No settlement occurred until after Lieutenant Henry Bunbury explored the region in 1836, despite his assessment that \\"on the Williams the land is generally very bad and the water brackish.\\" After the building of Albany Highway by convicts in the 1850s, Williams became an important stopover point for passengers and changing of horses and became the main centre in the district. The bridge over the Williams River was completed in 1855. The Williams Hotel was erected in 1871, and a Road Board (predecessor to the current Shire Council) first convened in 1877. In early 1898 the population of the town was 55, 30 males and 25 females. Later the same year the local Agricultural Hall was opened by Frederick Piesse, it was built at a cost of £250 granted by Parliament. The original town had been built on the Albany side of the river, but was subject to increasing floods due to the clearing of the land for intensive farming; therefore the town was relocated to the Perth side of the bridge. The town site was surveyed in 1905 and most of the buildings in the present town site were constructed after that time. The Williams District Club was constructed in 1959 with the foundation stone was set in December 1958. The Williams Shire offices were constructed the same year. Present day Williams District Memorial Hall in 2018 Today the town is a centre for the wool, cattle and coarse grains industry, and serves as a stopping point on the Albany Highway. A heritage trail takes visitors past some of Williams's historic buildings and nearby wildflower stands and dryandra forests are also attractions. One unusual feature is the Jesse Martin museum, a historic village and memorabilia collection constructed by a local farmer on his own property from old shops and post offices on the verge of being demolished in country towns, as well as barns full of old cars and farm machinery.

As they go after the Mafia boss, Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), Agent 11 attacks him and rips off one of his testicles. Sonny is taken to the hospital to have it surgically replaced. As payback, he sends his two bodyguards, Gino and Arliss (Joe Viterelli and Steve Schirripa respectively), to kill Agent 11. For protection, Agent 11 is sent to a training facility in Alaska. After Agent 11 escapes, he meets Gordon Smith (David Arquette), who works as a mailman. Gordon dislikes dogs and has volunteered to take care of James (Angus T.

Gino and Arliss have continued their search for Agent 11, whom James names \\"Spot.\\" Agent 11 does not want to catch balls or frisbees because Murdoch told him not to play when he was a puppy, but he eventually starts to do so with Gordon and James like a normal dog.

Gardner was the BBC's representative in the production of the political romantic comedy The Girl in the Café (2005), written by Richard Curtis in conjunction with the Make Poverty History campaign. Other network dramas commissioned by Gardner at BBC Wales included the multiple personality disorder drama May 33rd (2004); domestic abuse-themed one-off Dad (2005); courtroom reconstruction The Chatterley Affair (2006) and the time travel police series Life on Mars (2006–2007), produced independently by Kudos Film & Television. Gardner and Davies also oversaw two Doctor Who spin-offs: Torchwood, an adult (post-watershed) science fiction drama aired on BBC Three and BBC Two, and The Sarah Jane Adventures, a children's fantasy thriller aired on BBC One and CBBC. In September 2006, it was announced that Gardner would succeed Jane Tranter as the overall Controller of Drama Commissioning at BBC Television, following Tranter's promotion to the new \\"Head of Fiction\\" role. However, Gardner remained in her position at BBC Wales, performing the two jobs simultaneously, until 2009; her roles at BBC Wales and with Doctor Who were then assumed by producer Piers Wenger. Gardner received credit for an increase in drama being made in Wales; in 2007, Cardiff-born writer Andrew Davies called her \\"the best thing to happen to Welsh drama. Ever.\\" In March 2009, it was announced that Gardner was to join the staff of Los Angeles-based BBC Worldwide America, as executive producer in charge of scripted projects. It was announced in late 2009 that Julie was five months pregnant and her first child, Huckleberry, fathered by Doctor Who sound recordist Julian Howarth, was born in early summer 2010. In 2015, Gardner cofounded the production company Bad Wolf with Jane Tranter. Bad Wolf has since produced numerous TV series, including The Night Of, His Dark Materials, and Industry.

According to Article 1.107 of the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR)ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.107, definition: marker beacon a marker beacon is defined as A transmitter in the aeronautical radionavigation service which radiates vertically a distinctive pattern for providing position information to aircraft. History From the 1930s until the 1950s, markers were used extensively along airways to provide an indication of an aircraft's specific position along the route, but from the 1960s they have become increasingly limited to ILS approach installations. They are now very gradually being phased out of service, especially in more developed parts of the world, as GPS and other technologies have made marker beacons increasingly redundant. Types There are three types of marker beacons that may be installed as part of their most common application—an instrument landing system. =Outer marker= Outer-marker indicator The outer marker, which normally identifies the final approach fix (FAF), is situated on the same course/track as the localizer and the runway center-line, four to seven nautical milesILS – Marker beacons; ILS.com; retrieved . before the runway threshold. It is typically located about inside the point where the glideslope intercepts the intermediate altitude and transmits a 400 Hz tone signal on a low-powered (3 watts), 75 MHz carrier signal. Its antenna is highly directional, and is pointed straight up. The valid signal area is a × ellipse (as measured above the antenna.) When the aircraft passes over the outer marker antenna, its marker beacon receiver detects the signal. The system gives the pilot a visual (blinking blue outer marker light) and aural (continuous series of audio tone morse code-like 'dashes') indication. A locator outer marker In the United States, the outer marker has often been combined with a non-directional beacon (NDB) to make a locator outer marker (LOM). An LOM is a navigation aid used as part of an instrument landing system (ILS) instrument approach for aircraft. Aircraft can navigate directly to the location using the NDB as well as be alerted when they fly over it by the beacon. The LOM is becoming less important now that GPS navigation is well established in the aviation community.Note:Some ILS approaches have no navigation aid at all situated at the final approach fix, but use other means, such as VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) radial intersections, distance measuring equipment (DME), GPS, or radar fixes, to identify the position. Some countries, such as Canada, have abandoned marker beacons completely, replacing the outer marker with a NDB; and, more recently, with GPS fixes. In the U.S., LOMs are identified by two-letter Morse code modulated at 1020 Hz. LOMs use the first two letters of the parent ILS's identification. For example, at New York's JFK runway 31R the ILS identifier is I-RTH and the LOM ident is RT. If this facility were a locator middle marker (LMM) its identifier would be the last two letters, TH. =Middle marker= Middle-marker indicator A middle marker works on the same principle as an outer marker. It is normally positioned 0.5 to before the runway threshold. When the aircraft is above the middle marker, the receiver's amber middle marker light starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I missed approach point (typically above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the missed approach if one of several visual cues has not been spotted. =Inner marker= Inner-marker indicator Similar to the outer and middle markers, a inner marker located at the beginning (threshold) of the runway on some ILS approach systems (usually Category II and III) having decision heights of less than AGL. Triggers a flashing white light on the same marker beacon receiver used for the outer and middle markers; also a series of audio tone 'dots' at a frequency of 3,000 Hz in the headset. On some older marker beacon receivers, instead of the \\"O\\", \\"M\\" and \\"I\\" indicators (outer, middle, inner), the indicators are labeled \\"A\\" (or FM/Z), \\"O\\" and \\"M\\" (airway or Fan and Z marker, outer, middle). The airway marker was used to indicate reporting points along the centerline of now obsolete \\"Red\\" airways; this was sometimes a \\"fan\\" marker, whose radiated pattern was elongated at right angles across the airway course so an aircraft slightly off course would still receive it. A \\"Z\\" marker was sometimes located at low- or medium-frequency range sites to accurately denote station passage. As airway beacons used the same 3,000 Hz audio frequency as the inner marker, the \\"A\\" indicator on older receivers can be used to detect the inner marker. Back course marker A back course marker (BC) normally indicates the ILS back-course final-approach fix where approach descent is commenced. It is identified by pairs of Morse-code \\"dots\\" at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a marker beacon indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an inner marker or en-route marker. Fan marker The term fan marker refers to the older type of beacons used mostly for en- route navigation.Marker beacon; Answers.com: attributed to McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Aviation.Note: The term fan marker can refer to almost any type of marker beacons used in aviation (including inner/middle/outer markers), since most of them transmit signal in the fan-shaped pattern (i.e. in a shape of a hand-held fan held up perpendicular to the flight course). Fan-type marker beacons were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal.Instrument Flight Training Manual; Amazon.com; accessed . Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.FAA AIM 1-1-9 ; article; FAA.com; retrieved .Note: They are only used on a few instrument approaches anymore, to mark positions along the inbound course, when there is only one marker present: for an example, see the - here GRIGG is a fan marker. Quote regarding marker beacons –from an old edition of AIM, section 1-1-9. In August 2017 seven fan markers remain in service in the USA.

She was one of the very few women to rule as monarchs in India and promoted a male image in order to do so. This was a significant change and one that was followed by her successor and also by the later Vijayanagara Empire.  Family and succession  Inscription on the death of Rani Rudrama Devi in Chandupatla, 1289 Rudrama Devi married Virabhadra, a member of a minor branch of the Chalukya dynasty, probably in 1240. This was almost certainly a political marriage designed by her father to forge alliances. Virabhadra is virtually undocumented and played no part in her administration. The couple had two daughters (both are adopted). Rudrama Devi probably began her rule of the Kakatiya kingdom jointly with her father, Ganapatideva, as his co-regent, from 1261-62. She assumed full sovereignty in 1263. Unlike her Kakatiya predecessors, she chose to recruit as warriors many people who were not aristocratic, granting them rights over land tax revenue in return for their support. Rudrama Devi faced challenges from the Eastern Ganga dynasty and the Yadavas soon after beginning her rule. She was able to repel the former, who retreated beyond the Godavari River in the late 1270s, and she also defeated the Yadavas, who were forced to cede territory in western Andhra. She was, however, unsuccessful in dealing with the internal dissent posed by the Kayastha chieftain Ambadeva after he became head of his line in 1273. Ambadeva objected to being subordinate to the Kakatiyas and he gained control of much of southwestern Andhra and what is now Guntur District. Rudrama Devi may have died in 1289 while fighting Ambadeva, although some sources say she did not die until 1295. She was succeeded by Prataparudra, a son of one of her daughters, who inherited a kingdom that was smaller than it had been when Rudrama Devi had ascended her throne.  In popular culture  Film maker Gunasekhar made a Telugu film Rudhramadevi on the life of Rudrama Devi with Anushka Shetty, Allu Arjun, Rana Daggubati and Krishnam Raju in the lead roles.

Cherry III and starring Jim Varney. It is the second film to feature the character of Ernest P. Worrell and was shot at Montgomery Bell State Park. It was also the first Ernest film to be distributed by Touchstone Pictures. This film also marks Iron Eyes Cody's final appearance on screen. Plot Long ago, a young Plains warrior is tested for initiation by being the target of three different weapons. Centuries later, Ernest P. Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud. A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. He ultimately goes too far by intentionally causing \\"Moose\\" Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake while swimming. After Moose is rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, breaking Stennis' leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor, and because Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis' position to Ernest. The Second Chancers initially give Ernest trouble, but they start to show some respect during a campfire session when Nurse St. Cloud, the Chief's granddaughter, translates her grandfather's description of the warrior initiation ritual for his tribe. The initiate must hold still while a knife, a stone hatchet, and an arrow are thrown or shot at him. The courage of the young warrior apparently alters the course of each weapon to prevent it from striking him. The Second Chancers later build a tepee only to see it get burned. They fight Pennington and his friends, because they were responsible for the fire. Tipton is poised to expel the Second Chancers, but Ernest convinces him otherwise. Meanwhile, a mining corporation run by Sherman Krader wants to mine the petrocite at Kikakee, but Chief St. Cloud refuses to sell. Upon realizing that the Chief does not even understand English, Krader manipulates Ernest into obtaining the Chief's signature under false pretenses. Ernest, thinking that he is helping the Chief sign an anti-pollution petition, instead unknowingly convinces the Chief to sign the land away. Tipton sadly announces that the camp must close. Nurse St. Cloud confronts Ernest, who stammers that he will fix the situation. Ernest and the Second Chancers storm onto the construction site and demand to see the boss. Krader is not present, but the foreman, Bronk is. Ernest tries to fight him, but Bronk brutally beats him up. The Second Chancers give up on Ernest and storm away. Later, Nurse St. Cloud overhears the kids demeaning Ernest's effort, so she reveals to them that Ernest is the only person who has defended them. They resolve to find him and apologize. They then form a plan to stop Krader and his construction crew. Krader is prepared to demolish Kikakee, and while the regular staff and campers are sent home, Ernest and the Second Chancers openly attack the construction site to stall for time. They are joined by Chief St. Cloud, chefs Jake and Eddie, and former camper rivals, Pennington and Brooks. The group improvises some non-lethal weapons. Chief St. Cloud arrives to bless the fighters, although Nurse St. Cloud begs them not to go through with it. The assault quickly cripples the construction site's equipment. However, Bronk escapes in a bulldozer and destroys several camp buildings. The group stops him with Ernest's motorized maintenance cart filled with explosives, Ernest then knocks out Bronk. Krader arrives on the scene with his lawyer, and then targets Ernest with his hunting rifle. Echoing Kikakee's ancient testimonial pow wow, Ernest faces down Krader and apparently passes the test as Krader takes three shots at him, missing every time. Ernest then plugs Krader's rifle with his finger and laughs in his face, signaling Krader's defeat. As Krader retreats, Nurse St. Cloud returns with a restraining order against the demolition. Kamp Kikakee is once again operational, with all the campers and a full staff on site. Nurse St. Cloud thanks Ernest for all he has done and reveals that Krader was ultimately arrested for fraud. Ernest is a full-fledged counselor, and the last chance kids get to stay at camp. When trying to rebuild the Kamp Kikakee sign, Ernest falls; and the sign falls on him. Cast * Jim Varney as Ernest P.

The town is the centre of apple production in Western Australia. The town is also known for its picturesque abundance of English Oak trees. History The first humans to live in the area were the Noongar Aboriginals. It was first settled by Europeans around 1842 when George Nash and others moved to the area. They named the place \\"Donnybrook\\" after the suburb of Dublin, Ireland that they came from. The eastern part of the town was formerly called Minninup. The western portion of the townsite is currently known as Irishtown. The town of Donnybrook was gazetted in 1894. The population of the town was 430 (294 males and 136 females) in 1898. In 1897, Richard Hunter discovered gold about 6 kilometres south of the Donnybrook townsite. Hunter eventually sold out to Fred Camilleri (a well known prospector from Kalgoorlie) and Camilleri was able to interest the internationally renowned Polish geologist Modest Maryanski. It was on the basis of Maryanski's report that a new company \\"Donnybrook Goldfields Ltd\\" was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1899. A mini gold rush occurred, resulting in the Government gazetting the Donnybrook Goldfield - in the process making provision for a new town to be called \\"Goldtown\\". From the census of 1901, it was known over 200 gold miners were camped on the goldfields. The excitement was short-lived however, and the Hunters Venture mine closed in August 1903. The area was worked during the Great Depression by locals Laurie and Foster Payne, then re-pegged and explored during the 1980s and again from 2004-5. Geography =Climate= Donnybrook experiences a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Although summers are usually dry, heavy downpours in the summer are not uncommon. Donnybrook gets 93.9 clear days annually. Industry Donnybrook is the home of Western Australia's apple industry. In 1900, the first Granny Smith apple tree was planted, and the apple orchard industry grew after World War I. Apples are harvested between March and May, with apple blossoms prominent in October. Donnybrook's industries also include timber, beef, dairy and viticulture. Many visiting backpackers earn money by picking fruit from orchards in the area between November and June. Many apple trees are being replaced with Avocado trees. Tourism Apple decorations along Donnybrook's main street Donnybrook has many town icons bearing the apple. On the main street, apple-shaped lights line the entrance of the Old Railway Station. These lights have recently been restored. Atop the east Donnybrook hill is a tower with an apple at the top. The apple is part of The Big Apple Farmstay.(formerly the Big Apple Tourist and Wildlife Park). From the top of the apple, farmstay guests can view Donnybrook and its surrounding areas. The Lady William big apple is made of fibreglass and is tall with a diameter of , making it one of Australia's \\"Big Things\\". The Apple FunPark, the largest free-entry playground in Australia, opened in Easter 2008 in time for the Donnybrook Apple Festival. The fruit- themed park has play equipment and an adult exercise area. =Apple festival= Manjimup and Bridgetown The Donnybrook Apple Festival is held every year during Easter. During the apple festival, the citizens of Donnybrook gather at Egan Park to celebrate the apple. The festival includes agricultural displays, sideshow alley, a Saturday evening concert & fireworks display and a street parade. During the street parade the Catholic Church of Donnybrook blesses the holy apple, assuring a good harvest in the years to come. The Apple Festival also had a mascot, Donny Applebrook, created in 1997. Donny was a giant green apple who promoted the festival. English Oak Donnybrook is home to Australia's largest known English Oak. The tree, believed to originate from 1893 is a landmark within the town. There is also a time capsule under this tree.

She managed to retain the confidence, however, of her mother-in-law, a lady-in-waiting in the household of the comtesse de Provence, who now became titular queen of France. At the court of the restored Bourbons, Mme de Cayla was also the protegée of the vicomte Sosthène de La Rochefoucauld and from about 1817, at first very discreetly, became the major avenue through which the Ultras were able to influence the aged and emotionally needy Louis XVIII, who lavished favours upon Mme de Cayla, though she was unlikely ever to have been his mistress.Lamartine, in his memoirs, recalled that \\"the king's sentiment for this attractive woman had from the first the character of a love which hides from itself, under the name of friendship, what the age of the King and the reserve of the woman did not permit to be avowed; he felt an affection for her which he styled paternal, and he called her his daughter, not daring through respect for himself and respect for her, to call her by any other name.\\" Saint-Amand 1892:260-61.

After the death of her royal patron in 1824 she turned her attention to agriculture, raising a new breed of sheep named in her honour, from a long-haired Nubian ram that had been presented to her by Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt. She supported the pile carpet manufactory of Savonnerie in its last independent days before it was absorbed by the Gobelins in 1826. During a visit which she paid to London in 1829, Greville observed in his diary:Charles C. F. Greville, A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV, vol.

Kreutz was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and earned Pac-10 honors during his junior year, after which he elected to turn pro. Professional career Olin Kreutz on July 27, 2007 at the Chicago Bears 2007 Training Camp. =NFL Draft= According to Sports Illustrated, Kreutz was the No. 1 center available in the 1998 NFL Draft.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/events/1998/nfldraft/topplayers/byposition/OC.html He was described as \\"a good technician\\" who \\"has all the physical tools to be a solid NFL player\\" while being able to \\"handle really big NT and DT.\\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/events/1998/nfldraft/topplayers/40.html The Chicago Bears drafted Kreutz in the third round, 64th overall. He was the highest selected Washington interior lineman since Ed Cunningham in 1992. It was also the second consecutive year in which the Bears selected an offensive lineman from Washington, after Bob Sapp in 1997. =Chicago Bears= Over his thirteen-year career with the Bears, Kreutz was selected to six Pro Bowls, was selected once as a 1st team All-Pro, and was one of the team's most consistent offensive linemen. He started 182 regular-season games for the Bears, second only to Walter Payton. In an incident eerily reminiscent of his college days, Kreutz drew controversy during the 2005 NFL season after breaking the jaw of fellow offensive lineman Fred Miller during an off-practice outing. The NFL fined both players $50,000. On October 2006, Kreutz was signed to a three-year contract extension through the 2010 season. In 2007, Kreutz was appointed as one of the team's captains. In 2011, Kreutz chose to end his career with the Chicago Bears after turning down an offer of $4 million for one year. Kreutz was the longest tenured Bears member at the time he left the organization. =New Orleans Saints= On August 5, 2011, Kreutz signed with the New Orleans Saints for a one-year $2 million contract with an additional $2 million in incentives. Kreutz played in four of the Saints' first six games, missing the other two with a knee injury. He then decided to quit the team, saying that he had lost his \\"passion\\" for the game;Mike Triplett, \\"New Orleans Saints center Olin Kreutz decides to leave team\\", Times-Picayune, October 21, 2011. the Saints were reportedly planning to move him to the \\"left team\\" list.John Clayton, \\"Olin Kreutz not feeling it, leaving Saints\\", ESPN.com, October 21, 2011. In an interview, Kreutz cited Offensive Line coach Aaron Kromer’s incessant castigation as the catalyst for his exit. A confrontation with Kromer resulted in Kreutz inadvertently throwing QB Drew Brees against a wall. After the incident, Kreutz stated, “it was time for me to go.” He was waived after leaving the squad on October 22. Post-retirement On August 19, 2015, Kreutz signed on to be in the WSCR 670 the Score Bears post game show along with James Williams and Hub Arkush, replacing the recently deceased Doug Buffone. In 2019, Kreutz joined NBC Sports Chicago's Football Aftershow, serving as a Bears gameday analyst alongside Laurence Holmes and former teammates Lance Briggs, Alex Brown, and Matt Forte. Personal life Kreutz is married to his high school sweetheart, Wendi; they have six children, and reside in Lake Forest, Illinois, but also have a winter home in Kalama Valley, Hawaii.

In humans it is encoded by the MTR gene (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase). Methionine synthase forms part of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) biosynthesis and regeneration cycle. In animals this enzyme requires Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) as a cofactor, whereas the form found in plants is cobalamin-independent. Microorganisms express both cobalamin-dependent and cobalamin-independent forms.  Mechanism  The reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase (click to enlarge) Methionine synthase catalyzes the final step in the regeneration of methionine(Met) from homocysteine(Hcy). The overall reaction transforms 5-methyltetrahydrofolate(N5-MeTHF) into tetrahydrofolate (THF) while transferring a methyl group to Homocysteine to form Methionine. Methionine synthase is the only mammalian enzyme that metabolizes N5-MeTHF to regenerate the active cofactor THF. In cobalamin-dependent forms of the enzyme, the reaction proceeds by two steps in a ping-pong reaction. The enzyme is initially primed into a reactive state by the transfer of a methyl group from N5-MeTHF to Co(I) in enzyme-bound cobalamin(Cob), forming methyl-cobalamin(Me- Cob) that now contains Me-Co(III) and activating the enzyme. Then, a Hcy that has coordinated to an enzyme-bound zinc to form a reactive thiolate reacts with the Me-Cob. The activated methyl group is transferred from Me-Cob to the Hcy thiolate, which regenerates Co(I) in cob, and Met is released from the enzyme. The cob-independent mechanism follows the same general pathway but with a direct reaction between the zinc thiolate and N5-MeTHF. Scavenger Pathway of Methionine Synthase Reductase to Recover Inactivated Methionine Synthase The mechanism of the enzyme depends on the constant regeneration of Co(I) in cob, but this is not always guaranteed. Instead, every 1–2000 catalytic turnovers, the Co(I) may be oxidized into Co(II), which would permanently shut down catalytic activity. A separate protein, Methionine Synthase Reductase, catalyzes the regeneration of Co(I) and the restoration of enzymatic activity. Because the oxidation of cob-Co(I) inevitably shuts down cob-dependent methionine synthase activity, defects or deficiencies in methionine synthase reductase have been implicated in some of the disease associations for methionine synthase deficiency discussed below. The two enzymes form a scavenger network seen on the lower left.  Structure  Homocysteine Binding Domain in Methionine Synthase. His 618, Cys 620, and Cys704 bind Zn(purple) which binds to Homocysteine(Red) Crystal structures for both cob-independent and cob-dependent MetH have been solved, with little similarity in the overall structure despite the identical net reaction being performed by each and similarities within binding sites such as Hcy binding site. Cob-dependent MetH is divided into 4 separate domains: Activation, Cobalamin-binding(Cob domain), Homocysteine binding(Hcy domain), and N 5-methylTHF binding(MeTHF domain). The activation domain is the site of interaction with Methionine Synthase Reductase and binds SAM that is used as part of the re-activation cycle of the enzyme. The Cob domain contains Cob sandwiched between several large alpha helices and bound to the enzyme so that the cobalt atom of the group is exposed for contact with other domains. The Hcy domain contains the critical zinc-binding site, made up of cysteine or histidine residues coordinated to a zinc ion that can bind Hcy, with an example from a non-Cob dependent MetH shown on the right. The N5-MeTHF binding domain contains a conserved barrel in which N5-MeTHF can hydrogen bond with asparagine, arginine, and aspartic acid residues. The entire structure undergoes a dramatic swinging motion during catalysis as the Cob domain moves back and forth from the Hcy domain to the Fol domain, transferring the active methyl group from the Fol to Hcy domain.  Function  Methionine synthase is enzyme 4 Methionine synthase's main purpose is to regenerate Met in the S-Adenosyl Methionine cycle, which in a single turnover consumes Met and ATP and generates Hcy. This cycle is critical because S-adenosyl methionine is used extensively in biology as a source of an active methyl group, and so methionine synthase serves an essential function by allowing the SAM cycle to perpetuate without a constant influx of Met. In this way, methionine synthase also serves to maintain low levels of Hcy and, because methionine synthase is one of the few enzymes that used N5-MeTHF as a substrate, to indirectly maintain THF levels. In plants and microorganisms, methionine synthase serves a dual purpose of both perpetuating the SAM cycle and catalyzing the final synthetic step in the de novo synthesis of Met. While the reaction is exactly the same for both processes, the overall function is distinct from methionine synthase in humans because Met is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in the body.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the MTR gene have been identified as the underlying cause of methylcobalamin deficiency complementation group G, or methylcobalamin deficiency cblG-type. Deficiency or deregulation of the enzyme due to deficient methionine synthase reductase can directly result in elevated levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia), which is associated with blindness, neurological symptoms, and birth defects. Most cases of methionine synthase deficiency are symptomatic within 2 years of birth with many patients rapidly developing severe encephalopathy. One consequence of reduced methionine synthase activity that is measurable by routine clinical blood tests is megaloblastic anemia.  Genetics  Several polymorphisms in the MTR gene have been identified. * 2756D→G (Asp919Gly)  See also  * Methyltransferase * Arakawa's syndrome II * 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF, 5-Me-H4F, 5-MTHF) * Betaine—homocysteine S-methyltransferase  References   Further reading       External links  * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Disorders of Intracellular Cobalamin Metabolism * ENZYME: EC 2.1.1.13 * EC 2.1.1 Human proteins Zinc enzymes ","title":"Methionine synthase"},{"id":"2941867","text":"Mullalyup is a town in the South West region of Western Australia, situated between Kirup and Balingup on the South Western Highway, south of Perth.

The program was a version of an activity at Japanese universities, the gaman taikai or \\"endurance contest\\", where students try to outdo each other in withstanding unpleasant experiences. The TV program featured teams from universities, such as Keio University, who were subjected to various unpleasant ordeals, such as being buried up to the neck in sand or licked by reptiles. The person who endured the longest was declared the winner. Short segments of the program were used in the British television shows, which humorously examined television programs from around the world. Following Clive James on Television, clips from the now-defunct show were also used in the 1990s in Tarrant on TV. A very short-lived British version of the show was also created, hosted by Paul Ross, but it did not feature the extreme conditions of the original program. Only two series of the British version were produced for Challenge TV which first aired from 1997 to 1998, and it saw little success. The use of the clips on the Clive James show created some controversy, with some Japanese feeling that the show was unrepresentative, and some former British prisoners of war also complained about the contents.

It is currently a subsidiary of investment bank B. Riley Financial. The company's range of products and services has evolved significantly since its inception as a provider of dial- up Internet access. This has been aided by a series of acquisitions that have included Classmates Online (2004), MyPoints (2006), and FTD Group, Inc. (2008), the latter of which was spun off as its own company in 2013. United Online is headquartered in Woodland Hills, California, United States. The company claims to have more than 100 million registered accounts. The company’s Content & Media segment provides networking services and products (Classmates and StayFriends). Its primary communications segment services are internet access, and services and devices (NetZero and Juno). United Online operates through a global network of locations in the U.S., Germany, and India. On July 1, 2016, B. Riley Financial completed its acquisition of United Online for $11.00 per share in a transaction valued at approximately $170 million. History United Online, Inc. was formed in June 2001 by the merger of Internet service providers NetZero and Juno Online Services. The two merged companies were to be independent subsidiaries of United Online, and the resultant company was the United States' second largest internet service provider at the time. In November 2013, United Online spun off its floral delivery subsidiary, FTD, which became a separate NASDAQ-traded company called FTD Companies, Inc., under the symbol FTD. Directly following the spin-off of FTD, long time CEO Mark Goldston, who had been with the company for 14 years, taken it public and presided over the acquisitions and growth, left the company. Francis Lobo, who had spent 10 years with AOL, eventually rising to the position of president of AOL Services, was selected to take Goldston's place as CEO. The company continued to struggle, and Lobo eventually resigned. Following Lobo's exit, the investment bank B. Riley Financial acquired the remnants of UOL on July 1, 2016, naming Robert J. Taragan the new CEO of the subsidiary. In April 2016, United Online sold MyPoints to El Segundo, California-based loyalty program marketer Prodege. Products Faced with the introduction and rapid expansion of broadband Internet-access services, United Online has diversified its products and service offerings, both via acquisitions and by evolving its current brands. =ISP= In September 2007, NetZero launched its first broadband access service, NetZero DSL. In May 2008, it launched Juno DSL. Together, NetZero DSL and Juno DSL provided almost 30 percent of United Online’s ISP customers, and provided those customers with the ability to upgrade to broadband while maintaining their NetZero or Juno email addresses. =Mobile broadband= In March 2012, NetZero expanded into the wireless Internet access market with the debut of NetZero Mobile Broadband, a value-priced mobile broadband service using the Clearwire network. NetZero Mobile Broadband was available in over 80 cities, and allowed subscribers to choose from four monthly data plans. It also offered a one-year free trial with the purchase of a NetZero Connection device. NetZero Mobile Broadband has since rolled out the service across the nationwide using the Sprint 3G network, expanding its coverage to more than 276 million people. NetZero also offers a Home Wireless Broadband service which is intended to provide limited wireless access in the home or office. In 2013, it debuted NetZero DataShield, a personal VPN which encrypts and protects users’ data when they connect to the Internet via any WiFi connection, including public WiFi hubs. =Mobile phone= At the end of 2014, UOL rolled out a mobile phone service to their NetZero brand. The service provides 3G coverage, and features refurbished equipment (such as an iPhone 4 or Samsung Galaxy SIII for the price of $199 each) and limited monthly data. =Classmates.com= United Online's Classmates subsidiary began digitizing high school yearbooks in 2010, giving members the ability to view more than 30,000 high school yearbooks at Classmates.com.

He is the only cricketer to score a century and take a five-wicket haul on debut in a Test match. International career Taylor scored 105 and took 5–86 for New Zealand on Test debut against India at Calcutta in 1964–65, becoming the first man to have completed this all-round feat on debut. Taylor, who had never scored a first-class century before, and had played only three first-class matches, came in at No. 8 and slammed 105 in 158 minutes with 14 fours and three sixes and helped Bert Sutcliffe (151 not out) add 163 for the seventh wicket. He also scored New Zealand's fastest Test century in 1969, a record that stood until Daniel Vettori broke it in 2005. In the First Test against the West Indies at Auckland, Taylor came in with the score at 152 for 6 and hit 14 fours and five sixes. His 50 came up in 30 minutes, and his century in 86 minutes. He finished on 124. This second Test century was, remarkably, also his second first-class century.Wisden 1970, p. 907. His outstanding series was in the West Indies in 1971–72. In a batsman's series, in which all five Tests were drawn, and no other bowler on either side took more than 14 wickets, Taylor took 27 wickets at 17.70 in four Tests. His best Test figures came in the Third Test in Bridgetown, when he took 7 for 74 to dismiss the West Indies for 133 before tea on the first day, bowling, Wisden said, \\"quite superbly\\".Wisden 1973, p.892. Of his overall performance in the series, Wisden said, \\"Tight control allied to a high action enabled him to extract any bounce going and there was no greater trier in the entire New Zealand party.\\"Henry Blofeld, \\"New Zealand in the West Indies, 1971-72\\", Wisden 1973, p.880. He played his last Test on the tour to England in 1973. Domestic career His highest first-class score came in 1972–73, when he hit 173 against Otago at Dunedin, after coming in to bat with the score on 42 for 4. He played his last first-class match in 1979–80. After cricket Since finishing as an active player Taylor has served as a selector for the Wellington, Otago and national teams. In early 1993 he resigned his job as bursar at John McGlashan College in Dunedin following allegations of financial irregularities. In the grip of a gambling addiction, he had stolen $360,000 from the school.

Translated as \\"chief of the scribes\\" or \\"head clerk\\", the holder of the post was originally the head of the chancery of the Imperial Council, evolving into an analogue to a Foreign Minister. In 1836, the title of reis ül-küttab was formally changed to Foreign Minister (Hariciye Nazırı) with the establishment of the Ottoman Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the Tanzimat reforms.  Establishment and evolution  The office is first attested in the early 1520s, and was in all likelihood a creation of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent (r. 1520–66), although it may have existed for far longer than that as a junior post attached to the government. As its name attests—reis ül-küttab means as much as \\"head scribe\\" or \\"head clerk\\"—the post was in charge of the clerks of the Imperial Council (divan-ı hümayun), which formed the government of the Ottoman Empire. Prior to Suleyman's reign, the functions of the office were shared by the emin-i akham (\\"depository of the decisions\\") and the nişancı (\\"chancellor\\"). Analogues existed however in other eastern Islamic states, as well as in Ottoman provinces, where a divan efendi presided over the council of the local governors (valis). According to J. Deny, the establishment of the reis ül-küttab was the transfer of this practice to the capital. Its establishment coincided with the gradual increase of the number of clerks attached to the various senior offices and departments of state, which began under Suleyman and continued well into the 17th century; thus for instance the seven and eleven clerks attached respectively to the defterdar (\\"treasurer\\") and the nişancı, ca. 1530, had increased to nine and 25 respectively by 1561. The first occupant of the office was probably a certain Haydar Efendi, who died in 1523/4, but the first well-known incumbent was the historian , who held the post from 1524/5 until his promotion to nişancı in 1534. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the reis ül-küttab was drawn from the senior secretarial staff of the viziers or, more often, and from the early 17th century almost exclusively, the Grand Vizier. A regular line of promotion (tarik) was established, whereby one advanced from ordinary secretary (Persian: khalife, Turkish: kalfa) in one of the bureaux of the Grand Vizier's secretariat to senior clerk (ser-khalife or baş-kalfa) and eventually to bureau chief (mektubcı). The latter post entailed close proximity to the Grand Vizier and was a springboard for the highest offices. On rare occasions, the person chosen as reis ül-küttab was not one of the Grand Vizier's mektubcıs, but the secretary of the Kahya Bey, the Grand Vizier's lieutenant.  Functions  Reception of the French ambassador by the Grand Vizier and the Imperial Council in 1724 The reis ül-küttab served in close contact with the Grand Vizier, accompanying the latter to his audiences with the Sultan, as well as to the Grand Vizier's own audiences with foreign ambassadors. However, although the reis ül-küttab attended the meetings of the Council, arriving before and leaving after the viziers, he had no right to speak himself in it or directly to the Sultan, and was obliged to do so via the Grand Vizier. His main role was as the head of the Department of the Imperial Council (divan-i hümayun kalemi), which in turn was divided into three bureaux: the beylik, under the beylikçı from the mid-17th century on, which was responsible for drafting and publishing all imperial decrees (firman) or ordinances (evamir), and for keeping an archive of the originals of all laws and regulations (kanun) and treaties with other states; the tahvil, which was responsible for issuing every year the diplomas (berat) of provincial governors, judges, and timariots; the ru'us (\\"provisions\\") office, charged with provisioning various officials, as well as paying pensions from the treasury or from charitable establishments (vakf). All state correspondence, except for military or financial matters, was in his hands. Another subordinate official, the amedcı divan-i hümayun (\\"referendar of the Imperial Council\\"), was responsible for diplomatic correspondence and for keeping records of the memoranda (telhis) and reports (takrir) presented to the Sultan by the Grand Vizier, acting on behalf of the Imperial Council. The reis ül-küttab brought these in a special bag (kise) to meetings of the Imperial Council. There they were read by the Grand Vizier to the assembled ministers, and then taken by another special official, the telhiscı (\\"memorandum writer\\"), who presented them to the Sultan.  Rise in importance  The reis ül-küttab (centre) with the Grand Dragoman (left) and the Iç Agha (right) at a reception of a European and a Bukharan diplomat Until the early 17th century, the reis ül-küttab was junior in rank and subordinate to the nişancı, but a succession of capable reis, coupled with the inability of some of the nişancı appointees resulted in the decline of the latter and the rise of the reis to prominence. Becoming attached as a clerk to the Grand Vizier allowed the reis to break loose from the control of the nişancı, and coincided with the increasing transfer of state affairs from the Imperial Council exclusively to the purview of the Grand Vizier. The increasing importance of foreign relations for the Ottoman Empire from this period on also played a role, as the reis was responsible for checking on the treaties archived in the beylik and certifying the answers to the requests, notes and petitions of foreign ambassadors to the Ottoman government. This process led to the reis ül-küttab gradually evolving into a de facto Foreign Minister, a role that became established after the successful conduct of negotiations for the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 by the then reis ül-küttab, Rami Mehmed Efendi. Nevertheless, in protocol and ceremonial, the reis ül-küttab still retained his rather junior position until the late 18th century; for instance, he was not allowed to sit in the Imperial Council chamber, but had a seat outside, the reis tahtası, and his role in court ceremonies remained limited.

Born in the city of La Paz, he lived his entire life there, and the rough topography and harsh climate of this Andean city had a powerful effect on much of his work. His poetry, though individual to the point of being difficult to classify, bears some similarities with surrealist literature. Throughout his life, Sáenz struggled with alcoholism, a struggle about which he frequently wrote in his poems. Accordingly, he is often viewed as a sort of poète maudit, or \\"cursed poet\\". Sáenz was openly, \\"unashamedly\\", bisexual.  Biography  Jaime Sáenz Guzmán was born on 29 October 1921 in La Paz, Bolivia to Lieutenant Genaro Sáenz Rivero and Graciela Guzmán Lazarte. In 1926 his parents sent him to Muñoz school, and then to the American Institute. He ended his schooling in 1937. In 1938 he traveled to Germany with some classmates to return in 1939. This trip would be crucial in his life because he became strongly influenced by the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Hegel, Martin Heidegger, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. In 1941 he started to work in the Bolivian Department of Defense, then in the Bolivian Treasury. In 1942 he joined the United States Information Service and worked there until 1952. In 1943, he married a German citizen, Erika Käseberg and in 1947 they had a daughter, Jourlaine. In 1948 Erika definitely left Sáenz. From this moment, Sáenz devoted his life not only to write but to drink, too. Carlos Alfredo Rivera, one of his best friends, tried to persuade him to stop drinking and asked for medical advice, but the intervention obviously came too late. Sáenz died in a delirium tremens crisis.

Universal Visual journalism is premised upon the idea that at a time of accelerating change, often words cannot keep pace with concepts. Visual journalism incorporates ancient symbols that resonate with humans across cultures and time and conveys meaning instantaneously at a deep level. Visual journalism is an outgrowth of the practice of graphic facilitation and recording that began entering corporate board rooms, conferences, and think tank meetings in the 1970s with the leadership of David Sibbet, founder of The Grove Consultants International. But its roots date back to ancient cave paintings and carry forward in the work of designers, architects, and engineers. Only recently has interactive visualization of this sort moved out into common use in all kinds of group engagements. The scholarly father of this visual form of communication is Robert Horn, Ph.D., a fellow at Stanford University and author of the book Visual Language. Meaning is suggested Visual journalism is not a series of symbols with precise meanings but rather images that suggest complex meanings and, in the Egyptian tradition of the cartouche, contain words. The symbols do not simply represent but participate in the meaning and, in combination with evocative phrases, are designed to provoke creative thinking. Visual language is one tool described by author Daniel Pink in his book A Whole New Mind for the emerging \\"conceptual age\\" where people must tolerate ambiguity and communicate quickly, often before concepts are ready to be captured in traditional writing.

It breeds from southern Mexico to Panama; also Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Costa Rica. Taxonomy and systematics The collared aracari was originally classified in the genus Ramphastos. Alternate names include the banded aracari, ringed aracari and spot-chested aracari. = Subspecies = Three subspecies are recognized: * P. t. torquatus - (Gmelin, 1788): Found in eastern-central Mexico to north-western Colombia * P. t. erythrozonus - Ridgway, 1912: Found in south-eastern Mexico, Belize and northern Guatemala * P. t. nuchalis - Cabanis, 1862: Originally described as a separate species. Found in north-eastern Colombia and northern Venezuela Some authorities consider the stripe-billed aracari and the pale-mandibled aracari to also be subspecies of the collared aracari. Description The red collar, which gives the bird its name, is visible on the back of the neck of this Costa Rican bird. Front Like other toucans, the collared aracari is brightly marked and has a large bill. The adult is typically long and weighs The sexes are alike in appearance, with a black head and chest and dark olive green upperparts, apart from a red rump and upper tail. There is reddish collar on the rear neck which gives rise to the English and scientific (torquatus) names. The underparts are bright yellow, with a round black spot in the centre of the breast and a red-tinted black band across the belly. The thighs are chestnut. The bare facial skin is black, becoming ruddy behind the yellow eye. The upper mandible of the bill is dull yellow, marked with a black saw-tooth pattern on the cutting edge, and a black tip. The lower mandible is black, and the legs are green. Juvenile collared aracaris are much duller, with sooty- black head and brownish green upperparts. The red rump and yellow underparts are paler, and the breast spot, belly band and bill pattern are indistinct. The call of the collared aracari is a loud, sharp pseek, or peeseek. Behaviour and ecology Small flocks, usually consisting of 6-15 birds, move through the forest with a rapid direct flight. =Breeding= Upper body The collared aracari is a common resident breeder in lowland forests and slightly more open woodland. The 3 white eggs are laid in an unlined natural cavity or old woodpecker nest high in a tree. Both sexes incubate the eggs for about 16 days, and the toucan chicks remain in the nest after hatching. They are blind and naked at birth, and have short bills and specialised pads on their heels to protect them from the rough floor of the nest. They are fed by both parents, assisted by up to three other adults, probably from a previous brood, and fledge after about 6 weeks, with feeding by the adults continuing for several weeks after leaving the nest. The aracaris are unusual for toucans in that they roost socially throughout the year, up to six adults and fledged young sleeping in the same hole with tails folded over their backs. =Food and feeding= This species is primarily an arboreal fruit-eater, but will also take insects, lizards, eggs, and other small prey.

The evidence for benefit with a kidney stone is better when the stone is larger. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, sleeplessness, nausea, blurry vision, and sexual problems. Other side effects may include feeling lightheaded with standing and angioedema. Tamsulosin is an alpha blocker and works by relaxing muscles in the prostate. Specifically it is an α1 adrenergic receptor blocker. Tamsulosin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, the wholesale cost per dose is less than US$0.10 as of 2018. In the United Kingdom, it costs the NHS 0.04 pounds per dose as of 2018. In 2017, it was the 35th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 20 million prescriptions.  Medical uses  Flomax 0.4 mg oral capsule Tamsulosin is primarily used for benign prostatic hyperplasia and to help with the passage of kidney stones. Tamsulosin, however, appears to be effective only for stones over 4 mm and less than 10 mm in size. Tamsulosin is also used as an add-on treatment for acute urinary retention. People may void more successfully after catheter removal if they are taking tamsulosin. People taking tamsulosin also are less likely to need re-catheterization. Tamsulosin does not decrease the overall size of the prostate in men with BPH, and is not recommended for prevention of prostate cancer. = Combination therapy = The results of the CombAT (combination of dutasteride (Avodart) and tamsulosin, under the brand name Duodart) trial in 2008 demonstrated that treatment with the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin provides greater symptom benefits compared to monotherapy with either agent alone for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The CombAT trial became the medication Jalyn. It was approved by the FDA on 14 June 2010.FDA approval letter at FDA.gov This combination can be useful because it may take up to six months for symptomatic relief to be found when using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride compared to alpha-1 receptor blockers, which can provide relief in some cases within 48 hours.Australian Medicines Handbook  Adverse effects  * Immunologic: Higher risk of allergic reaction in those with sulfa allergies. * Eyes: People taking tamsulosin are prone to a complication known as floppy iris syndrome during cataract surgery. Adverse outcomes of the surgery are greatly reduced by the surgeon's prior knowledge of the person's history with this drug, and thus having the option of alternative techniques.Medscape, Good Cataract Surgery Outcomes Possible in Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Due to Tamsulosin. * Severe hypotension. * Persons with cardiac conditions including hypotension, mechanical heart failure (valvular, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis), and congestive heart failure should be monitored carefully while taking tamsulosin. * Alpha blockers, including prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or tamsulosin, do not appear to affect all-cause mortality in heart failure re-hospitalization in those also receiving β-blockers. *Tamsulosin can also cause retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen is redirected to the urinary bladder instead of being ejaculated normally. This is because tamsulosin relaxes the muscles of the urethral sphincters, which are normally closed during ejaculation. This side effect can be mitigated by regular pelvic floor (Kegel) exercise and contracting the pelvic floor during ejaculation.  Mechanism  Tamsulosin is a selective α1 receptor antagonist that has preferential selectivity for the α1A receptor in the prostate versus the α1B receptor in the blood vessels. When alpha 1 receptors in the bladder neck, the prostate, the ureter, and the urethra are blocked, a relaxation in smooth muscle tissue results. This mechanism decreases resistance to urinary flow, reduces discomfort associated with BPH, and facilitates passage of kidney stones. Selective action of tamsulosin in alpha 1A/D receptors is controversial and over three quarters of tamsulosin registered human studies are unpublished. Brand names Tamsulosin was first marketed in 1996 under the trade name Flomax. The U.S. patent expired in October 2009. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved generics in March 2010. In 2010, tamsulosin was available as OTC medication in UK. It is now marketed by various companies under licence, including Boehringer Ingelheim and CSL. Tamsulosin hydrochloride extended-release capsules are marketed under the trade names Urimax 0.4(India), Flomax, Flomaxtra, Contiflo XL, bestflo, Mecir LP (France), Urimax and Pradif, although generic, non-modified-release capsules are still approved and marketed in many countries (such as Canada). Generic extended-release tablets are marketed in most countries of the EEA. In Mexico, it is marketed as Secotex and as Harnal D in Japan and Indonesia and as Harnal OCAS (oral controlled absorption system) in Thailand. In Egypt, Italy, Russia and Iceland, it is marketed under the trade name Omnic by Astellas Pharma Europe. The largest manufacturer of tamsulosin, drug substance, is Synthon BV (The Netherlands). Tamsulosin hydrochloride is marketed in Bangladesh under the trade names Uromax, Prostanil MR, Tamisol MR, Tamsin.

Unlike most popular music documentaries, the subject himself is not seen in the film in any way; instead, various critics, disc jockeys and journalists, many of whom have had some contact with the notoriously reclusive artist, discuss Jandek, his equally mysterious independent record label Corwood Industries, and his music (which reached 39 albums at the end of 2004). While Jandek himself does not appear in the movie (except in the form of the pictures on many of his album covers and in excerpts from the only phone interview he has ever done in his career, with musician and writer John Trubee for Spin Magazine in 1985), he did authorize and endorse the project through Corwood Industries (any correspondence to the artist is usually signed \\"Corwood\\" rather than \\"Jandek\\"), allow the filmmakers to use whatever recordings from his discography they saw fit, and suggest people that could be interviewed for the documentary. The film ends with the mention of the release of his 2002 album I Threw You Away; after the film's release in theaters, this album and its succeeding four releases are excerpted in a bonus feature on the DVD. The film only saw limited theatrical release, as the producers planned to distribute the film primarily as a DVD.

The town is situated in the southern part of the Kyustendil Valley, near the borders of Serbia and North Macedonia; 90 km southwest of Sofia, 130 km northeast of Skopje and 243 km north of Thessaloniki. The population is 44,532, with a Bulgarian majority and a Roma minority. During the Iron Age, a Thracian settlement was located within the town, later known as Roman in the 1st century AD. In the Middle Ages, the town switched hands between the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria and Serbia, prior to Ottoman annexation in 1395. After centuries of Ottoman rule, the town became part of an independent Bulgarian state in 1878.

SCAR Composite Antarctic Gazetteer.  History  = Prehistory and Roman era = A Thracian settlement was founded at the place of the modern town in the 5th-4th centuries BC and was known for its asclepion, a shrine dedicated to medicine god Asclepius. Under the name Pautalia ( or Πανταλία) it was a town in the district of Dentheletica. Its position in the Peutinger Table places Pautalia at Kyustendil; and the situation of this town at the sources of the Strymon agrees remarkably with the figure of a river-god, accompanied by the \\"legend\\" Στρύμων (\\"Strymon\\"), on some of the autonomous coins of Pautalia, as well as with the letters ΕΝ. ΠΑΙΩ. (\\"En. Paio\\"), which, on other coins, show that the inhabitants considered themselves to be Paeonians, like the other inhabitants of the banks of that river. On another coin of Pautalia, the productions of its territory are alluded to, namely, gold, silver, wine, and corn.Joseph Hilarius Eckhel, Doctrina numorum veterum, vol. ii. p. 38 In the reign of Hadrian, the people both of Pautalia and Serdica added Ulpia to the name of their town, probably in consequence of some benefit received from that emperor. Stephanus of Byzantium has a district called Paetalia (Παιταλία), which he assigns to Thrace, probably a false reading. Plan of the fortress Velbazhd In the 1st century AD, it was administratively part of Macedonia. Later the city was part of the province of Dacia Mediterranea and the third largest city in the province. The Roman fortress of Pautalia of the 2nd to 4th century had an area of over 29 hectares (appr. 72 acres). The fortress wall was built mainly of granite blocks and unusually its façade was supported with pillars and arches behind. The wall was 2.5m wide allowing small catapults to be mounted atop. A second, smaller fortress of area 2 hectares was built in the town in the 4th century (known by its later Ottoman name Hisarlaka). Many Thracian and Roman objects are exhibited in the town's Regional History Museum, most notably an impressive numismatic collection. Recent excavations have revealed an early Christian, late Roman monumental bishop's palace.Archaeology in Bulgaria: http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/04/28/archaeologists-discover-residence- of-early-christian-bishop-of-ancient-roman-city-pautalia-in-bulgarias- kyustendil/#more-10595 = Middle Ages = The town was mentioned under the Slavic name of Velbazhd (Велбъжд, meaning \\"camel\\") in a 1019 charter by the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. It became a major religious and administrative centre of the Byzantine Empire, and subsequently the Second Bulgarian Empire after Kaloyan conquered the area between 1201 and 1203. Battle of Velbazhd, a frescoe in the Visoki Dečani In 1282, Serbian king Stefan Milutin defeated the Byzantine Empire and conquered Velbazhd. In 1330, the Serbs defeated the Bulgarians in the vicinity, effectively keeping the region to the Serbian Kingdom. Serbian magnate Dejan, one of the prominent figures of the Serbian Empire and its subsequent fall, had initially held a large province in the Kumanovo region under Dušan, and was later as despot under Uroš V assigned the Upper Struma river with Velbuzhd.Mihaljčić 1989, pp. 79-81Fajfric, 42 Upon Dejan's death, his possessions in Žegligovo and Upper Struma were given to his two sons, Jovan Dragaš (d. 1378) and Konstantin (d. 1395). The Dejanović brothers ruled a spacious province in eastern Macedonia,Samardzic 1892 p. 22: in the southern lands of the Empire, and remained loyal to Uroš V,Fine 1994, p. 358 until 1373, when Orhan Gazi's Ottoman army compelled Jovan to recognize Ottoman vassalage.Edition de l'Académie bulgare des sciences, 1986, \\"Balkan studies, Vol. 22\\", p. 38 = Ottoman era = 1908 Kyustendil The city was a sanjak centre initially in Rumelia governorate-general, after that in the Bitola and Niš vilayets (province). It was a kaza centre in the Sofia sanjak of Danube Province until the creation of the Principality of Bulgaria in 1878. = Modern = The residents of Kyustendil took an active part in the Bulgarian National Revival and crafts and trade flourished. The town was liberated from Ottoman rule on 29 January 1878.  Demographics  = Population and ethnicity = According to the latest 2011 census data, people who chose to declare their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: Population on 1 February 2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical Institute Population by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 1 February 2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute * Bulgarians: 36,732 (82.5%) * Roma: 5,179 (11.6%) * Turks: 2 (0.0%) * Others: 143 (0.3%) * Indefinable: 296 (0.7%) ** Undeclared: 2,161 (4.9%) Total: 44,513 Roma people are mainly concentrated within the town limits. In the meantime, about a fourth of Bulgarians live in the surrounding villages, also part of the Municipality of Kyustendil. = Religion = Kyustendil today belongs to the Sofia diocese in regards of Orthodox church- administrative structure. The city is the center of the vicarage and the Kyustendil Eparchy; in the past, Kyustendil was the seat of the diocese, that latter was closed in 1884. The majority of the urban population profess the Orthodox faith today. There are several Christian denominations associated with Protestantism and a small Jewish community. During Ottoman rule Kyustendil had mostly Turkish population professing Islam, but of the many mosques of the time, now only two remain. Today the city has only Christian churches operating. In Antiquity, Pautalia was a bishopric in the Roman province of Dacia Mediterranea, suffragan to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Sardica, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Its only recorded residential bishop was * Evangelius, who was summoned to Constantinople by Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus in 516 during the controversy against Monophysitism. During the brief Late Medieval period, when the Bulgarian Church entered in full communion with Rome (instead of Orthodox Constantinople), one of its three 'Uniate Catholic' (equivalent to modern Eastern Catholic) sees was Velebusdus, which was even raised to a Metropolitan Latin Archbishopric as Pope Innocent III sent its incumbent Athanasius the archiepiscopal pallium on 25 February 1204.  Latin Titular see  The archdiocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin Metropolitan Titular archbishopric of Velebusdus (Latin) / Velebusdo (Curiate Italian) / Velesdien(sis) (Latin adjective).

Economy  The city is the center of light and manufacturing industry: logging, footwear, knitwear, ready-made clothes, toys, packaging, alcohol producers, bakery, printing and canning industries. There are companies for the production of condensers, power transformers, household and kitchen furniture and joinery. Hotels and tourism have evolved in recent years. The region has traditions in fruit growing and trade in fresh and dried fruits. Kyustendil is a center of an agricultural area with centuries-old traditions in the field of fruit growing, which is why the town and its surroundings are known as the \\"Orchard Garden of Bulgaria\\".  Geography  Kyustendil is a national balneological resort at an altitude of 600 metres. There are more than 40 mineral springs in the town. The waters have a high content of sulfite compounds. These are used for the treatment of the locomotory system, gynecological and other kinds of diseases. The resort region includes several baths, balneological complexes and others. Kyustendil is located at the foot of the Osogovo mountain, on both banks of the Banshtica River and is a well-known centre of balneology and fruit growing. The town is 90 kilometres southwest of Sofia, 69 km northwest of Blagoevgrad and 22 km from the border with North Macedonia and Serbia. The fortress was built by the Romans. Thermae, basilicas, floor mosaics have been uncovered.Adrian Room, \\"Placenames of the World\\" McFarland & Company (2005) = Climate = Kyustendil has a mediterranean climate with continental influence (because of the Struma river).

Their primary operating region is in most states east of the Mississippi River. The chain is based in Bridgewater, Pennsylvania. All of the ice cream is made fresh in the stores in order to avoid ice crystal formation. The recipe book that Bruster's uses consists of over 170 recipes with many seasonal favorites. Bruster's also makes a variety of handmade ice cream cakes as well as homemade waffle cones.  History  A Bruster's in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Bruce Reed got his start with the ice cream business in the 1950s, when, as a child, he helped out his parents at their diner, Jerry's Curb Service, in Bridgewater, Pennsylvania, a small town located 27 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. It was through this experience that Reed would learn from his dad the secrets to the restaurant business. In 1989, Reed opened an ice-cream shop right next door to Jerry's. Then Reed began operating under the Bruster's name after 15 months in the business Bruster's also began franchising and has outlets in Alabama, Arizona, Southern California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Guyana, and recently in South Korea as well. Bruster's remains headquartered in Bridgewater.

The orthodox understood this to mean that he was claiming to be God himself, whereas he had proclaimed in his sublime spiritual ecstasy, simply a total annihilation of himself. Mansoor Al-Hallaj climbed the gallows with his head held high, not the least daunted by his imminent death. Nor could his shouts be drowned in the tumult of abuses which were hurled at him; they rose loud and clear and high Anā al-Ḥaqq, Anā al-Ḥaqq until his soul departed to the fountainhead of his life on high. Remarks Basheer draws parallel between \\"Anā al-Ḥaqq\\" and Aham Brahmasmi the Upanishad Mahāvākya which means I am Brahman (the Ultimate Reality in Hinduism). Basheer uses this term to intend God is found within one's 'self'. The story is written in such a way as to attack the orthodox practices in Islam. In the edition of Anargha Nimisham which was published in 1982, Basheer added a note saying that \\"This story was written some forty years back. Now I believe that ordinary human beings who are just the products of the All Mighty saying things like \\"I am God\\" is a sin. I had also claimed that the work is based on a real story, but now; take it just as a fantasy\\". This is considered as a marked change from his earlier convictions. Critics contended that Basheer had become more religious towards his later life, contradicting some of his earlier works. He did not leave even this note without a touch of humour; this note too ended with Anā al-Ḥaqq, similar to that of the protagonist of the story. References 2\\\\.

It was also used as a ship by the New Zealand Naval Forces during World War I; as His Majesty's New Zealand Hospital Ship No. 1. It was washed ashore on Fraser Island by a cyclone in 1935 where the disintegrating wreck remains as a popular tourist attraction. Construction The 5,000-ton steel-hulled ship was built by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton, Scotland, and launched on 19 June 1905. At 400 feet in length and 50 feet in the beam, it was powered by three Parsons turbines, giving a speed of 17.5 knots. It could carry up to 420 passengers: 240 in 1st class, 120 in 2nd and 60 in 3rd, and also had a refrigerated cargo hold. Accommodation for first class passengers included a dining room, smoking room, and music room with Bechstein grand piano. The ship was lit by electricity, and was fitted with all the latest safety equipment, which included Clayton sulphur dioxide fire extinguishers. Service history The ship entered service on 18 November 1905, and was employed on routes between Sydney and Melbourne via ports in New Zealand and Hobart, Tasmania. She also made regular voyages between Sydney and Vancouver. =World War I= The New Zealand hospital ship Maheno During World War I Maheno was converted into a hospital ship using money raised by an appeal by the Earl of Liverpool, the Governor-General. It was fitted with eight wards and two operating theatres, and had a medical team consisting of five doctors and 61 orderlies from the Army Medical Corps, a matron, thirteen nursing sisters, from the newly formed New Zealand Army Nursing Service and chaplains. In accordance with Article 5 of the 1899 Hague Convention it was repainted white overall, with a broad green stripe along its sides, and large red crosses on the sides and funnels. HMNZHS Maheno arrived at Moudros, the naval base of the Gallipoli Campaign, on 25 August 1915, and the next day was off ANZAC Cove, loading casualties from the Battle of Hill 60. Over the next three months, it carried casualties from Gallipoli to Malta. They were cared for by members of the New Zealand Army Nursing Service including Evelyn Brooke. Maheno arrived back at New Zealand on 1 January 1916 to refit, then returned to Egypt in February to collect patients for transport back to New Zealand. It then sailed to the UK, arriving at Southampton on 3 July 1916, just after the start the Battle of the Somme. Until October 1916 it operated in the English Channel, returning large numbers of wounded and sick troops from the Western Front to England. Maheno sailed back to New Zealand in December 1916, and then made six more voyages between New Zealand and the British Isles, bringing back patients. There were criticisms of the Maheno making several trips to New Zealand to refit or to transport wounded soldiers home when most could have gone in a troopship; and also that the ship has being run by the Governor (Liverpool) as \\"His Exc’s pet patriotic hobby.\\" The Chief Medical Officer was William Collins on its first voyage and James Elliott on its second and third voyages. In 1915 Collins \\"raised hackles by denying nurses their officer status and deluding himself that he could command the ship’s commander, the master\\" (Captain McLean). In 1917 British Major Gretton was critical of the staff and said “he (Liverpool) puts his friends on the ship when they want soft jobs”. The ship’s nickname is “Liverpool’s yacht”. The complaint got as far as the Secretary of State for the Colonies; Liverpool said Gratton behaved like a cad. At the War's end in November 1918 Maheno was released from military service and returned to its business owner, whereupon resumed its commercial life. = Running aground on Fraser Island= The Maheno beached The hulk of Maheno in 2007 The hulk of Maheno in 2013 At the end of its commercial life, on 3 July 1935 Maheno left Sydney under tow by the 1,758 ton ship Oonah, a former Tasmanian Steamers Pty. Ltd. Bass Strait ferry, built in 1888, which along with the Maheno had been sold to the shipbreaker's yard Miyachi K.K.K. in Osaka, Japan. The ships were linked by a wire rope. On the afternoon of 7 July, about 50 miles from the coast, the towline parted in a cyclone. Attempts to re-attach the towline failed in the heavy seas, and the Maheno, with a skeleton crew of eight men aboard, drifted off and disappeared. The Oonah, with its steering gear temporarily disabled, broadcast a radio message requesting assistance for Maheno, whose propellers had been removed. Maheno was subsequently found on 10 July by an aircraft piloted by Keith Virtue, beached off the coast of Fraser Island. The crew had set up camp onshore, waiting for the Oonah to arrive, which it did on 12 July. The wreck was also the location of the marriage of Dudley Weatherley and Beatrice McLean (instead of at Townsville), at the invitation of Captain Takaka, to notes from the ship's Bechstein piano. The ship was subsequently stripped of its fittings, but attempts to refloat her failed. The wreck was subsequently offered for sale, but no buyers could be found for it. Wreck Maheno has remained at the location since, slowly corroding away. Due to the now dangerous condition of the ship access is prohibited. The Australian Department of Defence lists the wreck as a site of unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination, even though there are no records of it being used as a live firing target, or of any UXO being ever recovered from the site.

Originally a native of Europe, it has become widespread in the United States. Perennial in USDA plant hardiness zones 5 to 8. A small-growing form is known as dwarf catchfly. The name comes from the way in which small insects are trapped by the sticky sap exuded onto the stem. However it is not currently regarded as a carnivorous plant, though it has been identified as a carnivorous plant in the past.Williams, Amy. (1913). Carnivorous plants of Ohio.

He co-founded Sue Records which launched the career of Ike & Tina Turner. Subsidiary labels under the Sue were Symbol, Broadway, Eastern and Crackerjack. Murray recorded artists, including Don Covay, Jimmy McGriff, Inez Foxx, and Baby Washington, as well as releasing solo records.  Life and career  Murray was born in Charleston, South Carolina and raised in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan. His nickname, \\"Juggy\\", derived from his near-blind grandfather, who would ask Murray to bring his favorite jug and fill it up with liquor. Murray worked in real estate in Harlem before he and producer Bobby Robinson co-founded Sue Records in 1957. Initially, they intended to sell R&B; music to the African-American in New York, but in 1958 with \\"Itchy Twitchy Feeling\\" by Bobby Hendricks was a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1960, Murray signed Ike & Tina Turner to Sue Records. He offered a $25,000 advance for a four-year contract after hearing their demo. Their debut single, \\"A Fool in Love\\", peaked at No. 2 on the R&B; chart and crossed over into Hot 100. Their success continued with a string of hits, including \\"I Idolize You,\\" \\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine,\\" and \\"Poor Fool.\\" Murray even managed them for a period. In 1962, Ike & Tina Turner along with Placid Music Corporation sued Murray, Sue Records and Sue's publishing affiliate Saturn Music for breach of contract and royalties. In 1962, Murray signed Barbara George to the label. He paid $25,000 for her contract from A.F.O. Records. A.F.O. Records was distributed by Sue. As the Sixties progressed, Sue's sub labels produced hits such as \\"Mockingbird\\" by brother- and-sister duo Inez & Charlie Foxx and \\"She Blew a Good Thing\\" by The Poets on Symbol Records. In July 1965, Murray signed guitarist Jimi Hendrix to an exclusive two-year contract to Sue Records, but no recordings were released. Sue was originally licensed by Decca Records and issued on London Records until 1964, after Murray reached an agreement with Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records. After a breach of contract involving Decca issuing recordings which weren't affiliated with Sue, Murray terminated their agreement and returned to Decca in 1966. In 1968, Murray took a $100,000 loan from United Artists that was secured by Sue assets. After failing to pay off the debt, United Artists assumed ownership of Sue Records masters and Saturn Music publishing. He also lost the \\"Sue building\\" which consisted of offices and Juggy Sound Studio in Manhattan. Murray moved to California and recorded a few singles. In the 1970s, he launched Juggernaught and Jupiter Records. He released his debut album Inside America on his Jupiter label in 1976, which was popular on the UK dancefloors. The title track made the Top Forty in Britain. That album was followed by Rhythm and Blues in 1977. He continued to work into the new millennium, producing and promoting up and coming artists. Speaking of Baby Washington, Murray once said, \\"I would rather record her than eat.\\"  Death  Murray died on February 8, 2005, at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York. Though Murray was 81 and suffering from Parkinson's disease, he and Baby Washington had been working on recording comeback material.

The flowers are produced in capitula (flowerheads) 6–12 mm diameter with pale pink ray florets and darker pink disc florets. It is dioecious, but can also reproduce without fertilisation. It is found in groups which can be all-female colonies, all-male colonies, and also mixed colonies. The male plants have whiter flower heads than female plants.  Uses  While not widely used in herbal medicine, the plant was believed to have antitussive, astringent, diuretic and emollient properties. It has been traditionally used to treat bronchitis, liver and gall bladder complaints, hepatitis and diarrhea. Externally, it has been used as a gargle for treating tonsillitis and as a douche for vaginitis. John Gerard's Herball (1597) describes the plant: \\"When the flower hath long flourished and is waxen old, then comes there in the middest of the floure a certain brown yellow thrumme, such as is in the middest of the daisie, which floure being gathered when it is young may be kept in such manner (I meane in such freshness and well- liking) by the space of a whole year after in your chest or elsewhere, wherefore our English women have called it 'Live Long,' or 'Live-for ever,' which name doth aptly answer this effects.\\" Antennariadioeca.jpg References *Flora Europaea: Antennaria dioica distribution in Europe *Germplasm Resources Information Network: Antennaria dioica dioica Dioecious plants Flora of temperate Asia Flora of Europe Flora of Alaska Plants described in 1753 Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Antennaria dioica"},{"id":"2942057","text":"Alderminster is a village and civil parish on the River Stour about south of Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England.

The district headquarters of Banka is situated in Banka town. The district was established on 21 February 1991. Previously, it was the richest and largest sudivision of Bhagalpur district. History Banka is the homeland of the revolutionary Satish Prasad Jha, one of seven martyrs who hoisted the flag of India at the Secretariat building near Patna on 11 August 1942. Jha was born in Kharhara near Dhakamod. Bhubaneswar Mishra, a noted regional revolutionary from village Faga has contributed a lot in the freedom movement. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing many cruel British forces. Banka has been an attractive destination for veteran socialists. Madhu Limaye represented the Banka Lok Sabha constituency twice. George Fernandes and Raj Narain also contested the parliamentary election in this constituency. There were also a number of veteran leaders of the Indian National Congress: Vindhyavasini Devi, MLA (1957–1967); Shakuntala Devi, ex MP; ex-chief minister of Bihar Chandrashekhar Singh, Chaturbhuj Singh Ex. MLA; ex-Rajya Sabha MP Kamakhya Prasad Singh, ex-MP Manorama Singh; and ex-MLA Jai Prakash Mishra. Digvijay Singh (14 November 1955 – 24 June 2010) was an independent who represented Banka in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. Banka played a vital role in the freedom of India. Banka became a district on 21 February 1991. Digvijay Singh served as a Member of the Parliament of India five times – three times in the Lok Sabha (1998, 1999, and 2009) and two times in the Rajya Sabha (1990 and 2004). He served as Union Minister of State during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government (1999–2004) and the Chandra Shekhar government (1990–1991). He was also a successful sports administrator, having served as President of the National Rifle Association of India since 1999. He was one of the three (George Fernandes, Digvijay Singh, and Nitish Kumar) founding members of the Samta Party. Now, Gridhari Yadav is the member of parliament from this constituency. Geography The district, part of Bhagalpur division, has its headquarters in Banka town. Banka district occupies an area of , comparatively equivalent to Canada's Akimiski Island. Chanan is the main river of Banka. Barua is the second main river near Dubaa village in Banka. Economy Banka is gradually becoming a religious tourism hotspot for Hinduism and Jainism. Old Mandar Parvat (also known as Mandarachal Parvat in Puran) is home to many religious attractions. A Jain temple at the summit, in close proximity to a Vishnu temple, is a sign of religious tolerance. Every year in January, Bounsi Mela is organised, which depicts the village life of the Mandar region. A Ratha-Yatra procession of Lord Madhusudanah occurs every year on the same day as the Ratha-Yatra procession in Puri. Fourteenth-century Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu started this Ratha-Yatra during his visit to Mandar. Banka is a largely agrarian economy and is considered the \\"rice bowl\\" of Bihar. The main crops are rice, wheat, corn, and lentils. The Amarpur belt produces sugar cane and is home to gur sugar mills. An issue for many smaller village industries in Bihar is the lack of branding for products. High-quality, locally produced goods, even in large volumes, contribute to lower earnings for business owners because of a lack of awareness of more profitable business practices. Banka is strategically located near the source of raw materials for heavy industries. Its proximity to Jharkhand (bordering Deoghar, Dumka, and Godda) and the River Chandan makes it a very strong contender for coal-based power plant investment and other heavy industry. There is a 4000 MW thermal power plant is planned in Kakwara village. Abhijeet Group has planned to built a 1320 MW thermal power plant at Baunsi. Ericsson Power Ltd has planned to set up a 1320 MW thermal power plant at Prabhawati Nagar. Dalmia Power has planned to set up a 1320 MW coal-based thermal power project in Dona village. In 2006, the Indian government named Banka one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 38 districts in Bihar currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).  Education  Banka district has one Government college, PBS College. Other colleges and universities include DNS College, Pt Tarni Jha Women College, and Shyama Charan Vidyapeeth. Subdivisions and Blocks The district comprises only one subsdivision, Banka, which is further divided into eleven blocks: Banka, Amarpur, Shambhuganj, Belhar, Fullidumar, Katoria, Chandan, Baunsi, Barahat, Dhoraiya, and Rajoun. Transport A railway line connecting the existing Bhagalpur-Bounsi line to Rampurhat, which is well-connected to Howrah, is being developed, as is a line connecting Sultanganj to Jasidih through Banka. Banka is also connected to Patna, the capital of Bihar, from the railway line. Jagatpur village should be included where railway station Banka is situated. Demographics According to the 2011 Indian census, Banka district has a population of 2,034,763, roughly equal to the nation of Slovenia or the US state of New Mexico. This gives it a ranking of 228th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate from 2001-2011 was 26.14%.

He was born at Bromley Common, Kent and died in Mayfair, London. The Norman family have a long history in English banking.

His older brother Charles, also a first-class cricketer, became a merchant banker too with Baring Brothers. He was appointed High Sheriff of Hertfordshire for 1899. Cricket career Norman was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played in the Eton v Harrow cricket matches in four seasons from 1854 to 1857 as a right-handed middle-order batsman. At Cambridge University in 1858 he went straight into the first team for cricket and in his first first-class match, against the Cambridge Town Club, he made 100, putting on 160 for the fourth wicket with William Benthall who made 103 and was also making his first-class cricket debut. He retained his place in the Cambridge side across the season and was picked for the University Match against Oxford University; in this game, he top-scored for Cambridge with 43 in the first innings but failed, with the rest of the side, in the second innings when the whole team was dismissed for just 39. At the end of the university cricket season, Norman was picked for the 1858 Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, which the Players team won decisively. Right at the end of the season, he played a single game for Kent which Sussex, largely through the bowling of John Wisden and Jemmy Dean, also won easily. In neither of these games did he reach double figures. Norman retained his place in the Cambridge first team through 1859 and 1860 and was captain in the second of these years, leading his team to victory in the 1860 University Match, which was a very low-scoring game. He also appeared in intermittent matches for Kent through to 1864. His second century and highest first-class score was an innings of 103 for the Gentlemen of Kent team against the Gentlemen of England in 1859. His final first-class game was for an amateur side in 1866, but he played for the I Zingari nomadic amateur side through to the 1870s.

The game features stylized boxers in polygon-based graphics, composed of triangles, some with names suggestive of non-fictional people. All opponent boxers have different fighting styles — some prefer to attack, some to counter-attack. Some (like Smokin' Joe Blow) have great punching power, some have amazing speed; The Champ has nearly perfect attributes. The game is regarded as one of earliest, and possibly first, examples of a 3D head-to-head fighting game. During the game, the player can choose which attributes to improve in his avatar: speed, power or stamina. While fighting, different tactics and strategies can be used, like all-out attacks, counter-attacks, dodging, etc. Sometimes fights end in a unanimous decision, even 15 round fights. Draws and disqualifications are also possibilities. Development Its first version, 1.0, was published by Mindscape in June 1991. The game was released for PC, Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga and Fujitsu FM Towns Marty. The Macintosh version has slightly improved graphics, but a smaller screen size. A second version, 2.0, was published in February 1992. Version 2.0 was the \\"Electronic Arts\\" version which had different music, introductions, and pupils added to the boxers' eyes. The FM Towns Marty version was based on Version 2 but with higher quality sound. Reception Computer Gaming World stated that the polygon graphics were strange-looking but very accurately modeled boxers' bodies and punches. The magazine concluded that \\"4D Boxing is an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable game with an effective representation of boxing skills ... a welcome and often-played addition to any sports game library\\".

It is often used as a shortcut for long-distance traffic along U.S. Route 93, bypassing the longer and less direct route U.S. Route 93 follows between Ely and Crystal Springs. The highway was established in the 1930s as State Route 38 and State Route 38A, and was renumbered to SR 318 in 1976. At a total of , it is the longest state route in Nevada. The road is used for open speed highway races twice a year. Route description First reassurance sign along southbound SR 318 SR 318 begins on U.S. Route 93 (US 93) at Crystal Springs in Lincoln County. From there, it travels north through Hiko. SR 318 generally parallels the route of the White River on its trek northward. The highway travels through Nye County and the town of Sunnyside. The highway then enters White Pine County and serves the community of Lund. SR 318 ends at a junction on US 6 approximately southwest of Ely. The racing video game Need for Speed: ProStreet features a portion of the highway as a racing track for Speed Challenges. History Looking north on SR 318 towards Lund A county road approximating the course of the present highway was indicated on state maps by 1933. As of 1935, State Route 38 was designated along the north end of the county road, between State Route 4 (later US 6) at Barnes and the town of Lund. This segment of highway was completely paved by 1936. The remaining unimproved portions of the county road was made part of the state highway system by 1937—the from US 93 to Hiko became the first iteration of SR 60, while the remaining was designated SR 38A. By 1939, however, SR 60 was removed and replaced by SR 38A—the southern end of the route was also shifted more easterly by this time. In 1942, the entire length of SR 38A between US 93 and Lund had been graded to more closely follow the White River. The SR 38A designation was completely absorbed into SR 38 by 1946—by this time, SR 38 was approximately long. SR 38 would remain relatively unchanged, except for gradual pavement upgrades, for several years. However, on July 1, 1976, Nevada began a major renumbering of all its state highway system. In that process, SR 38 was rechristened as the new State Route 318. The changes were first noted on the 1978 edition of the official state highway map. The route number conversion was completed by 1982—by that time, the entire highway was completely paved. At the request of White Pine County's Board of Tourism and Recreation, the Nevada Board of Transportation renamed SR 318 from \\"Sunnyside Road\\" to the \\"Silver State Classic Challenge Highway\\" on May 24, 2012. More than 100 miles of the highway, between Lund, Nevada and Hiko, Nevada are closed twice a year for the Nevada Open Road Challenge and Silver State Classic Challenge road races. On June 24, 2020, part of the highway was closed near Lund, Nevada as the Brown Fire grew, burning almost parallel to the highway.

All organisms, from bacteria to humans, display maladaptive and adaptive traits. In animals (including humans), adaptive behaviors contrast with maladaptive ones. Like adaptation, maladaptation may be viewed as occurring over geological time, or within the lifetime of one individual or a group. It can also signify an adaptation that, whilst reasonable at the time, has become less and less suitable and more of a problem or hindrance in its own right, as time goes on. This is because it is possible for an adaptation to be poorly selected or become less appropriate or even become on balance more of a dysfunction than a positive adaptation, over time. Note that the concept of maladaptation, as initially discussed in a late 19th-century context, is based on a flawed view of evolutionary theory. It was believed that an inherent tendency for an organism's adaptations to degenerate would translate into maladaptations and soon become crippling if not \\"weeded out\\" (see also Eugenics). In reality, the advantages conferred by any one adaptation are rarely decisive for survival on its own but rather balanced against other synergistic and antagonistic adaptations, which consequently cannot change without affecting others. In other words, it is usually impossible to gain an advantageous adaptation without incurring \\"maladaptations\\". Consider a seemingly trivial example: it is apparently extremely hard for an animal to evolve the ability to breathe well in air and in water. Better adapting to one means being less able to do the other. Examples * During periods of climate change—such as cooling or the currently experienced global warming—species that were well adapted in the original climate may be maladapted to the new climate and die out, if they are prevented from shifting their range due to geological barriers. * Resistance to antibiotics is usually an adaptation/maladaption issue from the point of view of infective agents: the initial disease agents are well adapted to the physiological conditions of their host and can proliferate. When antibiotics are employed, those organisms that have no or little resistance against them are at a disadvantage. However, being able to detoxify antibiotics comes at a price: the mechanisms conferring antibiotic resistance (e.g. beta-lactamase) are rarely useful for any other purpose. Hence, energy that would otherwise be available to grow and reproduce is diverted for antibiotics detoxification. To an infective organism, it is thus a trade-off between being able to outgrow resistant strains in the absence of antibiotics, and being able to detoxify antibiotics if these are encountered. An evolutionarily stable strategy is thus not possible, if antibiotics are not used indiscriminately. * Dodos were able to cope with the climate conditions on Mauritius. There, during parts of the year semiarid conditions predominate, and plants produce relatively little biomass that dodos would have used as food (such as fruits), whereas in the wet season there is an overabundance of food. Dodos apparently adapted to this by building up fat deposits when food was plentiful, and adjusting their breeding cycle to climate conditions. Confronted with humans and introduced predators, this proved ultimately fatal: humans would believe the fat dodos were good to eat and would hunt them, or simply kill them for fun because of their funny appearance and awkward movements. The breeding cycle, which originally ensured that as little effort as possible was invested in reproduction made them vulnerable to the introduced pigs and monkeys, as there was little possibility for a dodo whose egg had been destroyed to re-nest before the year's reproductive season was over. *A term used known as neuroplasticity is defined as \\"the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life\\".Neuroplasticity. (n.d.). MedicineNet. Web. 12 Nov. 2014, from http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40362 Neuroplasticity is seen as an adaptation that helps humans to adapt to new stimuli, especially through motor functions in musically inclined people, as well as several other hand-eye coordination activities. An example of maladaptation in neuroplasticity within the evolution of the brain is phantom pain in individuals who have lost limbs. While the brain is exceptionally good at responding to stimuli and reorganizing itself in a new way to then later respond even better and faster in the future, it sometimes is unable to cope with the loss of a limb, even though the neurological connections are lost. One journal \\"Adaptation and Maladaptation\\" found that in some cases, the changes that had previously aided the human brain to best suit an environment could also become maladaptive.Nava, E., Roder, B., & Enhancing Performance for Action and Perception. (January 01, 2011). Adaptation and maladaptation. Progress in Brain Research, 191, 177–194. In this case, with the loss of a limb, the brain is perceiving pain, though there are no nerves or signals from the now missing limb to give the brain that perception.

The first camera, the T50, was introduced in March 1983 while the final camera, the T60, was released in April 1990. All have a Canon FD lens mount compatible with Canon's extensive range of manual-focus lenses. The T series attempted to update the SLR concept. In the early 1980s, the SLR market share was declining with the increased popularity of highly automated 35 mm compact cameras; the T series introduced much more automation to the SLR camera, making it almost as easy to use as a point and shoot camera. The final model, the Canon T60, was the odd one out; it was introduced after the FD manual lens mount was already obsolete, and while it carried over a few T-series styling cues, it was a manual camera supporting only aperture priority auto-exposure. In addition, it was not even made by Canon themselves; they subcontracted the manufacture to Cosina, and the chassis itself was based upon that of the Cosina CT-1. * T50 (March 1983)Canon Camera Museum – Canon T50 * T70 (April 1984)Canon Camera Museum – Canon T70 * T80 (April 1985)Canon Camera Museum – Canon T80 * T90 (February 1986)Canon Camera Museum – Canon T90 * T60 (April 1990)Canon Camera Museum – Canon T60  References  T Series ","title":"Canon T series"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function D(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your bitcoin🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",D]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/52.md","filePath":"library/52.md"}'),x={name:"library/52.md"},L=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{F as __pageData,L as default};
