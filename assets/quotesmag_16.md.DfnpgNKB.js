The remaining 200 plus kilometres are mostly unspoiled coastal nature. The shoreline at Strands Gunger in Begtrup Bay with the wave and current made phenomena, krumodde ( spit) The shorelines of the peninsula face in all directions and are exposed to winds from all directions. This together with the varied geology of the Djursland peninsula with hills to the south and more flat land to the north, contributes to a variety in coastal nature within the limited area of Djursland. The peninsula is on average 35 kilometers long measured on the vertical axis, and about 40 kilometers on the horizontal axis, Djursland protrudes into the Kattegat Sea between Jutland in Denmark, and Sweden on the other side of the Kattegat sea. The Kattegat Sea is the gateway to the Baltic Sea. Djursland's coastline is located in a temperate coastal climate with an average summer temperature in July of 20 degrees Celsius in the day, and 12 degrees at night, and an average winter temperature in January of 5 degrees in the day and 1 degree at night (1961 ‚Äì 1990) DMI The sea temperature around Djursland is on average 17 degrees Celsius in July and August (higher close to land) and 2 degrees Celsius in February. The salinity varies somewhere between Atlantic salinity of 35 parts per thousand, and Baltic salinity of 10 ‚Äì 15 parts per thousand. The variation is due to wind and tidal driven fluctuations in the proportion of Atlantic and Baltic water around Djursland. The daily tidal difference is under 30 centimeters. When storms or heavy winds occasionally drive the water in and out of The Kattegat Sea between The Baltic and the North Sea, the tidal difference can reach over one meter. The coastline of Djursland can be divided into 4 regions: The brackish shoreline of Randers Fjord The shallow waters of the north coast The exposed stony east coast The sheltered bays to the south Brackish North Western Coast  Some places in Randers Fjord medows and swamps go directly over into the fjord without any beaches In many places access to Randers Fjord is inhibited by reed banks To the northwest the Djursland peninsula borders Randers Fjord. This narrow, 30 kilometre long wetland, cuts into mainland Jutland. The fjord is the outlet for Denmark's longest river, Guden√•. The fresh water from the river mixes with salt water in the fjord. Along the fjord meadows and swamps often go directly into the fjord without any beaches. The bottom along the coastline consists of claylike silt, and one has to go quite far out to reach any significant depth in many places. These conditions are not favourable for beach life. In many places banks of reeds reach all the way into the fjord, making it impossible to walk along the coast. This lack of accessibility is characteristic for the north eastern borders of the Djursland peninsula in Randers Fjord.[Danmarks Strandguide - Djursland] There is no recreational potential to speak of for swimming and bathing in Randers Fjord, but there is potential for boating and fishing.[Lystfisker.dk] The wetlands are also a habitat for wildlife. Sea trout and salmon migrate up the fjord to Guden√• and its tributaries.[Lystfisker.dk] A local subspecies of herring spawn in the fjord. Each spring big schools of herring migrate into the fjord all the way to Randers Harbor 30 kilometres inland.[smiff.dk/Lystfiskeri] Even though there are lots of fish in the fjord, local knowledge is often required to catch the fish, and to find the places where one can get down to the shores free of reed banks, which are also good for fishing.[smiff.dk/Lystfiskeri] By Kanal√∏en (The Channel Island) there is a bulwark in connection with a dug out shipping channel. Here it gets deep right from the bulwark. This 2.5 kilometer stretch is a nationally and internationally known place for recreational angling for herring, mainly in spring. The place lies just south of the visitors' centre, Kyst og Fjordcentret, (The Coast and Fjord Centre) and next to a ferry berth and small marina by the village, Voer. In Voer there is a ferry crossing the fjord to Mellerup with the mini ferry Ragna taking 5 minutes to cross the fjord, with a capacity of 3 ‚Äì 4 cars at a time. Just north of the Coast and Fjord Centre the coastline is accessible in waders. This is one of the good places in the fjord to catch sea trout according to the local anglers club, SMIFF. Shallow Northern Coast  The northern coastline of Djursland stretches from the mouth of Randers Fjord to Gjerrild Strand (Gjerrild Beach) in the north east corner of the peninsula. This north facing coastline is 40 kilometres long. After Gjerrild Beach the coast goes south and turns into the stony east facing coast of Djursland. Djursland's north coast is characterized by shallow sandy beaches. In most places one has to wade quite far out to reach depths suitable for swimming.[ Visitdjursland.com] Closest to mainland Jutland at St. Sj√∏rup and at Lystrup there is a semi permanent sand bar along the coast. This constitutes the actual beach for beach goers. By the shore there is hardly any beach. This is most clearly seen at St. Sj√∏rup where the sandbar lies 400 metres out parallel to the coast. Furthest to the east at Gjerrild Beach it gets deep faster. Here there are also sand dunes along the beach. The shallow waters of the north coast warm up quickly in summer, and this contributes to their recreational value, including the child friendliness of these beaches. It is safe to bathe here, when one must wade out 30 metres or more in many places to reach a depth of 20 centimetres. Being a north facing shoreline onshore winds are uncommon (from the north) in this geographical region. So there are rarely big waves, contributing further to the recreational value of the northern coastline. A semi permanent sand bar 400 metres out from the shore is used as a beach at St. Sj√∏rup on the north coast of Djursland Shallow beach at Havhuse, northern Djursland. Sunrise at midsummer Between B√∏nnerup Beach and Gjerrild Beach there is a recreational footpath along the shore. Here a wooded coastal slope goes down to the water as part of the Lillebavle and Emmedsbo Woods in the hinterland. The fact that it is covered with trees going down to a flat stretch with growth before the sea is a sign that this area is not eroding into the sea. It is characteristic for the north coast that there is no coastal erosion. Land is being added, as opposed to the east coast of Djursland where coastal erosion occurs several places. On the north coast six sandy beaches suitable for swimming are described in the Coastal Map Folder covering Djursland. Starting from the Jutlland side these beaches are, St. Sj√∏rup Strand, Lystrup Strand, Havhuse, Fjellerup Strand, B√∏nnerup Strand and Gjerrild Nordstrand. Gjerrild Nordstrand is the only one with swimming depth close to the shore. Between these beaches it is also possible to go to the beach, but here access by car can be difficult. According to Danish law all of the coastline in Denmark must be kept open to the public. There is a concentration of summer houses and summer rentals by the mentioned six beaches, and some of the places there are also campsites. Fjellerup Beach is the most visited of the six in summer, with the largest contingency of summer houses and tourist facilities. Of the northern beaches St. Sj√∏rup is closest to mainland Jutland. It's located where the coast of Djursland turns up towards Jutland 7 kilometers before Randers Fjord. One can wade out to the semi permanent sand bar 400 metres out. At St. Sj√∏rup the transition between land and sea consists of often lush salt tolerant vegetation. Often in tussocks going into the sea without any transition in the form of a beach. St. Sj√∏rup is probably one of the least known of Djursland's beaches, even though it might be seen as the most interesting from a nature area point of view, with wadden sea vegetation, and a wide and long sandbar out in the water, that has some of the classical sandy beach virtues for beach goers.  Stony East Coast Djursland's east coast is made up of often wide stony beaches. This coastline stretches 50 kilometers to the south from Gjerrild Nordstrand (Gjerrild Northern Beach) to G√•sehage (Goose Hook) to the south, where the Hasn√¶s-peninsula with the town Ebeltoft contains the southernmost part of the coastline of Djursland. Here the uninhabited Kattegat island, Hjelm, lies 6 kilometers due east of the tip of the Hasn√¶s peninsula. Glatved Strand (Glatved Beach) is a stony beach on eastern Djursland Out from the stony shores of the east coast it often gets deeper than two meters just 5 ‚Äì 10 meters from the shore. This east coast is relatively current rich with open unrestricted water all the way across the Kattegat Sea to Sweden. This generates big waves under onshore wind conditions (from the east) with a tendency to wide beaches created by waves washing up onto the shores. An exception from the eastern stony beaches is the 5 kilometer long Gren√• Strand (Gren√• Beach) This is a wide sandy beach with dunes. Another exception from the stony beaches of the east coast is the lime cliff coastline of Sangstrup and Karlby. Here the vertical lime cliffs reach all the way to the sea with only a short, or no, beach in between. On a daily basis the average difference between high and low tide is less than 30 centimeters in these waters sheltered from the Atlantic tides by the peninsula Jutland protruding up from Germany. But after storms that drive water in and out of the Baltic, the tidal difference can be over a meter. This also contributes to creation of wide beaches on the exposed east coast of Djursland. Coastal erosion and waterfall at Rug√•rd Skov (Rug√•rd Forest) Sangstrup Klint's rock-like lime with layers of flint in between are raised sea bed from the Cretaceous period Gren√• Sandy beach is an exception from the stony coastlines on eastern Djursland Djurslands east coast protrudes into the Kattegat Sea, with a tendency to coastal erosion where the land sticks furthest out into the Kattegat sea. Here hills and slopes are gradually washed away. This is the case at Gjerrild Klint to the north, Havknude south of Gren√•, the Helligkilde-headland at Glatved Beach and down from Rug√•rd Castle by Rug√•rd Wood. At Rug√•rd one can see a wooded hill consisting of ball clay with large tilted beech trees sliding into the sea. On the Coastal Map two sandy beaches for swimming are registered on the east coast of Djursland. One of them, Gren√• Beach, was selected as one of the three best beaches in Denmark in 2006. Boeslum Strand (Boeslum Beach) is the second sandy beach mentioned on the coastal map. It is located on the Hasn√¶s peninsula across from Ebeltoft. This beach is sandy with stony parts in between. The east coast of Djursland has been a source of lime extraction for at least 150 years.[Djurslands Kalk, B√∏rge Kj√¶r, 2001] In part as rock like blocks taken from heavily cracked but massive underground formations that are close to the surface on eastern Djursland. This is visible in the form of the Sangstrup- and Karlby lime cliffs, with a wall of lime down to the sea. Lime has also been dug up in the form of rounded stones from hills close to the coast. Such as by Glatved located in moraine deposits from the last ice age in a mix with gravel and sand. These rounded lime stones are also common as part of the stony beaches. Such as at Glatved, where the lime stones have been extracted from the beaches on an industrial scale. On the stony east coast rounded white limestones contribute to the visual impression of the shores in a mix with grey-black rounded flint stones. From a recreational point of view the stony east coast of Djursland is interesting for anglers and snorkelers, who are out to catch fish or do underwater photography. For this the eastern coastline is the best suited of the Djursland coasts. In part due to a varied sea bottom with stony stretches upon which sea weed can grow, mixed with sandy parts. All in all making good habitats for fish and other marine life. This is also because of the relatively current rich conditions favoring healthy oxygen levels. This combined with that it gets deep fast, facilitates varied sea life close to the shore on the east coast of Djursland. Sheltered Southern Bays  The southern coastline of Djursland is made up of bays and peninsulas. Here the hilly south Djursland meets the sea with many steep inclines down to the sea. The largest bays are: Aarhus Bugt (Aarhus Bay), Knebel Vig (Knebel Bay) Begtrup Vig (Begtrup Bay) and Ebeltoft Vig (Ebeltoft Bay) The largest peninsulas are Hasn√¶s, Helgen√¶s, and the Tved-peninsula. Often the southern coastal region lies within Mols Bjerge National Park including coastlines and some of the coastal sea-areas.[Nationalparkmolsbjerge.dk] Tved K√¶r on South Djursland is a protected coast in Knebel Bay. Knebel Bay is a side bay to √Örhus Bay On many of the southern shores there isn't much wave action, as there aren't long stretches of sea, where they can grow big before washing ashore creating beaches. Small waves make narrow beaches. Big waves make wide beaches. Southern Djursland has a mix of different types of stony and sandy beaches. In the more enclosed bays there isn't the same exchange of water as on the exposed eastern shores of Djursland facing the Kattegat Sea. As a consequence the bottom in the southern bay land is home to less fish life, and fewer species of sea weed and other marine life. At Mols Hoved (Mols Head) the sea erodes the hills. √Örhus Port can be seen in the distance across √Örhus Bay On the other hand, these coastlines have many beaches that provide good shelter. One can always find a beach sheltered from the prevailing wind direction on a given day a short drive away, no matter the wind direction. At the top of Ebeltoft Bay, as well as on the east coast of this bay, opposite the town Ebeltoft, there are several smaller sandy beaches. South facing Strands Strand (Strands Beach) in Begtrup Bay, is a regular wide sandy beach on southern Djursland. A beach that one will not find, unless one knows it's there. It is tucked away at the end of byways on the southern part of the Mols hills, with no large villages, or main roads, close by, even though there are summer houses and summer rentals down to this beach.

He is the first signatory of 19 draft laws, among which the one about the voluntary associations, the one about the local broadcasting television, about par condicio, about the regionalization of public service broadcasting, and about the conservation and protection of the rock art. Together with his friend Professor Ettore Adalberto Albertoni, Caparini has realized the program agreements for the promotion of the Roman Vallecamonica in Cividate Camuno and Bienno, for the enhancement of the historical center of Breno and its castle, for the Labor Museum in Cedegolo. During the voting for the election of the Constitutional Court's judges, leaving the urn, as a protest, he showed a banner with the words \\" Papalia is a racist and Nazi\\", referring to Guido Papalia, the prosecutor of Verona, who pursued some members of Lega Nord for the offense of incitement to racism for having collected signatures against a gypsy camp.

Irruption of Digos in Bellerio, headquarters of the Northern League in Milan on 18 September 1996. Davide Caparini with Umberto Bossi and Mario Borghezio resist the search of Roberto Maroni office. = Sebino viability = Caparini is the supporter of funding and conclusion of the new fast road called the SS 510 Sebina Orientale, whose work had been abandoned due to the failure of contractors. It has been opened in 2004. In July 1996, while the protests of citizens were becoming stronger, Caparini could find the missing 56 billion lire to finish the works. Due to Prodi's instability, the decree law allowing the award of the work was removed, and the legislative vacuum has been passed thanks to an amendment done by Caparini to the Finance Act 1997. The total amount was 100 billion lire and in October 1997, five years after the failure of contractors, the works could resume. In 1998 the lines between Marone and Vello (cost 81 billion lire) and between Bersaglio and Pilzone (cost 103 billion lire) have been completed but could not be opened to traffic because the central part of the track, the one above Sale Marasino, has not been completed. In December 1999 the Parliament with an order of the day made by Caparini, commits the Government to camuno-sebina viability. 35 billion lire miss, and the Lombardy Region allocates 24. In December 2000 several buildings in Pisogne have reported damage due to vibration and soil subsidence caused by excavation. The builder company must slow down the work. Due to limestone water infiltration, also the Pisogne variant suffers a delay. In November 1999, the citizens protest for the delay and the heavy rains in October and November 2000 worsen the situation. In May 2001, with more than four and a half years late, the Pisogne variant (Toline- Rovina) opens. The passage of the Tour of Italy leads to national public attention the danger of its galleries, which have been place of serious accidents too many times. The Minister of Public Works answers to a Caparini's Parliamentary question ensuring interventions in San Carlo and Santa Barbara galleries. The Province of Brescia works to make safe the Trentapassi Gallery and the consequent creation of an alternative road reassessing the lakefront. The Berlusconi II approves the new law about public works and allows the entrance of SS 510 in the list of strategic interventions of national importance. In 2003 many managers, entrepreneurs, officers and employees of the Milan compartment of Anas are arrested. This fact slows but does not stop the work. In February 2004 finally the Sebina Orientale road opens to traffic. = The Vallecamonica road = The situation of the viability in Vallecamonica and in Sebino, arrives in Parliament in 1996. In March 1998 the first inauguration: seven kilometers from the border between Lovere and Costa Volpino until Darfo Boario Terme. In 1999 Caparini presented the draft law about the completion of the road which links Valcamonica to the Province of Brescia and in 2000, the Parliament approved a Caparini's order of the day to finance and complete the work. In 2001 with the second Berlusconi Government, Caparini is able to unlock the latches work because of the discovery of a boulder with rock inscriptions at Badetto di Ceto and to fund some works on the SS 39 of Aprica. The stretch between Breno and Capodiponte opens. Together with the citizens' committee of Badetto di Ceto, Caparini found the resources to achieve the crossing of the town gallery in the average Vallecamonica then inaugurated in October 2005. With an amendment, Caparini puts \\"the completion of the Valcamonica system accessibility, S.S 42 ‚Äì del Tonale e della Mendola \\"in the national strategy works, providing an additional funding of 150 million euro, which will enable the financing and the conclusion. In June 2007 as a sign of protest against the Prodi Government and its delay, Caparini engages in an ultramarathon \\"Less Prodi more roads\\", lasting 6¬Ω hours along 62 kilometers that separate Iseo from Capodiponte. The last section of SS. 42 has been inaugurated and opened in December 2012. = The rules for the mountains = With the financial of 1999, Caparini manages to enter the facility on diesel fuel and LPG used in mountain areas. During the second Berlusconi government he has been working with the Minister for Regional Affairs Enrico La Loggia for the drafting of a new law for the mountain framework. In 2005 his project, made to facilitate the Italian mountain rescue (CNSAS) and the Alpine troops, becomes law. In this period he supports several local environmental committees in defense of Vallecamonica landscapes, getting the change of the route of the power line San Fiorano Gorlago and planting or dismantling of some high voltage lines. In 2006 he proposed the re- determination of water tariffs for the mountain communities as well as the increase in hydroelectric fees in favor of the inhabitants of the territories exploited by dealers. In 2006 he participated in the work for the preparation of a delegation to the Government for a code in favor of mountains and for bovine at high altitude. = Papalia and the via Bellerio facts = On 18 September 1996, just a few days after the Declaration of Independence of Padania on 15 September, the Digos frisked the offices of Via Bellerio (headquarters of Lega Nord) Umberto Bossi, Roberto Maroni, Davide Caparini and Mario Borghezio took position against the incursion. In Bellerio were seized some shirts, gadgets, and posters. Against the search warrant, the Chamber of Deputies walked appeal under Article 68 of the Constitution, which prohibits the violation of premises available to parliamentarians without consent of Parliament but Davide Caparini was condemned in 2004 by the Constitutional Court with a sentence of 6 months and 20 days.  Other activities and social commitment  From 2006 to 2013 he has been vice president of Padania Sport, today Hercules Sports Athletics & Running Team, sports club affiliated with Sport Padania (sports promotion Team recognized by CONI) and with FIDAL. Long- time marathoner, member of the Montecitorio Running Club, Caparini runs today under the insignia of Smarathon Onlus (which raises money for spinal muscular atrophy research). He has raced all the major marathons (New York, Berlin, Chicago, Tokyo, London and, in 2013, the Boston marathon, marred by a bomb attack.) In the last few years he devoted himself to the practice of Triathlon.

From 1922 he lived and worked in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and was a key figure in the architectural development of Belgrade. Life and career =Early life and education= Krasnov started attending the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1876, aged 12. As a young artist he received patronage from Sergey Tretyakov, brother of the founder of Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, and entrepreneur Petar Gubonyin. =1887-1899: Chief Architect of Yalta= Livadia Palace, Yalta 1909 In 1887 Krasnov took up the post of Chief Architect in Yalta,Milica Maƒëanoviƒá.

He had a contract for 24 years, of which he served 12. Taking up the post at the age of 23, Krasnov had large responsibility for the rapid growth of the city at the time. He started by expanding the promenade, which by 1913 would become the main street of the city, before developing and adopting a new city plan in 1889. This included a new sewer system, new planning regulations including limits to the width of streets and height of buildings, the building of new streets, and prevention of unregulated construction in the city. The plan also included a school and children's hospital, and the construction of the Pushkin Boulevard. Two concrete bridges were built over the river, and the embankment strengthened. Many streets were also renamed as part of this plan. =1899-1917: Private practice in Yalta= Yusupov Palace, Koreiz 1909 Krasnov also ran a private practice in Yalta until 1911. Among his most famous work is the Livadia Palace, later the location of the 1945 Yalta Conference. This was built on the Yalta estate of Tsar Nicholas II, on the site of a previous palace demolished in 1904. Krasnov worked on the designs through 1909 and they were commissioned in 23 April 1910, and built over the subsequent 17 months. Krasnov designed over 60 buildings in Crimea in total, blending a modernist style with the traditions of the local architecture. Other notable examples include the Dulber Palace in Koreiz (built 1895-97), Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Yalta (1902), Yusupov Palace in Koreiz (1909), and Kokkoz Jami Mosque in Sokolyne (1910). In 1913, he presented a collection of illustrations he had produced of his works to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts, where he held the title of academician. =1919-1922: Exile in Malta= An opponent of the Russian Revolution, Krasnov left Yalta with his family in 1919 for Malta, alongside the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna, sister of Queen Alexandra, and over 600 members of the Russian aristocracy. Nikolay was in a group housed in the empty Villa St Ignatius, which had been a Jesuit college and then a hospital during World War I. To earn money, Nikolay painted many scenes of Malta, signing his paintings as N Krasnoff. He is known as Nicholas Krasnoff in Malta. In May 2016 Malta Post issued a commemorative set of stamps in his honour. =1922-1939: Work in Belgrade= Monument to Nikolay Krasnov in Belgrade In 1922 Krasnov and his wife moved to Belgrade, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He was one of around 90,000 Russian emigr√©s in Yugoslavia at the time, and one of many Russian architects and civil engineers that would have a large impact on the country over the next two decades. In Belgrade he became head of the Department of Monumental Architectural Developments and Monuments, part of the Serbian Ministry of Housing and Building. His building designs in Serbia number around 60, and were created under the name Nikola Krasnov, as a mark of respect to his adopted homeland. His key works in Belgrade include: the Ministry of Forestry building (now Ministry of Foreign Affairs) (1923) which bears a memorial plaque to Krasnov; the Serbian National Archive Building (1928); and the Yugoslavian Ministry of Finance Building (built 1926-29).ƒê. Sikimiƒá: The Facade sculpture in Belgrade, Belgrade 1965 These academicist buildings were large and imposing, and designed to represent the strength of Yugoslavian statehood. However, Krasnov also created buildings of various other styles, including the renovation of the medieval Ru≈æica Church in 1925. He also created the artistic interiors for St. George's Church royal mausoleum in Topola, the villa of the Old Palace in Belgrade, and the House of the National Assembly (completed in 1936). He died in Belgrade on 8 December 1939, and is buried in the Russian section of the New Cemetery in Belgrade. In 2016 a street in Belgrade was renamed in his honour.

September 15, 1733) was Governor of Paraguay in 1733. He immediately faced disobedience and rebellion from the comuneros who controlled the countryside, and was killed shortly into his tenure. Biography Ruyloba's early life is not well known. He was maestre de campo of Callao when he was named Governor of Paraguay, a province in turmoil due to the Revolt of the Comuneros. Ruyloba was not the Viceroy's pick for Governor, but rather the Crown in Spain; it is possible that the Continental Spaniards did not have a good sense of how deeply the problems in Paraguay ran and what kind of politician would be needed to quell them. Ruyloba was offered a force of 300 soldiers to take with him by Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, governor of the neighboring R√≠o de la Plata, but he eschewed it, believing the promises the Paraguayans sent of their loyalty to the King and not wishing to antagonize the situation prematurely.Lopez, p. 135-139. Ruyloba entered Asunci√≥n on July 27, 1733, and was recognized as Governor. Ruyloba's service as governor was extremely short, however, as he proceeded to dramatically overplay his position. He declared in a speech that the establishment of the Junta Gobernativa had been treason, and that anyone attempting to revive it would be publicly executed. After three weeks of assessing the situation, Ruyloba began to dispense the justice that the Viceroy had ordered on the rebels. All elections to the cabildo since 1730 were declared invalid, and the cabildo and leadership of the militia was purged. Ruyloba also began preparations for the return of the hated Jesuits to their college in Asunci√≥n. This antagonized what thin support Ruyloba had, and the comuneros began to rally in the countryside again, with Ruyloba largely oblivious to their actions due to having few allies in Paraguay so soon into his tenure. When Ruyloba learnt about the comunero army, he attempted to rally the Asunci√≥n militia to ride and meet it, but found his own army deserting him en masse, unwilling to fight the comuneros for a governor who supported the Jesuits and had just arrested many of the leaders of the militia. Ruyloba met with the comunero leaders in a meeting orchestrated by neutral party Bishop Arregui, known to be sympathetic to both sides. Ruyloba was advised to agree to at least some concessions, but he flatly refused. He also declined to leave the province. For honor's sake, Ruyloba took to the battlefield afterward practically alone, since the militia had deserted him. He was killed in a brief battle with the rebels in Guajaibity (near Itaugu√°), September 15, 1733. After Ruyloba's death, he was succeeded as governor by Bishop Arregui. Arregui was a facade of legitimacy for the comuneros, though, and wielded little power.Lopez, p. 146-150. References La historia del Paraguay, Tomo I * F. Rivas, La Antigua Provincia del Paraguay.

On 3 February 2015 Cognitive Technologies jointly with Kamaz (Russian Dakar-winning leading car manufacturer) announced the start of the self-driving truck project, with the goal to start manufacturing self-driving Kamaz trucks in 2020. In June 2015 the prototype successfully passed the first field tests. The system developed by Cognitive Technologies does not require building smart cities and smart roads equipped with multiple sensors ‚Äì it works the opposite way, trying to understand the situation on the road like humans do. The system uses a video camera like a driver who uses his eyes, analyzing the information and focusing on the relevant data. For this purpose the system uses a special type of computer vision ‚Äì foveal computer vision. Only 5‚Äì7% of the data gathered by the video cameras and sensors is processed by the system as relevant. The prototype is being tested in Russia on rough roads, on roads without marking, with the goal to prepare the system for work in difficult situations and on bad roads all around the world.Pilotless transportation literally takes off in Russia, RBTH, 23 May 2016  C-Pilot ADAS project  In August 2016 Cognitive Technologies started its own ADAS development project C-Pilot for ground transport control automation.–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç—å 3‚Äì5% —Ä—ã–Ω–∫–∞ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º –∞–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫ 2022 –≥–æ–¥—É, TASS, 23 August 2016–í –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç –¥–ª—è –∞–≤—Ç–æ, Life.ru, 23 August 2016Can Russians save Tesla?, RBTH, 26 August 2016The Russian company introduced the self-driving car system C-Pilot for any car, ActualApple, 23 August 2016 The project has three stages: * By 2017, the company will develop a number of features for warning the driver in cases of road situations requiring increased attention: lane departure warning system, traffic sign recognition system, forward collision warning system, blind spot detection system, pedestrian protection system * By 2018 a system of active driver assistance will be developed, capable of interfering with the vehicle's systems (automatic steering, automatic braking, maintaining a safe distance with the vehicle ahead within the lane). Nevertheless, such system would require direct control of the road situation by the driver. * In 2019‚Äì2022 the developers plan to finalize the technological components to enable autonomous movement in certain modes (traffic jams or motorways). The final stage of the project will be to ensure the possibility of fully autonomous driving. Within the consortium Cognitive Technologies is the initiator of forming of an international working group to develop a single software standard for the self-driving vehicle control.  Self-driving tractors and harvesters project  In January 2016 Cognitive Technologies and Innopolis city (Tatarstan region) announced the start of the ‚ÄúSmart Farming‚Äù joint initiative within the Agropolis project. Cognitive Technologies team will develop AI technologies for self-driving harvesters and tractors together with the leading Russian farming equipment manufacturer ‚Äì Rostselmash and the agricultural enterprise Soyuz Agro. The experts from Cognitive Technologies claim that the system will track stones, poles, and other obstacles that might be dangerous for the vehicles. This data will enable the engineers to develop an interactive field map, with GPS coordinates for stones and other obstacles. Eventually, this will result in an alteration of the harvester's movement pattern preventing it from running into stones or other objects that may inflict damage. Harvesters will work autonomously on the field, on the territory that is narrowed by radio beacons.–í –¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ –∏—Å–ø—ã—Ç—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –±–µ—Å–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä, BBC, 10 June 2016Landmaschine der Zukunft: Unbemannter Traktor im Feldeinsatz, Agrarheute, 20 June 2016  Present international activities  In 2016 Cognitive Technologies has joined the international community OpenPower Foundation, a consortium of open source solutions to developers based on POWER technology from IBM, which includes the world's leading IT map of Google, NVidia, Mellanox, etc.Cognitive Technologies –ø—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É OpenPower Foundation, PCMag Russian EditionEuropean Market Adopting OpenPOWER Technology at Accelerated Pace, YahooEuropean Market Adopting OpenPOWER Technology at Accelerated Pace, Marketwired Within the consortium Cognitive Technologies is the initiator of forming of an international working group to develop a single software standard for the self-driving vehicle control.–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏—è —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±–µ—Å–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞, Isvestia, 14 November 2016  Awards  * In 2016, the leading Russian business newspaper Kommersant, announced that Cognitive Technologies is the TOP-2 Russian software company.–¢–∞–±–ª–∏—Ü–∞ 2.–†–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è, Kommersant, 4 April 2016 * TOP-6 Russian software company in 2015 according to Russoft¬´–†–£–°–°–û–§–¢¬ª —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞ —Ä–µ–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–µ–π—à–∏—Ö —Å–æ—Ñ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, PCweek, 23 September 2015 * TOP-500 biggest Russian companies according to RBC–†–µ–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–µ–π—à–∏—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ –≤—ã—Ä—É—á–∫–µ, RBC * TOP-2 company of the Russian EDMS market in 2014 according to IDCIDC –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∏–ª–∞ —Ä—ã–Ω–æ–∫ –°–≠–î, CRN, 1 December 2014 * TOP-20 Russian biggest IT-companies in 2013 according to Cnews Analytics–†–µ–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–µ–π—à–∏—Ö —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö IT-–∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏–π, CRN  References  External links * Software companies of Russia Companies based in Moscow Optical character recognition ","title":"Cognitive Technologies"},{"id":"52504296","text":"James Barry Christopher Nugent (1698‚Äì1775) was an Irish physician in London. He was a founder member of The Club, Samuel Johnson's dining circle. Life Nugent was born in Ireland and, after graduating M.D. in France, went into practice. He worked first in the south of Ireland, and then at Bath, where he had success. Early in 1764 Nugent moved to London. He lived first in Queen Anne Street, and later in Suffolk Street, off The Strand. On 25 June 1765 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and in the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Nugent died on 12 October 1775. It has been argued that the writer Thomas Nugent was his brother. Works In 1753 Nugent published in London An Essay on the Hydrophobia. The book begins with an account of a successful treatment by him in June 1751 of a servant-maid who had been bitten by a mad turnspit dog in two places, and had rabies. He treated her mainly by powders of musk and cinnabar. Later sections discuss the mental and physical aspects of the disease, its resemblances to hysteria, and some proposed remedies. Family Nugent married a Miss Leake, and they had a son and daughter. The wife was a Presbyterian; he himself a Catholic. Edmund Burke was his patient around 1750; and married his daughter Jane Mary, brought up a Catholic, early in 1757. Burke called his younger son Christopher, after his father-in-law. The son, John Nugent (1737‚Äì1813), left six sons and two daughters. His first wife was Elizabeth Hargrave, who died in 1779, the widow of Major Richard Hargrave. Hargrave was the brother of Christopher Hargrave (c.1710‚Äì1787), a chancery solicitor, and so uncle of Francis Hargrave the legal writer. Nugent spent some time in America. He married again, his second wife Lucy (1762‚Äì1826) being the daughter of Garrett Nagle of Ballyduff. They were married on 12 May 1786 in Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cork, Ireland. A Barbados estate, Boarded Hall, arising as a legacy from Sir Edmund Nagle who died in 1830, came partially under the control of John Nugent's eldest son Christopher Richard Nugent. The other main executor was Garrett Nagle of Ballynamona, County Cork, representing another branch of the Nagles. Edmund Nagle (died young in 1763) the father of Sir Edmund Nagle, Garrett Nagle of Ballyduff and Elizabeth Nagle who married in 1754 Garrett Nagle of Ballinamona, were three children of Patrick Nagle and his wife Ellen O'Donovan. Sir Edmund left a wife and a sister, both called Mary. The two executors were descendants respectively of Garrett Nagle of Ballyduff, and of Garrett Nagle of Ballinamona, not closely related by blood as a grandson of Garrett Nagle of Clogher. The senior of the Ballynamona side at the time was presumably Garrett Nagle (born 1776). Christopher Richard Nugent married in 1818 Catherine Elizabeth Nash, daughter of the merchant Thomas Nash. He sailed to Valparaiso in 1823, appointed by George Canning in 1823 the first consul-general to Chile, with Henry William Rouse and Matthew Carter. His brother Thomas died unmarried.Charles W. Centner, The Chilean Failure to Obtain British Recognition, 1823‚Äì1828, Revista de Historia de Am√©rica No. 15 (Dec. 1942), pp. 285‚Äì297. Published by: Pan American Institute of Geography and History. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20136471 Of six daughters: *Jane married Richard Barnewall *Catherine married St. Leger Hill, an army officer *Mary married Isaac Wood, Archdeacon of Chester *Margaret married James Hill, son of James Hill of Graig, Co. Cork. *Elizabeth and Lucy were unmarried. The Hills were relations of the Nagles, Arundel Hill (1739‚Äì1820) having married Helen, daughter of Garrett Nagle of Fountainville and Ballyduff, in 1777 as his second wife. James Hill of Graig, and St. Leger Hill, were respectively the third and fourth sons of Arundel Hill. After Margaret died, James Hill remarried to Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Dean Oliver. Associations Nugent was one of the nine original members of Dr. Johnson's literary club. He was regular in his attendance, and was present when James Boswell was admitted. In the imaginary college at St. Andrews, discussed with Johnson, he was to be professor of physic. As a Catholic, he had an omelette on Friday at the club dinner; one club day after Nugent's death Johnson exclaimed, \\"Ah! my poor friend, I shall never eat omelette with thee again.\\" Benjamin Hoadley was one of his medical friends.

It is the first in her series of Hercule Poirot novels, after being authorised by the estate of Agatha Christie to write new stories for the character. The next two are Closed Casket (2016) and The Mystery of Three Quarters (2018). Plot summary Poirot is taking a holiday from private-detective work, though in fact he has only travelled to the guest house nearest his London flat; he can even see the flat from the house's parlour window. One evening, while waiting for his dinner in a coffee house he frequents, he is confronted by a distressed young woman who tells him that she is \\"already dead... or will be soon\\", but that he absolutely must not pursue her killer. \\"The crime must never be solved\\", she pleads. The next day brings news that three seemingly unconnected people have been murdered in their rooms at the Bloxham Hotel, each with a cuff-link placed carefully in their mouths, and engraved with the initials \\"PIJ\\". Furthermore, the staff are alerted to the murders and room numbers by a note left at the front desk, reading \\"MAY THEY NEVER REST IN PEACE. 121. 238. 317.\\" Poirot, enlisted by investigating Scotland Yard officer Edward Catchpool, whom he meets staying at the same guest house, takes the case, and gradually uncovers a complex web of bigotry, hate, and vengeance. Characters *Hercule Poirot *Edward Catchpool Reviews Continuity with Christie's original stories The novel is set in 1929, placing it shortly after The Mystery of the Blue Train, published 1928, and roughly three years before Peril at End House, published 1932. It is therefore set in a relatively early stage of Poirot's long career after he settled in England as a refugee from the Great War, following a distinguished career in his native Belgium. Poirot's occasional sidekick and chronicler Arthur Hastings is absent from this novel; here, his shoes are filled by thirty-two-year-old Scotland Yard policeman Edward Catchpool, who, like Hastings, serves as the first-person narrator. Hannah has stated that she wanted to avoid reusing any of Christie's supporting cast. Commissioning by Agatha Christie estate The Monogram Murders is the first original novel including Hercule Poirot to be commissioned by the Christie estate, more than thirty-eight years after her death in 1976. It is the thirty-fourth novel to feature the character. Agatha Christie wrote her last Poirot novel, Elephants Can Remember, in 1972. The last featuring Poirot and written by Christie was Curtain: Poirot's Last Case, published 1975 but written in the 1940s to be a swansong.

He is a professor of Cognitive Neuroscience and the head of the Cognition, Learning, and Plasticity Group at the University of Oxford and a senior fellow in Psychology at Jesus College.  Biography  Roi was born in Israel in 1976. He became interested in psychology at age 14, following his mother's illness and early death. After absolving mandatory service in the Israel Defence Forces, he started his studies at Achva College, and received his undergraduate degree in Behavioral Science from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 2002. Based on his achievements in his undergraduate studies, he received the prestigious Kreitman Foundation Doctoral Fellowship and was accepted to the direct track in PhD in neuropsychology with Prof. Avishai Henik. During his PhD degree (summa cum laude), he completed the European Diploma in Cognitive and Brain Sciences (EDCBS), and received training as an intern in clinical neuropsychology, at Beit Leowenstein Rehabilitation Center. He then decided to follow a research career, and received a Rothschild post- doctoral fellowship and funding from European Commission and the International Brain Research Organization to join the Institute Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London for his postdoctoral training. In 2009 he received a Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship to move to the University of Oxford where he established his lab.  Research  = Numerical Cognition = Cohen Kadosh started to work on numerical cognition under the supervision of Avishai Henik. Cohen Kadosh's work has focused on how humans represent numbers and the psychological and biological mechanisms that support superior, typical, and impaired numerical understanding, a research with implications for a wide range of fields including psychology, education, and neuroscience. His work in this field has led to significant changes in several dominant theories of numerical cognition. = Synesthesia = Cohen Kadosh has revealed some of the cognitive and perceptual principles of synesthesia and its neurobiological mechanisms, which has implications for the field of neuroplasticity and learning. He has also suggested that the origins of synesthesia might be due to a failure in cortical specialization during infancy and childhood. = Cognitive Enhancement = Cohen Kadosh has been one of the pioneers in combining cognitive training with non-invasive brain stimulation to show its impact on cognition, learning, and brain functions. In the last years he has extended his work to examine the role of individual differences at the psychological and biological level on the impact of brain stimulation on behaviour, those allowing a better mechanistic understanding of brain stimulation and learning. = Neuroethics = Cohen Kadosh has collaborated with neuroethicists to highlight the implications of brain stimulation for cognitive enhancement and shape the current regulation.  Select awards and honours  * In 2009 he received The Sieratzki-Korczyn Prize for Advances in the Neurosciences. * In 2014, the British Psychological Society announced that he would be the recipient of the Spearman Medal. * In 2015, his book,The Stimulated Brain, was given an Honorable Mention for Biomedicine & Neuroscience at the 2015 PROSE Awards from the Association of American Publishers.

It is located at the junction of Dera Ismail Khan and Lakki Marwat districts, approximately 25 kilometers towards east on Indus Highway at the town of Pezu. Access to the hill station is difficult due to the poor condition of the unpaved road which is regularly degraded by rainfall during the monsoon period. It has a lot of old monuments.Badin: The road less travelled Retrieved December 9, 2016  History  The Post Office Resort in 2015 The name Sheikh Badin originates from name of the sufi saint Sheikh Baha-u-Din Shah, locally famous as Jand≈ç Nek≈ç who is buried at the main cemetery of the village. Traditional folklore describes the famous sufi saint Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gillani came to spend 40 days in recluse at the hill. Jand≈ç Nek≈ç was a descendant of Sufi Saint Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gillani, and came to live here circa 1600 AD in commemoration of his ancestor's recluse on the hill. An annual religious fair, the \\"Sadra\\", is held by the devotees of the Syed Tribe in the moth of April. Devotees from the nearby districts climb the hill and present gifts to the locals and make recitations and prayers on the graves of the ancient Syeds buried in the village.  Climate and Population  Tourist huts at Sheikh Badin The hill station is at an average altitude of 1300 meters from sea level. Due to the significant elevation, the climate is less severe compared to surrounding areas and summers are relatively pleasant while winters are harsh and dry. Occasional snowfall is recorded in the months of January and February. The composition of the mountain is mainly rock and minerals which holds little to no water reserves. The village is sustained by rainwater gathered in 7-8 pools, out of which are not always intact and need regular repairs. The population is composed of roughly 50 households, main tribes being Syeds and Sahibs. The main source of income for the villagers is livestock and business. Recently, with the interest of the provincial and federal governments, there has been some efforts to promote tourism and the hill station has been declared a national park to preserve the natural flora and fauna and historical artifacts. Around 10 tourist huts have been constructed at the main village site and electricity provided to the village, although the service is not reliable and power outages are long and unpredictable. Roads are unpaved and mostly dilapidated due to annual rainfall and lack maintenance.  Monuments  The Christian Cemetery at Sheikh Badin Most notable of the historical artifacts is the zyarat of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Gillani's recluse at the top of the highest hill in the village. For its milder climate, the hill station was used as a summer station by the British era civil servants and has many artifacts from the British era. These include the ruins of Imperial British administrative offices, a police station and a British cemetery which are partially intact. Other British era artifacts are a tennis court, a squash court, a storage pit and some officer residential houses. A Post Office Resort or Bungalow was constructed in the 1970s with panoramic views of the surrounding plains and villages of Lakki Marwat, but it has degraded to rubble due to lack of maintenance over the past few decades and is no longer functional.

Designed and programmed by company co-founder Sid Meier, it is one of the few 2D action games he created and the only platform game. It allows up to four players at once. The 1982 release is written in Atari BASIC. A second version, published in 1983, is programmed in assembly language for improved performance, and the computer controls any unused players. Version 2 was available for both the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64. Gameplay The player can make Floyd run left and right with the joystick, jump by pressing the joystick button, and punch by keeping the button held after landing from a jump. Some actions in the game give points: collecting a bird (1 point), punching a pygmy (2 points), and reaching \\"Janice\\" at the top of the screen (4 points). In a multiplayer game, the first player to reach a predetermined point value wins. Single-player games have a time limit instead. Other hazards can hurt Floyd, sending him to the bottom of the screen. Development When asked in 1983 where the Floyd of the Jungle concept came from, Meier responded: Reception The game was reviewed in Computer Gaming World, which stated that \\"In view of the many superbly-crafted games of this genre on the market today, FJ finds itself up against some pretty outstanding company. In my opinion, he comes up short. However, FJ is less expensive than much of its competition, and may therefore be an acceptable choice for some gamers.\\" In a 1984 review of the game's second release, Creative Computing concluded: \\"If you are really into the Donkey Kong type of games, and want every variation for your library, then you will want Floyd of the Jungle. But we think that there are others on the market that offer better playability and more fun.\\" In a brief review of the C64 version for Electronic Games, Ted Salamone wrote, \\"it doesn't have any great moments. It doesn't even have any good ones!\\" He called out the visuals as \\"so substandard that they are an insult, display an incredible lack of detail and imagination,\\" and also that \\"poorly executed collision detection routines result in many an untimely death.\\" References External links Floyd of the Jungle can be played for free at the Internet Archive: *Original Atari BASIC version *C64 version 2 1982 video games Atari 8-bit family games Commodore 64 games Platform games Sid Meier games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Floyd of the Jungle"},{"id":"52504550","text":"Ian Coulson (born 5 April 1980) is a Zimbabwean cricketer.

Barrow drew her ideas together in her book simply titled Lawrence Alma-Tadema (2001) in which she sought to rehabilitate Alma-Tadema's reputation which had been neglected for most of the twentieth century by arguing that he frequently used literary and archaeological allusions in his work to make subversive comments about apparently innocent subjects.Lawrence Alma-Tadema.

He is only known through the joint coins with his father Strato II. He may have been supplanted, in conjunction with his father or later as an independent king, by the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps, particularly Rajuvula and Bhadayasa, whose coins were often copied on those of the last Indo-Greek kings.The Dynastic Arts of the Kushans, John M. Rosenfield, University of California Press, 1967, p.135 R.C. Senior, Indo- Scythian coins and history. Volume IV. The Greek legend clearly implies that the two kings were father and son, and Senior dismisses the older reading \\"grandson\\" on the Kharosthi legend. Coinage Strato III may also have issued coins on his own, but these are rare and unconfirmed.Coin India gallery Coin India Strato II and III A few silver coins with a different portrait and the inscription Strato Soter Dikaios (\\"the just\\") may also belong to Strato III as sole ruler, or to a fourth king named Strato.Senior, ibid. Just like the earlier king Strato I, Strato III is thought to belong to the dynasty of Menander I, who also used the epithet Soter and the symbol of standing Pallas Athena. The chronology of the late Indo-Greek kingdom has been established by Bopearachchi and other scholars from numismatical evidence alone. The coins deteriorated continuously, the Strato coins being the most debased and crude in style, a striking contrast to earlier kings who struck some of the most beautiful coins of antiquity. The decay was due to the increasing pressure of the Indo-Scythian nomads on the remaining Greek pockets, as well as their long isolation from the rest of the Hellenistic world. Strato II, Strato III and Strato Dikaios struck debased silver drachms, which as mentioned portray Pallas on the reverse. Strato II appears as an old man with a sunken jaw on some of his coins, which is not surprising given that his grandson was co- regent. Strato II also issued bronzes and even lead coins of the common type Apollo/tripod. On some of Strato II's silver drachms the letter sigma is written as C, a not uncommon trait on late Hellenistic coins in the east. Imitations by Indo-Scythian rulers Coin of Northern Satrap Rajuvula (c. 10 CE), an imitation of Strato II, Mathura. Subsequent Indo-Scythian rulers, who replaced the Stratos in their territories, designed their coins in direct imitation of those of Strato II and Strato III. This is the case of the Northern Satraps, who ruled in the territories from Sagala in Eastern Punjab to Mathura, such as Rajuvula. Just as the Yuezhi had copied the coins of the last Greco-Bactrian ruler Heliocles in Bactria, or the Indo-Scythians had copied the coins of the last western Indo-Greek ruler Hermaios in the area of Kabul, here again the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps relied heavily on the numismatics of their predecessors.

All 47 people on board died, including singer-turned-preacher and entrepreneur Junaid Jamshed, and the Deputy Commissioner of the District of Chitral.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an ATR 42-500, serial number 663, registration AP-BHO, delivered to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) in 2007. In 2009, the aircraft was damaged during a landing attempt at Lahore, but was subsequently repaired and returned to service. It sustained an engine failure in 2014, but the engine was replaced and no further problems were reported. By the time of the crash, it had recorded more than 18,700 flight hours since joining PIA's fleet and had last undergone certification in October 2016. Crash The aircraft left Chitral Airport at 15:30 PST and was expected to land at Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Islamabad at around 16:40. Before the crash, the crew issued a mayday call. The aircraft crashed at about 16:15, leaving wreckage ablaze on the side of a hill between the villages of Saddha Batolni and Gug, near the Pakistan Ordnance Factory in Havelian in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province about from the airport. The wreckage was reported to be strewn over an area about across. According to an eyewitness, Mohammad Haroon, the aircraft flew at a very low altitude and made a high-pitched noise, flying in an erratic, up-and-down mode before crashing into the hillside. \\"There was a huge bang after the plane hit the mountainside and caught fire\\". Announcements were broadcast by local mosques to mobilise villagers, who rushed to the site to look for survivors but were unable to get close due to the heat of the fire. Pakistan Army personnel and helicopters were also sent to the area for search and rescue operations. Taj Muhammad Khan, a government official, stated that all the bodies were burned beyond recognition. The remains were taken by air to forensic laboratories in Islamabad and Rawalpindi for DNA testing to aid identification. This was the seventh aircraft accident resulting in hull loss sustained by PIA since 2000. Of the previous six, one resulted in fatalities; that of PIA Flight 688 in 2006, in which 45 people died.

Forty-four were Pakistani citizens; and the others were two Austrians and one Chinese. The dead included Pakistani singer-turned-preacher Junaid Jamshed who was traveling with his wife. a member of Chitral's traditional royal family, his wife and family. Two sky marshals and one Aircraft Maintenance Engineer were also among the passengers. The captain was reported to be an experienced pilot with over 12,000 flight hours during his career. He was also a type-rated instructor for ATR aircraft. Investigation Investigators retrieved the aircraft's flight recorder soon after the crash. An initial report into the accident by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) was said to have determined that the aircraft's left engine malfunctioned at an altitude of . The pilot reported the engine failure at 16:12, which was followed by a rapid uncontrolled descent and the disappearance of the aircraft from ground radar a few minutes later. However, the radio communication continued with radar even after disappearance from the screen of the radar. Following an incident involving an ATR 72 at Multan Airport on 11 December, the PCAA ordered all ATR aircraft belonging to PIA to be grounded for inspection. Five ATR 42 and five ATR 72 aircraft were affected by the order. Early reports speculated that the failed engine exploded and compromised the airframe, leading to the crash, but they have not been substantiated. Analysis of the flight recorder data was continuing as of January 2017, with the reasons that the aircraft was not able to safely land on the functioning engine still unknown. A one-page preliminary report of the Safety Investigation Board found a 'lapse' on the part of the PIA and a 'lack of oversight' by the PCAA.  Criticism of PIA  Following the crash, PIA received criticism of its practices and accusations that it did not investigate aircraft defects thoroughly enough. The mother of the ATR 42's first officer reported that he frequently mentioned to her that PIA's aircraft \\"are not fit to fly, and they should not be allowed to operate on dangerous routes\\". Two days after the crash, another PIA pilot reportedly refused to fly an aircraft with a faulty engine. This was after several reports that PIA had a history of neglecting problems and of operating poorly overall as an airline. PIA responded that \\"it defies common sense that pilots and engineers would fly an aircraft that does not meet safety standards and risk their own lives.\\" The chairman of PIA, Azam Saigol, resigned six days after the crash citing personal reasons, though there were reports of him being pressured to resign.

His stay in the US had enabled him to acquire donors who offered to initiate projects in his constituency, and that in a way helped sway voters to his side. He found it easy to reach out to the poor in his constituency because he was seen as one of them. Jacob Oboth-Oboth was first elected as West Budama South MP (Independent) in 2011 after defeating the then State Minister for Labor, Dr Emmanuel Otaala, who subsequently but unsuccessfully challenged his victory in the Courts of law. He retained his seat in 2016 after polling 20,653 votes against the NRM candidate, Phibby Awere Otaala‚Äôs 19, 462 votes. Oboth-Oboth set the record for being the first legislator to be elected for a second successive term in this constituency which had not re-elected an incumbent MP to Parliament since 1996. In the 9th Parliament, Oboth-Oboth was the chairperson of the Committee on Rules, Discipline and Privileges and the parliamentary ad hoc committee to investigate the electricity sub sector; the Committee on Natural Resources. In the 10th Parliament, he is the chairperson of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee and a member of the Committee on Rules, Discipline and Privileges and the Business Committee.

It was originally constructed for the London and North Eastern Railway, opening in October 1923.  History  The rail line passing through the depot was opened to goods and passengers in 1905, as part of the Ponteland branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The branch consisted of a single-track, running from South Gosforth to Ponteland and Darras Hall. The line closed to passengers in June 1929, but was re-opened as part of the Tyne and Wear Metro, as far as Bank Foot in May 1981, with a further extension to Newcastle Airport in November 1991. In 1918, a fire at Heaton car sheds, which destroyed the building, as well as 34 cars, led to a replacement depot being required. The site of the depot was acquired by the North Eastern Railway in 1921, with the replacement depot at Gosforth opening in October 1923. At the time, there was 10 lines in the depot building, with a further two serving the repair shop. Originally, the depot was used to house the former Tyneside Electrics rolling stock. Prior to the opening of the Tyne and Wear Metro in the early 1980s, Class 101, 104 and 105 DMUs were a common sight at the depot. These vehicles were used on the North Tyneside Loop, as well as services running to and from Newcastle and South Shields.  Tyne and Wear Metro  Since 1980, the depot has been operated by the Tyne and Wear Metro, and now houses a fleet of 89 Metrocars. It is used for stabling, cleaning, maintenance and repair of the fleet. It is located between stations at Longbenton, South Gosforth and Regent Centre, and can be accessed by trains from either east or west. There is also a depot-avoiding line running from east to west, which is not used in public service. Prior to the arrival of new rolling stock towards the end of 2021, a new depot is currently being constructed near Howdon, in North Tyneside. The site will be used as a temporary stabling and maintenance facility for up to 10 Metrocars, whilst the current depot at South Gosforth is re-built. The temporary depot at Howdon is expected to open during summer 2020.

The film is a sequel to 2016's Lazer Team, and follows the team travelling through a wormhole to find their missing friend Woody. It was released on YouTube Red in November 2017. It received positive reviews, critics stating it as an improvement from its predecessor. Plot Four years after the events of the previous film, the D.E.T.I.A. has mostly lost its funding and nearly everyone has been let go. Lazer Team has also been disbanded, as the four heroes do not work well together, Woody (Gavin Free) being the only member to be reassigned. He, along with Dr. Maggie Whittington (Nichole Bloom), has been attempting to create a rift in space, after receiving an unknown transmission. Once the rift is perfected, Woody is taken by an alien being, his helmet remaining behind. After an attempted rescue ends in a failure, Major Evelyn Kilbourne (Victoria Pratt) is now head of the D.E.T.I.A., and declares that any project associated with Lazer Team is to be shut down. This announcement angers Maggie, who is determined to not leave Woody lost forever. When her lab is getting cleaned out, Maggie steals a device called the translocator and sets out to find the remaining members of Lazer Team. With the team split, Herman (Colton Dunn) has capitalized on his fame in the form of marketing and commercialism; Zach (Michael Jones) owns and operates a 'lazer' hair removal business in an attempt to win back his ex-girlfriend, Mindy (Allie DeBerry); Hagan (Burnie Burns) suffers from depression, as he feels his life has peaked, and he actually wants the team to form again. Maggie is able to gather the three at Hagan's house and explains the situation. While Hagan readily agrees, Herman and Zach are less than excited. The team sneaks into the base, where they're able to temporarily re-open the rift. However, Kilbourne intervenes and fights them. They all make it into the portal before it closes and Kilbourne is knocked unconscious. The four find that they're on an alien spacecraft, somewhere deep in space. Maggie also realizes that because too many people went through the rift, the translocator is out of power. Not wasting any time, they crawl through vents to avoid detection. Maggie is immediately taken by the creature that abducted Woody, and the rest of the team escape the other way. Upon exiting the vents, the three are captured and imprisoned by cloaked figures. They reveal themselves to be the Antareans. Their leader, Arklosh, still holds a grudge over Lazer Team's previous victory, so the aliens remove the Champion Armor pieces from them and, along with Woody's helmet, they disintegrate it. The Antareans transfer them to a white prison, that is one of infinite cells containing previous champions from over the years. Before they can panic, Woody arrives and rescues them. Without his helmet, it appears that his intelligence has decreased. He takes them to a compartment in the ship, where Maggie is held. She wakes, but is upset that Woody is not the one she's known. The creature that had abducted the two reveals himself. Woody introduces him as Doulos, the keeper of the 'Galactic Games' and the only remaining of the Ludon species, who has been enslaved on the ship for many years. He explains that when the team defeated the Antareans, it caused said aliens to wipe out planet after planet, afraid that more champions would rise and rebel against them. Revealing that he brought the team back together to finish what they've started, he leads the five to a control center where an experimental upgraded suit of power resides. The team is unwilling and Doulos urges the team to put on the pieces, however he is killed by Kilbourne before he can convince them. She reveals that she is the sister of the previous champion, Adam, and is now working with the Antareans, as she's always been jealous. Once the team is in a holding cell, she prepares to receive the pieces to destroy Earth. When the ship finally arrives to Earth, the team realize their wrongdoings with not helping Doulos. They kill two guards before sneaking back to the control center. A battle ensues and Lazer Team acquires the upgraded armor. Back on Earth, Officer Vandenbloom (Kirk Johnson) notices many Antarean ships heading for the planet. With the help of Mindy and 'Mr. Scientist' (Gus Sorola), he is able to fend off the majority of the ships using a turret designed by the D.E.T.I.A. Back on the ship, the five are able to kill Kilbourne, with the help of another champion Woody had let out, and grab the translocator. They board a small ship, and using the device, are able to destroy the Antarean mother-ship and return home. With the Earth saved once again, the team keeps contact with one another. Having a picnic, Woody and Maggie reveal their feelings for each other. They discover a small button on his helmet that shrinks it, and the two kiss.

He made his first-team debut, which was to be his only Football League appearance, on 5 March 1904 away to Small Heath in the First Division. In a reshuffled half-back line, William Fullarton replaced Alex Barrie at centre half while Bertram stood in for Dicky Jackson at left half, and Sunderland lost 2‚Äì1.

It is found in wild isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans. The species replicates in the intestines of C. elegans. After adhering to the intestinal wall the fungus begins its two stage life cycle before leaving the host.  Infection  N. parisii is an intracellular parasite that is exclusively transmitted horizontally from one animal to another most commonly through the mouth or the feces.Once N. parisii gets into the intestines it forms small ovoid microbes that cause the intestinal wall to be more textured. The small microbes then become spores and leave holes in the intestinal wall.The microsporidian spores are likely to exit the cells by disrupting a conserved cytoskeletal structure in the intestine called the terminal web. It seems that none of the known immune pathways of C. elegans is involved in mediating resistance against N. parisii. Microsporidia were found in several nematodes isolated from different locations, indicating that microsporidia are common natural parasites of C. elegans.  Anatomy  There are two life stages of N. parisii which include the spore stage and the meront stage.The spores have a bulky cell wall to help them be able to live outside of the host cell during transmission.The spores include a polar tube that aids in the infection of the host cell.The tube helps the sporoplasm get into the host cell by turning itself inside out in order to get the sporoplasm close enough to the host cell to infect it.The sporoplasm becomes the merit which then becomes more spores after infection within the host cell.Once the spores have reached their mature stage they can can be let go for transmission to infect another host.Since the genome size is small and there are very few metabolic pathways N. parisii needs its host to survive.  New Species  The N. parisii‚ÄìC. elegans system represents a very useful tool to study infection mechanisms of intracellular parasites.Troemel ER, F√©lix M, Whiteman NK, Barri√®re N, Ausubel FM (2008) Microsporidia are natural intracellular parasites of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. PLoS Biol 6(12): e309. Additionally, a new species of microsporidia was recently found in a wild caught C. elegans that genome sequencing places in the same genus Nematocida as prior microsporidia seen in these nematodes. This new species was named Nematocida displodere, after a phenotype seen in late infected worms that explode at the vulva to release infectious spores. N. displodere was shown to infect a broad range of tissues and cell types in C. elegans, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, seam cells, and coelomocytes. Strangely, the majority of intestinal infection fails to grow to later parasite stages, while the muscle and epidermal infection thrives. This is in stark contrast to N. parisii which infects and completes its entire life cycle in the C. elegans intestine. These related Nematocida species are being used to study the host and pathogen mechanisms responsible for allowing or blocking eukaryotic parasite growth in different tissue niches.

At its southern terminus near the Sydney Observatory, the cycleway is located adjacent to the Western Distributor and connects with the Kent Street cycleway. The northern terminus of the cycleway is at Burton Street, , just below Milsons Point railway station. From this location riders ascend 55 stairs in order to access the path that is located on the roadway level, some above the water level. A campaign to eliminate the steps on this popular cycling route to the CBD has been running since at least 2008.HarbourLink ‚Äì North Sydney Council The absence of an efficient or safe cycleway or cycle paths to access the Bridge has resulted in the HarbourLink proposal to give better access to the Sydney Harbour Bridge's northern approach. The NSW Bike Plan 2010 identified to the Harbour Bridge as one of 13 \\"major missing links\\" and a \\"priority metropolitan link\\". On 7 December 2016 the NSW Roads Minister Duncan Gay confirmed that the northern stairway would be replaced with a 20 million ramp alleviating the needs for cyclists to dismount. At the same time the NSW Government announced plans to upgrade the southern ramp at a projected cost of 15 million. Both projects are expected to completed by late 2020. At the northern terminus there is a long-term plan to link the Sydney Harbour Bridge cycleway with the Gore Hill and Epping Road cycleways, to the northwest. Cycleway use In the 12 months to February 2014 between 2,000 and 3,000 cyclists used the Sydney Harbour Bridge cycleway on an average weekday. The NSW Roads Regulations states that a person must not ride a bicycle on any part of the Sydney Harbour Bridge other than a cycleway.

In 1591, she was appointed head lady in waiting to princess Anna and her spouse to chamberlain of Anna's court. They accompanied Anna to Poland when she left to join her brother Sigismund III Vasa in 1592. Princess Anna returned to Sweden with her court the following year and settled with her court at Stegeborg Castle. In 1595, Anna arranged the scandalous Wednesday Wedding between Margareta's sister Sigrid Brahe and Johan Nilsson Gyllenstierna. Princess Anna and her uncle Duke Charles were involved in several conflicts. The Sparre Affair was to be the final break between Anna and Duke Charles, and it involved also Margareta Brahe and her family. Her brother-in-law Count Erik Larsson Sparre was a staunch supporter of Sigismund, and Anna kept a box for his wife, Margareta's sister Ebba Sparre at Stegeborg, which Duke Charles suspected to contain suspicious documents.Anna, urn:sbl:18719, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av H.

Ebba Sparre's box and the correspondence between Anna and the Sparre couple was confiscated, and he subjected Ebba Sparre as well as Margareta Brahe to an interrogation regarding the encoded information he found in Anna's papers. He accused Ebba Sparre of having smuggled in their brother, Anna's alleged lover Gustav Brahe to her.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Vasadrottningen: en biografi √∂ver Katarina Stenbock 1535‚Äì1621, Historiska media, Lund, 2015 After the Battle of St√•ngebro during the War against Sigismund in 1598, Princess Anna fled with Sigismund to Poland, while Margareta remained; her spouse having been given command of Kalmar by Sigismund. In May 1599, her spouse and her brother-in-law were executed as followers of Sigismund by Charles IX of Sweden during the Kalmar Bloodbath. Margareta fled to Sigismund and Anna in Poland, where she accused her brothers Erik Brahe (1552‚Äì1614) and Magnus Brahe (1564‚Äì1633) of complicity in the death verdict of her spouse. She was provided with a pension by Sigismund for her loyalty and settled with her children in Denmark. In 1628, she was given permission to return to Sweden, where she died ten years later.

It protects a mountainous area of Atlantic Forest. The park contains more than half of Brazil's remaining population of endangered southern muriqui, the largest primate in the Americas other than man. Location Paranapiacaba ecological continuum The Carlos Botelho State Park has its headquarter is S√£o Miguel Arcanjo, S√£o Paulo. It has an area of . The surrounding land includes private landholdings and three private natural heritage reserves, Zizo Park, Rio Taquaral Park and On√ßa Parda (Cougar) Park. The regional economy is based on agriculture, particularly banana farming in the south, and ecotourism. The park's headquarters is in the Planalto region of the Upper Paranapanema River basin, in the municipalities of S√£o Miguel Arcanjo and Cap√£o Bonito. The Sete Barras center is in the Vale do Ribeira region, in the basin of the Ribeira de Iguape River, in the municipality of Sete Barras. History The area occupied by the park was divided into four forest reserves in 1941, named Carlos Botelho, Cap√£o Bonito, Travess√£o and Sete Barras. The Carlos Botelho State Park was created by state decree 19.499 of 10 September 1982. The objectives are to ensure full protection of fauna, flora and natural beauty, and to support education, recreational and scientific activities. Since its creation the park has attracted many researchers, mainly due to its position between two important river basins, its place in the Paranapiacaba ecological continuum, and the many endemic species it shelters. Land ownership has been fully regularized, and there are no residents in the park. S√£o Paulo state decree 58.148 of 21 June 2012 created the Paranapiacaba Conservation Units Mosaic, consisting of the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park, Intervales State Park, Carlos Botelho State Park, Xitu√© Ecological Station, Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park and the Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area in the municipalities of Eldorado, Sete Barras, Tapira√≠, Juqui√°, Ribeir√£o Grande and Cap√£o Bonito. The purpose was to promote integrated and participatory management of the conservation units, and to seek to guarantee conservation of the areas covered. In November 2015 a section of the SP-139 Nequinho Foga√ßa Highway that passes through the park was inaugurated by state governor Geraldo Alckmin. It had been closed since January 2014 while being upgraded. The road used ecologically friendly paving, and has underpasses and overpasses for the animals. Environment The park covers a steep and mountainous area with altitudes ranging from . Average temperatures are with maximum temperature of . There may be frost in June and July, with light but persistent rainfall in the winter. Annual rainfall is from , with the period from September to February having the most rain. In the lower parts the average temperature is and average annual rainfall is . There are many rivers and waterfalls. Atlantic Forest in the park The park is in the Atlantic Forest biome. The vegetation is mainly montane and submontane rainforest. In the highest parts of the park there are small areas of dense high montane rainforest and alpine meadows on shallow and stony soils. There is dense lowland rainforest in the areas below . Some of the forest is well preserved, with a continuous canopy of more than , while other areas have secondary formations with a lower and more open canopy. The park interior has areas that are rich in bamboos, particularly Guadua tagoara. An inventory of vascular species published in 2011 identified 1,143 species in 528 genera and 140 families. There was rich biodiversity among the Myrtaceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae, Rubiaceae and Bromeliaceae. The inventory did not include all species of herbs, lianas and epiphytes. More than 60 of the species were endangered. Evidence of illegal logging of palmito-ju√ßara (Euterpe edulis) is common in some parts of the park. About 1,200 southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides) remain in Brazil, of whom more than half live in the park. Other endangered species include the jaguar (Panthera onca) and the black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga). More than 220 species of birds have been identified, but the actual number may be much higher. Species include Amazon parrots, blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), white-necked hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus) and black hawk- eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus). Activities Taquaral River The park headquarters in S√£o Miguel Arcanjo has an Environmental Education Center with a Zoology Museum and a library with many publications on ecology, animals and plants. The Marco Ant√¥nio dos Santos Costa center has an auditorium for 40 people where environmental videos are displayed. There are waterfalls and adventure sports. The park has several trails with varying degrees of difficulty, some taking more than a day, and some requiring a guide. The Figueira trail in the Sete Barras center is long and leads to a huge old fig tree. The two main trails are near the park headquarters. The Rio Taquaral trail starts at the forest police inspection station and ends on the banks of the Taquaral River. It is long and is marked with signs for students. It shows the succession from fields to secondary forest that is being regenerated to undisturbed native forest. The Represa (Dam) trail follows winding paths and crosses streams through dense greenery, and is best visited with monitors who can interpret the environment. The Represa e Fornos (Dam and Furnaces) trail has medium difficulty, requires a guide, and takes about three and a half hours. It passes the ruins of five kilns used to make charcoal in the 1940s when the park was a farm.

Burstall gives an incorrect birth year. was an English research chemist, among the first to study and seek an antidote to mustard gas during the First World War. She received an MBE for her top secret wartime work, which has since come to light.  Early life and education  Micklethwait was born in Blackwood, Yorkshire, the first daughter of a Yorkshire farmer and a Parisian mother. Biographies generally give 1868 as her year of birth, but this is disputed by official records. She was educated privately and then studied at the Swanley Horticultural College in Kent, which admitted women from 1897, when she was 30 years old.[1] In 1898 Micklethwait joined the Royal College of Science (later Imperial College) and attained her degree, the Associateship of the Royal College of Science, in 1901.[1]  Pre-war research at the Royal College of Science (now Imperial College)  After obtaining her degree, Micklethwait 'carried out a substantial and varied series of researches' in the field of organic chemistry, a relatively new area of science that would be of major global importance.[1] From 1901 to 1912 she worked mainly with G T Morgan, later Sir Gilbert Morgan, during which she received a Beit Research Fellowship for the excellence of her work. With Morgan, Micklethwait co-authored 22 research papers and became one of the most prolific female authors of chemistry publications of her time.  Wartime research  Officially, Frances Micklethwait's MBE was for her work as an 'Experimental Chemical Supply Officer, Trench Warfare Department, Ministry of Munitions.' But the true value of her research was in chemical warfare: \\"[o]fficial secrecy has obscured the wartime activities of the chemist Frances Micklethwait, who... joined a research team at Imperial College investigating chemical weapons during the War. She was among the first to study mustard gas, a particularly pernicious chemical because, unlike chlorine, it is invisible and its effects are not immediately noticeable\\". A colleague later recalled noticing her and her fellow workers 'popping into the corridor every now and again to see how the experimental blisters on their arms were getting on.' ... Micklethwait was decorated after the War, but because the work was top-secret, its significance has only recently begun to be appreciated.' At Imperial, Micklethwait worked alongside Martha Annie Whiteley, one of the inventors of tear gas.  Post-war research  Micklethwait worked briefly for the Boots Pure Drug Co. and then returned to Swanley Horticultural College in 1921, becoming its Principal in 1922. She also worked on the Index for the revised edition of Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry.  Associations  *1920 ‚Äì Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Early career  Post joined the KNAW Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands in 1989 before being appointed full-time Assistant Professor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (1998‚Äì2001). Five years later, he moved with his lab to Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, and was appointed Associate Professor of Medicine and of Physiology (2001‚Äì2010). In July 2002, Post returned to the Netherlands as a Professor of Vascular Physiology at Maastricht University and Professor of Angiogenesis in Tissue Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology (until 2010). Since January 2004, he has been Chair of Physiology and Vice Dean of Biomedical Technology at Maastricht University.  Cultured meat research  Post lectures at the 2015 World Economic Forum on cultured meat. As the Dutch government cut down subsidies for cultured meat development at the universities of Utrecht, Amsterdam and Eindhoven in 2009, jeopardising the Netherlands' international leading role, Maastricht University was able to attract an anonymous foreign investor (in 2013 revealed as Google co-founder Sergey Brin) and resume the research. In December 2011, Post and his team announced to conduct practical experiment into the production of lab-grown meat. They planned to produce a cultured hamburger by September 2012. The costs of the world's first in-vitro burger were 250,000 euros. Eventually, it was presented to the public, cooked and eaten on 5 August 2013 at a press conference in London. Austrian nutritional scientist Hanni R√ºtzler judged it to be just like meat, although not yet as juicy. In June 2013 and October 2015, Post claimed that in the future, it would be possible for citizens themselves to grow their own meat at home within a period of 7 to 9 weeks. Also in October 2015, Post and food technologist Peter Verstrate announced the launch of their new company Mosa Meat, which seeks to bring cultured meat on the market in 2020. Post estimated that if the traditional meat industry were to be entirely replaced by lab- grown meat, the global cattle population could be reduced from 0.5 billion to about 30,000. In 2016 he was selected to join the SingularityU The Netherlands faculty due to his pioneering work in cultured meat and the sustainability of food production. From April 2017 on, Post's team was experimenting with tanks of 25,000 litres to grow meat in. The scientists were looking for an alternative for the foetal calf serum (a by-product of animal agriculture) to grow the cells in to be able to operate independently from the regular meat industry.

The bill contains a boost to defense spending as well as bipartisan health programs.  Background  Normally Congress must enact appropriations legislation by the beginning of the fiscal year in October. On September 28, 2016, Congress passed a continuing resolution, the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act which extended funding at the previous year's levels up to December 9, 2016. In November 2016, shortly after the 2016 presidential election, the incoming Trump administration advocated for a second continuing resolution funding the government only until the end of March, to allow the incoming administration influence over the 2017 budget. The House Republican leadership acceded to this plan, although some lawmakers expressed concern that delaying the final appropriations legislation would distract Congress from other priorities during the beginning of Trump's administration.  Legislative history  H.R. 2028 originally contained the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, which passed the House of Representatives on May 1, 2015. Text was later stricken and replaced with the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, which passed the Senate on May 12, 2016 and was sent back to the House. The text was again stricken and replaced with the continuing resolution on December 8, 2016, where it was passed 326‚Äì96. The United State Senate passed the legislation the following day 63-36 just an hour before the midnight deadline, averting a potential government shutdown. The passage of the bill in the Senate was delayed after Democrats objected to the fact that an extension of health benefits for retired miners would not last until the end of the year, but a compromise was made to take up the matter in January. Provisions As reported by The Hill, total government expenditures remain at $1.07 trillion. However the Department of Defense and Department of State will receive a combined $8 billion increase through the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, which is not subject to the spending caps of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The bill includes $170 million for drinking water safety grants and a lead exposure registry in order to address the Flint water crisis, and a $4.1 billion flood relief package including community rebuilding grants, storm damage prevention programs, and repair of damaged highways. Also, the bill funds the 21st Century Cures Act with $872 million toward medical research, Food and Drug Administration reforms, and state grants to address the opioid epidemic. It contains a provision making it easier for the incoming 115th Congress to temporarily reduce the amount of time after retirement a general must spend to be appointed Secretary of Defense, indirectly allowing James Mattis to assume office in 2017. Finally, the bill corrects a drafting error made in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 regarding hours of service rules for truck drivers.

Store Strandstr√¶de 2 dates from before 1731. Nyhavn 1 was built in 1753 for metalsmith Peder J√∏rgensen Ambus. Wine merchant Lars Fogh Rasmusen moved his business, founded two years prior, to Nyhavn 1 in 1776. In 1782, the company was taken over by Peder Handerup (born 1746) who had married Tasmussen's widow, Dorothea (n√©e Helt). In 1792 the company was taken over by Johan Friderich Inselmann (1753-1798) and in 1798 by Niels Hansen (1769-1801). Niels Hansen's widow Bolette Kirstine (n√©e Hvidberg) took over the operations after his death in 1801. In 1808, she married Frantz Diderich J√ºrgensen (1777-1840) who then took over the company. He merged Nyhavn 1 with Store Strandstr√¶de 2 in 1817. The company was in 1840 taken over by their son-in-law Niels Ferdinand Lorck (1816-1844) and after his death in 1844 by their daughter Johanne Marie n√©e J√ºrgensen with her brother , Hans Ludvig J√ºrgensen as manager. The company was taken over by Magnus Vilhelm Foght (1831'1894) in 1857 and by George Lorange om 1887. In 1896, it was acquired by Detlev Frederik Schnack. Royal Danish Theatre actor and chamber singer Peter Ludvig Nicolai Schram lived on the second floor of Nyavn 1 from 1860 to 1875. The Thingvalla Line and later Scandinavian America Line had their sales office in the building. The ships departed from Amerikakaj in the Freeport.

Invalid data is inserted to compare the output against the given input. Negative testing is also known as failure testing or error path testing. When performing negative testing exceptions are expected. This shows that the application is able to handle improper user behavior. Users input values that do not work in the system to test its ability to handle incorrect values or system failure.  Purpose  * The purpose of negative testing is to prevent the application from crashing and it also helps improve the quality of an application by detecting defects. * Negative testing helps you to improve the testing coverage of the application. * Negative testing makes the application more stable and reliable. * Negative testing together with positive testing allows users to test the application with any valid (or invalid) input data.  Benefits of negative testing  Negative testing is done to check that product deals properly with the circumstance for which it is not programmed. The fundamental aim of this testing is check that how bad data is taken care of by the systems, and appropriate errors are shown to client when bad data is entered. Both positive and negative testing play important role. Positive testing ensures that application does what it is implied for and perform each function as expected. Negative testing is opposite of positive testing. Negative testing discovers diverse approaches to make the application crash and handle the crash effortlessly. Example * If there is a text box that can only take numeric values but the user tries to type a letter, the correct behavior would be to display a message such as \\"(Incorrect data) Please enter a number.\\" * If user is to fill the name field, there are ground rules that name text is mandatory to fill, name box shouldn't have values other than letters (no numeric values and special characters). Negative test cases could be a name containing numeric values or special characters. The correct behavior of the system would be to not display those invalid characters.  Parameters for writing Negative test cases  There are two basic techniques that help to write the sufficient test cases to cover the most of the functionalities of the system. Both these techniques are used in positive testing as well. The two parameters are: * Boundary-value analysis Boundary indicates limit to something. In this parameter, test scenarios are designed in such a way that it covers the boundary values and validate how application behaves on these boundary values. * Example If there is an application that accepts Ids ranging from 0‚Äì255. Hence in this scenario, 0,255 will form the boundary values. The values within the range of 0‚Äì255 will constitute the positive testing. Any inputs going below from 0 and input going above from 255 will be considered invalid and will constitute negative testing.

He also played for the San Diego Chargers, and San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL), as well as one game for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He went on to appear in 25 career NFL games, while making nine starts. Early career Allen played college football at the University of California, Davis for the Aggies.

Professional career Allen was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the eighth round (212th overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, Allen played in all 16 regular season games for the Dolphins, where he was used primarily as a cornerback. He remained on the team through the off-season but was waived in mid-August. The Toronto Argonauts were struggling heavily by August 1981 after losing eight consecutive games. Along with five other cut NFL players, Allen was signed in an attempt to improve the team. Allen and Elbert Roberts were expected to replace Marcellus Greene and Hank Williams. The Argonauts instead started Allen at safety for his CFL debut against the Calgary Stampeders on September 7, 1981. He was released the following week after starting only one game for the Argonauts. The Argonauts later re-signed Allen and traded him to the BC Lions for running back Calvin Murray, although Allen played no games for the Lions. Before the 1982 season, the San Diego Chargers signed Allen. He played in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. The secondary unit was praised for allowing only 3 points despite fielding two new starters, Allen and Andre Young. He went on to start in nine regular season games with the Chargers. Allen intercepted a pass from Terry Bradshaw intended for Lynn Swann in the Chargers' first round playoff win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Chargers lost in the second round to the Miami Dolphins. Prior to the 1983 season, the Chargers traded Allen to the San Francisco 49ers for a draft pick, but Allen was cut during the preseason and never played for the 49ers.

She was the College's sole American caretaker, though her husband Thomas Davidson Christie was the named president. She wrote letters and kept diaries which are part of the Minnesota Historical Society Christie Collection and provide a first-hand account of the Armenian massacre of 1895, Ottoman Turkish politics in the pre- and post-World War I era, the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and its aftermath. During the 1909 Riots and unrest, she refused to abandon the school, students and refugees who had fled there, guarding up to 5,000 people under her protection and hoisting the American flag. Early life Sarah Carmelite Brewer, known as Carmelite, was born in Lee Center, Illinois on 25 April 1852 to Elizabeth (n√©e Pratt) and Rev. James Brewer. On her father's side of the family, she was descended from Captain John Brewer, veteran of the French and Indian War and a relative of the Supreme Court Justice, David Josiah Brewer. Carmelite was a cousin of Rev. Josiah Brewer, father of Justice Brewer, who was an early missionary and school founder sent by the American Board to Greece and Turkey. He was one reason Thomas and Carmelite ended up in Turkey. Her father was a preacher who graduated from Williams College some 30 years after the Haystack Prayer Meeting which resulted in the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. After graduation he taught in schools in the South. He joined his brother Ira after riding from Montgomery, Alabama to Lee County in 1847. James was a farmer and a principal of the new academy in Lee Center in 1850. He was ordained in 1859. She graduated in 1871 from the Rockford Seminary for Women, a progressive academy. Rockford was the sister college of Beloit College in Wisconsin. She taught school in Lee Center until she married a graduate of Beloit, Thomas Davidson Christie on 14 March 1872.  Missionary period Carmelite joined her new husband in Wisconsin, where he taught at Beloit College and the University of Wisconsin, while working on his master's degree, and she began their family with the births of their first two daughters, Elizabeth Norton. Thomas and his young family went to Andover Theological Seminary for his further studies. Their daughter Anna Carmelite was born in there in 1875. Daughter Elizabeth died of scarlet fever in 1876. Thomas graduated and was ordained as a minister the next year. Carmelite was appointed as a missionary by the American Board of Missions in Asiatic Turkey in 1877. Thomas, Carmelite and their young daughter Anna moved to Marash, Turkey that same year, where he taught at the Central Turkey Theological Seminary. In addition to preparing young men for college in the period between 1877 and 1893, she expanded their family to include: Emerson Brewer, Mary Phelps, Paul Theodore, Agnes Emily, and Jean Ogilvy. Carmelite and the children returned to the Beloit for the period from 1888 to 1890 for the children's education and then returned to Turkey. In 1893 the family moved to Tarsus to take up a post at St. Paul's College. Carmelite by character and situation assumed non-traditional roles overseas. As part of his duties, Thomas left Turkey to raise money or went to surrounding mission stations to support them. In addition to her family responsibilities, she was involved in the activities of St. Paul's College and the education of women and a supporter of suffrage for unmarried women. After the 1895 massacre at Marash, Carmelite wrote letters describing the events which were published in American newspapers. She reported on deaths, woundings, damage to the schools in Marash and threats to the missionary workers. Her reports were personal, having spent fifteen years among those who were living through the crisis and in one letter, she reported that she and her husband had been warned regarding violence which might spread to Tarsus. By August, the rioting had reached them, though the Christies were not at the school when it was looted. In the face of the ongoing violence, the family fled to Mersina, and eventually Carmelite returned with the children to the United States between 1897 and 1898 for their safety and schooling. =1909 riots= Carmelite's son-in-law Rev. Miner Rogers, Reverend Herbert Adams Gibbons and her husband went to the annual conference of Armenian ministers and expatriate missionaries in Adana, Turkey on 13 April 1909. While they were there Rogers and another missionary Henry Maurer, were killed by gunfire during the Adana massacre. The men were carrying water to put out a fire in order to protect a missionary run dispensary. Thomas Christie could not immediately return to Tarsus. During the week he was away, some of the rioters went to Tarsus. Locals joined them in setting the Tarsus Armenian quarter on fire. Through Carmelite's efforts, the school survived despite protecting around 5,000 refugees on the grounds of the College. When regular soldiers began to join in with the violence and the mob turned toward the campus, Carmelite raised an American flag and refused the evacuation request of the consular saying, \\"I prefer to die with my students and the Armenian people than to hand them over to Turks and save myself.\\" The campus was surrounded by the mob, which replaced the water in the fire extinguishing system with kerosene to torch the school and refugees, when word to cease the hostilities was received from the Young Turks in Constantinople. Thomas and Gibbons returned to tell of Rogers' death to their own wives, and break the news to his daughter Mary and her infant child. Carmelite nursed and comforted the injured and dying, provided food for them and she and Helen Gibbons sewed clothes for infants. For two weeks after the violence, Carmelite was called upon to give constant care to the sick, the children of the refugees and orphans. However, within months of the events, the school was back in operation. Carmelite gave a glowing report of their progress under her leadership as acting president while her husband was back in the states. =Results of the Tehcir Law of 1915 and World War I= The Christies were at St. Paul's when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers at the start of WWI. The Tehcir (forced displacement) Law and another law which allowed expropriation and confiscation of Armenian property was passed by the Ottoman Parliament in May 1915. Teachers and students at St. Paul's were ordered to leave Tarsus for Syria. Thomas traveled in June 1915 to Constantinople to request that the government not deport teachers or students. He was not allowed to return to Tarsus for the duration of the conflict. A short time later, Carmelite arranged for her family and future son-in-law to leave for America but she stayed. During the War, she kept the College open, distributed relief supplies and chronicled events in a summary she sent to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions after the war ended. In her summary, Carmelite chronicles how the Turkish Army requested use of their halls for regimental soldiers and officers, for use a hospital during the cholera and typhus epidemic in 1915, and as a quarters to house English prisoners of war. Carmelite negotiated with the authorities, making small concessions during the war which allowed them to keep operating the college. In addition, she provided aid to refugees, writing, \\"...100,000 exiles were said to have passed Tarsus en route for regions beyond. Of these, we helped as many as we could with money, food and clothing where it was possible by protecting them. Some of these we hid, for others we found work that counted as Government service, and so saved them from being deported further.\\" Carmelite made regular visits to families, local officials and the military (including several audiences with Enver Pasha). Her diary chronicled the stream of Armenians from all over Turkey that passed through Tarsus. Most were on foot and were being directed to Syria. She also noted the wounded coming back from the front and the conditions which ethnic Turks and Armenians suffered during the war. Thomas returned to briefly to Tarsus in 1919, not a well man. Diary Carmelite made entries in a diary from 1868 to 1931. About 20 of these volumes, along with correspondence, address books and memorandums are in the Minnesota Historical Society's archives. They have been used by historians and researchers. Her entries during her time at Tarsus are controversial in the context of interpretation events surround Turkish, Armenian, Kurdish, Greek, various political and religious groups. Rev. Richard Walker Rockwell supplied Arnold Toynbee with what was reported to be a transcribed copy of Mrs. Christie's diary, with many peoples names omitted or noted with initials. Toynbee edited the \\"Blue Book\\" in 1916 and included some entries of Mrs. Christie. At the time, Turkish critics said the Blue Book was an exaggeration, events fabricated by missionaries and was clearly a piece of WWI British propaganda. They pointed out that Toynbee pressured Rev. Rockwell for names, so as editor he could assure the reader these people existed. Toynbee did not get the names but included Mrs. Christie's entries. In general, her diaries document her activities and her opinions about events around her, including her family.  Later life  In 1919, Carmelite and Thomas returned to the United States, where briefly Thomas became pastor at the Union Church in Palm Springs, California. After the couple's daughter Agnes, who had been suffering from ill health, committed suicide in December 1919, the couple's youngest daughter, Jean, went to Tarsus to help her mother prepare to return to the United States. They made their home in Eagle Rock California among a large community of Armenians. Thomas died in 1921. In the last years of her life, Carmelite lived in Pasadena with her daughter Jean, who taught at Occidental College. Death and legacy  Carmelite died on October 17, 1931, in Pasadena. She and Thomas are buried in Newton Cemetery (Massachusetts) in the American Missionary Board plot. Sarah Carmelite Brewer Christie gavestone https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88265706 The Minnesota Historical Society was given a trunk full of Christie family letters in 1965. The Christie family was asked to give or make copies of other letters and diaries for a permanent Christie collection. In 2016, the collection occupies over 20 cubic feet for Thomas & his family and about the same for his father and siblings. This collection includes Carmelite's continuous diary she kept from 1865 to 1931, giving important historical, first person accounts of the turbulent times of Turkey's history at the turn of the twentieth century through the First World War.  Children  Five of Carmelite's six surviving children were born in Turkey. The more notable have a common thread that echoed Carmelite's own life of social service and education. Anna Carmelite Christie (1875-1910) was born in Wisconsin and traveled to Turkey with her parents when they moved there. She had poor health and though schooled in both Europe and the United States, she spent much of her life living in the U.S. quietly pursuing musical interests and performing charitable works. Emerson Brewer Christie (1878-1967) was a noted linguist and ethnologist. He graduated from Yale, taught at St. Paul's College and then in the Philippines. He also taught at University of Michigan and Temple University. He was Chief of the US State Department's Bureau of Translation from 1928-1944. Mary Phelps Christie (1881-1975) was born in and spent a great deal of her life in Turkey. She attended Bryn Mawr College and studied at the Hartford Female Seminary, graduating in 1908. Mary married Daniel Miner Rogers (1882-1909) and they joined her parents in Tarsus. After the death of Rogers, she returned with their child to the United States. In 1911 she returned to Tarsus to teach. She met her second husband William Nute and they married in Tarsus. Mary and her child returned to the States so William could complete his medical training. They returned to Turkey where Mary taught and William ran rural medical clinics, until their retirement, when she returned to California. Paul Theodore Christie (1883-1959) was born and raised in Turkey. As his siblings, he was sent away as a teenager for further education. Paul attended schools in Greece, Switzerland and Germany. He graduated from Hotchkiss School in 1903 and Harvard University in 1907. He was a French teacher and athletic coach at St. Georges School until World War II. He retired and during the war worked at a Grumman airplane factory as a riveter in California. He continued to teach swimming until he died. Agnes Emily Christie (1887-1919) attended schools in Europe and the United States, though her education was interrupted because of poor health at various times. Trained as a dental hygienist, she worked in that field until she became depressed and committed suicide. Jean Ogilvie Christie (1891-1984) graduated from Wellesley College in 1915. She returned to Turkey and taught in Constantinople. Jean was forced to stop teaching there in 1917 and worked with the YMCA in France. Jean helped her mother return to the United States and settle in California in 1920. She was a teacher at Occidental College and at the University of California, Berkeley. She was married to Eugene V. Lien.

Built in 1813, it is a prominent local example of Federal period architecture, and the town's only documented 19th-century tavern house built out of brick. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Tavern on Mutton Hill stands in a cluster of residential buildings in an otherwise rural area of northeastern Charlotte, on the west side of Church Hill Road south of its junction with Mutton Hill Road. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a redstone foundation and window sills. The gable ends each have two chimneys, joined by a raised parapet. The front facade is six bays wide, with the main entrance set in the bay left of center; it is topped by a rectangular transom with a sunburst pattern. The interior retains period woodwork and finishes, although there have been numerous alterations, including the removal of some walls and the addition of partitions. The former ballroom space on the second floor, extending across the front of the building, has survived with little alteration. with The tavern was built in 1813 by Nathaniel Newell, the son of the local Congregationalist minister Abel Newell, who died the previous year in a typhus epidemic. Newell was the town's wealthiest citizen and a prominent civic leader, serving in the state legislature. In addition to owning this tavern (where he lived with his family), he owned a local tannery, and a dry goods store in Burlington. The tavern is located on what was formerly the principal stagecoach route through Charlotte, and an early alignment of United States Route 7. The tavern was owned by the Edgerton family for more than a century after passing out of the hands of the Newell family.

He grew up in Macon Ga., Anderson SC, and Dalton GA with his parents, Elaine & Woody Sr, and his younger brother Mark. Woody was a natural artist who impressed his parents, Woody Sr. & Elaine Cornwell, with his drawings at a very early age. He grew up a boy scout and an avid adventure seeker. Career Woody's art career started in Dalton Ga. when he was commissioned by the local high school for a spirit mural in the common area and a pencil drawing of the school itself. After high school and a brief enrollment at the University of Georgia, Woody followed his passion and enrolled at the Savannah College of Art & Design. After graduation from SCAD Woody moved to Atlanta, enrolled at Georgia State University, and began to lay the groundwork for his first gallery venture. Soon Woody and his roommate Marshal Avett founded the Silver Ceiling Gallery in their own apartment. After a few years of show at Silver Ceiling, Woody and Marshal convinced a handful of friends to create an art collective a few doors down from Silver Ceiling. In 1997, Eyedrum Art & Music Gallery was founded. It was a collective effort where each board member took responsibility for rent although no one lived there. Their ambitious venture paid off in a golden era of experimental art and music that lasted well into the 00's before changes began to distance Woody from the gallery.

The main offerings to the deity are Dhara, Pinvilakku, Pushpanjali, Payasam and Koovalamala.  Legend  Gopuram (tower) of the temple The present temple was built by the 'Madathil Raja' (Edappally raja) in 825 AD. He belonged to Madathil palace near Parippu. The local chieftain Idathil Raja was not on good terms with him and both rajas devoted to Lord Shiva does not wish to meet at the Mahadeva temple that they visited regularly. As a solution, two 'Balikkalpuras' (traditional frontage) were constructed in the temple, unlike the other temples in Kerala has only a single Balikkalpura. In the past, almost 141 Nair families settled in Parippu. Ancient art forms like 'Ezhamathukali' and 'Kavanayeru' attained great progress there. Parippu, which is close to the water bodies gained political prominence by the presence of raja's military unit and trade relations.

There are numerous ways to create an inbred strain and each of these strains are unique. Genetically engineered mice can be considered a coisogenic strain if the only difference between the engineered mouse and a wild-type mouse is a specific locus. Coisogenic strains can be used to investigate the gene function of a certain locus. Coisogenic strains can be induced chemically or through radiation however, other types of alterations within the genome may also occur. Coisogenic strains may also occur through a spontaneous mutation that occurs in an inbred strain. To create a coisogenic strain through breeding, a mouse with the specific mutation on a locus is mated to an inbred strain (e.g., C57BL/6J) mouse. The offspring of the mutated mouse with the inbred strain has a 50% chance of carrying the mutation. From this, the offspring with the mutation can be mated to a heterozygous carrier which then creates offspring with 75% of the genetic background. This backcrossing is then continued until more than 99% is genetic background and the mutated locus is inherited. However, if the specific mutation cannot be passed on, heterozygous animals should be used to breed with the original inbred strain. Full-sib mating are used to maintain coisogenic strains if the specific gene locus is homozygous. However, a regular backcrossing of these coisogenic strains with their standard parental strain is preferred in order to avoid subline divergence.

They have very weak O-O bonds and are thus generally unstable compounds.M. Klussmann, Chem. Eur. J. 2018, 24, 4480‚Äì4496.  Properties  Alkenyl peroxides decompose readily by homolytic O-O bond cleavage into two radicals, generating an oxyl radical and an alkenyloxyl- or Œ±-oxo-alkyl radical. Decomposition of alkenyl peroxides by homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond The significant weakness of the O-O bond can be explained by formation of the resonance stabilized alkenyloxyl radical and the strong carbonyl bond, respectively.N. Sebbar, J. W. Bozzelli, H. Bockhorn, J. Phys. Chem. A 2004, 108, 8353‚Äì8366. This reasoning also applies to aryl peroxides. Both compound classes thus have significantly weaker O-O bonds than other peroxides.B. Schweitzer-Chaput, T. Kurt√©n, M. Klussmann, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 11848‚Äì11851. Because of this weak bond, alkenyl peroxides are generally only postulated as reactive intermediates. An exception is the case of some few heteroarylperoxides, which were long-lived enough to be characterized.H. Kropf, M. Ball, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1976, 2331‚Äì2338.  Occurrence  = In the atmosphere = Alkenyl hydroperoxides (R1 = H) have been postulated as reactive intermediates in atmospheric chemistry.R. Atkinson, J. Arey, Atmospheric Environment 2003, 37, Supplement 2, 197-219.L. Vereecken, J. S. Francisco, Chem. Soc. Rev. 2012, 41, 6259‚Äì6293, .R. Gutbrod, R. N. Schindler, E. Kraka, D. Cremer, Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996, 252, 221‚Äì229,. They are formed via ozonolysis of alkenes in the atmosphere and form hydroxyl radicals upon decay, which play an important role in the decomposition of pollutants in the air. During day-time, hydroxyl radicals form predominantly photochemically by irradiation with light; whereas in the dark during night-time, the formation via alkenyl peroxides is believed to be their major source. = In solution = Alkenyl peroxides can be formed by acid catalyzed condensation of ketones with organic hydroperoxides or hydrogen peroxide. This has been suggested based on the characterization of the corresponding products of decomposition. Alkenyl peroxides could also occur as unwanted byproducts in the Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation when using hydrogen peroxide, which would diminish the effectiveness of this reaction.  Applications  The radicals formed from alkenyl peroxides can be utilized in organic radical reactions. For example, they can mediate hydrogen atom abstraction reactions and thus lead to the functionalization of C-H bonds,M. Klussmann, B. Schweitzer-Chaput, Synlett 2016, 27, 190-202. or they can be used to introduce ketone residues by addition of the alkenyloxyl radicals to alkenes.B. Schweitzer-Chaput, J. Demaerel, H. Engler, M.

Shortly after the German occupation of the Netherlands (1940) the factory of Josiah Russell & Co. in Hillegersberg was voluntarily handed over to a local competitor, N.V. Handelmaatschappij v/h J.C. Tims, whose own factory had been destroyed during the bombardment of Rotterdam. This action was probably prompted by the fear that the factory, being British-owned, would otherwise be assigned to a German Verwalter (caretaker). After the Second World War J.C. Tims officially took over the Josiah Russell factory (1949). In 1969 N.V. Handelmaatschappij v/h J.C. Tims was taken over by the much larger, Heineken-owned soft drink company Vrumona (Bunnik). In 2016, inspired by the history of the Josiah Russell company, Vrumona introduced a series of soft drink flavours under the new brand name Russell & Co.

At the outbreak of the Swedish war with Bremen in 1666, he enlisted as a pikeman in Swedish service, but was soon commissioned; reaching captain's rank in 1668. Gyllenstierna undertook a grand tour 1669-1672, which also included a visit with the Knights of Malta. When the French in 1672 attacked the Dutch Republic, Gyllenstierna became captain in a regiment of the Prince-Bishopric of Munster that fought against the Dutch, but soon became major in a regiment of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabruck that was in Dutch service, and there promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1674.Anrep, Gustaf (1858-64).

In 1693 he was promoted to major- general of cavalry and appointed governor of J√∂nk√∂ping county; in 1696 to lieutenant-general, and governor of Swedish Wismar; and in 1698 to general of cavalry, and governor-general of Bremen-Verden. At the outbreak of the Great Northern War, Gyllenstierna who was commander-in-chief of the Swedish forces in Germany, crossed the Elbe, and beat the Danes at Reinbek. In 1702 he commanded the Swedish reinforcements that were transferred from Germany to Poland. In 1708, he commanded the forces of the Lower Saxon Circle that occupied Hamburg, and was rewarded for the successful operation with promotion to field-marshal. Although a royal councillor since 1705, Gyllenstierna remained in Germany until 1711, when he returned to Sweden, becoming president of the Board of War. Between 1714 and 1719 he was also commander-in-chief of the Swedish forces in Sk√•ne. Political role Gyllenstierna belonged to the cautious senior officers who hesitated before the aggressive plans of Charles XII. His objections lead to the shelving of a planned attack on the Electorate of Saxony in 1701; he also argued against the invasion of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. After the battle of Poltava, Gyllenstierna opposed the rearmament policy advocated by Magnus Stenbock, as too onerous for the country, and in the Royal Council he joined with his son-in-law Arvid Horn in his opposition to the absent King.

Although their arrival in Asia is not well-dated, early Neanderthals occupied the region apparently until about 100,000 years ago. At this time, Homo sapiens seems to have replaced them in one of the first anatomically modern expansions out of Africa. In their turn, starting around 80,000 years ago, Neanderthals seem to have replaced Homo sapiens in Southwest Asia. They inhabited the region until about 55,000 years ago. In Southwest Asia, Neanderthals left well-preserved skeletal remains in Israel, Syria, and Iraq. Remains in Turkey, Lebanon, and Iran are fragmentary. No Neanderthal skeletal remain has ever been found to the south of Jerusalem, and although there are Middle Palaeolithic Levallois points in Jordan and in the Arabian peninsula, it is unclear whether these were made by Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans. Neanderthals further to the east, such as those found in Uzbekistan and Asian Russia are known as Central and North Asian Neanderthals. As of 2013, although many more Neanderthal remains have been discovered in Southwest Asia than in North Asia, where genetic studies have succeeded, no attempt at extracting DNA from Southwest Asian Neanderthals has ever been successful. Early hominins (to 100 ka) One of the southernmost Neanderthals: Homo neandertalensis fossil from Tabun Cave, Israel. 120.000-50.000 BC. Israel Museum. As the Levant is the landbridge to Eurasia, Dmanisi remains in Georgia from 1.81 Ma suggest that hominins passed through the Levant some time before this (unless they crossed the Bab el-Mandeb strait into Arabia). The oldest known hominin specimen from the Levant, and from all the Middle East, is the Zuttiyeh skull, found by Francis Turville-Petre near the Sea of Galilee in 1927. It has not been dated, but lithic industries suggest it dates from 350-250 ka (Bar-Yosef 1992). Though it has some modern characteristics, it has been classified as a specimen of Homo heidelbergensis. Other known hominin fossils in Southwest Asia older than 100 ka include Shanidar 2 and 4, as well as Tabun C1. All three have at one point been classified as Neanderthals, although the latter two are now usually called pre-Neanderthals. In part because none are well-dated these attributions have all been challenged.  Early AMHs in the Levant (100 to 80 ka)  It is believed that anatomically modern humans first entered the Levant by 130 ‚Äì 100 ka (Gr√ºn 2005) from Africa during the Last Interglacial, a hot, parched, period in Africa (Scholz et al. 2007). =Environment= Goat Œ¥13C values from c. 92 ka collected at Qafzeh Cave show that goats were eating, depending on the season, between 20 and 50% of C4 plants. These plants are better adapted to dry and hot climates than the much more common C3 plants. Although it was already established that North Africa was arid in the early Last Glacial, Scholz et al. (2007)'s conclusions would extend this to the Levant, making the region in this period more arid than previously thought. Frumkin et al. (2011) arrived at a similar conclusion of a hot and arid Levant by examining changes through time of lake levels and in the formation of cave formations.  Return of Neanderthals to the Levant (80 to 55 ka)  Potential causes for the initial extinction of modern humans from the Levant and subsequent replacement by Neanderthals around 80 ka include a short-term extreme environmental change in the Levant and environmental changes in the regions neighbouring the Levant. The only long-term environmental change that has been found in the Levant at this period is an increase in rainfall (Hallin et al. 2012), and some moderate cooling of the region (Bar-Yosef 1992, Harrison and Bates 1991),Harrison, D. L., & Bates, P. J. J. (1991). Felidae. In The mammals of Arabia (2nd ed., pp. 156‚Äì172). Sevenoaks: Harrison Zoological Museum. which would not predict a hominin extinction (Hallin et al. 2012). Hence, a short- lived intense environmental change (such as a volcanic winter of 6 to 1000 years caused by the Toba supereruption, Rampino and Self 1992) might have caused modern human extinction, especially if the modern human Levantine population was low (Shea 2008).Shea, J. J. (2008). Transitions or turnovers ? Climatically-forced extinctions of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals in the East Mediterranean Levant. Quaternary Science Reviews, 1‚Äì18. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2008.08.015 In this case, Neanderthals could have moved in during or after the modern human evacuation of the region. = Environment = Contrarily to modern humans who arrived in the Levant in a period particularly warm in both Eurasia and Africa, Neanderthals are thought to have entered the Levant in a period of increasing Eurasian coldness and aridity known as the Last Glacial Period (Tchernov 1989).Tchernov, E. (1989). The Middle Paleolithic mammalian sequence and its bearing on the origin of Homo sapiens in the southern Levant. In O. Bar-Yosef & B. Vandermeersch (Eds.), Investigations in South Levantine Prehistory (pp. 25‚Äì42). Oxford: Archaeopress. In the Levant, however, the conditions would have been wetter than those of today and of the preceding interglacial. This is what Hallin et al. (2012) concluded in their study of the Œ¥13C and Œ¥18OŒ¥13C and Œ¥18O are so- called isotopic signatures. They respectively measure the prevalence of the heavier carbon-13 (13C) and oxygen-18 (18O) isotopes over the more common carbon-12 and oxygen-16. C4-pathway plants have relatively more 13C (higher Œ¥13C) than C3-pathway plants. Because C4 plants are better adapted to hot and dry climates than C3 plants, high Œ¥13C values are associated with hot and dry environments. To the contrary, a greater prevalence of 18O (higher Œ¥18O) in (land) animal bones reflects a colder environment: Because 16O is lighter than 18O, water molecules of the form H216O evaporate slightly more readily than those of the H218O form. This difference in evaporation is greater the colder the environment gets, so that rain and snow in colder regions have a lower Œ¥18O value. Animals incorporate the Œ¥13C and Œ¥18O information of their environment and it is possible to extract it from their bones and teeth. values of goat and gazelle enamel from Amud cave in Neanderthals layers dated to 70-53 ka (Glacial Period), after comparing them to values from Qafzeh cave in a modern human layer dated to 92 ka. They found that at Amud, neither the goats nor the gazelle consumed arid-adapted C4 plants, indicating that the environment was not as dry as today. They found the magnitude and pattern of Œ¥18O values in gazelle and goat teeth enamel to indicate that, unlike today, rain fell throughout the year at Amud in the Neanderthal period. Indeed, the variation in Œ¥18O values in the oldest layers of the teeth, formed when the animal is only a few months old, suggested that goats and gazelles were born throughout the year, which today happens only in the Levant in wetter-than- normal conditions. Belmaker et al. (2011) compared the prevalence in caves of microfaunal bones brought back by Barn and Eagle owls, which are known to accumulate large quantities of rodent skeletons. Since owls are opportunistic hunters and will eat any small mammal, the bone assemblage they leave behind are thought to be accurate indicators of the environment, given that rodents, like beetles, are susceptible to small changes in temperature and humidity. The researchers did find changes in microfaunal bone assemblages, but all were expected by taphonomic bias. They therefore concluded that there were no significant changes in the environment of the Levant between 70 and 55 ka.  Return of AMHs to the Levant (after 55 ka)  Unless modern humans started expanding into Eurasia through Arabia (where stone tools but very few human bones have been found), the Levant was most likely the first place Neanderthals lost ground to expanding modern humans. It is unclear why Neanderthals abandoned the Levant or lost it to modern humans. Shea (2008) has argued that Neanderthals were climatically forced out of the region (as modern humans probably were about 75,000 years ago). This is contested. Belmaker et al. (2011) have found that the proportions of microfaunal bones in the Levant between 70 and 55 kya seem stable, despite the fact that small fauna are sensitive to slight changes in temperature or humidity. There would be hence little reason to believe in a slow deterioration of the Neanderthal habitat driving them out by 45 kya. It is possible that climate change drove Neanderthals to extinction quickly some time after 55,000 BP, but Hallin et al. (2012) found strong consistency through time in the Œ¥13C and Œ¥18O values in the teeth of both goats and gazelles, suggesting that the climate was stable in the Levant at this crucial period when Middle Palaeolithic technologies of Neanderthals and early modern humans were replaced by Upper Palaeolithic technology of later modern humans. Although the environment at this period in the Levant seems to have been stable, Shea (2008) suggested that a rapidly changing environment at the border between the Levant and the Sinai could have stimulated the development of the first Upper Palaeolithic technologies. In this scenario, modern humans would only have been able to displace Neanderthals once they had developed this technology. The advanced tools found in Europe in the millennia thereafter would have developed there and then.  Resource gathering strategy  It is believed that Neanderthals and modern humans in the Levant had different resource gathering behaviours. Lieberman and Shea (1994) analysed their lithic hunting technologies and found their differences to suggest Neanderthals hunted more frequently than modern humans. They argue that Neanderthals would have used their intensive hunting strategy to cope with a biodepleted environment, much like the Inuit of the 20th century used to depend largely on hunting. Henry et al. (2017) found that in the Levant the site exploitation territory of Neanderthals was narrow, as they limited themselves to rugged woodlands, while modern humans of the Upper Palaeolithic would have been generalists with large exploitation territories in both the rugged woodlands and levelled steppe landscapes. Although it does seem as if the environment favoured the initial success and eventual demise of Neanderthals, it is still unclear whether differences in their resource gathering strategies reflect differences in the environment, in anatomy, or in intelligence.

It is a suite of detectors on the Juno Jupiter orbiter (launched 2011, orbiting Jupiter since 2016). JADE includes JADE-E, JADE-I, and the EBox. JADE-E and JADE-I are sensors that are spread out on the spacecraft, and the EBox is located inside the Juno Radiation Vault. EBox stands for Electronics Box. JADE-E is for detecting electrons from 0.1 to 100 keV, and there are three JADE-E sensors on Juno. JADE-I is for detecting ions from 5 eV to 50 keV. It is designed to return data in situ on Jupiter's auroral region and magnetospheric plasmas, by observing electrons and ions in this region. It is primarily focused on Jupiter, but it was turned on in January 2016 while still en route to study inter-planetary space (It was several million miles from Jupiter at that time). JADE was built by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), located in the United States in Texas. Two other instruments help understand the magnetosphere of Jupiter, WAVES and MAG. The JEDI instrument measures higher energy ions and electrons and JADE lower energy ones, they are complementary. The JADE sensors, in addition to other materials, also use a special plastic designed to endure the spaceflight conditions. The instrument uses special molded rings of polyether ether ketone (PEEK). By May 2017, some of the first science analysis reported that JADE observed plasma coming up from the upper atmosphere of Jupiter into the Magnetosphere. Some auroral process were compared to ones at Earth, but there seemed to be other processes at work creating the auroras at Jupiter said the JADE project leader, in early 2017. Like Earth's aurora, scientists noted Jupiter's could be effected by the Solar wind, however, many of the ions in the Jupiter aurora were different from those in Earth's. JADE-E Each of the three JADE-E electron sensors weighs 5.25 Kilograms (11.57 pounds, 0.827 stones) with dimensions of 21 cm on all sides; Each JADE-E sensor includes *top-hat electrostatic analyzer *two deflectors *Multi-channel plate detector *anode ring JADE-I The one JADE-I sensors is a spherical top hat electrostatic analyzer combined with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The sensor is made of nickel plated titanium metal. JADE-I sensor weighs 7.55 Kilograms(16.65 pounds, 1.1889 stones). JADE-I can measure ions from 1 to 50 atomic mass units (AMU), with the ability to discern atomic hydrogen, H2+, H3+, oxygen and sulfur.

He is best known for performing traditional music from the Caribbean coast of Colombia and for composing several popular songs. He is particularly remembered for his chalupa version of the Cuban son \\"Rosa, qu√© linda eres\\", first recorded by the Sexteto Habanero God√≠nez in 1918, which has become a standard of the Colombian repertoire. Between 2012 and 2017, he released three solo albums, the last of which, El Orisha de la Rosa, was awarded a Grammy Award. Biography D√≠az was born in Mahates, northern Colombia, on 30 December 1922, to Domingo D√≠az and Felipa Garc√≠a. Both of his parents were singers; his mother was a well known bullerengue singer in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Born into poverty, he along with other children worked the land, planting rice, beans and yucca to feed the family. As such, he did not go to school, and thus, could not read or write. Early on in his life, it was clear that he was musically talented, and was described as a child prodigy. Aged nine, he sang, wrote, and was able to play all kinds of instruments, including the drums, maracas, and guacharaca. In his teenage years, he worked on a plantation as a sugar cutter. Plantations on the Caribbean coast of Colombia were for many years the country's entry point for Cuban music, and in the early 20th century, son cubano began to enter the repertoire of Afro-Colombian genres such as bullerengue and mapal√©. \\"Rosa, qu√© linda eres\\", first recorded by the Sexteto Habanero God√≠nez in 1918 for Victor, was one of the early anonymous sones to cross over in this fashion, soon becoming very popular among plantation workers such as Mag√≠n D√≠az. In Colombia, he has sometimes been referred to as the \\"author\\" of the song, although he could not recall composing it. Nonetheless, he is said to have been enamoured with a Caucasian plantation owner's daughter, Rosa, for whom he would perform the song. Their budding romance was taboo, and could never have happened during that time, so the song was seen as just a melody sung by a humble farmer. Over time, it gained popularity along the coast, and other musicians picked it up. D√≠az was also known for being the actual author of other traditional songs such as \\"Por el Norte, por el Sur\\", \\"Esp√≠ritu maligno\\" and \\"Me amar√°s\\" in the 1930s and 1940s. =In Venezuela= In the 1940s, D√≠az then moved to Venezuela and occasionally performed with the tropical orchestra Billo's Caracas Boys, alongside Cheo Garc√≠a. However, homesickness and caring for his ailing mother meant he moved back to his hometown, Gamero, a small village near San Basilio de Palenque. In the 1970s, D√≠az returned to Venezuela, to work on a construction site in Caracas. A relative of the D√≠az Garc√≠a family, Irene Mart√≠nez, went to Medell√≠n to meet with a lawyer to establish legal protection for the song. D√≠az could not be traced, and so Mart√≠nez was credited as the songwriter. The song was covered multiple times, most notably by Carlos Vives who recorded the song for his album La Tierra del Olvido. =Career revival and death= D√≠az appeared in the 2012 documentary El Tamborero Embrujao, where he performed \\"Rosa\\". In 2014, Daniel Bustos, a philosophy graduate from Universidad Javeriana, established No Name Productions, a platform to raise awareness of the \\"cultural debt\\" owed to D√≠az by his fellow citizens through producing an album and documentary entitled El Orisha de la Rosa. In 2012, an album entitled Mag√≠n y Santiago was published in the Colombian indie scene. Later in 2015, Chilean label Konn Recordings (now based in Colombia), published the double album, Mag√≠n D√≠az y el Sexteto Gamerano. The traditional music is on the first disc, whilst remixes of his songs were on the second, encompassing a wide range of genres such as house, dembow and future bass. His first solo album El Orisha de la Rosa was released in 2017, with many artists such as Vives, Monsieur Perin√©, Tot√≥ la Momposina and Celso Pi√±a collaborating on the project. The album was produced by Manuel Garcia-Orozco and Christian Castagno. According to Afropop WorldWide, El Orisha de la Rosa was \\"the product of three years of research and recording\\". D√≠az was a bearer of the Afro-Colombian culture, maintaining the country's magnificent and tenacious traditional music, bullerengue, which, like the country's Afro-Colombian communities, has survived near constant marginalization and discrimination over the centuries. D√≠az said, \\"Singing for me is as if someone injected me with life‚Ä¶ If I do not sing, I'd die.\\" At the 18th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, El Orisha de la Rosa won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, but the award went to the art directors; El Orisha de la Rosa had also been nominated for Best Folk Album, but lost out to Natalia Lafourcade. He attended the ceremony, but was hospitalized at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on 23 November, and died on 28 November at the age of 94.

Kaffarah is paid violating some action like Fasting, oath, Ihram and Unintentional murder and semi-unintentional murder. Etymology The root of Al-Kaffarah is Kafar (Arabic: ⁄©ŸéŸÅŸéÿ±Ÿé), means covering. In Quran, Kaffarah as a kind of worship is the way that Allah ignore sins and covers them. By Language Kaffarah means \\"a trait that tends to the expiation or atonement of sin\\". By Technique, it means a determined penalty that is done expiation for sin. Types Kaffarah is a special sanction to compensate offense or sin when the particular violation (evil-doing) or unintentional murder is committed. According to the Quran and Ahadith, Kaffarah is classified such as a following categories: =Unintentional murder and semi-unintentional murder= In Islamic law, a person who committed the unintentional murder must release a slave or a fast of two consecutive months and pay Diya unless murder's family forgive him. kaffara is the expiated treat for crimes while blood money (Diya), as the social function is paid to the relative of the dead, the definition describes the relationship between the offender and dead. =Kaffarah of Fasting= Someone who breaking fast without valid reason that accredited in Sharia or by non-observing the fast from the inception or sexual intercourse with one's spouse, have to pay Kaffarah. For the first step he has to release a slave, if it is not possible, he should fast for two successive months, if the second solution doesn't work he must feed sixty poor persons =Kaffarah of oath= If someone breaks the oath, paying Kaffarah is needed. In this case, Kaffarah respectively includes: #Feeding ten poor people or #Dress up to them(poor persons) or #Releasing a slave #If cannot afford the above then Fasting three days =Kaffarah of Hajj= Anyone who violates Ihram restrictions in Hajj, by sexual intercourse, wearing the sewn dress, and killing the hunted animals etc., he have to pay kaffarah. In this situation, Kaffarah respectively includes: #Three days fasting #Feeding sixty people #Slaughtering a goat or even carrying a badnah (carrying seven slaughters) #Pay Sadaqah =Kaffarah of zihar= Zihar had been the kind of the divorces that it was usual among pagan Arabs. If someone commits an act of Zihar then returns to his wife, in the second time, he must pay Kaffarah.

History St. Anne's Guest Home was founded in 1945 in Fargo, North Dakota, to address the needs of the elderly and vulnerable in the community. The original facility in Fargo had 20 beds. St. Anne's second location, St. Michael's Hospital and Nurses' Residence, is now on the National Register of Historic Places. and In 1952 St. Anne's Guest Home moved to Grand Forks, converting St. Michael's Hospital and Nurses' Residence, built in 1907, into a 100-bed facility. St. Anne's remained in this building until 1978 when they were forced to seek a new facility due to their inability to comply with fire safety codes in the old building. In 1981 St. Anne's re-opened in a building that had previously been a convent. The new building had two wings, a north wing and a south wing. The South wing contains 47 \\"basic care units\\" and the North wing contains 30 low-rent efficiency apartments. St. Anne's sustained some damage in the 1997 Red River flood, including the loss of the equipment they had used to make ice cream for their annual ice cream social.

Life  = Family provenance = Anna Katharina Sehnert was born in Schaafheim, at that time a small village in the hills to the east of Darmstadt. Nikolaus Sehnert, her father, was a building worker. Her mother was Anna Katharina Sehnert, born Anna Katharina Kreh. Katharina Sehnert married Jakob Roth (1881‚Äì1944), from nearby Gro√ü-Zimmern. = Life and politics = Before her marriage she worked in domestic service. As it became legally possible for women to participate in politics (though not, yet, to vote), in 1907, she joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1914 the decision of the party leadership to agree to what amounted to a parliamentary truce for the duration of the war created acute and growing tensions within the party which led to a formal split in 1916. Roth was one of those who broke away to form the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). Within the USPD she belonged on the leftwing, and when, after the revolution, the USPD itself split apart, at the end of 1920, she was part of the majority faction that joined up with the newly emerging Communist Party of Germany. In the Communist Party she was seen as a member of the left-wing faction around Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow. She is also described as a \\"women's leader\\". In 1922 she became a member of the Regional Parliament (\\"Landtag\\") for Hesse, taking the seat vacated through the resignation of her party comrade Aloys Rink when he resigned from the fractious Communist Party and returned to the Social Democrats. She was re-elected to the Landtag in 1924. After the short-lived leadership of Fischer and Maslow were deposed dur9ng the Autumn of 1925, Roth found herself a member of the internal party opposition to the new pro-Stalin leadership team around Ernst Th√§lmann. In May 1927 she was expelled from the party. She nevertheless continued to be a member of the Landtag till the end of the parliamentary term, in November 1927. During the first part of 1928 she joined the newly formed Lenin League (\\"Leninbund\\"). Subsequently, however, she ceased to be politically active. During her final decades she lived in Langen, a small town between Frankfurt (to its north) and Darmstadt (to its south). It was there that Jakob Roth died in 1944. Katharina Roth died in Langen on 3 June 1967.

By 2004 the group had already committed hundreds of acts of vandalism around Honicknowle, as well as serious assault, robbery and sexual offences. They met on a bridge to fight with a copycat group named The Whitleigh Mental Mafia. Disbanding Between 2008-2009 many senior members of the group were charged after an effort by the police to disband the organization, which was reported to be becoming a more sophisticated crime syndicate. The leader, Nathan Danvers, was given a prison sentence in 2008 and others received non-custodial sentences, although many were later incarcerated for separate crimes. The last reported crime attributed to the HDR was in 2011. Legacy No robbery was reported in the area over the whole of 2016.

It incorporates brand language, the terms in which an organisation describes itself and its products, but also covers the names of corporations and the products they sell, taglines, and the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of the brand, defined as the personality and tone discernible in its communications. In conjunction with visual and sensory identity, it is a key component of overall brand identity. Verbal identity has traditionally been considered subordinate to visual identity due to the monodirectional nature of conventional advertising. However, the increasing importance of a two-way conversation between brand and consumer, for instance that of social media, has led to a sharp rise in its prominence over the last decade. This ability to engage in an ongoing dialogue with customers provides an opportunity for companies to more firmly cement their products and services into the consumer consciousness, but doing so successfully requires a consistent, well-defined approach to the use of language. History Verbal Identity was originally defined by John Simmons, a writer and marketing consultant, while working at the brand strategy agency InterBrand John Simmons and Tony Allen, ‚ÄòVisual and verbal identity‚Äô in The Economist: Brands and Branding ed. Rita Clifton, (London: Profile Books 2003), 112. The concept and strategies for its cultivation were developed to address a lack of coherent treatment John Simmons. \\"The Invisible Grail: How Brands Can Use Words to Engage with Audiences\\" (Marshall Cavendish International: 2006) within the advertising, marketing, and branding industries of the language used within brand implementation. The concept of positive verbal identity management has seen a rapid upsurge in popularity since it was first introduced to marketing in 2003. As of 2013, many larger agencies have begun to offer tailored verbal identity services to their clients, with a number of smaller boutique consultancies also emerging to cater for the increasingly high demand. In addition, since the concepts inherent to verbal identity creation and management have always been key skills in copywriting, a number of freelance copywriters have begun to reposition themselves as ‚Äúverbal identity specialists‚Äù. In 2016, the London International Awards introduced a Verbal Identity category where entries were judged upon their naming and tone (linguistics) of voice, among other linguistic qualities. Purpose Verbal identity's primary function is to ensure that the language being used throughout a brand's communication channels is executed in a way which positively impacts the value of the brand. Properly implemented, verbal identity will also inform the language with which the organisation communicates internally. In this way, it will become a vital element of company culture which affects not only consumer perceptions, but the processes through which all aspects of a business are governed and broadcast.John Simmons. \\"The Invisible Grail: How Brands Can Use Words to Engage with Audiences\\" (Marshall Cavendish International: 2006) Development Depending on their history and the circumstances under which they operate, companies may naturally develop a strong verbal brand identity over time. This can regularly occur in organisations which have grown to fit very specific niche markets, for instance technology, or in those situations where a particularly strong leadership exists. Conversely, companies may have trouble maintaining a cohesive verbal identity if they deliver a particularly broad range of products and services, or are extremely large and rely on heavily devolved corporate governance structures. The pre-existence of linguistic associations with the brand in a permanent form on social media outlets over which a brand exercises no control cannot be ignored, because a verbal identity which ignores this material will appear to be inauthentic or out of touchJohn Simmons and Tony Allen. \\"Visual and verbal identity\\" in The Economist: Brands and Branding, ed. Rita Clifton, (London: Profile Books 2003), 114. In developing a verbal-identity strategy, companies should be willing to take stock of the consumer chatter surrounding both their own brand and the industry at large, which in the modern day is principally derived from social media. However, the huge quantities of data these platforms generate has traditionally represented a key barrier to producing worthwhile, in-depth analysis. The application of text analytics programs and techniques are therefore becoming a valuable methodology in the development of such strategies. Once sufficient data has been gathered from appropriate sources, it is necessary for the company to analyse the ways in which their industry speaks to both consumers and other businesses, its own language, and the language used by consumers when speaking of the business and wider industry. With this data available, it is possible to pinpoint the key words and phrases associated with the brand, and their connotations in the wider marketplace. This information can then be used to construct a program for brand implementation through verbal identity, taking into account any current mismatch between brand and consumer language. This will include determining the precise vocabulary to be used in brand communication channels, the optimum names for products and services, and the brand's overall ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. The ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of the brand can be defined as the personality associated with the brand in culture. Depending on what the company wishes to achieve in terms of its verbal identity, the company's voice can be calibrated to take on any style and tone it chooses. The way brands talk to customers is evolving, though, and the conversation needs to change depending on the audience and where it is taking place. =Narrative models= Strong verbal identity is often informed by the narrative models employed in the company's copy. Narrative modelling relies on the assumption that human beings frame their experiences in terms of various classes of ‚Äústory‚Äù, and the notion that people will respond more positively to a story which they can easily recognise and follow. Brands which are struggling to become known within their market can often benefit from a change in narrative model, without any alteration to the product or service. The optimum narrative model for any given brand can only be determined following a full ‚Äúaudit‚Äù of the brand's history and communications. Implementation and delivery The most important aspect of verbal identity implementation is that consistency be maintained across all communication channels, both internal and external. Lack of internal consistency in verbal identity will generally lead to consumer confusion or dissatisfaction with the brand, and may even make a brand appear to be untrustworthy if allowed to go unchecked. Verbal identity is delivered externally through official marketing channels, such as advertising, public relations, and social media. However, it should be evidenced in all situations where a company relies on language to communicate propositions or engage with an audience. This means that when properly implemented and delivered, a company's verbal identity will be reinforced through channels such as phone conversations, sales pitches, and recruitment drives undertaken on behalf of the company. Verbal identity is also delivered internally in any situation in which language is being employed on a day-to-day basis, including presentations and meetings among staff at all levels, as well as company briefs, memos, and other official communications channels. Common Problems Because developing and maintaining a coherent verbal identity across an organisation requires a high degree of unified strategy, a number of problems may be encountered. For example, it will be nearly impossible to implement a sound strategy for verbal identity if communication channels within a business are unclear or disrupted. It will be similarly impossible to make meaningful advances if an analysis of the specific company and sector needs in the area has not been made. Organisations which are particularly fragmented or which rely on heavily devolved structures in their governance will also find verbal identity implementation difficult without clear lines of responsibility and authority.

She was selected by the BBC in 2015 as one of its inspirational 100 Women campaign. Early life Mumtaz Shaikh was born in 1981 in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. Her father, Abu Bakker, was a chauffeur and spoke Malayalam and her mother, Madina spoke the Hindi language. Soon after her birth, the family, which also included an older brother, Rafique, moved to the Vashi Naka neighborhood of the Mumbai suburb, Chembur. When family violence caused Shaikh to be sent to live with an uncle, she worked performing household chores in exchange for shelter, but often went hungry. When she was five and her brother was eight, their father took Rafique to his parents in Kerala and went to work in Dubai. After a difficult childhood of extreme poverty, Shaikh left school after the 9th grade and her uncle arranged a marriage for her when she was fifteen. The marriage was troubled and after the birth of her own daughter at sixteen, Shaikh began secretly attending lectures on family violence in her community provided by social workers from the Committee of Resource Organizations (CORO). Over her husband's objections, she became a volunteer for the organization, soon developing enough confidence to file for divorce. Career Becoming a core team member for CORO in 2000 and selected for a Leader's Quest fellowship in 2005, Mumtaz began mentoring other women in her community. Rising through the organization over the next decade, she became CORO's joint secretary and in 2006 remarried. When CORO created the Mahila Mandal Federation, Mumtaz was made its executive president. As a part of COROs sanitary programs, Mumtaz began addressing issues with public toilets in 2011 and in 2012 led a survey to evaluate safety and conditions at bathroom facilities. In 2013, she began a campaign targeting the issue of unequal access to toilet facilities in Mumbai. Based on a similar campaign, Occupy Men‚Äôs Toilet, from China, 32 non-governmental organizations came together sponsoring a day-long seminar to kick off their effort to increase free access to toilets for women. Mumtaz became the spokesperson for the Right to Pee Campaign, which focused on the fact that though women represent around 50 percent of the workforce in urban areas, they have little access to toilets, unless they can pay. In 2012 in Mumbai, the government provided 5,993 public toilets and 2,466 urinals for men, but only 3,536 facilities for women. Train stations had worse conditions, providing less than 100 urinals and toilets for the 69 stations located on the Central and Harbour Rail Lines. Men paid nothing to use a urinal, but women had to pay to use a toilet. To limit the number of times they urinated, women frequently drank inadequate amounts of water, leading to health complications. The initiative was widely acknowledged, resulting in the government mandating that every 20 kilometers throughout Mumbai, a block of toilets for women were to be constructed. Within one year, pressure from women's organizations had resulted in announcement of 96 new toilet facilities to be built in Mumbai by MCGM. Mumtaz was awarded the title of \\"Daughter of Maharashtra\\" by Nari Samta Manch, Pune and in 2015 was honored by the 100 Women Series of the BBC, as an inspiration. Her dedication to sanitation and the right of women to equality had spread to Sangli and Vidarbha by 2015 and was expanding to address safety in the city. She returned to her education, entering an undergraduate program studying politics, after the birth of her second child. Throughout 2016, Shaikh continued to work on the issue of public toilets, women's safety and health issues caused by the lack of proper facilities and government inaction. She launched plans to extend the program throughout the state of Maharashtra, studying the local needs of various locations.

Teams primarily competes with the similar service Slack, offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage, and application integration. Teams is replacing other Microsoft-operated business messaging and collaboration platforms, including Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom. Microsoft announced Teams at an event in New York, and launched the service worldwide on March 14, 2017. It was created during an internal hackathon at the company headquarters, and is currently led by Microsoft corporate vice president Brian MacDonald.  History  * On August 29, 2007, Microsoft purchased Parlano and its persistent group chat product, MindAlign. * On March 4, 2016, news broke that Microsoft had considered bidding $8 billion for Slack, but that Bill Gates was against the purchase, stating that the firm should instead focus on improving Skype for Business. Qi Lu, EVP of Applications and Services, was leading the push to purchase Slack. After the departure of Lu later that year, Microsoft announced Teams to the public as a direct competitor to Slack on November 2, 2016. * Slack ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times acknowledging the competing service. Though Slack is used by 28 companies in the Fortune 100, The Verge wrote executives will question paying for the service if Teams provides a similar function in their company's existing Office 365 subscription at no added cost. ZDNet reported that the companies were not competing for the same audience, as Teams, at the time, did not let members outside the subscription join the platform, and small businesses and freelancers would have been unlikely to switch. Microsoft has since added this functionality. In response to Teams' announcement, Slack deepened in-product integration with Google services. * On May 3, 2017 Microsoft announced Microsoft Teams would replace Microsoft Classroom in Office 365 Education (formerly known as Office 365 for Education). * On July 12, 2018, Microsoft announced a free version of Microsoft Teams, offering most of the platform's communication options for no charge but limiting the number of users and team file storage capacity. * In January 2019, Microsoft released an update targeting \\"Firstline Workers\\" in order to improve interoperability of Microsoft Teams between different computers for retail workers. * In September 2019, Microsoft announced that Skype for Business would be phased out in favor of Teams; hosted Skype for Business Online was discontinued for new Office 365 customers that month, and will be discontinued entirely on July 31, 2021. * On November 19, 2019, Microsoft announced Microsoft Teams reached 20 million active users. This is an increase from 13 million in July. It announced a \\"Walkie Talkie\\" feature in early 2020 that uses push-to-talk on smartphones and tablets over Wi-Fi or cellular data. The feature was designed for employees who speak with customers or run day-to-day operations. * On March 19, 2020, Microsoft announced Microsoft Teams had hit 44 million daily users, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Microsoft reported that by April 2020, Microsoft Teams had hit 75 million daily users. On a single day in April, it logged 4.1 billion meeting minutes. * On June 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that its acquired video game live streaming service Mixer would shut down in July, and that its staff would be transferred to the Microsoft Teams division.

The Chinese Communist Party commissioned Xu and his wife, Hou Bo, to make an official photographic record to share with the Chinese and world public of Party leaders, scenes of battle, and vignettes of everyday life during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945) and especially of Mao Zedong from the 1930s down to the 1960s. The couple shot many of the best-known photos of Mao and other leaders. Xu was a member of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and President of the Chinese Photographers' Association. Xu Xiaobing, Hou Bo, and Lu Houmin have been called the best photographers of Mao. Early life Xu Xiaobing was born in 1916 in Tongxiang county, Zhejiang, to a family that had declined socially and economically. He was first schooled at home, then, at his grandfather's insistence, sent to a local traditional school, where he studied the Confucian classics. Xu went to Shanghai in 1932 and began his career in the photographic division of the Tianyi Film Company, then in the Mingxing Film Company, though he was not involved in A list films. These studios were known for their careful use of Hollywood cinematographic styles, which Xu studied and absorbed, and Shanghai in the 1930s was also a place where international art and photography flourished. When he lost his position at Mingxing, his friend Wu Weiyun introduced him to a studio in Wuhan, then, when war broke out in 1937, another friend, Wu Yinxian introduced Xu to the Northwest Film Company (Ë•øÂåóÁîµÂΩ±ÂÖ¨Âè∏‰ªªËÅå) in Taiyuan, in the Northwest province of Shanxi.\\"Á∫¢Ëâ≤ÊëÑÂΩ±ÂÆ∂ÂæêËÇñÂÜ∞ (Hongse sheyingjia Xu Xiaobing)(Red photographer Xu Xiaobing Wartime photography at Yan'an Xu, along with other left-wing photographers, such as Cai Shangxiong made his way to the Communist controlled areas outside Xi'an. He joined the communist Eighth Route Army and was assigned to its Yan'an Film Studio (Âª∂ÂÆâÁîµÂΩ±Âà∂ÁâáÂéÇ). He and Wu Yinxian were cinematographers for Yuan Muzhi's Fighting Combine: Nanni Bay, as well as battlefield documentaries of his own. Party leaders as the war with Japan continued became even more eager to establish film studios to make their case both to the Chinese public and world opinion, and Xu was quickly given resources and responsibilities. In the summer of 1938 Xu made his first photo of Mao, taken while the rising leader was addressing a training session on military tactics. Mao Zedong Addresses the Troops The critic-historian Claire Roberts observes that this 1938 photograph of Mao making a speech at Yan'an \\"presaged his leadership of the country\\". She analyzes the message of the photograph by saying that Mao \\"stands in profile to the right of the frame, his hands placed confidently on his hips, towering over a crowd of soldiers\\". This pose, she continues, was an \\"unusual side-on view,\\" in contrast to the traditional way of depicting leaders in a \\"frontal view in order to emphasize their integrity and authority.\\" But Xu explained his choice in a practical way, saying \\"If I had stood in front, I would have had to stand in the middle of the crowd\\", so \\"all I could do was move over to the side and take the shot\\". Peng Dehuai Scouts the Enemy (1940) Xu travelled with the army in Northwest China during campaigns against the Japanese in 1939-1940, where he took candid, on-the-spot photos of battle scenes and everyday life behind the lines. Another historian of Chinese photography adds that at this time there was no \\"personal\\" photography in China, since very few people had cameras, and those few were primarily for official use, such as identification, documentation of government projects and political leaders, and for propaganda. Xu met his future wife, Hou Bo, in Yan'an in early 1942. She was from a poor peasant background, and Xu introduced her to photography. They married in the spring of 1943. According to the austere style of the times, Hou Bo later recalled. \\"About 10 friends gathered with us in our cave; we bought jujubes and dried buns, and we all sang together\\". But the couple was separated for much of the time until January 1949, when the PLA entered Beiping. They were reunited in Mao's summer house in the Fragrant Hills temporary headquarters outside the city, where Xu was photographing Mao's meetings with foreign delegations. Mao took an interest in Hou Bo, and asked her to join the group of official photographers. Xu's assignments from 1943 to 1949 produced widely distributed images. Among them was the arrival in Yan'an of United States Special Envoy Patrick Hurley; the negotiations in Chongqing between the Nationalists and the Communists; the North China campaigns of the Eighth Route Army after 1946; and the arrival of Mao and the People's Liberation Army in Beiping in 1949. After 1949 Xu's wife, Hou Bo, became Mao Zedong's official photographer and the couple lived in the Forbidden City, the residence of top party officials. By one count, although she was the only woman on the film crew, Hou Bo took more than 400 of the officially published phographs of Mao. The couple, in the words of one China watcher, became \\"court phographers\\" who took photos both of Mao in \\"Stalinesque\\" poses that became famous propaganda posters and also relaxed pictures of Mao with his family, some on the beach at Beidaihe. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) the couple was criticized. Jiang Qing, Mao's wife and leader of the radical left wing, charged that Hou \\"never produced any good pictures of Mao\\", and Hou spent several years in prison. The leftists did not approve of Xu's photos of Mao's family life, and did not allow them to be published. After Mao's death and the opening of China, the couple, who had retired nearly a decade earlier, published book collections of their work and arranged their papers.Xu Xiaobing & Hou Bo, ¬ªMao Tsetoung ¬´, 1978 Youtube Video of Xu and Hou's photos of Mao.

A forehead kiss is a sign of adoration and affection. In some Arabic cultures, the forehead kiss is a gesture of apology as well as a sign of acknowledgment of grievance on the part of the person being kissed. Other regions where the forehead kiss has been noted is in Kurdish societies wherein it is usually the older person kissing the younger person on the forehead. Likewise, the forehead kiss is a more acceptable, and subtle, public display of affection. It allows for emotion and passion to be passed from one partner to another, without involving the eyes of those around them like other public displays of affection would. However, it has been argued that the act of kissing a persons forehead is not romantic. Instead such an act is purely neutral and should not be used when trying to transfer feelings of emotion, lust, love, or so on. It's been said to lack certain qualities that make other kisses more romantic and therefore should not be thought of as a gesture for expressing non- platonic love. It is even stated that the kiss is used as a means of imposing distance in certain situations.  Use in media  The forehead kiss has been used in many different forms of media. In the film medium, the forehead kiss exists in horror, comedy, science thriller, and other genres. Likewise, if someone is in search of a meaningful quote regarding forehead kisses and what they can represent, searching on Pinterest will reveal a myriad of choices; all of which, seem to tackle a different sector of the forehead kiss. In its use here, sector is referring to the different meanings the kiss can have, like friendship, love, and non-sexual attachment.

Early life and career Born in Pisa in 1888, Gino Pavesi entered the Naval Academy in Livorno in 1906, graduating as an ensign in 1909.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina 1861-1946. In 1911-1912 Pavesi participated in the Italo-Turkish War with the rank of sub-lieutenant, on board the armored cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi. During World War I he served on battleships (including Ammiraglio di Saint Bon) and destroyers (including Antonio Mosto). Between 1925 and 1926, with the rank of lieutenant commander, he served as the executive officer of the light cruiser Ancona; after promotion to commander, between 1926 and 1927 he commanded the destroyers Enrico Cosenz and Cesare Battisti. Between 1933 and 1935, after promotion to Captain, he commanded the destroyers Antonio Pigafetta and Lanzerotto Malocello and their Squadron; between 1936 and 1937 he served as the commanding officer of the light cruiser Luigi Cadorna. He also held shore assignments, mainly at High Command of the Royal Naval Crews Corps (Corpo dei Regi Equipaggi Marittimi, C.R.E.M.) in the Ministry of the Navy.  World War II  After promotion to rear admiral in January 1940, Pavesi was serving at the Inspectorate for preparation and testing of new ships when Italy entered World War II (June 10, 1940); in February 1941 he became inspector of schools under the C.R.E.M. High Command, of which in November 1941 he became himself the commander. He was promoted to vice admiral in September 1942, and appointed commander of the Pantelleria Naval Area in March 1943. The island of Pantelleria was a heavily fortified stronghold, with an airport in cave (where 60 fighter aircraft were based), sheltered from air strikes, eight anti-ship batteries (overall twelve 152 mm guns, thirteen 120 mm guns, and twelve 90 mm guns) and 14 anti-aircraft batteries, with a total of seventy-six 76 mm guns.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta, 1940-1943, pp. 394-395-396. The island had a garrison of 11,420 men, mostly in defensive positions located in caves; the food reserves, according to some sources, could last for 20, 30 or 50 days.Mauro Gioannini, Giulio Massobrio, Bombardate l'Italia. Storia della guerra di distruzione aerea 1940-1945 , pp. 298 to 305. The fortification works, however, were not yet completed at the time of Italy's entry into the war, and during the following three years they had progressed at a slow pace; consequently, the island's defenses had several weaknesses: although the main ammunition depot was also located in a cave, ammunition had to be distributed to the batteries via exposed roads; three wells with electrically operated pumps were to ensure water autonomy of Pantelleria, but the power plant was not complete (therefore the island's resistance depended on water supplies sent from Italy), and only a few tank trucks were available for the distribution of water on the island; because of the high costs, the planned cave emplacements for the artillery had not yet been realized, so that all the batteries were in the open, and so were the phone lines, which were therefore highly vulnerable; there were neither underwater and permanent obstacles nor minefields.L‚ÄôItalia della disfatta With the surrender of the Axis forces in Tunisia, in May 1943, Pantelleria found itself at the forefront; but the civilian population, which numbered more than 10,000, was not evacuated and found itself with no air-raid shelters (therefore having to use the same shelters as the garrison). The capture of Pantelleria and the Pelagian Islands, although not critical to the planned invasion of Sicily, could be very useful for the Allies because it would provide another airport in addition the already overcrowded ones in Malta, in addition to eliminating an Italian outpost that could still be a source of disturbance. Operation Corkscrew started on May 8, 1943: from that day, for over a month, the island was subjected to continuous air strikes by about 1,500 British and American aircraft, in order to annihilate its defenses and the morale of the garrison, in preparation of an Allied landing; 6,202 tons of bombs were dropped over the island, of which 4,705 tons were dropped from 7 to 11 June. Two naval bombardments were also carried out on 8 and 11 June; ships of the Royal Navy also enforced a blockade in the waters around the island, although this did not entirely prevent the arrival of supplies sent at night with motor barges and other small vessels. The air raids disrupted communications and road network, making the distribution of food and water extremely difficult, put out of the power plant and destroyed part of the artillery positions (but still on the evening of June 9, 48% of anti-aircraft batteries and 80% of anti-ship batteries were functional). Casualties among the garrison and the civilian population were very limited (about forty killed and less than 150 wounded among the garrison, 4 or 5 dead and 6 wounded among the civilian population), thanks to the wide availability of cave shelters, but the morale was severely undermined by the uninterrupted airstrikes and sleep deprivation in the last days. A call to surrender was sent by the Allies on June 10, but Pavesi did not answer (as he had already done a few days before); on the following day, a flotilla of about fifty British landing craft and other vessels, carrying about 14,000 men, showed up off Pantelleria.Springboard to Berlin At 3:55 on June 11 Pavesi asked Supermarina (the naval headquarters in Rome) for permission to surrender; the request was brought to Benito Mussolini, who - after a consultation with Supermarina and the Supreme Command - decided to authorize it, ordering that the signal of surrender was broadcast at noon of that day, and the yield was to be motivated with the lack of water. Admiral Pavesi, however, did not wait for the permission of Rome, and announced his surrender at 11:00. Pavesi was interned in a POW camp in the United Kingdom, and was repatriated in November 1944. Meanwhile, in Italy, the admiral was the subject of harsh criticism - especially in the ranks of the fascist regime, and even more, later, in those of Republic of Sal√≤ - who accused him of not having opposed the necessary resistance to the Allies, \\"as the laws of duty and of honor compelled him\\", if not openly of treason. In May 1944 he was tried and sentenced to death in absentia by a Fascist court in Parma. Pavesi's decision was justified by many by the fact that a resistance to the bitter end would have only resulted in a massacre of the garrison and the civilian population of Pantelleria, without delaying the Allies' plans by more than a few days. More criticism concerned the decision not to order, before the surrender, the destruction of depots, hangars and other military installations on the island, so that they fell intact into enemy hands. Pavesi resumed service in 1945, at the disposal of the Naval General Staff; in 1946-1947 he was general director of the Naval Crew Corps, then he was assigned to the General Staff for special assignments. He was placed in reserve in 1948 after reaching the age limit, and he was promoted to full admiral in the reserve in 1957. He died in Rome on February 3, 1960.

Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He became the 14th Prime Minister of Republic of India. His first cabinet consisted of 45 ministers, 25 fewer than the previous UPA government. 21 new ministers were added to the council of ministers in November 2014. His current cabinet has a strength of 54 ministers.  Economic policies  The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labor laws, to make it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt laborers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1% to 3% over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5%, making it the fastest growing large economy. For this the basis was a revised formula introduced a year after he took office, which surprised a lot of economists. However, this rate of growth had fallen significantly to 6.1%, even by the revised metric, by his third year in office. This fall has been blamed on the exercise of demonetisation of currency. The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programs and social welfare measures was greatly decreased by the Modi administration. The money spent on social programs declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi's first year in office. Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education, by 16%. The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the \\"education for all\\" program, declined by 22%. The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, and reduced customs duties on gold, jewelry, and increased sales taxes. In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices, and later increased taxes on diesel and petrol. In July 2014, Modi refused to sign a trade agreement that would permit the World Trade Organization to implement a deal agreed in Bali, citing a lack of protection to Indian farmers and the needs of food security. The addition to Indian airports grew by 23 percent in 2016 while the airfares dropped by over 25 percent. Modi at the launch of the Make in India program. In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning India into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. The government substantially increased the percentage of central revenue directly granted to states, while decreasing the amount granted through various central government programs. Overall, states' share of revenue increased marginally. The criteria upon which individual states' allocation was determined were changed, such that the revenue to 19 states increased, and that of 10 states decreased. Only one of the ten states was ruled by the BJP when the policy was enacted. The government signed large deals with General Electric and Alstom to supply India with 1,000 new diesel locomotives, as part of an effort to reform the Indian railway, which also included privatisation efforts. In December 2015, Modi's government signed an agreement with Japan to jointly build a bullet train system linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The Indian government put forward a plan on converting 101 rivers into national waterways for the transport of goods and passengers. The government also began an ambitious program to increase the number of highways in the country, allocating to the project. On 25 June 2015, Modi launched a program intended to develop 100 smart cities. The \\"Smart Cities\\" program is expected to bring IT companies an extra benefit of . He also launched a \\"smart villages\\" initiative, under which villages would be given Internet access, clean water, sanitation, and low-carbon energy, with Members of Parliament overseeing the program's implementation. The program had a stated goal of at least 2,500 smart villages by 2019. Give up LPG subsidy is a campaign launched in March 2015 by the Indian government led by Narendra Modi. It is aimed at motivating LPG users who can afford to pay the market price for LPG to voluntarily surrender their LPG subsidy. As at 23 April 2016 1 crore ( 10 million) people had voluntarily given up the subsidy. The surrendered subsidy is being used by the government to provide cooking gas connections to poor families in rural households free of cost. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and Tamil Nadu are the top five states to give up the subsidy. In his regime Railway budget was merged into the Union Budget of India. The date of presenting budget was moved from 28 to 1 February and financial cycle was changed from July to April. Further, the artificial distinction between planned and non-planned expenditure was removed. Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), considered as a hurdle in FDI, was scrapped by Modi government. Modi government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017. =Financial inclusion= Modi launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2014. The initiative aimed to create bank accounts and debit cards for 150 million families, and to allow them an overdraft of and accident insurance. After the launch, 125.4 million accounts were opened by January 2015. Mudra yojna logo Modi government launched the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) in April 2015. Under this scheme, loans up to are given for non-agricultural activities under the three categories: Shishu (loans up to ); Kishore (loans from to ) and Tarun (loans from to ). According to a report by the SKOCH Group, this scheme has generated 1.68 crore incremental jobs in the first two years until September 2017. =Anti-corruption initiatives= In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money. Demonetisation On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects on a number of small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. As a combined effect of Modi's announcement and the US presidential election results, thindices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. The decision met with mixed initial reactions. Several bankers like Arundhati Bhattacharya (Chairperson of State Bank of India) and Chanda Kochhar (MD & CEO of ICICI Bank) appreciated the move in the sense that it would help curb black money. Businessmen Anand Mahindra (Mahindra Group), Sajjan Jindal (JSW Group), Kunal Bahl (Snapdeal and FreeCharge) also supported the move adding that it would also accelerate e-commerce. Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy praised the move. Former Chief Election Commissioner of India S. Y. Quraishi said demonetisation could lead to long term electoral reforms. Indian social activist Anna Hazare hailed demonetisation as a revolutionary step. The President of India Pranab Mukherjee welcomed the demonetisation move by calling it bold step. The opinion of the masses varied both ways on micro- blogs and social media sites like Twitter. By and large, international response was positive which saw the move as a bold crackdown on corruption. International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a statement supporting Modi's efforts to fight corruption by the demonetisation policy. Chinese state media Global Times praised the move and termed it as \\"fierce fight against black money and corruption.\\" Former Prime Minister of Finland and Vice-President of European Commission Jyrki Katainen welcomed the demonetisation move stressing that bringing transparency will strengthen Indian economy. BBC's South Asia Correspondent Justin Rowlatt in his article praised the move for its secrecy and success and elaborated on reason behind demonetisation.Tim Worstall termed the demonetisation as welcome macroeconomic effect in his article in Forbes magazine. Swedish Minister of Enterprise Mikael Damberg supported the move by calling it bold decision.  Shell companies  After demonetisation of ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ1000 rupee notes various authorities noticed a surge in shell companies depositing cash in banks, possibly in an attempt to hide the real owner of the wealth. In response, in July 2017, the authorities ordered nearly 2 lakh shell companies to be shut down while Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed trading restrictions on 162 listed entities as shell companies. In September 2017, the government froze bank accounts of nearly 2 lakh shell companies. A day after, the Corporate Affairs ministry decided to: ban around 300,000 directors of shell companies from serving on the boards of other firms, track down the beneficial owners of suspected shell companies and take penal action against those who divert funds from these shell companies. =Infrastructure= Modi government passed the National Waterways Act, 2016 to develop 111 National Waterways in India. Hindutva and social policies During the 2014 election campaign, Modi expressed hopes for a tenure without communal violence. The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia. The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva, however, by BJP leaders in certain states. Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India. A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto. Several state governments headed by the BJP have enacted policies aligned with Hindutva after the election of Modi as prime minister. The government of Maharashtra banned the killing of cows in 2014. The government of Haryana made changes to its education policy that introduced Hindu religious elements into the curriculum. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj suggested after the election that the Bhagvad Gita be adopted as India's \\"national book\\". The Modi administration has generally avoided directly supporting policies related to a Hindutva agenda. There has been an increase in the activities of a number of other Hindu nationalist organisations, sometimes with the support of the government. The incidents included a campaign against \\"Love Jihad\\", a religious conversion programme, and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing Hindu Mahasabha. The attempts at religious conversion have been described by the VHP and other organisations involved with them as attempts at \\"reconversion\\" from Islam or Christianity. There have been a number of reports of intimidation or coercion of the subjects during these attempts. Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, have defended the attempts. There were additional incidents of violence targeted at religious minorities by Hindu nationalists. Modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as \\"bastards.\\" Commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical Hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of Modi. The Modi administration appointed Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research. In reaction to his appointment, other historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the ruling party, questioned his credentials as a historian. Several stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism. The government began formulating a New Education Policy, or NEP, soon after its election. As of March 2016, this policy had yet to be implemented. This was the third education policy introduced by the Indian government, following those of 1968 and 1986. The policy was described as having overtones of Hindutva. The RSS had a role in its creation, and it did not explicitly mention the goals of \\"socialism, secularism and democracy\\" that had been mentioned in the first two policies. The policy emphasized the education of minority students, as well as those of economically backward groups, in particular on improving enrollment in schools among those groups. The policy proposed bringing religious educational institutions under the Right to Education Act. There was also a debate about removing caste-based reservation in favor of reservation based on income, a move supported by the RSS, but which was criticized as being discriminatory on the basis of caste. On 8 January 2019, India's lower house of parliament approves a bill that would grant residency and citizenship rights to non-Muslim immigrants Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from three Muslim-majority countries - Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan - eligible for Indian citizenship. the Bill excludes Muslims.India's lower house passes citizenship bill that excludes Muslims  India News  Al JazeeraThe new citizenship bill and the Hinduisation of India  Human Rights  Al Jazeera =Social welfare= In June 2015, Modi launched the \\"Housing for All By 2022\\" project, which intends to eliminate slums in India by building about 20 million affordable homes for India's urban poor. A total of 4,718 camps were held from 2014‚Äì2017, benefiting 6.40 lakh beneficiaries under Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids/Appliances (ADIP) scheme, as compared to 37 camps from 2012‚Äì14. In 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to Economically weaker sections. Modi also launched Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) on 1 May 2016 to distribute 50 million LPG connections to women of BPL families. A budgetary allocation of was made for the scheme. In the first year of its launch, the connections distributed were 22 million against the target of 15 million. As of 23 October 2017, 30 million connections were distributed, 44% of which were given to families belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The number crossed 58 million by December 2018. In 2018 Union Budget of India, its scope was widened to include 80 million poor households. 21,000 awareness camps were conducted by oil marketing companies (OMC). The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014. =The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017= The BJP Government formulated the bill after 100 cases of instant triple talaq in the country since the Supreme Court judgement in August 2017. On 28 December 2017, Lok Sabha passed The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017. The bill make instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddah) in any form ‚Äî spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as email, SMS and WhatsApp illegal and void, with up to three years in jail for the husband. MPs from RJD, AIMIM, BJD, AIADMK and AIML opposed the bill, calling it arbitrary in nature and a faulty proposal, while Congress supported the Bill tabled in Lok Sabha by law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. 19 amendments were moved in Lok Sabha but all were rejected. The government introduced a fresh The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 bill in the lok sabha on 21 June 2019. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 25 July 2019 and then by Rajya Sabha on 30 July 2019 and got assent from president Kovind on 31 July 2019.  Health and sanitation policies  In his first year as prime minister Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the government on healthcare. The Modi government launched a \\"New Health Policy\\" in January 2015. The policy did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, but placed emphasis on the role of private healthcare organisations. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programs to support public health goals including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The National Health Mission, which included public health programs targeted at these indices received nearly 25% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programs, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission, and received less funds than in previous years. Modi initially appointed Harsh Vardhan, a doctor and an advocate of tobacco control, minister of health. However, Vardhan was removed in November 2015. The government also proposed introducing stricter packaging laws for tobacco, but this effort was postponed because of the efforts of the tobacco lobby. On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (\\"Clean India\\") campaign. The states goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation, eliminating manual scavenging, and improving waste management practices. The campaign was announced on the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, and was planned to achieve these aims in five years, or in time for the 150th anniversary of his birth. As part of the programme, the Indian government began the construction of millions toilets in rural areas, as well as efforts to encourage people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them. Modi has generally emphasized his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. He has also advocated yoga and traditional forms of medicine. An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country \\"might have taken a few steps back in public health\\" under Modi. Modi's government developed a draft policy to introduce a universal health care system, known as the National Health Assurance Mission. Under this plan, the government was to provide free drugs, diagnostic treatment, and insurance coverage for serious ailments, although budgetary concerns have delayed its implementation. The government announced \\"Ayushman Bharat\\" (National Health Protection Mission) in the 2018 Union Budget of India. It is World's largest health protection scheme, also being called ModiCare. The scheme will help 10 crore families in their medical need. Under the Ayushman Bharat programme, there is a new scheme has been announced by Arun Jaitley, the finance minister of India, called National Health Protection Scheme, providing a health insurance cover of ‚Çπ5 lac a family per annum. More than a lakh people have taken benefit of the scheme till October 2018. Education and skill development Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), a skill development initiative scheme of the Government of India for recognition and standardisation of skills. Cabinet approved an outlay of for the project. The scheme has a target to train 1 crore Indian youth from 2016‚Äì20. As of 18 July 2016, 17.93 lakh candidates were trained out of 18 lakh who enrolled for the scheme. The aim of the PMKVY scheme is to encourage aptitude towards employable skills and to increase working efficiency of probable and existing daily wage earners, by giving monetary awards and rewards and by providing quality training to them. Average award amount per person has been kept as . Those wage earners already possessing a standard level of skill will be given recognition as per scheme and average award amount for them is ‚Çπ2000 to ‚Çπ2500. In the initial year, a target to distribute has been laid down for the scheme. Training programmes have been worked out on the basis of National Occupational Standards (NOS) and qualification packs specifically developed in various sectors of skills. For this qualification plans and quality plans have been developed by various Sector Skill Councils (SSC) created with participation of Industries. National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) has been made coordinating and driving agency for the same. An outlay of has been approved by the cabinet for this project. The scheme has a target to train 1 crore Indian youth from 2016‚Äì20. As of 18 July 2016, 17.93 lakh candidates were trained out of 18 lakh who enrolled for the scheme. The government began formulating a New Education Policy, or NEP, soon after its election. This was the third education policy introduced by the Indian government, following those of 1968 and 1986. The policy was described as having overtones of Hindutva. The RSS had a role in its creation, and it did not explicitly mention the goals of \\"socialism, secularism and democracy\\" that had been mentioned in the first two policies. The policy emphasised the education of minority students, as well as those of economically backward groups, in particular on improving enrolment in schools among those groups. The policy proposed bringing religious educational institutions under the Right to Education Act. There was also a debate about removing caste-based reservation in favour of reservation based on income, a move supported by the RSS, but which was criticised as being discriminatory on the basis of caste. As of October 2018, the new policy had not been implemented.  Foreign policy  Temer, Modi, Xi, Putin and Zuma. Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi's election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto. Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to the ceremony where he was sworn in as prime minister. He was the first Indian prime minister to do so. Observers have stated that due to Modi portraying himself as a strong and nationalist leader during his election campaign, he would be politically unable to follow a policy of restraint that India had previously followed after terrorist attacks, and is more likely to have a military response. Modi's foreign policy focused on improving economic ties, improving security, and increased regional relations, which is very similar to the policy of the preceding INC government. Modi continued his predecessor Manmohan Singh's policy of \\"multialignment.\\" This involved the use of regional multilateral institutions and strategic partnerships to further the interests of the Indian government. The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia. The Modi government also upgraded several of India's military alliances, although it was unable to conclude negotiations for a trilateral defense agreement with Japan and Australia. As a part of this policy, the Modi government completed India's application to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is led by China and Russia. (SCO). It also joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank founded by China. Together with the US government, it created a \\"Joint Strategic Vision\\" for the Indian and Pacific oceans. The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic republics in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel, with the intent to also \\"link west.\\" Modi added five bilateral strategic partnerships to the 25 that had been agreed by his predecessors Singh and Vajpayee. During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. During these visits, Modi attempted to draw further foreign investment in the Indian economy, with the use of slogans such as \\"Make in India\\" and \\"Digital India,\\" put forward during a visit to Silicon Valley. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Another early visit was to Bhutan. IModi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. As of July 2016, Modi had made 51 trips to 42 countries with the intent of strengthening diplomatic relations. In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the India‚ÄìBangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh. Modi's administration gave renewed attention to India's \\"Look East Policy\\", instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the \\"Act East Policy\\", and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia. The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar, through the state of Manipur. This represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritized border security over trade. He coined the concept of \\"three Ds\\" ‚Äî democracy, demography and demand ‚Äî to reflect the strength of the country.  Defence policy  During the 2014 election campaign, Modi and the BJP pledged to revisit India's nuclear weapons doctrine, and in particular India's historical policy of no-first-use. The pressure to revise the doctrine came from a desire for assertiveness among Indian government and defence officials. Soon after being sworn in as Prime Minister, Modi said that no revision would take place in the immediate future. The election manifesto of the BJP had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. During the election campaign, Modi said that he would be willing to accommodate Hindu migrants who were being persecuted in Bangladesh, but those that came with \\"political objectives\\" would have to be sent back to Bangladesh. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalize their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons. However, it drew criticism from several Assamese organizations. Modi continued the previous INC administration's policy of increasing military spending every year, announcing an increase of 11% in the military budget in 2015. This increase was larger than the average growth under the Congress. The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people. The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organization. Modi has repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an exporter of terrorism. Modi increased the monetary compensation for victims of terrorist attacks, and stated that citizens of Azad Kashmir could also apply for this compensation. In September 2016, he urged the BRICS to target and destroy funding channels of terrorist groups. On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in PoK, Pakistan denied the claim which they always do. The details of the confrontation were later released by the Indian Army. Video footages were released of the confrontations. Environmental policies Modi(right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015. In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the \\"Ministry of Environment and Forests\\" the \\"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\\" In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%. The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the National Board for Wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received. The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme court. Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. The changes were made with the aim of accelerating approval for industrial projects. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by business people, but were criticized by environmentalists. Under the UPA government that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of Genetically Modified crops had essentially put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops. At the CoP21 Climate Conference on 30 November 2015 Modi announced the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). The headquarters of the ISA would be located in Gurgaon, and would receive support from the Indian government for a few years. All tropical countries were invited to join the alliance. He was also awarded the United Nations Champions of the Earth award in 2018 for his environmental policies. Governance and other initiatives Modi's first year as prime minister saw significant centralization of power relative to previous administrations. Modi personally selected the civil servants who served under his ministers, frequently giving them instructions without involving the ministers themselves. Modi's efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policied frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances, or executive orders, to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Office prevented Gopal Subramaniam from being appointed to the Supreme Court. The stated reason was that his conduct in the 2G spectrum allocation case had been suspect: commentators stated it was because he had been the amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, which had implicated BJP leaders including Modi's aide Amit Shah. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary. On 31 December 2014, Modi announced that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was a legacy of the Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The new body includes the leaders of all 29 Indian states, but its full-time staff report directly to the prime minister. The move had the effect of greatly centralizing the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice. As Prime Minister, Modi announced the abolition of a number of regulations previously placed on Indian businesses, such as a complex permit and inspection system. The move was aimed at reducing red tape and making it easier to do business. Modi also ordered reform among the bureaucrats of the Indian Administrative Service to ensure a more efficient government bureaucracy. The Modi government launched a crackdown against a number of civil society organisations. Several tens of thousands of organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau in the first year of the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent with Modi's style of functioning within the BJP, and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi. He started a monthly radio program titled \\"Mann ki Baat\\" on 3 October 2014. =Repealing obsolete laws= Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister, against a total of 1,301 such laws repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years. The legislations passed in the parliament for the purpose include Repealing and Amending Act, 2015, Repealing and Amending (Second) Act, 2015, Repealing and Amending Act, 2016, Repealing and Amending Act, 2017 and Repealing and Amending (Second) Act, 2017. =IT policy= Modi launched the Digital India programme, which has the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure so rural areas get high-speed Internet access, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy. Under the programme, 400 railway Stations across the country are being equipped with Wi- Fi technology. In the 2017 Union Budget of India, POS machines, scanners, fingerprint readers, iris scanners and micro ATMs were exempted from all kinds of custom duties. The internet penetration in India rose from 20 percent in 2014 to 28.7 percent in 2016. =Partnerships= \\"Unnat Bharat Abhiyan\\" involve engaging with neighbouring communities and using technologies for their upliftment.IITs, others to develop technologies for rural developmentIITs to adopt ten villagesIITs to adopt ten villages References =Citations= =Sources= * External links Narendra Modi Indian premierships Modi administration ","title":"Premiership of Narendra Modi"},{"id":"52507148","text":"The Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus of the 13th convocation was the Belarusian parliament elected in 1995.

The stems are scantily branched, square and usually hairless, although new growth sometimes has a few hairs along the angles. The leaves are opposite, about long and wide, ovate or broadly lanceolate, with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short petioles and the upper leaves are appressed against the stem. The upper surface of the leafblades are often pubescent, yellowish-green or green, sometimes with purple spotting or tingeing at the margin. The uppermost leaves form bracts subtending the blooms. The flowerheads are about wide, cone-shaped at first and flattening out later, with the central florets opening first. The calyx of each floret is tubular and hairy, with five pointed lobes. The florets are white or pink, curved, about long, with a narrow tube and upper lip and a slightly wider lower lip speckled with purple. The flowers usually bloom in late spring and early summer. The seed is a nutlet that can be dispersed by the wind, and the plant can also spread by vegetative growth from rhizomes. Distribution and habitat Monarda bradburiana is native to central and southeastern United States where it is found in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Its typical habitat is thickets, woodland edges, grassland and roadsides. Ecology The flowers of Monarda bradburiana produce copious quantities of nectar and are attractive to bumblebees and other long-tongued bees, butterflies, hummingbird moths, beeflies and hummingbirds. Pollen is harvested by halictid bees which cannot reach the nectar, and a specialist pollinator is Doufourea monardae, a small black bee. This is a food plant for the caterpillars of the hermit sphinx, the gray marvel, the orange mint moth and the raspberry pyrausta moth. Herbivorous mammals tend to avoid the foliage, perhaps because it has an odour of oregano.

Early life  Henry Lewis Bullen was born in 1857 in Ballarat, Australia to American-Scotch parentage. He left school at 14 to become a printers apprentice and began writing articles for trade publications. In 1875, he immigrated to the United States. He lived for ten years in Boston where he worked as a printer, later becoming the editor of Trade Review, a printers publication, and made frequent visits to New York City to study new printing technologies.  Career  In 1891, Bullen moved to New York City to work as the advertising manager for Hamilton Manufacturing Company, a printers supplier, who later became part of The American Type Founders' Company (ATF). Bullen experienced calamity in 1905, when he left to work at the United Printing Machinery Company. He rapidly fell out with his employer and was demoted, and then disappeared with $2750 of company money, being arrested by Pinkerton detectives with a ticket to Honolulu. He was sentenced to two years in prison (reduced from ten as a first offence). Bullen's friend Herbert Bingham suggested that he had experienced a breakdown due to overwork. Robert Nelson of ATF took pity on him and he returned to ATF in 1908. Bullen became ATF's advertising manager and informal corporate historian, he was responsible for producing type specimen books, machinery and material catalogs and pamphlets. He also successfully marketed the concept of \\"type families,\\" offering further weights than roman and italic and introduced classic revivals of Garamond, Caslon, Cloister, and Bodoni. He was also a contributor to The Inland Printer. At ATF, Bullen began expanding his personal collection that would become the foundation for the ATF Library in 1908 in Jersey City. The ATF Library was \\"to serve as a model of art and craftsmanship to students of typography...to memorialize or honor predecessors in our profession or printers now living...[and to] enhance the appreciation by the general public of printing as an art and influence.\\" The ATF Library merged the collections of Theodore Low De Vinne, Typothethae of the City of New York and the Franklin Typographic Society along with numerous smaller collections. Bullen served as librarian and was responsible for over 16,000 documents at its peak. In 1923, he advertised help at the library while compiling the 1923 type specimen book, hiring Beatrice Warde as assistant librarian. He later retired that year, and traveled to Europe to acquire rare books for the library. After ATF declared bankruptcy in 1933, Bullen began talks with Columbia University to acquire the library as he felt that the library housed at the University would provide the greatest research value to the public. The ATF Library was moved to Columbia University in 1936 and opened to the public in 1939. The University officially purchased the collection in 1941. Bullen also lectured on graphic arts, wrote about typography, and curated exhibitions on typography. Contemporary amateur historian of printing David M. Macmillan however has expressed concern that his writing was often inaccurate: \\"I have come to the point where I find it impossible to rely upon anything that he said which does not have external corroboration.\\" Beatrice Warde later in life said he had suppressed suspicions that the \\"Garamond\\" type his company was reviving was not really the work of sixteenth-century engraver Claude Garamond, noting that he had never been able to find a sixteenth-century book that contained it; Warde discovered a few years later that it had actually been cut by the little-known Jean Jannon in the following century. In 1911, he helped to found the Printers Apprentices of New York, which became a part of the New York School of Printing. He was awarded the AIGA Medal in 1934.  Death  Bullen died on April 27, 1938 in Elmhurst, Queens.

In August 1916 he briefly commanded the 195th Infantry Division and was promoted to Generalleutnant. He was assigned to lead the newly created Cavalry Corps Schmettow as part of the 9th Army during the Romanian campaign. It initially consisted of the remnants of the 3rd Cavalry Division, the 1st Austrian Cavalry Division and the 51st Hungarian Honved Infantry Division. For his services in the campaign Schmettow received the Pour le Merite. In early 1917 Schmettow and his corps were transferred to the Western Front and made up of the 6th and 7th Cavalry Divisions. Shortly afterwards the corps changed, dismounting and exchanging most of the mounted units as cavalry was less needed, and was renamed 65th Corps or Gendkdo z.b.V. 65 (\\"General Command for Special Use\\"). Schmettow fought in the 2nd and the 3rd Battle of the Aisne. Close to the end of the war the corps, by now consisting of the 5th, 50th and 216th Infantry Divisions as well as the 4th Guards Infantry Division, participated in the Second Battle of the Marne. For his services in the later Schmettow received the oak leaves to his Pour le Merite. After the armistice General von Schmettow resigned his commission and ended his military service on 22 February 1919; passing away in G√∂rlitz on 21 January 1935. Family He was married to Agnes von Rundstedt - sister of the famous Wehrmacht Field Marshall - and had three daughters and two sons. Eberhard also was a cousin of contemporary and fellow cavalry general Egon Graf von Schmettow. One of his sons, Leutnant Maximilian von Schmettow, fell at Cunel in 1918. His other son, Rudolf von Schmettow, served in his father's regiment and later became a general-leutnant in the Wehrmacht. He commanded German troops in the Channel Islands, where his honourable, chivalrous and sensible influence was eventually recognised as key to the relative absence of extremism and oppression during the occupation.

Early life and education Born in Rheydt, Germany, Johann Wilhelm Preyer grew up in the old town area of Eschweiler. His father was a merchant. He had a sister, Louise, and a brother Gustav, who was also a painter. Both he and his brother were very small-statured, and in his youth Preyer occasionally took advantage of this by dressing as a child to play pranks. Beginning in 1882, Preyer studied art at the D√ºsseldorf Art Academy with Peter von Cornelius and became a master student of Wilhelm von Schadow. He continued his studies in the Netherlands, Munich, northern Italy, and Switzerland between 1835 and 1843. He returned to D√ºsseldorf in 1844. Johann Wilhelm Preyer, Fruit and a Goblet, 1854 Johann Wilhelm Preyer, Garden Bouquet in a Pitcher, 1831 Preyer's wife Emilie, painted by Johann Peter Hasenclever 1842. Art career Preyer painted mainly still lifes of flowers and fruit, and is today considered one of best artists in the genre in the 19th century, known for his minute and careful detail work. He is also one of the earliest of the group now known as the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. Much of his work is in the United States, although there are representative works in the Berlin National Gallery and elsewhere in Germany. Preyer was one of the founding members of the Association of D√ºsseldorf Artists (1844). He occasionally took private students, one of whom was the American still life painter Helen Searle. Family Around 1844, Preyer married Emilie Lachenwitz, the sister of painter Siegmund Lachenwitz. They had a daughter, also named Emilie, and a son, Paul, both of whom also became painters. Honors A road in Eschweiler, where Preyer grew up, was renamed Preyerstrasse in his honor in 1974.

He was the son of Christopher I, Burgrave and Count of Dohna-Schlodien (1665-1733). He served in the armies of Frederick William I of Prussia and his son, Frederick II, in the Silesian and Seven Years' wars. He was particularly successful at the Battle of Gross-J√§gersdorf, and instrumental in relieving Siege of Kolberg. Family Christoph II descended from an old Prussian family, von Dohna, whose founder was Stanislaus von Dohna (1433-1504); his father, Christoph I. zu Dohna-Schlodien, was Stanislaus's great-grandson. His mother, Frede (Friederike) Marie (1660 -1729, Danzig), was the daughter of his uncle, Christian Albert, Burgrave and Count of Dohna. Christoph II married in Wildenfels on 18 October 1734 to Gr√§fin Friederike zu Solms-Wildenfels (28 Mai 1714 - 9 April 1755). She was the daughter of Friedrich Christoph zu Solms- Wildenfels (1712-1792). In April 1741 and in December 1742, the couple had daughters Sophia Albertine and Albertina Amalia.Johann Samuel Heinsius, Genealogisch-historische Nachrichten von den vornehmsten, Berlin, 1746, p. 300, In 1747, when the couple had a daughter, the Princess Amalia and two younger brothers stood in for the King at the child's baptism.Johann Samuel Heinsius, Genealogisch-historische (en Fortgesetzte neue geneal. hist.

Many of the Junkers owned immense estates, especially in the north-eastern part of Prussia (i.e. the Prussian provinces of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, East Prussia and Posen). Their younger sons followed careers as soldiers (Fahnenjunker); consequently, the links between the Junker families to the Prussian Army firmly united the Prussian elite with the Prussian state.William W.

New York: Free Press, 1966 , p 3. On 20 June 1745, Dohna was appointed major general by patent effective as of 15 May 1743. He became proprietor of Infantry Regiment Nr. 4 in 1745; this regiment, established in 1672, had been his father's and grandfather's during their military service.G√ºnther Gieraths, Die Kampfhandlungen der brandenburgisch-preussischen Armee, 1626-1800, Walter de Gruyter, 1964 p. 15. He later became the proprietor of Infantry Regiment Nr. 23 until 1748; on 14 July 1748, he became proprietor of Infantry Regiment No. 16, which had been established by his grandfather in 1689,Gieraths, p. 57. and at which he remained until his death in 1762.Christopher Duffy, The Army of Frederick the Great, New York, Hippocrene Books, 1974 , p. 239. On 25 January 1751, Frederick promoted him to lieutenant general. Dohna distinguished himself in the war against Austria, and subsequently in the first two of Frederick's three Silesian Wars. In 1751, he commanded the advanced guard of Hans von Lehwaldt's Corps against the Russians at the first battle of Gro√ü-J√§gersdorf, where he was wounded. Dohna was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle in 1753 and also promoted to lieutenant general in January of that year. After a brief interval of peace, in April 1758 he received the command of Prussia's troops in the Pomeranian Theater, fighting against the Swedes at Stralsund. Sweden's ally, Russia, sent an army to relieve the blockade, which Dohna held at bay with his small force until the Frederick's arrival with the main army at the Oder; Christoph II subsequently commanded a wing--22,000 strong--of the Prussian force at the first meeting at the Zorndorf, an arguably strategic victory for the Prussians but one at which they suffered high losses.A Hook. Zorndorf 1758: Frederick Faces Holy Mother Russia, Osprey Publishing, 2003, p. 83. Subsequently, he forced the Russians to lift their siege of the Battle of Kolberg,Franz A. J. Szabo, The Seven Years War in Europe, 1756-1763, New York, Pearson Education, 2008 , p. 187 inflicting 600 casualties on the Russians. After relieving the siege, his wing moved against the Austrians under Andr√°s Hadik in Saxony. By January 1759, he was back in Pomerania fighting the Swedes, and had taken the towns of Damgarten, Richtenberg, Grimm, Greifswald, Demmin and Anklam for Frederick, pushing the Swedes back to Stralsund and R√ºgen. Residence in G≈Çadysze (Schlodien). The service of younger sons in the Prussian Army firmly united the Prussian elite with the Prussian state. The kings rewarded service with estates and honors. Dohna spent little time at his estate; the King wanted him either in Berlin or in the field. In the years 1758-1759, campaigning in two theaters, Saxony and Upper Pomerania, some distant from one another, damaged his health. In April 1759, Frederick recalled him to Berlin to recover, writing that Dohna was too sick to continue: \\"Vous √™tes trop malade pour vous charger du commandement. Vous ferez bien de vous faire transporter ou √† Berlin ou dans un endroit o√π vous pourrez remettre votre sant√©.\\" (\\"You are too sick to lead your troops; bring yourself to Berlin where you can recover your health.\\") He was replaced by General Heinrich von Manteuffel.Eduard Lange, Die soldaten Friedrichs des Grossen, H. Mendelssohn, 1853 Dohna. p. 72-73. After his recovery, he rejoined the army at Landsberg on the Warthe. On 24 June 1759 he marched with Manteuffel into Poland in their unsuccessful effort to prevent the Russians from advancing into Silesia. On 22 July 1759, he opposed the Russian army at Z√ºllichau, but he again was recalled to Berlin for health reasons before the armies could engage. Carl Heinrich von Wedel, his successor at Z√ºllichau, engaged the Russian army at the Battle of Kay, which the Prussians lost with high casualties. After his recall, Dohna lived in Berlin until his death on 19 May 1762; his name is engraved on the Frederick II the Great Equestrian Memorial.Denkmal K√∂nig Friedrichs des Grossen: enth√ºllt am 31.

His poetry and plays have been translated into several languages (English, Russian, Japanese, Hungarian) Danish, German). His theatrical output has been staged in France, Canada and Russia. Many of his books (short stories, plays, poetry) have been published in Greece, Romania, India, Japan, Italy, South Africa and the United States.

Several reviews and essays have been published on his poetry in English, in French and in Romanian. In 2004, Denis Emorine was awarded first prize at the Feile Filiochta International Poetry Contest.

In 2017, his poem Je te rejoindrai was translated in English and Bengali and published in the Amaravati Poetic Prism international poetry anthology in India. =Themes= Writing, for Emorine, is a way of harnessing time in its incessant flight. Themes that re-occur throughout his writing include the Doppelg√§nger, lost or shattered identity, and mythical Venice, a place that truly fascinates him. He also has a great interest for Eastern Europe. The poetry of Emorine invites us to participate in the birth of the world. In his poetry, the \\"I trembles with life, with love, with death and like a magic well in turn is emptied and refilled with emotions and sensations\\". His poetry is the research of the eternal through beauty, love, tenderness and the profoundness of the soul and of the self.

In 1948, Costa had his first experience in stained glass in a church in Dundee, Scotland. Two years later, at the age of sixteen he finished his studies of violin and harmony at the Accademia of Santa Cecilia in Rome and his Jesuit Classical education. He continued his studies, simultaneously, in French language and literature in Geneva, architecture in Zurich and studied at L‚ÄôEcole des Art et M√©tiers in Paris. During this time, while in Vence and Antibes, France, he often met with Nicolas de Sta√´l, Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse and other artists. After the death of Nicolas de Stael, Franco Costa left for South America where he travelled to Argentina and Brazil, mainly for the project of building Brasilia with his uncle Lucio Costa. During his time in South America he encountered, among others, Che Guevara, Manuel Kantor and Hugo del Carril. Returning to Europe in 1965, Franco collaborated with French and Italian high fashion as a stylist for new design of fabrics, used by Dior, Lancetti, Gr√®s and Valentino.. In 1967 he travelled to Ethiopia where he published his book ‚ÄúTheodor II‚Äù (a story on Emperor Theodor‚Äôs life). While travelling through China, India and Nepal he was inspired by oriental arts. He returned in Europe in 1968 when he collaborated with Federico Fellini as a costume designer and assistant art director for the film ‚ÄúJuliet of the spirits‚Äù. In 1971, he collaborated, in Argentina, with the writer of ‚ÄúClockwork Orange‚Äù and later with the director Stanley Kubrick for both theaterplay and film. Since the mid-seventies, numerous exhibitions have been held in South America and Europe, especially in Sweden, where the Light of Sweden Foundation was founded in 1978. Among other charitable purposes, the foundation was founded for starving children around the world. The artist donated part of his income and also motivated other people to donate. In 1980 he was official artist of the America's Cup, which led the way for his participation in several other sporting events. In 1988 he was in Kiel, where he became official artist of the Baltic Match Race and received positive reviews for his pictures. This led to a long-lasting friendship with the region of Schleswig-Holstein. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Holocaust and the memorial concert of Gilbert Levine in Rome, Costa created the painting Never more Holocaust in 1994, which he donated to Pope John Paul II. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Nord-Ostsee-Kanal, he created several paintings, which were exhibited throughout Northern Europe, in 1995, among others, at Villa Harvey Dr√§ger in Hamburg In support of young artists Franco Costa has also invested both time and money. In 1997 he founded his foundation Usedom feeling. A large part of his work were exhibited in the museum in Scheveningen in the Netherlands.

The group was founded in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2013 and is currently based in Richmond, Virginia. 2019 Constitutional amendment In 2018, OneVirginia2021 convened a bipartisan committee of former legislators. This committee drafted a model constitutional amendment, which was proposed to the Virginia State Assembly in the 2019 session. The proposal emphasized a separate redistricting commission, transparency and citizen participation. Many of these recommendations were included in the legislation passed in the 2019 Assembly Session. In 2019, the Virginia General Assembly passed the ‚Äúfirst read‚Äù of a constitutional amendment, Virginia Redistricting Reform Amendment (HJ615/SJ306), that would end partisan gerrymandering in the commonwealth. This bill was passed by a vote of 83-15 in the House of Delegates and 39-1 in the Virginia Senate. The main components of this include citizen involvement, transparency, and mitigation of partisan gerrymandering. It would create a sixteen-member advisory commission and establish redistricting criteria for congressional and state legislative districts. In order for the Virginia Constitution to be fully amended, it must be passed again in Spring 2020 by the state legislature and November 2020 by Virginians.  Other efforts  On September 14, 2015, OneVirginia2021 filed a suit in Vesilind v. Virginia State Board of Elections claiming 11 Virginia state districts fail the criteria of compactness outlined by the Virginia State Constitution. In an official release, OneVirginia2021 executive director Brian Cannon says, ‚ÄúFar from having a standard, the legislature effectively ignored the Constitution on this point, and gave us distorted, weirdly shaped districts that break up communities and rig elections by depriving voters of meaningful competition‚Äù. The Virginia supreme court upheld the districts. In 2015, OneVirginia2021 backed SJ 284, an independent redistricting commission with non-partisan criteria co-patroned by Virginia Senators Jill Vogel (R) and Louise Lucas (D). OneVirginia2021, in conjunction with Richmond public broadcasting station WCVE, produced a documentary film about gerrymandering. The documentary examines the historical context and consequences of gerrymandering through a multi-partisan lens. The documentary is titled GerryRIGGED: Turning Democracy On Its Head and was premiered on WCVE on October 24, 2016.

He participated in the Pomeranian campaign of 1715 and the first two of Frederick's Silesian wars, was wounded at Chotusitz, and commanded an infantry regiment at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. He received the Order of the Black Eagle, the Order Pour le Merite and his name is inscribed on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. Family Heinrich Manteuffel was born in Gro√ü-Poplow, Pomerania (Popielewo) on 7 November 1696, the son of Ewald von Manteuffel (1645‚Äì1723) and Sophie von Kameke (died 26 July 1699). He joined the Prussian military as a young man.Eduard Lange, Die Soldaten Friedrichs des Grossen, H. Mendelssohn, 1853 Heinrich von Manteuffel. p. 75. Manteuffel's military career modeled that of other Junker sons. Many of the Junkers owned immense estates, especially in the north-eastern half of Germany (i.e. the Prussian provinces of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, West Prussia, East Prussia and Posen)). Their younger sons followed careers as soldiers (Fahnenjunker) (the Junkers controlled the Prussian Army).William W.

He advanced through the ranks, seeing action under command of Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin. Throughout his career, he demonstrated a cool head even in the heat of battle; at the Battle of Prague, he showed considerable courage in picking up the fallen regimental flag, handing it to a Junker to carry, and leading his regiment forward despite intensive cannon fire. thumbManteuffel and Schwerin at the Battle of Prague.

When, the following year, the Duke of Bevern became governor of Stettin, Manteuffel again received the supreme command of troops in Pomerania when Christoph II von Dohna marched to Saxony in November; even when Dohna had returned from Saxony, Manteuffel retained his independence; the king expressly instructed Dohna to avail himself of Manteuffel's council.Artikel \\"Manteuffel, Heinrich von\\" von Bernhard von Poten in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 20 (1884), S. 259‚Äì260, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, Manfeuffel (Version vom 7. Dezember 2016, 19:16 Uhr UTC) In the spring of 1759, when Dohna went to Berlin to recuperate from illness, Manteuffel assumed Dohna's command. In the middle of May, Manteuffel led the greater part of the troops to Stargard against the Russians. Here Dohna, now advised by Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow, resumed command briefly. Manteuffel fought at the Battle of Kay on 23 April 1759, and was wounded there while trying to break the Russian right flank; later, in Berlin, he was ordered to form a corps with which he was to expel the Swedes from the Prussian territory. In January 1760 he attempted to push the enemy back, he was attacked and wounded on the 28th of that month in the early morning hours at Anklam, while he and his troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Swedes. An armistice of Ribnitz, concluded on 7 April 1762, ended the Pomeranian War. His injuries, though, proved sufficient to retire. He went to his estate Collatz in the district of Belgard in Hinterpommern, where he died on 10 July 1778. In February 1759, Frederick awarded him the Order of the Black Eagle. In 1851, his name was included on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great.Denkmal K√∂nig Friedrichs des Grossen: enth√ºllt am 31.

Origin The regiment was formed in March 1942 from the short-lived 89th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery, which had only been raised in the previous March as part of the rapid expansion of British Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences.Farndale, Annex M.89 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.133 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. =89th Searchlight Regiment= 89th Searchlight Regiment was formed on 4 March 1941 at Exeter under 60th AA Brigade in 8th AA Division. The four batteries were drawn from different training regiments, each formed around a cadre of experienced men provided by an existing S/L regiment:Frederick, pp. 861, 875.89 S/L Rgt War Diary 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3109. * 536th Battery from a cadre of 67th (Welch Regiment) S/L Rgt at 203 S/L Training Rgt at Blandford Camp, with personnel mainly from Newcastle upon Tyne * 541st Battery from a cadre of 41st (North Staffs) S/L Rgt at 235 S/L Training Rgt at Troon, with personnel mainly from Glasgow * 542nd Battery from a cadre of 36th (Middlesex) S/L Rgt at 236 S/L Training Rgt at Oswestry, with personnel mainly from London * 543rd Battery from a cadre of 64th (1/6th Essex) S/L Rgt at 237 S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, Northern Ireland, with personnel mainly from Manchester. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) under Lt-Col J.H. Boyd, Royal Engineers, was established at Bolham, Devon, and the batteries were deployed across Devonshire as equipment arrived. The regiment exposed its first S/L beams on the night of 24 April. Thereafter there were frequent alerts as enemy aircraft attacked targets round Exeter and Plymouth during the closing weeks of The Blitz. On 29 June one of 543 Bty's sites received damage from a bomb landing nearby. Anti-Aircraft Command's searchlights had been deployed in clusters, but in September 1941 this arrangement was changed and 89th S/L Rgt's lights were redeployed singly to form a 'killer belt' to assist Royal Air Force night-fighters.Routledge, p. 399.Sainsbury, p. 140. However, in October 1941, 89th S/L Rgt was ordered to redeploy again to provide closely spaced S/L cover within the Plymouth Gun Defence Area (GDA), with RHQ moving to Buckland Filleigh. In December, orders were received for 543 S/L Bty to leave the regiment and move to Kent (it soon joined 33rd (St Pancras) S/L Rgt),Sainsbury, p. 141.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941 (15 January 1942 amendments), TNA file WO 212/80. while the rest of 89th S/L Rgt was to be converted to the Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) gun role. Lt-Col Boyd left to return to the Royal Engineers and was replaced by Lt-Col H.M. Powell, Royal Artillery. The regiment was relieved by 74th (Essex Fortress) S/L Rgt and moved into camp at St Audries, close to the School of AA Instruction at Watchet. RHQ was established at Bicknoller. =133rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment= Bofors 40 mm LAA gun equipped with Stiffkey-Stick sights 133rd LAA Regiment was formally established on 23 March 1942, with 536, 541 and 542 S/L Btys becoming 442, 443 and 444 LAA Btys. 442 LAA Battery was retrained at 10th LAA Training Regiment at Deepcut Barracks and the others at 225th LAA Training Rgt at Newquay. A more experienced fourth battery was due to be formed from three separate troops provided by the batteries of 60th LAA Rgt; however, in the end the fourth battery (298) was transferred complete from 49th LAA Rgt on 22 April.Frederick, pp. 806, 841.89 S/L Rgt War Diary January‚ÄìMarch 1942, TNA file WO 166/7834.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. Two more batteries joined over the following months: 475 LAA Bty on 19 May from 86th LAA Rgt and 465 LAA Bty on 10 July from 72nd LAA Rgt, but on the later date 298 and 475 LAA Btys left the regiment, transferred to 83rd LAA Rgt (in the Orkney and Shetland Defences (OSDEF)) and 134th LAA Rgt respectively. Finally, on 3 October 465 LAA Bty also left, for 142nd LAA Rgt, leaving 133rd LAA Rgt with its three original batteries. 133rd LAA Regiment had initially rejoined 60th AA Bde in 8th AA Division, but in June 1942 it moved to 69th AA Brigade, still in 8th AA Division in South West England.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. By the end of September, RHQ and 444 LAA Btys had moved to 46th AA Brigade covering Bristol, while 442 and 443 LAA Btys remained with 69th AA Bde.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. Overlord Bofors LAA gun, winter 1944‚Äì45. The regiment left AA Command in February‚ÄìMarch 1943 and joined 74th AA Brigade under War Office control. 74th AA Brigade was one of the mobile formations created to support 21st Army Group in the Operation Overlord planned invasion of Normandy.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/9. For the next year, 133rd LAA Rgt trained for Overlord with 74th AA Bde. LAA regiments at this time comprised three batteries of three troops, each equipped with six towed Bofors 40 mm guns using Stiffkey Stick sights. As a mobile unit, 133rd would also have had a Royal Electrical And Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop and a detachment of the Royal Corps of Signals.Routledge, p. 306. 74th AA Brigade landed in Normandy in August 1944 to join First Canadian Army.Routledge, p. 315. At the end of the month, 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. In the last days of the month, 74th AA Bde's LAA regiments were deployed to guard the crossings of the River Seine.Routledge, p. 320. Antwerp V-1 in flight over Antwerp V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. Clearing the Scheldt Estuary and bringing the port of Antwerp into use as a supply base was an important element in the Overlord plan. The planners envisaged a large GDA to deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers').Routledge, pp. 322, 333. On 18 October, 133rd LAA Rgt reinforced 5th Royal Marine AA Bde at Antwerp.Routledge, Table LII, p. 331; pp. 334‚Äì5. To prevent downed V-1s falling in the city and dock area, the guns had to be positioned at least 10 miles outside the city, integrated into a system of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. This 'X' defence deployment, including 133rd LAA Rgt, took its full form in December 1944, in time for the peak in V-1 attacks.Routledge, pp. 336‚Äì7; Table LIII, p. 342. Rhineland By February 1945, 133rd LAA Rgt had rejoined 74th AA Bde with II Canadian Corps for Operation Veritable to clear the Reichswald and break the Siegfried Line. The brigade's role was to protect the vital Waal and Maas river crossings immediately behind the front. This role continued during the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) in late March.Routledge, pp. 349‚Äì51. 74th AA Bde, including 133rd LAA Rgt, remained in support of First Canadian Army until VE Day.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. After occupation duties with British Army of the Rhine, RHQ and 442, 443 and 444 LAA Btys were disbanded on 6 March 1946.

Autogamy is predominantly observed in the form of self- pollination, a reproductive mechanism employed by many flowering plants. However, species of protists have also been observed using autogamy as a means of reproduction. Flowering plants engage in autogamy regularly, while the protists that engage in autogamy only do so in stressful environments. Occurrence =Protists= Paramecium aurelia Paramecium aurelia is the most commonly studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, Paramecium aurelia typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization. However, studies have shown that when put under nutritional stress, Paramecium aurelia will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei.Berger, James D. \\"Autogamy in Paramecium cell cycle stage-specific commitment to meiosis.\\" Experimental cell research 166.2 (1986): 475-485. This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps. First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei. Some of these daughter nuclei will continue to divide to create potential future gametic nuclei. Of these potential gametic nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four daughter nuclei arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism. The other two daughter nuclei become the gametic micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization. These nuclear divisions are observed mainly when the Paramecium aurelia is put under nutritional stress. Research shows that Paramecium aurelia undergo autogamy synchronously with other individuals of the same species. Clonal aging and rejuvenation In Paramecium tetraurelia, vitality declines over the course of successive asexual cell divisions by binary fission. Clonal aging is associated with a dramatic increase in DNA damage. When paramecia that have experienced clonal aging undergo meiosis, either during conjugation or automixis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear DNA that had just experienced meiosis followed by syngamy. These paramecia are rejuvenated in the sense of having a restored clonal lifespan. Thus it appears that clonal aging is due in large part to the progressive accumulation of DNA damage, and that rejuvenation is due to repair of DNA damage during meiosis that occurs in the micronucleus during conjugation or automixis and reestablishment of the macronucleus by replication of the newly repaired micronuclear DNA. Tetrahymena rostrata Similar to Paramecium aurelia, the parasitic ciliate Tetrahymena rostrata has also been shown to engage in meiosis, autogamy and development of new macronuclei when placed under nutritional stress. Due to the degeneration and remodeling of genetic information that occurs in autogamy, genetic variability arises and possibly increases an offspring‚Äôs chances of survival in stressful environments. Allogromia laticollaris Allogromia laticollaris is perhaps the best- studied foraminiferan amoeboid for autogamy. Allogromia laticollaris can alternate between sexual reproduction via cross-fertilization and asexual reproduction via binary fission. The details of the life cycle of Allogromia laticollaris are unknown, but similar to Paramecium aurelia, Allogromia laticollaris is also shown to sometimes defer to autogamous behavior when placed in nutritional stress. As seen in Paramecium, there is some nuclear dimorphism observed in Allogromia laticollaris. There are often observations of macronuclei and chromosomal fragments coexisting in Allogromia laticollaris. This is indicative of nuclear and chromosomal degeneration, a process similar to the subdivisions observed in Paramecium aurelia. Multiple generations of haploid Allogromia laticollaris individuals can exist before autogamy actually takes place. The autogamous behavior in Allogromia laticollaris has the added consequence of giving rise to daughter cells that are substantially smaller than those rising from binary fission.K., Sen Gupta B. Modern Foraminifera. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1999. Print. It is hypothesized that this is a survival mechanism employed when the cell is in stressful environments, and thus not able to allocate all resources to creating offspring. If a cell was under nutritional stress and not able to function regularly, there would be a strong possibility of its offspring‚Äôs fitness being sub-par. =Self-pollination in flowering plants= Self- pollination is an example of autogamy that occurs in flowering plants. Self- pollination occurs when the sperm in the pollen from the stamen of a plant goes to the carpels of that same plant and fertilizes the egg cell present. Self-pollination can either be done completely autogamously or geitonogamously. In the former, the egg and sperm cells that united came from the same flower. In the latter, the sperm and egg cells can come from a different flower on the same plant. While the latter method does blur the lines between autogamous self-fertilization and normal sexual reproduction, it is still considered autogamous self-fertilization. Self-pollination can lead to inbreeding depression due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations. Meiosis followed by self-pollination results in little genetic variation, raising the question of how meiosis in self-pollinating plants is adaptively maintained over an extended period in preference to a less complicated and less costly asexual ameiotic process for producing progeny. For instance, Arabidopsis thaliana is a predominantly self-pollinating plant that has an outcrossing rate in the wild estimated at less than 0.3%, and self-pollination appears to have evolved roughly a million years ago or more. An adaptive benefit of meiosis that may explain its long-term maintenance in self- pollinating plants is efficient recombinational repair of DNA damage. Advantages of autogamy There are several advantages for the self- fertilization observed in flowering plants and protists. In flowering plants, it is important for some plants not to be dependent on pollinating agents that other plants rely on for fertilization. This is unusual, however, considering that many plant species have evolved to become incompatible with their own gametes. While these species would not be well served by having autogamous self-fertilization as a reproductive mechanism, other species, which do not have self-incompatibility, would benefit from autogamy. Protists have the advantage of diversifying their modes of reproduction. This is useful for a multitude of reasons. First, if there is an unfavorable change in the environment that puts the ability to deliver offspring at risk, then it is advantageous for an organism to have autogamy at its disposal. In other organisms, it is seen that genetic diversity arising from sexual reproduction is maintained by changes in the environment that favor certain genotypes over others. Aside from extreme circumstances, it is possible that this form of reproduction gives rise to a genotype in the offspring that will increase fitness in the environment. This is due to the nature of the genetic degeneration and remodeling intrinsic to autogamy in unicellular organisms. Thus, autogamous behavior may become advantageous to have if an individual wanted to ensure offspring viability and survival. This advantage also applies to flowering plants. However, it is important to note that this change has not shown to produce a progeny with more fitness in unicellular organisms.Eckert, Christopher G., and Christopher R. Herlihy. \\"Using a Cost-benefit Approach to Understand the Evolution of Self-fertilization in Plants: The Perplexing Case of Aquilegia Canadensis (Ranunculaceae).\\" Plant Species Biology 19.3 (2004): 159-73. Web. It is possible that the nutrition deprived state of the parent cells before autogamy created a barrier for producing offspring that could thrive in those same stressful environments. Disadvantages of autogamy In flowering plants, autogamy has the disadvantage of producing low genetic diversity in the species that use it as the predominant mode of reproduction. This leaves those species particularly susceptible to pathogens and viruses that can harm it. In addition, the foraminiferans that use autogamy have shown to produce substantially smaller progeny as a result. This indicates that since it is generally an emergency survival mechanism for unicellular species, the mechanism does not have the nutritional resources that would be provided by the organism if it were undergoing binary fission. Evolution of autogamy The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in plants. About 10-15% of flowering plants are predominantly self-fertilizing. Since autogamy in flowering plants and autogamy in unicellular species is fundamentally different, and plants and protists are not related, it is likely that both instances evolved separately. In flowering plants, it is believed that autogamy evolved one million years ago. However, due to the little overall genetic variation that arises in progeny, it is not fully understood how autogamy has been maintained in the tree of life.

She went to graduate school at Harvard University where she obtained her Ed.M in Human Learning and Development in 1970. Brooks- Gunn continued her studies the University of Pennsylvania, receiving her Ph.D. in human learning and development under the supervision of Michael Lewis. Career Brooks-Gunn is the Virginia and Leonard Marx Professor of Child Development at Teachers College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University and Co-Director of the National Center for Children and Families at Teachers College, Columbia University. Her current studies include the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and Early Head Start. Brooks-Gunn has written numerous books and edited volumes, and has published over 500 articles. Her work focuses on neighborhood poverty, growing up poor, and adolescent mothers. Brooks-Gunn's work led to increased understanding of the influence of parents and schools on child development. Her books exposed how children raised in poverty experience more negative cognitive and educational outcomes than more affluent children. She has led programs for children and parents, holding meetings that aim to better the lives of children and youth. Her programs include home visiting for pregnant women and mothers-to-be, early childhood educational programs for children of ages 12 to 36 months, and after-school programs for older children. = Representative work = In one of her books, Brooks-Gunn and colleagues focused on developmental outcomes for adolescent mothers and their children in relation to school, work, the presence of the baby's father is in their lives, and other factors. In another study, Brooks- Gunn and colleagues focused on the epidemic of obesity which many people suffer from today, including young children. They predicted racial/ethnic differences in obesity in a sample of 3-year-olds from low income families. They found evidence of obesity start at age three, with children of obese mothers having a higher chance of being overweight, and with heightened risk of obesity among Hispanic children. Another study compared behavioral problems associated with acting out in children growing up in a single parent versus dual parent households. Child behavioral outcomes were associated with parental resources, parental mental health, parental relationship quality, parenting quality, and father involvement. Children coming from so-called \\"fragile families\\" fared worse than those with more stable family structures. Awards and honours Brooks-Gunn received the APA Award for Distinguished Contributions to Research in Public Policy in 2002 for contributions to helping children, youth, and families. She offered solutions to family problems through interventions and programs for families of different backgrounds to provide them with the needed resources for a better future. She has also been awarded the James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award from the Association for Psychological Science, the Urie Bronfenbrenner Award for Lifetime Contribution to Developmental Psychology in the Service of Science and Society from the American Psychological Association, the Distinguished Contributions to the Public Policy for Children Award from the Society for Research in Child Development, the Hill Award for Excellence in Theory Development and Research on Adolescents from the Society for Research on Adolescence, and the Harvard University Graduate School of Education Alumni Council Award. She is a member of the National Academy of Education and the National Academy of Medicine, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the New York Academy of Science. In 2009, she received an honorary doctorate in science from Northwestern University.

After graduation and Arbeitsdienst, in 1941 she started studies in art history in Berlin, but was drafted for military service after a few weeks and worked during the Second World War as a secretary for the German military intelligence in Berlin, Paris and Breslau. Of her three brothers only the youngest survived the war. From 1945 she worked in Frankfurt for the Agency for Decartelization of IG Farben. In 1951 she married Eberhard Friedrich Br√ºnig (born 1926), who had an education in forestry.  Career  From 1953 on, her professional development underwent a change. During her stays in Asia, America, Australia and finally back in Europe, she worked and taught in the fields of nature conservation, primatology, anthropology, archaeology and art history. = Sarawak (Borneo) = In 1953, she went with her first husband, Eberhard Friedrich Br√ºnig, who took up a position in the British colonial service and later became an expert in tropical forestry,E.F.

There she started to work for the curator of the Sarawak State Museum, Tom Harrisson, \\"a romantic polymath, a drunken bully, an original-thinking iconoclast, a dreadful husband and father, [and] a fearless adventurer\\";Tom Harrisson was curator of the Sarawak Museum from June 1947 until November 1966. they married in 1956.  Animal conservation projects  Tom and Barbara Harrisson worked on a broad spectrum of activities ‚Äì among them conservation projects for sea turtles and orangutans close to Bako National Park. Barbara Harrisson became a pioneerAnne E. Russon: (Chapter 23) Orangutan Rehabilitation and Reintroduction: Successes, Failures, and Role in Conservation, in S. A. Wich (Ed.) Orangutans Compared, Oxford University Press (2007). in raising and rehabilitation of young Orang-Utans, who had lost their mothers and their habitat due to deforestation ‚Äì activities which later led to the establishment of reserves like the Orang Utan Rehabilitation Center in Sepilok/Sabah (since 1964) and the Gunung Leuser National Park in Sumatra (since 1980). In 1973, she became an officer of the International Primate Protection League (IPPL) ‚Äì in 2015 she was still on the advisory boardInternational Primate Protection League: Representatives and Advisors ‚Äì as her interests extended to regulations for the trade with primates, which ‚Äì in collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) led to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (drafted 1963, opened for signature in 1973, entered into force on 1 July 1975).  Archaeological and anthropological research  Entrance of the Niah Great Cave 'Deep Skull' (Homo sapiens skull from the Niah Great Cave) The main interest of Tom and Barbara Harrisson was on archaeology and anthropology. They undertook pioneering excavations in the West Mouth of the Niah Great Cave. Their most important finding was on 7 February 1958, when Barbara Harrisson and colleagues discovered an inverted human skull while carefully digging in Hell Trench H/6, about 2.5 m below original ground surface.John Krigbaum and Ipoi Datan: The Deep Skull and Associated Human Remains From Niah Cave in The Perak Man and Other Prehistoric Skeletons of Malaysia (2005), ed. Zuraina Majid, Pulau Pinang: Penerbit University Sains Malaysia, p. 131-154. The surrounding deposits were initially dated to about 45,000 to 39,000 years by radiocarbon dating, which was received with much scepticism by many scientists. But later excavations and new carbon-dating confirmed the results of Barbara and Tom Harrisson,Chris Stringer: The Origin of Our Species, Penguin (2012), , p. 235. confirming the 'Deep Skull' still as the earliest fossil proofing the presence of modern humans in Southeast Asia.Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History - Niah Cave Heirloom jar (Martaban) from Borneo. This jar, a gift, Barbara Harrisson owned since 1960. Today it is part of the Princessehof collection. Barbara Harrisson ‚Äì still without any formal education ‚Äì led excavations in Niah and other places in Borneo, and documented this work in many publications. During this work she became a specialist in ceramics. = Ithaca (United States) = In November 1966 Tom Harrisson retired as curator of the Sarawak Museum. In 1967, the couple went to Cornell University (Ithaca, USA), where Tom got a teaching assignment at the South-East Asian Program. When Tom Harrisson left to Europe for a new marriage, Barbara ‚Äì still without any formal education ‚Äì took over his seminars at Cornell. 1972 she finally started her own university education as an art historian and obtained her master's degree in 1974. Her time in the USA was interrupted by many stays in Southeast Asia. Her PhD thesis on Heirloom Jars of Borneo under Stanley O'Connor, professor for South-east Asian art history, was started at this time and was finished in 1984. = Perth (Australia) = In 1976 she joined the Asia Department of the Western Australia Institute of Technology at the University of Perth, Australia, as a lecturer. = Leeuwarden (The Netherlands) = Keramiekmuseum Princessehof in Leeuwarden Barbara Harrisson (1995) In 1977 Barbara Harrisson was appointed director of the Princessehof Ceramics Museum in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands ‚Äì a significant ceramics museum, which has been put on the international map by her successful work including numerous exhibitions and publications.

It protects a mountainous area of Atlantic Forest. Location The Xitu√© Ecological Station (ESEC) is in the Serra de Paranapiacaba in the municipality of Ribeir√£o Grande in the southeast S√£o Paulo state. It has an area of about . The station in on the Guapiara Plateau, with altitudes that range from . It adjoins the central section of the Intervales State Park to the south. To the northwest the ESEC adjoins the Hotel Para√≠so Ecolodge, a sustainable ecotourism enterprise. It lies in the largest remnant of Atlantic Forest in the state, part of the Paranapiacaba ecological continuum. It is accessed through the Intervales State Park headquarters, about from the state capital. History The Xitu√© Ecological Station was created by state decree 26.890 of 1987, with the objective of ensuring full protection of flora, fauna and natural beauty, as well as supporting educational, recreational and scientific purposes. Since being created it has been the base for many research projects due to the good state of conservation of its forests. The ESEC is managed by the Forest Foundation of S√£o Paulo. S√£o Paulo state decree 58.148 of 21 June 2012 created the Paranapiacaba Conservation Units Mosaic, including the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park, Intervales State Park, Carlos Botelho State Park, Xitu√© Ecological Station, Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park and the portion of the Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area in the municipalities of Eldorado, Sete Barras, Tapira√≠, Juqui√°, Ribeir√£o Grande and Cap√£o Bonito. The purpose was to promote integrated and participatory management of the conservation units, and to seek to guarantee conservation of the areas covered. On 30 March 2016 the State Council for the Environment (Consema) approved the management plan for the ESEC, which defines zoning, allowed use and measures to protect and promote biodiversity by integrating the unit into the economic and social life of the neighboring communities. Environment The K√∂ppen climate classification of the region is Cfb: temperate, humid with no dry season. Temperatures range from . Average annual rainfall is . There is a rainy season from October to March and a cold and less rainy season from April to September. Vegetation in the ESEC is 57.1% dense montane rainforest and 41.3% open rainforest with bamboos. There are small areas of dense alluvial rainforest (1.2%), dense upper montane rainforest (0.12%) and secondary growth (0.17%). The overstory is generally medium in height with an irregular canopy. There are two main trails in the ESEC. On the Xitu√© trail the bamboo Guadua tagoara dominates, with more developed vegetation in the valleys of the small stream that drain the area. On the Rio das Almas trail, which follows the das Almas River, there are more stretches with large trees. 123 native species of flora were identified in a study published in 2014, in 82 genera and 40 families. Nine species are in the S√£o Paulo State, Brazil and global red lists. 91 species of birds have been identified in the ESEC, of which 48 are endemic to the Atlantic Forest biome. Eight species are considered endangered in the state of S√£o Paulo. Of there two are also included in the list for Brazil and three in the global list. This includes the critically endangered Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris).

Originally it was played by Maya children. This game is mainly played by children over 6 years. To play timbomba one needs a place without obstacles and two round sticks: a 10 in long stick and a 5 in long conical stick with tips (a kimbomba). A player stands in a base similar to a baseball base, then, he takes the longer stick and hits the kimbomba, which is on the ground. The shorter stick is raised and the player hits it again, like a baseball. There are two versions but in both it is necessary to get the stick as far away as possible. At least two players are needed.  Versions  Many versions have been created through time. In all of them the player stands inside a 2-meter circle, which in its center has a 15 cm square where the kimbomba is located. The kimbomba is hit and then, the game starts. For both versions it is necessary that each player has their pair of sticks. = Version 1: Individual = Each player hits his kimbomba and hits it as far away as possible. After every hit a referee measures the distance that the kimbomba reached. The longest distance reached is marked with a stake on the ground. Once the referee has measured the distance, it is the turn of the next player. The winner is the one who hits the kimbomba further. The maximum number of players that can play this version is 10. = Version 2: Teams = This one is not uniform like the first version because the rules and the way to make points change according to the place where it is played, but they all are similar to baseball. In addition to the original circle, there are 3 bases: first, second and third base. There are 2 teams that take turns batting, there's not a specific number of players per team but 5 players is the maximum recommended. One team hits the kimbomba while the other one tries to catch it. From the circle, the first player of the first team on bat hits the kimbomba, then, the player leaves the stick inside the square and runs to the third base. If he reaches the third base before an opponent makes him an out, he scores one point. If one opponent catches the kimbomba in the air, they get one out. If the kimbomba hits the ground once, the opposite team can take the kimbomba and throw it to the square inside the base. If the kimbomba hits the other stick, then, they get one out. After 3 outs the turn ends. The game finally ends when one of the teams got the points that were agreed on before the beginning of the game.  Similar games around the world  = Gilli-Danda = From India. There are two sticks, Danda is the longest one and Gilli the smallest. = Billarda = From Galicia, Spain.

Alongside Manvini Bhavai, it is one of Patel's two most widely acclaimed novels. It is a romantic tragedy of Kanji and Jivi, born in different castes. It follows the troubles they face in their love story.  Origin  Gujarati writer-editor, Jhaverchand Meghani, had asked Pannalal Patel to write a story for Phulchhab, a Gujarati daily. Patel then wrote Malela Jeev in 24 days and it was serialised in the daily Phulchhab. It was later published as a book in 1941.  Characters  * Kanji - a gentleman boy, born in a Patel family. * Jivi - a beautiful woman, born in a barber family. * Hiro - Kanji's friend * Dhulo - a barber, who lives in Kanji's village.  Plot Kaleshwari Fair mentioned in the novel, where Kanji and Jivi first met Kanji and Jivi live in Jogipara and Udharia villages near Idar and they belong to different castes. They met each other at the Janmashtami fair and fell in love. They were unable to marry due to coming from different castes. Kanji also has the social responsibility of his elder brother's family. But he finds it difficult to live without Jivi. His friend Hiro suggests having Jivi marry Dhula, the barber in their own village. After a great psychological struggle, Kanji agrees with Hira and get Jivi married to Dhula. But his plan does not bring the expected result. Dhula's suspicious nature, his tyranny, and his poor treatment of Jivi causes Kanji's plan to be unsuccessful. Kanji's God-fearing nature and his indecisive mental state also play a role in his failure. Kanji moves from the village to the city to keep himself away from Jivi. Jivi, meanwhile, is tired of the daily quarrels and beatings and tries to commit suicide. But, by mistake, her tyrannical husband Dhulo loses his life and she falls into an emotional imbalance, yearning for her beloved Kanji. In the end Kanji's worldly love transformed into a spiritual love, and so he comes from the city to be with Jivi. Reception The books was well received by readers and critics. Meghani had written, \\"It is not only the story of Kanji and Jivi but also the story of all of us. It is the sensitive story of the entire society. And herein lies the aesthetic beauty of this novel.\\" Chandrakant Topiwala has written, \\"It is writer's own local world set in local elements of village reality which is synonymous to the whole world at the level of motion of story elements and psychoanalysis.\\" Sundaram had said, \\"The story in its present form can serve as a representative of Gujarati literature in any Indian literature and, with some reservations, in world literature.\\" Malela Jeevni Samiksha is a criticism of it written by Labhshankar Thakar with Chinu Modi and Manhar Modi. It has been reprinted several times; in 1944, 1947, 1950, 1956, 1960, 1962, 1967, 1969, 1973, 1977, 1984, 1986, 1991, 1993, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016. Translation and adaptations This novel has been translated into several Indian languages such as in Hindi, Punjabi, Kannada and as Kalasina Jeevithalu in Telugu by Vemuri Anjaneya Sarma.

After graduating with a small gold medal, he travelled along the Black Sea coast with Count Pavel Kutaisov, then worked as a draftsman for Auguste de Montferrand on Saint Isaac's Cathedral. From 1833 to 1836, he was in the service of Mikhail Vorontsov, Governor-General of Novorossiya, travelling throughout Crimea, sketching nature, ruins, and ethnic customs. Many of these sketches later became paintings. Through Vorontsov, he became a good friend of Alexander Pushkin and decorated his office with a landscape of Darial Gorge. After 1838, he accompanied his brother, Grigory, and Anton Ivanov-Goluboy along the Volga in a specially equipped boat/studio, making numerous sketches that were later turned into a panorama that was 700 meters (2300 feet) in length and was wound on a roller. Pieces of it are still kept at the National Library of Russia. During the 1840s, the brothers paid several visits to Italy and the Eastern Mediterranean, but their book of lithographs, Palestine: Views Drawn from Life by the Academicians N. and G.

For details on reproduction mechanisms used by fungi, please refer to the page mating in fungi.  Fungal sexual selection requirements  Most fungi can produce asexually and sexually. Currently, sexual selection has been studied to occur more predominantly in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla. Although different sexes are not present within fungi, sexual selection can act due to the presence of different sex roles as well as different mating types as most fungi are hermaphroditic.Nieuwenhuis, B. P. S. and Aanen, D. K. (2012), Sexual selection in fungi. J. Evol. Biol., 25: 2397‚Äì2411. doi:10.1111/jeb.12017 Sex roles can be distinguished in sexually producing filamentous fungi. For example, sexually producing ascomycetes can produce anisogamous gametes. The larger immobile gametes act as female gametes, while the smaller, motile gametes act as male gametes. Increased difference in the operational sex ratio (OSR) due to asymmetry between the sex roles leads to the production of more male gametes. In addition, variation within gamete quality which could affect offspring viability or fitness can also lead to differences in female/male gamete ratios.Beekman M, Nieuwenhuis B, Ortiz-Barrientos D, Evans JP. Sexual selection in hermaphrodites, sperm and broadcast spawners, plants and fungi. Philos Trans R Soc B Biol Sci 2016;371(1706). In addition, sexual selection can occur within fungi if there is a limiting number of a certain type of gamete. The limiting gamete is typically the female gamete as they tend to be more costly to produce and invest more, energetically, in the zygote. Most fungi have a haploid-diploid life cycle. Sexual selection is much more crucial in the diploid phase as the product of the phase immediately undergoes meiosis and can no longer be fertilized again. Sexual selection in mushroom fungi Mushroom-forming fungi within Basidiomycetes produce sexually by the reciprocal migration of nuclei and have a male-biased OSR which aids in supporting that sexual selection is present within fungi. Although there are no traditional males present, there is variation between the mating types responsible for acting as the male or female sex role. Receiving mycelia act as the female gametes while the donating nucleus acts as the male gamete. Sexual selection might occur through male-male competition or by female choice. A study demonstrated that sexual selection does occur between the donating nucleus of the heterokaryon and the receiving homokaryon through the two nuclear types within the heterkaryon. These two nuclear types are in competition with each other to fertilize the homokaryon. Female choice between the nuclear types is also possible as there is a strong bias for one of the two nuclei. However, it is more supported that competition between the donating nuclei is more responsible as it has been shown that there is a variation in the success of various nuclei independent of the receiving mycelium. Some factors that may affect the nuclei‚Äôs success include faster mitotic division, increased migration, and possibly a mechanism that suppresses mitotic division in the competition. Most Basidiomycetes consist of two mating types, A and B, which are unlinked. However, the B locus codes for a larger amount of pheromones through subloci. Each subloci can produce many pheromones yet codes only one receptor resulting in a high redundancy of these pheromones. Although only one pheromone is necessary to fertilize, the presence of such a high amount increases the likelihood of that individual's pheromones to be received. This characteristic is hypothesized to have evolved as a result of sexual selection. Male-male competition in fungi Competition can occur within fungi as it does in plants and animals if an inequality in the ability to access one sex role or mating type is present. This inequality could result in increased competition for access to the other mating type. Competition can also occur if there is a variation in the quality of the gametes. Within fungi, there is competition to fertilize, which can be seen as the equivalent of male-male competition in plants and animals. Sexual selection in fungi aids in explaining certain characteristics including the high redundancy of pheromones in the B mating-type locus as well as strong pheromone signaling in yeasts. Male gametes have the ability to reproduce asexually as asexual spores if they fail to reproduce sexually. Some fungal species are capable of producing male gametes of two different sizes. Throughout evolution, the smaller gametes have lost the ability to produce asexually in order to increase the likelihood of fertilizing a female gamete by decreasing size and increasing both the amount and motility of the male gamete. This is most likely a result of direct competition as a trade-off was made in order to increase the likelihood of fertilization. Pheromone signaling and the presence of male choice Pheromone signaling is used within fungi to either attract a mate or to assess the quality of that gamete; and tends to be more effective when occurring over small distances. Female gametes are typically the ones responsibly for producing pheromones in order to attract a mate. However, pheromones can also be released by conidia.Xu L, Petit E, Hood ME. Variation in mate-recognition pheromones of the fungal genus microbotryum. Heredity 2016;116(1):44-51. Male choice can occur in populations where there is a low concentration of male gametes, allowing them to be selective in which female to fertilize. The female with the highest concentration of pheromone is usually chosen. In situations where fertilization may have to occur over long distances, water-soluble pheromones may be secreted as seen in the female gametes of an aquatic Chytridiomycetes. The same similarly occurs within an aquatic oomycete algae species; also, a variation in the pheromone production related to the male reaction has been observed. Variations within the pheromone production as well as the response have been studied and found be affected by environmental conditions as well as developmental differences between the fungi. Although not proven, the production of pheromones may lead to Fisherian runaway selection in which the production of pheromone increases due to the increase in its preference throughout generations. In addition to pheromone signaling being used as a method in finding a mate, it also appears to be utilized as a method to assess mate quality. Pheromones are costly to produce due to post-translational modification and therefore may be subject to the handicap principle in which an organisms cannot fake its fitness by producing pheromones. In the isogamous budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pheromones are used to distinguish between different mating types and show a preference for higher concentrations of pheromones along with a rejection of lower concentrations. However, all of the pheromone studies within fungi have been performed in a laboratory. In order to further support this hypothesis, more research is necessary on the effects of natural gamete density, motility, and pheromone production in nature., Possible polyandry and female choice Post-copulatory mechanisms may also be present within fungi through polyandry in which zygote-level sexual selection might occur. Within multicellular ascomycete fungi, a haploid mycelium produces a fruiting body which in turn produces many offspring that are also haploid. Each fruiting body has the potential to be fertilized by more than one male gamete. Laboratory experiments have shown that multiple matings are possible and the female has the ability to selectively abort fruiting bodies that have been inappropriately fertilized by a closely related yet incompatible species.Whittle CA, Johannesson H. Evolutionary dynamics of sex-biased genes in a hermaphrodite fungus. Mol Biol Evol 2013;30(11):2435-46. Possible female-female competition in fungi A study has shown that female- biased genes evolve must faster than male-biased genes demonstrated by a rapid protein-level evolution. In most other eukaryotes, male-biased genes demonstrate a faster evolution. This may be due to specific reproductive traits within fungi, possibly allowing female-female competition to occur rather than male-male competition. This is also supported the passive nature of conidia during mating. Due to the presence of pheromones as well as the dispersal of male gametes, two or more female gametes may be attracted to one conidium, or male gamete. The presence of karyogamy further supports the possibility of female-female competition. Within N. crassa, the haploid mycelium undergoes growth as vegetative tissue prior to entering the mating cycle. This vegetative tissue can be used as a source of fertilization and can fuse with the trichogyne. This causes the female gamete to no longer be subject to male-male competition and further fertilization by a conidium. The female-biased genes that were studied and seen to evolve more rapidly than male-biased genes did so regardless of the mechanism of fertilization. Fertilization occurring by the fusion of a female nucleus and male conidium nucleus or between a female nucleus or nucleus from vegetative tissue did not alter this rate of evolution.

Released as a Mother's Day special, it revolves around the holiday from the perspective of a group of babies‚ÄîTommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, and Phil and Lil Deville. Tommy, Phil, and Lil attempt to find the perfect mother for Chuckie (who is raised only by his father Chas) while sharing their favorite memories about their moms. At the end of the episode, Chuckie's mother is revealed to have died of a terminal illness. It concludes with Chuckie and Chas looking through a box of her belongings, including a poem she had written for her son. Meanwhile, Didi Pickles tries to plan the perfect Mother's Day with her mom Minka, while Betty DeVille helps Stu Pickles with his invention to help mothers. Norton Virgien and Toni Vian directed the episode from a script by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, David N. Weiss, Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Series co-creator Paul Germain had pitched two potential storylines to explain the absence of Chuckie's mother, but Nickelodeon executives rejected his proposed ideas that the mother was either divorced from Chas or had died. Before \\"Mother's Day\\" premiered, only minor references to Chuckie's mother had been made. Germain left the show in 1993, and several new writers replaced him. The concept was later revised and approved as a Mother's Day special. Germain said that he was disappointed at being unable to cover the topic during his time on the series. Broadcast on May 6, 1997, in the United States, \\"Mother's Day\\" was one of several half-hour specials that Nickelodeon commissioned for Rugrats. The episode was featured on the 1998 VHS release Rugrats: Mommy Mania, and was later made available for digital download along with the rest of the fourth season. \\"Mother's Day\\" was praised by critics and has been the subject of several retrospective reviews for its treatment of the death of a parent. It was also praised for its positive representation of breastfeeding and expansion on the definition of motherhood. It won the CableACE Award for Writing a Children's Special or Series, and was nominated for the Humanitas Prize for the Children's Animation Category. The series received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards after Nickelodeon submitted \\"Mother's Day\\" for consideration. Plot On Mother's Day, toddler Angelica Pickles constructs a macaroni sculpture of her head as a present to her mother, telling the Rugrats the meaning of the holiday. After dropping off his son Chuckie, Chas Finster gives his friend Didi Pickles a box of his wife's belongings as he fears that Chuckie will find it. Chas does not feel he is ready to talk to Chuckie about his mother. While helping the other babies Phil and Lil DeVille and Tommy Pickles look for the perfect gifts for their mothers, Chuckie feels uncertain about how he should celebrate Mother's Day. Tommy, Phil, and Lil share their favorite memories of their mothers with Chuckie. Phil and Lil say that the best gift they gave their mom was their first laugh. Tommy reminisces about his mom comforting him while he was in a neonatal intensive care unit. The babies think of a plan to find Chuckie a new mother. Their attempts to have Tommy's dog Spike and Lil act as his mom are unsuccessful. Angelica agrees to act as Chuckie's mother only if he completes her macaroni sculpture. Meanwhile, Didi takes her mom Minka to a spa, and Betty DeVille helps Stu Pickles with his invention to help mothers. Angelica tasks Chuckie to pick a dandelion to decorate her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys a majority of the lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelica orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chas' box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chas the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chas decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature. Production alt=An image of a blonde woman wearing a black jacket and white dress shirt. The 23-minute and 46-second episode was written by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, David N. Weiss, Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Directed by Norton Virgien and Toni Vian, it was produced by the animation studio Klasky Csupo Productions, a part of Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Cella Nichols Duffy, Gabor Csupo, Arlene Klasky, Paul De Meyer, Stem, and Weiss also produced the episode. Mark Mothersbaugh and Ruby Andrews contributed to the music. In 2016, co-creator Paul Germain revealed that the concept for the episode, and the discussion about the status of Chuckie's mother, was previously pitched to Nickelodeon executives. She was not included in the first season to avoid the need to animate a completely new character. During the production of the show's second and third seasons, Germain noticed that questions about the character's absence became more prominent. He consulted with fellow co-creator Arlene Klasky, and they concluded that the only two possible ways to address the character was that she was divorced from Chas, or had died before the series' debut. Germain and Klasky initially planned to portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed an idea to reveal that the mother was dead, contending that it would be \\"scary\\" and that \\"children [would not] want to see that.\\" Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: \\"We mention that she exists but we don't tell you what happened to her. We even made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed to go into the subject.\\" Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word \\"dead\\" was never used by any of the characters. The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes \\"Real or Robots?\\" (1991), \\"Chuckie vs. the Potty\\" (1992), and \\"My Friend Barney\\" (1993). Germain left the series in 1993, and several new writers replaced him. At that time, Nickelodeon permitted the writers and animators to include a storyline about the death of Chuckie's mother. The development of the Rugrats Mother's Day television special was announced on December 7, 1996. Kim Cattrall provided the voice for Chuckie's mother, Melinda Finster. Germain described the episode as \\"this whole very maudlin thing,\\" and said that he was disappointed over his inability to cover the topic. He explained: \\"I just sat there thinking, 'We weren't allowed to do this, and now you guys are doing it.' That's something I regret.\\" Mary Harrington, a supervising producer of animation for Nickelodeon, described it as one of her favorite episodes of Rugrats, and commended the writers and producers for their handling of the subject matter. Broadcast history and release \\"Mother's Day\\", also promoted as \\"Rugrats Mother's Day Special\\", was originally broadcast in the United States at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 6, 1997 on Nickelodeon. The Los Angeles Times Lee Margulies recommended the special as appropriate for children between the ages of four and eight. The episode was one of several half-hour specials created for Rugrats, with others including \\"The Santa Experience\\" (1992), \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" (1993/1995) and \\"A Rugrats Chanukah\\" (1996). According to writer Jeff Lenburg, the show's specials, including \\"Mother's Day\\", earned high ratings. \\"Mother's Day\\" was featured on the VHS release Rugrats: Mommy Mania, which came out on January 4, 1998. It was included on the 2011 DVD package of the show's fourth season, with the press release listing it as one of the \\"special episodes\\". A writer from DVD Talk argued that the episode should also have been featured on the 2004 DVD release Rugrats Holiday Celebration given the lack of content on the collection's second disc. The releases were distributed by Viacom. On February 6, 2018, \\"Mother's Day\\" was released on the Rugrats: Season 4 DVD by Paramount Home Media Distribution. The episode was later made purchasable as a digital download on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video, along with the rest of the fourth season. It is also available on streaming video on demand services, such as Hulu. Critical response In 1998, Eric Schmuckler of The New York Times pointed to the \\"Mother's Day\\" special as an example of the show's balance between featuring an \\"always sunny and usually silly\\" tone while also being \\"poignant\\". Schmuckler described Chas' interactions with Chuckie as \\"an age-appropriate version of the loss of his mother\\". Rugrats was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards, after Nickelodeon submitted the special for consideration, but lost to The Simpsons. The episode was also nominated for the Humanitas Prize for the Children's Animation Category in 1998, which went to the Life with Louie episode \\"Blinded by Love\\". Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, and David N. Weiss received the CableACE Award for Writing a Children's Special or Series for their contributions to the episode. \\"Mother's Day\\" has been the subject of several retrospective reviews of the series. Philip Lewis of Arts.Mic praised the episode as an example of Nickelodeon's potential to cover a serious subject, noting its treatment of \\"the loss of a parent\\" as one of the series' most memorable moments. Moviepilot's Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as \\"[f]ew would have expected to be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies\\". In their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim, authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could \\"hit you like a truck if you let it\\". \\"Mother's Day\\" has been cited in several lists of commentators' favorite episodes or moments from Rugrats. Anderson placed it on her list of must-watch episodes from the show's third, fourth, and fifth seasons, suggesting that \\"[y]ou will need tissues\\". The poem written and narrated by Chuckie's mother was praised by Moviepilot's Daniel Pearson, and was included in a list of the top eight most heartfelt moments in animated television by Mara Mullikin of the same publication. Victor Beigelman of A Plus put the episode on his list of seven Mother's Day-themed television episodes, citing it as a \\"heavy dose of nostalgia\\". Critics have also commented on other aspects of the episode. In 2016, Caroline Bologna from The Huffington Post praised the episode for showing \\"a joyful depiction of breastfeeding\\" and for normalizing it to a wider audience. Bologna contrasted the scene with the lack of images of breastfeeding in contemporary children's television, writing that the show had a \\"positive legacy\\" and proved that \\"this topic was deemed perfectly suitable for a children's show 20 years ago\\". Priscilla Blossom of the motherhood website Romper.com also praised the scene as addressing reproductive health, along with the portrayal of Tommy's premature birth and time in a neonatal intensive care unit. In their 2013 essay \\"What Is a Mother? Gay and Lesbian Perspectives on Parenting\\", scholars Jack Drescher, Deborah F.

She is the creator of We Read Too, an iOS app that helps readers discover books for and by people of color. Thomas is a volunteer mentor with Black Girls Code and a Made with Code role model. Widely recognized for her work to improve diversity in the tech industry, she was honored in 2015 by Michelle Obama at BET's Black Girls Rock! award show and was named one of Glamour magazine's 2016 College Women of the Year. Early Life Thomas is originally from Staten Island, New York. In high school, Thomas was an avid reader and realized that there were not enough black girls in the young adult novels she was reading. She wished that there was a resource that would show books written by and for black girls and women. This experience would eventually be the inspiration for her app, We Read Too.  Education  Thomas graduated in 2017 from Dartmouth College, where she studied computer science. Initially enrolled in environmental engineering, she switched to computer science after teaching herself to code through Codecademy. She credits a TED Talk by Kimberly Bryant, founder of Black Girls Code, with sparking her interest in the tech industry. Thomas is particularly interested in the role technology can play in improving people's day-to-day lives.  Career and Awards  One of Thomas' first professional experiences was with Time Inc. as an intern with the Entertainment Weekly brand working on their mobile site. After she graduated from Dartmouth in 2017, Thomas worked full-time as an iOS engineer for Slack. Currently, she is working for Calm, a wellness company based in San Francisco, California. In 2015 Thomas was named a CODE2040 Fellow. The following year she was appointed a role model as part of Google's Made with Code initiative, which provides girls with coding support and training to encourage their entry into technology-based fields. She was also named one of Glamour's 2016 College Women of the Year.  Software  =We Read Too= Thomas began working on the iOS app We Read Too in 2014 while working as an intern at Time Inc. The app highlights books written by people of color featuring characters of color. Aimed at improving access to books for and by diverse communities, We Read Too helps young readers find books with protagonists they can relate to. The app is free to remove barriers to entry. This was made possible by crowdsourcing efforts. The idea for the app was based on Thomas' experience as a young reader who struggled to find diverse books. She explained to BET in 2014 that: \\"Whenever I tried to find books with characters of color, I would have to look in sub-categories or search longer than I should have had to. I created this app so that books created by and for people of color can be found easily and in one central location.\\" She was honored for her work on the app by Michelle Obama in 2015 as part of BET's Black Girls Rock! award show. As of April 2017 the app had been downloaded 15,000 times, and as of March 2020 its directory contains almost 1,000 titles. To achieve these numbers, Thomas launched an Indiegogo campaign in March of 2017 to achieve the goal of 1,000 listed titles featuring Black, Latinx, Native, Indigenous, Asian, and Pacific Islander characters. Part of the identified work was launching an Android version of the app and undertaking a redesign of the iOS version. By mid-April she had surpassed the initial goal of $10,000, indicating that additional funds would be put toward developing a website for the app and introducing fiction titles aimed at adults.  Public Speaking and Writing  In 2015 she spoke at BookNet Canada's 10th annual Tech Forum where she underscored the importance of children, from all backgrounds, being exposed to diverse book characters. She encouraged the traditionally white publishing industry to include ethnicity based metadata about authors to improve discoverability of diverse writers and publications. In addition to writing for various news sites, including TechCrunch and Modern View Culture, Thomas has appeared on podcasts Another Round and Code Newbie.  Volunteer Work  A volunteer mentor with Black Girls Code and the founder of the YouTube series Code With Kaya, Thomas is committed to helping women learn to code and promoting the diversification of both the tech and publishing industry.

It is contiguous with Glodwick and Alt. Lying on the eastern border of the historic Oldham township, Abbey Hills was the location of a large housing estate, the Abbey Hills Estate. It was built in the 1930s but was largely demolished during the late 1980s. History Until the early part of the 20th century the area around Abbey Hills was moorland and farmland. At this time it was still known by its archaic name, Wabbow Hills, centred around a farmstead, Wabbow Hills Farm. Other than minor development in the vicinity of Pitses, there was little change in the area until well into the 20th century. By 1922 the new Abbey Hills Road from Glodwick had reached a point just beyond its junction with the also new Manor Road, with Pitses and Alt still served by the old road running between the Moorhey area of Oldham and the industrial settlement of Park Bridge. The first major change to the area came in the 1930s with the building by Oldham Borough Council of the Abbey Hills Estate, laid out on Garden City principles on land north and south of Abbey Hills Road, which was then extended to meet Lees New Road, completing the modern‚Äìday route to Ashton. The estate was built right‚Äìup to what was then the administrative edge of the Borough of Oldham. Construction of the estate and the extension of Abbey Hills Road necessitated the demolition of Abbey Hills House (formerly Wabbow Hills). The Manor Inn, built by the Oldham Brewery in 1936‚Äì7, occupies a part of its site. The housing of the Abbey Hills Estate was built to a lower standard than earlier Council housing, add to which it was unpopular due to its isolated location. Families left and the estate became run‚Äìdown and neglected. Improvements were carried out between 1976 and 1978, though in 1988 nearly all of the 1930s houses south of Abbey Hills Road were demolished (the only survivals are those fronting the main road). The land was turned over to developers and new houses built in their stead, with the surviving lengths of road renamed.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iSRQ8LA- PacJ:www.oldham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1149/oldham_rochdale_hmr_pathfinder_heritage_assessment_- _alt+&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=uk Alt, Final Report 2008 Retrieved 7 December 2016 Transport First Greater Manchester provides service 425 to Holts Village and to Fitton Hill via Glodwick and Oldham.

He was one of the greatest orators of his day and a leader of African Americans in the southern United States. His death at the age of 39 cut short a career that might otherwise have vied with that of Booker T. Washington. Early life Joseph Charles Price was born free in Elizabeth City, North Carolina on February 10, 1854 to a slave father and a free mother. His mother was named Emily Pailin and his father was Charles Dozier, a ship's carpenter. Dozier was sold and sent to Baltimore and Emily married a man named David Price, whose name Joseph took. When he was nine, he moved with his mother to New Bern, North Carolina, which had become a haven to free blacks after it was occupied by the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861-1865). That year he enrolled at St. Andrew's School led by James Walker Hood, who would be an important influence upon Price. He also attended St. Cyprian Episcopal School, which was known as the Lowell Normal School of New Bern and was ran by the Boston Society.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p754-758 Early career In 1871 he began his career as a teacher in the public school of Wilson, North Carolina. After four years he enrolled at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. At Shaw he converted the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church and was granted a license to preach. He then enrolled in Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania to study classics. He graduated valedictorian from the classical department at Lincoln in 1879 and from the theology department in 1881. In 1880 he was a delegate to the M.E. General Conference in Montgomery, Alabama, and in September 1881 was a delegate to the Ecumenical Conference in London, England. He remained in England for one year raising money for the Zion Wesley Institute which would be used to help build Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina.

He was a delegate to the Centenary Conference of the ME Church in Baltimore in 1884 where he was one of three selected to give welcoming addresses along with Bishop James Osgood Andrew and Dr. John Berry McFerrin, and was chairman of the board of commissioners for Zion Church on forming a Union between the AME and the AME Zion church in Washington, DC in 1875.

He was also at one point nominated for a bishopric, which he also declined. In January 1890, Price was elected president of the Afro-American League at its founding convention in Chicago. He was elected chairman of the rival Equal Rights League in Washington, DC a month later. From July 10‚Äì12, 1890, the National Education Association annual meeting was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. At that meeting, white southerner A. A.

The expulsion of promotion rivals Angels on 2 February 2018 saw the club propelled from 4th to 2nd in the league, one point off unbeaten leaders Europa Point, without kicking a ball over the winter break. By mid March Fraser and Olympique found themselves leading the Gibraltar Second Division. A spot in the promotion playoff was secured on the final week of the season with a 1-0 win over Hound Dogs, courtesy of a late Max Bothen goal. Lewis at only the age of 24 has managed to guide Olympique 13 not only to their highest ever league finish (2nd) but also took the club the furthest it has ever been in the Rock Cup (Quarter Final). Personal life Lewis was brought up in the Scottish town of Musselburgh before moving to England as a teenager. He later attended Anglia Ruskin University where he studied Sport Science & Physical Education. During his time at University Lewis won the Sporting Excellence award 2 years in a row, becoming the first student to ever win it twice.

They studied grief in their work \\"The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade On\\". In this study, the models of coping were examined and how it could be of benefit compared to others. The authors came up with a dual process model to represent human grief. They explain coping with bereavement, a state of loss can be a combination of accepting and confronting it. It informs on how the combination of healthy emotional catharsis and changing perspective can be a good and healthy process to cope. Being able to confront the situation and also deal with everyday life events allows the person to live their lives with desired states of stability in a subjective post-loss world in which bereaved persons find themselves (Parkes, 1993). Coping Bereavement and the adjective bereaved are derived from a verb, 'reave', which means \\"to despoil, rob, or forcibly deprive\\" according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Thus, a bereaved person is one who has been deprived, robbed, plundered, or stripped of someone or something that they valued. Reaction to this state or impact of loss is called grief. According to Lazarus and Folkman (1984), coping strategies are the \\"constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing on or exceeding the resources of the person\\". People vary in the ways that they grieve and also in the way that they cope. But, acknowledging it and allowing themselves to go through the motions will allow them to cope in a healthy way. To cope with the loss, the person requires to relearn the world around them and simultaneously make a multifaceted transition from loving in presence to loving in absence (Attig, 2001). A healthy relocation of the deceased internally and maintaining a healthy dynamic connectedness/relationship is observed to provide solace to the grieving, but the weightage differed in pluralistic cultural settings. Grievers will go through times of extreme sadness and also times where they are numb to what has happened. Lack of appropriate coping can bring many ailments to a person including mental and physical ailments. Coping through mourning in a state of bereavement is advised in the Bible as \\"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.\\"Matthew 5:4, NRSV Because it helps to achieve growth through thorough acceptance of loss, the transforming capacity of profound human experiences. Freud, in 1959, in an article, called this a process of \\"working through\\" the grief. Healthy coping is achieved when the bereaved person is enabled to go forward with healthy, productive living by effortfully developing \\"new normals\\" to guide that living which is characterized by lesser stressful demands compared to the initial phase of grief. Greenblatt has reviewed spousal mourning as being essential for transition. He describes four phases of mourning: the initial reaction of shock, numbness, denial and disbelief; followed by pining, yearning, depression then in a healthy environment resolution phase begins with emancipation from the loved one and readjustment to the new environment. Dual process model =Loss oriented= The loss oriented process focuses on coping with bereavement, the loss itself, recognizing it and accepting it. In this process a person will express feelings of grief with all the losses that occur from losing their loved one. There will be many changes from work to family and friendships. There might also be demographic changes and even economic ones. During this time, people either acknowledge these changes head on or ruminate on feelings of loss which might lead to distorted, complicated or prolonged grief. The loss oriented process will bring on a lot of yearning, irritability, despair, anxiety and depression. During this process they are only concentrated on their pain that this loss has caused. Lack or denial of early adaptive acknowledgement that they will no longer speak to deceased or see them again might instigate compulsive and self-destructive behaviors. People attached with the deceased have to reconfigure their identity as an autonomous being. These processes in a non-resilient griever can appear overwhelming, and associated guilt can be exported over friends and family in an assumptive effort which might affect interpersonal relationships. =Restoration oriented= In restoration-oriented process, the loss of the loved one is accepted and attachments with the deceased are relinquished. These include focusing on the new roles in their post loss reality and responsibilities in lives. The restoration-oriented process incorporates endurance through reconstruction of perspective by taking over grief; grieving thoughts are adjusted adaptively by creating new meanings with the deceased. The restoration process is a confrontation process that allows the person to adjust to a world without the deceased. People in this process can feel subjective oscillations of pride and grief related stressors in the avoidance mentalization. This process allows the person to live their daily life as a changed individual without being consumed by the grieving they are facing. William Worden calls this the four tasks of grief. Therese A. Rando calls the letting go process as emancipation from bondage due to the strength required for change and recovery. Conclusion The dual process model of coping takes into consideration that everyone will have stressful life events while they are coping with bereavement. Their lives will continue and so will the problems associated with it. There will be many situations that will take them away from grieving. These situations can either benefit them or affect them negatively if they allow them to. Being aware and prepared to change can allow them to continue and deal with post-loss life events.

After finishing second on his only start as a juvenile in 2001 he improved to become a top-class stayer in the following year. After winning two minor races in spring he was narrowly beaten in the Queen's Vase and the Northumberland Plate before recording his first major win in the Prix Berteux. In the autumn he finished only fifth in the St Leger but then won the Group One Prix Royal-Oak. He reached his peak in the first half of 2003 when he won the Henry II Stakes and then recorded an emphatic, six-length victory in the Gold Cup. His subsequent career was dogged by injury problems and he never won again, retiring from racing in 2005 with a record of six wins and five placings from seventeen starts. He has made little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Mr Dinos is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by the County Tipperary-based Mocklerstown House Stud. As a yearling he was sent to the Goffs sale in October 2000 and was bought for IR¬£40,000 by Emerald Bloodstock. In the following April he was sent to England for the Tattersalls \\"breeze-up\\" sale, for which horses are galloped in public before being auctioned. He was bought for 42,000 guineas by the trainer Paul Cole. Throughout his racing career Mr Dinos was owned by the Cypriot businessman Constantinos Shiacolas and trained by Cole at the Whatcombe Estate near Wantage in Oxfordshire. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Desert King, an Irish horse who won the Irish Derby in 1997. As a breeding stallion he fathered several major winners and is best known as the sire of the outstanding Australian-trained racemare Makybe Diva. Mr Dinos's dam Spear Dance was an unraced mare who produced several other winners including Risk Material who won the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial in 1998. She was a descendant of the British broodmare Amorelle (foaled in 1919), making her a distant relative of The Oaks winner Homeward Bound. Racing career =2001: two-year-old season= Mr Dinos made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 27 July 2001. Starting a 14/1 outsider in a six runner-field he raced in second place for most of the way before finishing runner-up, beaten a neck by the odds-on favourite Sohaib. =2002: three-year-old season= After an absence of eight months Mr Dinos returned in an eleven furlong maiden at Kempton Park Racecourse on 1 April in which he started favourite but finished third behind Mawaheb and Dileer, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner. He recorded his first success two weeks later in a maiden over one and a half miles at Newmarket Racecourse, taking the lead three furlongs out and winning by four lengths from the Barry Hills-trained Lakatoi. The colt was stepped up in distance at York Racecourse in May and started the 11/8 favourite against three opponents for a minor stakes race over one and three quarter miles. Ridden by Kevin Darley he took the lead five furlongs from the finish and kept on strongly in the closing stages to win by two lengths. At Royal Ascot on 21 June Mr Dinos was moved up in class and distance to contest the Group Three Queen's Vase over two miles and started second favourite behind the Irish challenger Black Sam Bellamy. He was amongst the leaders from the start before staying on in the straight and finished second, beaten half a length by Mamool, with Ancestor a length away in third. Eight days after his run at Ascot, the colt was matched against older horses in the Northumberland Plate a handicap race over one and three quarter miles at Newcastle Racecourse. Assigned a weight of 115 pounds he was ridden by the lightweight jockey Franny Norton and was made the 3/1 favourite against fifteen rivals. Mr Dinos took the lead half a mile from the finish and fought back after being overtaken to finish second in a photo finish, beaten a head by the six-year-old gelding Bangalore. Four weeks later Mr Dinos was sent to France for the Group Three Prix Berteux over 3000 metres at Vichy. Ridden by Gerald Mosse, he took the lead from the start, quickly opened up a clear lead won \\"easily\\" by the and a half lengths from the filly Ivy League. After the race Paul Cole explained \\"He had to do it the hard way. We didn't want to mess around and let him get swooped on by his rivals ‚Äì we killed them off instead\\". On 14 September Mr Dinos was one of eight three-year-olds to contest the classic St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead after a quarter mile and led the field until the final turn but faded in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Bollin Eric, Highest, Bandari and Mamool. Cole later commented that the colt \\"went too fast\\" in the race. On 27 October the colt returned to France for the Group One Prix Royal-Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was ridden by the French jockey Dominique Boeuf. He was made the 3.6/1 third choice in the betting behind the Andr√© Fabre-trained pair Morozov (Prix Hubert de Chaudenay) and Bernimixa (Prix de Pomone) whilst the other runners included Sulk and Cut Quartz (Prix Kergorlay). As in his previous French race he took the lead from the start and soon opened up a clear lead. He kept on well in the straight and won by two lengths from Sulk with a gap of four lengths back to Morozov in third. His victory made him the first British-trained winner of the race since Moonax triumphed in 1994. After the race Boeuf commented \\"I controlled the race from start to finish. Mr Cole told me to go on if no-one else did, but not to make the pace too quick... he ran on again in the final furlong\\". =2003: four-year-old season= Mr Dinos began his third campaign in the Group Two Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park Racecourse on 26 May in which he was ridden by Frankie Dettori. He started 6/1 second favourite behind the Doncaster Cup winner Boreas with the other runners including Persian Punch, Bangalore and Hugs Dancer (Ebor Handicap). After racing in third place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Pole Star and Kasthari. Dettori, who was contracted to ride Mamool in the season's major staying events said of the winner \\"I like him a lot. That was a tremendous performance first time out. He's done well over the winter. He's going to be very hard to get by. We will give him a big race but he must be a big danger in the Gold Cup.\\" Mr Dinos was then aimed, as expected, at the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles. The build-up to the race was exceptionally difficult for Paul Cole as seventy percent of the horses at Whatcombe were affected by a viral infection and Mr Dinos had to be kept in isolation, attended only by his stable lad Tom Pirie. Kieren Fallon took over the ride in Gold Cup 19 June and Mr Dinos started 3/1 second favourite behind his old rival Mamool. Black Sam Bellamy, Pole Star, Kasthari and Persian Punch were again in the field whilst the other runners were Fight Your Corner (Chester Vase), Tholjanah (Noel Murless Stakes), Jardines Lookout (Goodwood Cup), Savannah Bay (Prix de Lut√®ce), Pugin (runner-up in the Irish St Leger) and Alcazar. Persian Punch set the pace with Mr Dinos settling third before moving up into second place with nine furlongs left to run. Fallon sent the colt into the lead three furlongs out and Mr Dinos \\"forged clear\\" in the straight to win \\"easily\\" by six lengths from Persian Punch. After the race Fallon said \\"I rode a horse who could take me there. He travelled well, he travelled all the way, even though he was a bit lazy. When I switched him on he found another gear and that's the sign of a good horse\\". Cole commented \\"I've never had a runner in the Gold Cup and it's a race I've always wanted to win. I can't believe it's happened. We've had a terrible six weeks and we isolated him, and we've taken every single possible move to stop him getting the virus. It means a lot to everybody\\". Mr Dinos was off the course for three and a half months before returning for the Group One Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres at Longchamp on 5 October. He started the 8/11 favourite but after reaching third place in the straight he could make no further progress and finished sixth behind Westerner. =2004: five-year-old season= On his first run of 2004 Mr Dinos started joint-favourite for the Yorkshire Cup on 13 May but finished fourth, nine lengths behind the winner Millenary. As in 2003, the horse prepared for the Gold Cup with a run in the Henry II Stakes and started 2/1 favourite under top weight of 131 pounds. He finished second to the four- year-old Papineau (carrying 124 pounds) but appeared somewhat unlucky as he was hampered when the winner hung to the right in the final furlong. Fallon claimed that he and Mr Dinos would have won the race had they not been \\"stopped in our tracks\\". In the Gold Cup at Ascot on 17 June Mr Dinos, with Fallon in the saddle, started 5/4 favourite ahead of Papineau, Westerner, Brian Boru and Royal Rebel. After tracking the leaders Fallon sent the favourite into the lead three furlongs out, but Mr Dinos faded in the straight and finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Papineau. After the race Cole reported that the horse was \\"very sore\\" and \\"jarred-up\\" after racing on the \\"lightning-fast\\" ground and added \\"I'll be more careful where I run him in future\\". In fact Mr Dinos did not race again in 2004. =2005: six-year-old season= Mr Dinos remained in training as a six-year-old but failed to regain his old form. After an absence of a year he started a 20/1 outsider for the 2005 \\"Ascot\\" Gold Cup which was run at York and never looked likely to win, finishing eighth behind Westerner. He was then dropped in class for the Listed Esher Stakes over two miles at Sandown on 2 July. After racing in second place for most of the way he dropped away in the straight and finished fifth of the seven runners. He suffered further injury problems and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Cole said that the horse was never the same after the 2004 Gold Cup and added \\"He's a horse who owes us nothing, and the best thing to do is retire him\\". Stud record Mr Dinos was retired from racing to become a National Hunt breeding stallion at the Tally-Ho Stud in County Westmeath. He has signed a few minor winners from his early crops but is yet to make any real impact. In 2011 he was moved to the County Kilkenny-based Whytemount Stud where he stood at a fee of 1000 euros in 2016. Assessment and awards In the International Classification for 2003 Nr Dinos was rated the 49th best horse in the world with a rating of 119. In the inaugural edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Mr Dinos was given a rating of 117, making the 57th best racehorse in the world. Paul Cole described Mr Dinos as \\"strong, tough and blessed with the most amazing temperament\\" and \\"the best stayer I ever trained\\". Pedigree *Mr Dinos was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

His works were characterized by depictions of biblical figures and were typically highly influenced by German Romanticism. Biography Huebel was born in Limba≈æi as the son of the fine art woodworker August Gotthilf Heubel (1760‚Äì1846) and his wife Juliane Marie, n√©e Geywitz (d. 1831). He started painting at an early age, studying first for his father and later in Tartu and Riga. Heubel came to Riga in 1829 where he took lessons from the painter Georg Heinrich B√ºttner. Through the patronage of the Baltic German councillor in Riga, Friedrich Wilhelm Brederlo, he was able to travel to Germany and Italy to study in Dresden, D√ºsseldorf and Rome. In the autumn of 1832 he moved to Dresden together with Johann Karl B√§hr to enter the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1834 he went to D√ºsseldorf, where he studied for Eduard Bendemann and Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow. In 1841 he went with his fellow student Ludwig Haach to Rome. He returned to Latvia, his native country, weak and sickly in 1845. He died from tuberculosis two years later, at the age of 33, in Riga. Influences Moses, Aaron and Hur, Latvian National Museum of Art, 1837 Heubel was much influenced by the German Romanticism of the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. He mainly focused on religious themes and depicted various biblical scenes. Several of his works are in the collections of the Latvian National Museum of Art. His painting of the Holy Family was recovered by the museum in 2012 after having been missing for 20 years after being stolen. Works Among his works are a scene depicting Moses, supported by Aaron and Hur at the victory over the Amalekites at the Battle of Rephidim (1837) in the collections of the Latvian National Museum of Art; a biblical depiction of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego being thrown into the fiery furnace (1841‚Äì44) commissioned in Rome by the Empress consort of Russia Alexandra Feodorovna and later hung at Ropsha Palace; an altarpiece at St. James's Cathedral in Riga of the Ascension of Christ (1845); a depiction of Job and his three friends, painted in D√ºsseldorf; a study of the head of an old man, once in the Brederlo Gallery.

The flagship toys feature a robotic creature‚Äîrepresenting one of various species‚Äîthat \\"hatch\\" themselves from an egg. After their initial release in October 2016, the toys faced an unexpectedly high demand. Media outlets expected them to be the top seller of the holiday season, leading to raffles and waiting lists over the limited stock, and comparisons to other major toy phenomenons such as Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo.  History  In 2014, Spin Master's head of robotics James Martin explained that his team hated the popularity of unboxing videos on YouTube, and envisioned a concept for a toy that could \\"unbox\\" itself. This idea evolved into a concept for a robotic creature that would hatch itself from an egg, necessitating the design of a mechanism for the hatching, and a material for the egg itself. Hatchimals was officially launched on October 7, 2016, backed by advertising on television and digital platforms, such as social networking services. On launch, five possible species were available: Bearakeet, Burtle, Draggle, Penguala, and Owlicorn. In 2017, Spin Master introduced Hatchimals Colleggtibles, a line of miniature, collectible figures in a blind bag form.  Demand  On launch, demand for Hatchimals was extremely high, which led to them being designated as the \\"hottest\\" toy of the 2016 Christmas shopping season. By late-October, Hatchimals occupied multiple spots on NPD Group's top ten list of best-selling toys in the United States, including first, second, sixth, and ninth place. The firm compared the phenomenon to those surrounding Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo. The New York Times and The Globe and Mail documented the organisation of raffles and waiting lists for the toys, and sellers on websites such as Amazon.com and eBay selling Hatchimals at over three times their suggested retail price of US$60, if not higher. The high demand made defects with some of the toys more prominent, with some customers complaining that they had issues initiating the hatching process (which involves interacting with the egg over a period of time), or that the batteries in the toy within did not have enough capacity left to complete it (necessitating manual extraction). The company did acknowledge that some customers had difficulty with the hatching, stating that it had increased the capacity and business hours of its customer care call centres, and had posted tips and tutorials online to assist in the process. Martin Prominent lawyer Mark Geragos backed a lawsuit over Hatchimals, alleging that Spin Master purposely intended the toy to not operate successfully all the time, causing disappointment and frustration among the parents who made great lengths to purchase it for the holidays. Spin Master was caught off-guard by the unexpected demand; the company originally stated that the toy would appeal primarily to girls aged 6 to 8, but Hatchimals ultimately became popular among boys and older youth audiences as well. The company attempted to address the supply issues by having its remaining stock from China delivered via air freight instead of by ship, but stated that there may not be new stock of Hatchimals until 2017. However, Martin added that the company planned to introduce new species and features to the Hatchimals line, and asked customers to be patient.

Context In 1812 Samuel Clark and James Mart(sic) constructed a machine that was capable of working a pattern and net at the same time. A pusher operated each bobbin and carriage independently allowing almost unlimited designs and styles. The machine however was slow, delicate, costly and could produce only short \\"webs\\" of about two by four yards. There is no record of the original specifications, but it origin is referenced in two patent applications made to improve it lodged in 1825, by Joseph Crowder of New Radford and his associates Messrs Hall and Day. Variations on the basic machine were the Crowder and Day's improved pusher and Kendall and Morley's machine. The machine was modified by John Synyer in 1829. to allow for bullet holes to be inserted in the plain twist net. A modification was made in 1831 to copy blondes, Marmaduke Miller adder a device to add loops and purls to the lace in 1827. Production had its heyday in the 1850s and ceased around 1870-1880. Machine The warp beam was at the top, and the work roller at the bottom. There was a sley and a guide bar. The carriages with their bobbins (brass bobbins) slid on a concave comb (bolt). In the 1825 modification, the carriages were suspended from an upwardly arching comb. The carriages are propelled by individual pusher rods which strike the ears on the carriage. There was pusher bar (later there were four) but there is a fetcher bar (locker bar) which act in conjunctions with the pushers. It was slow and in the early machine, 14 actions were required to form each course; in 1825 this had been reduced to ten. The bobbins were necessarily small and this restricted the length of a single piece to about 4 metres. The actions were controlled by an organ barrel until the adoption of the Jacquard process in 1839. This was achieved by James Wright of Radford. Product The bobbinet was best producing straight net, but the Pusher was slow and could be used to imitate handlace of any complexity though could't put in liners leaving the impression of sharpness from the lace. When in William IV reign, tatting and putting on fancies became popular, the Pusher was in great demand. The pusher was particularly good at making large shawls or capes in the style of Chantilly lace. It could replicate the grille or half-stitch which defeated the Leavers machine. It could be hand lined using a Cornely machine. Lace was dependent on fashion. In 1867 women stopped wearing shawls, and the Franco-Prussian War cut off the trade with France there was market for this lace. The redundant Pushers were scrapped. In 1920, a retailer was advertising 'Real Alen√ßon' machine lace produced on a Pusher in Lyon, France and in 1959 there were a 'narrow range of silk nets' being produced on Pushers in Lyon.

History Funds were raised for it by Henri Simon, publisher of the L'√âcho de Paris newspaper, who raised around 100,000 Francs. This paid for gifts to reward Anatoly Stessel, the Russian commander at Port Arthur, and for the medals' manufacture and delivery. However, whilst the charity was organising for the medals to be collected, delivered and stamped in Russia, Stessel was put on trial for his surrender of Port Arthur. This substantially affected the course of the medal's history - it was not a Russian state award to the defenders of Port Arthur, although a silver issue of a later Russo-Japanese War Medal was struck for them. Later, on the tenth anniversary of the siege, the Port Arthur Cross was established. Eligibility and wearing Gilded silver medals were issued to officers, silver to non commissioned officers and bronze for ordinary sailors, soldiers, nurses, port workers and others involved in the defence. Direct heirs of those killed in the siege could also apply for a medal. After Stessel's trial, the medals were kept in storage for a long while at Russia's Naval Ministry. It was eventually decided to distribute them, on the condition that a medal holder could only wear it if he or she personally paid for Stessel's name to be removed from it. Most recipients declined to do this and so from 1 December 1910 they were issued but with no right to wear them.

History The Marina Nazionale Repubblicana was formally created in late September 1943, following the establishment of the Italian Social Republic. Most of the Regia Marina fleet, however, after the Armistice of Cassibile between Italy and the Allies on 3 September 1943, had sailed to Allied-controlled ports (chiefly Malta),Robert Wallace & the editors of Time-Life Books, The Italian Campaign, Time-Life Books Inc, 1978. p.57 and the few ships that remained in Italian ports, most of them undergoing maintenance or repair, were either scuttled or captured by the German forces and incorporated into the Kriegsmarine. The MNR was thus left without a real fleet; even ships abandoned during construction in Northern Italian shipyards (among them many Gabbiano-class corvettes and Ariete-class torpedo boats) were completed for the German Kriegsmarine, that refused to transfer any of them to the MNR.Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, p. 297.Achille Rastelli, Sommergibili a Singapore, p. 160. The first Chief of Staff of the MNR was Admiral Antonio Legnani, who however died in a car crash less than a month after the creation of the MNR. He was succeeded by Captain Ferruccio Ferrini. Junio Valerio Borghese's Decima Flottiglia MAS was formally part of the MNR, but it operated as a de facto independent unit under Borghese's undisputed leadership. Ferrini did not tolerate this independence; he accused Borghese of having contacts with the Allies and the anti-Communist partisans, and of conspiring to depose Mussolini and replace him at the head of the RSI. In January 1944 Borghese was summoned by Mussolini and placed under arrest, but this immediately brought the Decima MAS personnel on the verge of mutiny; the situation settled after Borghese was released, following German intervention.Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, pp. 318 to 322. The fleet of the MNR never amounted to more than a small number of MAS, submarine chasers, midget submarines and assault craft, the latter operated by the Decima Flottiglia MAS. Part of the personnel recruited by the MNR served on Kriegsmarine ships in the Mediterranean, whereas others manned coastal batteries in Northern Italy. Other personnel fought on land along side the National Republican Army and the Wehrmacht Size and ships The Marina Nazionale Repubblicana only reached a twentieth the size of the Allied Italian fleet,Page 100, \\"The Armed Forces of World War II\\", Andrew Mollo, and consisted of nine motor torpedo boats (two large and seven small), dozens of MTSM small motor torpedo boats and MTM explosive motorboats.Spencer C. Tucker, World War II at Sea: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia, p. 389 The National Republican Navy also operated fifteen CB- class midget submarines (ten in the Adriatic and five in the Black Sea) and one larger submarine, CM 1,Jack Greene, Alessandro Massignani, The Black Prince and the Sea Devils: The Story of Valerio Borghese and the elite units of the Decima MAS, p.42 as well as the auxiliary submarine chasers Equa and Antonio Landi, the trawlers Cefalo and Pegaso, and a flotilla of minesweepers based in Venice.Enrico Cernuschi, La marina repubblicana 1943-1945 parte 1, in Storia Militare n¬∞ 188-May 2009, page 45. thumb An unknown number of MTSMs were active with the navy of the Italian Social Republic.

Of their CB midget class submarines, five were initially given to the Italian Social Republic by Germany,Jamie Prenatt and Mark Stille, Axis midget submarines p. 15 but later ten more boats were transferred by the Germans to the RSI Navy and served in the Adriatic. One was used for spare parts, seven were sunk and two were captured by the Allies.W. M. Thornton, Submarine Insignia and Submarine Services of the World Operational history Due to its small size, activity by MNR mainly consisted in coastal patrolling and minelaying operations, as well as some limited offensive activity against Allied shipping with MAS and assault craft.Enrico Cernuschi, La marina repubblicana 1943-1945 parte 1, in Storia Militare n¬∞ 188-May 2009, page 46.

A TIF is a rare but life-threatening iatrogenic injury, usually the sequela of a tracheotomy.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms include hemoptysis, and/or massive hemorrhage which result from the formation of a fistula between the trachea and the brachiocephalic artery. The primary threat is respiratory compromise leading to dyspnea and cyanosis. Patients can later present with hypovolemic shock which include symptoms of tachycardia, cyanosis, cold and clammy skin, dizziness, confusion, and fatigue. Patients may also develop sepsis.  Causes  The innominate artery usually crosses the trachea at the ninth cartilage ring, however this can vary from the sixth to the thirteenth cartilage ring in patients. A TIF runs between the trachea and the innominate artery. Through this connection blood from within the artery may pass into the trachea or alternatively air from within the trachea may cross into the artery. TIF is a late complication of a tracheotomy and is associated with prolonged endotracheal intubation, as a result of cuff over inflation or a poorly positioned tracheostomy tube. Over inflation of the cuff causes the tracheostomy tube to erode into the posterior aspect of the innominate artery leading to the formation of a fistula. The pathogenesis of an TIF by the aforementioned method is pressure necrosis by tracheostomy tube on the tracheal wall. An TIF can also occur due to innominate artery injury as a result of an bronchoscopy. Patients whose tracheotomies are placed beneath the third tracheal ring cartilage and patients with innominate arteries crossing higher on the trachea have an increased risk of developing an TIF. Other factors contributing to the development of TIF include steroids, which weaken the endotracheal mucosa, episodes of hypotension in which the pressure in the tracheostomy tube exceeds that of the endotracheal mucosa, and radiation therapy. An endotracheal tumor can mimic a TIF and present with massive bleeding during a rigid bronchoscopy.  Diagnosis  Two-thirds of TIF occurs within three weeks of a tracheotomy. A TIF should be on the top of the differential diagnosis in patients with a tracheostomy followed by bleeding. Most effective diagnostic tool is a rigid bronchoscopy, although this may be unnecessary as a massive arterial hemorrhage from the tracheostomy likely indicates the formation of an TIF. However, a rigid brochoscopy can clear the tracheobronchial tree of aspirated blood and may be used to terminate blood flow. Only 35% of TIF patients exhibit the pathognomonic warning signs which include sentinel bleeding, a small bleed from the tracheostomy in the preceding the TIF, and pulsations of the tracheostomy tube that coincides with the heartbeat.  Prevention  To prevent an TIF, intubation time should be limited to less than 2 weeks and proper techniques should be used when performing tracheotomies. The occurrence of an TIF can be reduced by using more flexible and blunt tracheostomy tubes and insuring that the tubes are properly aligned in the patients. Placing the tracheostomy between the second and third tracheal rings can minimize the risk of an TIF. Repetitive head movements, especially, hyperextension of the neck should be avoided as since this movement results in contact between the innominate artery and the underside of the tube.  Treatment  The formation of a TIF is a medical emergency and requires immediate intervention. Blood volume control, management of the hemorrhage, and adequate oxygenation should be insured in these patients. In a majority of TIF cases (85%), hyperinflation of the tracheostomy cuff will control the bleeding, while the patient is prepared for surgery. However, if this fails the tracheostomy cuff must be removed, and the patient must be intubated from above. Next, pressure from the index finger can be applied on the bleeding site from within the tracheostomy to control the bleeding. In addition, the \\"Utley Maneuver\\", which involves digital compression of the artery against the posterior wall of the manubrium of the sternum following a right infraclavicular incision, may be used to urgently control the bleeding When the bleeding is controlled the patient should be immediately transferred on the operating room. = Surgery = A sternal saw and a rigid bronchoscopy is used during the operation. During the operation, a median sternotomy is performed in order to expose and ligate the involved artery above and below the fistula. Division of the thymus and superior retraction of the innominate vein exposes the innominate artery. The innominate artery should be debrided to healthy tissue and closed with a monofilament suture. Next, the damaged segments of the trachea and the artery should be excised followed by reconstruction with a primary end to end anastomosis of the trachea. Innominate artery ligation leaves the carotid and subclavian circulations intact. Pulsatile back-bleeding from distal innominate artery stump should be checked to insure collateral circulation. In patients with poor pulsatile back-bleeding, an aorta-axillary artery bypass graft can be considered in patients with severe occlusion of the left common carotid artery, severe atherosclerosis, and brain ischemic or hemorrhagic insults. In addition, an autologous vein bypass between the aorta and the carotid artery or the opposite carotid artery and the subclavian artery may be performed to restore normal circulation. The interposition of viable tissue facilitates tracheal wall repair. Thus, vascularized tissues such as the thymus, strap muscles, the sternocleidomastoid, or the pectoralis major muscle should be interposed between tracheal defect and the vessel stumps to prevent bleeding, seal the mediastinum, fill dead space, cover major vital structures, provide a blood supply and venous drainage, and increase the concentration of antibiotics. Innominate artery ligation has a 10% risk of neurological deficit.  Prognosis  TIF is a rare condition with a .7% frequency, and an mortality rate approaching 100% without surgical intervention. Immediate diagnosis and intervention of an TIF is critical for the surgical intervention success. 25-30% of TIF patients who reach the operating room survive. Recently, the incidence of TIF may have declined due to advances in tracheostomy tube technology and the introduction of the bedside percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT).

The pier table takes its English name from the \\"pier wall\\", the space between windows. The table was developed in continental Europe in the 1500s and 1600s, and became popular in England in the last quarter of the 1600s. The pier table became known in North America in the mid-1700s, and was a popular item into the mid to late 1800s. It was common for the space between the rear legs of the pier table to contain a mirror, or \\"pier glass\\", to help hide the wall. Later pier tables were designed to stand in any niche in a room, and the pier glass moved above the table. The pier table may often be semicircular, the flat edge against the wall. Pier tables from later periods are often large and quite ornate. Well-known designers such as Duncan Phyfe, Robert Adam, George Hepplewhite, and Thomas Sheraton all designed and manufactured notable examples of pier tables.

Language Almost nothing is known directly about Yiman, because the tribe was thought to have been wiped out before any words could be recorded. Society Yiman people persist as they have for tens of thousands of years. While little may be known to the general public about Yiman social structure, Yiman people survive and thrive. Their territory borders Wuli Wuli, Wadjigu, Garingbul, Gungabula, Mandandanji and Barunggam language regions. In a settler crusade to hunt them down, in late 1857, many of the Yiman victims killed were examined to see if they bore on their chests the distinct boomerang design typical of the Yiman thought responsible for the Fraser family massacre. History Records of the Yiman mainly concern the Hornet Bank massacre which took place on 27 October 1857. The incident took at a site known as \\"Goongarry\\" which had been squatted by the Scottish immigrant Andrew Scott who had applied for a tender over this area of Yiman traditional land in late 1853. It has been assumed, on the basis of settler practice, that Scott had occupied this stretch of territory at least a year before that date. Though Scott's tender was approved four years later, he leased the property to a shipwright John Fraser in March 1854. Fraser died later that year of pneumonia, and the lease was continued by his wife, 5 sons and 4 daughters, who, disregarding Scott's advice not to allow blacks anywhere near the holding, befriended the local Yiman, since they had experience earlier of friendly aboriginal hands on various stations on the Darling Downs. The family also employed a tutor Mr. Neagle. According to the account of the sole survivor Sylvester Fraser who managed to hide after being skulled by a nulla nulla, they had been attacked either at dawn or according to other accounts just as the full moon rose, by roughly 100 tribesmen. The 3 oldest girls were raped before being killed. One other of the Frazer family survived: William who was away in Ipswich. Judging from one report, it is possible some Mandandanji also joined in the attack. It may well be that the Yiman, according to Gordon Reid, were just one of a confederation of tribes involved, and not the only perpetrators. =Pursuing the Yiman= The day after Walter Powell, and his native police tracked down and ambushed one of about 10 bands believed to be responsible, the only one thought to have moved westwards, killing 5 and wounding several others. In a second incident, Powell and his troops, joined by William Fraser, killed 3 men and 3 woman near Carrabah station, on 27 November. Some days later, they, now joined by Second- Lieutenant Robert Walker killed another 7 natives at Jundah station, though the Jundah station manager maintained they hadn't been involved. Then the group murdered 11 other Aborigines to the east, in the vicinity of Cockatoo station. Tracking suspected participants hailing from the Baking Board district, west of Chinchilla, they came across a band of Aborigines at Redbank, rounded them up and killed them over the protests of the local Ross family. Settlers noticed aboriginals shifting their grounds, seeking security in the Auburn and Burnet districts. Settlers from the Upper Dawson and these areas organized a settler vigilante 'crusade in December, which lasted 6 weeks, during which an estimated 80 more Aborigines were killed in several camps. The flight of the Yiman deep into the Auburn and Burnet districts suggest they had traditional ties with native groups indigenous to this region. Taking a lead from linguistic research by Nils Holmer, it appears that the band dispersal betrays evidence that the Upper Dawson people were part of the Wakka Wakka western division of a linguistic grouping that extended also to the dominant Kabi Kabi of the Wide Bay area. A guerilla war ensued for some 18 months. In January 1858. 200-300 Aborigines launched a night attack on a group with the magistrate William Wiseman, on the road between Rannes and the Gracemere station. The assault failed, but Wiseman blamed the Upper Dawson tribes. After the killing of 4 settlers in April, 60 tribesmen attacked In July 1858 50 to 60 Aborigines attacked Henry Gregory's Gwambagwyne station, near Taroom. In the reprisals by settlers in the district and native police upwards of 300 Yiman were hunted down and killed, and the executioners were not subject to prosecution. According to Gordon Reid, the manner of reprisal contributed to setting the pattern governing government policy and settler attitudes towards the indigenous peoples of Queensland down to the end of the 19th century. Years later, Steele Rudd's father, Thomas Davis recalled riding through the scrubland and sighting \\"the bleaching bones of the dead blacks strewn here and there - a gruesome sight - full-ribbed bodies, fleshless arms, disjointed leg-bones and ghastly grinning skulls peeping out of the grass.\\" =Recent history= The Iman had not been wiped out. In 1998, they filed an application with the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) for recognition of native title to their homeland. On 14 September 2015, an agreement was entered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements by the NNTT. It related to an area of approximately about north-east of Roma. On 23 June 2016, the case was concluded when John Reeves, J. of the Federal Court, sitting in Taroom, approved a consent decree. The judge said that the court order did not grant the Iman native title; instead, it recognised their pre-existing title; and their continuing connection to the land, despite its being 150 years since they were forced into hiding. The same day, Anthony Lynham, Minister for State Development and Minister for Natural Resources and Mines in the Government of Queensland, welcomed the outcome.

Volcanic ash aggregation occurs when particles of volcanic ash collide and stick together during transport. This process modifies the size distribution of airborne particles, which affects both atmospheric dispersal and fallout patterns on the ground. Aggregation also impacts the dynamics of volcanic plumes, pyroclastic density currents, and their associated hazards.  Numerical models  There are two main approaches to include the effects of ash aggregation in numerical models of ash injection and dispersal. One is to initialize the model with an aggregated grain size distribution, by moving fractions of the erupted mass into larger size bins (for example, the Cornell model). A second approach is a full theoretical description of aggregate growth through time, based on the Smoluchowski coagulation equation. Several methods exist to deal with this equation, including continuous and discrete methods. Continuous methods use the method of moments to track the evolution of a continuous grain size distribution, typically represented by a mean and standard deviation. In contrast, discrete methods use a discretized (binned) grain size distribution. Areas of uncertainty in the numerical schemes include parameterization of the particle sticking efficiency, timescales over which aggregation occurs, and the fraction of erupted mass participating in the aggregation process.

Pornography in North Korea is strictly forbidden. The production, distribution and importation of pornography is punished harshly by the government. Nevertheless, pornography is widespread in the country because people secretly import it, or locally produce it. The possession of it first became popular amongst elites during the late 1990s, when Kim Jong-il was the leader of the country. High ranking political and military officials were the most active consumers of pornography. Today, pornography is sold openly on the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border despite the governments attempts to curtail circulation. Most of the content consumed in North Korea is produced outside the country, with a significant part of it being Chinese bootleg recordings of poor quality. A locally produced pornographic film typically involves nude or scantily clad women dancing to music. Habits Sexuality is restricted in the conservative North Korean culture. Some defectors say that the lack of sex education in the country results in young people learning about sex through pornography, and also that adults watch less pornography than young people. Showing an interest in pornography may make one subject to the country's mass surveillance network. Pornographic magazines and films sold at black markets are distributed as CDs called \\"Sex-R\\" (sex CD-R) and are arranged by video quality, which is mostly poor due to most of them being cheap bootleg recordings from China. Markets and distribution methods continue to develop. Unauthorized sale of pornography takes place, for instance, at the Tongil Market of Pyongyang. On the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border pornography is traded in the open. Exposure to Chinese pornography has also increased the number of abortions. In the past, pornographic videos were also made in North Korea. They began to appear during the leadership of Kim Jong-il, who himself reportedly had a significant collection of pornographic films. Domestic titles were usually immediately seized by the authorities. One domestic title, The Secret Story of the Republic, however, was smuggled to Japan and translated into Japanese by North Korean defectors. The film, featuring Workers' Party of Korea officials violating women, was sold in Japan, where it came with a written disclaimer: \\"Not for entertainment purposes. Distributed for research\\". North Korea has also exported pornography in an effort to gain hard currency. Some of these efforts were through North Korean websites. Watching pornography became widespread among the country's elites in the late 1990s. Thereafter, the practice has spread to other societal strata as well. Domestic pornographic works usually feature nude or bikini-wearing North Korean women dancing to music. The Literature and Art Publishing Company secretly published a pornographic book, Licentious Stories, for the use of party officials. In 2000, the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee also published a pornographic videotape for officials. Imported pornography has nowadays largely replaced domestic pornography. Political and army elites are the most active consumers of pornography. In 2007 renting a CD for one hour cost 2,000 North Korean won, and middle-schoolers were known to rent them. In 1995, a pornographic film could be sold for as much as 80 dollars. In recent years, prices have fallen dramatically due to increased supply, with one Chinese smuggler telling he regularly hands out porn for free for customers who buy pirated K-dramas. South Korean pornographic films are smuggled into the country. Propaganda balloons sent from South Korea to the North have featured sexually explicit material to appeal to North Korean soldiers, too. Henry A. Crumpton, a veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Operations, explains that he has \\"never met a North Korean diplomat who did not want porn, either for personal use or resale.\\" Law According to the Criminal Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: The law specifies that viewing such material is also illegal: The State Security Department is tasked with monitoring illegal imports of pornographic materials. Involvement in illegal import results in the culprit being shot or sent to a kyohwaso (re-education camp) for 10 to 15 years. Executions of several persons accused of watching or distributing pornography took place in late 2013. It is illegal for tourists to bring pornography into the country. Access to \\"sex and adult websites\\" on the Internet has been blocked from the country, but in the past BitTorrent downloads of pornography have been detected, likely relating to foreigners residing in Pyongyang. Likewise, North Koreans living near the border with China use mobile phones equipped with Chinese SIM cards to access Chinese porn sites. When Kim Jong-un's uncle Jang Song-thaek was executed in 2013, distributing pornography was counted among his crimes. North Korea has ratified the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but has enacted no legislation specific to child pornography.

It is a shrub with its branches and leaves covered with a thick layer of woolly hairs and pale yellow flowers in groups of up to nine, surrounded by woolly hairs. Description Muniria quadrangulata is shrub which grows to a height of about and has branches that have four corners in cross-section. The branches, leaves and some of the flower parts are covered with a thick, woolly layer of white hairs. The leaves are oblong to egg-shaped, long, wide and have a wrinkled, blistered surface. The flowers are arranged in groups of up to nine, sometimes twelve, in leaf axils near the ends of the branches, the groups on a hairy stalk long, each flower on a hairy stalk long. The flowers are surrounded by leafy, lance-shaped, woolly bracts and bracteoles. The five sepals are long, mostly woolly and joined for about half their length into a tube with the sepal lobes long. The petals are pale yellow, long and joined for most of their length to form a tube which is hairy on the outside but glabrous on the inside except for a narrow ring of hairs around the ovary. There are five egg- shaped lobes on the end of the tube, the lower, central lobe long and wide at the base and much larger than the other lobes which are a similar size and shape to each other. The four stamens reach to near the end of the tube, the lower pair longer than the upper ones. Flowering occurs from January to August and is followed from January to September by the fruit which is oval-shaped but with four distinct ridges and has the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir from a specimen collected south of Oenpelli. It was given the name Pityrodia quadrangulata and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. In 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber described a new genus, Muniria and transferred this species to it.

The band shell was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. In 2014 it was included as a contributing property in the East Park Historic District. History The city acquired the first for East Park in 1909. F.E. Pease designed the park with its two entrances off of State Street, the curving drives, a small pond, tennis courts, and a music pavilion. The park has subsequently grown to include , and the city has added other amenities. In 1920 the Mason City Chamber of Commerce organized a municipal band made up of professional musicians from around the country to give a series of summer concerts. James M. Fulton from Boston was the conductor, and Mason City native Meredith Willson played the flute and piccolo. The band utilized a portable bandstand for their concerts until this one was dedicated on July 24, 1924. It was designed by a local draftsman named Lester Lewis. Its dedication in 1924 makes this structure, along with the W.D. Petersen Memorial Music Pavilion in Davenport (1924), the two oldest band shells in Iowa. It was also among the first structures built in East Park. Concerts and other civic activities have been held here ever since. During the period of time that Carleton Stewart was the conductor (1937-1963) several changes were made to the band shell. An addition was built onto the rear, the front of the stage was extended to create an apron, the vertical board and batten siding was added to the facade, and a stone veneer was applied to the front of the apron. It is not known the exact year that these additions were made. Wilson was no longer in the municipal band when the band shell was dedicated. He is known to have been in it twice. The first time was on August 22, 1939, when he conducted the Municipal Band, during which they played his composition for the United States Army Air Corps, Wings on High. The second occasion was in June 1962 when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon presented him with the President's Gold Medallion for his promotion of the Bonds for Freedom.

(March 3, 1861 ‚Äì July 1, 1940) was an American missionary, scholar, and traveler. While studying at New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Jersey, he co-founded the Arabian Mission with John Lansing and Samuel Marinus Zwemer. The mission exists today as the American Mission Hospital of Bahrain. He was a missionary for forty years, which included establishing the first mission for the Reformed Church in Arabia, which was also the first mission in eastern Arabia. Between 1891 and 1929, he established mission posts, medical clinics, and churches in Arabia. His wife, Elizabeth, was a nurse and the first single woman to become a missionary in Arabia. Together they founded a women's clinic in Muscat, Oman, worked at missionary posts, and when the United Missions was formed, they were both representatives of the Reformed Church in America for the organization. Cantine co-authored the book, The Golden Milestone: Reminiscences of Pioneer Days Fifty Years in Arabia with Zwemer. Early life and education Cantine Homestead, Stone Ridge, New York. It was childhood home of Dr. James Cantine, missionary and co-founder of the Arabian Mission of the Reformed Church in America.James Cantine, J.G. Lansing, and Samuel Marinus Zwemer, Founding Fathers of the Arabian Mission for the Reformed Church in America He was born on the family homestead in Stone Ridge, New York on March 3, 1861 to James and Charlotte Hasbrouck Cantine. He had a sister, Catherine. His mother died on the family homestead in Stone Ridge on November 24, 1916 at 99 years of age, after having been a widow for many years. Cantine graduated with a Civil Engineering Degree from Union College in 1883. After graduating, Cantine worked for three years as an engineer at Westinghouse Air Brake Company in Schenectady, but decided to become a missionary. He studied at New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he met Dr. Lansing and, with Samuel Zwemer, was inspired to perform missionary work in Arabia. He was ordained on October 1, 1889 by his classis in the Fair Street Reformed Church, Kingston, New York. He received his Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) in 1903 from Union College. Career =Arabian Mission established= Lansing, Cantine, and Zwemer established the Arabian Mission on August 1, 1889, at the Cantine homestead in Stone Ridge. About two and a half months later, on October 16, Cantine boarded a ship for Beirut; Zwemer would join him after he completed his last year at the seminary. He studied Islam and the Arabic language in Beirut and Syria, where he met and was influenced by Henry Harris Jessup, an American Presbyterian missionary and the main editor of the Protestant translation of the Arabic Bible. Both Cantine and Zwemer visited a number of cities in the Arabia region to determine the best place for them to establish a mission. =Basrah and other initial outposts= Canals in Barah with balam, 1913 Cantine established a mission at Basrah, and Zwemer joined him in early 1892. Basrah was chosen because of its location along the eastern coast that enabled easy access to the whole of Northern Arabia. Located on the Persian Gulf, it was the first mission on Arabia's eastern coast, and it was the first mission for the Reform Church in Arabia. Their approach was one of direct evangelism, by converting Arabs to Christianity. Prior to that, missionaries used an indirect approach, where they sought to revitalize the faith among people who were already Christians. Direct evangelism by foreigners had been forbidden by the Ottoman government. Cantine was primarily interested in spreading Christianity, and so he created relationships with other Christian missions in the area, but he also wanted their Arabian Mission to survive and at times bowed to political pressures to do so. Zwemer was a gifted linguist, writer, and orator and became the voice of the Arabian Mission. \\"He had an irrepressible and aggressive personality, earnest where Cantine was tender, driving where his colleague was contemplative.\\" Their plans to establish a needed medical mission were delayed due to staffing issues and funding, but they carried on with their Bible work, taking over efforts of the British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1893, outposts were established in Bahrain and Muscat, by Zwemer and his brother, Peter, respectively. Since its beginning, missionaries and physicians came to support the work of the Arabian Mission and staff its posts. They sold about 200 booklets with Scripture within a couple of years. In 1894, the management of the independent mission was transferred to the Foreign Board of the church. The missionaries hired Dr. Worrall in 1895, but he was severely ill much of his first summer. Cantine returned to the United States for part of the year and raised interest and funds for the mission. In the meantime, there were wars between local tribes, with looting at Muscat. The Bible shop was closed by the government. Another station was opened up at Amara, and Dr. Worrall was well enough to see patients in Basrah and Nasariah, creating a means to build relationships with the local people. They were also selling more Scriptures, about 80% of them to Moslems. Zwemer settled in 1895 or 1896 in Bahrain, which had been judged to have very poor living conditions, like malaria, cholera, dysentery, and smallpox due to significant humidity and high temperatures. In his search for information about living conditions, Cantine found that it was considered \\"the most unhealthy place in all the area.\\" =Other areas= In 1898, Cantine urgently left Basrah for Muscat because Samuel Zwemer and another colleague fell sick. Later, Muscat came to be known as \\"Cantine's station\\". In 1901, Cantine helped build a two-story building, the Mason Memorial Hospital after extensive negotiations with the ruler of Bahrain. Elizabeth DePree, a nurse from Grand Rapids, Michigan, came to Arabia and was the first single woman to work as a missionary in Arabia. She was recruited by the mission and first studied and worked in Bahrain before coming to the mission in Oman. Cantine married DePree in 1904, and they continued their work together. They stayed in Muscat, Oman, where Elizabeth made house calls, worked at a daily clinic, and taught at a sewing school for girls. She became known as the \\"mother of modern medicine in Oman\\". He returned to the United States, and with Zwemer, spoke about the Arabian Mission at the West End Collegiate Church on November 1, 1908, and two weeks later at the Lenox Avenue Collegiate Reformed Church, both in New York City. Cantine and his wife opened a women's clinic in Muscat, which was staffed by Dr. Sarah Hosman. In 1921, the Cantines were transferred to Baghdad to the Reform Church Missionary Society to help rebuild following World War I. =Later years= In 1924, the outposts and stations that they had established were merged with other missions in Mesopotamia and Arabia to form the United Missions in Mesopotania, and both of the Cantines were representatives of the Reform Church of America for the organization. Zwemer raised funds and Cantine implemented the plans to build the Union Church and Religious Center in Baghdad by mid-1926. Elizabeth's health declined and they returned to the United States in April 1926. She died in Stone Ridge on August 30, 1927. He continued his missionary work in Arabia for a further of two years after her death, when he was no longer in good health. He returned to the homestead in Stone Ridge and continued promoting the work of the Arabian mission by speaking out to various sections of the Reformed Church. Cantine was co-author of The Golden Milestone: Reminiscences of Pioneer Days Fifty Years in Arabia with Zwemer, which he spoke about in the United States. Cantine was honored for his 50 years of missionary work on the October 27, 1938 by the Reformed Church at Fair Street, where he was first ordained.  Death  He had a heart attack in 1938 during a vacation in Florida, and a severe heart attack about May 1940, when he was taken to Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, New York. He remained there until his death on July 1, 1940. He was buried with his wife at the Fairview Cemetery in Stone Ridge, New York about July 5, 1940.

Undiminished Violence: The John Minturn Storm of 1846, Thomas G. Clark, 2017, The ship was caught in a gale off Mantoloking in Ocean County, New Jersey shore, south of Sqwan inlet. Thirty-eight lives were lost aboard the ship. This represented the largest loss of life from the storm which claimed upwards of 60 victims. The disaster was immortalized in an 1846 hand-colored lithograph by Currier and Ives. Later, newspapers reported widespread plundering of the dead. The reports prompted the New Jersey Senate to appoint a commission to investigate the validity of the claims. In a March 20, 1846, report by the commission to the Senate, the commission found the claims to be unwarranted.

History It started as a TV series in 1981, before it was adapted into a feature film directed by Manuel Garc√≠a Ferr√© and written by Ines Geldstein. After a 3-to-5 year production period, the movie was completed in 1983 and due to be premiered at the International Kids Film Festival in Portugal that year. It was not until 4 years later, on 9 July 1987, that the movie was officially released in Argentina by an independent distributor. Plot Ico is a wild colt who lives in the forest with his mother and friends, including Jaba the boar whom he saves once from the Black Duke's hunt. Each full moon the animals hear in the distance the frightening and mysterious tolling of a bell. Ico wants to find out who rings the bell and why. One day he sees the royal parade and decides he wants to be the king's horse. He follows the parade and becomes friends with Larguirucho, the friendly castle horse keeper. In the night Ico tells his mother he wants to be the king's horse. The next day, with Larguirucho's help, Ico sneaks into the castle where he meets the other stable horses. He learns that if he wants to be the King's horse, he has to talk to the Black Duke, the king's chief equerry, because he has the power to choose the king's horse. The horses warn Ico that the Black Duke is a very sinister and evil man. Grandpa Mateo, the oldest horse in the stable, tells him about a mysterious phantom bell tolling that frightens the horses. As every time they hear it, a horse disappears from the stable and never returns. The next day, walking in the castle, Ico meets Preciosa, the daughter of the King's horse, whilst running after her, the Black Duke catches him. Ico tells him that he wants to be the king's horse, so the Black Duke promises to train him to become a royal steed. However he orders his henchmen to make the training very hard to discourage the little colt. Larguirucho brings Ico some food after the exhausting training, then they hear the bell tolling again. Larguirucho runs back to the stable and realizes that another horse has gone missing. He goes to talk to the King, but the Black Duke blames him for stealing the horses and puts him into prison. Later that night, Ico learns the story of the bell. It is said that an ancient greedy King conquered the neighbourhood and stole their gold. He melted the gold and cast a giant bell, whose tolling would remind the realm of his unlimited power. The bell was so huge, that the tower couldn't hold its tolling and crashed under its weight. The bell fell and buried the king underneath. The legend says that the ghost of the vain king, as a punishment for his greed, must toll the bell on each full moon. Ico is determined to solve the mystery, as he thinks the person who tolls the bell is the same person that steals the horses from the stable. Ico sets off up the hill, to the ruins of the old castle, where he again meets Preciosa, who tells him her father ‚Äì the king's horse ‚Äì has gone missing. Ico discovers that it is the Black Duke and his henchmen who have stolen the horses from the stable. In order to use them to lift huge stones to then drop them on the bell to break it up for the gold. It is when this takes place that the tolling sounds. The Black Duke realizes Ico has seen them, so he captures him and ties him to the bell to be crashed by one of the stones. Preciosa sees this and runs to the forest for help, coming back with Ico's mom and friends. The Black Duke is clinging onto the swinging stone and rushing the horses to pull the ropes before Ico escapes. He finally cuts the rope so the rock would smash Ico, but Ico escapes at the last minute and the swinging stone turns and hits the bell, consequently crushing the Black Duke. Larguirucho becomes the new chief barn keeper, and Ico is offered a position as one of the king's horses. However, at the last moment, Ico changes his mind, deciding he would rather remain a wild horse. Preciosa decides to join him in the prairie.

She was a founding member of the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the founder of the Women's Service Club. Early life Mary P. Evans was born in Oberlin, Ohio, in 1866. She was the eighth of nine children of Henry Evans, an undertaker and cabinetmaker, and Henrietta Leary Evans. She graduated from Oberlin College. Evans came from a family of activists. In 1858, her father was one of a group of men who were arrested for attempting to free a runaway slave from a U.S. marshal. The incident became known as the Oberlin‚ÄìWellington Rescue. Her uncle, Lewis Sheridan Leary, was killed in John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and her cousin John Anthony Copeland, Jr., was hanged with Brown. Years later, her mother delivered an address at Harpers Ferry at the second annual meeting of the Niagara Movement, a civil rights group founded by W. E. B. Du Bois. Mary's sister, Anna Evans Murray, was a teacher, civic leader, and early proponent of free kindergarten classes for black children. Anna's husband, Daniel Murray, was a Library of Congress employee whose duties included obtaining copies of African American-authored books for the \\"Exhibit of Negro Authorship\\" at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Career Evans moved to Washington, D.C., where she taught in the public schools for ten years. She also wrote a health and beauty column for The Woman's Era, an African-American woman's newspaper edited by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. On June 27, 1894, she and Butler R. Wilson, a prominent Boston civil rights attorney, were married by the Reverend Francis James Grimk√©. The couple moved to 13 Rutland Square in Boston's South End, where they raised six children. In May 1899, Wilson was the keynote speaker at a women's anti-lynching demonstration in Boston's Chickering Hall. In her speech she criticized President William McKinley for failing to address the problem of lynching and called for federal government intervention. Other speakers that day included Julia Ward Howe, Mary C. Leavitt, Alice Freeman Palmer, and Florida Ruffin Ridley. Wilson and her husband were among the organizers of the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). They were the most prominent African-American leaders of the organization at a time when its leadership was dominated by whites. Butler Wilson was the branch's first secretary, and joined the national board in 1913; in the 1920s he became branch president. Mary Wilson volunteered as a traveling organizer, recruiting thousands of new members in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1916 she led an investigation into discrimination at the New England Sanitarium, and a campaign to persuade Boston's department stores to hire black saleswomen. She also worked to combat discrimination in the Boston school system. Historian Mark Schneider calls her \\"the unsung heroine of the Boston NAACP.\\"Schneider (1997), p. 158. During World War I she organized a knitting circle of 350 women and girls to provide gloves and scarves for Boston's black soldiers. The knitting club became the Women's Service Club in 1919, a charitable organization which is still in operation at its original headquarters at 464 Massachusetts Avenue in the South End. It is one of Boston's oldest organizations for women of color. She also served on the advisory board of the Boston Trade School. Death and legacy Mary Evans Wilson died at her South End home on March 28, 1928. She is buried next to her husband in the Forest Hills Cemetery.

The two cases were heard together, however two separate judgments were issued with Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) addressing the substantive issues, and Flint v Webb addressing the applications for a certificate to appeal to the Privy Council. The judgement of Griffith CJ in Flint v Webb suggested two ways in which that conflict could be resolved. Both suggestions were adopted by the Commonwealth Parliament by legislation that permitted the States to tax the income of a Commonwealth officer, and gave the High Court exclusive appellate jurisdiction on such constitutional questions. The constitutional foundation of the decision was overturned by the subsequent decision of the High Court in the 1920 Engineers' case..  Background  The ability of a state to tax the income of a Commonwealth officer was one of the \\"constitutional loose ends\\" about the nature of the federal system and the legislative powers of the new Commonwealth that remained unresolved following the debates in the constitutional conventions. =The High Court and the Privy Council= One of the issues debated in the drafting of the Constitution was the respective roles of the High Court and the Privy Council. The draft constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies was that there was to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State, unless it involved the interests of some other dominion.See for example This was not acceptable to the British, who insisted on a compromise. Section 74 as ultimately enacted by the Imperial Parliament provided that if the dispute was between the Commonwealth and a State as to the extent of their respective powers under the Constitution, there could only be an appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council if the High Court granted a certificate \\"that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council\\".. It was anticipated that this may give rise to conflict between the High Court and the Privy Council because the Privy Council could still hear an appeal directly from a state court. The view that was supported in the House of Lords was that the view of the Privy Council would prevail \\"as it was the decision of Her Majesty herself as the fountain of justice, administering justice throughout her Empire at home and abroad. p 1365-72. One of the consequences of the concurrent appellate jurisdiction of the High Court and the Privy Council was that it was the unsuccessful litigant in the Supreme Court who had the choice of jurisdiction and the Commonwealth had no direct power to limit appeals from a State Supreme Court as the Constitutional limitation only applied to appeals from the High Court. The way in which the Commonwealth dealt with this issue in the Judiciary Act 1903, was by section 30 which gave the High Court \\"original jurisdiction in all matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation\\", sections 38 and 39 then removed the jurisdiction of the State Courts on such matters, but then gave it back to them in section 39 under the guise of Federal jurisdiction in which there was no appeal to the Privy Council and instead only an appeal to the High Court. =Wollaston's case in the Supreme Court of Victoria= The Full Court of the Supreme Court, Madden CJ, Williams & √† Beckett JJ, had held in 1902 that Dr Harry Wollaston was required to pay Victorian income tax in relation to the salary he received as the Commonwealth Comptroller-General of Customs.. The Court considered and rejected the applicability of decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in the interpretation of the Constitution of Australia, in particular the decision in McCulloch v. Maryland,McCulloch v. Maryland 4 Wheat. 316; Instead the Supreme Court applied the Privy Council decision in The Bank of Toronto v Lambe,. holding that the Privy Council had refused to apply the principle from McCulloch v Maryland and that it cannot govern the construction of the Australian Constitution. =D'Emden v Pedder in the High Court= The High Court held in D'Emden v Pedder that the salary receipts of federal government employees were not subject to state stamp duty. Wollaston's case was cited in argument,D'Emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 at p 98-100. as that the applicability of the principle in McCulloch v Maryland, to the Constitution was negatived by the decision of the Privy Council in The Bank of Toronto v Lambe. In response Griffith CJ stated \\"The decision in the case of The Bank of Toronto v Lambe merely amounts to this-that under sec. 92 [of the Constitution of Canada] the Provinces have the power of direct taxation\\". The judgement of the Court, delivered by Griffith CJ, did not refer to Wollaston's case nor The Bank of Toronto v Lambe and instead held that \\"some, if not all, of the framers of that Constitution were familiar, not only with the Constitution of the United States, but with that of the Canadian Dominion and those of the British colonies. When, therefore, under these circumstances, we find embodied, in the Constitution provisions undistinguishable in substance, though varied in form, from provisions of the Constitution of the United States which had long since been judicially interpreted by the Supreme Court of that Republic, it is not an unreasonable inference that its framers intended that like provisions should receive like interpretation.\\"D'Emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 at p 113. The Court subsequently described the Constitution as \\"framed in Australia by Australians, and for the use of the Australian people\\".Peterswald v Bartley (1904) 1 CLR 497 at 509. The three inaugural judges of the High Court had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution, at [48]-[49]. thus when the Court spoke of what was framers of the Constitution knew or intended their Honours are referring to their personal experience in that process, and not to the intention or knowledge of the Imperial Parliament in passing the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. The Court held that, consistent with McCulloch v Maryland the Australian Constitution contained an implied immunity of instrumentalities, where neither the Commonwealth nor State governments could be affected by the laws of the other. (2003) 31 Federal Law Review 507 at p 508. = Deakin v Webb in the High Court = In Deakin v Webb the High Court adhered to what it had said D'Emden v Pedder, that the principles to be applied in interpreting the Australian Constitution, as to the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States, were substantially the same as those laid down in McCulloch v Maryland. Their Honours rejected the assertion that there was a preference for American decisions, or any disregard for British decisions, instead holding that the distinction was based on the deliberate adoption by the framers of the Australian Constitution of the language of the United States Constitution and a rejection of the scheme of the Canadian Constitution. Each of the Judges rejected an application for a certificate to appeal to the Privy Council, finding that the determination of Constitutional questions was the responsibility of the High Court.Deakin v Webb (1904) 1 CLR 585 at p 619-31. =Webb v Outtrim in the Privy Council= The Victorian Commissioner of Taxes did not accept the decision of the High Court and assessed the taxable income of Mr Outram as including the salary he received from the Commonwealth as the Deputy Postmaster-General. The Supreme Court of Victoria followed the decision of the High Court in Deakin v Webb. As the unsuccessful litigant, the Commissioner of Taxes sought leave to appeal to the Privy Council rather than the High Court. Hodges J held that the Supreme Court of Victoria had power under the Order in Council of 9 June 1860 to grant leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to take away this right of appeal.. The Privy Council held in Webb v Outtrim that a State government could tax Commonwealth officials and criticised the decisions of the High Court in D'Emden v Pedder and Deakin v Webb. Their Lordships held that the relevant question was not the intention of the Australians who framed the Constitution, but rather what the British Parliament had in mind when it passed the Constitution Act.; . Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) The question returned to the High Court in May 1907. The two cases were heard together, however the judgment in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) addressed the substantive issues. The decision of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim had been followed by Murray DCJ in the NSW District Court, finding that Baxter was liable to pay NSW income tax in respect of his salary as a Customs officer. Similarly the Court of Petty Sessions of Victoria had followed the Privy Council and had found that Flint was liable to pay Victorian income tax in respect of his salary in the Postmaster-General's Department. Both Baxter and Flint appealed directly to the High Court. The Commissioners of Taxation objected to three of the Justices hearing the case as the decision would directly affect their interests as residents of NSW. Griffith CJ overruled the objection, holding it was a case of necessity as every Justice would have the same interest.Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1090. =An appeal direct to the High Court= The Court held that District Court and Court of Petty Sessions were exercising federal jurisdiction pursuant to section 39 of the Judiciary Act, such that section 73 of the Constitution,Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, section 73. gave the High Court jurisdiction to hear the appeals.Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1136 per Griffith CJ. =Which court is the ultimate arbiter= The High Court held that it was, in the absence of a certificate under s 74 of the Constitution, the ultimate arbiter on all questions concerning the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States such that it was not bound to follow the decision of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim. The High Court reconsidered the position, but reaffirmed its decision in D'Emden v Pedder. Griffith CJ delivered the \\"rather pugnacious judgment\\" of the majority as follows : > It was common knowledge [at the time of Federation], not only that the > decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given > widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States > was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian > publicists it was almost as familiar as the British Constitution. It was > known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee > familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form > members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on > appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with > in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would > sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to > the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And no disrespect > is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial > Committee were not regarded either as being familiar with the history or > conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any > sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities > which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, > the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part > which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued > with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must > work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended > from time to time, had played in the development of the nation, and the > harmonious working of its political institutions.Baxter v Commissioners of > Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1111-2 per Griffith CJ. =Implied immunity= The High Court reconsidered its decision in Deakin v Webb giving the opinion of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim all the weight it deserves. The majority noted that NSW and Victoria were now seeking to overturn their success in the Railway Servants' case. The majority held that the Privy Council did not appear to have considered the first line of reasoning from Deakin v Webb that an attribute of sovereignty was that the only interference with the Commonwealth's powers was that prescribed in the Constitution. The second line of reasoning concerned the similarity between the relevant provisions of the United States and Australian constitutions. The majority attributed the opinion of the Privy Council to a lack of familiarity with the subject and a lack of assistance from the British counsel who appeared for the respondents.Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1121-3 per Griffith CJ. Part of the criticism of Webb v Outtrim by the majority was by reference to the statement that \\"The American Union, on the other hand, has erected a tribunal which possesses jurisdiction to annul a Statute upon the ground that it is unconstitutional\\" The majority pointed out that the United States Constitution contains no express provision to endow the Supreme Court with special powers,There is nothing in the opinion to suggest the Privy Council had been referred to the foundation for the jurisdiction being the decision in Marbury v. Madison , a decision that was, at the time, controversial: see the letter from President Jefferson to William Jarvis (28 September 1820) in The Writings of Thomas Jefferson. and the relevant provisions were identical with those creating the High Court in Australia.Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1125 per Griffith CJ. =Can the States tax the income of a Commonwealth officer= The success of the argument put by Higgins on behalf of his clients in Deakin v Webb did not sit well with him, writing in 1905 that \\"The man in the street is startled and puzzled. He sees a public official, enjoying a regular salary in the postal department, paying the Victorian income-tax until federation, and then suddenly exempted from the tax because the post-office has passed over to federal control.\\" Having been appointed to the High Court along with Isaacs J in 1906, Higgins J set out his dissenting views in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) that: > It is true that I have held, and still hold, a strong opinion with regard to > the judgment of Marshall CJ in McCulloch v Maryland ‚Äì the judgment on which > Deakin v Webb was based ‚Äì although I utter the opinion with a feeling that > it will be regarded by some as almost blasphemy. I regard it as being the > utterance rather of the statesman than of the lawyer.Baxter v Commissioners > of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1164 per Higgins J. Flint v Webb The judgment in Flint v Webb addressed the applications for a certificate to appeal to the Privy Council. The Court unanimously declined to issue a certificate to appeal to the Privy Council, with each judge finding that the fact that there was a decision of the Privy Council that was inconsistent with a previous decision of the High Court, where the High Court had refused a certificate of appeal, was inconvenient, but that was not itself a sufficient reason to grant a certificate. Griffith CJ suggested two ways to escape the inconvenient position, (1) make the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court on federal matters exclusive of the State Supreme Court or (2) legislate that the income provided to federal public servants was subject to the rights of the States to tax them.Flint v Webb (1907) 4 CLR 1178 at p. 1187 per Griffith CJ. Higgins J described the suggestion that the Commonwealth be deprived of the appellate assistance of the very efficient State Courts as an extreme step. His Honour doubted that the issue could be resolved by federal legislation given that the majority's view in Deakin v Webb rested on constitutional grounds and the federal Parliament had no power to alter the constitution.Flint v Webb (1907) 4 CLR 1178 at p. 1194 per Higgins J. Aftermath =Legislative response= The decisions of the High Court in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) and Flint v Webb were handed down in June 1907. In September the federal Parliament responded to the conflict, adopting both measures identified by Griffith CJ, passing the Commonwealth Salaries Act 1907, which dealt with the substantive dispute by expressly permitting the States to tax the income of Commonwealth officers, and the Judiciary Act 1907, which gave the High Court exclusive jurisdiction \\"in matters involving any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the constitutional power of any two or more of the States\\". The practical effect of the Judiciary Act amendment was that as no State Court could give a decision on an inter se question, there was no decision to appeal to the Privy Council other than one from the High Court and that required a certificate from the High Court.It was still theoretically possible to appeal to the Privy Council from an inferior court however this possibility was considered remote: =Commissioners of Taxation v Baxter in the Privy Council= Despite the failure to obtain certificates under s 74 of the Constitution, the NSW and Victorian commissioners of taxation sought leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The decision of the Privy Council did not address the need for a certificate to appeal and instead declined special leave to appeal primarily on the grounds that the Commonwealth Salaries Act meant the controversy could not arise again.; . Subsequent developments The Commonwealth introduced its own income tax in 1915, and to help fund Australia's war effort in the First World War. By the end of the war, the Commonwealth revenue was three times that of the combined revenue of the States. Having found that the imposition of income tax by the States was an attempted interference with the sovereign powers of the Commonwealth, the mutuality of immunity established in the Railway Servants' case, meant that the Commonwealth had no power to levy an income tax on the salaries of State officers. In 1920, following changes in the composition of the High Court, Railway Servants' case, was overturned in the Engineers' case, Despite the policy of the Australian Labor Party from 1908 that appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished, it took no legislative action to implement that policy, (1959) 33 Australian Law Journal 196. and appeals to the Privy Council never became a major political issue. There were calls among lawyers and academics in the 1950s for the abolition of such appeals, [1957] Melbourne University Law Review 4. [1957] Res Judicatae 78. however there was no legislative response until 1968, abolishing appeals in matters involving federal legislation,Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 (Cth). in 1975, abolishing almost all appeals from the High Court,Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975 (Cth). and in 1986 which abolished appeals from State Courts.Australia Act 1986 Imperial and Commonwealth (with the request and consent of the Australian States). The mechanism by which the Parliament sought to prevent appeals to the Privy Council, by way of section 39 of the Judiciary Act, has the effect that \\"where a matter which would otherwise be within the jurisdiction of a State court answers the description of a matter within s 75 or s 76 of the Constitution, the State court is invested with federal jurisdiction with respect to that matter to the exclusion of State jurisdiction under s 109 of the Constitution.\\". Because federal jurisdiction can only be invested in a court, it means that a State tribunal, such as the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, cannot determine disputes between residents of different States..

She was a founder of the Jamaican Family Planning League and Mother‚Äôs Welfare Clinic, as well as the driving force behind the Old Age Pension program. Early life Gladys May Farquharson was born on 26 March 1894 in Half Way Tree, Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica to Lilian May (n√©e Stone) and Arthur Wildman Farquharson. The Farquharsons' forebearers had immigrated to Jamaica in the latter part of the 18th century. Her father was the Crown Solicitor for Jamaica from 1894 to 1911, before going into private practice. Farquharson attended various schools, in Jamaica, the United States, Jersey, and Cheltenham Ladies College prior to studying social work at the London School of Economics between 1928 and 1930. Career During World War I, Farquharson worked as a volunteer aid to the nursing staff of the Royal Herbert Military Hospital in Woolwich. While she was in London, Farquharson also became involved in the settlement house movement, working in poorer neighborhoods in East London. In the early 1930s after completing her education, Farquharson returned to Jamaica and worked as an assistant to her father in his law practice. In addition to helping him, she became a Justice of the Peace and worked in the Juvenile Court for many years. Farquharson and Amy Bailey joined forces in 1937 and began working on strategies to improve the lives of women. One of the issues they discussed was family planning and another, was an initiative called Save the Children Fund, which they founded in 1938. Others who worked with them were Mary Morris Knibb, Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley. With seed money given by May‚Äôs father Arthur Farquharson, Bailey traveled to London with Una Marson to raise funds for providing food, clothing and textbooks to Jamaican school children. The fund drive was a resounding success and the organization is still thriving. In 1939, Farquharson helped found the Birth Control League of Jamaica, which would later become the Family Planning League of Jamaica (FPLJ). At the same time, she founded in Kingston the Mother‚Äôs Welfare Clinic. The goal of these organizations was to promote birth control among the populace as a means to improve their social condition, provide care and education about health needs to mothers and children, and to enlist government backing of the program. To that end, Farquharson kept a wide correspondence with other reformers, such as Vera Houghton, Edith How-Martyn, and Margaret Sanger, as well as birth control suppliers, such as Holland‚ÄìRantos. Reformers, such as Farquharson, saw their clients in Jamaica as a special population, which needed unique contraception methods and education techniques. Much of this attitude came out of the Eugenics movement of the 1930s, which saw the Afro-Jamaican poor as a culturally different and backward segment of society. Though in some ways, the efforts of the FPLJ were opposed by the Catholic Church of Jamaica, clergy and birth control advocates were in agreement that illegitimacy and co-habitation without marriage were social ills. Farquharson and the FPLJ, believed that limiting birth rates would not only reduce immorality, but also would diminish demand on the over-burdened and under- funded health services. Organizations such as the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the leadership of the Jamaica Labour Party, joined the Catholic Church in opposing birth control, seeing it as an attempt to limit negro population growth. But, Farquharson's friend and fellow activist, Bailey, daughter of a notable family of black educators, was outspoken in support of the FPLJ, seeing birth control as a means of economic survival. Both Bailey and Farquharson addressed issues of discrimination based on skin shade, recognizing that women with darker skin, no matter their racial profile, often faced greater difficulties and limitations to their ability to access services and employment. Farquharson was one of the leaders who pushed for the FPLJ to join the International Planned Parenthood Federation, serving as honorary General Secretary at the 1958 conference held by Planned Parenthood in Kingston. After eighteen years, the FPLJ was successful in gaining government support of its family planning initiatives. In the 1940s, Farquharson campaigned for women's suffrage, and after the death of her father in 1947 took over his advocacy projects for agricultural cooperatives, such as the Banana Producers‚Äô Association, the Citrus Growers‚Äô Association, the Coconut Producers‚Äô Association and the Sugar Manufacturers‚Äô Association. She also took over his responsibilities at the Farquharson Institute of Public Affairs. Of particular interest to Farquharson were unemployment, education and pension provisions and she served on various governmental committees that attempted to address these issues in Jamaica. In 1956, Farquharson donated a furnished house in Kingston, with capacity for fourteen people, and an endowment to the Anglican Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands as a home for clergy, aged parishioners, or convalescing patients of limited means from the Nuttall Memorial Hospital. The facility was still operational in 2013, requiring residents to pay a nominal rental which includes housekeeping and meals. In 1962, Farquharson was involved in the creation of a pension program for older Jamaicans, for which she had been advocating since 1937. Farquharson wrote articles in many newspapers under the pen-name of \\"Fedalia\\" urging the government to adopt a European-style \\"Old-Age Pension Scheme\\". Farquharson remained active into her 80s, continuing to work on social issues for vulnerable populations, specifically the young and aged. Death and legacy On International Women's Day 8 March 1990, Bailey and Farquharson, were awarded the Order of Jamaica for their contributions to women's rights. A ceremony bestowing the order was held on 5 June 1990. That same year, a documentary on the lives of Bailey and Farquharson, their remarkable friendship, and their work for women's political and economic equality was produced by Sistren Research. Farquharson died on 29 June 1992 in Cross Roads, Saint Andrew, Jamaica. Shortly after her death, the Farquharson Institute of Public Affairs created a garden to her memory and led a campaign to provide books to Jamaican libraries in Farquharson's name. She was honored posthumously in a celebration of International Women's Day in 2002.

The surgery is performed in a hospital, outpatient office setting.  Alternatives  * wig * oral medication * lotion that contains prescription Lotions that contain Rogaine or finasteride may lead to hair growth in some patients. Rogaine grows fuzz on the crown of the head and finasteride tends to grow actual hairs on the crown of the head.

The location was formerly the site of Bridewell Palace. The Royal Hotel was founded before 1845 by Constant de Keyser, an immigrant to England from Belgium. It was a high-end hotel, catering mainly to visitors from continental Europe. His son Polydore de Keyser ran the hotel from around 1856. A new hotel building with five storeys and two basements was opened at the same site on 5 September 1874, designed by the Scottish architect Edward Augustus Gruning. The foundation stone was laid by the daughter of the Belgian Vice-Counsul. The new building had a long curved fa√ßade facing the River Thames, close to Sion College and near the site of the new City of London School building that opened in 1883. The exterior was in an Anglicised form of the Second Empire Style, faced by white Suffolk bricks and Portland stone, with a Mansard roof covered with green slates and hips, ridges and dormers in zinc. An archway to through to an internal courtyard, at the centre of which was a glass dome covering a billiard room below, later used as a lounge. The interior was decorated in opulent French style, with 230 guest rooms and many function rooms, including a dining hall with space for 400 people. Furniture was imported from Paris. A second wing opened in 1882, when the hotel became the largest in London, accommodating up to 480 guests, with a second dining room for another 250 people, and rooms for 150 staff. Sir Polydore de Keyser had no children. His hotel was sold to a limited company in 1897, and a nephew Polydor Welchand de Keyser took over the management. The hotel suffered a serious decline of business after the outbreak of the First World War, and it was taken over by a receiver. With a shortage of office space in London for the wartime ministries, the hotel was requisitioned in May 1916 by the Office of Works for the wartime use of the Royal Flying Corps. Renamed \\"Adastral House\\", the first building to bear that name, it was the London headquarters of the Royal Flying Corps until it moved to Hotel Cecil on the formation of the new Air Ministry and the Royal Air Force in 1918. For a short period it was occupied by the Royal Army Medical Corps, until 1919. The owner of the hotel claimed compensation, leading to a legal case on the power of the royal prerogative, Attorney-General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Limited. The case reached the House of Lords, which held that the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 replaced the royal prerogative, and that compensation was due under the Defence Act 1842. Unilever House, built on the site of De Keyser's The hotel never reopened. The building was sold to Lever Brothers in 1921, and it became their London headquarters. The hotel building was demolished in 1931 to make way for the construction of Unilever House.

The company produced electric guitars and basses until its factory closed in 1975.History on Micro Frets website, 18 Oct 2019 After some years of hiatus, Micro-Frets went back to business in 2017. The company currently produces electric guitars only.  History  The company was founded by Ralph Jones in 1967, originally under the name \\"Micro Tech\\". Jones and a small group of builders set up in a 15,000-square-foot factory financed by business partner Francis Marion Huggins on Grove Road. Apart of cutting bodies and necks, they also machined components including the company's Micro-Nut and Calibrato tailpiece. The first four models of guitars introduced that same year were the \\"Orbiter\\", \\"Huntington\\", \\"Plainsman\\" and \\"Covington\\", with bass guitars models added later. The guitars combined unique body shapes and idiosyncratic color schemes with proprietary technology such as the Calibrato vibrato, adjustable nut for intonation, and even an early wireless transmitter. Between 1967 and 1974 roughly 3,000 were made. In April 1972, Jones died from a heart attack, with Hazel Jones continuing operations with builder Gary Free in charge of construction and design. For nearly four years, Free designed and built models made with remaining inventory. The company was briefly revived in 2004 when Will Meadors bought the \\"Micro-Frets\\" name with the purpose of relaunching the brand, although it was just to make a small run of guitars. In 2017, 50 years after the company was created, Micro Frets went back into production, with an initial launch of 4 models: Spacetone, Swinger, Stage II and Signature.  Artists  Today Micro Frets guitars enjoy a cult status. Past players include Carl Perkins, Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad, Dave Fielding of The Chameleons, and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode.

It is distinct due to its three phases of coloration that it goes through as it ages. It grows to a maximum size of 45 cm (18 in). It is found in Northern Argentina in Rio Uruguay. It lives in fast-flowing waters where it mostly feeds on algae.  Phases of coloration  The Hypostomus Luteus goes through a significant change in color as it ages. In its first phase it has a dark brown to black body with yellow speckles all over its body. The fins are yellow. In the second phase the body gets a mix of yellow and black. The speckles fade away and the yellow starts to cover the whole body. In the third phase the entire body is gold. Not all Hypostomus Luteus reach full gold coloration and some even start losing gold after reaching phase 3.  Pet trade  This species is caught in the wild and sold in the pet trade. Hobbyists keep them in ponds or aquariums. Although they are caught in the wild this does not significantly effect their population. The fish has become increasingly popular among experienced hobbyists in recent years. The fish is can be sold for upwards of $1000 for a third phase specimen. In The Aquarium Unlike most Loricariidae fish, Hypostomus Luteus should be kept in generally cooler waters of around 19‚Äì24 degrees Celsius or 67‚Äì75 degrees Fahrenheit. This is due to their native habitat, Rio Uruguay, having generally milder waters in comparison to the habitats of other Loricariidae species which are usually farther north.

The sport is most popular in the north-east and mid-Atlantic areas of the country. However, the game has recently developed into a popular team sport for both men and women in all regions of the United States.  U.S. national teams  Every year the United States puts together five teams to compete on an international level. There is a men's indoor team, and four outdoor teams: men's, women's, men's under 19 and women's under 19. Since the beginning of the men's World Lacrosse Championship in 1967, the United States national teams have won a total of thirty world championships.  Professional Lacrosse  =Premier Lacrosse League= In 2018, star lacrosse player Paul Rabil introduced a new league, called the Premier Lacrosse League. It is a joint venture with his brother, Mike. Three main contributors are The Chernin Group, Joe Tsai and The Raine Group. It consists of six teams, Chaos Lacrosse Club, Chrome Lacrosse Club, Atlas Lacrosse Club, Whipsnakes Lacrosse Club, Redwoods Lacrosse Club and Archers Lacrosse Club. It currently has a deal with NBC Sports to broadcast the games. The league shortened the field by 10 yards, and introduced many other new rules in order to speed the game up. It also offered higher salaries than Major League Lacrosse, health-care, and a stake in the company. The league is using a tour based system, so the franchises aren‚Äôt based in any cities. Its inaugural season was in 2019. =Major League Lacrosse= In 1998, Jake Steinfeld became inspired by an article that spoke about the growth of lacrosse, and wanted to develop a professional outdoor league. By 2001, the MLL or Major League Lacrosse had started play to capitalize on the growing demand of lacrosse both in the United States and around the world. Major League Lacrosse is currently a six-team professional league with the bulk of the teams in the Northeastern United States. Many of these players are considered some of the best, if not the best, in the world. The current Major League Lacrosse teams include: Atlanta Blaze, Boston Cannons, New York Lizards, Chesapeake Bayhawks, Denver Outlaws, Dallas Rattlers, along with the Charlotte Hounds, who are on a hiatus. Unlike high school and college lacrosse, the MLL uses a two-point line on its field that sits sixteen yards from the front of the goal. They also have recently implemented a sixty-second shot clock which speeds up an already fast-paced game. =National Lacrosse League= In addition to Major League Lacrosse, which is played outdoors in the summer, the National Lacrosse League is a box lacrosse league from January to June. Because of these differing schedules, many current professional lacrosse players will start the year off in box lacrosse and end with outdoor lacrosse in the summer. Box lacrosse is a slightly different version of traditional lacrosse and is played in a dried-out hockey rink. Goalies wear pads comparable to the pads an ice hockey player would traditionally wear. Games in box lacrosse also feature six players versus six instead of ten versus ten matchups in outdoor lacrosse. There are currently thirteen teams in the National Lacrosse League. They are the Georgia Swarm, New England Black Wolves, Rochester Knighthawks, Toronto Rock, Calgary Roughnecks, Colorado Mammoth, Saskatchewan Rush, Philadelphia Wings, San Diego Seals, Buffalo Bandits and Vancouver Warriors. =United Women‚Äôs Lacrosse League= Starting in 2016, the United Women's Lacrosse League began play throughout the United States with four different teams. Currently, the league's teams are located only on the northern east coast as these areas can draw the biggest fan bases. The teams involved in the league play are the Baltimore Ride, the Boston Storm, the Long Island Sound, and the Philadelphia Force. The league is attempting to rewrite the book on women's professional sports. At the moment, players have their travel expenses paid for but do not receive a salary as the thirty to forty-thousand-dollar budget is currently used to keep the league running. Still, this could soon change. By comparison, players in the MLL make somewhere between ten and twenty-five thousand dollars a year. =Women‚Äôs Professional Lacrosse League= The Women's Professional Lacrosse League (WPLL) is a women's lacrosse league in the United States. The league is composed of five teams: the Baltimore Brave, New England Command, New York Fight, Philadelphia Fire, and Upstate Pride. League play started on Saturday, June 2, 2018. Structure and function Lacrosse is a full field, 10 vs 10 contact sport. Each team has one goalie, three defenders, three mid fielders, and three attackmen. Throughout the contest, players attempt use their sticks to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. At the end of the game, the team with the most goals wins. In college lacrosse, the games consist of four, fifteen minute quarters. This game length decreases to twelve minutes per quarter at the high school level, and decreases to ten minute per quarter at the little league level. Each team must have four players (a goalie and three defenders typically), on their defensive side of the field at all times. They must also have three players (usually three attackmen) on their offensive side of the ball at all times. The remaining three players (usually midfielders or middies) are free to roam the field as they please during the game. There are ten players on the field at a time. Still each team is allowed a maximum of seven players on their half of the field at a team and six players on their opponents‚Äô side of the field at a time with the goalie being the extra man. Like hockey, substitutions are considered ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù meaning that the players may enter and exit the field during gameplay assuming each team has a maximum of ten players on the field at the time. The game essentially has the same rules as hockey and is played both indoor (box lacrosse) and outdoor (full field).  History  Lacrosse started out as a tribal ritual for Native Americans to play before going to war. Differences between groups may have been settled through large, multi-day games covering expansive fields and many players. The game was originally known as stickball. Ever since its creation, it has been considered a collision sport like football and hockey, not a contact sport like basketball and soccer. For a short amount of time, lacrosse was a full-fledged Olympic sport. After westward expansion, Europeans modified the game to make it much more alike the college and high school level game played today. When natives played lacrosse, dodging defenders was considered cowardly and was looked down upon. Since they were preparing for war, they were taught to embrace the pains involved with playing the game and fight through them. Throwing the ball from stick to stick was seen as a trick in the game, not a commonly utilized skill. Nowadays, these two trends have changed in a great way. Being able to skillfully pass from between teammates and dodge defenders to create open shots have become a pinnacle of today's current game.  Growth  Lacrosse in the US is currently one of the fastest growing sports in America. With a faster growth rate than swimming, bowling, water polo, cross country, ice hockey, and soccer, there were 36,000 college lacrosse players in the United States as of 2015. From 2009 to 2014 the growth rate for lacrosse has been 28%. In 2009, 1,984 high schools across the country had sponsored a lacrosse program, but by 2014, 2,535 high schools across the country had sponsored a lacrosse program. Originally lacrosse was only played on the east coast, but it is starting to make a move out to the middle and west of the United States. 750,000 children across the United States played lacrosse in 2015.

In November 2018, the country's Narcotics Control Act was amended and use of medical cannabis became legal, making South Korea the first country in East Asia to legalize medical cannabis. While cannabis use has arisen in South Korea since the 1970s, it remains far less popular than synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine; of 11,916 people arrested for drug crimes in 2015, only 1/100 were for cannabis-based drugs. History =Early history= Cannabis was an important crop in ancient Korea, with samples of hempen fabric discovered dating back as early as 3000 BCE. The traditional sambe cloth, an ivory colored fabric, is made from hemp. In addition to its use as fabric, the hemp seed was thought to have medicinal qualities such as a laxative. =Modern history= Following the Rhee Syngman administration's 1957 Narcotics Act, \\"Indian Marijuana\\", along with poppies, opium, and cocaine, was labelled a forbidden narcotic. There is speculation that this act was heavily encouraged by the U.S. Treasury Department's Federal Bureau of Narcotic's first commander Harry Anslinger, who had long been advocating for its prohibition. Importantly, the 1957 act only outlawed Indian-grown marijuana, allowing the Korean market of cannabis growth to flourish. In the 1960s, Korean cannabis usage rose dramatically with the influence of hippie culture diffusing outwards from U.S. army bases in Korea. Using the \\"happy smoke\\" started to symbolize rebelliousness, and many popular singers of the time began smoking the herb. In the 1970s, amid its associations with insurgent youth culture abroad, cannabis was banned in all forms under the Cannabis Control Act of 1976, which later merged with the Narcotics Control Act in 2000. The across- the-board ban on cannabis remained unchanged. In January 2018, Rep. Shin Chang-Hyun, a member of the National Assembly of South Korea, proposed a bill that would revise the Narcotics Control Act and allow individuals with specific medical conditions to use cannabis with the approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. The proposed revision overcame a major obstacle later in July when it won the support of the ministry, which said at the time it would permit Epidiolex, Marinol and Sativex for conditions including epilepsy, symptoms of HIV/AIDS and cancer-related treatments. On November 23, 2018, the National Assembly approved the amendments to the Narcotics Control Acts and medical cannabis was partially legalized.  Legal status  = Medical use = Use of medical cannabis is legal with the approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Currently, the ministry only allows Epidiolex, Marinol and Sativex. The plant itself alongside its natural derivatives and extract, despite legal under the law, has yet to be approved. Prior to obtaining the drug, patients are required to apply to the Korea Orphan Drug Center, a government body facilitating patient access to rare medicines, after receiving a doctor‚Äôs prescription. Approval will be granted on a case-by-case basis. The import of the drug is set to begin in early 2019, according to the ministry. = Recreational use = Despite the reform, recreational cannabis remains strictly forbidden by the law. A violation is punishable by up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won, about $44,000. South Korean authorities have repeatedly warned their citizens that they are subject to their country‚Äôs criminal code no matter where they are in the world and advised them to refrain from using cannabis abroad. Industrial hemp Cannabis has been a source of fabric for Korea since ancient times, and as recently as the 1930s hemp was grown in every province of Korea, particularly in the south where it grew best. In the late 1950s, 9,000 hectares of hemp were cultivated in South Korea. Economy A Korea Times article of 2014 noted that despite risks of a prison sentence of up to five years or a fine of up to 50 million won ($48,000), cannabis could be easily bought in South Korea by contacting dealers on the Internet. Its journalist noted that according to dealers, cannabis sold for US$30‚Äì50 per gram. In popular culture =Early Pop Stars= In the pursuit of scapegoats to increase the popularity of his 1976 Cannabis Control Act, South Korean President Park Chung-hee turned his gaze inwards, towards pop entertainers performing at U.S. Army bases, a hotbed of marijuana usage. In the winter of 1975, Park Chung-hee led a government crackdown on marijuana usage, resulting in the arrest of over 50 well known South Korean entertainers. Among them was the rock singer Shin Jung-hyeon, defamed in the media following his arrest as the \\"daemacho ringleader.\\" He was imprisoned for four months following his arrest. =K-Pop= A number of high profile K-Pop stars have been prosecuted for the recreational use of marijuana. Notable entertainers arrested for cannabis usage include Kim Kye-Hoon, better known by his rap name, Crown J, singer-songwriter Psy, and Big Bang's T.O.P. The celebrities received a variety of sentences, with prison time ranging from 25 days to 10 months. Along with legal action, societal backlash against the disgraced stars is often swift and serious. After T.O.P. was arrested for possession and usage of marijuana, his record label YG Entertainment became widely referred to as Yak Guk (Hangul: ÏïΩÍµ≠) Entertainment, which translates to \\"the drugstore.\\" With an average of 40 months following a drug related scandal for a Korean entertainer to return to the stage, K-Pop stars arrested for using cannabis have a difficult time regaining their lost stardom.

He chose not to seek re-election in 2017. Before serving as mayor, Harpole was an Amarillo City Councilmember from May 2005 to May 2007. Throughout his political career, Harpole has focused on improving downtown Amarillo. He is the vice-chairman of the downtown Center City Amarillo Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone board, which diverts property tax revenues in the zone to projects with the goal of improving the area. As mayor, he has explored plans to build a baseball stadium and a parking garage in Amarillo. However, the development partners that the city worked with for three years suddenly went out of business in January 2015, causing a setback. Harpole has also received media attention for his comments on refugees in Amarillo, which receives more refugees per capita than any other Texas city. He has expressed concern for the city's ability to accommodate the relatively large number, but has asserted that Amarillo is supportive and accepting of refugees. Personal life Harpole was born in Deer Lodge, Montana in 1950, and raised in Denver, Colorado. After finishing high school, he joined the U.S. Army in 1968. From 1969-1971, he served two tours of duty in the Vietnam War as a crew chief on a medevac helicopter. During his time in Vietnam, he received an Army Commendation Medal and nineteen Army Air Medals. After finishing his service, he enrolled in the University of New Mexico in 1971, where he was involved with Kappa Alpha. He graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the Anderson School of Management in 1976. Shortly after graduating, Harpole began selling cars at Frontier Ford in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1982, he moved to Amarillo, where he secured a position as vice president and general manager of John Chandler Ford. In 2009, he left John Chandler Ford and started his own auto dealership. Currently, Harpole is President of Paul Harpole Motors. Harpole and his wife Jenny have two children, Daniel and Amy. They have six grandchildren. Early political career Harpole was first elected to the Amarillo City Council as the Councilmember for Place 2, one of four City Council positions elected at-large by a majority of voters, in May 2005. He served a single two-year term. During his term, in 2006, the city's Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone for downtown Amarillo was created. When it was created, Harpole became the TIRZ board's vice-chairman, a role he maintains today. Mayor of Amarillo =First term= On January 11, 2011, Harpole announced that he intended to run for Mayor of Amarillo. He campaigned on a plan to revitalize the downtown area to increase sales tax revenues, to establish Tax Increment Reinvestment Zones in other parts of the city, and to tackle graffiti. Out of a field of 11 candidates, he won the election held on May 14, 2011, with 77 percent of the vote. His closest opponent, Roy D. McDowell, came in second with 13 percent of the vote. To keep his campaign promise to fight graffiti, Harpole created a graffiti task force a few months after taking office. The city appropriated $150,000 for the group's first year, and Amarillo National Bank donated an additional $50,000. On April 24, 2012, the Amarillo City Council unanimously approved an anti-graffiti ordinance that prohibited the position of spray cans by minors under 17, and gave the city the power to fine property owners who did not clean up graffiti. Commenting on the issue, Mayor Harpole said, \\"It's not a joke. You're a criminal\\". Focusing on a downtown revitalization, Harpole explored plans to build a baseball stadium in Amarillo. A November Convention Sports & Leisure study estimated the cost to be between $20 million and $30 million, but predicted a potential $88 billion increase in economic activity as a result. Harpole also toured Sugar Land, a city in the Houston metro area, along with other Amarillo city officials. Sugar Land city officials cited low crime, a major hotel, and low property tax rates as key to their city's redevelopment. In Sugar Land, Harpole met with former Sugar Land mayor David Wallace, and his business partner, Costa Bajjali, both principals of Wallace Bajjali Development Partners. In November 2011, the city approved a $947,000 payment to Wallace Bajjali and began talks on how to revitalize downtown Amarillo. 51 investors sued the group for losses of $3.1 million in an alleged ponzi scheme. In February 2012, the group agreed to settle the suit for about $1.2 million. The city continued doing business with the group. In September 2012, a city ordinance that banned texting and driving passed 15 months after Governor Rick Perry vetoed a similar state law. Harpole supported it, saying, \\"Today, none of us would think of getting into a car without airbags or seatbelts. To me, it's that kind of issue\\". =Second term= Mayor Harpole ran for a second term in the mayoral election held on May 10, 2013. He faced just one challenger, Terry Baughman, a lifelong Amarillo resident who worked as an assistant manager at Walgreens. Harpole campaigned on plans to build a major hotel, a parking garage, and a baseball stadium. Harpole claimed, \\"We'll see an increase. Not just in the property values, but an increase in use. More families, there's other things planned, parks\\". Baughman promised to improve areas of Amarillo outside of downtown, and criticized Harpole for not having a stronger water conservation plan. Harpole was re-elected with 83% of the vote. On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole spoke about the refugee population in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received the highest number of refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, \\"We've raised some red flags and said this isn't good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves\\". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed \\"it's going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well\\" in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, \\"We don't want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We've been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents\\". In November 2014, the city approved a $14.3 million parking garage, to be built by Wallace Bajjali Development Partners, the group that Harpole met in Sugar Land. The city also continued talks with the firm about a future baseball stadium. Harpole said, in August 2014, \\"This is one of the best public-private partnerships that could be imagined\\". However, in January 2015, the development group shut down without warning. The city had already spent $924,312.35 for work done during the planning stages. Amarillo declared the company in default of its contracts, and sued to recover $177,500 that had been set aside but not paid yet. In February 2016, the city decided to abandon the lawsuit and received $20,000 in attorney's fees, about 70% of the actual cost. In February 2015, Harpole sat down with NewsChannel 10 to show hundreds of pages of documents that the city reviewed to vet Wallace Bajjali prior to doing business with the group in 2011. Harpole defended the city's decision at the time, saying, \\"They looked at everything they could to say are these people reasonable, can they perform and [...] have they been honest in their past dealings. Every one of these (documents) says to move ahead\\". =Third term= On January 21, 2015, Harpole announced that he would run for a third term in the upcoming mayoral election. In his announcement, priorities that he cited included highway beautification, creating an additional Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, and adding to the city's water rights. He was opposed by Roy McDowell, who criticized Harpole's plan to build a ballpark, saying \\"We didn't get to vote on it, but I am going to make sure from here on out that people get to vote on all major issues\\". He also mentioned red light cameras, hand-held cell phones, animal control, and the drainage tax as additional issues he wished to put to a vote. Harpole won the May 9 election with 7568 votes, or 54%. In January 2016, Harpole was interviewed by conservative news site Watchdog.org about refugees in Amarillo. In the article, Harpole is quoted talking about \\"small ghettos\\" being created and \\"rival tribes\\" being settled together. Despite Harpole's assertion that he was misquoted, multiple conservative sites, including Breitbart News, picked up the story. Harpole insisted, \\"I have no concern about refugees and ones that have been here. I have always felt that they've been a big part and a good part of our community\\". Later, on April 21, 2016, Harpole testified in front of the Texas Senate on the issue, complaining that Amarillo has not \\"been involved in the consultation meetings [on refugee placement] at all\\". In Harpole's third term, councilmembers expressed the need to improve relationships between each other. On June 6, 2016, Harpole expressed concern about controversial Facebook posts, which contained ethnic and sexual slurs, by Sandra McCartt. She was a candidate to fill Harpole's former seat on the city council after his successor, Brian Eades, announced his resignation. The next day, Harpole walked out of a City Council executive session, accusing a councilmember of leaking the rankings of candidates to fill the position. He also alleged that councilmembers chastised him for changing the process for selecting Eades' replacement when he suggested bypassing the scheduled questioning of McCartt by the council, and ending her candidacy. Councilman Randy Burkett then admonished Harpole for publicly criticizing McCartt. Councilman Elisha Demerson said Harpole \\"owes it to the citizens of this community to be present\\", while Councilman Mark Nair criticized the mayor for not letting the selection process play out. Harpole defended himself, saying, \\"I am not going to be ruled by the process. I am ruled by my constituents\\". In November 2016, Interim City Manager Terry Childers called the city's politics \\"toxic\\" and \\"frustrating\\". These remarks followed his resignation after being caught denigrating a citizen speaker on a hot mic that month, and berating 911 dispatchers in February. In August 2016, Harpole asked the city council to consider starting a day labor program for Amarillo's homeless, modeled after Albuquerque's \\"There's a Better Way\\" program. That program employed the homeless in various beautification projects, like picking up trash and pulling weeds. In October 2016, the city approved $50,000 to fund a pilot program. The next mayoral election was held on May 6, 2017. Harpole did not seek a fourth term, and was succeeded by Ginger Nelson.

Cannabis possession is the most common drug offense on the island, and the annual prevalence of cannabis use amongst adults was reported as 10.8% in 2005. History Cannabis was introduced to Grenada by Indian indentured workers who first arrived in the country on 1 May 1857 to work on plantations. They referred to cannabis as \\"ganja\\" and used the intoxicant to prepare bhang, which they would consume to relax after working on the plantations. Rastafarian cannabis growers and distributors played in influential role in the 1979 socialist coup in Grenada. Nonetheless, just a few months following the 1979 Revolution, Grenada's Rastafari found themselves betrayed by the PRG's decision to clamp down on marijuana cultivation. The disillusionment was solidified in 1980, with the violent break-up of a demonstration by unregistered cannabis-growers. Economy Grenada produces some amount of cannabis, and also serves as a transshipment point for drugs to the United States and other markets. Cultivation remains small, in plots of 200‚Äì500 plants in remote areas with inaccessible terrain. In 2009, Grenadian authorities seized 460kg of cannabis, as well as 1,309 cannabis cigarettes. The Grenada Drug Information Network assessed in 2003 that 75 percent of the cannabis grown on Grenada is for local consumption, with the remainder trafficked abroad, particularly to Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Reform Following increased discussion in Caribbean Community (CARICOM) around the possibility of reforming cannabis laws, in 2014 Grenada's Education and Human Resource Development Minister clarified: \\"Government's position on this issue is very clear. The cultivation and use of marijuana in Grenada is illegal, and therefore, we will abide by the laws of our land\\".
