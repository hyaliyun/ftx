History  = 1973 to 2009 = Hanmi was founded in 1973 by Lim Sung-ki, who was a pharmacist. It was originally named Lim, Sung-ki Pharmaceutical Co., but it was quickly changed to Hanmi Pharmaceutical. The company originally started selling Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole powder, and would expand to produce Cephalosporin antibiotics in 1985 and injectable Ceftriaxone antibiotics in 1987. By 1988 the company was listed in the Korea Exchange. Hanmi started selling drugs in China in 1996. In 1994, the company began developing Cyclosporin. The company broke the barrier in sales in 1997. The company began moving into the European market in 1998. The company still was developing new drugs, with Paclitaxel in 2000, Itraconazole tablets in 2001, 24-hour controlled-release Nifedipine tablets and a new salt form of Amlodipine in 2004, and an anti-obesity drug using sibutramine mesilate in 2007. Hanmi and Crystal Genomics formed a strategic partnership in 2008. = 2010 and beyond = By around 2010, Hanmi's R&D; had two areas of interest: developing longer- lasting peptide and protein therapeutics using its \\"Lapscovery\\" technology, and developing small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its strategy was to developmental incremental modifications of existing drugs, create new combination drugs, and to develop novel drugs. In August 2014 Hanmi exclusively licensed rights in China for poziotinib, a small molecule EGFR inhibitor, to the Chinese company Luye Pharma; in February 2015 Hanmi licensed rights in the rest of the world outside of South Korea to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. In March 2015 Hanmi and Lilly signed an exclusive license outside of Asia for Hanmi's small molecule Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the field of autoimmune diseases; Lilly paid $50 million upfront and the deal included up to $640 million in milestones and royalties greater than 10%. In November 2015 Hanmi signed three agreements: * An exclusive license outside of South Korea and China with Sanofi for Hanmi's Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist drug candidates for diabetes; Sanofi paid $434 million upfront and up to $3.2 billion in milestones and royalties over 10%. The deal included efpeglenatide, a long- acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; an insulin intended to be delivered once per week, and a fixed-dosed weekly GLP1-RA/insulin drug combination. * An exclusive license outside of South Korea and China with the J&J; subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals for Hanmi's oxyntomodulin-analog metabolic disease programs, including HM12525A; J&J; paid $105 million upfront and the deal included $810M in milestones and royalties higher than 10% * An exclusive license in China with the Chinese company ZAI Labs for olmutinib. In April 2016 Hanmi announced that it had acquired land near Yantai in the Shandong province of China, where it would build a manufacturing plant and R&D; facility; at that time it already had a facility in Beijing. In July Hanmi said it intended to invest more heavily in developing candidate substances of promising new drugs at an early stage in new pharmaceutical and biotech related fields, including through a venture capital firm set up by Sung-ki and colleagues. In May 2016 the Korean regulatory authority approved olmutinib as a second-line treatment for certain kinds of non-small cell lung cancer. On September 28 Hanmi and Zentec Pharmaceuticals agreed that Zentec would market Hanmi's small molecule cancer drug candidate, HM95573; Zentec paid $80 million upfront, with $830 million in milestones, and royalties. On September 29, Hanmi and Roche's cancer subsidiary Genentech announced a deal for Hanmi's Phase I cancer drug candidate, HM95573, which targets the MAPK/ERK pathway; Roche agreed to pay $80 million upfront, and the deal included $830 million in milestones. In December 2016 the Sanofi deal was reduced in scope, with Hanmi receiving back rights to the once-weekly insulin and the combination GLP1-RA/insulin product, and agreeing to repay Sanofi $250 million of the $434 million upfront payment. On December 3, 2019 Rapt Therapeutics and Hanami Pharmaceutical announced collaboration to develop and commercialize FLX475 in Asia.FLX475 is an oral, small molecule CCR4 antagonist in development for the treatment of multiple cancers. In August 2020, Chairman and founder of Hanmi Pharmaceutical Lim Sung-ki died of a chronic disease. He was 80.  Controversies  = Employee insider trading scandal = On the evening of September 29, 2016, Hanmi announced the Roche deal, causing its stock to rise; Hanmi was notified by Boehringer that evening that Boehringer was terminating their deal, and the company announced the termination on the morning of the 30th, causing its stock to crash. Hanmi's offices were raided by Korean regulatory authorities in mid-October based on evidence that insider knowledge of the Boehringer termination was passed to third parties, who shorted the stock prior to the announcement on the 30th. In December three Hanmi employees were among 17 people indicted for insider trading; 25 people were fined, and 45 people were found to have made illegal trades that took around 3.3 billion won ($2.83 million) in profits based on the information. = Olmutinib safety concerns = On September 30, 2016, Korean regulatory authorities issued a safety alert about olmutinib in which it described two cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis, one of which was fatal, and a case of Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome; Boeheringer announced the termination its deal with Hanmi the same day, citing that the decision came after a review of \\"all available clinical data\\" on the drug, and also referring to competing drugs. In April 2018 Hanmi was found to have violated two laws in Korea by not disclosing adverse effects of olmutinib sooner. In that month Zai said it was dropping olmutinib and a few days later Hanmi said it was terminating development of the drug.

This pathway is distinct from conventional sound pathways such as air or bone. Therefore, cartilage conduction it referred to as the third auditory pathway. Overview Since approximately 450 years ago, two pathways have been acknowledged for transmitting sound to the inner ear; one is air conduction and the other is bone conduction. In 2004, Hiroshi Hosoi, a professor at Nara Medical University, discovered the phenomenon of cartilage vibration in the inner ear.Hosoi H, Yanai S, Nishimura T, et al. Development of cartilage conduction hearing aid, Archives of Materials Science and Engineering 2010; 42: 104-110 By attaching a vibrator to aural cartilage, sound was found be transmitted into the inner ear well. He proposed the novel concept that cartilage has a unique characteristic capable of transmitting sound. Because sound transmission via pathways that use air or bone are respectively called air conduction and bone conduction, the new pathway is referred to as cartilage conduction. This unique pathway has attracted the attention of several researchers and companies such that some hearing aid prototypes using cartilage conduction have been tested for use in smartphone and earphone. Cartilage conduction in daily life One can hear a leathery sound when cleaning one's ear canal using a cotton-tipped swab. This is an example of sound transmitted via cartilage conduction. In cartilage conduction, sound (vibration) energy stimulates the cartilages of the external auditory canal and induces air vibration. This air vibration can be then transmitted into the inner ear via the eardrum and middle ear, which in turn activates the cochlear nerve. Air vibration created from cartilage conduction is combined with sound from air conduction at the ear canal, and thus an amplified sound is perceived. This same phenomenon can be experienced when a telephone receiver is pressed against one's ear when it is difficult to hear the person on the other end of the call. Practical tools utilizing cartilage conduction 1) Hearing aid Cartilage conduction can be particularly useful for patients with disorders of the outer ear, including aural atresia, where conventional air conduction hearing aids cannot be used. The basic premise of cartilage conduction hearing aids is that cartilage located outside the ear canal is vibrated, such that the vibration can be transmitted despite the presence of any outer ear disorders. Because hearing contributes to language development, the practical availability of cartilage conduction hearing aids would be beneficial to children who suffer from disorders of the outer ear. Currently, a cartilage conduction hearing aid is being developed by RION CO., LTD. 2) Smartphone/Cell phone Recently, a smartphone prototype using the benefits of cartilage conduction has been manufactured by ROHM Co., Ltd.Tanaka, M. Application of Cartilage Conduction to Smart-phone. Proc. of 20th International Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (IFOS) World congress, No. ME72805 (2013) This type of the smartphone provides clearer sound compared with conventional phones, even under noisy circumstances. Furthermore, the sound pressure level can be easily modified by adjusting the physical pressure level of the smartphone pressed against the outer ear. Importantly, the cartilage vibration, which is a sound source, can be heard only by oneself but not by others because sound from cartilage vibration cannot be leaked outside. This makes talking in public easy. In addition, the smartphone's surface can be kept clean because one's face or ear does not directly contact the smartphone's surface. The cartilage conduction phone can also be used simultaneously with conventional air conduction hearing aids, which is good news for hearing-impaired people. 3) Earphone The ear canal is not physically occluded by an earphone that operates via cartilage conduction. As such, this type of earphone allows one to hear alarm signals. Similar to the cartilage conduction smartphones, no sound is leaked from this type of earphone. Prototypes of such earphones have been manufactured by ROHM Co, Ltd. 4) Robot Cartilage conduction has been considered for communicating with robots. Currently, loudspeaker systems are used to convey sounds produced by robots. However, such loudspeakers generate loud noises in a room filled with many robots that simultaneously emit speech sounds. Therefore, a man-to- man communication system is needed to overcome this problem. Cartilage conduction can realize better communication than loudspeaker systems. Cartilage conduction is distinct from bone conduction It was initially thought that cartilage conduction was a type of bone conduction. However, several studies demonstrated that the mechanisms of cartilage conduction differ from that of bone conduction.Nishimura T, Hosoi H, Saito O, et al. Is cartilage conduction classified into air or bone conduction? Laryngoscope 2014; 124:1214-1219Shimokura R, Hosoi H, Nishimura T, et al. Cartilage conduction hearing. J.Acoust.Soc.Am. 2014; 135(4):1959-1966 Bone conduction is attributed to bone vibration at the skull, which is transmitted to the inner ear. In contrast, cartilage conduction is accounted for by sound (vibration) energy stimulating the cartilage at the external auditory canal to create sonic waves in the ear canal. Such sonic wave energy passes through the eardrum and the middle ear before finally activating the auditory nerve. These different mechanisms would explain the following observed differences between cartilage and bone pathways: 1\\\\. A variety of sound pressure levels can be created by contact pressure in cartilage conduction compared with that in bone conduction. 2\\\\. A sound in cartilage conduction is more stereophonic than that in bone conduction. 3\\\\. Frequency characteristics are different between cartilage and bone conduction.

It was designed by Wright, Powell and Cameron (the firm headed by James William Wright). The lobby has a sweeping staircase constructed by local craftsmen from jarrah timber salvaged from the Mechanics Institute building, which had been demolished to make way for the Town Hall. During construction the last of six large steel principals in the main section of the hall still had to be secured firmly but lunchtime came and the workmen took lunch. During lunch a willy- willy brought down the unsecured principal and with it, the other five. All had to be completely replaced.Adelphe King and Elizabeth Parker, York, Western Australia's First Inland Town, Parker Print, 2007, p.9. The Town Hall was opened on 30 November 1911 by the newly elected Labor Premier Jack Scadden.AM (Tony) Clack and Jenni McColl, York Sketchbook, The York Society, 2003, p.2. Historian Tony Clack comments: \\"...the erection of the Town Hall was York's swan song. Two and a half year's later the world was at war and York never recovered the confidence that was expressed in the construction of the Town Hall.\\" The cost of construction was ¬£9,027 for which the Council borrowed ¬£7,000, and for many years, the Council struggled to pay the debt on the loans. It was designed to be large enough to generate income from renting the hall to travelling picture-show men and was utilised as a picture show venue early in its history. In 1926, the Town Hall was condemned by the Public Health Department and was closed down, due to a settling of the foundations. To remedy this, expensive steel reinforcing was introduced to support the walls, and steel braces and ties were installed on the roof trusses.

The temple is associated with Shingon Buddhism and has as its main image a sculpture of the Thousand-armed Kannon. It is the fifth temple on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage.  Overview  The temple was founded on the order of Emperor Sh≈çmu in 725 and consecrated by the monk Gy≈çki. It became part of a system of provincial temples (Kokubun-ji) founded by the state with the purpose of providing prayers and other services for the protection of the nation and the Imperial House. Archaeological finds on the temple grounds confirm the foundation of the temple in the 8th century and the connection to the Fujii family, descendants of the royal house of Baekje, which had migrated to Japan. The temple was promoted by the imperial family through the centuries. Renovations are known by Prince Abo in 806 and by Ariwara no Narihira. Among the patrons of the temple was the Heian period politician Sugawara no Michizane. In 1096, Fujii Yasumoto had a number of buildings restored. The Emperors Go-Daigo and Go-Murakami are said to have been admirers of the temple's main image. The temple was destroyed by earthquake in 1510 and renovated in 1602 by Toyotomi Hideyori. The four gates of the temple date from this time. The present main hall was completed in 1776. The main image is a seated sculpture of a thousand-armed and eleven-headed Kannon, produced in a dry lacquer technology, and designated as a National Treasure of Japan. The statue has a total of 1041 arms: 2 main arms with the hand palms facing each other in front of the statue, 38 large and 1001 small arms extending from behind the body.

W.\\" Lapian (30 June 1892 ‚Äì 5 April 1977) was a nationalist involved in the struggle for Indonesian independence. He published several newspapers that gave voice to the welfare of the Indonesian people and promoted Indonesian nationalism. He was also part a group who established a separate Christian denomination from the official Dutch East-Indies church institution. After Indonesia gained its independence, Lapian served as head of the district (or mayor) of Manado and acting governor of Sulawesi. In 2015, he was given the title of \\"National Hero of Indonesia\\" by President Joko Widodo.  Early life  Bernard Wilhelm Lapian was born in Kawangkoan on 30 June 1892 to Enos Lapian and Petronella Geertruida Mapaliey. Lapian went to the Dutch language elementary school (Amurangse School) in Amurang, about 40 kilometers from Kawangkoan. He would continue to take courses up to the level of junior secondary school (MULO or Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs).  Journalist, politician, and church leader  = Publications = Lapian was 17 in 1909 when he started working at the Dutch shipping company KPM (Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij).

Later in 1940, he would publish a local paper in Kawangkoan called Semangat Hidoep. = The People's Representative = Lapian served as a representative of the people in two capacities, one regional and another for the entire Dutch East Indies. From 1930 to 1942, he was a member of the local council called Dewan Minahasa (or Minahasaraad) in Manado. Members of this council represented the people throughout the region of Minahasa. In 1938, Lapian also became a member of People's Council for the Dutch East Indies (or Volksraad) in Batavia and aligned himself with the nationalist caucus that was led by Mohammad Husni Thamrin. = Convention of Protestant Churches in Minahasa = Lapian was part of a group of church leaders and nationalists (including Sam Ratulangi and A.A. Maramis) who wanted a church denomination that was free and separate from the official church institution of the Dutch East-Indies (called Protestantsche Kerk in Nederlandsch-Indie or Indische Kerk). In March 1933, the independent Convention of Protestant Churches in Minahasa or Kerapatan Gereja Protestan Minahasa (KGPM) was established and Lapian was named secretary.

This started the Indonesian National Revolution. On 14 February 1946, indigenous members of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (or KNIL) in Manado with the assistance of local youth and freedom fighters captured the Dutch officers of KNIL. On 16 February 1946, Lapian who was the head of the district of Manado at that time was named the head of the government of the Republic of Indonesia in North Sulawesi.

With the trio running in the top three, a late-race downpour on the Saturday saw all three drivers, amongst many others, hit the wall at Turn 5. Dick Johnson Racing, unlike Triple Eight and Ford Performance Racing, crucially managed to get Courtney on track in time to score points. This gave Courtney the advantage heading into the Sunday race, in which his 14th-place finish was sufficient to secure his maiden championship. Meanwhile, the Saturday race was won by Tekno Autosports' Jonathon Webb, who had only started 21st after a qualifying crash. Webb survived the chaos during the late-race rain to take his first race victory narrowly ahead of Jason Bright. Lee Holdsworth, who started both races on pole, won the Sunday race, after taking the lead from the low-on-fuel Shane van Gisbergen on the final lap. Steven Richards finished second, in his final full-time drive in the championship.

He had many artistic talents. He played the violin. He also was a woodworker and designed furniture. He also designed and built his own powerboat, and it is believed that he was the first African American yachtsman in Buffalo. He was also a member of Michigan Avenue Baptist Church and Michigan Avenue YMCA.  Early life  Crawford was born September 22, 1910, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In 1917, he moved with his family to Buffalo, New York. He spent his days in Buffalo and he graduated from the Albright Art School. He grew up during the time of the Harlem Renaissance, which had made an impact of his career later on in life. In high school, Crawford took a Saturday morning painting class at the Albright Art Gallery. He received a one-year scholarship to the Albright Art School, and he graduated in 1932. Eventually, he married a woman named Vera Jane Patterson.  Career  Crawford was a painter and made many murals throughout his lifetime. Due to the fact that he lived through the Harlem Renaissance, he was chosen to do a mural for a popular jazz nightclub in Buffalo, called the Moonglow. It was a nightclub aimed towards African Americans. He painted a mural on the inside and outside of The Moonglow. In 1939, the US Army hired Crawford to paint a mural in remembrance of World War I in the Officers Club Building of Fort Niagara State Park. The mural was 28 feet long but 20 feet high. The mural pays tribute to the Battle of Cantigny, the first battle that was led and fought by only Americans. In 1940, Hubert was hired to create a mural for the American Negro Exposition in Chicago. The mural was to honor the 75th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Crawford worked with many different types of arts. He also created graphic arts and cartooning. He became a professor at the University of Buffalo.  Death  In 1940, Crawford's life took a turn for the worst. He was in the attic of his home when he fell from the third-story window. He suffered much trauma from the fall, and it left him impaired for the remainder of his life. He resided at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center. He continued to create works while he was there, but his other works were not remembered the way they used to be. In 1977, he was moved to a senior center in Hamburg, New York. On January 11, 1985, Crawford died in a nursing home in Utica, New York.  Artist legacy  After Crawford's death, his work seemed to have to been forgotten. In an article in The Buffalo News, Robert Emerson, executive director of Old Fort Niagara said \\"He was well known in the 1930s but is forgotten today.\\" His mural in the Officer's Club was restored by SUNY Buffalo State‚Äôs Art Conservation Department. Emerson hopes to make Crawford's name well known again, and he had plans to display his mural of the Battle of Contigny in a side room at Fort Niagara with other artifacts to remember the World Wars.

The organization focuses on human rights on the local and international level. It also focuses on rights for minority groups within Iraq like Yezidis, Sabian, Mandaen, Turkoman, Assyrians, Armenians and more. Its goal is to provide not only documentation for human rights abuses but also to provide humanitarian aid in Iraq. It focuses on vulnerable groups that are more likely to have their rights violated like children and women. To raise awareness about the issues HHRO publishes an annual report on the human rights situation in Iraq. It looks at what are the violations and who are the violators.  History  The ideal of creating the Hammurabi Human Rights organization first started in mid-2003 after there was a shift in the government of Iraq. Mr. William Warda and Ms. Pascale Warda started the organization in the Nineveh region of Iraq. Their goal was to get activist involved and to try to expand civil society. They saw that there was a lack of security and more acts of human rights violation across Iraq and decided to act. It was not until April 1, 2005, that the organization would become an NGO. With the Wardas' coordination, it was able to get activists on board with their ideal and formed an official NGO to promote and protect human rights in Iraq.  Purpose  The primary purpose of the Hammurabi Human Rights Organization is to defend human rights on the domestic level (regional and national) then on the international level. To do so, it concentrates on tracking Iraqi government policy and the international treaties that Iraq has signed and ratified. The HHRO monitors the implication of those policies and international treaties, while at the same time trying to watch over the legislative, executive and judicial branches to make sure that none violates human rights. They also work with Iraqi communities to educate them on the importance of human rights, especially for vulnerable groups. To do so, they produce annual reports to showcase the violation of human rights of the Iraqi people and foreigners living in the country. By organizing seminars and workshops they provide opportunities to educate and raise awareness of core human rights issues. The organization also tries to prevent future human rights violations by raising awareness among the three branches of government. HHRO has also developed, during the years since its creation, key partnership with other organizations in the region to further advance in their goals.  Funding and Membership  Most of the funding for the organization comes from donations from across the world. All are welcome to join the organization by completing a form. The board of directors are responsible for admitting new members and can have up to 10% of the total amount in the organization.  Staff  The HHRO was created by Pascale Warda, a former Iraqi Minister for Displacement and Migration. Pascale Warda is an Assyrian and Catholic Iraqi, born in Dahuk. She has worked with many organizations before creating the HHRO: Assyrian Women's Union, Assyrian Aid Society-Iraq and the Iraqi Women's Center for Development situated in Baghdad. The co-founder of HHRO is her husband William Warda. He has also been part of different human rights group in the region like Alliance of Iraqi Minorities. William Warda also played a political role in the early 2000s. He served as the leader of the political and military department for the Assyrian Democratic Movement.  Projects  = Annual reports = Since 2007, the HHRO have published annual reports on the human rights situation in Iraq. Each year they focused on a key element in Iraqi society . The 2007 and 2009 reports were short and focused on human rights violations affecting Christians in Iraq. They denounced the decline security situation of the country and a lack of government efforts to stop these violations. To obtain their data they relied on statistics that they researched themselves. The 2011, 2014 and 2015 reports focused on all minority groups and human rights violations committed against these groups, not just on Christian groups. From this point onward, the organization focused strongly on minority groups and how the geopolitical situation of Iraq affected them. The 2016 report once again shifted in its content to focus on all human rights abuses in Iraq. It looks at how the group Islamic State (IS) has affected the human rights situation. The organization also focuses on internally displaced people. = Christian Solidarity = HHRO joined Christian Solidarity International (CSI) in efforts to visit and organize the distribution of relief aid to internally displaced people (IDPs) in the region of Mosul and Baghdad. The relief aid consisted of essential goods for the population like food, milk and more. HHRO sees the opportunity to work with other NGOs in the region as a way to demonstrate that they are committed to help prevent and bring relief to all ethnic groups in the country. HHRO has also played a role with CSI in helping and providing aid to Christian minority group fleeing the terror group IS in Iraq.CSI responds to ISIS threat. (2014, July 11).

Their partnership has influenced Christian groups across the region that were under IS rules. = Ceasefire Project = The Ceasefire project is a programme supported by the European Union that monitors human rights abuses in Iraq. The goal of the project is that NGOs and civilian monitors the human rights abuses. The project focuses on groups such as women, children, ethnic and religious minorities, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and more. By doing so, the project hopes to entrust NGOs with the power and the capacity to create a system that can help these affected groups by the situation in Iraq. HHRO is a main contributor to the project. Its task is to research, find, help promote human rights and to try to assist those who have been victims of human rights abuses. = Anticipating future human rights violation = HHRO has noted that the advance of military force to defeat IS will not necessarily resolve human right violations against minorities. William Warda, co-founder of the organization, has stated that most Internally Displaced People (IDP) from Mosul would not come back if the coalition forces recaptured Mosul.Post-Mosul Campaign Guarantees for Religious Minorities Crucial, Says Iraqi Human Rights Leader.

Warda points out the historical facts of the country, stating that since Iraqi's independence in 1932 minority groups such has Christian and Yazidis had suffered atrocities. = Ethnic context = HHRO started out promoting and safeguarding Assyrian and Christians minority human rights but quickly expanded to cover all minority groups in Iraq, especially with the rise of the Islamic State in the region. To help achieve this goal, they have worked closely with the CeaseFire Project. They have also expanded their reach within Iraq with this project. HHRO is able, with the CeaseFire Project, to help distant minority groups that live in a rural parts of Iraq or in the midst of a military conflict.  U.S. Partners  HHRO has an active role in broadcasting human rights violations against minority groups conducted by the terror group IS in Iraq. It has teamed up with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to help relay information about the ongoing situation.TESTIMONY OF SENIOR DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR THOMAS STAAL BEFORE THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON AFRICA, GLOBAL HEALTH, HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA.

Other Partners  HHRO is a regional organization focused on the promotion and protection of human rights in Iraq. It has worked with the United States government to help further its agenda since the U.S. was and still is a major player in Iraq. HHRO does not have many international partners. It has been to Jordan to promote its agenda but not to monitor the situation of refuge camps. HHRO has also worked with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  Awards  In 2013, United States Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns gave the award of Human Rights Defenders to the Hammurabi Human Rights Organization stating that the group demonstrated effectiveness in advocacy for human rights, achievement in protecting female prisoners, and important work in trying to improve religious freedom in Iraq. The group was praised for not only defending human rights and reporting on human rights abuses, but also seeking solutions. It was stated that they are one of the few groups in Iraq that understand that if they want to see real change they have to work with the government and not only oppose it. The award was received by William Warda, Pascale Warda and 13 members of the organization that came from Iraq. This award is given every year to an NGO or activity that demonstrates exceptional work in advocating and playing a leadership role in the protection of human rights.Washington: Deputy Secretary of State Burns Presents Human Rights Defender Award to the Hammurabi Human Rights Organization.

In addition it holds a number of Important Cultural Property structures and artworks.  History  Prince Sh≈çtoku is said to have been the founder of the temple. It is certain that there has been a place of prayer at the site since the end of the Heian period. The actual construction took place from 1306 with the construction of the main hall (hon-d≈ç).

Released on 19 February 2012, it also marks the reunion of the band's original line-up following the return of lead singer Nigel Clark who had left during the band's commercial peak in 1998. Background Following Nigel Clark's departure in 1998 to work on solo projects, Mathew Priest and Andy Miller continued as Dodgy with new singer Dave Bassey, keyboardist Chris Hallam and bassist Nick Abnett, releasing the fan-funded album Real Estate in 2001 before going inactive.. Meanwhile, Clark moved from London to the Midlands; recorded a self-financed solo album, Make Believe Love, which ended up unreleased; moved to Ireland where he worked at factories, then relocated to Worcestershire where he opened a recording studio and worked with troubled children; and finally released his solo debut album 21st Century Man in 2006. On 25 November 2006, a benefit concert was held for Andy Moore, Dodgy's former lighting technician who had been diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor. Clark was one of the performers on the bill, and during his set he was joined by Priest, the first time the two had performed together in almost a decade. This was the catalyst for the original Dodgy line-up of Clark, Priest and Miller to reunite, especially since Moore had always urged them to get back together. Moore ultimately died on the day of the reunited band's first rehearsal. The band's reunion tour was scheduled to kick off in Glasgow on 5 November 2007, but the day before the first show Miller fell out of bed and chipped a bone in his left forearm, forcing the tour to be cancelled. The reunion tour finally commenced on March 2008, with the band dedicating it to the memory of Andy Moore. Recording The album was recorded during the summer of 2011 at Clark's studio in Worcestershire, an old farmhouse with a view of the Malvern Hills where the band had been working on new material since 2007. The album was mixed by Matt Pence, who was recommended by Simon Raymonde and had gained Dodgy's appreciation for his most recent work with John Grant and Midlake.

It claims this is a growing problem gone mostly unpunished in Canada. Real estate In Transparency International Canada's 2017 report on their 2016 investigation, \\"No Reason to Hide: Unmasking the anonymous owners of Canadian companies and trusts\\", it was revealed \\"that no one really knew who owned almost half of Vancouver‚Äôs most valuable properties, as the true owners were hiding behind shell companies, trusts and nominee owners.\\" The report suggested that lawyers are often used to launder money in Canada and that almost half of Vancouver's 100 most expensive homes were bought using methods that obscure the identity of the buyer. Research by TIC showed that between 29 and half of the 100 most valuable residential properties in the Greater Vancouver area are owned using methods that obscure the identity of the buyer, and that four are registered in offshore jurisdictions.

They released two albums, The Happening Thang (June 1989) and Saddlepop (1990), on Trafalgar/WEA.  History  The Happening Thang were an Australian country pop group, which formed in 1988 in Sydney by Ricky Cole on drums, Jeff Mercer on guitar, mandolin and dobro, David Patterson on bass guitar and vocals, Rose Pearse on vocals, Andy Travers on guitar, vocals and harmonica, and Cathy Wearne on fiddle and vocals. In 1983 Travers had been a drummer for Adelaide- based group, the Spitfires, before he relocated to Sydney. There, he was a member of a rockabilly group, the Milky Bar Kids, on guitar from 1984 to 1986. While a still member of the Happening Thang, Travers guested on drums on Neil Murray's debut album, Calm and Crystal Clear (April 1989).McFarlane, 'Neil Murray' entry. Archived from the original on 1 September 2004. Retrieved 16 December 2016. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how the Happening Thang, \\"combined Hank Williams-style country roots with pop melodies to produce an uplifting, Australian urban and western sound. Other influences included Gram Parsons, Jimmie Rodgers and early Elvis Presley.\\" They issued their debut single, \\"I Don't Wanna Work\\" in February 1989. At the Australasian Country Music Awards, in January of the following year, they won New Talent of the Year for the song. Kathryn Whitfield of The Canberra Times, in March 1989, had felt that \\"I Don't Wanna Go to Work\\" was \\"repetitive garble. Twanging, monotonous tripe, which even the most ardent of country and western (or both) fans would find hard to bear. It's very Australia, very country, but very boring!\\" Their second single, \\"Drive Away\\", appeared in July 1989 and was followed in December by an eponymous album on Trafalgar/WEA. Most of its tracks were written by Travers. For that album the line-up of the group was Mercer, Patterson, Travers and Wearne, which was augmented by additional musicians: Pearse on vocals and bass guitar, Kathy Bluff on fiddle, Murray Cook on piano, Jim Niven on piano accordion, Dave Faulkner on piano, Peter O'Doherty on backing vocals, Ian Simpson on pedal steel guitar, Robert Souter on drums, and Bruce Thorburn on fiddle. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990 it was nominated for Best Country Album. They appeared on the 1990 compilation album Breaking Ground - New Directions in Country Music which was nominated for the same award in 1991. The Happening Thang's second album, Saddlepop (1990), provided a single: their cover version of Neil Young's \\"The Losing End\\". For this album the group's core members were Michael Kerin on fiddle, Mercer on electric guitar, mandolin, dobro and backing vocals, Patterson on bass guitar and backing vocals, Ross on drums, Travers on lead vocals, electric, rhythm, and acoustic guitars, and Wearne on backing vocals. They were assisted in the studio by Bluff and Cook; it was co-produced by Rod Coe and the band. After the group disbanded Travers joined Dog Trumpet, in 1995, on drums, alongside that band's founders O'Doherty on guitar, mandolin and bass guitar, and his brother, Reg Mombassa on guitar and lead vocals. They were joined by Amanda Brown on violin and backing vocals (ex-The Go-Betweens). That line-up issued an album, Suitcase (January 1996). In the mid-2000s Mercer and Patterson formed a country music group, the Cartwheels, in Hepburn Springs. The line-up included Patterson's wife, Wendy Phypers, on rhythm guitar and vocals, and their son, Charley Phypers, on drums.

This piece is credited as the first postminimal piece of music, and it is his most frequently heard work. The Time Curve Preludes were composed between 1977 and 1978 on a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. They were premiered at Wesleyan University in 1979 by pianist Neely Bruce. Duckworth used elements of Minimalism, including repetition and accessible harmonies, yet also embraced more quickly changing structures; wide-ranging, complex melodies; and colorful dissonances. Description The Time Curve Preludes is a set of 24 short pieces for piano, and has been described by music critic Kyle Gann as the first work of postminimalism.Kyle Gann discusses Duckworth on Arts Journal, accessed 16 February 2010 The harmonic language is more active than preexisting minimalist conventions and doesn't satisfy the established expectations of minimalist practice.Byelick, \\"Duckworth: Time Curve Preludes,\\" American Record Guide (Mar.-Apr. 2012): 89, GALEA281901288. Along with its elements of minimalism, the preludes utilize many references to piano music of earlier periods, a tenet of postmodernism. The music makes reference to folk music, jazz, medieval music, Erik Satie, banjo strumming, and the style of Jerry Lee Lewis.Jonathan W. Bernard, ‚ÄúMinimalism, Postminimalism, and the Resurgence of Tonality in Recent American,‚Äù American Music, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Spring, 2003): 128.William Duckworth, The Time Curve Preludes, Neely Bruce (piano), 1979, CD2031 7-4529-52031-2-4, compact disc (liner notes by Kyle Gann). One of the facets of earlier minimalism is the lack of explicit structure, while this set of pieces are of much more recognizable structure, including the division of 24 separate preludes. The number of preludes itself is a reference to Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, though it doesn't utilize every key as does the Well- Tempered Clavier. The composer also uses the Fibonacci series in developing proportional and rhythmic patterns, which were set out with the use of a numerical grid. The use of the Fibonacci sequence is not unique and appears in Bartok's music as well, and Duckworth's use of bitonality in Prelude No. 7 seems to be referential of Darius Milhaud's music. Most central to the piece is the Dies Irae, which is transformed into a major variant and serves as the central motive of the piece.

She showed an interest in technology from an early age, specializing in maths at high school and working on a special project in aerodynamics. She was always interested in the family's car and motorcycles. While studying English in England, she spent her free time observing the planes at Croydon Airport and Biggin Hill, famous for its wartime activities. Her first flight was in Sweden in an old two-seater SK 16. She then embarked on a course in physics at Lund University. In the summer vacation of 1962, she was the first woman to be admitted to the Swedish Air Force's training school at V√§ster√•s where she spent most of her time in the central workshop in Arboga training as a flight engineer. The only woman in a group of 30, she returned to the Air Force school for the summers of 1963 and 1964 qualifying as a flight engineer. But she realized she would never be admitted to serve in the Air Force. As a result, she decided to continue her academic studies, eventually graduating from Lund in mathematical physics.

The album was released on February 6, 1996, via Columbia. On this record Blanchard joins with a team that includes Ivan Lins, Paulinho da Costa, and Oscar Castro-Neves. In 1997, the album was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album. Critical reception Scott Yanow of Allmusic noted \\"Although trumpeter Terence Blanchard gets first billing on this recording, it is very much a joint effort with singer-composer Ivan Lins. Not only are all 13 songs by Lins but he sings on all but the three instrumentals although sometimes just wordlessly in the background. Blanchard often harmonizes with Lins' voice, creating a melancholy and dreamy atmosphere. Most selections feature Blanchard's regular rhythm section of the time, augmented by Paulinho Da Costa's percussion and occasionally Oscar Castro-Neves' acoustic guitar.\\" A reviewer of All About Jazz commented \\"This album is for late, late night listening 'round midnight' and is guaranteed to soothe away the stress and strain of the day. This music will caress you like waves washing onto the shore on a summer's evening. If you like your contemporary jazz with more bounce to the ounce, \\"The Heart Speaks\\" is definitely not for you\\". A reviewer of The Los Angeles Times stated \\"Blanchard has taken a particularly unusual route with \\"The Heart Speaks.\\" It would not, in fact, have been inappropriate to list the album as a collaboration between the trumpeter and Brazilian singer-songwriter Ivan Lins. Every piece was written by Lins, and with the exception of the title tune and one other, he sings on every track. Further escalating the commercial risks of the project, Lins‚Äîunlike Astrud Gilberto, who sang in English on her early bossa nova recordings with Stan Getz‚Äîings entirely in Portuguese. Despite the relative unfamiliarity of the material, the combination works surprisingly well. Blanchard's large, resonant tone provides a warm, lush contrast to Lins' gentle but emotionally penetrating vocal style. If there is a problem, it is in the occasionally clattering rhythm playing, which too often sounds ponderous and root-bound in comparison to the soaring eloquence of the dialogue between Lins and Blanchard.\\" Track listing Tracks 8 and 9 are dedicated to Nana Caymmi and Zimbo Trio.

Although this welcome spreads to anyone who may need it, the charity and movement mainly looks at the inclusion of asylum seekers and refugees. They celebrate the skills refugees and asylum seekers bring with them and provide a platform for their engagement with their locality and for their voices to be heard. They are a movement built by the grass roots, from the communities who wish to change things where they are, rather than a top down approach. Story City of Sanctuary began in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire in 2005 by Craig Barnett and Inderjit Bhogal. In 2007, with the support of the City Council and over 70 local community organisations, Sheffield became the UK‚Äôs first ‚ÄòCity of Sanctuary‚Äô ‚Äì \\"a city that takes pride in the welcome it offers to people in need of safety.\\" With the success of Sheffield, the movement then spread, with cities such as Leeds and Swansea starting their own groups to try and create an atmosphere where the refugees and asylum seekers living there could feel welcomed. As the movement grew, City of Sanctuary became a registered charity, helping to spread the movement and to connect groups to support one another. By early 2015 there were around 30 groups across the UK and Ireland, and the organisation had built a Sanctuary Alliance with other notable organisations in the UK sector, such as Refugee Council, British Red Cross, Refugee Action, Student Action for Refugees and many more. They had successfully pulled off an event in parliament, Sanctuary in Parliament, which allowed refugees and asylum seekers to share their stories in the place decisions are made, and to invite their MPs to come and listen and talk to them. They had also been a major part of organising the Sanctuary Summit in 2014, where The Birmingham Declaration was written. In September 2015, when the picture of Aylan Kurdi hit the media, City of Sanctuary was overwhelmed with new groups of people wishing to help in the refugee crisis which was now so apparent. The charity was chosen to be included in the 2015 Guardian Christmas Appeal, #WeStandTogether and over the next few months the movement grew to include over 60 groups . Rather than just being cities, there were now groups springing up in towns, villages, valleys, boroughs, counties and places of all sorts. At the time of writing there are well over 80 groups, all committed to trying to spread a culture of welcome where they are, however they can. Streams of Sanctuary City of Sanctuary has \\"Streams\\" of Sanctuary which different groups can engage in. ‚ÄúStreams of Sanctuary‚Äù link people and organisations within a city or across cities around a particular theme. A Stream may link professionals working to embed the concepts of welcome, safety and inclusion within their sectors and organisations, with interested individuals and other groups. The Stream can also enable the sharing of best practice, resources and ideas. This is happening in many cities, in areas like Schools, Health, Maternity, Faiths and Arts. Anyone can set up a Stream of Sanctuary in any area to help progress welcome and inclusion for asylum seekers, refugees and vulnerable newcomers.\\" As well as in cities, the streams happen on a national level, with Maternity, Health and School conferences taking place that transcend any particular locality. A new stream, \\"Universities\\", is now inviting universities to try and make their institution a place of sanctuary, working with Student Action for Refugees and the Equal Access to Higher Education Working Group to try and help refugees access university and feel welcome there. There is also the \\"Sanctuary Breaks\\" stream, where groups help provide weekends and trips away from the city that people are often stuck in, to provide respite and well being for refugees and asylum seekers. In 2015 the first sports \\"Club of Sanctuary\\" was awarded in Brighton. Birmingham Declaration At the Sanctuary Summit in 2014, people from across the UK refugee sector came together to sign an promote the Birmingham Declaration. Please see below for the full declaration. This declaration has been signed by over 250 different organisations. Sanctuary in Parliament Every year since 2014 City of Sanctuary has hosted an event in parliament with the help of the APPG on Refugees. This is an event which invites refugees and asylum seekers from across the UK to meet with their MP and to let their voices be heard in Westminster. Speakers engage from across the refugee sector, and MPs come from all parties to listen to their constituents. Each year the themes are related to the biggest issues in the asylum system that year as well as further afield.

She was one of the founding members of the Women's Engineering Society and was the first female member of the Federation of House Builders.  Early life and factory career  Laura Annie Buckley was born on 15 August 1877 in Halifax, Yorkshire to Charles Buckley (1836/7‚Äì1899), dyer‚Äôs labourer, and Augusta, n√©e Leaver (1838/9‚Äì1907). She started work at the age of ten as a 'half-timer' in a local textile factory. Half time in factories was introduced to spare children from working a full day; instead they worked half the day and spent the rest of the time at school, which was often built within the factory compound. When she married George Henry Willson in 1899, she was described as a worsted coating weaver. Her husband was a maker of machine tools who established a successful engineering works in Halifax, which she would help to run. The Willson's had two children, George (born in 1900) and Kathleen Vega, known as Vega, (born 1910). She became strongly involved in the trade union movement, becoming branch secretary of the Women's Labour League in Halifax in 1907. She was also a secretary of the Halifax branch of the Women's Social and Political Union which formed in January 1906. In 1907, she took part in a weavers' strike at Hebden Bridge, where she was arrested for 'inciting persons to commit a breach of the peace'. Appearing at the magistrates court, she challenged the legitimacy of the court's exclusively male constitution, demanding to be either tried by her peers or be provided with a women lawyer. She was found guilty and sentenced to fourteen days in prison. On her release, Willson reportedly said 'I went to gaol a rebel, but I have come out a regular terror'. Weeks later, she was one of 75 women arrested after a suffragette rally at Caxton Hall. She was sentenced to fourteen days in Holloway Prison. She was a joint-director of the lathe-making factory Smith Barker & Willson with her husband, which during the First World War produced munitions. The predominately female workforce were trained and supervised by Laura Annie. Noticing that some of the employees were going without food so that their children could eat, she established a works canteen to ensure that the women were properly nourished. This idea was adopted by factories across the United Kingdom. In 1917, the same year the Order of the British Empire honours were instituted, she was awarded an MBE for her contribution to 'Women's Work in Munitions'.  Engineering career  Advert for Laura Annie Willson houses in Jumples In 1919, she co-founded the Women's Engineering Society (WES) with Rachel Parsons, Margaret, Lady Moir, Lady Katharine Parsons, Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, Margaret Rowbotham and Janetta Mary Ornsby. The aim of WES was to protect the positions that women had gained in industry during World War I, and to promote equal opportunities for women in engineering. She was president of WES from 1926 to 1928. She became the first woman member of the Federation of House Builders, constructing 72 houses for workers in Halifax in 1925‚Äì26. She was a founding member of the Electrical Association for Women in 1924, alongside Caroline Haslett; this interest was reflected in her housing estates which had the latest gas and electricity appliances. In 1927, having moved to Surrey from Halifax with her husband, Willson continued her trade as a builder by purchasing land at Englefield Green.

It was founded in 2000 by the former Accor manager Dieter M√ºller in Munich and is now run by him and his wife Ursula Schelle-M√ºller.  History  In 2000, the first Motel One opened in Offenbach am Main. Hotels in Schweinfurt, Lohfelden, Ratingen and Kleinmachnow followed ‚Äì in places that are mostly close to big cities but outside the inner city. In 2004 the motel-one management changed its strategy, concentrating on opening new motels in central locations in the big cities. In the year 2015, nine small hotels were sold, for the start-up phase, to the real estate investor FDM Management, which operates them as Premi√®re-Classe- Hotels.  General information  Motel One - Berlin Spittelmarkt The first Motel One in England: The Motel One London Tower Hill in the City of London At the beginning of 2016, Motel One had 53 hotels with over 14,000 rooms, most of them in Germany, six in Salzburg and Vienna in Austria, six in the United Kingdom (3 in Scotland and one in London), and one in Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. The company currently employs over 2000 people. Although in January 2015 it was announced that Motel One would separate from nine hotels from the first generation by January 31, 2015, [3] but further advances in expansion would continue. By 2017, 74 hotels with 18,000 rooms are to be part of the company. The portfolio is increasingly shifting to other European countries. The company aims to achieve an international share of 40 percent by 2016. The operator of Motel One is One Hotels & Resorts AG, of whose majority shareholder M√ºller holds 57 percent. Investors were two sons of Dietmar Hopp and Morgan Stanley. In summer of 2015, the opening of the new Motel One at the new central station of Vienna with 533 rooms spread over 18 floors. It became the largest Motel One so far.  Layout  The interior of the hotels are designed in a modern design and consistently use the corporate identity colors brown and turquoise. Motel One offers the guest an average of 16 square meters of room, without a closet, telephone, mini-bar and room service, but therefore an individually designed lounge in each hotel. The lounge, breakfast caf√© and bar area in the One Lounge is typically regionally themed. At the Motel One on the Waidmarkt in Cologne, the theme is \\"Eau de Cologne\\". The Motel One Dresden on the Zwinger opened in April 2013 and is based on the theme \\"Zwinger\\". The Motel One in Immermannstra√üe near D√ºsseldorf's main railway station has been open since June 2013; The theme \\"Japan\\" is reflected again in the lobby. Opened on 1 December 2014, the Motel One London Tower Hill is dedicated to the theme of the British Crown Jewels,, which are kept 500 meters away from the hotel in the Tower of London. A one- concierge-tourguide is available, at cost, at the reception of the hotels in Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.  Business figures  In the 2012 financial year, an average utilization rate of 73 percent was achieved with more than 2.5 million rented rooms. Sales of the hotel companies rose by 30 percent to 175 million Euro and the EBITDA from 44 to 62 million Euro. Earnings before taxes were up 45 percent to 34 million Euro.

A quay is first recorded on the site in 1411, known as Watergate Quay. This quay fell out of use in the 18th century and in 1803 was demolished and replaced with a new structure, used for goods and passenger services. Overcrowding made it unsuitable for passenger services, resulting in most of them relocating when the Royal Pier opened in 1833. Between 1829 and 1860, the memorial column raised to William Chamberlayne (MP) was located at the quay. A horse-drawn tramway, completed on the last day of 1847, connected Southampton Terminus railway station to the quay. This tramway was directly connected to the railway in 1871. In 1876, upgrades to the tramway allowed a switch from horses to light locomotives. For many years the quay was worked by several of the diminutive LSWR C14 class locomotives, numbers 741, 743, 744 and 745, as well as an assortment of other small locomotives. During the First World War the quay was used for military traffic, mainly barges, traveling across the English Channel while the railway lines to the pier were used as sidings by the main Southampton Docks. Construction and improvements in other parts of Southampton's docks in the 1930s resulted in much of the goods traffic moving away and the quay shifted to handling mainly passenger traffic. The last major freight traffic was Scandinavian timber imported by Montague Meyer but increasing charges by British Rail in the late 1960s brought about a switch to road transport. Harbour Board Office The railway ceased being used on 4 May 1970, although the lines remained in place for a further nine years. Most of the warehouses on the quay were subsequently demolished, being replaced by offices and the Red Funnel ferry terminals. Also, a marina was constructed on the east side of the pier, inshore of the high-speed ferry pontoons. One of the last survivors of the original buildings, the Grade II listed Harbour Board offices, was, until 2015, a gentleman's club; another survivor, the former Geddes Warehouse, also listed Grade II, has been converted into a boutique hotel and restaurant. Currently the pier section is used by the Hythe Ferry and Red Funnel's Red Jet high speed service to West Cowes. The QuayConnect bus service, free to ferry passengers, connects the quay to the town centre and Southampton Central railway station. Red Funnel's vehicle ferries to East Cowes operate from the water frontage to the west of the pier.

Built in 1927‚Äì28, it is a rare example in the state of an architecturally neo-Federal building, and one of the last major constructions during the state's Colonial Revival period. Now converted to a senior care facility, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Darling Inn building occupies a prominent position on Depot Street, downtown Lyndonville's short principal thoroughfare. It is a large 3-1/2 story brick building, occupying the western half of the block between Elm and Broad Streets. It is topped by a side gable roof, with slightly projecting front-facing gable sections at each end. Gabled and segmented-arch dormers project from the roof in between the two large gables. The central facade is dominated by a broad and deep porch, extending between the end gables, which is covered by a flat roof and supported by clustered columns. Marking the entrance at the center is a gabled pediment. Most windows are 8-over-8 sash, but those above the entrance have a Palladian pattern with narrow side windows flanking a central window. Ground- floor windows at the centers of the end gable sections are larger and set in round-arch openings. with The site where the Darling Inn stands has probably held a hotel since not long after the founding of Lyndonville in 1866. The Lyndon Hotel burned down in 1924, and a building committee of local businessmen was formed to develop a replacement. The land was owned by Elmore Darling, a local businessman and philanthropist who had retired from the hotel trade in New York City to his extensive estate north of the town. The principal design was by Wells and Hudson of Hanover, New Hampshire, but Darling personally designed the building's elaborately decorated dining room. At its opening in 1928, the hotel was described as Vermont's most opulent. The Darling Inn was converted into nursing home in 1964, and has since been converted into apartments.

In 1894, he partnered with the official Zhang Zhidong to found a state-sponsored silk filature in Wuchang, which allowed him to obtain official titles. Most westerners in the Shanghai International Settlement knew him as Chang-kee which was actually the initial name of his business. His name was also spelled as Wang Tso-ch'ing. Early life Huang Zuoqing was from a well-to-do family in Linghu Town (Ëè±Êπñ), Gui'an County (Ê≠∏ÂÆâ), Huzhou, Zhejiang, Qing Empire, and received a good early education. Like many adolescents in Huzhou (known in China as the \\"City of Silk\\"), he worked as an apprentice in a silk shop as a teenager. In the late 1850s, he moved to Shanghai with his family when Taiping rebels attacked Zhejiang. In Shanghai Huang Zuoqing found a job in a silk store, and showing diligence and competence, he was well trusted by the store owner. He also learned English in his spare time. This skill enabled him to act as a trade agent between Chinese manufacturers of hand-reeled silk and western exporters. Because western demand for silk from China was increasingly high (due to an 1850s silkworm disease epidemic in Europe, coupled with the rise of American and French silk-weaving industries at the time), Huang earned a sizable income from the commissions. Establishing the Chang-kee Filature In the early 1870s, Huang opened Hsiang-kee (Á••Ë®ò), his own silk store on Shanghai's Jiangxi Road (Ê±üË•øË∑Ø). In addition to hand-reeled silk, Huang also purchased raw silk and cocoons for his foreign partners. At that point, it became increasingly obvious that traditional hand-reeled silk could not compete with machine-run, steam-reeled silk in quality and consistency demanded by the global market, not to mention efficiency. In 1861, British merchants had established the Ewo Filature (ÊÄ°ÂíåÁµ≤Âª†) in Shanghai, the first steam filature in China. It significantly rocked the Chinese silk industry, so much that it had to close in 1869 due to the guild of Chinese silk merchants preventing it from acquiring a reliable supply of cocoons. In 1878, Kee Chong Filature (ÊóóÊòåÁπÖÁµ≤Âª†) was established in Shanghai by the Americans, which became so successful that it expanded to as many as 1000 reels. Partnership with Zhang Zhidong In 1894, the Viceroy of Huguang and well-known reformer Zhang Zhidong planned to establish the Hubei (Hupeh) Silk Filature (ÊπñÂåóÁπÖÁµ≤Âª†) in Wuchang, as part of the country's Self-Strengthening Movement. He already knew about Huang Zuoqing‚Äîwho owned a silk shop in Hankou just across the Yangtze from Wuchang‚Äîand he asked Zhao Shuqiao (Ë∂ôËàíÁøπ), Governor of Jiangsu (which administered Shanghai), to invite Huang Zuoqing to Wuchang to run his business venture. Huang Zuoqing agreed to invest 20,000 taels of silver and recommended his third son Huang Jinquan (ÈªÉÊôâËçÉ) to serve as the manager. Zhang Zhidong was ecstatic, and through his recommendation Huang Zuoqing received a title equivalent to an official of the second-rank from the imperial court. However, Zhang Zhidong wanted a \\"government-supervised and merchant-managed\\" enterprise; Huang refused. After trying and failing to find other merchant partners, Zhang Zhidong again turned to Huang Zuoqing, this time agreeing to a joint state-private partnership. Huang Zuoqing invested 470,000 taels of silver, and the Hubei Silk Filature was established. But Huang Jinquan discovered that the purchased machines were inferior and even defective, because someone cooked the books. The problem was not resolved until several rounds of negotiations, and the filature did not start running until May 1896, with 208 reels and 300 laborers. Though the Filature had some success, because of too many government restrictions the Huangs could not agree with the state on several aspects. In May 1897, Huang Jinquan completely withdrew from the Hubei Filature and returned to Shanghai. Bankruptcy and death Around this time, Huang Zuoqing's Yu Jin Spinning Mill (Ë£ïÊôâÁ¥óÂª†) in Yangpu District, Shanghai, with 1,500 laborers and 15,000 spindles, was also under financial distress, as it could not compete with the state-run monopolies under bureaucrats Li Hongzhang and Sheng Xuanhuai. Huang Zuoqing had no choice but look for foreign investment, and this eventually led to bankruptcy. The factory, under the new name Xing Tai Spinning Mill (ËààÊ≥∞Á¥óÂª†), was purchased by the Japanese Mitsui & Co. in 1902. Huang Zuoqing died in July 1902, on the way back to Shanghai after a business trip to Suzhou where he contracted cholera.

Biography Edith was born in January 1872 in Ecclesfield, Bradford. Her mother was Grace Procter, a mill worker. Her father was most likely Joseph Fawcett, a local mill owner, who signed an 'Agreement to a Child' to pay Grace a weekly allowance until Edith was thirteen years old. Raised by her aunts, Edith moved to Huddersfield some time before her 10th birthday. She worked in a mill from age 10 and left school at age 13. Edith married Frederick Key, a blind musician, in March 1891. Together they opened a music shop in Huddersfield, which they lived above. Frederick was active in socialist politics, and Edith soon became involved in the women's suffrage movement. She was the secretary-organiser of the Huddersfield branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), formed in 1906 at a meeting chaired by Emmeline Pankhurst. Edith's diligent record-keeping ensured a complete record survives of this period of local suffragist history in the form of her minutes book, deposited in the West Yorkshire Archives Service by Edith's granddaughter. It is one of only three WSPU minute books known to have survived, and the only one outside of a London branch, and provides a valuable insight into how local branches interacted with the WSPU, and of the concerns of WSPU members far removed from the militant actions which mostly took place in London. She attended several suffrage demonstrations in London, at one being arrested and held in HM Prison Holloway for several days before being released due to lack of evidence. The WSPU minute book includes a copy of a letter sent by Edith on behalf of the branch to \\"dear friends\\" in Holloway Gaol, expressing hope from the branch \\"that your health and strength and womanly endurance may enable you to complete your sentences\\". The Key's home above their music shop served as regional headquarters for the Huddersfield WSPU. According to Edith's son Archibald, it also became \\"unofficial headquarters for the ILP [the Independent Labour Party, of which Frederick was a member] and plotting room for suffragette militancy\\". From 1913‚Äì14, Edith used her home to hide a number of suffragette \\"mice\\", women who were evading prison under the Cat and Mouse Act. Among those she offered shelter to was Adela Pankhurst, daughter of Emmeline Pankhurst. Edith died in 1937 aged 65, and was buried in Edgerton Cemetery. Legacy Key's name is commemorated in Huddersfield through two organisations: the Edith Key Centre, a base for community and campaigning organisations, opened in 2014; and the Edith Key building at the University of Huddersfield, which houses the Department of Psychology in the School of Human and Health Sciences.

Built in 1887, it was an excellent example of Victorian railroad architecture, serving as a gateway for the town's industrial products to markets nationwide. Converted to commercial use after rail service was discontinued on the line, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It has since been demolished; a modern building stands where it used to. Description and history The Johnson Railroad Depot stood on the south side of Railroad Street south of the village of Johnson, opposite its junction with Creamery Road. It was a long rectangular two-story structure, oriented parallel to the right of way of railroad tracks built by the Saint Johnsbury and Lamoille County Railroad, now occupied by the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. The depot had a long single-story gable-roofed section, and a shorter two-story section, which housed the stationmaster's quarters on the second floor. Common features of these sections include large Stick style brackets on extended eaves, and projecting cornices above the doors and windows. A square telegrapher's bay projected from the two-story section on the track side. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 1980, it was still in use as a freight depot, and retained most of its original interior fixtures. with The St. Johnsbury and Lamoille introduced service to Johnson in 1872, the year its first station was built. This depot was built in 1887 as a replacement for that one. The station was an important part of the local economy, because most of the area's industrial products and goods were shipped to market via the railroad. The depot has apparently been demolished; a modern single-story building now stands at its location.

Her creative work was mainly focused on embroidery using fabrics, although she also used the technique of collage with waste materials. Early life and education (1936‚Äì1962) After leaving her birthplace of Santiago, Cuba, she spent some time in New York with her two children, Yasfaro and Domingo, to work as a model, where she met Montenegrin artist Dado (n√© Miodrag ƒêuriƒá), three years her senior, and a prot√©g√© of French artist Jean Dubuffet. Carmen and Dado fell in love and married. The couple returned together to France and set up home in a converted mill in a small village outside of Paris. and settled with him in rural Normandy in 1962. Together they raised five children. She did not attend any art school and developed her own creative technique as early as 1956 with materials that were both affordable and easily available. Fabrics and textile cuts were materials she used from the beginning. 371x371px Active years in France (from 1962) Embroidery constituted the major part of Hessie's practice, but her work ‚Äì which has attracted renewed attention in recent years ‚Äì embraces a broader scope than is at first apparent. Cuba-born but based in France since 1962, Hessie developed her signature practice from the 1970s on: seductive, rigorous compositions of abstract and geometric motifs in white or coloured cotton thread on unbleached cotton canvas. More infrequently, her works feature stitched-on buttons, holes, or typewritten letters dispersed across the fabric support, together with collages of objects or materials on paper. Her repetitive techniques are the basis for a strict formal repertory, expressed in series of works with functional, descriptive titles: Grillages (grid forms), B√¢tons p√©dagogiques (teaching sticks), V√©g√©tation or Machines √† √©crire (typewriters). 300x300px Hessie died in Pontoise, France on 9 October 2017 at the age of 81.

The tax system is relatively simple, based on a flat- rate taxation of labor income and certain capital income. Income taxation All citizens of Greenland are subject to personal taxation on the basis of full or limited tax liability. The government tax rate is up to 44%, depending on the municipality of taxation. There are some tax deductions in Greenland. Fully tax liable individuals and individuals with limited tax liability from employment and employment related income are entitled to an allowance of DKK 48,000 a year (2016 amount). Persons with full tax liability to Greenland are further entitled to an extra allowance of DKK 10,000 a year (2016 amount). A deduction for foreign workers also exists, and this deduction can be as high as 35%. Deductions are also available to students and parents. Fully tax liable individuals and individuals with limited tax liability from employment and employment related income are entitled to an allowance of DKK 48,000 a year (2016 amount). Persons with full tax liability to Greenland are further entitled to an extra allowance of DKK 10,000 a year (2016 amount). The amounts can be subject to adjustment every year, but have been stable for a number of years. VAT and business taxes Greenland is one of the very few countries in the world that do not charge VAT tax. This means that citizens of Greenland and who purchase goods outside Greenland - and taking or sending goods to Greenland - have the opportunity to get VAT refunded. It's called VAT-refund. Tax administration Citizens subject to taxation use the calendar year as the income tax/fiscal year. Permission can be granted to use a 12-month period other than the calendar year, provided that the period starts on the first day of a calendar month. Generally, the income period for companies follows the accounting year, which has to be no longer than 12 months. However, the first accounting year can vary from 6 to 18 months.

The story has been adopted by Andrew Lang in the Violet Fairy Book.  Summary  The tale is about Jacob, the son of a cobbler, who lives in a small German town. When he was twelve years old, he is said to have had a beautiful face and figure. His mother, Hanne, sells vegetables and fruit at the market and Jacob helps her by carrying home the bags for the customers. One day, an ugly old woman, who has a long, crooked nose and a thin neck, comes to his mother's stand to buy some herbs. It is later revealed that she is the fairy Wise-herb. She throws everything in into disarray and makes a mess of the herbs on display so that nobody wants to buy them anymore. In reaction to this, Jacob insults her and makes fun of her looks. In response, she wishes him a long nose as well, and no neck. In the end, she does buy a few cabbages and lets Jacob carry them home for her. Arriving at the house of the woman, the cabbages turn into human heads. Guinea pigs and squirrels, which behave like humans and serve the old woman, are living here. She offers Jacob some soup while she is talking about a herb that he will never find. After he eats the soup, Jacob feels like he is falling asleep and is dreaming about living and working as a squirrel in the woman's house. He stays for seven years and learns, among other things, how to cook. By doing that he discovers a herb, smells it and wakes up. However, when he returns to his family, nobody recognizes him and everyone, including his own mother and father, call him a hideous dwarf and chase him away. He has turned into an actual dwarf with a long nose, no neck, a hump and brown hands. After this rejection, Jacob decides to try his luck as a cook and visits the duke (Herzog) of ‚ÄúFrankistan‚Äù, who is known as a gourmet (the backstory plays in the Orient, where a German tells this fairy tale from his homeland, the country of the Franks). There he manages to convince the chef of his talent and the duke, who loves his cooking as well, employs him as the sous chef and gives him the name Dwarf Nose. Jacob is now highly respected. After two years, Jacob buys three geese at the market and one of them talks to him. The goose tells him that her name is Mimi and that she was the daughter of the wizard Weatherbuck from the island of Gotland. She, too, had been cursed by a wicked sorceress, she explained. To be sure, she continued, she knew a lot about magic herbs and tells Jacob that he has to find the herb which transformed him in order to be liberated. Because the duke is being visited by another nobleman, Jacob is supposed to prepare an extravagant meal for them. The nobleman enjoys his meal but then orders the queen of all p√¢t√©s , a Souzeraine, which Jacob does not know how to make but fortunately Mimi does. With her help he bakes the p√¢t√©, but the earl thinks it lacks the herb \\"sneeze-with-pleasure\\". Jacob has to go and find it to bake another one, otherwise he will be beheaded. Mimi once again helps him out by looking for the herb with him. Once he finds and smells it, he transforms back into his old self. In order to show his gratitude, he takes Mimi back to her father who lifts her curse as well. Everything turns out well for Mimi and him, but the duke and his guest declare war (herbal war) on each other because of Jacob's curse, which can only be ended by a perfectly baked p√¢t√© (p√¢t√© peace).  Interpretation  In his works, Wilhelm Hauff often comments on the political situation of his time. In the pre-March era, Germany was torn into several different small countries, which were governed by their arbitrary king, duke or earl. Hauff dreamt of witnessing these injustices being persecuted. He also believed that a righteous and strong king could provide the people with fortune and wealth. In Dwarf Nose his criticism also becomes obvious through the names of the dishes, which the bewitched boy has to prepare for his nobleman: the Danish soup, red hamburger dumplings and ‚Äì upon a special request of the earl ‚Äì ‚Äúthe queen of all dishes, the p√¢t√© Souzeraine‚Äù, a clear allusion to the political expression suzerainty. It is consequently no accident, that Hauff ends his story with a ‚Äúp√¢t√© peace‚Äù. The art of cooking becomes Jacob‚Äôs purpose in life, which thereby compensates for the rejection from his family. It is typical for a family tale by Hauff that Jacob marries no utopian princess, but Mimi, an ordinary woman (daughter of the wizard).

At high school he started reading books of philosophy, aesthetics and music: his favourites were Kant, Croce, Schopenauer, Beethoven and Wagner; he also read books of architecture and liked the gothic style. Gino Patti fin√¨shed his long studies by graduating in Jurisprudence at the university of Palermo, then he felt free to do what he wished, so he started reading a lot about painting and began to paint.http://www.trapaninostra.it/libri/Provincia_Regionale_Trapani_PROMO/1957_Rassegna_mensile_della_Provincia/Trapani_Rassegna_mensile_della_Provincia_anno_IV-05.pdf He made an exhibition in Alcamo, more to please his friends, and all his paintings were sold; he took part in the first Provincial Exhibition of Figurative Arts of Trapani (look at the article written by professor Gianni Di Stefano on the magazine Trapani-anno I, n.4 of 15 August 1956) and in the prize Alcide de Gasperi in 1956.

Early life  Born to Katsujir≈ç Matsukawa as the eldest daughter in Aizu (Aizuwakamatsu post 1868), named according to the year on Chinese calendar when she was born. At the age of one in 1868, her father left his family as an espionage who served for Aizu clan against the revolutionist during Boshin war, and the next year, he was relocated to Tonami, the present day Mutsu with his feudal lord. Kashi, her mother and the newborn sister Miya endured poverty and adverse circumstances during that period in Aizu, while Kashi's mother died in 1870.  In Yokohama  ≈åkawa Jinbei, a wealthy merchant from Yokohama was visiting Aizu Wakamatsu and adopted Kashi as his daughter. In 1871 at the age of seven, ≈åkawa Kashi was admitted to and studied at Isaac Ferris Seminary led by Mary E. Kidder-Miller, a missionary of Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) who founded the Seminary in 1875. It was in 1877 when Kashi was baptised at the Church of Christ in Japan by pastor Inagaki Makoto. Kashi graduated from Isaac Ferris Seminary among the first alumnae in 1881 at the age of seventeen and was hired as a teacher for Japanese literature at her alma mater, which was by then called . She used a tentative family name Shimada instead of ≈åkawa, a name thought to be after her natural father's espionage name. Her stepfather died in 1883, and in 1885 her natural father Matsukawa Katsujir≈ç restored Kashi to his family register in Tokyo where he lived. She had been suffering from tuberculosis.

Kashi had taken her pen name from her home town Wakamatsu, and Shizu or Shizuko meaning \\"the servant of God\\". Aside from Shizu and Shizuko, she used such names as B≈çjo (literary Joan Doe) and Shizunojo at times. For her first name , she chose alternative combination of Chinese characters to match with her married name as . She retired from Ferris and married Iwamoto Yoshiharu in 1889 at the church she was baptised in Yokohama. Yoshiharu was the editor in chief at Jogaku zasshi since 1886, as the co-founder and his friend Kond≈ç Kumaz≈ç had passed away that year. Kashi started teaching English at Meiji Girls' School which had been founded in 1885, but Kimura T≈çko, the first principal had died in 1886 to whom Kashi dedicated a poetry in English. The second principal pastor Kimura Kumaji was T≈çko's husband, and as a good friend of Kimuras', Yoshiharu supported the administrative works at the school. Kumaji retired in 1892 and Yoshiharu succeeded as the third principal until he closed it in 1909. Kashi and Yoshiharu had two daughters and a son.  Novels and essays  There are over 50 literature she published on Jogaku zasshi with the most popular translation of Little Lord Fauntleroy written by an American novelist Frances Hodgson Burnett.

Daemi was arrested on 21 October 2014 and sentenced as of 21 May 2015 to a fourteen- year prison sentence. Peaceful activities for which she was charged include distributing anti-death penalty leaflets and making posts on Facebook and Twitter criticising Iran's execution record. Later, Daemi and her sisters were arrested and sentenced on charges of having \\"insulted officers on duty\\". Subsequent appeals have overturned that conviction and reduced Daemi's original sentence. Daemi has been on hunger strike at Evin Prison (9 April 2017 ‚Äì 1 June 2017, 55 days) and at Shahr-e Rey prison near Tehran (24 January 2018 ‚Äì 15 February 2018, 22 days). She continues to protest against conditions and against the death penalty from within Evin prison. She is considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.  Activities Daemi worked at the prestigious Revolution Sports Club in Tehran. She participated in protests appealing for an end to capital punishment, and attended rallies on behalf of children in Syria.  Arrest  Atena Daemi was arrested on 21 October 2014; she was kept in solitary confinement, denied access to a lawyer, and repeatedly interrogated for 86 days. On 14 January 2015 she was transferred to the women's wing of Evin prison. She was accused of ‚Äúgathering and colluding against national security‚Äù, ‚Äúspreading propaganda against the system‚Äù, ‚Äúconcealing evidence‚Äù and ‚Äúinsulting the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Supreme Leader‚Äù.  Sentence  Daemi was sentenced on 21 May 2015 by Judge Moghiseh of Revolutionary Court Branch 28, after a fifteen-minute trial. She received a sentence totaling fourteen years in prison, on several counts. The longest sentence was seven years for ‚Äúassembly and collusion‚Äù. Her sentence relates to peaceful activism, including charges related to distributing anti-death penalty leaflets and posts on Facebook and Twitter criticising Iran's execution record. Her arrest and sentencing are seen as part of a wave of vague charges and harsh sentences being used against activists, authors, and artists by Iran's judiciary. Daemi's case was appealed to Branch 36 of the Appeals Court. As of 13 January 2016 the appeal had not been processed and concerns about her health had not been addressed. Daemi was released on bail, after a payment of 5500 million rials, on 15 February 2016. An appeals court hearing was held in July 2016. The appeal was based on Article 134 of the New Islamic Penal Code, under which her sentence was reduced to the maximum length of the most serious charge, seven years. Daemi was re-arrested at her parents home, in front of her sisters, on 26 November 2016 and returned to Evin Prison. She formally complained to the Office of the Prosecutor in Evin prison about the actions of the Revolutionary Guards who arrested her. On 23 March 2017, Daemi and her sisters were charged and convicted with ‚Äúinsulting public officers on duty‚Äù. After a one-hour criminal court trial, they were sentenced to three months and one day. This term of imprisonment was added to Daemi's sentence, but suspended for her sisters. In April 2017, Daemi began a hunger strike to protest the additional charges. At a second appeals court hearing, she and her sisters were acquitted of the 2017 charges. Daemi ended her hunger strike on 1 June 2017, after 55 days.  Hunger strikes  =Evin Prison = Daemi started a hunger strike on 9 April 2017, which lasted until 1 June, a strike of 55 days, to protest the addition of three months and one day to her seven-year sentence. It was also in protest of the sentencing of her sisters after the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) complained that the sisters had ‚Äúinsulted officers on duty.‚Äù A letter was written by Amnesty International on 17 May 2017, asking for Daemi to be transferred from prison to a hospital, and describing what had happened to her in prison. The letter said that Daemi, who had then been on hunger strike for 40 days, had been coughing up blood, and had suffered severe weight loss, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure fluctuations, and kidney pain. Doctors warned that she required immediate hospitalization. However, the authorities at Evin Prison refused to authorize her transfer to a hospital outside prison for medical treatment. Her hunger strike ended on 1 June 2017, after an appeals court struck down the additional charges against her and her sisters. = Shahr-e Rey prison = On 24 January 2018, Daemi was transferred to Shahr-e Rey prison in Varamin outside Tehran. It is also known as Gharchak or Qarchak prison. She was moved along with Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, who had been imprisoned for writing an unpublished fictional story that criticized the practice of stoning women to death. Their transfer to Shahr-e Rey, a prison for violent offenders, was challenged as illegal, because it violates Iranian regulations about the classification of prisoners. Both women began a hunger strike on 3 February 2018 following their transfer. Amnesty international again appealed for their immediate and unconditional release on the grounds that they have been imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of their human rights. Amnesty has repeatedly expressed concern over unsanitary and dangerous conditions at the prison, which was previously an industrial chicken farm, as well as concerns about ill-treatment of Daemi and Iraee. Atena Daemi remained on hunger strike until 15 February 2018, 22 days. Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee continued her hunger strike until 24 April 2018, lasting 81 days. Both women were in extremely serious physical condition, and were the subject of international appeals. They were returned to Evin Prison's Women's on May 10, 2018. Denied treatment She has long been suffering from persistent dizziness and numbness in the right eye area. The medical physician in Qarchak Prison had requested an MRI for her but she has not been transferred to the hospital. Subsequent protests On 25 May 2018, Daemi sent a letter out of Evin Prison, condemning the death penalty and discussing the situation of death-row political prisoner Ramin Hossein-Panahi. On 10 October 2018, World Day Against the Death Penalty, Daemi, Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, and Maryam Akbari Monfared signed a letter publicly appealing to Javaid Rehman, as a United Nations Special Rapporteur, to assess possible human rights violations in Iran, including the use of the death penalty. In October 2018, commemorating the fourth year of her imprisonment, Daemi wrote a public letter to her mother.

Incorporated on September 13, 1954, it is one of the most powerful private groups in the city, and is highly influential in Congress. It was the primary backer of a wide range of important projects, including the near-complete razing of Southwest D.C. in favor of redevelopment in the 1950s and 1960s, the construction of the Washington Metro subway system, the construction of the city's first and second convention centers, the construction of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and the construction of the Verizon Center. It has also been successful in pushing for changes in the District of Columbia Public Schools, reform of the federal role in the District of Columbia's finances, and reform of the District's tax structure. The association, whose members are largely drawn from the business community, prefers to work behind the scenes and avoid media attention. It is highly influential, although assessments of its influence in the past decade have varied. The organization has also created a number of independent nonprofits and subsidiary bodies, which have worked on range of issues, from waterway restoration to crime. History =Founding and early issues= The Federal City Council was incorporated on September 13, 1954, \\"to develop, stimulate and encourage civic leadership in community development in the National Capitol\\". Phil Graham, co-owner and publisher of The Washington Post, was the major force in creating the council. Graham was deeply concerned about the decline of the District of Columbia in the post-World War II period and the city's rapid loss of population and business to suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. Graham was also worried that the Southwest Washington urban renewal project, authorized in 1946 and funded in 1949, would be cancelled, ending the city's best chance at turning itself around. In 1952, Graham held a meeting of like-minded top businessmen in the boardroom of Riggs Bank to discuss formation of an organization to counteract these trends. These discussions led to formation of the Federal City Council in 1954. Membership was largely limited to businesspeople, because the group felt that only private sector money and a business-like approach to development and management could improve the District. Among the original members of the group in 1954 were Graham and Francis Addison, Jr., president of Security Bank and former president of the Washington Board of Trade. George A. Garrett, a former ambassador, was elected the organization's first president on November 16. A fundamental concept which the group agreed upon early in its history was to work behind the scenes and only on projects that can shape the city for 20 years or more. The Federal City Council was active in a wide range of issues in the 1950s, including slum clearance,; and is credited with successfully lobbying the Eisenhower administration to expedite the razing of much of Southwest Washington It was also involved in an attempt to locate the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in the District of Columbia,; urban planning,; demolition of the temporary Main Navy and Munitions Buildings on the National Mall, the site of the proposed D.C. Cultural Center, and the size of the federal payment made to the city in lieu of property taxes. It was particularly active on the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge issue. It pushed hard for a bridge rather than a tunnel, and, once a bridge had been chosen, for the bridge's location to be about upstream from the final location.; ; =1960s: Pushing big economic projects= Wholesale demolition of the slums in Southwest D.C. (depicted) was a key goal of the Federal City Council. Urban planning and the federal contribution to the city's budget continued to occupy some of the Federal City Council's agenda in the early 1960s.; ; ; But big economic development projects moved to center stage for the organization. It unsuccessfully pushed for a \\"Federal City Center\\" (a vast complex of government office buildings akin to Federal Triangle) in 1960. The organization also pushed hard for construction of the D.C. Cultural Center, even though it lost the battle to erect the auditorium at L'Enfant Plaza.; It was far more successful in opposing cancellation of the Southwest Washington urban renewal project, which called for razing nearly all buildings in that quadrant of the city and constructing a new urban center. Although the Federal City Council's specific plans were not adopted, it was deeply involved in the planning process and its studies often relied on by Congress.; ; ; ; ; ; ; The Federal City Council even raised money to develop its own concepts for redeveloping downtown and Southwest D.C., and lobbied Congress to have its plans adopted. In 1962, it won adoption of its proposal in the House of Representatives. When the bill died in the Senate at the end of the 87th Congress, it went to the Senate and won passage there in 1963. When the 1963 legislation moved to the House, Representatives John Dowdy and John L. McMillan attached a number of riders to the bill that required competitive bidding, forced federal agencies to give displaced businesses priority in receiving federal assistance, required the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop plans for relocating low-income residents, and placed limits on the number of redevelopment projects that could be approved or constructed at any given time. But many liberals in Congress as well as HUD Secretary Robert C. Weaver opposed these riders. The riders were enacted into law. Unwilling to see redevelopment of Southwest D.C. collapse, the Federal City Council agreed to sponsor legislation that would authorize the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA, the federal bureau overseeing the reconstruction of Southwest D.C.) to conduct redevelopment on the same basis as federal agencies in other cities. Although this meant ignoring the Federal City Council's plans for redevelopment, it allowed the RLA to begin acting quickly and decisively on redevelopment projects. Two of the major projects the Federal City Council pushed for in the 1960s were Inner Loop highway system and its associated Three Sisters Bridge, and the Washington Metro subway system. The Inner Loop was strongly opposed by local citizens, who felt it was unnecessary, destroyed many neighborhoods, and despoiled the environment. However, Representative William Natcher, chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Appropriations, was not only a strong advocate of bridge and highway construction but also convinced that construction of the Inner Loop was essential to the growth of the District of Columbia. The Federal City Council, too, advocated the Inner Loop as a response to the flight of retail and light industry for the suburbs (a trend which began in the 1950s). The organization believed that quick and easy automobile access to the city (with lots of inexpensive parking) would draw shoppers and retailers back. A large subway system was equally important, as the Federal City Council concluded that surface transit alone could not meet the needs of the rapidly growing D.C. metropolitan area. The organization pushed hard for construction of Metro even though Representative Natcher threatened to cancel the subway project if the Inner Loop was not constructed.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; The organization also wished to ensure that wealthier suburbanites would be able to reach the downtown D.C. shopping district, in the hopes this would reverse or at least stop the flight of retail out of the city. As part of its Inner Loop push, the Federal City Council asked the City Commission to \\"nationalize\\" all parking the city. This was a major step, for it meant government ownership of all parking lots, parking garages, and valet parking lots in the city. The Washington Parking Association, a trade association of parking lot owners, strongly opposed the move. Although the City Commission was willing to pass nationalization legislation, there was extensive opposition in Congress (which had the power to overturn any city law), and the measure died.; ; ; Other, smaller projects with the Federal City Council worked on during the 1960s included another attempt to get rid of the \\"tempos\\" on the National Mall, construction of a \\"national aquarium\\" in East Potomac Park, and a major boost in police to create a \\"war on crime\\". The agenda of the Federal City Council could also work against democracy in the District of Columbia. During the 1960s, there was an increasingly strong push for District of Columbia home rule. Because it supported the vested interests of the status quo, the Federal City Council strongly opposed home rule. It opposed initiatives supported by home rule activists, and often proposed and pushed for the adoption of plans that home rule advocates opposed. In order to win support for its proposals, the Federal City Council raised money to re-elect members of the powerful House Committee on the District of Columbia‚Äîmost of whom also opposed home rule, as it significantly reduced their power in Congress. =1970s: Focus on economic development= The Federal City Council successfully pushed for construction of D.C.'s first convention center. Although portions of the Inner Loop were constructed, the majority of highways that comprised the system (including the elements most destructive of neighborhoods and the environment) were cancelled by federal court decisions and by changes in national transportation policy during the late 1960s and the early 1970s. The Three Sisters Bridge project was killed in the House of Representatives in early December 1971. With the Inner Loop dead, the Federal City Council continued to push for city-owned parking and for full funding of the Metro system.; With federal funds for massive infrastructure development dwindling fast in the early 1970s, the Federal City Council turned its focus to smaller projects that would spur economic development. One of its key issues was the construction of a Dwight D. Eisenhower Convention Center to make the city attractive to large trade association conventions. The push for a convention center began in 1973. Although there was extensive opposition in Congress at first, the Federal City Council lobbied hard for federal approval. This was finally given in 1978.; ; The Washington Convention Center finally opened in December 1982. The Federal City Council also backed a \\"D.C. Building Corporation\\" to assist developers in obtaining financing for major projects,; ; and pushed the city to create an economic development strategic plan. As part of its economic redevelopment initiative, the Federal City Council also sought to repeal rent control laws in the District of Columbia. Rent control, the organization argued, discouraged new housing from being built in the city and retarded the city's economic growth. The city's rent control law, enacted in 1975, was seen as vulnerable by the Federal City Council in 1975 and 1976, as few residents had seen its benefits and did not yet support it.; ; Its repeal attempt was unsuccessful, however. The Federal City Council also began unsuccessfully pushing in the late 1970s for a regional economic planning board similar to the urban planning body it had pressed for in the 1950s.; =1980s: The trade center, crime, and schools= In the 1980s, the Federal City Council backed two plans‚Äîone to reduce flights at Washington National Airport and another to redevelop Buzzard Point‚Äîat the opening and close of the decade.; Neither plan was implemented. It also released a study in 1980 criticizing the District government for allowing significant deterioration in the city's of water pipes. (The city took no action until a series of major pipeline breaks led to emergency action in 1993.) The Federal City Council initiated the effort to build the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, which completed the Federal Triangle complex. The concept for a massive \\"trade center\\", which would become an international headquarters for corporations and trade associations, was a more successful project. In June 1983, the Federal City Council proposed that a huge $300 million structure be built on unused land adjacent to Maine Avenue SW. Despite local citizen opposition, the organization convinced D.C. Mayor Marion Barry to begin pushing the plan through the D.C. City Council and Congress. Opposition from executive branch agencies, however, derailed the plan, and by 1986 the Federal City Council was looking for an alternative site for the building. In late 1986, the association began pushing for construction of the trade center on a parking lot in Federal Triangle, an area originally intended for a major government office building in the 1930s but never built due to the financial distress caused by the Great Depression. This site won near-universal approval, and in 1987 Congress authorized construction of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.; ; ; ; ; ; ; Donald A. Brown, who chaired the Federal City Council's International Center Task Force, was one of five people nominated to the U.S. International Cultural and Trade Center Commission, which served as a board of supervisors overseeing the construction of the building. Terence Golden, who was director of the federal government's General Services Administration (GSA) and who helped shepherd the legislation authorizing the building through Congress, later was elected chairman of the board of directors of the Federal City Council. Originally intended to cost $363 million, the $818 million Ronald Reagan Building opened on May 5, 1998, after years of funding and construction delays. The construction of the Washington Metro and development of the federal government became major issues for the Federal City Council in the mid-1980s. The group received approximately $250,000 in August 1985 to study the transit needs of the area through the year 2000, the first time a group independent of Metro was authorized by the federal government to conduct such a study. The organization's study, released in March 1986, said Metro faced a financial crisis by 2000 caused by significant cuts in federal funds as well as rapidly growing capital improvement needs (such as replacing subway cars and worn equipment and track). In December 1986, the Federal City Council issued a report that recommended that the federal government undertake a 10-year plan to construct new federal office buildings rather than lease space for federal agencies. The proposal seemed to die, but in 1990 the GSA incorporated its key recommendations into a new office space consolidation policy. GSA even proposed building a new United States Department of Transportation headquarters using air rights above the railroad tracks north of Union Station. The financing model for the structure had \\"the fingerprints of the Federal City Council all over it.\\" The Federal City Council actively pushed for redevelopment of the northwest bank of the Anacostia River as a means of creating room for more federally owned office buildings as well as redeveloping the District of Columbia. The General Services Administration initially tried to lure the Securities and Exchange Commission to Buzzard Point by offering to construct it a new office building there in 1978, but this effort failed. By 1988, however, the Federal City Council was part heavily involved with the city government, the federal government, and private landowners to plan a redevelopment of the warehouse area into apartment and office buildings, parks, and retail space. In the late 1980s, the Federal City Council turned its attention to crime rather than development. By this time, Washington, D.C., was suffering from an epidemic of crack cocaine use. The drug made an appearance in the United States in 1981, and by the end of 1986 was deeply entrenched in the District of Columbia. The following year, one study estimated that there were 24,000 drug dealers in the city (38.6 per 1,000 residents), with at least 14,000 of them dealing on a regular basis (at least one day per week). By one estimate, cocaine and crack cocaine use doubled in the city between 1986 and 1987. A private study estimated that one in six African American men in the city were arrested for selling illegal drugs before the age of 21, and by 1990 a shocking one in four African American men in the city had sold drugs before the age of 30. By 1990, the District of Columbia had the nation's highest rate of drug addiction (32.9 per 1,000 residents). The crack cocaine epidemic drove the city's murder rate in 1988 to 372, and 80 percent of the city's murders were drug-related. With drug-related crime outstripping by far economic development as the city's largest problem, in 1986 the Federal City Council joined with the Community Foundation, the Greater Washington Board of Trade, and the Greater Washington Research Center to form the Washington Fund for the Prevention of Substance Abuse. By October 1988, the Federal City Council also sponsored the creation of the Corporation Against Drug Abuse (CADA), an employer-funded entity to encourage the adoption of stricter drug testing and drug abuse policies in the workplace and to work against drug abuse generally in the community. As part of its interest in social programs, the Federal City Council also turned its attention for the first time to the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). DCPS Superintendent Andrew E. Jenkins awarded the organization a $500,000 grant to assemble a team of 51 community leaders and review DCPS curricula, budget, extra-curricular programs, and educational goals and priorities. The grant was one of the largest ever made by the school system. The report, due in June 1989, was expected to guide the DCPS system through the 1990s. To build support for implementing the report's findings, the council created the D.C. Committee on Public Education (a group of parents and business, religious, and civic leaders), in 1988. When released on June 20, 1989, the report recommended spending $355 million over the next five years to extend the school day by five hours (to a 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. schedule); extend the school year by 40 days; construct new schools; repair existing schools; and add stronger math and science programs and multicultural education to the curriculum. To pay for the plan, the Federal City Council's team suggested cutting administrative costs by $8.5 million, eliminating 400 central staff positions, closing some schools, and selling some school property. The Committee on Public Education remained active for many years, issuing reports critical of the public school system. In 1989, the Federal City Council issued a report castigating the government of the District of Columbia for allowing the city's roads to deteriorate. The report noted that the city spent just $5 million a year on road repair, which it used almost exclusively for temporary patches rather than permanent repair, upgrades, and maintenance. The report identified a $1.6 billion backlog in street maintenance projects. The backlogs led the city to separate its road maintenance, repair, and construction functions from the District of Columbia Department of Public Works, creating a new District Department of Transportation in 2002. =1990s: The new convention center and new sports arena= The Verizon Center (formerly the MCI Center) was built after the Federal City Council completed negotiations with sports team owner Abe Pollin. The new Walter E. Washington Convention Center was pushed by the Federal City Council as a replacement for the city's first convention center. The Federal City Council helped win financing for a new Washington Convention Center. The existing convention center opened on December 10, 1982. But just eight years later, the facility's small size and a nationwide boom in the construction of large convention centers had caused the facility to see a dramatic drop in business. The Federal City Council pushed hard for the construction of a new, much larger convention center, and helped the city fashion ways to finance it. When the project encountered resistance from the business community and Congress, the Federal City Council mobilized its membership to come out publicly in support of the arena. In May 1990, the city unveiled plans for a new $685 million, convention center backed by the Federal City Council and the Board of Trade. Ground was broken for the new Walter E. Washington Convention Center on October 2, 1998. Another project which the Federal City Council supported was construction of the MCI Center (now the Verizon Center) in Chinatown. Along with the Greater Washington Board of Trade and other private groups, the Federal City Council‚Äînot public officials, fans, or sports interests‚Äîpushed for a new arena downtown. Abe Pollin was the owner of the Washington Capitals and Washington Bullets, professional hockey and basketball teams (respectively) which played at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. But the Capital Centre was a small, aging facility, and there seemed an opportunity to bring the teams back into the District of Columbia. The effort began in the summer of 1993, when Federal City Council president Ann Dore McLaughlin had a casual conversation with Gordon Gund, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers professional basketball team, and learned of the \\"Cleveland model\\" for a public-private partnership to build a basketball arena in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. McLaughlin later shared this information with then-D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, who was enthusiastic but emphasized that the private sector must take the lead on the effort. McLaughlin began having talks with Pollin's friends and associates, and members of Pollin's staff. In early November, the Board of Trade sought and won a meeting with Pollin. Pollin said he had received several offers to sell both teams, and was likely to do so unless a first-class sports arena could be built. On December 16, the Federal City Council hosted a meeting with the Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce, and city officials to decide to take action. The Federal City Council, Board of Trade, and D.C. Chamber of Commerce agreed at the meeting to jointly conduct a study of the arena issue. The study identified several challenges, but also discovered that many sports teams were moving back into downtown areas from suburban sites. The study also identified several potential sites for the new arena. The city dropped out of the project so as not to appear to be raiding another jurisdiction's sports teams. The Greater Washington Board of Trade initially led talks with Pollin, which began in mid-January, until Maryland officials pointed out that‚Äîas a representative of businesses in Maryland and Virginia, not just D.C.‚Äîthe group had a conflict of interest. Wanting to bring the sports teams back to the city, the Federal City Council took over the talks and successfully convinced Pollin to move his teams.; The Federal City Council hired several nationally known sports arena and financial consultants to conduct research into the financial feasibility of the proposed arena. These consultants also participated in talks with Pollin. The Federal City Council also successfully pressed the city to provide financing for the project and to help clear away permitting and construction hurdles.; ; Construction on the MCI Center began in 1994 and ended in 1995. The Federal City Council was less successful in keeping the Washington Redskins professional football team in town. In 1991 and 1992, team owner Jack Kent Cooke wanted a new stadium, but the cash-strapped city wanted to renovate Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. When talks between the city and Cooke broke down, Federal City Council officials tried to restart them. Cooke cancelled the talks, and then announced he was building a new stadium in Landover, Maryland. The Federal City Council and its Committee on Public Education remained active on education issues in the 1990s. The council promoted privatization of the city's public schools in early 1994, and the committee issued a major report in January 1995 strongly criticizing the performance of the District of Columbia Public Schools. Although there were some improvements, the school system had declined in quality in the past six years, the report said. In June 1995, the Federal City Council endorsed private management of low-performing schools. The Federal City Council also opposed casino gambling in the District, and paid for a study of the District's finances which was highly critical of the city's excessive spending and lack of revenue. It supported a 1995 plan by Mayor Marion Barry to spend $2 billion improving New York Avenue NE,; efforts to build a local cultural center, downtown revitalization, an effort to give the District a delegate in the United States Senate, and a National Museum of American Music (to be part of the Smithsonian Institution).; ; ; ; In the late 1990s, the Federal City Council adopted its first strategic plan. =2000s: Moving away from economic development= The Federal City Council actively promoted the mayoral takeover of D.C.'s public schools, which led to the hiring of new schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee. Under the leadership of chairman Terence Golden in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Federal City Council began changing its focus away from big-budget infrastructure projects and toward more \\"community living\\" initiatives such as the creation of affordable housing, improved public schools, anti-drug and anti-crime initiatives, and support programs for at- risk youth. The organization spent two years trying to convince the federal government to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the White House (to no avail); ; ; ; pushed a Constitutional amendment to give the District a seat in the House, and supported a legal brief in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), supporting the city's strict gun control law. It did, however, support one major construction project, the new Nationals Park (a baseball stadium for the city's new Major League Baseball franchise, the Washington Nationals). Education reform continued to draw the organization's attention as well. The Federal City Council funded a study of the school system's administration, staff training, and curriculum by McKinsey & Company in 2001. The study led the D.C. Public Schools to adopt a five-year plan, titled \\"Business Plan for Strategic Reform\\", for making system wide improvements. Two years later, the organization partnered with the Kimsey Foundation and the Morino Institute to fund on-the-job training for 40 school principals over five years. In 2004, the Federal City Council led an effort to raise private money to help improve the salary of the Superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools. The move came as the city struggled to find a replacement for Paul L. Vance, who resigned in November 2003. In 2006, the organization quietly told city officials that it was deeply unhappy with the leadership provided by Clifford P. Janey, Vance's successor. It also funded a $400,000 study the same year on behalf of incoming mayor Adrian Fenty on how to take over the public school system. Fenty subsequently proposed major legislative changes that gave the mayor far greater power over the DCPS.; ; These were approved by the city council in April 2007 and permitted to become law by the United States Congress.; ; Janney was fired by Mayor Adrian Fenty on June 12, 2007, and Michelle Rhee installed as the city's new Chancellor of Public Schools.; Certain statements by Rhee were misconstrued by opponents of the school takeover, who said that Rhee had to seek Federal City Council approval of all major city schools policy changes. Although Rhee never made any such statement, the claims gained some traction among some public school activists. But the Federal City Council was, according to The Washington Post reporter Mike DeBonis, \\"a prime supporter of Fenty's education reform efforts.\\" Reform of city finances and government also occupied the Federal City Council. In 2001, at the behest of Natwar M. Gandhi, D.C.'s chief financial officer, the organization agreed to update its 1994 study on city revenues in order to build a consensus in Congress for a restructuring of the District's financing mechanisms. The report, Assessing the District's Financial Position, released in March 2002, called for a commuter tax and restoration of an annual federal payment in lieu of property taxes. The report also warned of half-billion dollar budget deficits if city spending were not slashed and tax cuts deferred. In 2006, the organization raised $100,000 to help incoming chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Vincent C. Gray, fund a multiyear strategy plan for council action. It also raised more than $400,000 to help Fenty pay for an improved candidate recruitment process for his mayoral cabinet, and for a study on how to take over the public school system. For the first time since the 1980s, the organization made another major push to improve funding for Metro. In September 2004, the Federal City Council joined with the Board of Trade and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments to create a task force to study Metro's revenues and financing. The group proposed that local governments dedicate a portion of their sales tax to Metro, but the plan generated no interest by local or state governments.; =2010s: Narrowed priorities= Former D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams was appointed chief executive officer/executive director of the Federal City Council in 2012. In the 2010s, the Federal City Council continued to tackle many small issues in an attempt to improve the livability of Washington, D.C. These included improving the streetscape of 10th Street SW (also known as L'Enfant Promenade), adding a bus-only lane and streetcar to K Street NW in downtown, reopening Pennsylvania Avenue NW near the White House, addressing congestion on downtown streets, improving D.C.'s tourism industry, supporting the 2015 merger between Exelon and Pepco.; ; In 2011, the Federal City Council began work on a new strategic plan to guide the organization's decision-making. It was the first strategic plan for the organization in more than a decade. The plan identified four key priorities: Lowering unemployment by developing new industries (its top priority), ensuring the city's financial stability and integrity (its second priority), improving public education, and improving city infrastructure. By design, the strategic plan closely tracked the major priorities of newly elected Mayor Vincent C. Gray. In April 2012, the Federal City Council hired former mayor Anthony Williams as its new executive director. He replaced eight-year veteran John W. Hill, Jr. Williams reiterated the organization's focus on jobs, government effectiveness and efficiency, and improvements to infrastructure. Williams' appointment was widely seen by the news media as a significant boost to the organization's influence. To work toward the goal of lower unemployment, the Federal City Council opposed enactment in 2013 of a \\"living wage\\" law in the District of Columbia. The organization also joined an effort, spearheaded by The 2030 Group, to plan a multi-decade strategy for helping seven key industries in the region grow as well as how to encourage greater economic diversification. Tax issues largely occupied the group's attention when it came to the city's financial stability. The Federal City Council supported a successful city sales tax on gym memberships and yoga classes that generated $5 million a year. The organization backed the \\"wellness tax\\" in order to pay for a city council-enacted income tax cut that cost $143 million a year. The Federal City Council also supported the D.C. Tax Revision Commission, and members of the council served on the commission. The commission recommended changes to the District's tax code (including adding a bracket for middle-income earners and an increase in the standard deduction) which made it the second-most progressive in the nation. However, the organization also supported a bid to make the District of Columbia the American host-city candidate for the 2024 Summer Olympics. As the Federal City Council saw it, the bid gave the region an opportunity to engage in forward-looking plans that would ensure the region's economic stability by developing infrastructure, transportation, tourism, cultural facilities, and sporting venues that would last for 30 to 40 years. The Federal City Council was active on a much wider range of infrastructure initiatives. It advocated in 2012 creation of a public-private investment trust fund to help rebuild and improve the city's parks, public transit system, and sewer system. It established an internal task force to identify new means of financing bridge improvement, repair, and replacement; a new city jail; and improvements to city-owned golf courses. In 2013, the organization announced the creation of the Anacostia Waterfront Trust to coordinate regional efforts to end the continuing pollution of the Anacostia River and to begin cleanup efforts of the riverbed. Doug Siglin, formerly the federal affairs director for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, was named executive director of the Trust. The Federal City Council agreed to back a multibillion-dollar federal plan to end raw sewage flows into the river; mitigation of greywater, surface runoff, and urban runoff into the river; and research into the best way to address the deep deposits of dangerous contaminants on the river bottom. As part of its Anacostia River initiative, the council supported legislation (enacted in 2014) banning the use of polystyrene foam containers for use by food carryout providers. It also continued work to preserve and improve Union Station, and worked closely with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, Amtrak, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and local real estate developer Akridge to begin work on Burnham Place‚Äîa $1.5 billion mixed-use development that will build a new passenger terminal and retail, residential, and office buildings over the tracks (while adding a large parking garage beneath the tracks). This included studying the infrastructure and architectural/engineering aspects of Union Station and identifying as many sources for funding and financing as possible. From 2010 to 2015, the Federal City Council remained largely quiet on issues facing Metro and DC Streetcar, however. However, the organization did undertake a study of Metro in 2015 which led to a November 2016 report that called for a federal takeover of the transit agency if its three state-level partners did not agree to radically reconstitute Metro's governance structure. The report called for Metro's board to be drastically reduced in number and to be composed of transit professionals rather than political appointees. It also called for weaker protections for Metro's trade unions, and for each state- level partner to adopt a dedicated tax to support Metro's capital needs and operations. The Federal City Council said it would attempt to build a coalition, consisting primarily of the region's largest employers and businesses with the most revenue, to support the changes. Within two weeks, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and the Greater Washington Board of Trade had signed on to the proposals. The state of Virginia agreed to back the idea of a smaller, more professional board. The Federal City Council was somewhat inactive on education reform for the first half of the 2010s. It quietly supported the education reforms planned and implemented by public schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee and her successor, Kaya Henderson. The council first drew media attention in 2016, when the organization's executive director agreed to co-chair a mayoral panel studying improvements to the city's public and charter schools. By 2016, the Federal City Council had expanded on its strategic plan by agreeing conduct more research into the city's problems, as well as act as a lobbyist for business before the Council of the District of Columbia. Lobbying came to the forefront due to the formation in 2001 of the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, a progressive think tank focused on local issues founded by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As part of its lobbying effort, the Federal City Council sent representatives on a trade mission to China and worked to defeat a proposed paid family leave bill. Projects On several occasions, the Federal City Council has created subsidiary organizations to take on tasks of a specific geographic or technical nature. Some of these have proven highly influential in themselves. Short-term initiatives include a 1963 effort to demolish temporary building on the National Mall, a 1988 task force to win federal approval for the construction of an international trade center, the early 1990s Downtown Interactive Task Force, a 2002 effort to lobby the federal government for more money for the District of Columbia (led by Robert G. Liberatore, a senior vice president at DaimlerChrysler), and a 2012 working group to identify new means of financing infrastructure. The Federal City Council has, on occasion, created longer-lived, semi-permanent or permanent subsidiaries or organizations as well. =Downtown Progress= The first longer-term project initiated by the Federal City Council was Downtown Progress. In 1958, the Federal City Council recommended the creation of a new organization to attract business investment in the former retail core of the District of Columbia. On April 1, 1960, this organization, the National Capital Downtown Committee, Inc.‚Äîbetter known as \\"Downtown Progress\\"‚Äîwas formed as a joint effort of the Federal City Council and a federal agency, the National Capital Planning Commission. Knox Banner was Downtown Progress' long- time leader. The group, which represented primarily very large businesses, produced a number of extensive, expensive plans to redevelop downtown D.C. and build an extensive network of subway lines beneath the area. The organization helped to win the creation of the Washington Metro, and development of the Washington Convention Center. It was not successful, however, in pushing for a similar network of tunnels and roadways that would accommodate rapid-transit buses and truck delivery. Downtown Progress also worked closely with the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation to develop plans for the restoration and redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue NW in the 1960s and 1970s, and worked with the National Park Service to restore Ford's Theatre in 1968. =Municipal Research Bureau= The second long-term organization created by the Federal City Council was the Municipal Research Bureau. Created in 1974, it was led by Philip M. Dearborn, Jr., an expert in municipal finance and director of the Brookings Institution's Greater Washington Research Program. Its mission was to provide general research on issues important to the District of Columbia. It merged with the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies in 1978 to become the Greater Washington Research Center. The Greater Washington Research Center merged with the Brookings Institution in 2001. =The Economic Club of Washington, D.C.= In 1986, the Federal City Council spawned The Economic Club of Washington, D.C. The group formed in response to the nationalization and globalization of many D.C. businesses, as well as the rapid increase in \\"new economy\\" businesses inside the city and in the surrounding suburbs. There was a sense that many of the area's mid- and top-level managers were not from the area, felt little attachment to the region, and had few friends in the city. The Economic Club was founded by Federal City Council members Ed Hoffman (president of Woodward & Lothrop) and R. Robert Linowes (a successful local attorney). The goal was two-fold: First, to provide a way for business leaders to socialize, become acquainted with one another, and form a sense of community; second, to expose its members to new thinking and ideas in the realm of economics. The group has since become \\"a cornerstone of the Washington business community\\", largely on the basis of its ability to bring a group of top-level business leaders together to listen to policymakers. (It does not advocate for, lobby on behalf of, or speak for the business community.) =Committee on Public Education= D.C. Committee on Public Education (a group of parents and business, religious, and civic leaders), in 1988. When released on June 20, 1989, the report recommended spending $355 million over the next five years to extend the school day by five hours (to a 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. schedule); extend the school year by 40 days; construct new schools; repair existing schools; and add stronger math and science programs and multicultural education to the curriculum. To pay for the plan, the Federal City Council's team suggested cutting administrative costs by $8.5 million, eliminating 400 central staff positions, closing some schools, and selling some school property. The Committee on Public Education remained active for many years, issuing reports critical of the public school system. =Agenda Progress and D.C. Agenda= Another major project of the Federal City Council was Agenda Progress. This project came about in 1991 after former President Jimmy Carter asked members of the Federal City Council whether they believed their efforts would completely turn the city around in five to ten years. None did. Agenda Process was launched shortly after Carter's speech as a means to identify projects and mechanisms that would meet the challenge Carter set for the group. Agenda Progress spent 1993 and 1994 cooperating with the Brookings Institution on a study of the finances of the District of Columbia. This study deeply influenced the Clinton administration's decision to impose the District of Columbia Financial Control Board on the city in 1995. In 1995, Agenda Progress was renamed D.C. Agenda, and led by former Barry administration official James O. Gibson. Its original purpose was to serve as an unofficial transition committee at the start of Marion Barry's fourth term (1995 to 1999) as mayor. It represented the interests of large corporations and nonprofits doing business with city, providing them with research and technical assistance. In time, D.C. Agenda shifted its focus to building coalitions to support its agenda on city governance and financial/tax reform, improved support for economic development, neighborhood redevelopment, and at-risk youth intervention. In some cases, D.C. Agenda mimicked or implemented city functions and acted as a liaison with corporations or nonprofits to implement public policy. D.C. Agenda also had a subsidiary body, the D.C. Agenda Support Corporation, led by former District of Columbia Administrator Carol Thompson Cole. D.C. Agenda had several subcommittees as well, including an Economic Development Strategy Group (organized in 1996 and led by local attorney Dana Stebbins). In 1997, D.C. Agenda proposed creating a nonprofit, tax-exempt, public-private economic development corporation. The organization, dominated by private developers, would have broad power (including eminent domain and the right to own property) to direct planning and engage in redevelopment of the city's downtown and business corridors. The proposal asked for $50 million in cash from the federal government (with 40 percent earmarked for redevelopment efforts by other nonprofits), and $250 million in redistributable tax credits and surplus federal property. The D.C. Agenda proposal became the National Capital Revitalization Corp., which was created by law adopted by the Council of the District of Columbia in April 1998.; D.C. Agenda created the nonprofit D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation in 1999. The trust worked to obtain government and corporate grants to help at-risk youth and build after-school programs at city public schools. After several years of mismanagement, the trust collapsed and dissolved in April 2016. In 2000, D.C. Agenda began collecting funds from the public as part of a political campaign to support a referendum that would dramatically alter the powers of the D.C. State Board of Education. More than $80,000 was collected from 25 individuals. But the District of Columbia Office of Campaign Finance found that D.C. Agenda had failed to register as a political action committee, as required by law. D.C. Agenda president John H. McKoy agreed to return all the funds to avoid a fine. D.C. Agenda dissolved in May 2004 after failing to raise the $1.7 million a year its annual budget required. Several of the organization's subsidiary efforts, such as the Neighborhood Information Service, the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation Awards, and Neighborhood College, were transferred to other nonprofits in the area. =Washington, DC Police Foundation= The Washington, DC Police Foundation (also known as the National Capital Police Fund) is a grant-making arm of the Federal City Council which provides grants to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD). According to the Federal City Council, the foundation was created in 2000. It made a $10,000 grant to the MPD in 2004 to purchase stolen goods tracking software, and a $30,000 grant in 2005 to allow the MPD to purchase automobiles with GPS tags for use as \\"bait cars\\". It is unclear how the foundation generates its income. =Anacostia Waterfront Trust= In October 2013, the Federal City Council established a new nonprofit, the Anacostia Waterfront Trust, to coordinated regional and federal efforts to prevent the dumping of raw sewage and toxic materials into the Anacostia River, and to research ways in how best to handle the contaminants already on the riverbed. The organization began researching the history of Anacostia Park in 2016, in an attempt to identify past plans for the park. The effort was a prelude to beginning an effort to craft a strategic vision for the park that would allow for its sustainable development. The Trust also supported the D.C. government's plan for trading \\"stormwater retention credits\\" (similar to carbon credits) among businesses in an effort to reduce low-quality runoff into the Anacostia. About the Federal City Council =Influence= The Federal City Council is highly influential in real estate development and urban planning issues in the District of Columbia. It is the Federal City Council's focus on construction and development that, according to The Washington Post reporter David Leonhardt, has allowed the organization to be at the forefront in promoting \\"almost every major downtown development project since World War II\\", including Southwest urban renewal, the entire Washington Metro, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and the renovation of Union Station. In the late 1960s through the late 1970s, The Washington Post said, the organization \\"sometimes carried more clout on Capitol Hill than the District's political leadership.\\" Post columnist Colbert I. King said its power rivaled that of the city council in 2006, while Post reporters Marc Fisher and Valerie Strauss in 1997 said the group consisted of \\"Washington's corporate and governmental elite\\". Mark Bisnow of the Washington Business Journal called the Federal City Council \\"the most important organization in Washington you've never heard of\\" in 2005 and Post reporter Mike DeBonis described it as \\"the city's ultimate conglomeration of economic power\\". Post reporter Jerry Knight called the organization \\"self-appointed...business Brahmins\\" in 1989, while Colbert I. King said in 2007 that the Federal City Council was synonymous with the Washington establishment. In 2012, however, The Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein argued that the Federal City Council lost much of its influence in the first decade of the 21st century. He argued that, in part, the organization was a victim of its success, having accomplished most of its goals. This has allowed members of the organization to turn their attention elsewhere. He also asserted it lacked effective and visionary leadership, that globalization of local businesses had robbed the organization of support, that excessive partisanship at the federal and state levels make progress nearly impossible, and that many of the problems now confronting the city are regional in nature. Its members admit to being self-interested and looking out for their own interests, but claim they do so only to make the city more livable. The group has also been criticized for ignoring the views of residents affected by Federal City Council projects, of lacking accountability, and pursuing an agenda at odds with those of the public. =Avoiding press attention= The Federal City Council has a longstanding unofficial policy of avoiding press attention and publicity, although in 2016 executive director Anthony Williams said that the group would be implementing some incremental changes to its policy of avoiding the press. The group's media-avoidance policy has been characterized in various ways. The Economist described it in 1988 as a \\"select and shadowy gathering of some of the city's top business and professional people\\", \\"[o]perating on the old-boy network\\". In 1997, reporter Bradford McKee called the organization \\"secretive\\" and \\"a shadow chamber of commerce and phantom government...\\" In 2014, Jonathan O'Connell at The Washington Post called it \\"historically insular\\". Other descriptions of the group's publicity shyness have been more positive. Washington Post columnist Colbert I. King has dismissed theories that the organization is \\"a clandestine outfit\\", noting it merely \\"work[s] quietly behind the scenes on city issues\\". This view is echoed by Post reporters Yolanda Woodlee and Ashlee Clark. Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein has argued that the organization's avoidance of publicity has been one of the reasons it has been so successful. =Membership= The Federal City Council is a private, nonprofit organization of business people, civic leaders, former federal executive branch officials, and local and federal politicians. Membership in the organization is by invitation only. Members are known as \\"trustees\\", and the membership group is known as the Board of Washington Trustees. The Washington Business Journal says the organization declines to identify its members. However, as of December 2016 the organization provides the names of about 225 trustees and \\"trustee emeritus\\" on its Web site. The Federal City Council's members include some of the city's wealthiest and most civic-minded businesspeople. The members have been described as the representative of the city's \\"business elite\\" and the organization as the \\"key business voice\\" in the city. Reports of the number of members have varied over time. The Washington Post said it had either 100 or 137 members in 1975, 150 members in 1994, 150 members in 2000 and 2002, 190 members in 2002, more than 250 members in 2003, 194 members in 2004, either 170 or 180 members in 2011, and 170 members in 2012. As of 2003, the Federal City Council and the Washington Board of Trade shared many members, George Mason University professor Michael K. Fauntroy characterized the Federal City Council as \\"more of an elitist group than the Board\\". As late as 1994, the Federal City Council's membership was overwhelmingly white. Terence C. Golden, the organization's chairman in 2004, admitted, \\"This was basically a white man's business organization in a city that was very divided\\". The Federal City Council at one point had an ex officio class of membership. These individuals include people such as Cabinet secretaries and local university presidents. As of 1994, there were about 50 ex-officio members. =Governance, presidents, and chairmen= Leadership of the Federal City Council consists of a president and a chairman of the Washington Board of Trustees. A presidential term is one year. A president may succeed him or her self, there are no term limits, and most presidents serve several years. The board meets twice a year. The chairman is assisted by a vice chairman. Additional officers include a secretary; treasurer; two vice presidents; vice presidents for federal relations, membership, membership engagement, nominations, and strategic planning; a general counsel; and the chief executive officer/executive director. The board elects 28 members to serve on an executive committee, which meets monthly and governs the organization between board meetings. Ex officio members of the executive committee (who have no voting rights) include the chairs of the Federal City Council's standing committees and task forces, the chair of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, and the chair of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce. In 1958, the organization established a \\"national advisory board\\" consisting of individuals who may have once lived in Washington, D.C., or who have a strong interest in the city but do not live there. These individuals were often former members of Congress, former executive branch department heads, or corporate executives. This body apparently no longer exists. A partial list of the presidents of the Federal City Council includes: # George A. Garrett - November 1954 to December 1961 # Gordon Gray - January 1962 to 1963; # William P. Rogers - September 1963 to September 1965 # Stephen Ailes - September 1965 to September 1970 # George C. McGhee - September 1970 to 1974 # Sol Linowitz - 1974 to September 1978 # James T. Lynn - September 1978 to September 1983 # Harry McPherson - September 1983 to September 1990 # Ann Dore McLaughlin - September 1990 to September 1995 # Tom Foley - September 1995 to September 1998; # Bob Dole - September 1998 to 2002; ; ; # Fred Thompson - November 2002 to October 2005 # Frank Keating - October 2005 to November 2012 # Thomas M. Davis - December 2012 to present The chairmanship of the board of directors turns over frequently. As of 2016, the chairman was Robert J. Flanagan, construction (Clark Enterprises) and investment (CNF Investments) executive first elected on December 3, 2012. Past chairmen include Washington Gas executive Donald S. Bittinger;; and Riggs Bank chairmen Vincent C. Burke and Lewellyn Jennings; hotel executive Terence C. Golden, and construction executive Linda Rabbitt. The vice chairman as of 2016 was hotel executive W. Edward Walter. =Budget and other staff= Although funding for the Federal City Council is not clear, its budget is substantial. Its fiscal 2014 budget was $2.2 million, up from $1.5 million in fiscal 2013. As of April 2012, the news media reported that the Federal City Council had a small staff of just five people (up from four staff in 1994). However, the organization's Web site lists 11 staff (including two who work for the Anacostia Waterfront Trust). Its internal staff structure is not clear, and there have been many title changes over the years. The organization's day-to-day operations are overseen by a chief executive officer/executive director. Chief executive officers/executive directors have included: *G. Yates Cook - 1954 to 1974 *Kenneth R. Sparks - 1974 to September 2004; ; *John W. Hill, Jr. - October 2004 to June 2012 *Anthony A. Williams - July 2012 to present (as of November 2016) Michael F. Brimmer served as its deputy executive director from 1975 to 1985. He was followed by David Perry, who served from 1985 to about 2005.; Other staff include a chief operating officer, managing director,; a director of finance and administration, a director of membership and events, a senior research associate, and a research associate. In 2013, the position of managing director was retitled deputy executive director.

Functioning as a prototype for the much larger scale Everglades Construction Project, the ENRP was designed to model the process of using Stormwater treatment areas (STAs) to remove nutrients, especially phosphorus, from agricultural runoff entering the Everglades. Description Changes in the biotic integrity of the Everglades ecosystem has been largely attributed to the introduction of nutrient-rich runoff from the Everglades Agricultural Area. In 1994, The Everglades Forever Act authorized a 40,000-acre construction project (the Everglades Construction Program) that would utilize STAs as a way to clean water headed for Everglades National Park of nutrients that would throw the fragile ecosystem out of balance. Never before had a project of that size been managed and so the ENRP was created as an opportunity to gain perspective in the construction and operation of wetlands for nutrient removal. It was designed using 3,815 acres of land as opposed to the 40,000+ acres proposed for the final project. Its primary goal was to reduce the levels of phosphorus entering Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA-1) and to offer critical data and insight into the design and operation of the much larger scale project to come. Management The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) conducted construction, research and monitoring of the project. This required building structural elements like levees and pump stations and also establishing vegetation. Particular emergent plants such as cattails were employed for their ability to uptake phosphorus out of the water as a means of short term removal, as well as absorbing nutrients into dead plant matter and soil particles for long term removal. Information gained from the experiment allowed for SFWMD to both anticipate potential problems and ensure that optimized phosphorus retention results could be achieved by STA technology at a comparatively lower cost.

All three were either Marxist or communist during the 1920s‚Äì1930s and then became an anti- communist by 1939. Background View of Aberdeen, Washington, where Fixx began lifelong friendship with Robert Cantwell Calvin Fixx was born \\"Calvin Henry Fix\\" in Lyman, Idaho, on August 1, 1906, the son of Henry Martin Fix (1883‚Äì1971) and Maggie Priscilla Smith Fix (1888‚Äì1958). He had two brothers, Ford and Harley, and a sister, Georgia. He attended high school in Aberdeen, Washington, where he began a lifelong friendship with Robert Cantwell. He attended business school in Aberdeen briefly. Cantwell and Fixx dreamed of \\"escaping to New York.\\" Career Crowd gathering at Wall Street and Broad Street after 1929 crash - the Great Depression shaped Fixx's experience in New York City In 1927, Fixx hitchhiked cross-country to New York City. He took a part-time job in a Greenwich Village bookshop and wrote freelance book reviews. He took other jobs, such as secretary to author Lyle Saxon. At this time, he added a second \\"x\\" to his surname because, he said, \\"a verb cannot be a name.\\" He began to act informally as Cantwell's agent and helped him publish his first major short story. In 1929, he encouraged Robert Cantwell to come to New York City and they shared a flat in Greenwich Village.\\" In 1936, he joined TIME with Robert Cantwell, Robert Fitzgerald, and James Agee. In early 1939, Fitzgerald resigned. In April 1939, Chambers was hired by Henry Luce, and Fixx joined Chambers in the Books section. In 1940, William Saroyan lists Fixx among \\"contributing editors\\" at Time in Saroyan's play, Love's Old Sweet Song. In October 1942, while working in Time's \\"Back of the Book\\" section with Chambers, Fixx suffered a \\"severe heart attack\\", most probably brought on by the routine he and Chambers had adopted of \\"work[ing] a day and a half nonstop, stimulating themselves with six packs of cigarettes and a continual stream of coffee\\".Hartshorn, L. (2013), Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers and the Case That Ignited McCarthyism, McFarland & Company, Jefferson, North Carolina and London, p. 66 Luce gave him a year's leave and salary to recover. (Wilder Hobson succeeded Fixx as assistant editor of Books.) Chambers also suffered a heart attack a month later and also went on leave. (Allen Weinstein notes that the FBI had visited Chambers in May 1942 to question him about his Communist activities. ) Upon Fixx's return, in 1943, he gave up editorial work for \\"special projects\\" (as did Chambers). He also worked in the public relations department. Personal life and death Residential street in Jackson Heights, Queens, where Fixx lived much of his life On October 31, 1930, Fixx married Marlys Virginia Fuller (1906‚Äì2004) of Detroit, Michigan, a graduate of the 1929 class at Northwestern University. They lived at 3328 81 Street, Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. According to Robert Fitzgerald, Fixx was a Mormon. Fixx's wife Marlys was Anglican. After his death, she worked at Oberlin College as house mother/Director of May Cottage. When son Jim Fixx died, he left his estate to her, worth several million dollars. Calvin Fixx died age 43 on March 3, 1950, of a second heart attack, in an Atlantic City hospital. Surviving him were his wife, both parents, son James, daughter Catherine, brothers Ford and Harley, and sister Georgia. His son, Jim Fixx, would also die of a heart attack, at the age of 52 in 1984. Fixx is buried in Carmel, New York, in the Loudonsville Cemetery, in Putnam County, New York. Impact =T.S. Matthews Staff= Map of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39)‚Äìthe event that epitomized the radicalism of Fixx, Cantwell, and their generation Fixx, close colleagues, and many staff members as of the 1930s helped elevate TIME‚Äì\\"interstitial intellectuals,\\" as historian Robert Vanderlan has called them. Colleague and best-selling author John Hersey described them as follows: > Time was in an interesting phase; an editor named Tom Matthews had gathered > a brilliant group of writers, including James Agee, Robert Fitzgerald, > Whittaker Chambers, Robert Cantwell, Louis Kronenberger, and Calvin Fixx... > They were dazzling. Time's style was still very hokey‚Äî\\"backward ran > sentences till reeled the mind\\"‚Äîbut I could tell, even as a neophyte, who > had written each of the pieces in the magazine, because each of these > writers had such a distinctive voice. =Colleagues= Fixx's death at age 43 profoundly affected his close friends. His death helped take away all motivation in Cantwell to write. In his memoir, Chambers described Fixx as \\"my closest friend at Time. Chambers recorded the death in a letter to another friend: > This morning, at 7 o'clock, died the friend who knew most about me, a man on > whom I built an absolute trust, and to whose wisdom, patience, courage, and > humility I constantly repaired‚ÄìCalvin Fixx.\\" Chambers took his son John to Fixx's funeral. Fixx was in charge of novelist Sloan Wilson when Wilson joined TIME. =Communism and the Hiss Case= Whittaker Chambers joined Robert Cantwell as close friend of Fixx's during their years at TIME In the 1930s during the Popular Front years, Fixx was either a member of the CPUSA or supportive of Marxism. By 1939 with the Hitler-Stalin Pact, he started toward Anti-Communism, following Cantwell and Chambers. In 1939, the triumvirate (Fixx, Cantwell, Chambers) challenged the Communist-controlled Time chapter of the Newspaper Guild by making a motion to send aid to Loyalists (Republicans) in the Spanish Civil War at a time, following the Hitler-Stalin Pact, Communists supported Nationalist (Falangists): they were defeated 42 to 3. During the first months of the Hiss Case (1948‚Äì1950), Chambers, feeling unable to face TIME offices, used to spend much time at Fixx's home. Supporters of Alger Hiss used Fixx's 1942 heart attack and 1950 death to criticize his 1942 supervisor Whittaker Chambers. Ardent Hiss supporter Meyer Zeligs elaborated how Chambers \\"drew into the orbit of this killing [work] schedule\\" Fixx. David Cort rewrote his own account: > A ghoulish episode occurred, instigated by that plausible Cagliostro on Time > magazine, Whittaker Chambers. His totally unnecessary routine of working his > foreign department through every night on black coffee reduced one willing > colleague, Calvin Fixx, to a heart attack. Subsequent writers repeated this charge, often near-verbatim from Cort.

In the late 1890s, Elmi the Tall \\"Elmi Dheire\\" in favour with the British at that time was appointed the Sultan or Ughaz of all the Gadabuursi in the British Protectorate. 'Elmi the tall thus supplanted the traditional line that has been in place since the 16th century, the traditional line of Ughaz Nur II and his successor, Ugas Roble II, who had fallen out of favor with the British. Ughaz 'Elmi's authority was recognized in an installation ceremony in 1917 in Zeila, the ancient port city. However the traditional successor of Ughaz Nur II, Ughaz Robleh II, remained the Sultan of the Gadabuursi's in the borders of Ethiopia. 'Elmi the Tall belonging to one of the Gadabuursi elders was a member of the delegation of Ughaz Nur II that had accompanied his visit to Egypt in the late 1870s and he was one of the elders who signed the treaty with the British at Zeila in 1884. 'Elmi the Tall's usurpation of the traditional Gadabuursi succession provoked other sub-clans and caused a lot of controversy. Many sub-clans, especially the rer Yunus or the Yunus branch felt it was their turn to vie for the Ughaz- ship. This sparked a conflict which was also conducted in poetic duels.

The tradition is commonly called the Ueda S≈çko Ry≈´ or Ueda Ry≈´ (Ry≈´ meaning \\"Tradition\\" or \\"School\\" in Japanese). The founder from whom the tradition takes its name was Sengoku period warlord Ueda S≈çko. The customs, etiquette and values of the samurai are woven throughout all aspects of the tradition's practice of chanoyu, a practice that has continued unbroken for over 400 years.  Ueda S≈çko  \\"Kuginuki-mon\\", the family crest of Ueda S≈çko. The crest represents a large nail-pull used in constructing temples. After first serving Niwa Nagahide as a page, Ueda S≈çko was later chosen by Toyotomi Hideyoshi as one of his aides and daimy≈ç. Ueda learned chanoyu from Sen no Rikyu and Furuta Oribe before establishing his own style of chanoyu, deeply influenced by the values and customs of the samurai of the Sengoku period (mid 15th-early 17th century). Since Ueda's time the Ueda School has continued for 16 generations under an iemoto system. The present and 16th iemoto is Ueda S≈çkei. Ueda S≈çko is famous as one of the leading garden designers of the Momoyama period (1568‚Äì1603). He is well known for designing and constructing many gardens listed in Japan as places of great scenic beauty. These include Shukkeien (Hiroshima prefecture), Tokushima Castle Front Palace Garden (also known as Sensh≈´kaku-teien, Tokushima Prefecture), Nagoya Castle Garden (Ninomaru-teien, Nagoya prefecture), Wakayama Castle's Nishinomaru-teien and Kokuwadera-teien (Wakayama prefecture). Following the Siege of Osaka (1614‚Äì1615), the Toyotomi clan was disbanded in 1619 and Ueda relocated to Hiroshima under his lord Asano Nagaakira who was to become daimy≈ç of the Geish≈´ Domain (Hiroshima Domain). Ueda was given a fief in the West of Hiroshima prefecture yielding 17,000 koku of rice (around 2,788 tonnes) and became Asano's chief retainer for the Geish≈´ Domain. As chief retainers of the Geishs≈´ Domain, the Ueda family governed their land in West Hiroshima for generations. S≈çko's chanoyu was passed down through the generations and continues to thrive today.  History  In 1619 (Fifth year of Ganwa Era), Asano Nagaakira was appointed as daimy≈ç of the Geish≈´ Domain, making him Lord of Aki Province and half of Bingo Province amounting to land of 426,500 koku of rice (roughly modern-day Hiroshima Prefecture). Ueda S≈çko went to Geish≈´ in special servitude to Lord Asano. S≈çko was assigned a fief 17,000 koku of rice in the West of Hiroshima prefecture to go with his appointment as Asano's Chief Retainer. S≈çko enlisted Nomura Ky≈´mu and Nakamura Mototomo as his vassals and granted them each a fief of 100 koku of rice. S≈çko invested the teaching of his style of chanoyu to the two families (a role called \\"Chaji Azukari\\" or \\"holders of the teachings of chanoyu\\"). Under S≈çko's direction, the Nomura and Nakamura families taught and conducted chanoyu for the Asano and Ueda families. In the middle of the Edo Period the number of people practicing chanoyu was increasing. The Sen Traditions of Tea were the first to establish the Iemoto system around this time. Then during the Bunka and Busei Eras (1804‚Äì1819) the S≈çden grading system was established, again by the Sen Traditions. The Ueda S≈çko Tradition spread wider than just the Samurai class of Geish≈´. The Ueda S≈çko Tradition was practiced by regular townsfolk and people throughout the Kansai and Chu-Shikoku regions. This called for a new level of formality around the teaching of the School. The retainers of the Ueda Tradition, Nomura S≈çky≈´, Nomura Yoky≈´, and Nakamura Taishin established a new S≈çden System in 1839 (Tenth year of Tenb≈ç Era). This new S≈çden System placed Ueda S≈çko's style of Tea into a form that was able to be transmitted in a systematic format through generations. It dictated the highest license, the Shin Daisu, was to be kept in the Ueda Family and the other licenses were to be issued by the Chaji Azukari. In the S≈çko sama o-kikigaki or Notes from S≈çko, there is the record \\"S≈çko received a license from Oribe\\". This shows the Ueda S≈çko Tradition transmitted through generations is a style of Tea heavily influenced by Oribe, and a tradition that places the Shin Daisu as the highest license achievable. The Domains of Japan were dissolved with the Meiji Restoration, and all Tea Masters serving the daimy≈çs of domains found themselves without employment. The 12th Grandmaster Ueda Yasuatsu was the head of the Ueda Family through the twilight years of the Tokugawa shogunate rule, and into the Meiji period. In 1870 (Third Year of Meiji) he retired from worldly affairs and became a Buddhist monk, taking the name J≈ç≈ç. Until his death in 1888 (21st Year of Meiji) J≈ç≈ç devoted himself to chanoyu and in this way his life resembled the life of Ueda S≈çko. J≈ç≈ç continued to employ Nakamura Kaid≈ç and Nomura Ensai as Chaji Azukari throughout the Meiji Period, and the two families served in this role until 1955 (30th Year of Sh≈çwa). The Ueda S≈çko Tradition of Tea continues today as a tradition representative of Warrior Tea, born in Momoyama Period (1568‚Äì1598) Japan. The warlords of this period lived in a ruthless time where the threat of death was an intimate part of daily life. The Tea of the Momoyama period samurai class is therefore a style of Tea that seeks quietude for the mind. The Ueda Tradition of Tea continues as a practice for learning one's true heart through the Way of Tea.  Characteristics of the Ueda S≈çko tradition of Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu)  The Ueda S≈çko Tradition of Chanoyu is: * a Warrior Class school of tea (chanoyu) that continues unbroken from the Momoyama Period (about 1573‚Äì1603) to the present day *a school where one can see the unique aesthetic of Ueda S≈çko, an aesthetic that combines the influence of (a) Riky≈´'s beauty of tranquility: a type of beauty that emerges from subtle movement in a world of stillness and shadows and (b) Oribe's beauty of liberation: an atmosphere of primordial emancipation that arises from a world of light, space and free- flowing forms. Ueda S≈çko combined the influence of both his teachers to create an elegant and dignified aesthetic referred to as \\"utsukushiki\\". * the only school that has restored the headquarters of the Iemoto to the original layout of the Edo Period Samurai residence complete with the tearoom complex ‚ÄòWaf≈´d≈ç‚Äô and shoin reception building. The Ueda school also maintains many historical tea equipages, artefacts, and ancient texts with great historical significance for the history of chanoyu * a school known for its dignified, elegant beauty. The characteristic movements of the Ueda S≈çko Tradition's tea preparing ceremony (temae) are dignified and beautiful. This is achieved by composing movements of straight lines and eliminating all unnecessary movement. The school emphasises the yin/yang balance in the practitioner which usually results in a stronger aesthetic for men and a softer aesthetic for women (in line with Samurai culture of the Momoyama Period). More specifically, the above points entail: * The tea preparing ceremonies (temae) are different for men and women * The way of bowing for men and women is different * The purifying cloth (fukusa) is worn on the right side of the obi (a samurai's sword is fixed in the left side of the obi and this side is left free out of respect for the sword, and in case one has to suddenly exit the tearoom, fix their sword to their obi and start battle) * The way of handling the bamboo ladle (hishaku) and purifying cloth (fukusa) is very distinctive in the Ueda Tradition. E.g. Men handle the bamboo ladle as if riding a horse in battle, resheathing their sword and draw water as if handling an arrow * The movements in the tea preparing ceremony (temae) are composed of straight lines, and the movements flow with the breath. Performing the ceremony in harmony with the breath rejuvenates one's spirit: the emphasis is on releasing one's breath and energy \\"from inside to out, from inside, to out\\" = Wabi-cha and Warrior Tea = Wabi-cha is a style of chanoyu developed in the Momoyama period that gives precedence to chanoyu practiced in koma (four and a half mat-size and smaller) tea rooms using rustic equipages amid a sombre atmosphere; all natural conclusions from emphasising the aesthetic concept of wabi. The Ueda Ry≈´ is a School of chanoyu that values wabi-cha and emphasises wabi aesthetics. Another dimension to the Ueda Ry≈´ is that since the Momoyama period it has continued as one of the unique Traditions of chanoyu known as bukeh-cha, or 'warrior tea', which are traditions of chanoyu that originated in and were developed by the samurai class. Accordingly, warrior tea traditions of chanoyu are noticeably rich with the culture and customs of the samurai. The Ueda School now has wide repute as a tradition representative of warrior tea. = Tea Drinking in the Ueda S≈çko tradition = The Ueda Tradition is a school of tea of the samurai class that originated in the Momoyama period (1568‚Äì1598). The warlords of this period lived in a ruthless time where the fear of death was present in daily life. The tea of the Momoyama period samurai class is therefore a style of tea that seeks quietude for the mind and strength of spirit. = The Temae of the Ueda S≈çko tradition = The temae (tea preparing ceremony) of the Ueda Tradition is often said to be elegant and beautiful. There are two reasons for this appearance. First, the actions of the temae are in straight lines with all unnecessary movement eliminated. This creates a clean, dignified appearance that is invigorating for the practitioner. Second, actions are performed similar to the in-to-out flow of the breath (e.g. cleaning the whisk (chasend≈çji), rotating the tea bowl and whisking the tea). With practice, the temae can be performed in natural flowing harmony with the breath. From an 'unshakeable core expanding out' is the fundamental direction of assertive action and the tea ceremony of the Ueda Tradition is based on this fundamental. To captures this in the temae, the practitioner moves at one with an energising in-to-out flow of breath. These two aspects of (1) invigorating, clean actions in straight lines, and (2) the strength of actions performed in harmony with the in-to-out flow of the breath, contribute to the dignified and beautiful appearance of the temae of the Ueda Tradition. = Utensils and the body = An ideal of the Ueda Tradition is for utensils and the body to come together in harmony. One therefore does not slouch or handle objects by moving just the arms. Instead, handling objects from the central axis of the body is of fundamental importance. Objects are handled with a composed and stable posture; at navel height, 3 cm behind the tip of the knees and with the space of an egg open under the arms. Objects are held firmly with the thumb and middle finger and the index finger is added more lightly. Objects are not placed down just by moving one's arms; the whole body is used when placing objects down. The eyes also focus on the utensil that is being used at that particular moment. Harmony is achieved when the utensil, body, arms, breath and eyes all move together.  Ueda S≈çko's teacher, Furuta Oribe  Furuta Oribe Âè§Áî∞ ÁπîÈÉ® ( ‚Äì July 6, 1615) is the most celebrated tea master in history after his teacher Sen Rikyu. Unlike the merchant Rikyu, Oribe was a member of the samurai class and he led the development of a style of tea suited to cultural values of the samurai class known as buke-cha (warrior tea). Oribe held daimy≈ç status and was originally a retainer of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi before serving the Tokugawa clan. Oribe became the foremost tea master in Japan after Riky≈´'s death, and taught the art of chanoyu to the 2nd Tokugawa sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Hidetada. Among his other famous tea ceremony students were Kobori Ensh≈´, Honami K≈çetsu and Ueda S≈çko. The artistic influence of the still-popular Oribe-ware style of ceramics is attributed to Oribe and bears his name accordingly. He also designed a style of stone lantern (t≈çr≈ç) for the roji tea garden, known as Oribe-d≈çr≈ç. During the Osaka Campaign of 1615, Oribe was suspected of treason against the Tokugawa and ordered to commit ritual disembowelment (seppuku), along with his son. As Oribe's family was wiped out following his seppuku, his tea legacy continued with Ueda S≈çko, a student of Oribe's for 24 years. S≈çko exiled to Shikoku following the Osaka Campaign for three years before being invited to serve the Asano clan as their chief retainer and tea master in the Hiroshima domain. One settled in Hiroshima, Ueda S≈çko defined his style of tea heavily influenced by Oribe.  Reconstruction of the Ueda Clan Residence of Hiroshima Castle  354x354px In the 5th year of the Genwa Era (1619) the Tokogawa Shogunate assigned the Geish≈´ Domain and the Yattsu District of the Bingo Domain to Asano Nagaakira, a total fief of 126,500 koku of rice. Ueda S≈çko relocated to Hiroshima with Nagaakira as a special guest of the Asano Clan. S≈çko was granted a stipend of 17,000 koku of rice by Nagaakira in the western Hiroshima Prefecture (originally 10,000 koku). He also received a residency on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle and there constructed a shoin reception hall and his tea hermitage called ‚ÄòWaf≈´d≈ç‚Äô (ÂíåÈ¢®Â†Ç). This continued as the official residence of the Ueda Clan until the samurai class were stripped of their feudal residencies in the Meiji Restoration. The Ueda Clan left their home of 250 years at Hiroshima Castle in 1871 (4th year of the Meiji Era). The Ueda Clan originally relocated to their secondary residence (shimoyashiki ‰∏ãÂ±ãÊï∑) and then settled in the Furue (Âè§Ê±ü) district of Hiroshima in the early years of the Sh≈çwa Era (1926‚Äì1989). Waf≈´d≈ç was reconstructed in the 5th year of Sh≈çwa (1982) with outer and inner tea gardens (uchiroji ÂÜÖÈú≤Âú∞, sotoroji Â§ñÈú≤Âú∞) and the sukiya tea house Ensh≈ç (ÈÅ†Èêò) based on the Waf≈´d≈ç built by S≈çko on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle. Then some years later in the 20th year of Heisei (2008), the reconstruction of the shoin reception hall (Êõ∏Èô¢Â±ãÊï∑), crossing bridge (ÂªäÊ©ã) between the shoin and Waf≈´d≈ç, a kusari-no-ma (Èéñ‰πãÈñì formal hanging kettle tearoom) and tsugi-no-ma (Ê¨°‰πãÈñì adjoining reception room) in Waf≈´d≈ç were also recreated as faithful as possible to S≈çko's Hiroshima Castle Waf≈´d≈ç. With this work, the residence of the Ueda Clan was recreated at the current home of the Ueda Tradition 137 years after the loss of Hiroshima Castle in the Meiji Restoration. Central Hiroshima city was devastated in the atomic bombing of 1945. It is therefore thanks to the current location of the Ueda Clan in Furue in the western district of Hiroshima city that the Clan's estate (historical art works and literature) survived the catastrophy. With the records and literature of the Clan unscathed, the recreation of the original Ueda Clan residence was made possible. S≈çko's stone purifying basins (ÊâãÊ∞¥Èâ¢), garden lanterns (ÁáàÁ±†) and garden stones (ÂΩπÁü≥) were handed down through the generations of the Ueda Clan. This stonework features in the current gardens of Waf≈´d≈ç and thus connects the current Waf≈´d≈ç with that of antiquity.  Genealogy of the Ueda S≈çko Ry≈´  The Ueda Family takes its name from the city of Ueda in Shinano (modern day Nagano Prefecture). The Ueda chose this name after descending from the Ogasawara Clan. The Ogasawara Clan was a Japanese samurai clan descended from the Seiwa Genji. The lineage from the Seiwa Genji runs: Seiwa Genji, ancestors of Minamoto no Yoshimitsu (aka Shinra Sabur≈ç Yoshimitsu), Takeda Clan, Ogasawara, Ueda. Ueda S≈çko's grandfather Shigeshi and father Shigemoto both served Niwa Nagahide and achieved military fame during the unsettled times of the Genki (1570‚Äì1573) and Tensh≈ç (1573‚Äì1592) Eras. In 1619 (Year 5 of the Genwa Era) Ueda S≈çko came to Hiroshima serving Asano Nagaakira. At this time S≈çko had two sons, the eldest Shigehide and his second son Shigemasa. Soon after settling in Hiroshima, S≈çko's eldest son Shigehide was called to reside in Edo Castle as a type of hostage to the Tokugawa Shogunate. S≈çko was a hatamoto (a samurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate of feudal Japan) with 5 thousand koku of land. In 1632 (9th year of the Kanei Era), with his eldest son still a hostage in Edo Castle, S≈çko's successor became his second son Shigemasa. Shigemasa's descendants retained a fief of 17 thousand koku of land and served as Chief Retainer for the Hiroshima Domain. The Meiji Restoration occurred during twelfth generation Ueda Yasuatsu's (Ueda Jy≈ç≈ç) time. The current retainer of the Ueda Family, Ueda S≈çkei, is the 16th generation following Ueda S≈çko.

First titled Waf≈´d≈ç S≈çshi (ÂíåÈ¢®Â†ÇÂÆóÂó£) and later received the buddhist name S≈çkei (ÂÆóÂÜè). Original name Jyunji (ÊΩ§‰∫å). Marked the 350th anniversary of the death of Ueda S≈çko with exhibitions in Osaka, Hiroshima and Tokyo. Completed a reconstruction of the original formal residence of the Ueda Clan that existed on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle. The reconstruction was made on the current grounds of the Ueda Tradition, 137 years after the loss of Hiroshima Castle in the Meiji Restoration.  Grand Retainers of the Chanoyu of the Ueda Clan ‰∏äÁî∞ÂÆ∂Ëå∂‰∫ãÈ†ê„ÇäÂ∏´ÁØÑ  The transmission of the style of chanoyu particular to the Ueda Clan is due to a special system devised by Ueda S≈çko. Ueda S≈çko founded a unique tradition of chanoyu alongside his duties as the Chief Retainer of the Domain of Hiroshima and Sh≈ç-Daimy≈ç (Â∞èÂ§ßÂêç) of a fief of 17,000 koku of rice. S≈çko and his descendants were dedicated to the practice of chanoyu and continued S≈çko's legacy for generations. But S≈çko and his successors did not teach people chanoyu directly. Instead, the teaching of the School was invested in two families. In 1632 (9th year of the Kanei Era ÂØõÊ∞∏‰πù), a man by the name of Nomura Yahee no Jy≈ç Moriyasu ÈáéÊùëÂΩåÂÖµË°õÂ∞âÁõõÂÆâ of Su≈ç Yanai (Âë®Èò≤Êü≥‰∫ï modern day Shimane Prefecture) relocated to Hiroshima to seek instruction in chanoyu from Ueda S≈çko. Moriyasu served S≈çko by governing a stipend of land worth 100 koku of rice. He later took his tonsure and the Buddhist name of Ky≈´mu (‰ºëÂ§¢) and became the first Grand Retainer of Ueda S≈çko's chanoyu. One of first generation Nomura Ky≈´mu's students of chanoyu was Nakamura Masachika-Chigen (‰∏≠ÊùëÈõÖË¶™„ÉªÁü•ÂÖÉ). He also served S≈çko by governing a stipend of land worth 100 koku of rice. After Ky≈´mu's death, Chigen succeeded Ky≈´mu, becoming the first generation of the Nakamura family to hold the title of Grand Retainer of the chanoyu of the Ueda clan. Ueda S≈çko therefore invested the teaching of his style of chanoyu in two families: the Nomura and Nakamura. These two families were employed by the Ueda clan to transmit the Ueda tradition of chanoyu through the generations. It is thanks to the Grand Retainers of the Nomura and Nakamura families that the Ueda tradition has been faithfully transmitted, unbroken, from Ueda S≈çko to the present day. After the death of 15th generation Nakamura Kaid≈ç (‰∏≠ÊùëÂø´Â†Ç) in 1906 (39th year of the Meiji Era), both the Nakamura and Nomura families were without successors. The role of 16th generation Grand Retainer was therefore awarded to their leading disciple Mukai Chikkad≈ç (Âêë‰∫ïÁ´πËù∏Â†Ç). Kakei Seid≈ç (Âä†Ë®àÈùôÂ†Ç) then succeeded Chikkad≈ç to serve as the 17th generation Grand Retainer before his death in 1955 (30th year of the Sh≈çwa Era). Seid≈ç was the last of the Grand Retainers of Ueda S≈çko's chanoyu. With his death, the system of delegating the transmission of the Ueda tradition of chanoyu came to an end. = First Generation Nomura Ky≈´mu ÈáéÊùë‰ºëÂ§¢ = Originally named Nomura Moriyasu (ÈáéÊùëÁõõÂÆâ), took the title and name Yahee no Jy≈ç (ÂΩåÂÖµË°õÂ∞â) and later the Buddhist name of Ky≈´mu (‰ºëÂ§¢). Originally from Su≈ç Yanai (Âë®Èò≤Êü≥‰∫ï modern day Shimane Prefecture). In the 9th year of the Kanei Era (1632 / ÂØõÊ∞∏Ôºô) he relocated to Hiroshima to learn chanoyu from S≈çko and became the Grand Retainer of the Ueda Clan's style of chanoyu along with serving S≈çko by governing a stipend of land worth 100 koku of rice.

Backcover Background The war between Portugal and Spain had begun with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and had resulted in the break up of the Iberian Union. After the peace of the Pyrenees in 1659, the independence of Portugal was threatened by a resurgent Spain, and thus Portugal asked for outside support. They turned to their old ally England but the Restoration of Charles II as monarch of England proved a concern. He had previously been allied to Spain through the Treaty of Brussels after Oliver Cromwell's Republic had been at war with Spain. Charles however immediately annulled the treaty citing King Philip IV of Spain's failure to aid in his restoration and instead answered Portugal's call for help.Davenport pp. 57-59 His marriage with Catherine of Braganza, renewed the alliance between England and Portugal despite the protestations of Spain. As part of the treaty a brigade was raised for service in Portugal in 1662 to help win her independence.Riley pp 54-56 The decision to send troops to Portugal came from the need to find employment for Cromwellian and Royalist veterans of the English Civil War, and the Portuguese military needed experienced veterans to help fight the Spanish. The infantry were raised from three New Model Army regiments in Scotland that were still not disbanded. The cavalry were raised from volunteers, the majority from the Dunkirk garrison having fought the Spanish there in 1658. English parliament was to raise, pay and equip the brigade, and then once in Portugal they would be paid by the Portuguese crown. Most of the soldiers were parliamentarians but also included many Catholic Royalist Irish and Scottish soldiers. They were formed, trained and commanded by Thomas Morgan a Welsh veteran soldier from the Dutch Revolt and the Civil War. Once formed the brigade consisted of two infantry regiments, each of 1,000 men, and a cavalry regiment, just under 1,000 men totalling for the brigade around 3,000 men.Glozier, pp. 63-68 Portugal Once in Portugal the British regiments at once were put into action but in the first few months of deployment, difficulties arose from the opposition of many Portuguese officers. To add to this, the Portuguese treated the British with contempt, not the least because of their protestant religion. Despite this the Portuguese soon recognised that the British were the more reliable component in the army and made a more serious impression on the Spanish than other troops in the Portuguese Army. The brigade, however, suffered with sickness, which accounted for many losses, and battle casualties were rarely ever replaced from home. The British army uniform had red jackets (doublets) as a colour having been established during the Elizabethan times. By the 1660s red had become the predominant colour in British uniforms since the creation of the New Model Army in 1645. The regiment of infantry or horse was usually just designated as a regiment number, and not by the name of the colonel as was custom at the time. The first colonel was Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, who also commanded the British Brigade in the early stages. In 1662 he was succeeded, by the Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg in 1663 who was sent as military adviser to Lisbon with the secret approval of Charles II. Louis XIV of France, in order not to infringe the treaty just made with Spain, deprived Schomberg of his French officers. In the field, however, the regiment was commanded by Michael Dongan, later by Lawrence Dempsey and finally by Frederick's son Meinhardt Schomberg.Childs pp. 169-71 The first infantry regiment was commanded by Henry Pearson while the second infantry regiment was commanded by James Apsley as colonel, and also Francis Moore as acting colonel. In 1665 the 2nd regiment was commanded by William Sheldon.Riley pp. 85-87 In the spring of 1663, a Spanish army under the command of Don Juan de Austria, son of Philip IV of Spain, had overrun the greater part of south Portugal with the important city of √âvora taken on 22 May. This opened up for potential march on Lisbon, to the west. The British brigade moved with the Portuguese army under Sancho Manoel de Vilhena and met up with the Spanish army outside √âvora.McMurdo pp 419-20 At the Battle of Ameixial fought nearby, however, the Anglo-Portuguese swiftly defeated the Spanish - Juan of Austria's standard was captured when his squadron was almost wiped out.Great Britain Royal Manuscripts, pp. 111-12 The standard was later presented to King Afonso VI of Portugal himself. The Spanish casualties were very high, all of their artillery and baggage was captured, and the army was forced to retreat to Badajoz in Extremadura. The Spanish garrison of √âvora nearly 3,700 men was then besieged but they being abandoned, capitulated on 24 June without a single casualty being inflicted on the British brigade.Riley pp. 96-98 Engraving of the Battle of Montes Claros 1665 - the British brigade were crucial to the decisive victory. After more quarrels with the Portuguese high command to get supplies to his men, Schomberg and the British brigade pressed ahead in the next campaign. The following year the siege of Valencia de Alc√°ntara took place from 10 June. A fortnight later after a breach had been in the defences - the English who bore the brunt leading the main assault suffered heavy casualties but forced the surrender of the Spanish garrison. The Portuguese soon realized their mistake in the mistrust and sent heaps of praise upon Schomberg and the English. The Count of Castelo Melhor made a comment soon after the surrender of Valencia de Alcantara. On 17 June 1665 at the Battle of Montes Claros the brigade was crucial in the outcome.Riley pp. 122-23 The Portuguese under commander Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva positioned his heaviest infantry, composing the British brigade under Schomberg once more, in two lines in the most vulnerable area and ordered his artillery to support them. As the battle raged Schomberg had his horse shot from under him, and was nearly captured, but the veteran brigade were able break the defences to bring about a decisive victory over the Spaniards under Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena. After Montes Claros the Spaniards failed to gain any compensating advantage but the war continued and Portugal was safe from further attack. Over the next two years Schomberg and the depleted English brigade helped to lead a series of raids across the border. They captured the fortress of A Guarda and plundered Alburquerque until a ceasefire in 1667 was declared after a palace coup within the Portuguese court forced King Afonso VI of Portugal into exile. Aftermath A treaty had been signed by England and Spain at Madrid in 1667; in that treaty England agreed to mediate a treaty between Portugal and Spain or at least a thirty year truce.Davenport pp.98-99 In 1668, desperate to reduce its military commitments, at almost any price, Spain accepted the loss of the Crown of Portugal and formally recognized the sovereignty of the House of Braganza by signing the Treaty of Lisbon with the promised English mediation.Barton p. 139McMurdo pp 439 At the conclusion of peace and with the war over, the brigade was then broken up with 1,000 men remaining in total out of the 3,500 men who made up the force.Riley p. 165 The remainder returned to seek service in England or abroad - but places and positions were hard to find. About half of the men were incorporated in the Tangier garrison, and the remainder were shipped back to England. Some remained in Portugal having found wives or sought to join various trades.

These networks attempted to form in the late 1980s to 1990s. The more notable ones Radio AAHS and Radio Disney, while Children's Radio Network was the first on the air. Children's Radio Network Children's Radio Network was the first children's radio network which went to the air twice. Children's Radio Network started broadcasting from its flagship station in Jacksonville in 1984. It was founded and funded by William Osewalt. The network built up to six affiliated stations. Osewalt ran into some personal financial problems, forcing a shutdown of the network in 1986. Osewalt relaunched the network on WWTC in Minneapolis in May 1990 as Radio AAHS. As of May 1991, the network had no addition affiliates but expected to add some by the end of the year. Imagination Station Network Imagination Station Network, also called Kids' Choice Broadcasting Network, was a children's radio network. Most of the programming was music with the rest being stories, call-ins from children and radio host chatter. In 1988, Matt Leibowitz approached his friend Peter Yarrow about how a kid's radio network would be designed. They were initially joined by three other primary investors. Leibowitz became the network's chairman while Yarrow was appointed vice president for creative programming. Yarrow wrote and performed original music for the network, including the station's march song and theme songs for its seven daily program segments. He then moved into promoting the network and seeking investors. The network projected to have 100 affiliates at the end of its first year. WPRD station owner, Metroplex Communications, invested in the network. Kids' Choice Broadcasting Network started broadcasting in late March 1990 on WPRD, its originating and only station. The network changed its name to match the branded name of its originating station, Imagination Station Network. A second affiliate, KSCO in Santa Cruz, signed up by September 1990. 20 stations were expected to affiliate by the end of the first year. The network added another affiliate in Salt Lake City, KKDS, which was an affiliate to the network's first sign off. Audience-survey companies like Arbitron Ratings Co. rarely interview kids under age 12. With only two affiliates, the network did not attract national advertising, and thus lacked the funds to get more affiliates. Additional equity funding could not be found. On February 27, 1991, the Imagination Station Network stopped broadcasting. Metroplex withdrew as an investor from the network. However, KKDR continued using the Imagination Station format. Grassroots efforts began with kids offering the station, WPRD, their piggy bank money. Two six-year-old girls set up a fundraising booth on their front lawn. The founder and president of the Orlando-based National Association for the Rights of Children, Bob McCarthy, teamed up with the network's former programming executives to bring a new children's radio network to Orlando. Leibowitz was still receiving forwards entries for the network's kid's club. On April 1, 1991, a reorganized Imagination Station Network was launched by Leibowitz from WXJO-FM in St. Louis. Funding the relaunch network were the affiliates, WXJO and KKDS. WXJO used the moniker \\"Kids Radioi\\" until it signed off as the final network station, when the FCC stalled in given approval for a license, in late first quarter 1992. Kidwaves Radio Network Kidwaves Radio Network was founded in 1989 by Marcia Moon and her partners. They intended to launch Kidwaves when 20 stations had signed on as affiliates. Kidwaves announced a launch date of April 1990; this was delayed until August. It was then pushed back to the summer of 1991. The only known affiliate was a station owned by Ragan Henry in Kansas City. As of 1991, they were still looking for additional affiliates.

Her work has focused on Sufi mysticism, diasporas, Muslim women and public sector unions in Botswana. She has written extensively about the Arab Spring. Werbner is married to anthropologist Richard Werbner, and is the niece of Max Gluckman. On cultural hybridity Werbner has argued, with particular reference to the Satanic Verses affair and other global cultural conflicts, for the need to recognise the key distinction first coined by Bakhtin between intentional and organic hybridity, in order to understand the Muslim diasporic offence while avoiding futile debates about cultural reification. In relation to the ‚Äòfailure‚Äô of multiculturalism debate she advocates analysing multiculturalism from below, and not merely as a top-down policy. Since 2000, Werbner has studied the women's movement and the Manual Workers Union in Botswana. Her ethnography, which won an Honorable Mention in 2015 in the Elliot P. Skinner Award from the AAA Association of Africanist Anthropology, analyses the legal mobilisation and struggle for dignity and a living wage of manual public sector workers, both men and women, and traces the evolution of a rooted, working class identity and culture in Botswana, which is both local and cosmopolitan, through cultural performance. Her work highlights the vernacular, situated cosmopolitanism of rights activists, trade unionists and feminists in the global south, transnational labour migrants and Sufis. She rejects, however, optimistic views of transnationalism as effacing national boundaries, and argues for the need to recognise the illusion of simultaneity, disguising the ruptures that transnational movement engenders. On diaspora she argues that diasporas are internally heterogeneous, imaginatively constructed, transnational moral communities of co- responsibility. The materiality of diaspora is manifested both affectively and aesthetically, and its members are willing to mobilize politically and economically across borders in response to the sufferings of fellow diasporans or crises in the ‚Äòhome‚Äô country. Werbner is Professor Emerita at Keele University. Bibliography * Pilgrims of Love: The Anthropology of a Global Sufi Cult.

The structure is located in Lafayette County outside Willow Springs, Wisconsin It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In 1827 Daniel Morgan Parkinson left his home in Tennessee and brought his family to Galena. He and his sons tried lead-mining but didn't like it. The family ran an inn in Mineral Point, with his wife Rebecca \\"...a most excellent and popular landlady....\\" When the Black Hawk War broke out, Daniel and his son Peter served under Henry Dodge, including in the decisive Battle of Wisconsin Heights. During the war, the Parkinsons spent some time in the stockade of Fort Defiance, five miles southeast of Mineral Point. In 1832 Daniel bought 80 acres of land a half mile from the fort, on the Military Road from Mineral Point to Galena. In 1833 he began building his hotel and home there on the hilltop. This was very early, before Wisconsin was a state. This area was still part of Michigan Territory. Most structures built in the lead-mining region at the time were simple and functional. Parkinson instead built a two-story I-house - a style he knew from Tennessee - with walls of hand-hewn oak joined by mortise and tenon. It was clad in white oak clapboard, with a two-story front porch. The house was originally heated by limestone fireplaces. Inside, walls are lath and plaster, and mantels from the fireplaces remain. with Daniel Parkinson continued his public service after the war. He was elected a delegate to the territorial legislature in 1836 and again in 1840. In 1837 he was involved in incorporating the village of Mineral Point. In 1846 he represented Lafayette County at the first Constitutional Convention. In 1848 he served in the state of Wisconsin's first House of Representatives. He was one of faction that was against banks and paper money, because of bad experiences during the territorial period. In the 1850s he served on the Lafayette county board, representing Willow Springs. Before the hotel was complete, the road from Mineral Point to Galena shifted west, and in the 1840s it shifted further, so the hotel business faded, but the Parkinson family lived in the house and farmed. Parkinsons lived in the house until 1928. It was eventually abandoned and near demolition when in 1994 Dean Connors and the Lead Region Historic Trust moved it 800 feet to the north and stabilized it.

The high school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The annex was added to the historic designation in 2016. History The building was designed by Joliet, Illinois architect F.S. Allen, and built by contractor Eric Lund of Minneapolis. with The Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival structure was built for $104,460, and it reflects the flamboyant attitude of the community during a period of economic expansion. The exterior is composed of brownish-pink Lake Superior Sandstone. It features a large central bell tower that is flanked by two projecting pavilions that are capped by a stepped-gable roof, and turrets at the corners. Initially, this was a three-story building capped with a hipped roof. By 1911 the building had become too small. The north wing was completed in 1912 for $225,000, and it was designed to complement the original building. The stone was purposely smoked to match the older stone. The school received the name Central High School in 1924 when other schools were built. The building was expanded again in 1930 when the hipped roof was removed and the fourth floor was added. The whole interior of the building was also remodeled at that time. The final expansion was the brick annex that was built to the south of the main building.

The Russians, who had the navy of their Swedish opponents along with their Archipelago fleet trapped inside the Vyborg Bay, planned to attack the Swedish ships from different directions causing a decisive defeat on its navy before the wind would allow them to escape the trap. On the night of July 2‚Äì3 the attack was commenced by Karl Heinrich von Nassau-Siegen who, with his coastal fleet of 81 ships of various sizes, sailed to meet with the Swedes stationed at the eastern strait of Bj√∂rk√∂sund. The Swedes with three divisions of mostly gun sloops and yawls under Lieutenant colonel Klas Hjelmstierna with major Leijonankar and captain Scharff assisting in their divisions, had about 42 boats (14 in each division) under their command. The strait beside the island of Kantasari, from which the Russians had to attack through, was narrow and was met with fierce fire at 23:00 on July 2 by the Swedish vessels. The fighting continued until 04:00 on July 3, until the Swedish Lieutenant received orders to fall back to the main Swedish ships as the breakthrough from Vyborg Bay was about to begin. A squadron of Lieutenant colonel Stedingk consisting of turumas was initially left to cover their withdrawal, but as the Russians chose not to pursue, they as well went off to the main Swedish vessels. In the battle the Swedes lost only 3 killed and another 8 wounded. The Russians, on the other hand lost up to 400 men killed and wounded according to their own numbers provided by captives after the battle of Svensksund (mostly due to the narrow strait they had to attack through), as well as one frigate and one xebec another larger ship was also lost along with some smaller ones. The Swedes were successful in that they managed to hold off the Russian coastal fleet long enough for the preparations for the breakthrough to be set and so, on July 3, Gustav III of Sweden and his navy finally broke out, although with heavy losses.Nordisk Familjebok, Konversationslexikon och Realencyklopedi.

The nonprofit organization centers fundraising around selling bracelets bearing the names of imprisoned journalists. Eight of the journalists profiled were released, including the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian. Priest and the students used Indiegogo to fund the original bracelets. They surpassed their flexible goal of $30,000 by almost $1,500 within the time limit of the campaign. The organization's mission statement is: \\"Our mission is to advocate for and support imprisoned journalists overseas. If a journalist somewhere still wears a cuff, so will we.\\" The campaign was launched at the Newseum in 2015.  Dana Priest  A two-time Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post investigative reporter, Dana Priest covers national security and press freedom worldwide. At the university, Priest teaches two courses: National Security and Press Freedom Reporting, and The Impact of 9/11 on Journalism and Civic Life. The former is the course with which she began Press Uncuffed. At the beginning of the semester, each student was assigned to an imprisoned journalist somewhere in the world. Throughout the semester, the student investigated, researched and reported on the journalist. Many students were able to call, video chat, and send messages to their journalists. By the end of the semester, students completed a long-form article to be published in either Capital News Service or the Washington Post, where Priest works. One story published in the Post covered Zainab Khawaja in Bahrain. A story about Pakistan's famous television show host Hamid Mir was also published in the Post.  Bracelets  Clear bracelets depicting the names of imprisoned journalists along with the countries in which they are imprisoned are the main source of funding for Press Uncuffed. The organization sells them through their website, pressuncuffed.org, and through Investigative Reporters and Editors, a non- profit organization that works to improve investigative journalism worldwide.  Social Media and Coverage  The organization is active on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. The organization put together a video the first year detailing their work and goals. At the University of Maryland, the organization has received extensive coverage. The Writers' Bloc, a student publication, covered the organization's mission. The university's student newspaper, The Diamondback, covered the nonprofit's win of the Do Good Challenge.

A daughter house of Trois-Fontaines and of the lineage of Clairvaux, it was dedicated to Saints Nicholas and Mary (Notre-Dame). According to Leopold Janauschek, its order number was 194. It was founded at the site called \\"Vieux Montiers\\" (Old Monastery) by its first abbot, Eustache, around 1135. Originally a house of Augustinian canons, it adopted the Cistercian rule on 30 May 1144. The monastery was moved to its final location, where its ruins are still found, around 1155. Eustache was assisted by a co- abbot, Gervais, and together they greatly expanded the abbey's temporalities. Towards the end of the century, the abbey was embroiled in controversy over land with the lords of Possesse and Dampierre-en-Astenois, especially Lord Renard II of Dampierre.Theodore Evergates (ed.), Feudal Society in Medieval France: Documents from the County of Champagne (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), pp. 120‚Äì22.

The song came out of a conversation with British / Hungarian film producer Alexander Korda in a New York taxi cab in 1938. The Munich agreement had just depressed both men. Korda asked Berlin if he had written a war song yet, and a few blocks later Berlin came up with the tune and lyrics. It was first performed in London at the start of the war in 1939 before its American release, which caused a sensation at the time. Berlin used it in his 1940 musical Louisiana Purchase, in which it describes feelings of despair and hope during the American Great Depression, of the 1930s. Irene Bordoni performed the song on the opening night. In the film version of Louisiana Purchase in 1941, the song was performed by a black chorus. Recordings It was recorded by British artist Vera Lynn and promoted to lift spirits of British people during the darkest days of World War Two and the Blitz. Other UK versions in 1940 were by Al Bowlly (HMV BD-828) and Denny Dennis (with Jay Wilbur And His Orchestra). In the USA, several artists put out recordings including Frank Sinatra who recorded it with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra on April 23, 1940 (Victor 78: 26596). Mary Martin included the song on her album Mary Martin Sings for You (1949). Memorable chorus The song contains the following chorus by which it is popularly known. :It's a lovely day tomorrow :Tomorrow is a lovely day :Come and feast your tear dimmed eyes :On tomorrow's clear blue skies. :If today your heart is weary :If ev'ry little thing looks gray :Just forget your troubles and learn to say :Tomorrow is a lovely day.  In culture  The song's title was used as the title of a made-for-TV film of 1975 called It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow, which is a drama documentary examining the Bethnal Green Disaster of 1943 in which 173 people were killed in a panic rush at the entrance to a bomb shelter, as well as being used as the title of an episode of the 1973 documentary series The World at War dealing with the Burma campaign. In the 1986 Australian film Death of a Soldier, serial killer Eddie Leonski (portrayed by American actor Reb Brown) sings a portion of the song while being questioned by military police. \\"A Lovely Day Tomorrow\\" was an entirely different song released as a one-off single from band British Sea Power in 2004.

It was released in November 2015 on Soulection, following his critically acclaimed debut mixtape, The God Complex. The mixtape features guest appearances from Anderson Paak and Masego. The project's production was handled by Louie Lastic, Merg, Galimatias, McCallaman, Braeden Bailey, Medasin, Milo Mills, Demo-Tapped, Tom Misch, and Jordan Rakei. And After That, We Didn't Talk received widespread acclaim for its production and unique storytelling and spawned three singles: \\"Dance On Me\\", \\"Spectrum\\", and \\"Palm Trees\\". Background Shortly after the release and critical acclaim of his debut mixtape, The God Complex, Goldlink signed with LA record label Soulection and began working on his second mixtape. In 2015, Goldlink was selected as part of the 2015 XXL Freshman class, and it was announced that he would be working with acclaimed producer Rick Rubin. He later released the song \\"Spectrum\\" as the debut single for the mixtape. It was later revealed that Rick Rubin would be his mentor and executive producer for the album. Composition In an interview on Soulection Radio with DJ, host, and mixtape executive producer Joe Kay, GoldLink said that the mixtape is a concept album based around a breakup he suffered at the age of 16: he says it was due to neither of them truly knowing how to properly handle a relationship. He also noted that this breakup is what lead to the events that took place within The God Complex, calling it his \\"memoir or moment of clarity\\". He stated that the writing for some of the songs are inspired by either conversations or ex- relationships. The mixtape features personal reflections on themes such as love, coming of age, obsession, intimacy, regret, police brutality, substance abuse, racism, and parenthood. Just like his previous project, the mixtape incorporates a blended style of hip hop and electronic. With the help of numerous producers among the Soulection roster, he was able to additionally blend jazz fusion and neo soul into his trademark style. Critical reception The mixtape received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. Music review aggregate site Metacritic scored the project a 72. Pitchfork's Matthew Strauss gave the mixtape a 7.3, stating that \\"[Goldlink's] music works when every element blends together, and And After That, We Didn't Talk is most interesting when he shares only the most vital details from a moment.

The full spectrum of sound explored is even richer this time around.\\" Kevin Ritchie from NOW rated the mixtape an 80 and stated \\"Even with quick, dense and precisely rhythmic flows, his rapping is like verbal dancing.

Many rank tests have been proposed for the two-sample location-scale problem. Nearly all of them are Lepage-type tests, that is a combination of a location test and a scale test. The Cucconi test was first proposed by Odoardo Cucconi in 1968. The Cucconi test is not as familiar as other location-scale tests but it is of interest for several reasons. First, from a historical point of view, it was proposed some years before the Lepage test, the standard rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem. Secondly, as opposed to other location-scale tests, the Cucconi test is not a combination of location and scale tests. Thirdly, it compares favorably with Lepage type tests in terms of power and type-one error probability and very importantly it is easier to be computed because it requires only the ranks of one sample in the combined sample, whereas the other tests also require scores of various types as well as to permutationally estimate mean and variance of test statistics because their analytic formulae are not available. The Cucconi test is based on the following statistic: : \\\\text{CUC} = \\\\frac{U^2 + V^2 - 2\\\\rho UV}{2(1-\\\\rho^2)}. where \\\\text{U} is based on the standardized sum of squared ranks of the first sample elements in the pooled sample, and \\\\text{V} is based on the standardized sum of squared contrary-ranks of the first sample elements in the pooled sample. \\\\text{œÅ} is the correlation coefficient between \\\\text{U} and \\\\text{V}. The test statistic rejects for large values, a table of critical values is available. The p-value can be easily computed via permutations. The interest on this test has recently increased spanning applications in many different fields like hydrology, applied psychology and industrial quality control.

Each of these playing surfaces are to be chosen by the ensemble director. All other aspects of the work, including dynamics, rhythms, articulations, and, to an extent, tempo, are defined. Instrumentation IV is scored for nine different playing surfaces. These surfaces are not defined by the composer. The director of the ensemble performing this work will choose instrumentation that works best with each other for this piece. Analysis The time signature is 7/8, and one player has an ostinato eighth-note rhythm controlling all tempo and major dynamic changes. This piece uses rhythms, dynamics, and accents to build structure, and shows an exposition, rise, climax, and resolution using pyramids of voices. The rhythmic structure of IV is complex because each time a rhythm repeats, another rhythm crosses it, and continues to add crossed rhythms until the midway point of the section, where the cross rhythms uncross themselves and starts again. This pattern happens a total of six times. Performance time for this piece is about 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Performances The University of Maryland, Baltimore County Percussion Ensemble performed this piece with the following instrumentation as chosen by Professor Tom Goldstein: bongos; tam-tam; low-tom; high-tom; china cymbal; crash cymbal; timbale; snare drum; and wood block. Composition Published in 1936, IV was one of the first major works for percussion ensemble, and the only work published during Beyer's lifetime. It is unknown why Beyer chose the title \\"IV\\". Beyer's compositional style focuses on experimental music and American contemporary music, which includes new music, atonal music, music with chance operations, and music for percussion. Beyer emigrated from Germany to New York City at a time when interest in new music was starting to grow rapidly. Beyer surrounded herself with people such as Henry Cowell, John Cage, and Charles Seeger, and studied music composition with them. Cowell was an innovative composer, using abnormal playing techniques to create new sounds from instruments, and Beyer took Cowell's percussion class at The New School, where Cowell's influence may have been her starting point for creating music for percussion ensemble. Beyer is one of the first composers to focus on music for percussion ensemble, and popularized the concept of music for percussion ensemble with IV as well as other of her many later works for percussion.

Oertel (1862-1942) in Sarnath, India. The statue has been decisive in matching the reign of Kanishka with contemporary sculptural style, especially the type of similar sculptures from Mathura, as its bears a dated inscription in his name.Papers on the Date of Kani·π£ka, Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Brill Archive, 1969, p.271 This statue is in all probability a product of the art of Mathura, which was then transported to the Ganges region. Inscription The inscription on the Bodhisattva explains that it was dedicated by a \\"Brother\\" (Bhikshu) named Bala, in the \\"Year 3 of Kanishka\\". This allows to be a rather precise date on the sculptural style represented by the statue, as year 3 is thought to be approximately 123 CE. The inscription further states that Kanishka (who ruled from his capital in Mathura) had several satraps under his commands in order to rule his vast territory: the names of the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps Mahakshatrapa (\\"Great Satrap\\") Kharapallana and the Kshatrapa (\\"Satrap\\") Vanaspara are mentioned as satraps for the eastern territories of Kanishka's empire.

On the other hand, despite other known instances of Hellenistic influence on Indian art, very little if any such influence can be seen in this type of statue.

He is seen by the company as a progenitor of what became the Jebsen Group, a trading and manufacturing company co-founded in Hong Kong on 1 March 1895 by his son Jacob Jebsen (1870‚Äì1941). During the early 1870s, with his own business interests increasingly centred on Europe, he returned to the town of his birth which was by now in Germany. In his final years he turned to politics, becoming a local senator in 1883 and a member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") in 1890. Life =Family provenance and early years= Michael Jebsen was born into a Protestant family in Apenrade, a flourishing bilingual trading port in a sheltered location on the eastern side of Schleswig, still an independent duchy, but increasingly coveted by the rulers of adjacent Denmark and nearby Prussia. Jebsen's father was also called Michael Jebsen (1793‚Äì1863) and was also a ship's captain based in Apenrade, where the Jebsens had been prominent members of the shipping community since the early years of the eighteenth century. Michael Jebsen and his twin sister, Thilde Christine, were the youngest of their parents' children. As an adolescent Jebsen briefly undertook an apprenticeship as a sail maker, but there was never any doubt that he would go to sea. In 1851, when he was 16, he joined the crew of the Hamburg-based full-rigged ship \\"Georg Heinrich\\" as a ship's boy. Between 1851 and 1873 he was working at sea: fifteen of those years were spent as a ship's captain on long voyages. His years at sea were not entirely uninterrupted, however. After several trips to South America he disembarked at London and then returned home early in 1853 to attend a navigation school in Loit-Skovby run by a retired ship's captain called Peter Boysen. Jebsen already knew Boysen, who had commanded the \\"Georg Heinrich\\" when Jebsen was working his first voyage. It is on record that at the end of the three-month course he passed his exams in July \\"comfortably\\". =Seafarer and captain= After a brief further stint as a sailor, in 1854 Jebsen joined the Apenrade barque \\"Otto\\" as third mate. In 1856, still aged only 21, he was given his first command. His ship was the Peruvian barque \\"Joven Emilio\\", and he was its captain for two years. Between February 1859 and July 1860 he served as first officer on the ocean going steam ship \\"Antonius Varas\\". There followed a brief assignment as a captain in Valparaiso in Chile, before he returned to Europe, disembarking in Hamburg. Hamburg was part of the German Confederation whereas Schleswig, despite growing pressure from commercial interests, was not. In his linguistically divided home town of Apenrade the Jebsen family were part of the German-speaking community, and in an age of growing nationalist sentiment the cultural distinctions which might have gone unnoticed a few years earlier were gaining in practical significance. In 1861 Captain Michael Jebsen acquired Hamburg citizenship, one visible sign of which was that ships under his command were no longer required to fly the Dannebrog (Danish flag). Jebsen made his first visit to Hong Kong in 1864 while captaining the barque \\"Notos\\", owned by the Hamburg firm Hastedt & Co. There is a suggestion that around this time, identifying the competitive advantage that might be available from focusing on steam ships rather than on traditional sailing barques, he developed plans to found his own shipping company, which could help to revive the shipping industry in his home town, but these plans had to be postponed, partly because of geo-political developments, and during most of the 1860s he was working out of Hamburg. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71 inhibited trade along the route to Hong Kong, since French warships were blockading trade with China. =Family matters= In 1867, while on shore leave, he married Clara Anna Offermann (1844‚Äì1913), the daughter of a ship's captain. According to the New German Biographical Dictionary the marriage resulted in two sons and two daughters, but sources closer to the family state that there were four sons and four daughters, which may indicate that several of their children died in infancy. Clara accompanied her husband on his next few voyages, which he undertook as captain - and according to one source now also as the owner \\\\- of the barques \\"Ceyphrus\\" und \\"Galathea\\". It was not unusual for ships' captains to travel accompanied by their wives, despite the complications presented by the possibilities of pregnancy and childbirth. Clara gave birth to their son, Jacob, in December 1870, albeit on dry land, while they were docked at Port Townsend on the coast of what later became Washington state. Michael Jebsen's next lengthy stay ashore and at home in Apenrade, Schleswig having been administered by Prussia since 1864, and subsumed into it in 1866. That made Apenrade part of the new German state with effect from 1871. Early in 1873 Jebsen embarked on his final voyage as a ship's captain, in command of the Hamburg registered steam ship \\"Luxor\\". In October of that year he returned once more to Apenrade, at the age of 38 starting a new life, ashore, \\"for good\\". =Ship owner ashore= In 1874 Michael Jebsen took a job with the mega-magnate Alfred Krupp. His duties in charge of the shipping and forwarding business based in Vlissingen (later Rotterdam) meant moving with his family to the Netherlands for a few years. He continued to work for Krupp till 1882, despite handing in his notice (which at this stage was amicably declined) in 1878. Jebsen continued to nurture ambitions beyond his work for Krupp, and had set up his own company, \\"M. Jebsen\\" in 1874 in support of his intentions. In 1878 the company moved, with him, to Rotterdam. On 23 November 1878 he registered a new company in Rotterdam, \\"Partenreederei M. Jebsen\\", in connection with his purchase of a steam ship which quickly proved to be only the first of several such acquisitions. Jebsen continued to place faith in the prospects for trade with China, and shortly after he launched his shipping business the \\"Vorwaerts\\" was the first of his steam ships to arrive in Hong Kong, flying his company's flag which, like the crest of his home town, depicted three mackerel (identified in the Cantonese patois as \\"three-piecey-fish\\") flapping in the sea breeze. By 1897 there were no fewer than 14 steam-ships, and the focus of the business remained on the East Asian routes. =Politics= By 1883 Jebsen had been able to relocate back to Apenrade where he was elected a \\" senator\\" (member of the local council). In 1890 he was elected to the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") where he represented the Flensburg electoral district, sitting as a member of the National Liberal Party (\\" Nationalliberale Partei\\" / NLP). He was re-elected in 1893, but not in 1898. He was a member of several Reichstag committees, including those concerned with disease control, the slave trade, emigration, accident insurance and various aspects of shipping. In the chamber he argued strongly for naval expansion in order to protect the colonies, and was a member of the marine budget commission. In some quarters he became known affectionately (if inaccurately) as \\"The Admiral\\". In 1898 he was elected a member of the lower chamber of the Prussian parliament (Landtag). =Bismarck memorial= Although Apenrade and the commercially vibrant area around it were predominantly German speaking, the northern part of Schleswig taken as a whole was predominantly rural and Danish speaking. German speakers in north Schleswig were a minority. This would be demonstrated in 1920 when plebiscites were held as a result of which north Schleswig was transferred to Denmark (while south Schlesig remains part of Germany). During the 1890s, following the chancellor's reluctant resignation, there was a great surge in the construction of Bismarck monuments. This resonated particularly strongly with the German-speaking minority in North Schleswig. Michael Jebsen took a lead in the campaign to fund and construct an appropriate meeting place for the German speakers on the Knivsberg projection a couple of kilometers inland, to the north of Apenrade. Jebsen was a co-founder of the Knivsberg Society set up in 1893, and he was its first chairman, launching the fund raising with his own 10,000 Mark donation. His special focus was on the erection of a Bismarck memorial tower at the highest point of the outcrop, and the foundation stone of the construction was duly set in place in 1895. However, Michael Jebsen was no longer available to preside at the dedication of the memorial, which was instead undertaken, in 1901, in the presence of his son. =Death= During the late summer of 1899, while visiting a spa resort, Michael Jebsen was taken ill. He was transferred to Berlin where he underwent an operation and, on 30 September, died. Two months later, in a ceremony that was very much quieter than must have been envisaged on 28 May 1899 when he couple announced their engagement, his daughter Johanne married her cousin, Heinrich Jessen, consolidating family connections that underpinned the Hong Kong-based Jebsen Group.

MAG is on the lower right of this graphic Magnetometer (MAG) is the name of an instrument suite on the Juno orbiter for planet Jupiter. The MAG instrument includes both the Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) and Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC) instruments. There two sets of MAG instrument suites, and they are both positioned on the far end of three solar panel array booms. Each MAG instrument suite observes the same swath of Jupiter, and by having two sets of instruments, determining what signal is from the planet and what is from spacecraft is supported. Avoiding signals from the spacecraft is another reason MAG is placed at the end of the solar panel boom, about 10 m (33 feet) and 12 m (39 feet) away from the central body of the Juno spacecraft. The MAG instrument is designed to detect the magnetic field of Jupiter, which is one of the largest structures in the Solar System. If one could see Jupiter's magnetic field from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away. Jupiter's internal magnetic field prevents the solar wind, a stream of ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts it away from the planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma different from that of the solar wind. Mission goals: * map the magnetic field of Jupiter * determine the dynamics of Jupiter's interior * determine the three-dimensional structure of the polar magnetosphere and its auroras. Jupiter has the strongest and biggest magnetic fields known to exist in the solar system. Studying these fields is one of the goals of the Juno mission, and in particular the task rests on the Magnetometer instruments. MAG measures the field about 60 times per second, and records the direction and strength of the field. MAG collected data on Earth during its 9 October 2013 flyby en route to Jupiter (this was a gravity assist maneuver, but also was to collect data). Another advantage to studying Jupiter's field is that on Earth, crustal magnetism interferes with measurements of the field generated deep in the core, partially shielding it from measurements. On Earth the field is generated by spinning liquid iron, whereas on Jupiter is generated by hydrogen. Jupiter is mostly hydrogen (about 90%), and as it compresses from gravity it turns conductive in a special form. However, it is not known if farther in where it should compress to metallic hydrogen, if that is conducting electricity also. That is one of the questions Juno may answer. In addition to studying Jupiter, the MAG also returned data on the Earth's magnetosphere. The MAG instrument was delivered to Lockheed Martin Space Systems' facility in Denver, Colorado, USA for integration into the Juno spacecraft by NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center (GFSC) in October 2010. MAG was overall designed and built at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Advanced Stellar Compass was built and contributed by the Technical University of Denmark. (Technical University of Denmark, or in Danish () commonly known as DTU) The FGM and ASC were turned on in late August after Junos launch on 5 August 2011. The ASC allow a very precise determination of the magnetometers orientation in space. They are star trackers that take a picture of the sky, then compare those images to a catalog of star maps to allow the orientation to be determined. The fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) is similar to previous instruments flown on spacecraft like the Voyagers, Magsat, Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers, Mars Global Surveyor, etc. This style of FGM uses twin wide-range, triaxial flux gate sensors mounted far away from the spacecraft body in which the magnetic flux is periodically switched (hence the ame flux-gate). Two FGM's are used so the separate readings can be combined to make the magnetic field calculation. MAG has two vector fluxgate magnetometers supported by advanced star trackers. The star tracking system allows the orientation of the FGM to be calculated and determined more accurately enhancing the usefulness of the FGM readings. Jupiter's magnetic fields were previously observed in the 1970s with Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. Magnetometers related to Juno include ones on MAVEN, MGS, Voyager, AMPTE, GIOTTO, CLUSTER, Lunar Prospector, MESSENGER, STEREO, and Van Allen Probes. At one point, JPL was working on including a Scalar Helium Magnetometer on Juno, in addition to the FGM and ASC suite. Results and papers In 2017, a paper called The analysis of initial Juno magnetometer data using a sparse magnetic field representation included analysis of data from the Juno magnetometer which passed 10 times closer that previous probings. The nature of Jupiter's magnetic field was examined combining the latest results from MAG with a mathematical model called VIP4 spherical harmonic model for the magnetic field of Jupiter.

It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when Pedro Cabral discovered Brazil in 1500. Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil. In the 18th century, during the time of the Empire, Brazil followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical, Baroque, and Gothic Revival architecture. Then, in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with Modernist architecture. The modernist approach was named as minimalism without the need for excessive frills or decoration. Instead, the architecture became more simplistic, with clean lines and a functional form. This style became more popular around the end of World War II, when function was more important than form. During this time, Oscar Niemeyer, who became and remains one of the world's greatest modernists, began to present a style that was to become Brazil's very own style.  Portuguese colonial architecture in the 16th century  Portuguese colonial architecture, Salvador. The colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese, who created an architecture familiar to them in Europe. They built sacred and secular buildings, including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside. They founded Recife, S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador in the colonial period; these cities saw the best expression of Brazilian architecture. Buildings of this period were distinct because they followed similar rules such as: * symmetry * box-like structure * alcoves and recessed windows * constructed from stone and mortar * covered with plaster for a smooth finish The best examples are in the city of Salvador, with its multi- colored colonial buildings that outline the streets and depict Salvador's history. = Salvador = Founded in the 1500s, Salvador is one of the oldest cities in Brazil and home to impressive colonial and baroque styles. The city became Brazil's first capital until 1763 and home to spectacular colonial and baroque styles. After defeating the Dutch in the 17th century, Portuguese settlers built and refurbished several forts along the Bay including S√£o Marcelo Fort. The port stands perfectly round on a small reef bank about 1000 feet off the coast. A Brazilian writer, Jorge Amado, explained it as the ‚ÄúBelly button of Bahia‚Äù. Another example of great architecture in Salvador is the Lacerda Elevator which also became the most well-known piece of architecture in Salvador. Built around 1872, the structure linked both upper and lower cities with four elevators, with air conditioning, offering stunning views of the bay. Furthermore, the city shelters numerous buildings with meaningful cultural and historical significance.  18th-19th century Brazilian architecture  Municipal Theatre of S√£o Paulo shows Neoclassical architecture in Brazil. Between the 18th and 19th Century Brazilian architecture is a period that saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Baroque architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture. = Baroque = The best examples of Baroque architecture in Brazil are found in the city of Ouro Preto where buildings start to take more ornate forms and rounded corners. Certain structures also depict painting which are incorporated into the walls. In 1980, Unesco declared the city a ‚Äúworld monument‚Äù with 13 churches, 11 chapels, major museums, ancient bridges, and well-preserved houses. The best preserved residence is the Casa dos Contos, built in 1780. A beige and white three-story building with a stone watering trough for horses in the back yard as well as dark flagstone cubicles where slaves lived. Today the structure is served as the office of the city's postal authorities while depicting the city's history and simplistic styles. = Neoclassicism = Neoclassicism refers back to ancient Rome and Greece by adopting their large multi story columns and grand triangular roofs. The liberal use of white soapstone, limestone, or marble are also indicators of Neoclassical buildings. Great examples lay in the city of Manaus, specifically the Theatro Amazonas . By the turn of the 20th century, the Amazonian region of Brazil began to prosper. The increasing amounts of money from exports from its rubber plantations region flourished particularly the capital city of Manaus. Wealthy rubber barons tried to recreate lavish lifestyle of European elites. In order to do so, an Opera House, the Teatro Amazonas, was built in the middle of the rainforest. The construction began in 1884 under the supervision of an Italian Architect. The roofing came from Alsace, the furniture from Paris, marble from Italy and the steel from England. The entire dome is wonderfully covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the Brazilian national flag: Blue, yellow, and green.  20th century Brazilian architecture  Brasilia National Congress, an example of Modernist architecture. In the 1950s Brazil decided to found a new capital city in the interior of Brazil to help develop Brazil's interior. The city was Bras√≠lia and it would see a great experiment in modernist architecture. Government buildings, churches and civic buildings would be constructed in the modernist style. Throughout the modern age, Brazil began to define itself as a county in its architecture. This was done so with the help of Brazil's most famous architect and designer, Oscar Niemeyer. He designed the Edificio Copan in S√£o Paulo, one of Brazil's biggest cities, and the entire city of Brasilia. His buildings were characterized by the use of concrete and free-flowing curves. = Oscar Niemeyer = Oscar Niemeyer in 1958 As a young man, Niemeyer worked for his father as a typographer before entering the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. After his graduation, Niemeyer went off to work for L√∫cio Costa, who was an architect from the Modernist school. In 1941, Niemeyer launched his solo career by designing multiple buildings called the Pampulha Architectural Complex in the city of Belo Horizonte. This was when Niemeyer began developing some of his well-known design trademarks such as the heavy uses of solid and an inclination towards curves. Niemeyer stated: \\"I consciously ignored the highly praised right angle and the rational architecture of T-squares and triangles, in order to wholeheartedly enter the world of curves and new shapes made possible by the introduction of concrete into the building process\\". Interesting enough, Niemeyer was introduced in the Brazilian Communist Party during his youth years and officially joined in 1945. This became an issue for him in 1964 as the Brazilian military removed the government and viewed Niemeyer as a dangerous individual, thus ransacking his office as well. Shocked, he decided to leave the country for good and move to France, furthering his career and designs there. Nevertheless, Niemeyer redefined architecture in Brazil by leaning away from old and European-influenced styles and creating new and aesthetic designs instead. Particularly in cities such as Bras√≠lia, where he obtain a structural solution that would distinct the city's architecture. In order to do so, he made the structures very different, where the columns became more narrow at a point where the structures would seem to barely touch the ground. As a result, Niemeyer remains one of the most well-known architects in Brazil as his structures are visited by many worldwide. = Presidential Palace (Pal√°cio da Alvorada) = One of Niemeyer's greatest successes was the Pal√°cio da Alvorada in Bras√≠lia. A two-story glass and concrete structure with curved supports forming the fa√ßade on all of the four walls. These walls are stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass. The nave is entered by an impressive subterranean passage rather than a conventional doorway. Thus, the Presidential Palace, along with many other of Oscar's designs drew attention to the architecture in Brazil and created a modern style for Brazil as well.

At the time, he was a cavalry captain in Hans Joachim von Zieten's Hussar regiment. He became the head of gendarmes regiment, and inspector general of the cavalry of Brandenburg March and Magdeburg in 1775. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1785 and general of cavalry in 1788. Frederick awarded him the Order Pour le M√©rite and the Order of the Black Eagle. In 1851, Prittwitz was included on the panels of the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great as one of the key figures in the establishment of the Prussia state. Family Prittwitz was born in Gro√ü L√§switz. He came from the old and established Silesian nobility of Prittwitz, and was the son of the Prussian military captain and landowner Joachim Wilhelm von Prittwitz (13 March 1693-5 June 1758), master of Gro√ü L√§switz, and Sophie Wilhelmine Gottesliebe von Domnig (9 February 1698-28 October 1752). He was born on 3 February 1726, on his father's estate.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Adelige H√§user A Band VI, Seite 321, Band 29 der Gesamtreihe, C. A. Starke Verlag, Limburg (Lahn) 1962, . As a 36-year-old on 16 December 1762 in Berlin, he married the widowed Eleanor of Paczensky and Tenczin, born Freiin von Seherr-Tho√ü (12 January 1739 on the estate at Sch√∂nfeld, Kr. Schweidnitz, Lower Silesia, died 23 February 1799 in Berlin), the daughter of the Junker Karl Heinrich von Seherr-Thoss, lord on the estates Sch√∂nfeld and Ludwigsdorf, and the Anna Elisabeth von Zedlitz and Leipe. Eleonore, a wealthy heiress, brought to the marriage fourteen properties in Lower Silesia near Breslau and Hirschberg.Robert von Prittwitz und GaffronRobert von Prittwitz: Das v. Prittwitz'sche Adelsgeschlecht. Verlag Wilhelm Gottl. Korn, Breslau 1870, Seite 230 f. Properties included Peterwitz, Kr. Strehlen, Pollogwitz, and Gro√ü- und Klein-S√§gewitz, all in county of Breslau, Sch√∂nfeld, Ludwigsdorf, Schwenkfeld, Esdorf and Erlicht Kupferberg and Buchwald near Schmiedeberg, both in the region of Hirschberg. Before that, she had been married to Hans Adam von Paczensky and Tenczin (1700-1761), lord of Gro√ü-und Klein-S√§gewitz and Peterwitz. Children included: Charlotte Eleonore (1763‚Äì1827) married Friedrich Detlef von Moltke ( 28 August 1750-2 September 1825); Friedrich Wilhelm Bernhard (11 December 1764-2 October 1843), finance minister married Charlotte Friederike von Bernard (1767‚Äì1815); Karl Heinrich (5 February 1766-9 June 1826) married Countess Friederike von Blankensee (12 July 1783-17 December 1856). Military career Prittwitz first attended a village school, later to the Oelser Gymnasium. In August 1741, he entered the Prussian cadet corps in Berlin, and in November of that same year was accepted as a Fahnenjunker (cadet) in Dragoon Regiment Nr. 1 (von Posadowski). From here, Prittwitz's military career modeled that of other Junker sons.William W. Hagen, Ordinary Prussians ‚Äì Brandenburg Junkers and Villagers, 1500‚Äì1840 (Cambridge University Press, 2007) In the War of Austrian Succession, Prittwitz remained with Dragoon Regiment Nr. 4 and participated in all the major battles: in particular, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg on 7 June 1745. On 4 April 1746, he was promoted to the F√§hnrich and was stationed in garrison in Schwedt. On 8 May 1751, he became a second lieutenant. During the Seven Years' War, he was at the Battle of Kolin on 18 June 1757 and the Battle of Zorndorf on 25 August 1758, after which he was honored with the Order Pour le M√©rite. Short of cash, though, in 1758 he asked his king for money in a long poem, and he answered: \\"Wer dieses so artig in Verse gebracht, dem werden 500 Dukaten vermacht. ‚Äì Ich bin Euer wohlaffectionirter K√∂nig Friedrich.\\" (He who has expressed himself so well in this verse will be left with 500 ducats. I am your well-disposed King Frederick.\\" At the end of 1758, the King instructed General Hans Joachim von Zieten to select the best officers for his Hussars from the whole army, and he selected Prittwitz as first lieutenant. On the 12 August 1759, Prittwitz, then thirty-three years old, was promoted to the Rittmeister (cavalry captain). At a critical point in Battle of Kunersdorf, he saw Frederick standing on a small hill with the remnants of his body-guard‚Äîthe Leib Cuirassier‚Äîdetermined to either hold the line or to die trying. With a 100-strong Hussar squadron, Rittmeister Prittwitz cut his way through the Cossacks and dragged the King to safety.Scott Stephenson (Lt. Col, USArmy), Old Fritz Stumbles: Frederick the Great at Kunersdorf, 1759. Studies in Battle Command.

Prittwitz was promoted to major on 10 December 1760 and received the command of the 1st Battalion of his regiment. In 1761, Prittwitz was often working for the king personally. He was promoted to the lieutenant colonel in 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War, which he had begun as a lieutenant, and soon became commander of the Hussars' regiment. Upon the death of Charles Frederick Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt without heirs in 1762, his estate reverted to the crown. After the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Frederick II granted these fortunes to the two officers toward whom he had particular gratitude: Lieutenant Colonel Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz, who had proven instrumental at the Battle of Torgau,Theodor Fontane: Frau von Friedland.

Gotthard Erler, Rudolf Mingau (Hrsg.), Aufbau-Verlag, Berlin 1997, p. 172‚Äì174. received the estate of Friedland, and Prittwitz, who had led the King from the battlefield at Kunersdorf, received the estate at Quilitz (present-day Kwielice). Theodor Fontane gave this circumstance a special mention, by quoting a proverb: \\"Lestwitz a sauv√© l'etat, Prittwitz a sauv√© le roi.\\" (Lestwitz saved the state, Prittwitz saved the king.\\")Heinrich Kaak, Korporative Gutsherrschaft und Agrarinnovationen in Preussen, BWV Verlag, 2012 , p.182 cf In the years after 1763, Prittwitz carried out special assignments for the King: in 1765, he investigated the suitability of a proposed canal for shipping, and in 1767, he examined irregularities in the casting of Berlin coin. On 12 December 1768 he was appointed colonel. On 20 May 1775, he became major general and commander of the \\"Regiment Gendarmes\\" in Berlin and Inspector General of the Cavalry of Brandenburg and Magdeburg. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Promotions * Fahnrich: August 1741 * Cadet: 4 April 1746 * Second Lieutenant Dragoon Regiment No. 1: 8 May 1751 * First Lieutenant: 1758 * Captain (Rittmeister): 12 August 1759 * Major: 10 December 1760 * Lt Colonel: 1763 * Colonel: 12 December 1768 * Major General: 20 May 1775 * Lieutenant General: 20 May 1785 * Inspector General of Cavalry: 20 May 1789 } In 1778, during the War of Bavarian Succession, Prittwitz commanded a brigade on the Prussian right wing, consisting of 13 squadrons.

This beetle has been introduced into Northern Australia as a biological control agent in an attempt to control its host plants, which are invasive weeds there.  Distribution  Calligrapha pantherina, Bourail, New Caledonia, 2020 In its native Mexico, this beetle is only found in the states of Guerrero, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Chiapas. In 1989, after extensive assessment, it was released into Northern Territory Australia. Following its success in that country, it was released in 1999 into Papua New Guinea, and also later into Fiji and Vanuatu. In 2016, the beetle was found to have reached New Caledonia. This caused some concern because, although there is invasive Sida acuta on the island, there are also two endemic species of Sida. Ecology Sida acuta is a small shrub that is native to Mexico but has spread to many other tropical countries. In its native land, Calligrapha pantherina has a restricted host range and feeds only on Sida acuta and the closely related Sida rhombifolia and Sida spinosa. Eggs are laid on the underside of older leaves. The larvae feed on the foliage, aggregating together for the first three instar stages and feeding separately during the fourth (last) instar. The larger larvae may also consume the flowers and fruits. When fully fed, the larvae descend to the ground, pupating among the leaf litter or buried in fine soil.

They were mostly built in the Mukden arsenal in Manchukuo. History The factory established in Shenyang (later known as Mukden) began producing the rifle around 1924. This date is believed to be the origin of the designation \\"Type 13\\" as the Nationalist Chinese calendar begins in 1911. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, rifles continued to be produced in the newly created puppet state of Manchukuo, until the factory switched over to producing Arisaka rifles in 1938. It is estimated that around 140,000 Type 13 rifles were made in total. Most of the weapons are using the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge, but some have turned up chambered in 6.5√ó50mmSR Arisaka, probably during the period of Japanese control through Manchukuo. The rifles were originally used by the soldiers of Zhang Zuolin (who established the factory and the production of the rifle) in various battles during the warlord era. 72,679 rifles of this type were captured by the Japanese after the Mukden Incident in 1931. The Manchukuo Imperial Army then began using these rifles, as well as newly produced ones, although by the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War the number of rifles in service is estimated to have been fairly small, most likely due to the standardization program and shift towards Japanese weapons during the 1930s. The collaborationist Inner Mongolian Army of Prince Demchugdongrub, and the later puppet state of Mengjiang, had 10,000 of these rifles as well, received in 1929. Design detail =Arisaka characteristics= The rifle shared many features with the Arisaka rifle, such as a two-part stock, an ovoid bolt handle, and double-gas escape ports on the receiver. It also had a sliding bolt cover that attached to the bolt, and was removable. Another similarity it had with the Arisaka was the bolt being bored from the rear, in order to allow room for a mainspring, which was fixed in by the use of a large housing. =Mauser characteristics= The symbol of Mukden arsenal The rifle's safety is similar to that of the Mauser 1898; however, instead of being threaded, the bolt sleeve is fixed to the bolt by way of lugs. The rifle has a pistol grip stock, but with no grasping grooves. Its upper handguard runs from the receiver ring to the lower band. The upper and lower bands are both thinner than on a Mauser, and there is a parade hook for the upper band. The nose cap of the rifle has a short H bayonet lug, so only a bayonet with a muzzle ring can be fitted to it. The lower barrel band has a swivel, and there is a quick-release sling fitting behind the stock's pistol grip. =Specifications= The rifle was built to be long, with the barrel making up of that, to weigh . It was designed to be a bolt action rifle with a 5-round box magazine, and have a tangent leaf rear sight that was graduated to . It was made mostly to fire 7.92x57mm (Mauser) bullets; however, some were modified to hold 6.5x50mm (Arisaka) bullets, those that were modified to fire 6.5x50mm bullets were given an auxiliary block in the back of the magazine well in order to compensate for the size difference of the cartridges. The rifle had a left handed 4-groove rifling. The top of the receiver ring was marked with the symbol of the Mukden arsenal, and the serial number of the gun was placed on the left side of the receiver ring.

Early life  Judith Palmer grew up in rural Ohio. Her mother used to say she \\"came out of the womb singing.\\" The local, public school system, exposed her to musical instrument lessons, and singing opportunities. Her first composition, in 1963, was ‚ÄúThe Class Song.‚Äù It was conducted by Judith and sung at high school graduation by all 32 members of her graduating class.  Wine, Women and Song  In 1970, Judith helped start the feminist singing group Wine, Women and Song. The motivation for starting the group was to make up for the dearth of women-composed, women-centered music, and to create music for a day-long radio program of original feminist music for International Women's Day. Judith's first arrangement for this program was \\"Free of the Burden\\", to the tune of \\"Get Along Home Cindy, Cindy\\". In 1975, Cathy Roma recruited singers from Wine, Women and Song to form Anna Crusis Women's Choir.  Anna Crusis Women's Choir  Judith is a founding member of Anna Crusis Women's Choir. Since 1975, she has sung in the first soprano section and has served as choir arranger and composer, particularly of four- and five- part acappella pieces written for small ensembles. ANNA‚Äôs mission to foster social change and advance the empowerment of women provided a venue for the musical expression of Judith's social commentary.

The current mainstream view outside of Estonia does not usually include it among them. Categorizing Estonia as a Nordic country is common in Estonia. A push towards being defined as a Nordic country has existed in independent Estonia since the war of independence in 1918. The Scandinavian connection from the Estonian Viking Age and later from being a part of the Danish and Swedish Empires left a lasting influence on the creation of the Estonian identity during the national awakening. Public attitudes 53.3% of ethnically Estonian youth consider belonging in the Nordic identity group as important or very important for them. 52.2% have the same attitude towards the \\"Baltic\\" identity group, according to a research study from 2013. Sociologist Mikko Lagerspetz has observed that the attitudes towards the Nordic identity in the Estonian society can be grouped in three: 1) Estonia is already a Nordic country; 2) Estonia needs to become a Nordic country but is not there yet; 3) Estonia should walk its own unique path. Modern political narrative An important element in Estonia's post-independence reorientation has been closer ties with the Nordic countries, especially Finland and Sweden. In December 1999, then Estonian foreign minister (and President of Estonia from 2006 until 2016) Toomas Hendrik Ilves delivered a speech entitled \\"Estonia as a Nordic Country\\" to the Swedish Institute for International Affairs. In 2003, the foreign ministry also hosted an exhibit called \\"Estonia: Nordic with a Twist\\". In 2015, the Estonian prime minister Taavi R√µivas defined the country's narrative as a \\"New Nordic Country\\", or \\"Uus P√µhjamaa\\". A conference comprising the heads of the coalition government was held in September 2016, discussing Estonia's outlook as a Nordic country. Kersti Kaljulaid, president of Estonia since 2016, commented on views of then Estonian foreign minister Ilves, saying that she does not want to use \\"loaded words\\" like Nordic or Baltic but prefers to call like-minded countries of northern Europe the \\"Nordic Benelux\\". The Nordic narrative is also communicated by government agencies: * Invest in Estonia ‚Äì The national investment agency * Brand Estonia * RMK ‚Äì The national forestry organization * Enterprise Estonia * The Foreign Ministry When state- owned Estonian flag carrier was renamed as Nordica in 2016, Erik Sakkov, then board member of the company, explained the airline's naming (according to some Estonian media outlets) with Estonia's continual self-identification among Nordic countries (P√µhjamaad in Estonian) and with country's leaders wish to emphasize it in the name of the national carrier.Nordic Aviation Groupi uueks nimeks saab Nordica. Eesti Ekspress, 8 March 2016Eesti lennufirma saab uue nime, √Ñrip√§ev, 8 March 2016 However, similar explanation by Sakkov which was published on Nordica homepage in English, claimed that motivation behind naming was Estonia's alignment with \\"Northern Europe\\" and country's leaders wish to reflect that.Nordica - the story behind the new name of the airline The Swedish ambassador to Estonia, Mr. Anders Ljunggren, has claimed in 2015 that Estonia would have been considered a Nordic country by the other Nordic countries, \\"had the history been different...The differences between Estonia and Sweden have become less year by year, owing to the fact that the two countries have gotten to know each other more each year\\". Criticism The Tuglas foundation has claimed that the Nordic definition that Estonia is moving towards does not exist anymore, being a relic of past times. Per H√∂gselius wrote an opinion piece about the topic in 2003, looking at the idea as fringe, but concluding that \\"in time the Estonians might be able to persuade us\\".

The hospital treated thousands of patients in need, became the center for the Medical Missionary Society in China, and still exists today as one of the most prestigious ophthalmic institutes in the world. Background Information = Canton = Canton Hospital's publication in 1920 Canton, now Guangzhou, was the center of foreign and international trade in China during the period of the late Qing dynasty. Canton was the only city in China where foreigners were allowed to set foot, thereby making it the only place where European and Chinese merchants could trade. Its location next to the Pearl River also made it ideal for international trade, as all ships used for trade were forced to travel along this river in order to arrive at the Port of Canton.\\"History of Canton China  Canton China Virtual Museum.\\" History of Canton China  Canton China Virtual Museum. Canton China Virtual Museum, n.d. Web. 16 Dec. 2016. Additionally, it was a major stop along the Silk Road, and is still a major port and city for transportation today. Canton was also surrounded by a major wall, which isolated it from the rest of the general population. Overall, because Canton was the only city in China that was open to foreign trade, medical mission work was made possible here and spread more easily. Portrait of Dr. Peter Parker = Dr. Peter Parker= Peter Parker was an American Protestant medical missionary. Before travelling to China, he attended Yale University for postgraduate work in theology and medicine. However, his main goal in travelling to China was not to practice medicine; instead, it was to save the Chinese from idol-worshipping and introduce them to Protestantism and Christianity. He first began work in the hospital by treating diseases in the eye because he was told it would be the fastest way to gain the trust of the Chinese. Because many of the natives regarded all foreigners as barbarians, it was important for Parker to gain the natives' trust in order to perform medicine on them and introduce them to Christianity. Eventually, Parker found so much joy in treating patients that he ultimately committed himself to becoming a full-time doctor, instead of a part-time evangelist and part-time doctor like he had originally planned.Snyder, Charles. \\"7 Green Pea Street.\\" Archives of Ophthalmology 75.6 (1966): 887. Web. During his twenty years of work in China, Parker treated over 50,000 patients. In the later years of his life, he became a fervent promoter of medical missions and played an instrumental role in increasing their importance and popularity. History of the Hospital On November 4, 1835, Peter Parker opened the Canton Hospital, which was the first Western-style hospital in China.Grundmann, C. H. (2005). Sent to heal!: Emergence and developmemt of medical missions. Lanham: University Press of America.Stevens, George Barker. Markwick, William Fisher. The life, letters, and journals of the Rev and Hon Peter Parker. [1896] digitized 2009. pg 118. Parker, the first full-time Protestant medical missionary, opened the hospital in connection with the mission of the American Board after Dr. Thomas Richardson Colledge, a Christian surgeon of the East India Company, convinced existing Protestant mission societies of the need for a hospital in China. Colledge strongly believed that Christians were required to help the sick in China, and as a result, pushed Parker, his mentee, to open a hospital in Canton. Under the support of the American Board and Canton businessmen, the hospital was the first and most famous charitable missionary hospital in South China at the time. When Parker opened the hospital, it was first only intended for the treatment of eye illnesses and was opened as an ‚ÄúEye Infirmary.‚Äù This helped Parker gain trust with the Chinese, but it was also practical because of patients' needs at the time. In many areas, Chinese medicine was not extremely far behind western medicine, but because they were not as advanced in eye medicine, there was a high prevalence of eye diseases during this time. Throughout the first three months of the hospital being open, 1061 patients were treated, and 96.1% of those had ocular illnesses.Chan, C. (2011). The First Western-Style Hospital in China. Archives of Ophthalmology, 129(6), 791. doi:10.1001/archophthalmol.2011.120 The hospital quickly proved to be very successful, and after the first year, 2,910 patients were treated. Soon after the hospital opened, Parker was asked to treat ear illnesses in addition to eye illnesses. This led to him finding a number of patients with tumors, and he was forced to perform surgery on these patients, which were almost always successful. As soon as others heard of Parker‚Äôs success, patients with all different types of illnesses and diseases wanted to come to the hospital for treatment. As a result, Parker soon found it impractical for the hospital to only treat eye illnesses, and it then opened up to all different types of diseases. Eventually, the hospital became so well known and in demand that it had to turn away patients because it became too much for only one physician. The hospital‚Äôs Chinese name, Pok Tsai, means Universal Helpfulness, which shows that everyone knew that the hospital would serve all classes in the community, Chinese and foreign.Âº†ÊñØ. \\"Canton hospital: the first Western hospital in China_Guangdong News_www.newsgd.com.\\" Canton hospital: the first Western hospital in China_Guangdong News_www.newsgd.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 Dec. 2016. In order to stay open, Parker depended on support from missionary colleagues and local business firms and merchants (especially Chinese merchant How-Qua). Because he didn‚Äôt charge for his services, he relied on their money to stay open. In addition, this hospital also led to Western-style medical education in China, when Parker and Dr. E.C. Bridgman trained three young Chinese men to help out in the hospital. However, it was not until 1866 that the first western-style medical school, the Boji Medical School, was established in the hospital. This medical school was run by missionaries, and is now part of the Sun-yatsen University of Medical Sciences.Deng, Y. Z. \\"Development of Medical Education in China.\\" Academic Medicine 65.8 (1990): 512-4. Web. In 1840, the First Opium War led to hostilities between England and China. During the war, the port of Canton was blockaded and all foreigners were forced to leave, causing the Canton Hospital to be temporarily shut down. Near the end of the war, China was forced to accept treaties that required them to open their borders to foreigners. As a result, missionaries were now allowed to do work in all of China (not only in Canton like before the war). In 1842, Parker returned to Canton with his wife, Harriet Webster (who was the first Western woman to be granted residence in China), and reopened the hospital.\\"Parker, Peter (1804-1888).\\" Parker, Peter (1804-1888)  History of Missiology.

Functions of the Hospital The hospital‚Äôs main goals included the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, the distribution of free vaccines, and plague treatments. Because the hospital was built by Parker in conjunction with other Protestant medical missionaries, philanthropic-minded physicians were very prominent at the hospital. As a result, it was also involved in areas outside of the treatment of diseases, including medical education, research, social service work, and promoting public health to the surrounding community. It cooperated with the Chinese government and many social organizations to develop school health, maternal and child health, and communicable disease control. The hospital was also built on a three-level medical system, which provided a model for the establishment of the Chinese rural medical system. Legacy The Canton Hospital is one of the most influential missionary hospitals in South China. Not only was it the first hospital that brought the concept of public health to the city of Canton, but it is also sustainable, as it still exists today as one of the most prestigious ophthalmic institutes in the world. Throughout its time open, the hospital set many records in Chinese medical history, including being the first western medicine school in China, and producing the first Chinese medicine magazine and the first x-ray film.Âº†ÊñØ. \\"Canton hospital: the first Western hospital in China_Guangdong News_www.newsgd.com.\\" Canton hospital: the first Western hospital in China_Guangdong News_www.newsgd.com.

In 1838, it led to the creation of the Medical Missionary Society in China, a Protestant medical missionary society established in Canton, which was dedicated to promoting religious missions and gaining the trust of the Chinese through medical care, instead of through preaching.

The story revolves around a CFO of a slaughterhouse and the newly appointed meat quality inspector who discover they can communicate with each other through their dreams, leading to an unlikely romance. It won the Golden Bear in the main competition section of the 67th Berlin International Film Festival. At Berlin it also won the FIPRESCI Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.

Alexandra Borb√©ly won the European Actress award at the European Film Awards for her performance in the film. Plot Endre, a CFO at an abattoir, and M√°ria, the newly hired quality inspector, experience a recurring dream of being a pair of deer in the forest, though they are not aware that it is a shared dream. M√°ria is immediately unpopular at work for her autistic behaviour and uncompromising grading of the abattoir's meat quality. Though Endre tries to befriend her, she quickly becomes uncomfortable with the interaction and rudely comments on his lame left arm. However, she repeats the conversation to herself that night, analyzing where she made her mistakes. Meanwhile, the abattoir hires a new butcher, Sanyi, who Endre takes a quick dislike to due to his cocky demeanor and unsympathetic view towards the slaughtered animals. The abattoir is put under investigation when mating powder is stolen from the inventory; Endre and his friend Jen≈ë both suspect that Sanyi is the culprit. A psychologist is hired to perform personality tests on the workers to discover the culprit. The workers are asked questions on the history of their sexuality and physical development, as well as what they dreamed the night before. When Endre and M√°ria both report the same dream, the psychologist assumes they are playing a prank. Though Endre and M√°ria are both skeptical, they realize that they are indeed experiencing the same dream and grow closer. Though M√°ria's behavior temporarily drives Endre away, they eventually form a tight bond. Endre also learns that Jen≈ë stole the mating powder, but chooses not to inform the police as there are no victims, and he apologizes to Sanyi for suspecting him. Endre and M√°ria decide to fall asleep in the same room one night, but both are unable to sleep. Although she loves him, M√°ria shuts down when Endre touches her after a night of playing cards, leaving Endre offended and confused. The incident affects M√°ria, and she begins to open herself up to new experiences and sensations, such as listening to romantic music, watching pornography, and observing couples at the park. However, Endre has grown pessimistic about their budding relationship and calls it off. He sleeps with another woman, though the encounter leaves him disappointed. A devastated M√°ria prepares to commit suicide at home, calmly slitting her wrist in the bathtub. The suicide is interrupted by Endre calling her, and after a short and awkward conversation, he reveals that he loves her, which M√°ria reciprocates. After getting her wound bandaged, she goes to Endre's home, where they make love. After falling asleep, they wake up to realize that neither of them dreamed the night before.

His decisive leadership at Torgau, in which he snatched victory from defeat, was credited at the time and subsequently with saving the Prussian state. Frederick acknowledged his action with the post-war gift of vast estates near Kunersdorf. Family The Lestwitz's were an old Silesian family, dating to the 14th century with Hannes, a free man who served the Duke of Silesia.Der Schlesische Adel, Volume 2, Rohrlach, 1728 , p. 367, 778. Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz was born on 19 June 1718 in Kontoppe, Duchy of Glogau, part of the Brandenburg Neumark. His father, Johann Georg von Lestwitz, was a lieutenant general in the Prussian Army and his mother, Helen, was Baroness von Kottwitz. As a youth, Lestwitz studied at the University of Frankfurt.Theodor Fontane: Frau von Friedland. In: Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg in 8 B√§nden. Band 2 Oderland. Gotthard Erler, Rudolf Mingau (Hrsg.), Aufbau-Verlag, Berlin 1997, p. 172‚Äì174. Lestwitz's military career emulated that of the sons of other Junkers. Many of the Junkers owned immense estates, especially in the north-eastern part of Prussia (i.e. the provinces of Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, West Prussia, East Prussia and Posen). Their younger sons frequently followed careers as soldiers, starting as Fahnenjunker and accepting commissions in various branches of the military. With so many family members pursuing profitable careers in the military, the Junkers became heavily invested in the success of the Prussian state.William W. Hagen, Ordinary Prussians ‚Äì Brandenburg Junkers and Villagers, 1500‚Äì1840 (Cambridge University Press, 2007) Lestwitz married Catharina Charlotte von Tresckow (1734-1789), and they had one daughter, Helene Charlotte (1754-1803). Charlotte married at the age of 16, but the marriage was later annulled. Based on his successful career in the army, especially during the latter years of the Seven Years' War, Lestwitz was able to invest in property, eventually acquiring substantial holdings near Friedland, both via purchase and gifts from his grateful king.Rolf Gerlach, Zepernick b. Berlin: das Domdorf im Spiegel alter Akten. Lukas Verlag, 2001, p. 398, cfOrtrud W√∂rner-Heil, Adelige Frauen als Pionierinnen der Berufsbildung. Kassel university press GmbH, 2010, pp. 406-407. The property, referred to as Old Friedland, included six farms, several sheep and cow herds and a mill, plus assorted fishing communities. Fishing employed a third of the population until the end of the century.Heinrich Kaak, Untertanen und Herrschaft gemeinschaftlich im Konflikt, in Jan Peters, Gutsherrschaftsgesellschaften im europ√§ischen Vergleich, Walter de Gruyter, 1997, p. 320-326. Eventually his daughter inherited the estates. She drained much of the marshland, creating a more profitable environment.Johann Heinrich Merck, Briefwechsel, volume 3, Wallstein Verlag, 2007, p. 389 cf Charlotte, known by decree of Frederick William II as the Lady of Friedland, was widely considered to be a successful agriculturalist, albeit a \\"very strange woman.\\" Fontane, Frau von Friedland. p. 174‚Äì178. Military career Lestwitz began his military career in 1734 as a Fahnenjunker in the infantry regiment of Kurt Christoph von Schwerin in Frankfurt on the Oder. In the First and Second Silesian Wars, Lestwitz participated in some of the most hotly contested battles: Mollwitz, Chotusitz, Hohenfriedberg, and Soor. In the Seven Years War, after the Battle of Lobositz (1 October 1756), he received the Order Pour le M√©rite. In 1757, Lestwitz's father, Johann Georg von Lestwitz, failed to defend the Breslau fortress from the Austrian-French force, damaging the family's reputation. The population of Breslau supported the Austrians and made the Prussians‚Äô defense difficult. Breslau‚Äôs citizens pressured Lestwitz to vacate the fortress and aided any Prussian deserters. Lestwitz senior surrendered on the night of 25 November on condition of being allowed to withdraw unhindered. Out of 4,227 Prussian soldiers, only 599 of them began the march to Glogau; the rest deserted.Herbert J. Redman, Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War, 1756‚Äì1763, McFarland, 2014, p. 167. The loss of Breslau required Frederick to march cross-country from Rossbach where, earlier in November, he had won a decisive engagement against the Imperial and French forces. In 12 days, Frederick's army covered the to Leuthen, a half day's march from Breslau, where he engaged a superior Imperial force. Following his victory there, Frederick laid siege to Breslau, which surrendered a week later.Spencer Tucker, Battles that Changed History: an Encyclopedia of World Conflict. ABC-CLIO, 2010. pp. 233‚Äì235. Despite his father's failure at Breslau, young Lestwitz maintained Frederick's approval and his actions at the exhausting Battle of Torgau helped to reestablish the family in the eyes of the King. In 1760, now a major, Lestwitz the younger in the infantry regiment \\"Alt-Braunschweig\\", helped to snatch victory from defeat. The King had been was injured by grapeshot; the assault on the Austrian line had failed. Prussian troops, scattered throughout the battlefield, seemed incapable of mounting a coherent assault on the Austrian line. Believing all was lost, Frederick had handed command to Lieutenant General Johann Dietrich von H√ºlsen and started to leave the battlefield. The fighting raged through the night and around dawn, Lestwitz collected scattered troops, organized them into three battalions and led them in a new attack. Lestwitz's action gave decisive support to a concurrent attack of Hans Joachim von Zieten's Hussar Regiment. The additional support changed the tide of battle. Upon the death of the childless Charles Frederick Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt in 1762, his estate reverted to the crown. After the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Frederick II granted these fortunes to the two officers for whom he had particular personal gratitude: Hans Sigismund von Lestwitz received the estate of ; and Joachim Bernhard von Prittwitz, who had escorted the king to safety from the battlefield at the Kunersdorf, received the estate at Quilitz (present-day Kwielice). Theodor Fontane gave this circumstance a special mention, writing: \\"Lestwitz a sauv√© l'etat, Prittwitz a sauv√© le roi.\\" (Lestwitz saved the state, Prittwitz saved the king.\\")Heinrich Kaak, Korporative Gutsherrschaft und Agrarinnovationen in Preussen, BWV Verlag, 2012, p.182 cf The staff officers of the Lestwitz regiment received a golden medal.

In 1765, Lestwitz was appointed colonel, and in 1766 he was appointed Inhaber of the Life Grenadier Regiment. At the outbreak of the War of Bavarian Succession, as a major general, he commanded the right wing of the Prussian army. At the conclusion of this unexciting war, he retired in 1779.

Invited are her friends April, with her estranged German partner Gottfried, a life coach and self-proclaimed spiritual healer, women's studies professor Martha, with her partner Jinny, a renowned chef, and Janet's colleague and subordinate Marianne with husband Tom, a banker. Before the party begins and after the guests arrive, Janet's husband Bill sits in his chair, listening to music, staring vacantly, and drinking wine. All invited guests come, with the exception of Marianne, who Tom says will arrive later. Tom is extremely nervous and immediately locks himself in the bathroom, where he sniffs some cocaine, examines a gun he has brought with him and encourages himself in the mirror. Throughout the party, Janet is exchanging secret phone calls and messages with an unknown lover. While April, who continually belittles and insults Gottfried, gives a toast to Janet, Martha and Jinny announce that Jinny is pregnant with triplets via in vitro fertilisation. This is immediately followed by Bill announcing that he has just been informed by his doctor that he is terminally ill. Gottfried tells him that modern medicine is not to be believed and that by becoming spiritual, Bill may have a chance of surviving. Bill, a well-known atheist intellectual, seems to waver in his commitment to his beliefs and begins to listen to Gottfried. Janet says that she will resign from her shadow minister position and will take care of Bill, but he announces that he is leaving her for Marianne, a fact that Tom had learned earlier that day. After berating Bill, Tom goes into the backyard, where he throws his gun into the dustbin. While Jinny and Martha are talking about the future and motherhood, Martha patronizes Jinny, who, deeply hurt, tells Martha that she will leave her. Martha then confesses to Jinny that she fears what will happen once the babies are born, and pleads with Jinny to stay with her. When Janet throws the burnt vol-au-vents in the dustbin, she finds the gun Tom had thrown away and takes it with her, locking herself in the bathroom and hiding the gun there. She lets April in and they talk about what happened. She asks April, who has been cynical the whole time, to speak honestly with her. April tells her that she is proud of her accomplishments. Gottfried tries to help and coach Tom and Bill, but their discussion escalates when Bill rambles about the love that Marianne and he share. Tom punches him in the face, knocking him out cold. Gottfried and Tom fear that Tom has killed Bill and they try to seek help from the others. They fetch Janet from the bathroom, just when she was starting to tell April a secret. Janet manages to resuscitate Bill, who looks her in the eyes and asks, \\"How did it come to this?\\" At that moment, the doorbell rings, with everybody expecting it to be Marianne. Janet rushes to the bathroom, grabs the gun, runs to open the door, aims the gun at the visitor, who is invisible to the audience, and exclaims, \\"You told me you loved me. ME! You traitor!\\" before it cuts to black.

Formerly a railway bridge, it remains open to pedestrians but one end of the viaduct has been fenced off. History A train crossing the viaduct in September 1973 Lambley viaduct crosses the River South Tyne as a series of elegant stone arches. More than long, it once carried the Haltwhistle to Alston railway. The railway, which was opened in 1852 to haul coal and lead from the Alston mines, closed in 1976, and the viaduct allowed to decay. In 1991 the British Rail Property Board agreed to repair the viaduct and hand it over to the North Pennine Heritage Trust who would maintain it in the future; however the Trust went into administration in 2011. The viaduct was probably designed by George Barclay Bruce, an eminent Victorian engineer who was involved in the Alston line before leaving for India to pioneer railway construction there. It is a particularly elegant example of Victorian engineering: the river is crossed by nine wide arches which support a deck at least above the river but, as it carried a single rail track, only wide. The piers to the arches are built of massive rough-faced stones each weighing up to , with similar-sized stones in ashlar to the main arch voussoirs. The spandrels and piers to the wide approach arches are built of coursed rubble masonry. One end of the viaduct has been fenced off, after the path was diverted in 2004 to pass further away from Lambley railway station, which is now a private house. It is a Grade II* listed structure.

He participated in twelve campaigns, ten battles, nine sieges. He received the Black Eagle Order, the Order Pour le M√©rite, and was included in 1851 on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. He is general credited with creating Frederick the Great's vaunted horse artillery. Family His parents were Karl Vollradt von Dieskau (1677-1762), lord of Benndorf, and his second wife, Johanna Eleonore von K√∂rbener, daughter of Heinrich Wilhelm von K√∂rbener. Dieskau himself never married, but his grand-nephew was Field Marshal Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke.Gothaisches genealogisches Taschenbuch der adeligen H√§user, 1905. Sechster Jahrgang, p.226 Karl Volrad von Dieskau. Military career Dieskau joined the Prussian military on 2 February 1721, and became a bombardier. On 12 April 1727, he was raised to second lieutenant; in 1730 to first lieutenant; on 13 December 1737, he was appointed staff captain, on 19 November 1741, company captain; and on 15 October 1746 promoted to major. =Dieskau and artillery= When Frederick became king in 1741, his army was behind the times in artillery. Not only were there not enough guns, but their quality was poor. While other armies had learned to bore through a solid core, the Prussians still cast over a core. This made their guns unreliable and difficult to match gauges between and among guns. Furthermore, in the armies of the 1740s, it was artillery, not muskets, that inflicted the heaviest casualties.Tim Blanning, Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. Random House Publishing Group, 2016, 9781400068128 p. 289. Dieskau had already made several contributions to the development of the artillery. Although the King despised artillery men in general, Frederick recognized the value of the units and had brought in Field Marshall Samuel von Schmettau as the artillery \\"grand master.\\" By 1741, Frederick had formed a second battalion that included a bombardier and five cannon companies. The bombardiers manned the howitzers and mortars, the most specialized tasks; the cannon companies were distributed throughout the army. In 1742, he created an additional artillery garrison at Breslau. In 1744, two battalions received the title of Field Regiment Artillery, under command of Schmettau, although the aging General Christian Nicolaus von Linger, the artillery master of Frederick Wilhelm I, remained in nominal command.Philip Haythornthwaite, Frederick the Great's Army (3): Specialist Troops, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012, 9781780967622 page. The expansion of artillery service as well as Frederick's increasing dependence upon it improved Dieskau's opportunities for advancement. On 9 July 1752, he received the Order Pour le M√©rite, and also the king gave him a magnificent tobacco pot. On 20 April 1755, Dieskau was appointed lieutenant colonel and on 28 February 1757, finally, colonel and General Inspector of the Artillery and all artillery material. By 1756, Frederick had increased the number artillery to over 662 guns. In this position, he was active during the Seven Years' War, responsible for the preparation and execution of all measures relating to the replacement of armaments, equipment and ammunition. During this war, Frederick is usually credited with the creation of the first horse artillery, not intended as cavalry but simply as units that could move rapidly around the battlefield and to offer support where necessary. Early in the Seven Years' War, under Dieskau's leadership, the companies were enlarged to 300, and the regiment included three battalions, adding two new companies. One of Dieskau's design compromises, introduced in 1755, was the light 6-pound gun on a four- horse team, and a longer barrelled 3-pound gun. Guns were drawn on four-horse teams. Each pair of guns had three non-commissioned officers, and the battalion had 42 gunners, who were mounted and had been trained by dragoons; the gunners dismounted for battle, one man holding the horses and the remainder firing the weapons. At the Battle of Leuthen in 1757, Frederick's nascent mobile artillery kept pace with the rapidly-moving infantry and laid devastating barrages upon the Austrian lines.J. F. C. Fuller, A Military History of the Western World, Da Capo Press, 1987, p. 212-215. Officially, Frederick's first horse artillery detachment, created through a Cabinet Order in April 1759, included six 6-pound guns, referred to as \\"light\\" guns.Kronoskaf editors, Prussian Horse Artillery. See Grosser Generalstab Kriegsgeschichtliche Abteilung II, Die Kriege Friedrichs des Grossen, Part 3 Der siebenj√§hrige Krieg 1756-1763, Vol. 1 Pirna und Lobositz, Berlin, 1901, Appendix 1, and Generlieutenant von Strotha, K√∂niglich Preussische Reitende Artillerie vom Jahre 1759 bis 1816. Berlin 1868, Vossische Buchhandlung. 30 November 2014 version. Accessed 6 March 2017. The types of guns might include 6-pound guns, a 7-pound howitzer, and 3-pound guns. The horse artillery was lost at Kunersdorf, replaced quickly, and then lost again at Maxen. Between 1754 and 1771, nine prototypes had been introduced into the Prussian artillery, based on Dieskau's designs. Although the mobile artillery was disbanded after the Seven Years War, by 1768, while Dieskau was still General Inspector of the Artillery, they had been reformed with greater power and mobility. Frederick promoted Dieskau to major general on 18 October 1762; on 16 May 1768, he received his promotion to lieutenant general was made a Knight of the Black Eagle Order. Karl Wilhelm von Dieskau died unmarried on 14 August 1777 in Berlin. A solemn funeral was held in Berlin by order of Frederick II. In 1851, his name was included with other founders of the Prussian state on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great by Frederick's great-great nephew, Frederick William IV.Denkmal K√∂nig Friedrichs des Gro√üen.

Having debuted in 1844 with Espanioletto, or Father and Artist (its Alexandrinsky Theatre production panned by both Nekrasov and Belinsky), Efimovich soon eschewed melodrama in favour of stark realism and in the course of the next two years developed into a sophisticated author, sensitive to Russian lower classes' real life problems, as well as language. Efimovich has been credited as a master of psychological drama of his time, an exponent of the then popular natural school and a follower of Gogol.

It stars Olivia Cooke, Anya Taylor-Joy, Anton Yelchin, Paul Sparks and Francie Swift. The film had its world premiere under its original title Thoroughbred at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2017, and was released on March 9, 2018, by Focus Features. It is the last U.S. theatrical release to star Yelchin, who died in June 2016. Thoroughbreds follows high-school student Lily (Taylor-Joy) and her emotionless friend Amanda (Cooke) as they scheme to kill Lily's stepfather (Sparks) via a contract with a drug dealer (Yelchin). The film grossed $3 million against a \\"mid-seven-figure budget\\" and received positive reviews from critics, who praised the ambitious direction, screenplay, and performances, particularly from Cooke and Taylor-Joy. Plot In suburban Connecticut, upper-class high schooler Amanda euthanizes her crippled horse with a knife, resulting in charges of animal cruelty. Sometime later, Amanda arrives at the home of the more popular and academically inclined Lily. The girls were previously best friends but grew apart after the death of Lily's father. They meet under the pretense of hanging out and having a casual tutoring session, but Amanda knows that her mother has paid Lily to socialize with Amanda. Lily denies being paid, but Amanda left emotionless by an unspecified mental disorder, is unfazed. Lily meets with Amanda again, this time voluntarily, and they rekindle their friendship. Lily lives with her mother, Cynthia, and stepfather, Mark, who she hates. One night, Amanda asks if Lily has ever thought about killing Mark, upsetting Lily. However, tensions flare between Lily and Mark when Mark enrolls Lily in a boarding school for girls with behavioral issues. After seeing him berate Cynthia, Lily reconsiders and calls Amanda about the notion of killing him. She proposes that Amanda perform the murder as Amanda would not experience guilt. However, Amanda believes that her pending animal-cruelty trial would make her an immediate suspect. They decide instead to blackmail drug dealer Tim into murdering Mark while the two girls are out of town. The night of the planned murder, Tim arrives on the property but leaves without killing Mark. The girls agree not to contact Tim again, as his own criminal history will prevent him from alerting the police. Lily impulsively prepares to kill Mark herself but is talked out of it by Amanda. One night, Lily and Amanda are watching a film at Lily's home when Lily reveals she spiked Amanda's drink with Rohypnol so she could stab Mark to death and frame Amanda. Lily attempts to back out of the plan, but Amanda, realizing a life spent without emotions is \\"meaningless,\\" willingly finishes the drink. While Amanda is unconscious, Lily murders Mark and rubs Amanda with his blood, crying and holding the unconscious Amanda for comfort. Sometime later, Lily encounters Tim, who now works as a restaurant valet. Following Mark's death, Lily has once again found academic success and is interviewing for college admission. They talk about the murder (though Lily lies about what really happened), and Lily mentions having received a letter from Amanda, who has been committed to a psychiatric hospital for the crime. The letter is shown to detail Amanda's life at the hospital, including a recurring dream about a future in which humans let the world fall into disarray due to their vanity, leading to it being overrun by thoroughbred horses. When Tim asks what the letter said, Lily says she threw the letter away without reading it.

He was very keyed into that aspect of this movie, he loved film noir. I felt really, like I knew nothing about movies, talking to him.

He holds a B.A. from Missouri State University, a master¬¥s degree from the Pushkin Institute (Moscow, Russia) and a doctorate from Universidade Federal Fluminense (Brazil). He is an associate professor of history at the University of Sao Paulo. Segrillo¬¥s doctoral dissertation ‚Äî published under the title O Decl√≠nio da URSS: um estudo das causas (‚ÄúThe Decline of the USSR: a study of its causes‚Äù) ‚Äî was the first major Brazilian academic work using first-hand research into the formerly classified Soviet files. He analyzed the decline of the Soviet economy in its last decades not as a purely internal process, but as accompanying (and associated with) the changes in the world economy, which was moving from Fordist to Post-Fordist paradigms. The rigid, vertically oriented Soviet system had been competitive with the West in the decades when the (similarly rigid, vertically oriented) Fordism was paramount. However, when flexible post-Fordist paradigms (such as Toyotism) came along and set new rules for the game, the USSR started having problems of adaptation to these new requirements of flexibility. An abridged version of this argument can be seen in English in a short essay titled The Decline of the Soviet Union, Notable among other books written by Angelo Segrillo in Portuguese are R√∫ssia e Brasil em Compara√ß√£o (‚ÄúRussia and Brazil in Comparison‚Äù, a comparative analysis of Russian and Brazilian political parties in the process of democratization since 1985) and R√∫ssia: Europa ou √Åsia (‚ÄúRussia: Europe or Asia?‚Äù, about the debates between Westernizers, Slavophiles and Eurasianists and how these identity questions shape Russia¬¥s foreign policy today between East and West). Among his works in the English language, Professor Segrillo proposed a new index to measure political and economic democracy in his 2012 article, Liberalism, Marxism and Democratic Theory Revisited: Proposal of a Joint Index of Political and Economic Democracy. He also presented the first complete translation into English of Peter the Great¬¥s original Table of Ranks in a 2016 paper.http://lea.vitis.uspnet.usp.br/arquivos/arttableofrankslea.pdf In 2020, three of the main books by A.

With two locations in the Chelsea neighborhood, the gallery specializes in contemporary and modern art, representing an international group of established and emerging artists, as well as historical artist estates.  History and Program  Andrea Rosen Gallery opened in January 1990 with an inaugural exhibition of paper stack works by Felix Gonzalez-Torres at the gallery's original location at 130 Prince Street in SoHo This exhibition would set the agenda for the gallery's program, conceptually rigorous and advocating an awareness of our responsibility as artists and participants within both the contemporary art world and history. Since its inception, a key part of the gallery program has been to juxtapose historical material with contemporary work, as well as artists working out of distinct histories. \\"How do you put works in context with each other in a way that allows you to see more in them?\\" asks Andrea Rosen, \\"I'm interested in works that expand our perception of what we might already think.\\" Andrea Rosen had a role in developing the early careers of such artists as John Currin, Rita Ackermann, John Coplans, Sean Landers, and Wolfgang Tillmans, as well as Andrea Zittel, Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch, Mika Rottenberg, and David Altmejd whom the gallery continues to represent. In 1998, the gallery moved to its current primary location at 525 West 24th Street in Chelsea, opening with Andrea Zittel's seminal exhibition Raugh, featuring a series of A-Z Administration living environments. As a content- and experience-driven and experimental expansion of the primary gallery program, the Andrea Rosen Gallery 2 program was initiated in October 1999. First housed within the main gallery at 525 West 24th Street, Gallery 2 moved to its current location at 544 West 25th Street in 2012. The Gallery 2 program has developed a reputation for shedding light on lesser-known aspects of prominent artists' practices, as well as presenting significant historical exhibitions, first-time one-person shows of emerging artists, experimental projects by gallery artists, and artist-curated shows. The inaugural show, Cellblock II: An Essay in Exhibition Form, was curated by scholar and curator Robert Hobbs and featured works by Vito Acconci, Alice Aycock, Robert Gober, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, Ad Reinhardt, and Sterling Ruby, among others. In 2015, Andrea Rosen Gallery celebrated its 25th anniversary. In commemoration, the gallery published a limited edition set of twenty-six books, comprising twenty-five volumes dedicated to notable curated group exhibitions, as well as a complete exhibition chronology.

He committed suicide in 1949 by jumping in front of a train at Hitchin railway station when facing disciplinary proceedings from The Law Society. Early years Hine was born in 1883 at Newnham Hall near Baldock in Hertfordshire, the son of Alderman Joseph Neville Hine (1849‚Äì1931), a tenant farmer, and his wife Eliza Taylor (1843‚Äì1892). Hine was educated at Grove House in Baldock, was privately tutored by the Revd George Todd of Baldock, attended Kent College in Canterbury and The Leys School in Cambridge.Alan L. Fleck, ‚ÄòHine, Reginald Leslie (1883‚Äì1949)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Dec 2016 Minsden Chapel T.W. Latchmore's hoax photograph of the Minsden ghost (1907) In 1907 he and two others, the Hitchin photographer Thomas William Latchmore (1882‚Äì1946)Thomas William Latchmore on the 'Herts Memories' website and the noted artist and etcher F. L. Griggs, took a camera to Minsden Chapel with the intention of photographing the ghost of a monk who it was believed had been murdered there and whose spirit was said to emerge from the stone walls of the ruined chapel. Hine claimed that they had been successful and published the resulting photograph in his The History of Hitchin. The photograph is now accepted as having been a practical joke at best, and a hoax at worst, but Hine never admitted this,Whitmore, Richard The Ghosts of Reginald Hine (2007, Mattingley Press (Hitchin) pp. 113‚Äì116 and its inclusion in what was purported to be a work of serious history is questionable. The shrouded figure is almost certainly that of Hine. Hine frequently visited here, and eventually obtained a lifetime lease of the building from the vicars of Hitchin. So fond of the chapel was he, that he even bade \\"trespassers and sacrilegious persons take warning, for I will proceed against them with the utmost rigour of the law, and, after my death and burial, I will endeavour, in all ghostly ways, to protect and haunt its hallowed walls\\".Hine, Reginald L. The History of Hitchin, Vol II page 38 (1929, Allen and Unwin (London)) Solicitor and historian Hine studied law and became an articled clerk at 18, working for the long-established firm of Hawkins and Company of Hitchin, but despite his claims to the contrary he did not qualify as a solicitor until he was 50 in 1933. He then went into partnership with local solicitor Reginald Hartley, and for the remaining 16 years of his life Hine practised with the firm of Hartley and Hine'An Uncommon Attorney' ‚Äì New Law Journal 7 September 2007 until his sudden retirement on 31 March 1949, just two weeks before his death. In 1910 he delivered a lecture on the history of The Manor of Newnham, where he had been born 27 years earlier. Hine married Florence Lee Pyman (b. 1888/9) on 11 April 1912 in Hampstead and their daughter Felicity was born in 1915. The marriage was not a happy one as Hine's outgoing personality contrasted with that of his colder and more upright wife. Hine was judged unfit for military service during World War I and he and his family moved to Hitchin in 1917 and to nearby Willian in 1929. In the same year Hine was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and in 1930 a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. He was one of the founders of Hitchin Museum which houses many of his own documents. An unenthusiastic solicitor, Hine's first love was the study of the history of his home area. He wrote a number of volumes on the history of Hitchin and its environs, including his The History of Hitchin (1929) and Hitchin Worthies (1932), which won national acclaim. In 1934 he was commissioned to write the History of Stagenhoe.'Reginald Hine and Preston' ‚Äì A History of Preston in Hertfordshire Historian W. G. Hoskins described Hine's The History of Hitchin as \\"first class\\", while Professor G. M. Trevelyan said \\"I have nothing but admiration for the method, plan and style of it\\". However, others were not so enthusiastic about Hine's works, questioning his use of sources and historical accuracy, further claiming that Hine would often stretch the facts to make a good story.

At the time of his death Hine, who suffered acutely from depression for much of his later years, faced being struck-off as a solicitor for professional misconduct by contacting both sides in a divorce case which was against The Law Society rules, and having bought a return ticket to London he may have been on his way to a meeting there regarding this. He left behind 60 boxes of material for his planned History of Hertfordshire.'History: Reginald Hine and Hitchin' ‚Äì Hertfordshire Life 12 November 2011 He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium at the same time that his memorial service was being held at St Mary's Church in Hitchin and his ashes scattered at Minsden Chapel on 19 April 1949. His family erected a memorial stone at the site, which was subsequently re-laid in its current grave-like horizontal position after being damaged by vandals in the early 1980s.

At the age of fifteen, he went to Oslo to attend the Royal Drawing School. From 1871 to 1874, he attended the private art school operated by Knud Bergslien and Morten M√ºller, who had a great influence on his style.Marianne Yvenes. Ludvig Skramstad Norsk Biografisk Leksikon. After 1874, he went to D√ºsseldorf, where he attended the private school of fellow Norwegian artist . In 1875, he took a study trip along the Rhine, then returned to Norway. Once there, he travelled to Gudbrandsdalen, Sogn, Hardanger and Hallingdal. His first exhibition was in 1875 at the Oslo Kunstforening. In 1878, a grant from \\"Sch√§ffers Legat\\", for painters and sculptors, enabled him to visit London and Paris. In 1884, he married Aurora Guidotti (1855-1888), the daughter of an immigrant Italian pewter maker. She died four years later and he married her sister, Vincentia Sofie Emma Guidotti (1852-1944) who outlived him by thirty-two years. Thanks to a government travel scholarship, he was able to spend the years 1885-86 in Munich. When he returned, he built a house in Dr√∏bak. Around 1900, due to financial woes, he began getting up early every morning to paint several pictures that he sold at bargain prices. He stayed there until 1902 then, possibly because of continued negative criticism (notably from Jens Thiis, who wrote that Skramstad had \\"wasted his talents\\" on repetitive paintings) he left his family and went back to Munich to work for a German art dealer. He died in Munich ten years later. There is a display of his work at the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design (Nasjonalmuseet) which includes Utsikt over dalf√∏re and Vinterlandskap.

Smythe (July 14, 1844 ‚Äì September 5, 1908) was the United States ambassador to Liberia from 1878 to 1881 and from 1882 to 1885. Before his appointment, he had various clerkships in the federal government in Washington, DC and in Wilmington, North Carolina. Later in his life he took part in a number of leading African American organizations and was president of a Reformatory School outside of Richmond, Virginia. Early life John H. Smythe was born on July 14, 1844 in Richmond, Virginia to Sully and Ann Eliza Smythe. Sully died in 1857 and Ann Eliza died in 1883. Smythe was taught to read between the ages of five and seven. About the age of eight or nine he was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to be educated, and he first attended a Quaker school and then a grammar school. When Smythe's father died, he quit school and took a job as an errand boy in a dry goods store, although he returned to school after a year. in 1859 he entered the Quaker run Institute for Colored Youth led by Ebenezer D. Bassett, graduating May 4, 1862. Bassett would later be minister-resident to Haiti, holding the position 4 years before Smythe would be diplomat to Liberia. Smythe was a talented painter, and was admitted a member of the Academy of Fine Arts at Philadelphia, focusing on landscapes. After graduating, in 1864, he worked as a laborer in the china house of Tyndale & Mitchell, and worked as an Army sutler's clerk for a short time during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865).Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p872-877 Career =London and Washington, DC= In 1865, on the recommendation of John W. Forney and Shelton Mackenzie, Smythe traveled to London to learn acting, intending to meet with the famous actors Ira Aldridge (who was in St. Petersburg and Smythe did not meet) and Samuel Phelps. Smythe's money ran short and he returned home, abandoning hopes for a career on the stage. Smythe took manual labor work and, on the advice of William Whipple, began teaching at a school in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. In 1869, Smythe enrolled at Howard University Law School where John Mercer Langston was dean. As a student, he was appointed by Henry M. Wittlesey clerk in the Freedmen's Bureau on January 12, 1870. On August 15 of that year he resigned to become a clerk in the United States Census. Smythe was one of the forty- nine clerks who resigned from that department in protest in 1872, and he was then appointed clerk in the internal revenue agent of the Treasury Department on August 1, 1872, resigning that appointment in November to take another appointment from George S. Boutwell as internal revenue storekeeper. He resigned from this position on January 8, 1873 to take a position as a clerk in the Freedman's Savings Bank in Washington, DC, but was soon sent to Wilmington, North Carolina to be a cashier in the bank there. When the Freedmen's Bank failed, Smythe remained in Wilmington and passed the North Carolina Bar. =Wilmington and Liberia= In Wilmington, Smythe was politically active. He was a member of the State Constitutional Convention in 1875 and supported the Republican Party, campaigning for Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes in their presidential campaigns. He became acquainted with a man named Adam Empie, and through him to Senator Matthew W. Ransom, who in 1878 recommended Smythe to Secretary of State William M.

He was recalled by President James A. Garfield and reappointed by President Chester A. Arthur on April 12, 1882. During his terms, he also had charge of the German Consulate at Monrovia for six months, and for a short time the Belgian Consulate. He also represented the King of Norway and Sweden, Oscar II of Sweden, on the request of the minister from the Union of Sweden and Norway to the United States, Carl Lewenhaupt. In Africa, he hired natives to their countries to posts of consuls and consular agents in Africa, creating good relations between the nations of West Central Africa and the United States. He was given an honorary LL. D. by the board of trustees at Liberia College, and was appointed knight commander of the Liberian Humane Order of African Redemption by Liberian president Hilary R. W. Johnson on December 28, 1885. Smythe was recalled by President Grover Cleveland on March 25, 1885, and returned to Washington DC to practice law. =Participation in civic organizations= In December 1877, Smythe was one of a number of important African-American leaders who formed the Negro American Society, led by Alexander Crummell and John Wesley Cromwelland also including T.

It is located in peninsular Denmark in Aarhus Municipality, south of Harlev and some 10 km. west of Aarhus. It is a deciduous forest covering some 50 hectares and it is composed mainly of beech and European ash. It is privately owned but protected and partially managed by Aarhus Municipality and the Danish Nature Agency. The Natura 2000 site covers 135 hectares and also encompasses T√•strup Bog, T√•strup Lake and Stj√¶r Forest, south of Lillering Forest. The southern section with Stj√¶r Forest is within, and managed by, Skanderborg Municipality.  Flora and fauna  Lillering Forest and surroundings has been known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, about a third of Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as dead-nettles, white butterbur, bitter-cress, wall barley, yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between T√•strup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and mountain melick. The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with buckthorns that grow at the woodland edge or in T√•strup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of mouse-ear chickweed. The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the six-spot burnet which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge.

Cattle rubbing stones need to be well dug into the ground and/or packed with stones and have also to be made of hard stone types that can withstand the considerable weight and strength of cattle.

Some stones may show drill marks from the quarrying process. The shape is based on the need for appropriate height and strength without occupying too much space. The use of Ordnance Survey maps from different years may show that the stones were installed by farmers and they may marked as 'Rubbing stones'.Meanecht rubbing stones on Camore.Drimmies rubbing stone on Canmore =Identification= A holed stone probably damaged by cattle using it as a rubbing stone. The polishing action caused by cattle rubbing is clearly visible. Rubbing stone showing churned up soil and lack of vegetation caused by the cattle. The polishing effect is also obvious. In Scotland the word 'yokey' was generally used for cattle that had itchy skin. Cattle rubbing stones were often made from harder stone such as whinstone or granite depending on the geology of the area concerned. An indicator that a stone is used by cattle for alleviating skin irritation is the polished appearance of the areas that have been used by many generations of cattle over the years. The ground around rubbing stones is often churned up and devoid of vegetation. Stones may also have areas of staining caused by the transfer of oil from the hide of the cattle during the rubbing process. Some standing stones owe their survival partly due to their practical functionality as cattle rubbing stonesPeat Hill stone on Canmore although some megalithic sites have had to be protected from the damage that cattle can and do cause as indicated by the attached photograph. The proximity to known megalithic sites is also a clue as to the actual origins of rubbing stones. Stones with ancient carvings on them such as cup and rings, petrosomatoglyphs, Pictish, early Christian, Ogham, etc. indicate their origins even if they have a rubbing stone function.

Marker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency 21-deoxycortisol is a marker of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, even in mild (non-classic) cases. The deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme leads to excess of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, a 21-carbon (C21) steroid. This excess is accompanied by the accumulation of other C21 steroids, such as 21-deoxycortisol, which is formed by the 11Œ≤-hydroxylation of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone via 11Œ≤-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). The build-up of 21-deoxycortisol in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been described since at least 1955, this steroid was then called \\"21-desoxyhydrocortisone\\". Unlike 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, 21-deoxycortisol is not produced in the gonads and is uniquely adrenal-derived. Hence, 21-deoxycortisol is a more specific biomarker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency than is 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone. The corticosteroid activity of 21-deoxycortisol is lower to that of cortisol. As 21-deoxycortisol can be at high levels in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and it has structural similarity to cortisol, it can cross-react in immunoassays, resulting in a falsely normal or high cortisol result, when the true cortisol is actually low. Whereas immunoassays can suffer from cross-reactivity due to interactions with structural analogues, the selectivity offered by liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has largely overcome these limitations. Hence, the use of LC-MS/MS instead of immunoassays in cortisol measurement aims to provide greater specificity. Besides 21-deoxycortisol, another C21 steroid, 21-deoxycorticosterone (11Œ≤-hydroxyprogesterone), has been proposed as a marker for 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but this marker did not gain acceptance due to the fact that testing for the levels of this steroid is not routinely offered by diagnostic laboratories.

History The construction of the mosque began in August 2012 after the Algerian government's contract, for 1 billion euros, was won by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation.

The mosque faced construction delays owing to budgetary concerns due to the falling prices of oil.

Based on the 1971 book The Little Broomstick by Mary Stewart, this is Studio Ponoc's first feature film. The film tells a story of a girl named Mary Smith who finds \\"fly-by-night\\", a mysterious flower that can give her the power to become a witch for only one night. The film was released in Japan on 8 July 2017. In the English-language version of the film, which was concurrently released with a subtitled version in the United States on 19 January 2018, the film features the voices of Ruby Barnhill, Kate Winslet, and Jim Broadbent. Plot Mary Smith moves into the northern English country estate of her Great Aunt Charlotte. The bored, friendless girl tries to make herself useful through chores, but repeatedly messes up. A local boy named Peter teases her for her clumsiness and wild red hair. Tib-cat and Gib-cat, Peter's cats, lead Mary to some mysterious glowing flowers. The gardener identifies the flowers as \\"fly-by-night\\"; legend has it that witches covet the flower for its magical power. The next day, Gib-cat disappears. Tib- cat leads Mary to a broomstick but she accidentally bursts a fly-by-night bulb on it. The bulb releases magical power, making the broomstick come to life and enabling Mary to ride it like a witch. The Little Broomstick whisks Mary away to a complex of buildings in the clouds, known as Endor College for witches. Head mistress Madam Mumblechook assumes Mary is a new pupil with Tib-cat as her familiar, and takes her on a tour of the college. She introduces Mary to Doctor Dee, the college's renowned chemistry teacher. Mary finds herself able to perform advanced spells such as invisibility. Madam and Doctor Dee become convinced that Mary is a prodigy because of her performance as well as her red hair, which is a distinguishing feature among the best witches. Mary admits that her magical ability comes from fly-by-night, and that Tib-cat belongs to Peter. Madam's attitude changes then but she lets Mary return home once Mary turns over Peter's address. That night, Madam sends a message to Mary, informing that she's kidnapped Peter, and demands that Mary bring the fly-by- night bulbs to her. She and Tib-cat quickly fly back to Endor with the bulbs, but Madam and Doctor Dee imprison her in their transformation lab. Mary finds Peter locked in with her, and discovers that Doctor Dee has been experimenting on animals, including Gib-cat, transforming them into fantastic creatures. From the spell book she took from Madam's office, Mary uses a spell to undo the transformations and unlock the lab. They try to escape on the Little Broomstick, but Peter is recaptured. The Little Broomstick takes Mary to an isolated cottage on a tiny island that seems to be alive. Inside the cottage, Mary finds notes on spells and a mirror that Great-Aunt Charlotte uses to contact her. Through visions, Charlotte reveals that the cottage was her old home, and she used to be a red-haired pupil who excelled at Endor. One day Charlotte found fly-by-night on the campus, leading Madam and Doctor Dee to obsessively pursue a project to use the flower to transform all humans into witches. When their experiments failed, Charlotte escaped Endor, taking the flower with her. Charlotte begs Mary to use her last bulbs to return home, but Mary vows to rescue Peter. Mary returns to Endor and finds Madam and Doctor Dee trying to transform Peter into a witch. The experiment fails again, leaving Peter trapped within a gelatinous monster. Mary gets the spell book to Peter, and he uses it to undo the failed experiment and all of Madam and Doctor Dee's research. Mary and Peter fly home, with her throwing away her last bulb and saying she does not need magic. Characters *Mary Smith, an 11 year old who is the main character of this story. She is innocent and often curious. She has red hair tied in twin bunches to the side, blue eyes, and freckles.

It was originally released for iOS mobile devices in June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014. Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae Rally series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in point- to-point rally events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions. The title marked Codemasters' debut in developing a mobile game internally. The goal of the project was to create a core, rally racing experience for mobile devices. The development team chose to use Colin McRae Rally 2.0 as the foundation, taking its tracks, driving model, and pacenotes for the new title. Original vehicle models were reused however aspects of the game's graphics were enhanced to provide the higher visual quality expected by modern standards. Numerous sound assets were replaced with samples from other Codemasters driving games. Compared to the positive reception to previous games in the series, reception towards the 2013 release was mixed. The primary criticism among professional reviewers was the lack of content and omission of important features. However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the level of difficulty and realistic driving model would appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players. Gameplay Players can use on- screen buttons to steer and control the vehicle. The progress indicator at the top displays how much of the rally stage has been completed. Colin McRae Rally is a racing video game in which players can drive cars in point-to-point rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car perspective or from a bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide digital input or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off- road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the co-driver and icons that appear near the top of the screen. The icons display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A progress indicator is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers. The game features three modes: Championship, Single Rally, and Single Stage. The Championship mode is split into eight rallies, each composed of either twelve or twenty-four stages. To win a rally, the player must attain the lowest total time against the computer drivers. The total time is taken as the summation of each individual stage time. Players begin the game with a single vehicle, the Ford Focus RS WRC; three additional cars‚Äîthe Subaru Impreza WRX, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, and the Lancia Stratos‚Äîcan be unlocked by placing first in the championship rallies. During a race, vehicles can sustain damage from collisions, which can subsequently be repaired at intervals after every two events. Development and release Colin McRae Rally was developed by Codemasters' Southam-based development studio. It was the company's first internally developed mobile game, and lead off an initiative to produce games for new and existing intellectual property specifically for mobile devices. The development team was composed of staff who had worked on early Colin McRae Rally games and more recent Codemasters racing games. The game was initially designed for iOS mobile devices using Colin McRae Rally 2.0 as a basis. This early iteration of their Rally series was chosen as the foundation because it presented a focused rally racing experience, whereas later entries expanded to offer more gimmicks and game modes. Thirty stages from Rally 2.0 were faithfully reproduced; the team ensured that the position of every corner, obstacle, and surface transition matched the original rallies. While existing content and assets were reused, they also chose to take advantage of modern technology while creating Colin McRae Rally. The game was built using the Unity game engine and written in the C# programming language, closely referencing the original C source code to make certain that the handling and physics systems replicate Rally 2.0. The development team felt that the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as the focal point of the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game. The development team had access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result was a combination of audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from Race Driver: Grid, and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game. The game was released for iOS devices on 27 June 2013. In December 2013, Thumbstar Games announced that they would be collaborating with Codemasters to release the game on Android devices. The Android version released on 21 February 2014. Codemasters later released the game for OS X and Windows personal computers on 31 July 2014 via the Steam digital distribution service. Reception Colin McRae Rally received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from professional critics according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Scott Nichols of Digital Spy thought the visual upgrade over the classic games would be appreciated by nostalgic fans but felt that controls were not up to par. He stated that steering was over-sensitive with both control schemes, and this issue was not rectified by the absence of options to adjust steering sensitivity. Pocket Gamer reviewer Mark Brown credited the game for taking the series back to its roots. However, he questioned some of the design choices, particularly the exclusion of features present in the original games that he regarded as important. He pointed out that the lack of manual transmission, cockpit view, and ability to tweak car settings may have been the result of trying to make the game more accessible among a wider audience or due to a rushed development cycle. Writing for TouchArcade, Karl Burnett said the restricted set of environments made the game a bit of grind to play. He did praise the game's sense of speed and physics model however; he believed that the car handling and physics identically matched the first two iterations of the series. He concluded that it was a satisfactory game that was ultimately held back by the limited amount of content in the package. VideoGamer.com writer Pete Worth considered the game to be too difficult, highlighting that it had \\"limited appeal\\" amongst players who were not rally fans or dedicated to racing games. Slide to Play also agreed that the challenge posed by the game would by enjoyed by hardcore players but might be off-putting for a beginner. They identified some performance issues but ultimately thought that Codemasters had effectively transitioned the series from console to mobile devices. The OS X and Windows versions of the game were subject to harsh criticism from players who were expecting a high definition remake of the original 1998 Colin McRae Rally rather than a port of the mobile game. Acting in response to the negative reaction, Codemasters updated the product's description on Steam to clarify previous misunderstandings and offered refunds to customers for a period of time.

Although the Guardians of the Dawn, whose official motto is \\"A homeland that we do not protect is one we do not deserve to live in\\", promote themselves as a Syrian nationalist force, their fighters are primarily motivated by a concept of holy war to defend the Christian areas of Syria from hostile rebels. The militiamen of Usud al-Cherubim, one of the coalition's constituent groups, even refer to themselves as \\"mujahideen of the cross\\".  History  Following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2012, several Christian militias were formed to fight for the Syrian government against insurgents. These groups were generally organized as self-defense units, as Syrian rebels began to attack Christian religious sites and kidnap Christians for ransom soon after the insurgency gained momentum. The Syrian government was also interested in arming Christian militias, as these were generally loyal and relieved the hard-pressed Syrian Army. Christian units played a major role in the fighting for the Qalamun Mountains 2013‚Äì14, where several important Christian centers are located, such as the towns of Maarounah and Yabroud, as well as the Cherubim Convent near Saidnaya. According to their official leader, Fadi Abd al-Massih Khouri, the Guardians of the Dawn were established on 11 September 2015, when various Christian militias banded together to defend Maarounah from an attack by Jaysh al-Islam; as this ad-hoc alliance proved highly successful, the coalition was promptly formalized under Khouri's leadership. The idea behind its foundation was that the different Christian militias should help each other when their villages come under assault. Initially, the new coalition was known as \\"Homeland Shield\\" (\\"Dir‚Äô al-Watan\\"), and soon began to participate in various campaigns to defend or capture Christian localities in Syria: In late 2015 the member groups joined a government offensive in the western Homs Governorate, during which they helped to retake Sadad and Mahin from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. For these operations they received the official gratitude of Sootoro. In March 2016 the alliance adopted its current name, and later that year sent fighters to the northern Hama Governorate in order to defend a number of Christian villages from a Jihadist-led rebel offensive. The Guardians also took part in the fighting for Qamhana during the Hama offensive (March‚ÄìApril 2017). Besides these campaigns, the Guardians of the Dawn are also very active throughout the Rif Dimashq Governorate, taking part in various offensives against rebel-held eastern Ghouta and the Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat; the latter operation was partly framed by Usud al-Cherubim as \\"liberating its [Darayya's] churches\\". Khouri also ran as parliamentary candidate in the elections of April 2016, though failed to win a seat.  Constituent groups  * Lions of the Cherubim (\\"Usud al-Cherubim\\"): Formed in 2013 as \\"local 'monastery defence' force\\" for the Cherubim Convent near Saidnaya, the Usud al-Cherubim have become very active throughout western Syria since 2014. They claim to have participated in the various government offensives in the Qalamun Mountains (2013, 2014, 2015), the conquest of Jobar, the battles of Eastern Ghouta, the Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat, the Homs offensive (November‚ÄìDecember 2015), and the Hama offensive in 2016. Furthermore, the Usud al-Cherubim were instrumental in the creation of the Guardians of the Dawn coalition. One of the unit's contingents is named \\"Earthquake of Jobar\\" (\\"Zilzal Jobar\\"). The exact size of the unit is unknown; their widespread military activity suggests that the Usud al-Cherubim can count upon a considerable number of fighters, while their very light casualties imply that their actual military strength is rather weak. * Ararat Group * Lions of the Valley (\\"Usud al-Wadi\\"): A self-defense group from Wadi al-Nasara, a valley whose population is almost exclusively (98%) Christian. * Lions of Hamidiya (\\"Usud al-Hamidiya\\"): This unit, originating in the Hamidiya neighbourhood of Homs and led by Rami Marina, left the Guardians of the Dawn to join the Military Intelligence Directorate-affiliated the Desert Commandos Regiment sometime in May 2016. * Intervention Regiment: The personal militia of Fadi Abd al-Massih Khouri, formed in September 2015. * Lions of Dwel‚Äôa (\\"Usud Dwel‚Äôa\\"): A self-defense group from the Dwel‚Äôa neighbourhood of Damascus.

He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M; University, followed by an MBA from Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. Career =Exxon= Woods joined Exxon in 1992. He had worked for Exxon for 24 years prior to being promoted to CEO following Rex Tillerson's nomination by President Donald Trump to be the next United States Secretary of State. While his predecessor was involved in deal making and exploration, Woods is a veteran of the refining side of the oil business. Prior to becoming CEO, Woods ran the refining and chemical divisions of the company, which delivered the majority of ExxonMobil's $7.8 billion net income in 2016. At an investor meeting in New York in 2017, Woods outlined his growth plan including drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico and the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota. He also spoke briefly about the company's operations in Russia, expressing an optimistic outlook regarding Exxon's Sakhalin project on Russia‚Äôs eastern coast. Positions Woods has publicly endorsed the Paris climate accord. The accord commits nations to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In May 2017, Woods wrote a personal letter to President Trump to urge that the U.S. remain a party to the agreement. He says that by remaining a party to the accords the U.S. will have a seat at the table to \\"ensure a level playing field\\" and support \\"the most cost-effective greenhouse gas reduction options\\". On October 5, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Exxon was set to increase its annual carbon emissions by about 17%, or about as much as the annual output of Greece. The emissions expansion would be built off an investment plan reportedly signed off by Woods. He has said that the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has \\"shattered the Peak Oil myth\\".

They succeeded the Tanukhids, who were dominant in the 4th century, and were in turn defeated and replaced by the Ghassanids in the early 6th century. The Salihids were originally concentrated in the Sirhan Valley and Balqa regions, but spread as far as northern Syria after entering the service of the Byzantine Empire. The Salihids were charged with collecting tax from Bedouins seeking to dwell in the Limes Arabicus and protecting the Byzantine frontier from Bedouin raiders from the Arabian Peninsula and the Syrian Desert. The Salihids were ardent Christians, and at least one of their phylarchs and kings, Dawud, built a Christian monastery, Deir Dawud. Sources The Salihid period is far more obscure than the preceding Tanukhid period (4th century) and the later Ghassanid period (6th century) due to a scarcity of available sources. The sole Greek source that mentioned the tribe, namely its royal Zokomid household, was Sozomen (d. ca. 450 CE); the latter has been described as \\"valuable for writing the history of the Arab foederati in both the fourth and fifth centuries\\", according to modern historian Irfan Shah√Æd.Shahid, p. 243. Arabic sources describing the Salihids are likewise scant, with the exception of the medieval Arab historian Hisham ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819), who documented the tribe's genealogy and some of its history in Jamharat al-Nasab.Shahid, p. 235. Unlike his documentation of other Arab tribes, Hisham did not receive his information directly from Salihid tribesmen, because few if any remained in his lifetime; instead, most of his information came from tribes who had interacted with the Salihids, namely the Ghassanids, the Banu Kalb and Kindah.Shahid, p. 236. When taken together with another Greek source, the 6th- century Theophanes of Byzantium, who mentions the rise of the Ghassanids, Hisham's account is given further credence.Shahid, pp. 243‚Äì244. Most other references to the Salihids in Arabic sources derive from Hisham's work. For the fall of the Salihids, the al-Mu·∏•abbar, written by Hisham's pupil Ibn Habib, is considered the most important source,Shahid, p 283. while the Tarikh of Ya'qubi is considered \\"most valuable for its onomastic and toponymic precision\\", determining \\"the period of Salih's fall\\" and \\"the terms of the foedus\\" between the Salihids' Ghassanid successors and the Byzantines.Shahid, p. 285. The works of the 10th-century historian Hamza al-Isfahani also contribute details to the reconstruction of the Salihids' fall. Genealogy The genealogy of the Salihids is highly obscure, though a scholarly consensus holds that they ultimately derived from the Quda'a tribal group.Shahid, p. 244. Tribes of the Quda'a had been settled in the Oriens (Byzantine Syria) and northern Arabia since ancient times. In Arabic sources, the Salihids refer to the tribe, while the Daja'ima refers to the tribe's royal household during Byzantine rule. As documented in the Jamharat al-Nasab, the Salihids' genealogical connection to Quda'a was the following: Salƒ´·∏• ibn ·∏§ulwƒÅn ibn  øImran ibn Il·∏•afƒ´ ibn Qu·∏çƒÅ øa.Shahid, p. 244, n. 57. The actual name of Salƒ´·∏•, the tribe's namesake and progenitor, was  øAmr.Shahid, p. 253. The founder of the Zokomid (·∏åaja øima) household was ·∏åu øjum ibn Sa æd ibn Salƒ´·∏•. History =Origins= According to medieval Arabic sources, prior to their entry into the Oriens, the Salihids had been established in the northern Arabian Peninsula.Shahid, p. 246. The medieval Arab historian Umar ibn Shabba reported that as early as the 3rd century, the Salihids had allied with the Palmyrene Empire and were settled by the latter in the manƒÅ·∫ìir al-ShƒÅm (watchtowers of the Limes Arabicus, the Byzantine‚ÄìArabian frontier) between Balqa (central Transjordan) and Huwwarin.Shahid, p. 249. Most sources point to an original migration from Wadi Sirhan, a valley whose northern end opened into the Byzantine province of Arabia Petraea.Shahid, p. 247. This valley was also home to the Salihids' Quda'a kinsmen, the Banu Kalb, making it more plausible that the Salihids entered Oriens from Wadi Sirhan. The Salihids' first settlements in the Limes Arabicus and their main power base were likely in the provinces of Arabia, Palaestina Salutaris and Phoenice Libanensis, all situated in the southern Levant.Shahid, p. 251. According to Shahid, this was the natural area where a tribe entering Byzantine territory from Wadi Sirhan would settle; moreover, this was the region where the foederati were most needed by the Byzantines in the 5th century as the peace with the Sasanian Empire left only the Arabian Peninsula as the most likely source for hostile forces to the empire. =Rise= The precise period in which the Salihids, or more specifically, their Zokomid ruling house, dominated the Arab foederati of the Byzantine Empire is not ascertainable. According to historian Warwick Ball, the Salihids became Byzantium's chief Arab ally by the end of the 4th century following the decline of the Tanukhids, whose power and favor deteriorated particularly as a result of a failed revolt in 383.Ball, p. 108. It is apparent that their heyday was between the reigns of emperors Arcadius (395‚Äì408) and Anastasius (489‚Äì518). The founder of the Zokomid household, Zokomos, known in Arabic as ·∏§amƒÅ·π≠a and nicknamed ·∏åuj øum (the mighty) was already a powerful tribal figure before his service with Byzantium.Shahid, p. 254. Sozomen indicated that Zokomos became a phylarch under the Byzantines and converted to Christianity along with \\"all his subjects\\" after \\"a certain monk of great celebrity\\" prophesied the birth of his son on condition of embracing the Christian faith.Shahid, pp. 253.‚Äì254. Zokomos bore two sons, 'Amr and 'Awf. The former may have been the aforementioned prophesied son because his name signifies a good omen. This son founded the less important branch of the Zokomid household and according to speculation by Shahid, may have founded the monastery of Dayr 'Amr to the north of Jerusalem, which is currently a Christian locality known by the same name.Shahid, p. 255. 'Amr gave birth to Mundhir, of whom nothing is known but his name. 'Awf had a son named 'Amr, who begat HabƒÅla, Hab≈´la (possibly the same person) and ·∏§awthara.Shahid, p. 257. Nothing is known about 'Awf's son and grandsons. However, the offspring of Mundhir and 'Amr ibn 'Awf's grandsons have been documented to varying extents. They were the last generation of Zokomid/Salihid phylarchs. Habala/Habula's son Dawud was the best-known Salihid phylarch and king, largely due to the short biography of him in the Jamharat al-Nasab. The latter says of Dawud the following: > And he was a king who used to engage in raiding expeditions. Then he became > a Christian, repented, loathed the shedding of blood, and followed the > religious life. He built a monastery and used to carry the water and the > mortar on his back, saying 'I do not want anyone to help me,' and so his > clothes became wet, and he was nicknamed al-Lathiq, 'the bedraggled.' When > he became averse to bloodshedding and killing, his position weakened and he > became himself the target of raids until he was killed by Tha ølaba ibn  øƒÄmir > al-Akbar and Mu øawiya ibn ·∏§ujayr. ‚Äî Jamharat al-Nasab by Hisham ibn al-Kalbi According to Shahid, the Jamharat's statement that Dawud converted to Christianity \\"must be a mistake\\" since the Zokomids had already been Christians since the time of Zokomos around 400 CE.Shahid, p. 258. However, the statement about Dawud's newfound piety \\"is correct and cannot be viewed with suspicion\\". Dawud's name, which is Arabic for \\"David\\", is unique among the Salihids, and their Tanukhid and Ghassanid predecessors and successors, respectively, in that it was biblical and not Arabic. This indicated that Dawud or his father were evidently attached to biblical tradition or the Israelite king David in particular. Dawud was the builder of a monastery bearing his name, Dayr Dawud, in northern Syria, between Resafa and Ithriya.Shahid, p. 262. Prior to becoming the Salihid king and phylarch, Dawud was considered a jarrƒÅr (commander of one thousand [warriors]) or chiliarch, according to Hisham's pupil Ibn Habib.Shahid, p. 258, n. 123. As indicated in the Jamharat and in a poetic verse composed by Dawud's anonymous daughter, Dawud was slain by Tha'laba ibn 'Amir and Mu'awiya ibn Hujayr, chieftains from the brother tribes of Banu Kalb and Banu Namir ibn Wabara, respectively.Shahid, p. 160. According to Shahid, it is clear that Dawud's killers were from allied tribes seeking to weaken the dominant Salihids. From Dawud's daughter's verse, it is also apparent that the battle took place between al-Qurnatayn (modern al-Shaykh Saad) in the Hawran and Mount Harib in the Golan Heights. Dawud's death, without recorded progeny, was a major contributor to the Salihids' ultimate downfall.Shahid, p. 261. Furthermore, the Emperor Leo I the Thracian's incorporation of a large Salihid contingent in his expedition against the Vandals in North Africa significantly weakened Salihid power because the contingent was annihilated in battle. Dawud's cousin or brother, Ziyad, may have succeeded Dawud as phylarch when the latter took up a religious life or died. He too was a jarrar, according to Ibn Habib, and participated in the battle of al-BaradƒÅn, which most likely was a spring in the vast Samawah desert between Syria and southern Iraq.Shahid, pp. 262‚Äì263. After an initial success during the battle, the battle turned in the favor of the opposing Kinda tribe led by Akil al-Murar Hujr, and Ziyad was slain.Shahid, p. 263. Shahid asserts it was not Akil al-Murar Hujr, who apparently died in the early or mid-5th century, but his great-grandson Hujr ibn Harith, who is said by the Byzantine sources to have attacked the Limes Arabicus, and presumably the Salihid guardians of that frontier, in circa 500.Shahid, p. 264. =Fall to the Ghassanids= Another Zokomid, Sabƒ´·π≠ ibn al-Mundhir, served as a jƒÅbƒ´ (tax collector), charged with collecting taxes from the Arab tribes in Oriens on behalf of the Byzantine authorities.Shahid, p. 256. He may have been delegated this authority by King Dawud. This was significant, according to Shahid, because it sheds light on the \\"functions of the Arab phylarchs of Byzantium: they not only fought but also collected taxes for the empire from their fellow Arabs\\". Sabit was slain by the deaf, one-eyed Ghassanid chieftain, Jid ø ibn  øAmr, when Sabit attempted to collect the tax from the Ghassanids.Shahid, p. 255. This act ignited the Salihid‚ÄìGhassanid war that ended with a Ghassanid victory and their subsequent supremacy over the Arab federate tribes of Byzantium. The Ghassanids had crossed the Limes Arabicus around 490 and were obliged to pay tribute to the Salihid guardians of the Limes.Shahid, pp. 282‚Äì283. The terms of the Ghassanids' tribute was, according to Ibn Habib, one dinar, a dinar and a half, and two dinars, for each Ghassanid tribesman, depending on their status.Shahid, p. 288. The killings of Dawud, Ziyad and Sabit, the Salihids' decreased strength after the 468 Vandalic campaign, and the assaults by the powerful Kindites and Ghassanids of Arabia toward the end of the 5th century, all led to the Salihids' weakened status by 502, when the Ghassanids formally became the dominant Arab federates of Byzantium.Shahid, p. 537. Afterward, Shahid indicates that the Salihids continued to operate, but were demoted.Shahid, p. 301. Between 502 and 529, they likely constituted one of many Arab foederati and directly answered to the dux (governor) of their province or the magister militum per Orientem (commander of the field army of Oriens).Shahid, p. 302. This period of time may have been the floruit of ·∏§ƒÅrith ibn Mandala, the last Zokomid phylarch, according to the Jamharats genealogical table.Shahid, p. 265. According to Ibn Durayd, the Tayyid poet Amir ibn Juwayn said in a poem that Harith ibn Mandala went on a raiding expedition, likely on behalf of the Byzantines, against an Arab tribe, possibly the Banu Asad, and never returned. When the Ghassanids under their king Jabala ibn al-·∏§arith were made the supreme phylarchs over all the Arab federate tribes, the Salihids became subordinate to the Ghassanids, though tensions and possibly clashes apparently persisted between them. In 580, relations between the Ghassanids and Byzantines became considerably fraught, and authority over the Arab federate tribes was again decentralized. The Salihids may have become independent of the Ghassanids as a result, and one of their phylarchs participated in the Byzantine siege of Mardin in 586. =Remnants in the Islamic era= Nothing is heard of the Salihids until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s when they fought alongside other Arab Christian federate tribes against the Muslim Arabs.Shahid, p. 304. At Dumat al-Jandal in northern Arabia, the Salihids, the Kalbids, Tanukhids and Ghassanids, were defeated by the Muslim commander Iyad ibn Ghanm. Later, this same Arab Christian alliance, boosted by the Lakhmids and the Banu Judham was defeated by the Muslim general Khalid ibn al-Walid at Ziza in Transjordan. The Salihids appear again with the Tanukhids in 638, this time in the ·∏•ƒÅdir (military encampment) of Qinnasrin; at that time, the Muslim general Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah asked the members of the ·∏•ƒÅdir to convert to Islam, but the Orthodox Christian Salihids refused. The Salihids likely dispersed throughout Bilad al-Sham (Islamic Syria) and Iraq and their clans may have joined other tribes.Shahid, p. 538. Only one Salihid, a certain UsƒÅma ibn Zayd al-Salƒ´·∏•ƒ´, attained prominence during the Islamic era. He served the Umayyad caliphs al-Walid I and Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik as their overseer of the kharaj (land tax) in Egypt and Yazid II and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik as their kƒÅtib \\"scribe\\".Shahid, encyc., p. 982. Otherwise, the Salihids' staunch Christianity rendered them isolated in the Islamic era, unlike the Tanukhids and Ghassanids, whose members and clans continued to flourish. According to various Abbasid-era geographers, members of the Salih were found living near Kufa alongside their Tayyid allies, and near Latakia. Al-Bakri, who preserved Ibn Shabba's accounts on the Salihids, reported that the Salihids' descendants still inhabited al-Balqa and Huwwarin at the time Ibn Shabba wrote his work in 876. =Modern era= In modern-day Jordan (al-Balqa), the ancient Salihi presence is attested to various places: the village of al-Salƒ´·∏•ƒ´ about 20 kilometers northwest of Amman, the  øAyn al-Salƒ´·∏•ƒ´ spring and the WƒÅdƒ´ al- Salƒ´·∏•ƒ´ valley. Moreover, in the vicinity of these places lives the al-Salƒ´·∏•ƒÅt (Slei·∏•at) tribe; Shahid asserts that the latter are \\"almost certainly, because of the rarity of the name, the descendants of the ancient Salƒ´·∏•ids\\".

She is the project director of Border Green Energy Team (BGET) and the CEO and founder of the company SunSawang, making green energy systems available to remote populations. She received a 2014 Cartier Women's Initiative Award for her work providing renewable energy to remote areas in Thailand. Education Salinee Tavaranan grew up on the island of Phuket, located in southern Thailand. She received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Chulalongkorn University in Thailand in 2001. She then earned a master's degree in solar energy engineering from the University of Massachusetts in 2003. Career Salinee Tavaranan had just started a Ph.D. program when she was offered the job of project director with Border Green Energy Team (BGET). She returned to Thailand to join the project. Border Green is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which works with villagers to install green energy systems utilizing solar, micro-hydro power, and biogas. One of the reasons for training local villagers is that areas may not be reachable in the rainy season. BGET has worked with refugees at the Mae La refugee camp near the border between Thailand and Burma as well as villagers in remote areas. This work enabled people to gain access to much needed resources including water, lights, classrooms with computers, medics and health care resources. In 2004, the Thai government had supported an initiative to install solar home systems in nearly 300,000 Thai households in remote areas which did not have access to the national energy grid. Follow-up research by the United Nations Development Programme several years later showed that 80% of the systems had not been maintained and were no longer used. In 2011, BGET carried out a 300-person pilot program to test the feasibility of providing solar energy products and maintenance services for a fee, in an attempt to develop a more sustainable model for local green energy development. In March 2013, Salinee Tavaranan created her startup SunSawang to provide maintenance services for solar powered systems. The company recruits and trains local technicians who maintain the equipment provided by the previous government initiative. Expensive photovoltaic panels are generally salvageable and are reused with relatively inexpensive components such as micro-hydro turbines, solar-powered lanterns and cell phone chargers. Initially higher starting costs are balanced against lower ongoing costs by offering five-year payment plans. As of 2014, the company focused on working with inhabitants in the Tak region, an area of forests and national parks near the Thai-Burmese border. Salinee Tavaranan continues to work to some extent with BGET as well as with SunSawang. She received one of the Cartier Women's Initiative Awards in 2014 for her work providing renewable energy to remote areas in Thailand.

He joined the law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman (then known as Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson & Torres) in 1994, where he met and represented Donald Trump, then chairman and president of The Trump Organization. He served as an advisor to Trump during his successful presidential campaign. In December 2016, President-elect Trump's transition team announced that Friedman was Trump's nominee for ambassador. His nomination was met with support from conservative Israeli and Jewish American activist groups, and opposition from liberal advocacy organizations, particularly J Street. He was confirmed by the full Senate on March 23, 2017, with a 52‚Äì46 vote, officially sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on March 29 and presented his credentials on May 15. Friedman with Israeli politician Bezalel Smotrich Early life and education Friedman was one of four children born to Morris S. Friedman (d. 2005), a Temple Hillel rabbi and Addi Friedman, a high school English teacher. He grew up in North Woodmere, New York. His father was a rabbi at Temple Hillel, a Conservative synagogue in North Woodmere, and served as the head of the New York Board of Rabbis. He graduated from Hebrew Academy of Nassau County (HANC) high school in 1974, and earned his B.A. degree in anthropology from Columbia University, graduating in 1978, and his J.D. degree from New York University School of Law, graduating in 1981. He has been a member of the New York State Bar Association since 1982. Legal and philanthropic career In 1994, he left the now-defunct law firm Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon to form the bankruptcy practice at Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson & Torres. Friedman was promoted to name partner in 1995, and the firm was renamed Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman. As the head of the creditors' rights and bankruptcy practice group, Friedman advised and represented Donald Trump and The Trump Organization in bankruptcies involving his Atlantic City casinos. Friedman volunteered to head American Friends of Bet El Institutions, an organization that advocates against a two- state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and provides around $2 million per year to the Israeli settlement Bet El. The organization also received donations from the family foundation of Jared Kushner, Trump's son- in-law. In 1999, Friedman dedicated the Friedman Faculty House. The settlement runs the Israeli news website Arutz Sheva, where Friedman is a columnist. In his writings and statements, Friedman repeatedly argued in support of Israeli settlements, declaring them legal. He has also contributed to United Hatzalah (\\"united rescue\\"), an Israeli organization that provides emergency medical services, and Aleh Negev, a village for disabled Bedouin and Jewish people in southern Israel. Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign Friedman advised Trump on Israel-related and Jewish issues during his presidential campaign, co-chairing Trump's Israel Advisory Committee along with Jason D. Greenblatt, an executive vice president for The Trump Organization. During the presidential election, he donated a total of $50,000 to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. Four days prior to the election, Friedman and Greenblatt released a joint statement promising to move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, one of Trump's campaign promises. Other presidential candidates, including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Hillary Clinton, had also promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem during their campaigns. Moving the embassy would be a significant departure from U.S. policy. Since the end of the Six-Day War in 1967, the U.S. officially maintained that Jerusalem's final status should be decided by direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians; it did not recognize Jerusalem as Israeli territory. Relocation would be in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, passed by Congress in 1995, which required moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by May 31, 1999. The executive branch has consistently waived implementation of the act, arguing it would have a negative impact on national security. On June 1, 2017, in accordance with his predecessors, President Trump signed an executive order keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv instead of relocating it to Jerusalem. However, on December 6, 2017, President Trump reversed course and issued a \\"Presidential Proclamation Recognizing Jerusalem as the Capital of the State of Israel and Relocating the United States Embassy to Israel to Jerusalem.\\" Nomination for U.S. Ambassador to Israel = Reactions = On December 15, 2016, the transition team of President-elect Donald Trump announced that Friedman had been selected to be the nominee as the United States Ambassador to Israel. Friedman's nomination was controversial; some American Jewish, Israeli, and Palestinian individuals and advocacy groups argued against his nomination. Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, said that moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and annexing West Bank settlements would lead to the \\"destruction of the peace process\\" and send the region down a path of \\"chaos, lawlessness, and extremism\\". Friedman had said in an interview for Haaretz during the campaign that Trump would be open to Israel annexing parts of the West Bank. The U.S. has opposed Israeli settlements in the West Bank since 1967. The liberal advocacy organization J Street \\"vehemently opposed\\" Friedman's nomination. During the presidential campaign, Friedman had attacked J Street supporters, writing in Arutz Sheva in May 2016: > Are J Street supporters really as bad as kapos? The answer, actually, is no. > They are far worse than kapos‚ÄîJews who turned in their fellow Jews in the > Nazi death camps. The kapos faced extraordinary cruelty and who knows what > any of us would have done under those circumstances to save a loved one? But > J Street? They are just smug advocates of Israel's destruction delivered > from the comfort of their secure American sofas‚Äîit's hard to imagine anyone > worse. When asked about his comments on J Street at the Saban Forum in early December, Friedman had stood by his statements, saying that J Street supporters were \\"not Jewish, and they're not pro-Israel\\". The advocacy organizations Americans for Peace Now, Ameinu, the Israel Policy Forum, and the New Israel Fund also opposed the nomination. Six Democratic members of the House of Representatives, including Jewish representatives Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, John Yarmuth, and Steve Cohen, urged their colleagues in the Senate to vote against Friedman. Five former United States Ambassadors to Israel ‚Äì Thomas Pickering, William Harrop, Edward Walker Jr., Daniel Kurtzer, and James Cunningham ‚Äì signed a letter declaring Friedman unqualified. Other Jewish and Israeli groups and individuals supported Friedman's nomination. Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union, commended Trump for the nomination as a change in the relationship between Israel and the United States from the relationship under the Obama administration. Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, said Friedman \\"has the potential to be the greatest US Ambassador to Israel ever\\". The Republican Jewish Coalition and Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, founder and president of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, both supported the nomination. Israeli politicians Tzipi Hotovely, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dani Dayan, the Consul General of Israel in New York, and Minister of Education Naftali Bennett all praised Friedman and welcomed his nomination. The Yesha Council, the umbrella organization governing West Bank settlements, also supported the nomination, saying Friedman had a \\"deep love for all of the land and people of Israel, including those in Judea and Samaria,\\" the Biblical names of the area of land which is referred to internationally as the West Bank. = Senate confirmation = David Friedman is sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence. Friedman's confirmation hearing was held on February 16, 2017. The hearing was contentious; protesters from Americans Muslims for Palestine and the Jewish group IfNotNow were arrested after interrupting the proceedings several times. Friedman said he believed a two-state solution is the best way to resolve the conflict. He had previously questioned the need for it, stating as a representative for the Trump campaign, \\"a two-state solution is not a priority ... A two-state solution is a way, but it's not the only way.\\" He had also called it a \\"scam\\" and a \\"damaging anachronism\\" in a February 2016 column for Arutz Sheva. He also agreed to sell off his business interests in the region and end his support for the expansion of Israeli settlements. He apologized for his past language towards J Street, maintaining his differences of opinion with the organization. Yael Patir, the Israel director of J Street, did not accept the apology. Several Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized Friedman's fitness for the position, while the Republican members generally expressed their support. On March 9, 2017, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his nomination in a 12‚Äì9 vote. All Republicans voted in favor, along with Democrat Bob Menendez from New Jersey. Friedman was officially confirmed on March 23. All Democratic and independent senators except Bob Menendez and Joe Manchin, from West Virginia, voted against him. 50 out of 52 Republican senators voted for him; two Republicans did not vote. On March 29, Vice President Mike Pence officially administered the oath of office, swearing in Friedman. He succeeded Leslie Tsou, who served as the interim charg√© d'affaires after Daniel Shapiro left the position on January 20. Ambassadorship David Friedman, fourth from right in the front row of in Beit HaNassi (the President's Residence of Israel), during Donald Trump's visit to Israel, May 2017 Friedman became the U.S. ambassador to Israel on May 15, 2017 when he presented his credentials to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. In 2019, The Jerusalem Post listed him as one of the world's 50 most influential Jews. Personal life Friedman is an Orthodox Jew and is fluent in Hebrew. He has been married to his wife, Tammy Deborah Sand, since 1981. They have five children and seven grandchildren. Friedman's daughter, Talia Friedman, immigrated to Israel and officially became an Israeli citizen on August 15, 2017. In 1984, Friedman met President Ronald Reagan when Reagan visited Temple Hillel. Reagan was the first sitting president since George Washington to visit a synagogue. Friedman became friends with Donald Trump in 2005, after Trump paid him a condolence call during his sitting shiva for his father.

The IGLTA Foundation also supports scholarships for students and small business owners to attend the annual IGLTA Global Convention. Trump Controversy On July 5, 2015, the IGLTA sent an email to its members announcing the addition of its newest member businesses. The email included three Trump-branded properties: Trump SoHo New York, Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago and Trump International Hotel & Tower New York. This was not the first time the IGLTA had included Trump-branded properties. A Change.org petition dating to 2011 encouraged the organization to \\"Dump Trump Properties\\". On July 7, 2017, the IGLTA gave an official statement to the Windy City Times, IGLTA President/CEO John Tanzella said, \\"IGLTA is a member- based travel association promoting LGBTQ friendly travel options. IGLTA also aims to support and educate businesses that want to better respond to the needs of LGBTQ clients. \\"The Trump branded properties which are current members of IGLTA (2017) are independently owned hotels and not owned by Mr. Trump.\\" Donald Trump has spoken out against LGBT Rights and Same-Sex Marriage. As President of the United States, he was the first President since George W. Bush to not acknowledge June as Pride Month. Few people have expressed concern surrounding the topic, despite the differences between the President of the United States and non-affiliated, privately owned, LGBTQ-friendly travel accommodations.

The series features characters from various animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera, such as Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, The Herculoids, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles and Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor. Premise Official premise by DC Comics: When the adventurous and inquisitive Jonny Quest and his adoptive brother Hadji make a startling discovery in the swamplands of Florida, they are pulled into an epic struggle between the Space Rangers and a dangerous villain who threatens the galaxy. Now it‚Äôs up to the combined forces of Team Quest, Inter-Nation Security, Space Ghost, and a host of Hanna-Barbera‚Äôs greatest action heroes to stop him and save their universe! Story On a distant planet, an intergalactic police force known as the Space Force give their lives to stop a creature called Omnikron. There is one survivor, later revealed to be Space Ghost. In the swamplands of Palm Key, Florida, Doctor Quest is tracking mysterious phenomena such as unnatural storms, and glimpses into other areas of the galaxy known as vortexes. He is met by Inter-Nation Security representatives Ray Randall, and Deva Sumadi. Space Ghost's Phantom Cruiser unexpectedly crash lands, and Jonny Quest, Hadji, and Race Bannon are sent to investigate. A terrorist organization known as F.E.A.R., led by frequent Quest enemy Doctor Zin, appear in the swamplands, with the intention of recovering the cruiser and killing the Quest team. Race is shot down, and Jonny and Hadji are nearly captured, but escape with the help of a boy that introduces himself as Ty. Ray Randall reveals himself to be Birdman and rushes to the site. With the help of Race Bannon, they rescue Jonny, Hadji, Ty, an amnesiac girl from the ship, and a strange monkey. F.E.A.R. excavates the cruiser, recover a second survivor from the crash, and leave Palm Key. Back at the Quest compound, Deva tells Ty it is safer he remain under Inter-Nation's protection, as he will now be a target of F.E.A.R. Soon, Team Quest, Birdman, Deva, Ty, the mysterious girl from the ship, and her pet monkey take off for Brazil, as Doctor Quest projects a large vortex will take place there. They arrive, and are met by Todd Messick, young adventurer whose parents mysteriously disappeared in the area they landed in, known as the \\"Lost Valley\\". They walk to an archeological excavation site which tells the legend of Mightor. They discover F.E.A.R. arrived to the site first, led by mercenary Jezebel Jade. In the struggle, Mightor's club is discovered, and Ty grabs it, transforming him into Mightor. Ty's transformation gives the team the upper hand, leading F.E.A.R. to retreat, but Doctor Quest is captured by Jade. Jonny, Hadji, Race, Deva, and the girl from the crash (who has remembered her name is Jan) leave the Lost Valley, and turn to old ally Doctor Linda Conroy, mother of Buzz Conroy, and builder of Frankenstein, Jr. Meanwhile, Mightor begins training under Birdman. They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Omnikron, and they become trapped in a vortex. Back at Doctor Conroy's lab, Doctor Conroy reveals her latest project, Gargantuan, her largest robot, built to handle cataclysmic situations without endangering human life. It has a body, but lacks the protocols to be considered artificial intelligence. Omnikron appears at the Hollywood Bowl, where the Impossibles are stationed by Inter-Nation. Deva, convinced the Impossibles are not prepared to face such a threat, takes off to California with Race Bannon and Doctor Conroy, instructing the kids to stay in the lab. The Impossibles prepare to face Omnikron, but just before it appears, it spits out a nearly-dead Space Ghost. Before falling unconscious, he instructs the Impossibles not to let Omnikron touch anyone. Meanwhile, at the lab, Jan recovers her memory, and tells Jonny, Hadji, and Buzz that Omnikron is a massive intergalactic parasite that feeds off of life, and destroys entire ecosystems. She also tells them about the fallen Space Force, and that she is being trained by Space Ghost to be the next generation of the Space Force. They figure out that no one on Earth knows what they are up against, and that Omnikron would just feed off of any resistance. Jonny suggests activating Gargantuan, but it lacks protocols. Buzz comes to the solution of inputting Frankenstein Jr.'s brain into the body of Gargantuan. They merge the brain and body, and take off for California. At the F.E.A.R. base, Doctor Quest is being held prisoner, but Doctor Zin admits he needs Doctor Quest to help him save the Earth from annihilation. Doctor Zin reveals he has been secretly controlling the F.E.A.R. leader, Number One, with mind control, and the boy he recovered from the crash site, was Jan's brother Jace. Jace warned Doctor Zin of the incoming threat, causing Zin to have a change of heart, wishing to have helped fight Omnikron, instead of using it. They are about to leave the F.E.A.R. base to join the fray in California, but Number One has overcome Zin's control and intends to use Zin and Quest to come up with a solution, and to auction it off when the world becomes desperate enough. Jezebel Jade betrays Number 1, and help Doctor Quest and Doctor Zin escape with the Phantom Cruiser. Jace regains consciousness, and tells them he needs to find his sister Jan. The Impossibles struggle to keep civilians away from Omnikron, and soon the Phantom Cruiser arrives, and Space Ghost is placed in a healing chamber within the Cruiser. Frankenstein, Jr., carrying Jonny, Hadji, and Jan also arrives to help fight off Omnikron. The odds turn even more in the heroes' favor when Birdman and Mightor escape from the vortex, joining the fight. The surviving Herculoids (who went missing fighting Omnikron weeks ago) also emerge from the vortex, but distrustful of robots, attack Frankenstein, Jr. Omnikron flees to space via vortex, and Mightor follows it through the vortex thinking he could finish off Omnikron. The heroes regroup at an Inter- Nation base, and formulate a plan to defeat Omnikron. Mightor, having relied on Birdman's power to guide the inside of a vortex, is unable to escape again. He is thrown 45 thousand years into the past, and meets the original Mightor. The original Mightor says he has happy the club did not fall into the hands of the \\"Sky-god\\" (Omnikron), and teaches him to open a vortex to any location he is familiar with. Mightor uses his newfound power, and joins all the other heroes at the base. Tarra of the Herculoids expresses remorse and shame for ordering the Herculoids to attack Frankenstein, Jr., but Doctor Conroy, impressed by the Herculoids' tactics, expresses gratitude in being able to improve on flaws the Herculoids exploited. Space Ghost, fully healed, reveals himself to have been spying on the other heroes to formulate a plan. Space Ghost, Birdman, and some of the Herculoids then attack the F.E.A.R. base Doctor Quest was being held at to recruit help. In the Grand Canyon, one of the Herculoids, who has a telepathic connection to its cell twin that merged with Omnikron weeks ago, is able to pinpoint Omnikron's location. Multi-Man of the Impossibles creates the illusion of a massively clustered population in the Grand Canyon to bait Omnikron into returning to Earth. Mightor opens a vortex to Omnikron's location, and Birdman traces a path from that location to Multi-Man's illusion, and this causes Omnikron to take the bait and return to Earth in the Grand Canyon. The Impossibles and the Herculoids (both immune to Omnikron's absorption due to their bodies being more of an alloy) enter Omnikron, attempting to reach the core. The F.E.A.R. Spider-bots, Space Ghost, Race Bannon, Deva, and Frankenstein Jr. are fighting Omnikron from the outside. The Impossibles and the Herculoids reach the core, and launch a neuro-control device into the core, with Doctor Quest, Doctor Zin, and Doctor Conroy synced to the device shot into Omnikron's core. They were to keep Omnikron from escaping. Omnikron is able to psychologically able to overpower the scientists, so Jonny Quest and Hadji take it upon themselves to keep Omnikron from escaping. They too go through psychological challenges, but are able to boost each other's confidence, and take control of Omnikron. The heroes take advantage of this, and Mightor opens a vortex just outside Earth's atmosphere, and Space Ghost, Jan, and Jace fly through, and blast Omnikron into the Sun with the Phantom Cruiser. The heroes celebrate, and Birdman says the boys were able to take control by not holding onto psychological demons adults hang onto. Space Ghost returns to his galaxy to spread the good news, and rebuild the Space Force, while the Herculoids reunite with the others that did not go missing. On Earth, the other heroes have a party, and Ty asks Jonny and Hadji if he dreamed all this, and Jonny expresses his gratitude that he made new friends.

The nearby Big Muddy oil field brought prosperity to Glenrock, stimulating the growth of the town's commercial district. The building was built for the Glenrock Investment Company, a consortium of local investors, by Edward R. Reavill. The building housed the Glenrock State Bank until 1934. Other businesses in the building included a bar, a billiard parlor and a drug store. The Empress Theater took a two-story space in the east wing of the block. By the late 1920s the oil boom had ended and the theater passed through several owners, closing intermittently. In 1939 it was renamed the Wyoma Theater and had a prominent marquee. with The second floor of the block was occupied by a variety of professional offices and Commerce Hall, a community meeting room. A fire in 1978 damaged the building, leaving it almost vacant into the early 21st century. Description The two-story brick building is rectangular in plan, measuring about by , facing Fourth Street. The block follows the slope of the Fourth Street grade. Prominent terra cotta medallions are placed at the center of the two main facades, both with \\"The Commerce Block\\" incised. The interior has been altered to various degrees. The former bank retains its mezzanine and woodwork. The drugstore has a pressed metal ceiling in the front portion with original light fixtures. The theater is intact, with seats removed, and its marquee remains. A basement underlies the building with utility spaces. Much of the second floor was gutted following the fire. The Commerce Block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 2005. Following its listing it was purchased and renovated by the town of Glenrock.

was an American college football bowl game played on January 1, 1952, at Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. It was the seventh annual playing of the Gator Bowl. The game pitted the Miami Hurricanes against the Clemson Tigers Background The Hurricanes, after losing their first game of the season to Tulane, won the next four games to lean into the AP rankings at #19 before facing #14 Kentucky. However, a 32‚Äì0 loss in Kentucky dropped them out of the rankings, though they did win three of their final four games to finish with seven regular season victories, a slight drop from the nine the previous season. This was their third bowl game in six years and first bowl game appearance outside of the Orange Bowl. Clemson won the first three games of the season to rise to #16 in the polls before a matchup with #20 Pacific dropped them out, with a loss to South Carolina twelve days later making them 3‚Äì2. The Tigers would rebound to win their final four regular season games to finish 5th in the Southern Conference while finishing their fourth consecutive season .500 or better. This was their third bowl game in four seasons and second Gator bowl in three years. Game summary Harry Mellios scored two touchdowns for Miami (the first from 11 yards out and the second from 2 yards out) in the first half, with the scores proving to be the difference in a game dominated by stagnation. Miami won the game despite having less first downs (5 to Clemson's 14), less rushing yards (119 to the Tigers' 145), less passing yards (55 to Clemson's 88), and more penalties and punts (four for 30 yards and 9 punts for 44.5 yards average). However, it was the four interceptions thrown by Clemson quarterback Billy Hair (all caught by MVP Jim Dooley, who played both offense and defense) that proved crucial to the victory. Aftermath Clemson left the Southern Conference after the game, joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. They were not invited to a bowl game again until 1957, with the next Gator Bowl appearance not being until 1977. Miami was not invited to another bowl game until 1961 (though they did finish 6th ranked in the AP Poll in 1956). Their next Gator Bowl appearance would not be until 2000.

More specifically, the characters operate in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. The story primarily concerns the Turkish migrant Ali who is illegally in Germany trying to find work, Frau Gramke, and Brigitte Gramke who is the daughter of Frau Gramke and Bruno Gramke.  Historical context  The beginning of the Guest Worker program in Germany started with the postwar labor recruitment treaty. The Federal Republic of Germany signed a treaty with Italy in 1955 which defined what a ‚Äúguest‚Äù worker or Gastarbeiter is and the application process that allowed them to enter the country. Guest Worker programs came about due to the high labor demand from industrialized economies of Western Europe and the excess labor supply from less industrialized countries. Germany received mainly Turkish workers, which promised them more work opportunities that would lead to upward mobility. The treaty between Turkey and Germany was signed on September 1, 1961, when Turkey was struggling to sort through political conflict. At first, these workers were gladly accepted by German society, but the demand for workers wasn‚Äôt being fulfilled fast enough and Germany threatened to seek laborers from other countries. Many Turkish workers failed to pass the recruitment process, which included a medical check-up, and those who did pass could not bring their families with them. Although accepted in the beginning, in more recent years the Turkish workers are described as un-assimilated, and there is a growing animosity towards the group of people that some even describe as reminiscent of the feelings towards Jews in pre-war Germany. √ñren‚Äôs work is a part of a subgenre of literature dealing with the Turkish migrant‚Äôs experience in Germany. This genre of literature has been labeled Gastarbeiterliteratur and has had over 1,100 works written on this content in the past thirty five years. This genre focuses on the interpretation of recruitment practices, competitions, appropriations, and movements through many different media from poetic critiques, to the celebration of multicultural identities.  Major characters  = Brigitte = The sixteen-year-old daughter of Frau Gramke and Bruno Gramke. She doesn‚Äôt have a good relationship with her parents. She struggles with what direction to take her life. = Frau Gramke = A 52-year-old woman who cleans offices for a living and used to work as a rubble clearing woman. She is married to Bruno Gramke, who does not have a job. They have lived in their apartment for nine years. = Ali Itir = A Turkish immigrant living illegally in Germany. His passport was marked as 'Tourist' when he entered the country, so he cannot officially work and struggles with finding a job. He lives with his cousins while he tries to find work that he can be paid for under the table.  Summary  The novel opens with Frau Gramke waking up from a dream about a white flower, which gave her a sort of pleasure. She wakes up to her husband Bruno Gramke still sleeping who still has the smell of beer on him. While he is sleeping he is dreaming about trying to reach West Berlin, which to him would mean that all of his problems would go away and he would find a job. When Frau Gramke gets out of bed she trips on trash that she blames her daughter, Brigitte, for leaving around. Frau Gramke wakes up her daughter, who is sleeping on the couch, in order to tell her to it pick up. Both of the characters are annoyed at one another, and Brigitte refuses to wake up. Frau Gramke goes outside in order to shovel snow when her elderly neighbor who is walking his dog greets her. In return, she reluctantly greets him back and continues to shovel snow. When she returns inside, she sees the man fall but does not do anything to help him even though he is calling for help. She instead then wishes for him to freeze where he fell. Frau Gramke tries to wake up her daughter again and they trade some harsh words. Brigitte gets ready for the day reluctantly and decides not to have breakfast with her father since they fight often. The night before, she and her parents fought about how Brigitte came home too late and would never be able to get a job like her sister, who they think is a hairdresser making a lot of money but in reality is a prostitute. One of the main problems Brigitte has faced in this point in her life is whether or not to start a life of her own with her boyfriend Achim, which in her mind would eventually lead to turning into her parents the exact opposite of what she wants. She decides to go to a caf√© that she frequents often and meets with her friend Frank. They share a laugh, but Achim walks into the caf√© at this moment and is bothered by their interactions. He grabs Brigitte and takes her to a tattoo artist where he forces her to get a tattoo of a blue cross in the center of her chest. While they were waiting to enter into the building, a Turkish woman hesitates as if she were going to say something, but instead she moves on. When Brigitte gets home, she sees her tattoo in the mirror and steals 100 marks from her father. The novel switches perspectives and presents Ali Itir. He wakes up and immediately starts worrying about finding a job since there has been no jobs in the past couple of days. He lives with his cousins he calls Ibrahim and Sultan, both of whom have jobs. When he was first coming into Germany, Ali‚Äôs passport was stamped as a tourist‚Äôs would be even though he begged the officer to stamp it differently. Since his passport was stamped in this way, he cannot get a job legally, and for seven months Ali has been struggling living in the country. Even after his moving in with his relatives he still struggles with the idea that he is a burden since he doesn‚Äôt have a job. He is hopeful at the prospect of work though since the snow would need to be shoveled. That morning he went to an office that hired him under the table to shovel snow. When he enters the office the man asks him where his friends are, and Ali thinks that the police will be coming to arrest him. It is revealed that the man was just disappointed that there weren‚Äôt going to be more workers to shovel the time, but still Ali is anxious and has a flash back to when he was in the military. The man hiring him checks his passport and tells Ali to go back to the place he worked yesterday and that he would return to the office to retrieve his money and his passport. Ali almost calls the man Commander after the man tells him to start work at a specific time. After Achim dropped Brigitte off at her house, he goes to the caf√© where he had dragged Brigitte out of and drinks with his friends. When they leave, they come across the old man who had fallen earlier that morning. Recognizing him as Brigitte‚Äôs neighbor, he stops to help him up even though he and his friends think he is drunk. After a feeble attempt to pick him up, he and his friends leave thinking that the police will help him sooner or later, but the next person to encounter him is Ali. Ali was walking to work when he sees a commotion on the far side of the street. When he reaches the man who had fallen down, he stops to help, but when the man asks for the police, Ali asks the man for the police not to be involved. However, a crowd had started to gather around them and Ali starts hearing people mutter police. That is when he decides to run away from the situation. When Frau Gramke leaves their flat for work, it is unclear as to whether or not she looks in the direction of the elderly man who now has a group of people arguing around him about what to do next. Frau Gramke works cleaning offices, which is grueling work since she often gets yelled at by the workers there for not cleaning something properly. She works with a Turkish woman named Hat√ße who seems to disappear at the worst times leaving Frau Gramke to do most of the work. It isn‚Äôt until she finds Hat√ße on the toilet does she realize why. This causes a flashback to when Frau Gramke worked by cleaning up the rubble after the war. She is reminded of a woman named Hilde who was pulled out of the rubble. Hat√ße is seen to be bleeding due to an abortion that she had, and Frau Gramke wants to call a doctor even though Hat√ße refuses. A secretary eventually calls the police for her. While all of this is happening, Brigitte decides to skip work for the day, but consequently has to deal with her father. When she leaves, she sees that the caf√© she usually hangs out at is closed and decides to go to a different caf√© where she looks for jobs like her sister‚Äôs profession in the newspaper. Frau Gramke goes to the market where she gossips about her elderly neighbor. It is revealed that he was her former boss when she was a rubble woman. She thinks back to that time and remembers how all of the women bribed him with sex. His name is revealed as Ernst Kutte and Frau Gramke knew that he always liked her when they worked together. She then remembers the time when he sexually assaults her. After she is done shopping, she goes to the tavern where her husband is conversing with Her Stadtrat who is a councilman. The crowd agrees with what Bruno is saying, and Frau Gramke supports her husband in order to avoid conversing more about Kutte. The conversation then turns towards the availability of jobs and how many employers are hiring Turks instead of native Berliners. After this, there is a silence that is interrupted with news that Kutte is dead from heart failure. Ali is at work on the toilet during his break since he didn‚Äôt get enough sleep the night before. He dozes off and remembers his job as a police officer in Istanbul, but he is interrupted by knocking on the door. When his lunch break finally arrives, he is almost refused a meal because he doesn‚Äôt have a meal ticket, but a student he encountered before gave him an extra ticket. Ali and the student eat together even though Ali wants to avoid conversation. Meanwhile, Frau Gramke goes to visit the apartment of Ernst Kutte where a tobacconist opens the door. She is uneasy, but she enters the flat anyway and sees a picture of all the rubble clearing women. Brigitte isn‚Äôt at home either and is instead goes to her usual caf√©. It is there that her friends tell her that Ernst Kutte has died. While her friends fill her in on the details, a policeman is waiting for his curry sausage pretending not to hear anything. She then approaches two men in the doorway of a tavern and asks for a cigarette. One of the men is Ali, and they agree to go to her place. He would pay her 20 marks for their encounter. After their awkward intercourse, Brigitte leaves in a panic while Ali chases after to try and pay her. She then goes to the police to report the incident as a forced sexual encounter. Ali no longer has a place to stay with his cousins and tries to avoid the police at all costs. The novel ends with Frau Gramke collecting money in order to buy a wreath for Ernst Kutte. Brigitte is again at the caf√© she frequents often when a police van with a drawing of a man and a dummy wearing similar clothes to what Ali was wearing drives past. A loudspeaker announced that a body had been found dead in the Landwhr Canal, and it was unclear if it was an accident, suicide, or murder. Brigitte tells Achim that this was the man that she almost prostituted herself to, and they drive off together.

They began searching for partners and funding for the project in 2008, and entered into a joint venture with Ehrmann in September 2009. In March 2010, with investment from Ehrmann, state and federal funding, and tax incentives from the state of Vermont, the company broke ground on a $32 million processing facility in Brattleboro, Vermont. The plant began production in March 2011. In November 2012, Ehrmann Commonwealth began a $12 million expansion at the Brattleboro plant, increasing its size by from the original . The project was completed in June 2013, increasing the workforce at the facility from 110 to over 140. For 2013, the company's estimated revenue was $70 million. In October 2013, the company opened a second yogurt production plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, under the name Ehrmann Arizona Dairy. Constructed at a cost of $50 million and employing 110 people, the facility was built to distribute products to West Coast markets, while providing capacity to expand into the central United States. In December 2016, Ehrmann Commonwealth announced a second expansion project in Brattleboro, relocating administrative offices in the production facility and other areas into a new central headquarters building to allow added manufacturing space in the existing plant. The $2 million project was partially financed by public funding, including $1 million from the Windham County Economic Development program and various indirect incentives from local and state governments.

After a positive recommendation in 1913 from the U.S. Department of the Interior, a discovery well was drilled in 1916, probably by the Merritt Oil and Gas Company, yielding 26 barrels of oil per day. An oil boom ensued, with oil wasted into the North Platte River through poor preparation. The community of Parkerton was established at the field, with its own train station. The population peaked at 2500 in 1923, but Parkerton was mostly deserted by 1935. The field produces from several strata in the Big Muddy Anticline, which covers about . The Wall Creek sands are the most productive deposit, averaging between and with an average thickness of to , with 200 wells drilled by 1949. The Shannon oil stratum lies at an average depth of 1100 feet in a layer of sand. Of about 150 wells drilled in the Shannon deposit about 15 were dry. Peak production from the Shannon was 3,600,000 barrels in 1919. Later development took place in the Dakota sandstone at a depth between and . 51 wells had been drilled in the Dakota deposit by 1949 with a production of 2,436,830 barrels of API 35 green oil. The Lakota and Stray sands were exploited in later years, with 1,367,316 barrels produced by 1949 from eleven wells. Since the Lakota wells produced large quantities of water, production concentrated on Dakota wells. The Big Muddy filed produced little gas, although more gas came from the Wall Creek wells, and 549 million cubic feet of gas was produced in 1957, most of which was used locally in production work. A refinery was built by the Mutual Oil Company in 1917 near Glenrock to process Big Muddy oil. Mutual was acquired by the Continental Oil Company in the mid-1920s with most of the field. The refinery closed by 1957. The refinery and another built by Standard Oil in Glenrock and others in Casper were connected to the field by pipelines. Some of the field's wells were developed on land owned by the University of Wyoming. The \\"University Well\\" supplemented the university's income in the 1920s and helped to pay for the Half Acre Gymnasium and the Aven Nelson Library. The field had produced 37.6 million barrels of oil by 1956. Water injection began in 1953 using water from Lakota wells, with 38 injection wells by 1958.

The episode aired in the United States on Fox on January 15, 2017. It marked the first two-part episode of the series since \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" The episode is a spoof of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film version of the novel, and the 2015 Fox program Empire. Plot =Part One= Mr. Burns is reminiscing about his past, mainly how he used to hold excessive parties at his estate at Middle Hampton, Lengthy Island. Smithers suggests he throw a new one to relive the past. Mr. Burns offers to organize the entire party himself, but relents and tasks Smithers to travel to Northern Canada to get a quarter ton of lake ice for the party. Smithers meets Homer and tells him about the party, handing him invitations to distribute. Homer decides to invite his family and some random citizens of Springfield to Mr. Burns' party. The party ends up being a failure thanks to Mr. Burns planning it too cheaply. While being consoled by Homer after the party, Mr. Burns spots another party across the bay, and he gets the idea to crash it. At the party, Mr. Burns is impressed that the party is just like the ones he used to throw (though he notes that the way this party and his parties interpret the \\"white party\\" theme is very different). He then meets the host of the party, an elite hip hop artist named Jay G (Kevin Michael Richardson). Jay G is upset with the party crashers at first, but then he recognizes Mr. Burns and is excited to meet him, telling him that Mr. Burns' advice book, \\"The Rungs of Ruthlessness\\", was a major influence on his life and helped shape his Golden Goose empire. Jay G allows Mr. Burns and Homer to crash the party. The following day, Homer's family explores Middle Hampton, and while visiting an ice cream shop, a rich boy named Blake Black cuts in front of them. Upon being scolded for doing so, Blake offers to pay for everyone's cones. Lisa is at first put off by Blake's behavior, but when Blake becomes infatuated with her and wants to hang out with her, she reconsiders her judgement of him. Meanwhile, Bart, upset by these recent developments in his family's lives, meets a scented candle salesman (Keegan- Michael Key), who offers to tell him about how Jay G ruined his chance at recognition if he buys one of his candles. Bart declines, being unimpressed by the cheapest candle available. Later, Lisa is once again put off by Blake when he commits unethical methods to enhance their whale watching experience, and rejects him. Blake attempts to make up for Lisa by organizing a horse justice protest at a horse show, and just as she appears to be won over, another boy appears to offer her a chance to personally groom the horses, and she accepts, leaving Blake to lament that he redeemed himself for nothing and had to give up being a douche. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns and Jay G continue to bond, with Jay G giving Mr. Burns a special credit card with no spending limit as a gift for inspiring him. Encouraged by Jay G, Mr. Burns goes on a spending spree with his new card, until he learns that he has gone bankrupt. It turns out that Jay G had designed the card to con Mr. Burns out of his entire fortune and he joins Alicia Keys and his company mascot Goosius in laughing at his misfortune via a viral video. With all of Mr. Burns' assets absorbed into Jay G's empire, Mr. Burns finds himself at rock bottom. =Part Two= Having lost everything to Jay G, and with Smithers still in Canada, Mr. Burns finds that the only person still loyal to him is Homer. Homer consults with Marge if he should continue to work at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, which is now under Jay G's ownership, and learns that life in the Springfield Hamptons has driven Marge to open a small store specializing in adorable items. Since the family can't live off the store, Homer has no choice but to betray Mr. Burns and resume working at the plant, where Jay G has him throw out the remaining items from Mr, Burns' office and dismantle the trap door in his office as the last remnant of Mr. Burns' power. Jay G says Homer has proven himself and plies him with an unending supply of delicious cobblers (including pineapple). Remorseful, Homer goes to Springfield Cemetery to vomit in an open grave and finds Mr. Burns commiserating at his family mausoleum. Homer vows never to return to the plant and help Mr. Burns get back at Jay G. The following night, Homer and Mr. Burns are plotting their scheme when they discover that Bart has been spying on them. Since Homer never told Marge what he has been up to, Homer gets the idea to let Bart help them get their revenge, and Bart gets Milhouse to use his \\"white nerd\\" knowledge of rap history to research Jay G's background and find a way to ruin his reputation. As Milhouse presents his findings, Bart recognizes the candle salesman he met earlier, and Milhouse tells him that he is Jay's former writer, Jazzy James, who fell into obscurity after a falling-out. The group visits Jazzy, who explains that he wrote all the material for Jay G's first album, but couldn't make any money off it due to being forced to sign over all the rights. Jazzy is hired by the group to write a revenge rap directed at Jay G. Homer visits Marge's store again and finds that she has become unhinged from running the store. Homer and Bart learn that she has been affected by the \\"curse of the adorable little store\\", as stores like Marge's exist since rich people want a place for their friends to hang out after spin class. Meanwhile, during a break from recording sessions for the revenge rap, Mr. Burns and the group meet Jay G's ex-wife Praline (Taraji P. Henson) who beats Homer savagely with a catering tray but also helps them by bringing in Common, RZA, and Snoop Dogg to form a group called Hate Squad, featuring the Rhyme Crime All-Stars. At the night of the concert that's due to debut the revenge rap, however, Jay G appears to announce to Mr. Burns that he has bought the master recording of the revenge rap to dispose of it, and Jazzy James and the other rappers turn on Mr. Burns by selling out to Jay G. While Jazzy James claims that Jay G is too good to be beaten, Praline states that she doesn't recall hating Jay G while Common states that the acts of betrayal is part of the Road of Life. Homer returns to Marge's store to confess his actions to her. Marge easily forgives him, citing his big heart for staying loyal to Mr. Burns. As Mr. Burns comes up with a new revenge scheme, Marge sells her store off as she could no longer afford it. Mr. Burns enacts his plan by breaking into Jay G's mansion and capturing Goosius. Jay G comes out to feed Goosius, only to discover that Goosius had seemingly been killed and cooked by Mr. Burns. As Jay G laments the loss of his mascot, it is revealed that Goosius is still alive, as Homer neglected to kill him and got a roast goose from the local gas station instead. Mr. Burns and Jay G give chase to Goosius, with Mr. Burns intending to kill him. They both end up hanging from a chandelier that is about to fall. With death seemingly imminent, Jay G reveals the real reason he betrayed Mr. Burns is because he was following the advice book, specifically the last page ‚Äî \\"You will never be truly ruthless until you destroy the one who made you.\\" As Mr. Burns was his inspiration, bankrupting him was the final rung. As the chandelier plummets, Mr. Burns and Jay G are saved by the timely intervention of Smithers, who has finally returned from his adventure in Canada, although the lake ice he was tasked to collect had by now reduced to slush. In the end, the family returns home to Springfield, and Mr. Burns, with his wealth and empire restored, attempts to incorporate a moment of musical appreciation into the daily shift at the power plant (although he starts to reconsider the first time he enacts it). Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, stating \\"[...] the episode's charms are better than modest. If, as Selman says, 'The Great Phatsby' sort of mushroomed in the process, it's understandable, as guest stars Kevin Michael Richardson (as Burns' nemesis Jay G) and Keegan-Michael Key (as former Jay G musical collaborator Jazzy James) do stellar work in sizable roles. Richardson has done multiple spots on the show in recent years and is such a versatile and comfortable presence on The Simpsons that he's become something of an unofficial regular. And nobody has to sell Key at this point, as his ability to inhabit comic characters in short order is ideal for his role as the former rapper turned high-end candle salesman here. And with a brief but juicy role for Empire's Taraji P. Henson (as Praline, Jay G's very Cookie-like ex-wife who joins Mr. Burns revenge plan in the second half), and amusing cameos from real life rap royalty RZA, Common, and Snoop Dogg, there's enough legitimate blackness to make the whole 'Simpsons do a rap episode' thing less cringe-inducing than perhaps the initial description made it sound. Plus, the episode looks great.\\" =Ratings= \\"The Great Phatsby\\" scored a 2.8 rating with an 8 share and was watched by 6.90 million people, making \\"The Simpsons\\" Fox's highest-rated show of the night.

The group has often been accused of pro-Dutch sympathies in the struggle for Indonesian independence from Dutch colonial rule. History Following the end of the Second World War in Asia in 1945, separate units of Pao An Tui were formed by groups of Chinese-Indonesians, whom many Indonesian revolutionaries accused of siding with the Dutch. Units were created in Medan, North Sumatra in 1946, then in Java in 1947. In order to address the disorder and violence against and by Chinese-Indonesians, the important community organization Chung Hua Tsung Hui hosted a conference in Batavia, capital of colonial Indonesia, from August 24 until August 26, 1947. The conference resulted, on August 29, in the official formation of Pao An Tui, headquartered in Batavia. The Central Committee consisted of Loa Sek Hie (Chairman), Oey Kim Sen (Deputy Chairman), Khouw Joe Tjan (Secretary) and Cong Fai-kim (Treasurer), and claimed jurisdiction over all Pao An Tui units. The force claimed neutrality during the revolution, receiving support for its establishment from both Sutan Sjahrir, first Prime Minister of revolutionary Indonesia, and arms from the pro-Dutch Allied forces. Pao An Tui was disbanded in 1949 with the cessation of violence and the conclusion of the revolution in Indonesian Independence. Controversy and criticism The neutrality of Pao An Tui in the struggle for Indonesia's independence has been challenged on a number of occasions. The Indonesian revolutionary government, suspecting the force of pro-Dutch sympathies, refused to extend its formal recognition until 1948. A minority of left-wing Chinese-Indonesians at the time also strongly resisted the force due to its close ties to the right-wing Chinese-Indonesian colonial elite and the Kuomintang in China. In early 2016, a media furore was caused by the supposed unveiling of a monument to Pao An Tui at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah by the interior minister Tjahjo Kumolo. Rizieq Shihab, the Islamist leader of the Islamic Defenders Front, was one of the fiercest critics of the Indonesian government's apparent support for Pao An Tui. In fact, the monument in question was dedicated to an earlier Chinese militia, formed in the aftermath of the Chinese Massacre of 1740 in Batavia, that fought with the Javanese against the Dutch East India Company. Various conspiracy theories continue to be associated with the putative spectre of the Pao An Tui. For instance, in an opinion piece of May 2017, the writer and political commentator Batara Hutagalung accuses descendants of the Pao An Tui of conspiring with the Dutch government, supporters of Indonesian federalism and the defunct Indonesian Communist Party of destabilizing Indonesia by attempting to establish control over its resources, consumer market, as well as its geo-political and geo-strategic position as a form of 'historic revenge'.

The vessel's manufacturer, Bollinger Shipyards, of Lockport, Louisiana, delivered the ship to the Coast Guard on December 13, 2016, for her acceptance trials, and then John McCormick was commissioned on April 12, 2017 in Ketchikan, Alaska. Mission The Sentinel-class cutters are lightly armed patrol vessels with a crew of approximately two dozen sailors, capable of traveling almost 3,000 nautical miles, on five day missions. The cutter is a multi-mission vessel intended to perform law enforcement, search and rescue, fisheries and environmental protection, and homeland security tasks. Houma Today quoted Ben Bordelon, Bollinger's CEO, that John McCormick will \\"\\"assist in defending our nation's interests in the Alaskan maritime region.\\"\\" Operational history The John F. Middleton rescued the crew of the stranded fishing vessel Reluctant on September 23, 2020. On March 12, 2017, John McCormick stopped in Astoria, Oregon, on its way to its commissioning in Ketchikan. The Coast Guard invited Astoria residents to tour the vessel. The Daily Astorian reported that the Coast Guard was considering stationing two Sentinel-class cutters in either Astoria or Newport, Oregon. The vessel arrived in Ketchikan, Alaska on March 17, 2017. The Ketchikan fireboat, and smaller coast guard vessels, escorted her to her moorings. She was commissioned on April 12, 2017. Five other Sentinel-class cutters will be based in Alaska, including the USCGC Bailey T. Barco in Ketchikan. Charles Michel, the Coast Guard's Vice Commandant, attended the vessel's commissioning ceremony on April 12, 2017. He published an op-ed in the Juneau Empire celebrating the improvements the cutter offered over earlier models. He explained how important the cutter, the five sister ships that will join her patrolling Alaska's water, will be for the Alaskan economy. On September 23, 2020, the John F. McCormick proceeded to Hoonah, Alaska, on a rescue mission. Her crew rescued the crew of a fishing vessel that was stranded on rocks there, and were able to tow the vessel back to port. Namesake In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the United States Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all 58 cutters in the Sentinel class should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism. In 2014 the Coast Guard announced that John F. McCormick, a Coast Guard seaman who earned a Gold Lifesaving Medal for saving the life of fellow Coast Guard sailor, Richard O. Bracken, off Clatsop Spit, near the treacherous Columbia River bar, would be the namesake of the 21st cutter.  Accolades  On Jan 11th, 2018, the Douglas Munro Chapter of the Surface Navy Association awarded the crew of the Coast Guard Cutter John McCormick with the 2017 Hopley Yeaton Cutter Excellence Award (small cutter) in conjunction with the 2018 Surface Navy Association National Symposium in Washington, D.C. The John McCormick was awarded top honors over more than 150 cutters in the ‚ÄúSmall Cutter (175‚Ä≤ or less)‚Äù category. To merit this award, the cutter distinguished itself from other units through exceptional performance in categories including, but not limited to: 1\\\\. Operations and mission accomplishment 2\\\\. Cutter training and readiness 3\\\\. Engineering 4\\\\. Impact to the Fleet and examples of accomplishments for this cutter 5\\\\. Commitment to crew and families As the first Fast Response Cutter (FRC) assigned to Coast Guard District 17, cutter John McCormick was recognized for setting high standards in crew readiness and training. This training ensured John McCormick‚Äôs safe and timely transit of more than 6,000 nautical miles from Key West, Florida, to its homeport in Ketchikan, Alaska, and the crew‚Äôs rapid response to engineering and damage control casualties along the way. The John McCormick was also recognized for being an immediate asset to D17 where the crew conducted 77 fisheries boardings, saving or assisting 10 lives and more than $1 million in property and developed close bonds with the community. ‚ÄúIt is truly an honor for the crew of the John McCormick to be recognized for this prestigious award, especially considering the accomplishments over this calendar year, which included transiting to Ketchikan from Key West, getting commissioned in April, and serving the great state of Alaska ever since,‚Äù said Lt. Mike Moyseowicz, commanding officer of the cutter John McCormick. ‚ÄúMore than anything, this award is about the crew, all of whom sacrificed so many nights away from home in service to their country, and none of this would have been possible without their exceptional professionalism, teamwork, and dedication to serving others.‚Äù The Cutter John McCormick is a 154-foot Fast Response Cutter homeported in Ketchikan, Alaska.

Washington lived from the age of nine to sixteen, the pair were likely acquainted from an early age.Harlan, Louis R., Editor. The Booker T. Washington Papers, Volume 1: The Autobiographical Writings. Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1972.  Education  Smith grew up in a rural area without a lot of opportunity for education, especially for an African American woman. However, she was able to pursue advanced studies through hard work and determination. As a young woman, Fannie Smith attended the day program at a local school in Malden, with around eighty or ninety fellow pupils. Her intellect and determination attracted the attention of her teacher at the time, Booker T. Washington. Washington, only two years Fannie‚Äôs senior, paid special attention to those students he considered to have promise, and often prepared them to enter and attend the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia. Known colloquially as \\"Booker Washington‚Äôs boys\\", Fannie was the only woman in the group at the time. Soon after gaining admission to the Hampton Institute, Fannie Smith fell behind in payments, and temporarily left Hampton in 1878. For the next two years, Fannie taught at a school near Malden in order to save money for her own education. In addition to a daily three-mile walk to and from the school, Smith was also acting as a primary caregiver for her mother. In January 1880, she sent her final payment of $48 to J.F.B. Marshall. At that point, she was earning $32.50 a month through her teacher‚Äôs salary, but most of it was being used to meet household expenses. She was placed on the roll of honor, as a student \\"who, leaving the school in debt to it, have paid their debts in full from their earnings as teachers or otherwise\\". Smith returned to the Hampton Institute, graduating in June 1882.  Marriage and work at Tuskegee Institute  After Fannie‚Äôs graduation from the Hampton Institute in 1882, she and Booker T. Washington were married in Rice‚Äôs Zion Baptist Church in the Tinkersville section of Malden on August 2 of that year. She was twenty-four years old. Fannie‚Äôs mother, Celia, was \\"unenthusiastic\\" about the marriage because of Booker T. Washington‚Äôs unimpressive financial situation and because the marriage would take her daughter so far from home. The new couple moved to Tuskegee, Alabama, where Washington had accepted the position of principal of a new school for African American children the year before. Smith,Jessie Carney, Editor. Notable Black American Women, Book II. New York: Gale Research, Inc., 1996. The Washingtons rented a large home, and soon invited four other faculty members of the Tuskegee Institute to board with them. Fannie assumed the responsibility of institute housekeeper. She also immediately joined the faculty of the fledgling Tuskegee Institute, and is credited for broadening the curriculum for female students and developing the school‚Äôs home economics program. Her husband described their symbiotic working relationship and Fannie‚Äôs dedication to the school‚Äôs early stages, stating: \\"From the first she most earnestly devoted her thought and time to the work of the school, and was completely one with me in every interest and ambition.\\" Fannie Washington gave birth to the couple‚Äôs only child, Portia Marshall Washington, in 1883.American National Biography Online: http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00737.html; Harlan, Louis R., Editor. The Booker T. Washington Papers, Volume 1: The Autobiographical Writings. Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1972.  Death  On May 4, 1884, Fannie Smith Washington died suddenly of unknown causes. An account of her death, published in the Alumni Journal at Hampton, contained the following: > Her death is indeed a serious bereavement to Mr. Washington, whose > acquaintance and regard for the deceased had begun in their childhood. Their > happy union had done much to lighten the arduous duties developing upon him > in the management of his school. To his friends he had several times > expressed the great comfort his family life was to him. Fanny Smith Washington is buried in the Tuskegee University Campus Cemetery in Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. Although her name is interchangeably spelled \\"Fannie\\" and \\"Fanny\\", the seemingly less common spelling of \\"Fanny\\" is engraved on her tombstone.

Bry has served as President Pro Tem of the City Council since 2017. She is a Democrat, although city offices are officially nonpartisan. Bry is running for mayor of San Diego in the 2020 election. In announcing her campaign, Bry touted her background in high tech and support for science, technology, and arts. Life and career Prior to running for elected office for the first time in 2016, Barbara started her professional career working at Connect and then becoming an entrepreneur and serving on the initial management team of companies like ProFlowers.com. In 1998, Barbara founded Athena San Diego, an organization for women in the tech and life sciences community. In 2008, Barbara founded Run Women Run, an organization that recruits and trains pro- choice women to seek elected and appointed office. Barbara is married to entrepreneur Neil Senturia. San Diego City Council The 2016 San Diego City Council election for District 1 featured an open seat since incumbent Sherri Lightner was ineligible to run due to term limits. Bry, a Democrat, was expected to run against Republican Ray Ellis and Democrat Joe LaCava to replace Lightner. However, LaCava announced that he had decided not to run in January 2016. In March 2016, Bruce Lightner, husband to the incumbent Sherri Lightner, and Kyle Heiskala, a policy advisor on Sherri Lightner's City Council staff, pulled papers to run for the District 1 seat. Since no candidate received a majority of the votes in the June primary, Bry and Ellis were slated to advance to the November runoff election. However, on August 12, 2016 Ellis announced that he would be withdrawing from the election. Despite effectively conceding the race, Ellis's name still appeared on November ballot. Bry was then elected to the City Council in November. Bry has served as Council President Pro Tem since December 2017. She has taken action on several issues including short term vacation rentals, dockless vehicles, community choice energy, and establishing the Workplace Equity Initiative. She has also been supportive of an ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù economy, urging hiring decisions to be about what a person can do, not ‚Äúwho they know or when and where they went to school.‚Äù In 2020, as part of her campaign for Mayor of San Diego, Barbara Bry sent a mass email to donors with the inflammatory subject line, \\"They're coming for our homes!\\" This message, intended to criticize the YIMBY (Yes in My Backyard) movement as a threat to the rights of homeowners, and the city's neighborhood character.

He was voted the winner of the show's 33rd season, Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X in 2016. He returned for the show's 40th season Survivor: Winners at War, where he finished in 12th place. Early life Klein grew up in Burlingame, California, along with his parents Alan and Susie and his brother Evan. He graduated from The Nueva School in 2005 and Burlingame High School in 2009. At Burlingame, Klein was a three-year student body president and valedictorian, and he chaired his school's Relay for Life committee. After graduating high school, Klein attended Stanford University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations, with a minor in Spanish. While in college, he worked as an RA, an admissions associate, and a tour guide. Klein is Jewish.http://twitter.com/adamscottklein/status/812885525333831680 Survivor In 2014, Klein and his mother applied to be on the American reality competition show Survivor. They had hoped to go on the show together during the series' 29th season, Survivor: San Juan del Sur, a Blood vs Water edition of the show where pairs of loved ones participate in the game. But shortly thereafter, she was diagnosed with cancer, which ended her dream of going on Survivor with her son. Adam was given a standing invitation to join a future season solo.Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X reunion show, CBS, December 14, 2016 =Millennials vs. Gen X= While his mother was sick with cancer, Klein accepted his invitation for Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X, the show's 33rd season. As part of the original Vanua tribe, composed entirely of millennials, the 25-year-old survived the first four eliminations to make the Tribal Split on day 13, which distributed the remaining castaways across three new tribes. On day 9, he had discovered a hidden immunity idol at the Millennials camp. He was moved to Takali, formerly the tribe consisting entirely of Generation X members. There, he provided the swing vote on Night 18 that broke up the alliance/romance of Taylor Stocker and Jessica \\"Figgy\\" Figueroa, by sending Figueroa out of the game. Klein made it to the merge on day 21 and became part of the new Vinaka tribe. That same day, he found an advantage in the game which gave him the ability to steal another player's reward. He confided information about this advantage to Stocker, in an effort to win the latter's trust. In return, Stocker admitted that he had been secretly stashing food in a container underneath the sand. Klein and Stocker agreed to keep each other's secrets, while Klein urged Stocker to vote out Will Wahl at the next Tribal Council. But Stocker, still upset over the blindside of Figueroa, told Justin \\"Jay\\" Starrett, Klein's main rival, about the plan to target Wahl. Starrett then told Wahl, and the two of them, along with Stocker and Michelle Schubert, plotted to vote out Klein at the next Tribal. After Wahl won immunity on day 23, Klein and his allies, Hannah Shapiro and Zeke Smith decided to join the Gen X faction in voting out Schubert. That night, Klein received four votes, but the other nine went against Schubert. At the next Tribal Council on Night 25, Stocker revealed both his and Klein's secrets and insinuated that Klein had also eaten some of the stashed food. Klein refuted that claim while admitting to having a game advantage. Stocker, on the other hand, was eliminated on a 7‚Äì4‚Äì1 vote. On day 31, the surviving castaways were paid a visit by their loved ones. Klein's brother Evan was one of them. Before the challenge, Klein told everyone the details of his advantage but promised not to use it to take another player away from a loved one. The challenge would be won by Starrett, who allowed Klein and his brother to join on the reward, despite the fact that Starrett was Klein's main rival in the game. During the reward, a BBQ lunch, Klein was informed by his brother of their mother's condition and learned that doctors had stopped all treatment after her body failed to respond positively to it. Later on, Klein spoke about his mother's condition to Starrett, then thanked Starrett for the lunch by giving him the reward advantage. In return, when Starrett finally used the advantage to steal a reward from David Wright on day 36, Starrett invited Klein and Wright to join in on that reward. By day 38, with only four players remaining, Klein had once again become a target. But he teamed up with Shapiro in a plan to target Wright. In the process, Klein managed to convince Wright's ally Ken McNickle to vote against Wright, who was seen as a big threat to win the game. By the end of the night, Klein had survived to become one of the three finalists alongside Shapiro and McNickle. At the Final Tribal Council, when the jury grilled the finalists as to why they deserved to win, former Gen X tribe member Chris Hammons praised Klein for doing whatever it took to eliminate Wright at the Final Four when the others had failed‚Äîalthough McNickle would claim that it was his decision alone to vote out Wright. For the final question of the night, Wright asked all three finalists about growth and transformation in the game of Survivor. Klein, in his response, finally revealed to the entire jury his mother's condition, and how she had motivated him to win. After Survivor wrapped production for the season, Klein immediately rushed home to be with his mother. He made it home just in time to see her before she died an hour after his arrival. On December 14, 2016, it was announced, at the live Survivor finale, that he had received all ten jury votes to win the $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor, making him only the fifth unanimous winner in Survivor history, joining Earl Cole, J. T. Thomas, John Cochran, and Jeremy Collins. After talking about his mother's death on the live reunion show, he pledged to donate $100,000 of his winnings to Stand Up to Cancer, a charitable program that aims to raise significant funds for translational cancer research through online and televised efforts. =Winners at War= Klein competed again on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War.Meet the cast of Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved April 3, 2020Jeff Probst shares intel on Survivor: Winners at War Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved April 3, 2020 He immediately bonded with Denise Stapley when the two went off to find the well. While this made them potential targets going into the season's first Tribal Council, he escaped elimination and helped organize Natalie Anderson's elimination. On day 9, he became a target after leaking to Rob Mariano a plan to vote out Parvati Shallow. That night he received three votes from Mariano, Shallow and Ethan Zohn, but narrowly escaped elimination when Michele Fitzgerald, Ben Driebergen, Jeremy Collins, and Stapley voted out Zohn. When the Tribe Switch occurred, Klein was moved to the Yara tribe along with Driebergen and Mariano. While Adam had the numerical advantage, both he and Driebergen flipped on Mariano and blindsided him at Tribal Council on night 14. Klein reached the merge. At the merged Tribal Council, Klein received three votes from Fitzgerald, Wendell Holland and Nick Wilson, but was spared when the rest sided with him and blindsided Holland. Despite surviving, he was still a big target. On night 23, he attempted to make a last-ditch effort to save himself by attempting to play the voting podium symbol, believing it to be an idol, but he was wrong and subsequently voted out. He failed to win the second re-entry challenge and finished in 12th place. At the final tribal council, Klein along with eleven other jury members voted for Tony Vlachos to win. Career At the time of his Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X filming, Klein was living in San Francisco and was the manager of LifeMoves, a homeless shelter in the Bay Area. In 2017, he debuted as the host of the travel show Taiwan: Off the Grid on KPIX-TV in San Francisco. At the time of his Survivor: Winners At War filming, Klein was living in Los Angeles.

Many far-left groups derive from his ideas. Far-left politics in the United Kingdom have existed since at least the late 19th century, with the formation of various organisations following ideologies such as Marxism, revolutionary socialism, communism, anarchism and syndicalism. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution and developments in international Marxism, new organisations advocated ideologies such as Marxist‚ÄìLeninism, Left Communism and Trotskyism. Following the 1949 Chinese Revolution, further international developments from the 1960s led to the emergence of Maoist and later Hoxhaist groups. Political schisms within these tendencies created a large number of new political organisations, particularly from the 1960s to the 1990s. Definition Ian Adams, in his Ideology and Politics in Britain Today, defines the British far-left as primarily those political organisations which are \\"committed to revolutionary Marxism.\\". He names specifically \\"orthodox communists, those influenced by the New Left Marxism of the 1960s, followers of Trotsky, of Mao Tse-tung, of Fidel Castro, and even Enver Hoxha.\\". He states that although the British far-left is \\"highly complex\\", the main division is between the orthodox communists (i.e. - Marxist-Leninists, sometimes called \\"Stalinists\\") and Trotskyists. John Callaghan likewise focuses his The Far Left in British Politics on the five largest Marxist organisations, namely the 'official' Communist Party and the four most influential Trotskyist groups. However, Evan Smith in Against the Grain: The British Far Left from 1956, uses the term 'far left' \\"to encompass all of the political currents to the left of the Labour Party,\\" including \\"anarchist groups\\". History =Background and early groups, 1881‚Äì1920= Eleanor Marx was a member of Britain's earliest Marxist parties. Marxist political groups have been active in Britain since the mid 19th century, beginning with the Communist League. The earliest avowedly-Marxist national political party in Britain was however the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), founded by Henry Hyndman in 1881, initially as the Democratic Federation, and renamed following the affiliation of the Labour Emancipation League (LEL) in 1884. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels did not participate in the new \\"Marxist\\" organisation but the SDF counted among its members Marx's daughter Eleanor for a time, before she, her husband Edward Aveling, William Morris and the LEL broke away to found the libertarian Socialist League. Both parties were notable for not being willing to collaborate with \\"bourgeois\\" parties such as the Liberals on issues of reform, but differed on the question of participation in elections, which a majority of the Socialist League opposed. The SDF stood in elections from 1885 but with little success. Around the same time, less radical, reformist and ethical socialist groups emerged, such as the Fabian Society (1884) and Independent Labour Party (1893); the latter did not adhere strictly to the SDF's Marxist- derived scientific socialism and included a significant number of Christian socialists. An alliance between the three organisations did occur with the Labour Representation Committee in 1900, but this was not without tensions and led to fractures within the SDF. The Social Democratic Federation began to fracture over the issue of creeping reformism and also the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902, with Hyndman himself eventually being less than enthusiastic about opposing it. The immediate issue which caused a significant portion of the hard left to split was the debate at the 5th Congress of the Second International in Paris, over the entry of Marxist Alexandre Millerand into the \\"bourgeois\\" French government of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau. Those who opposed it, known as \\"Impossibilists\\", referred to supporters as \\"Opportunists\\" who were betraying revolutionary aims through class collaboration. Two significant groups broke with the SDF over this; the De Leonist-orientated Socialist Labour Party (SLP, formed 1903) of Neil Maclean (which also included James Connolly, later of Irish republican fame and was most prominent in Scotland) and the Socialist Party of Great Britain (formed 1904). The period leading up to the First World War saw a renewal of industrial militancy outside of the mainstream Labour Movement's traditional commitment to parliamentary politics. The Industrialist League and Industrial Workers of Great Britain emerged in 1908-9 from the British Advocates of Industrial Unionism initially founded by the SLP. The Industrial Syndicalist Education League was formed the following year by dissident members of the SDF. The SDF eventually morphed into a new Marxist party, the British Socialist Party, along with some members on the left of the ILP, with Hyndman leading. With the advent of the First World War conflict arose between \\"internationalist\\" and \\"national defence\\" factions, with Hyndman taking a nationalist stance. Vladimir Lenin, who had visited London six times from 1902 to 1911, was critical of this and supported the internationalists. Matters came to a head in 1916, when the defeated Hyndman left to found the National Socialist Party, while his internationalist opponents Alf watts, Zelda Kahan and Theodore Rothstein supported the Zimmerwald Conference. In Scotland, the BSP's John Maclean was involved in the Red Clydeside movement. From 1916 to 1920, the British Socialist Party would be the largest proto-communist party in Britain and, although affiliated to the Labour Party for the 1918 general election, was shortly afterwards the largest founding group of the Communist Party of Great Britain. = Marxist‚ÄìLeninism in Britain, 1920‚Äì1947 = Arthur MacManus was the chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain, until his 1927 death. The Communist Party of Great Britain was officially established in 1920 as the British Section of the Communist International (also known as the Third International) and adopted the theories of Leninism. The largest chunk of its members came from the British Socialist Party; the internationalist faction which had ousted Hyndman in 1916. Other groups involved were the Communist Unity Group (primarily from Glasgow), which had split from the De Leonist Socialist Labour Party, represented by the likes of Arthur MacManus, Tom Bell and William Paul and also the South Wales Socialist Society, which mainly consisted of Welsh coal-miners. Unity was not unanimous however, as some other groups were founded outside of CPGB control; the Communist Party of South Wales and the West of England, the Communist Labour Party (based in Scotland, featuring John Maclean) and the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) (associated with suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst). There was also the Communist League of Guy Aldred, which included not only Marxists, but also anarcho- communists. By January 1921, most of the aforementioned groups had joined the CPGB, with the exception of the Communist League, which became the Anti- Parliamentary Communist Federation (which came to oppose Leninism). Studies of the period have revealed that in terms of participation, the Celtic fringe were over-represented, while the English were under-represented in the early days of British communism.. In particular, the communists gained working-class support among the Welsh in the Rhondda Valley and the Scots in West Fife (both being major mining areas at the time). Some of the Irish Catholic diaspora, especially in the big industrial cities of Britain, also played a role. As well as this \\"Celtic\\" tinge, prominent in the East End of London (Hackney, Whitechapel and Bethnal Green). were Jewish diaspora who had recently fled pogroms in the Russian Empire. John Maclean; the revolutionary best regarded by Lenin and the Russian Bolsheviks; played no role in the CPGB. He had claimed that the party's first MP, Cecil L'Estrange Malone and leading figure, Theodore Rothstein (who also wrote for the Manchester Guardian), were \\"police spies\\"; they in turn claimed that he was insane after his time of mistreatment in prison. By 1923, Maclean had died so the issue was at an end. The far-left were thrust into the spotlight in the lead up to the 1924 general election, with the appearance of the \\"Zinoviev letter\\" in the Daily Mail. The sitting Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald had earlier in the year recognised the Soviet government as legitimate and in the letter, supposedly written by Grigory Zinoviev (head of the Comintern) to Arthur MacManus, it stated improving British-Soviet relations would have the effect of \\"revolutionising of the international and British proletariat not less than a successful rising in any of the working districts of England.\\" The implication from the conservative press was that MacDonald and Labour were a Trojan horse for Bolshevism. For his part Zinoviev denied authorship, but it was widely believed in Britain at the time. It would not be until the late 1960s that researchers challenged its authenticity more fully and it is today regarded as a forgery. A number of activists, including Albert Inkpin spent time in prison under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 in the mid-1920s. In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin was in the ascent and developed a policy of what is known as Stalinism; which the CPGB leadership upheld. Subsequently, internal divisions emerged, as the first official (endorsed by Leon Trotsky's International Left Opposition) British Trotskyist group, the Communist League, was founded in 1932. Some communists took part in the League against Imperialism, which primarily attacked the Franco-British empires. In the 30s, Communists and Trotskyists also worked within the Revolutionary Policy Committee and Guild of Youth inside the Independent Labour Party (ILP), in the Labour League of Youth, and within the Labour-affiliated Socialist League and Scottish Socialist Party. In Europe, communist alternatives to liberalism were rivaled by ultra-nationalism; this included local variants such as the British Union of Fascists, whom the CPGB exchanged violence with (most famously at the Battle of Cable Street in 1936). The CPGB organised the British Battalion of the International Brigades, which took part in the Spanish Civil War. From 1939 to 1941, the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was in place; in response to CPGB General Secretary Harry Pollitt supporting the British declaration of war on Germany, he was replaced by Rajani Palme Dutt. With the launching of Operation Barbarossa, the position of the CPGB changed course swiftly; the Marxist- Leninists now backed the Allied cause in the Second World War against the Axis powers. As part of this Pollitt returned to the leadership. The situation within British Trotskyism was more complex. There were two competing groups; the Revolutionary Socialist League (official representatives of the Fourth International, formed from a merger of various groups derived from the Communist League) and the Workers' International League. Trotskyists debated about whether the Soviet Union, despite Stalin, was worth defending. The WIL was pro-war, while the RSL was more fractured; the leadership adopted Trotsky's Proletarian Military Policy, while the Left Fraction and the Center supported \\"revolutionary defeatism.\\". Polemics were exchanged and the CPGB attacked Trotskyists with the pamphlet \\"Clear Out Hitler's Agents\\".. The Trotskyists unified as the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1944. The Allied victory in the war left the CPGB in its strongest position, with two MPs elected in 1945. =Dawning of the Cold War, 1947‚Äì1968= Following the defeat of the Axis powers and the brief period of public prominence for the CPGB, the international political system realigned into the start of the Cold War, which pitted the Western Allies (including Britain), against the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. There was an ideological component to this struggle, as a competition between the ideas of Marxist-Leninism and capitalism. As a consequent, in Britain anti-communist polemics became prominent in the 1950s. This did not just include the Tory right, but prominent elements of the mainstream Labour Party, such as Ernest Bevin, who viewed the United States instead as an ally. Partly in response to the anti-communist hysteria of the times, the CPGB created Britain's Road to Socialism in 1951 (replacing the earlier program For Soviet Britain), which stated that the party supported a democratic road to socialism, with working-class leadership through the trade union movement. Espionage and counter-espionage took place between the Cold War powers during the period. Some of the most famous Soviet agents, working for the NKVD and KGB in Britain during the time were the Cambridge Five (most famously Kim Philby) and the Portland Spy Ring. The New Reasoner was founded by ex-CPGB members in 1957 who created the New Left. While Trotskyist groups had existed prior to the 1950s, it was during this time that the key figures who would go on to define British Trotskyism for decades and lead it to becoming the most prominent far-left tendency with the decline of Marxist- Leninism, namely Gerry Healy, Ted Grant and Tony Cliff, founded their own organisations. The Revolutionary Communist Party fractured over the topic of entryism into the Labour Party and on how to approach the Cold War and eventually coalesced around the entryist group The Club, in 1950. Cliff and Grant split the same year, forming the Socialist Review Group, and the International Socialist Group (later merged into the Revolutionary Socialist League), respectively.Callaghan, John (1984). British Trotskyism: Theory and Practice. Basil Blackwell. Crick, Michael (2016). Militant. Biteback. The Labour Party banned The Club's journal Socialist Outlook in 1954 and under Healy's leadership The Club would reemerge as an open political party, the Socialist Labour League in 1959, who were associated with the Healy-led International Committee of the Fourth International. They were able to poach members of the CPGB after the tendency became fractured and demoralised by Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 speech On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences. According to George Matthews, Khrushchev made a deal with the CPGB to provide a secret annual donation of more than ¬£100,000 in used notes. The year 1956 would be definitive in the history of the CPGB, however. Not only did they have to deal with the fallout of Khrushchev's aforementioned \\"secret speech\\", which attacked the legacy of Joseph Stalin, alienating those within the party who regarded Stalin as a great socialist, but also the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 made some British communists uncomfortable, causing a membership drop. One of the most significant defections in the aftermath of this was the resignation of a number of Communist Party Historians Group intellectuals (with the exception of Eric Hobsbawm), who defined themselves as against \\"the tankies.\\" They went on to found the New Left current; E. P. Thompson and John Saville founded the New Reasoner, which eventually became the New Left Review. They became associated with the broad pacifist group the CND. The New Left was co-founded by Gramscian-inspired Stuart Hall who played a key role in the introduction of identity politics currents such as cultural studies and is called the \\"godfather of multiculturalism.\\" For the more ardent Marxist-Leninists who lamented what they regarded as the revisionist slander against Stalin, the Sino-Soviet split allowed them the opportunity to align with the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong as a suitable alternative to the Khrushchevite- Moscow line. In 1963, the Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity under Michael McCreery broke away from the CPGB to become the first British far-left grouping advocating Maoism.. Although they, like future Maoist groups would remain very small factions on the far-left and would later fracture themselves. In the coming decades, it would be the Trotskyists who would benefit most from the decline of the CPGB. =1968ers and ascent of Trotskyism, 1968‚Äì1991= Tariq Ali of the Trotskyist IMG was one of the most prominent British figures of the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign. A new generation of political activists emerged growing partly from the groundwork prepared by the earlier revisionism of the first New Left thinkers and were energised as part of a general opposition to the Vietnam War, with the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign being the most active (founded by what became the Trotskyist International Marxist Group). This was transformative for the British far- left. Anti-war activism also had the effect of radicalising student politics and leading to the re-politicisation of the National Union of Students; around the same time, the protests of 1968 were rocking the Western world. Tony Cliff's Trotskyist-orientated International Socialists (later known as the Socialist Workers Party) were able to recruit many students, while Healy's group opposed the protests and lost out. In Continental Europe during the early 1970s, there were instances of the new radicalism turning into Marxist- Leninist paramilitary campaigns (such as the Red Brigades in Italy and the Baader-Meinhof Group in Germany). With the exception of the anarcho-communist Angry Brigade, the far-left in Britain did not widely engage in such activities. However, there were some, mainly ideological, connections to early phases of The Troubles and civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. For instance C. Desmond Greaves' Connolly Association (part of the CPGB) had an ideological influence on the Marxist-Leninist turn of Sinn F√©in and the Irish Republican Army (which, following the split in the republican movement, became the Officials faction). Indeed, the perpetrator of the 1972 Aldershot bombing had spent time in the British Maoist CDRCU group. The non-communist Provisionals, who spearheaded the republican campaign, garnered \\"critical support\\" from some British Trotskyist groups, most prominently the IMG. early on, under the rationale of anti-imperialism and much later in the 1980s had the Trotskyist-orientated People's Democracy merge into PSF. . For the CPGB, the significance of 1968 was different; in some ways a re-run of 1956, as Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia under the Brezhnev Doctrine in opposition to the Prague Spring. This time, the more liberal-reformist internal opposition, now known as Eurocommunists, remained within the CPGB and by the mid-1970s had further changed the party into a direction favoured by the earlier New Left. . The Gramscian-Eurocommunists favoured the \\"cultural\\" politics of new social movements, such as feminism, . environmentalism, anti- racism campaigns, student politics and gay rights (from 1975, backing the NUS) over militant working-class politics. Prominent figures in the Eurocommunist- push were Dave Cook, Sue Slipman and those associated with Martin Jacques's Marxism Today (the monthly theoretical journal of CPGB). More anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninist groups broke away such as Reg Birch's Communist Party of Britain (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (initially pro-China Maoists, but later Hoxhaist after the Sino-Albanian split) in 1968 and Sid French's New Communist Party of Britain in 1977. The 1970s also heralded the growth of the British far-right in the form of the National Front and the more establishment-based Conservative Monday Club. Building on from their new base in student politics, Trotskyist groups attempted to disrupt far-right groups organising (sometimes physically), which they deemed to be \\"racist or fascist.\\" The IMG pioneered the No Platform policy,. while Cliff's SWP created groups such as the Anti- Nazi League in 1975 and the Rock Against Racism festival in 1976 (attracting popular groups such as The Clash). . Although SWP-controlled, these latter groups attracted a broader array of people to their protests against the far- right than just far-left activists. Indeed, involvement in race-related politics became more thematic during this period, including the campaign against apartheid in South Africa, supporting Black power movements, an Anti- Zionist approach to the Palestine-Israel conflict and further support for Irish republicanism. This led to some unorthodox alliances, such as David Yaffe's Trotskyist RCG supporting the Soviet Union's Comecon as a force of anti-imperialism (Frank Furedi's RCP; later creators of Living Marxism; split in 1978 over this). Peter Taaffe was the General Secretary of Militant. He had a significant influence over Liverpool City Council policies during the 1980s. The decline of the CPGB and internal divisions between Eurocommunists and traditionalists were exemplified in the party's publications, with the Eurocommunists exercising control over the party's monthly theoretical journal Marxism Today and the traditional Marxist-Leninists having editorial control over the CPGB's daily newspaper Morning Star. Such divisions made it difficult for the party to deal with the ascent of Margaret Thatcher and her economic policies of neoliberalism; privatizing major parts of the British industrial sector and moving towards a service economy. For instance, during the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì85, the divide between the Marxism Today (Euros) and Morning Star (trads) factions meant that no effective program at the national level could be developed to aid the National Union of Mineworkers. Although the Soviet Union did provide some assistance, NUM president Arthur Scargill tended to the Labour left, rather than the far-left. More successful for a time during the 1980s, were the gains of Trotskyist entrism from Ted Grant and Peter Taaffe's Militant tendency. . Working within the Labour Party, they were able to get Terry Fields, Dave Nellist and Pat Wall elected as MPs, as well as having major influence over Liverpool City Council, until Neil Kinnock moved to shut them down. =Since the Soviet dissolution, 1991‚Äìpresent= The dissolution of the Soviet Union; the world's first communist state; in 1991, following the Revolutions of 1989 and the policy of Perestroika under Mikhail Gorbachev, leading to the end of the Cold War, had a massive knock on effect on the world communist movement. In Britain, the faction within the CPGB who still adhered to Marxism-Leninism broke away earlier in 1988 to found the Communist Party of Britain under Mike Hicks. The Eurocommunist-leadership and rump under Nina Temple officially dissolved the CPGB in November 1991, . abandoning all pretense of adherence to Marxist-Leninist politics. The CPGB was replaced by the \\"post-communist\\" think-tank, the Democratic Left which espoused adherence to feminism, green politics and democratic socialism. The remaining Straight Left faction under Andrew Murray continued on as the Communist Liaison Group instead, until eventually merging with the Communist Party of Britain in the mid-1990s. As well as this, some of the Scottish CPGB members founded the Glasgow-based Communist Party of Scotland in 1991 . associated with Mick McGahey and Gordon McLennan, advocating Scottish independence from Britain.

Discovery  WWAV is an emerging virus; previously, it was widely distributed among woodrats (Neotoma spp.), its reservoir, in the American Southwest and was not known to infect humans. However, during June 1999-May 2000, three female patients, aged 14, 30, and 52, developed similar fatal illnesses. The illnesses were associated with nonspecific febrile symptoms including fever, headache, and myalgias and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two developed liver failure and hemorrhagic fever. All three patients died 1‚Äì8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Arenavirus-specific RNA was detected in each patient using RT-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the patients were essentially identical and was 87% similar to the WWA virus prototype strain (obtained from a white-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula) from New Mexico in the early 1990s). According to a family member, one patient had cleaned rodent droppings in her home during the two weeks before the onset of illness, while the other patients had no known contact with rodents. None of the patients traveled outside of California within four weeks of illness.  Epidemiology  Previous cases of infection were from California. However, the virus has been found in woodrats in New Mexico and, more recently, in Utah, Oklahoma, and Texas.  Clinical  WWAV infection is associated with hemorrhagic fever with liver failure. It is often associated with a mild febrile illness, with symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias.  Transmission and Prevention  Like other arenaviruses, WWAV appears to be transmitted through rodents. Therefore, direct contact with rodents, their feces, and their nesting materials should be avoided. Surfaces contaminated with rodent feces should be disinfected. In addition, control of rodents near homes can help prevent infection. Rodent carcasses and materials should be double-bagged before disposal. Although it is unclear if WWAV can be transmitted nosocomially, other arenaviruses have been transmitted through contact with an infected patient's blood, urine, or pharyngeal secretions.

Ranging from 10‚Äì12 members playing horns, guitars, violins, percussion, and accordion, their sound incorporates Ethiojazz, folk, and pop styles from the Horn of Africa infused with tinges of motifs from Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as punk, experimental, and psychedelic rock. Rolling Stone described Debo's sound as, \\"guitar solos, massed vocals, violin and brass [that] rush in like a Red Bulled marching band...Dance at your own risk.\\" History Saxophone player Danny Mekonnen and singer Bruck Tesfaye performing with Debo Band in 2014 Sudanese-born saxophone player Danny Mekonnen had grown up in Texas listening to his parents' home taped Ethiopian pop cassettes. In middle school he became obsessed with American jazz of the 1950s and 1960s, poring over records by John Coltrane and Miles Davis and went on to study and play jazz at the University of Texas. In the early 2000s he moved to Boston to attend Harvard University and being gigging in Boston's diverse music scene. In wanting to musically connect to his Ethiopian-American heritage, Mekonnen assembled a trio with vocalist Bruck Tesfaye to learn a few Ethioian pop songs. They sought to expand the group and recruited members of Boston's recently defunct Stick and Rag Village Orchestra, a group of self-taught musicians who'd played old-time circus tunes, as well as klezmer and Balkan brass standards as part of the burgeoning radical street band movement. They worked out several tunes from the canon of Ethio-pop and jazz heard on the √âthiopiques compact disc series and recruited local members of the Ethiopian community to sing. \\"These were amazing people who had completely internalized the rhythms and melodies that we were struggling to learn,\\" Mekonnen told The Boston Phoenix. \\"You couldn't say, 'Come in after four bars.' They didn't know what a bar was. It was an adventure for everyone.\\" After many performances for the Ethiopian community, Bruck Tesfaye stayed on as the band's permanent singer, and the group took on the name \\"Debo\\" meaning \\"communal labor.\\" For their first few years Debo Band remained in Boston's underground music scene, sharing bills with hip hop and experimental music acts in basements, small clubs, and at loft parties around the city. While Debo began as a primarily acoustic outfit‚Äîsaxophones, brass, violins, accordion, and *drums ‚Äîthey eventually added electric bass and guitar to create a fuller sound that brought them to play bigger venues. With the help of √âthiopiques curator Frances Falceto, the group traveled to Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zanzibar in 2009 and 2010 for performances at large world music festivals, often to crowds who had never before heard Ethiopian music. Debo Band performing with Fendika in 2010 In 2010 Debo self-released their first EP, a 4-song collaboration with the group Fendika from Addis Ababa with whom they toured the U.S. and Eastern Africa. The CD featured covers of well-known Ethiopian jazz and pop tunes by Walias Band, Mahmoud Ahmed, and others, half of which were recorded in Africa, the others in the United States. Following a pair of singles with B-sides remixed by DJ Kiddid, Debo Band's self-titled first full-length album was released by Sub Pop Records in 2012. Produced by Thomas Gobena of the group Gogol Bordello, the record draws heavily from Ethiopia in the early 1970s, with original songs, reworkings of Ethiopian folk melodies, covers of hits by Al√®may√®hu Esh√®t√©, Mahmoud Ahmed, Muluqen Mellesse, and Bezunesh Bekele, plus instrumentals by Getatchew Mekuria rearranged to have the sax man's scales played by a duet of violins. National Public Radio named the record one of their 50 Favorite Albums of 2012. For the band's tenth anniversary, Debo released their second album Ere Gobez on Chicago-area label FPE Records. Named for a fervent battle cry known as \\"the call of the lionhearted\\", 'the record offered a faster, harder-hitting sound than their first album, with many nods to various band members' backgrounds in ethnomusicology. One song, \\"Blue Awaze,\\" mashes up part of Duke Ellington's Far East Suite with the sound of Addis Ababa's legendary Police Orchestra. Another song, \\"Rafaad iyo Raaxo,\\" pats tribute to Somalia's Dur Dur Band of the 1980s. The track ‚ÄúHiyamikachi Bushi\\" bridges Ethiopian and Okinawan music as arranged by the band's accordionist Mari√´ Abe, and in 2016 Debo became the first non-Japanese group to enter the song in Okinawa's annual International Competition of Hiyami Kachi Bushi. Pitchfork called Ere Gobez, \\"a big, brave roar, song after song...a powerful, and, perhaps, inspirational record.\\" Related projects While in Ethiopia, Debo Band scored the 2009 film Lazare (\\"For Today\\"), sound engineered by Debo's bass guitarist, PJ Goodwin.. In 2018 Debo backed Ethiopian vocalist Ayal√©w M√®sfin for concerts in the U.S. Debo violinist Kaethe Hostetter lives in Addis Ababa where she runs the Ethiopian String Center and plays in the bands Qwanqwa and Zena Bel, the latter with members of Fendika.

The site is thought to belong to the megalithic prehistoric and protohistoric periods of Sri Lanka and is considered one of the several ancient burial sites that have been found in the country. The site is situated on the Kurunegala - Dambulla road approximately five kilometers southwest of Dambulla town. Currently, the tomb site has been designated an archaeological protected site in Sri Lanka. Discovery and excavation The prehistoric period of Sri Lanka ranges from 250,000 ‚Äì 1,000 BC. The transition period between the end of the prehistoric period and the commencement of the historic period is known as the protohistoric period. The Ibbankatuwa tomb site was first identified in 1970 by the Archaeological Department. Radiocarbon dating carried out on remains found at the site have revealed that these tombs date back to 700 ‚Äì 400 B.C. Subsequently, a number of archaeological excavations were carried out in 1983‚Äì1984 and again between 1988 and 1990. Ancient Settlement The ancient Ibbankatuwa settlement is located about southwest of the Dambulu Oya river and approximately east of the eastern edge of the cemetery. The site is approximately in size. The first excavation was done in 1988 and then in 1989, 1990 and 1991. Tombs The tomb complex covers an area of about with 42 clusters of tombs and each cluster contains about 10 tombs. Each tomb is enclosed with four stone slabs and covered by another slab on top. According to the way of interment two distinct burial customs, urn (bodies were placed in urns and interred) and cist (ashes of deceased were interred) have been identified. Cremated remains along with grave goods and tools used by deceased, have been found at the site in large terra-cotta urns and cists as well as in the area between the cists. The finds include variety of clay pots, iron, copper and gold artifacts, beads, necklaces, etc. The gemstones found in some necklaces are not naturally found in Sri Lanka which indicates that they may have been imported.

If 16 December falls on a weekend, the following Monday will be a holiday. Significance By the 1980s, democratization in the Soviet Union began to rise with the Jeltoqsan protests in 1986. Following a major unrest in Central and Eastern Europe that began in Poland which culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the spillover of these events led to the crisis within the individual republics. In an attempt to keep unity within the Soviet Union, the country held a referendum on 16 March 1991 and Kazakhstan voted 95% in favor of a new Union of Sovereign States. After the aborted coup d'√©tat in August, the Supreme Soviet (Kazakhstan) passed the Constitutional Independence Law of Republic of Kazakhstan on 16 December 1991. Despite the swift collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan was the last to declare its independence. The declaration was followed up by the Alma-Ata Protocol which would give birth to the Commonwealth of Independent States.http://www.kstu.kz/independence-day-of- the-republic-of- kazakhstan/?lang=enhttps://publicholidays.asia/kazakhstan/independence-day/ Independence ushered in the era of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, during which a new two house parliamentary system and a new capital was established. The Armed Forces of the Republic was also established to meet the needs of defence while the economic system was being radically transformed to meet international standards.

It tends to be commemorated indoors due to the coinciding winter season. The Astana Opera organizes concerts involving national orchestras that will perform traditional music. Many nationalist politicians and activists use the holiday as an occasion to accuse to the Russian government of attempted genocide of the ethnic population during periods such as the Kazakh famine of 1932‚Äì33 and the population transfer of Kazakhs in the Soviet Union. Independence Day is also used as a day of remembrance of the 1986 Jeltoqsan protests on Brezhnev Square (present-day Republic Square) against the government of Gennady Kolbin, which began on the same day as Independence Day. The first independence day military parade of Kazakhstan was held on Almaty's Republic Square in 1996 timed to the occasion of the 5th anniversary of independence.

The Chinipas arises deep in the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state of Chihuahua, and then flows through long rugged canyon systems into the state of Sinaloa until it finally joins the main trunk of the Fuerte River in the western foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The Fuerte River then flows westward over the western coastal plain of Sonora to the Pacific Ocean, emerging very near the port of Topolobampo. The Chinipas river is the northwest most of the six rivers that make the six distinct extensive canyons in the Sierra Madre Occidental that are collectively referred to as the Copper Canyon area. All six rivers flow into the Fuerte River. Each of the six large rivers that flow into the Fuerte River have deep rugged canyons, and these canyons have many ravines and tributaries. Topographically the Copper Canyon region is a very rugged and remote area with few towns and few roads. Going upstream from the Fuerte River on the Chinipas River, there is the town of Chinipas, Chihuahua and further upstream the town of Oteros, Chihuahua. The town of Uruachi, Chihuahua lies in a side canyon north of the Chinipas River. The mining town of Maguarichi, Chihuahua lies in another side canyon to the north of the Chinipas river. The Oteros River is a major tributary of the Chinipas, entering the Chinipas River near the town of Oteros. The Chinipas and the Oteros Rivers each lie in deep canyons with many side ravines. After the two rivers are joined they continue in the large Chinipas/Oteros canyon, also having many side ravines. The Canyon of the Chinipas/Otero is estimated to be 1600 meters or 5,250 feet deep. Over the last 20 to 30 years, this general area in the Sierra Madre Occidental, along with other areas in the neighboring Mexican states of Sonora, Sinaloa and Durango, have been used extensively for the cultivation of various illegal drugs, and the area is also a corridor in which illegal drugs are transhipped north to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican border. These activities have made this area increasingly dangerous for travel. The drainage basin area of the canyons of the Chinipas River and the Oteros River and their tributaries is incised into the high plateau of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The entire road system in the Sierra Madre Occidental is minimal and undeveloped, but the Chinipas/Oteros River system may be accessed by four access zones. The first is the region between Creel and Divisadero. The second is by the mining town of Maguarichi which is not on the Chinipas River, but which is close to it. The third is by reaching the city of Uruachi, which lies in a smaller side canyon north of the Chinipas/Oteros canyon. A fourth access is a road that goes directly to the town of Chinipas on the river and the Chinipas/Oteros canyon, but this road is known to be difficult for its bad conditions. Below the town of Chinipas, and only a short distance before the Chinipas flows into the Fuerte River is a tributary of the Chinipas River, which is the Septentrion River. The Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pac√≠fico (Chihuahua-Pacific Railway, also known as El Chepe from its reporting mark CHP) passes through this area. It crosses the Chinipas River near its unction with the Septentrion River, and then runs up the Septentrion canyon through the Sierra Madre Mountains.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History Beginning in the early 1860s, African Americans began migrating to Isabella, Mecosta, and Montcalm Counties in Michigan. These settlers, primarily from Ohio, but also from Ontario and other parts of Michigan, were drawn by the promise of inexpensive land in the Homestead Act of 1860. This cemetery was informally established in 1864, when Ann Marie (Calliman) Guy, who arrived in the area in 1861 with her husband James Guy, was buried here. Although there was no formal action to set aside the property as a cemetery, over 50 burials took place here in the 19th century. In 1867, Daniel and Mille Cummins Porter, who had arrived in Mecosta County in 1861, purchased a 120-acre farm which included the cemetery land. They eventually left the land to their foster son Aaron Morgan. In 1896, Aaron and Joanna Morgan bequeathed a half-acre parcel of land to the West Wheatland Union Cemetery Association. In 1954, Hubert J. and Bernadette Lehnert, then owners of the Morgan Farm, added another two acres. As of 2013, the entire cemetery housed about 400 burial sites, with about 225 in the old section. The cemetery is still in use. Description The Morgan West Wheatland Cemetery is a rectangular, 2-1/2 acre burial ground fronting on 55th Avenue. Graves are located in the rear of the property, while the front is open. A two-track lane leads to the rear portion of the cemetery. The cemetery contains over 380 marked graves and another 25 unmarked graves. The cemetery is maintained and neatly trimmed. Graves are laid out in a rectangular grid. Monuments include a range of styles seen in the Midwest, and are constructed from marble, sandstone, limestone, granite, fieldstone, and concrete. They include tablet headstones, pedestals with urn tops, slant-face markers, flat-top markers, and others. Government-issued monuments for veterans are also included. Four monuments or planters are built from fieldstone, and a number of concrete markers, some apparently homemade. A number of early markers display Christian symbolism, including a weeping willow, flowers and foliage, doves, and clasped hands.

She headed the science education research division of the National Science Foundation, was an advisor to several influential educational television shows, and served on numerous national standards and review committees. Rowe authored over 100 journal articles and several books.  Early life and education  Born and raised in New Jersey, Rowe attributed her interest and approach to science education to an early encounter with Albert Einstein. On her middle school's annual visit to Princeton, she encountered the physicist gesturing and moving his hands rapidly, looking at a fountain. He asked Rowe, then in seventh grade, if she could stop the water long enough to see the shapes of the droplets. He then showed her how to wave her fingers to create a strobe effect and examine the shapes the water made. Rowe and Einstein experimented together for a few minutes to achieve the best effect. As Rowe would tell the story, as he left her he said \\"Never forget that science is just that kind of exploring and fun.\\" \\"Nearly half a century later,\\" wrote Rowe in 1995, \\"I've spent an entire career trying to impart Einstein's words to adults and children all over the world: Science is exploring, and exploring is fun.\\" Rowe attended college in New Jersey, graduating with bachelor's degrees in biology and education in 1947. She earned a master's degree in zoology at the University of California, Berkeley in 1954. She earned a doctorate in science education from Stanford University in 1964.  Research  = Wait Time = In the early 1970s, Rowe published research newly describing a variable of teacher behavior, \\"wait time,\\" to measure the amount of time a teacher waits for a student to start answering a question and the amount of time a teacher waits once the student stops speaking before continuing the lesson or asking another question. Rowe found that a number of student outcomes improved when teachers waited longer for students to answer. Rowe collected hundreds of recordings of classroom talk, and fed the sound from the tapes into a mechanical plotter to allow her to measure the lengths of pauses in conversation. This work found that teachers were waiting an average of less than a second for the student to answer, or for the student to continue his or her answer after pausing. When teachers were coached to wait longer, students use of language and logic improved, as did student and teacher attitudes and expectations. Students' answers increased in length by 300 to 700 percent, contained more inferences and speculative teaching, and shifted the classroom experience to more teacher and student exchanges ‚Äî relying less on teacher show-and-tell. Moreover, the number of \\"I don't know\\" and non-responses decreased. Additional studies found consistent results in a variety of educational settings, from elementary to college-age students, and from special educational to gifted and talented classes. Rowe and others' work also found that there was a significant threshold effect: when wait time increased to 2.7 seconds or longer, performance improved, smaller increases yielded significantly smaller benefits. = Praise and \\"fate control\\" = Rowe's classroom conversation studies also examined how teachers responded to student answers. Rose found that \\"sanctioning behavior\\"‚Äîeither positive praise or negative feedback‚Äîdiscouraged the quality of student responses. Even when positive praise was consistently offered, student response became questioning (\\"the answer is five?\\"); in essence, Rowe found, praise led students to be more focused on discovering whether the teacher would approve than on discovering how the scientific phenomenon worked. Rowe proposed that understanding science confers a sense of \\"fate control,\\" giving the student confidence that they can control outcomes in the world, and that reliance on teacher praise eroded this sense of controlling one's own fate.  Advocacy and education  As leader of the science education research division of the National Science Foundation from 1976 to 1980, and later in her career, Rowe advocated improved science education techniques across the United States and internationally. She served on several high-profile commissions, including the National Research Council Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. In 1993-94, Rowe co- chaired the blue ribbon Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology, which produced one of the most comprehensive federal reviews of science education programs. The panel recommended overhauling the approach to funding these programs, with far greater emphasis on assessing which programs were effective and coordinating across agencies. After the release of the report, Rowe said \\"We're in a competitive, almost life-death kind of struggle with other countries. And I don't think we can afford to invest big amounts in programs that don't work.\\" Rowe also brought her expertise in science education to a number of broader forums. She served as a science advisor to educational television shows, 3-2-1 Contact, Voyage of the Mimi, and Reading Rainbow.  Impact  Rowe's research on wait time has had an lasting impact, influencing how science educators are trained for decades after first publication. Upon Rowe's death in 1996, Richard Shavelson, dean of the Stanford School of Education, lauded Rowe as \\"one of the giants in the field of science education and clearly looked upon as a leader.\\"  Works  Teaching science as continuous inquiry.

Business career Erceg soon returned to New Zealand to help with his ailing father's wine business in West Auckland. However, after a family disagreement over the direction of the wine company, Erceg left the company and formed Calypso Beverage Company Ltd in 1987. This business evolved to Independent Liquor. Erceg relied upon alternative marketing strategies to combat the larger players in the New Zealand alcohol industry. He provided incentives to their retail customers that helped them increase their profit margins. By 2005, Independent Liquor had become the third largest liquor distributor in the country with a 65% market share for RTD's. Independent Liquor was also exporting their products to 70 countries.

It is related to chatbots but mostly only uses rather simple interactions or no reactivity at all. The messages (e.g. tweets) it distributes are mostly either very simple, or prefabricated (by humans), and it often operates in groups and various configurations of partial human control (hybrid). It usually targets advocating certain ideas, supporting campaigns, or aggregating other sources either by acting as a \\"follower\\" and/or gathering followers itself. In this very limited respect, social bots can be said to have passed the Turing test. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/fashion/social-media-bots-offer-phony- friends-and-real-profit.html If the expectation is that behind every social media profile there should be a human, social bots always use fake accounts. This is not different from other social media API uses. Social bots appear to have played a significant role in the 2016 United States presidential electionBessi, A & Ferrara, E. (2016) Social Bots Distort the 2016 US Presidential election online discussion. First Monday 21(11), 2016 and their history appears to go back at least to the United States midterm elections, 2010. It is estimated that 9-15% of active Twitter accounts may be social bots and that 15% of the total Twitter population active in the US presidential election discussion were bots. At least 400,000 bots were responsible for about 3.8 million tweets, roughly 19% of the total volume. Twitterbots are already well-known examples, but corresponding autonomous agents on Facebook and elsewhere have also been observed. Nowadays, social bots are equipped with or can generate convincing internet personas that are well capable of influencing real people, although they are not always reliable.China kills AI chatbots after they start praising US, criticising communists Yahoo! News August 5, 2017 Social bots, besides being able to (re-)produce or reuse messages autonomously, also share many traits with spambots with respect to their tendency to infiltrate large user groups. Using social bots is against the terms of service of many platforms, especially Twitter and Instagram. However, a certain degree of automation is of course intended by making social media APIs available. The topic of a legal regulation of social bots is currently discussed in many countries, however due to the difficulty of recognizing social bots and separating them from \\"eligible\\" automation via social media APIs, it is currently unclear how that can be done and also if it can be enforced. In any case, social bots are expected to play a role in future shaping of public opinion by autonomously acting as incessant and never-tiring influencer. Uses Lutz Finger identifies 5 immediate uses for social bots: *foster fame: having an arbitrary number of (unrevealed) bots as (fake) followers can help simulate real success *spamming: having advertising bots in online chats is similar to email spam, but a lot more direct *mischief: e.g. signing up an opponent with a lot of fake identities and spam the account or help others discover it to discreditize the opponent *bias public opinion: influence trends by countless messages of similar content with different phrasings *limit free speech: important messages can be pushed out of sight by a deluge of automated bot messages The effects of all points can be likened to and support methods of traditional psychological warfare and information warfare. Detection The first generation of bots could sometimes be distinguished from real users by their often superhuman capacities to post messages around the clock (and at massive rates). Later developments have succeeded in imprinting more \\"human\\" activity and behavioral patterns in the agent. To unambiguously detect social bots as what they are, a variety of criteria must be applied together using pattern detection techniques, some of which are: *cartoon figures as user pictures *sometimes also random real user pictures are captured (identity fraud) *reposting rate *temporal patterns *sentiment expression *followers-to-friends ratio *length of user names *variability in (re)posted messages Botometer (formerly BotOrNot) is a public Web service that checks the activity of a Twitter account and gives it a score based on how likely the account is to be a bot. The system leverages over a thousand features. An active method that worked well in detecting early spam bots was to set up honeypot accounts where obvious nonsensical content was posted and then dumbly reposted (retweeted) by bots. However, recent studies show that bots evolve quickly and detection methods have to be updated constantly, because otherwise they may get useless after a few years.

Although initially short-lived, the band is still renowned for its live performances, showcasing a style combining influences from 1960s garage rock and Detroit's proto-punk scene. In the mid-1980s, the Enigmas released two EPs, appeared on the cult classic compilation album It Came from Canada, Vol. 1 and the compilation album It Came from From the Pit. Following their disbandment, the group continues to reunite for occasional shows. Paul McKenzie (lead vocals saxophone), Mike Davies (lead guitar) and Brian Olinek (bass guitar) originally came together in Vancouver's blossoming punk rock scene with a shared interest in garage rock and sixties instrumentals. At first, they busked outside liquor stores as the Bone-a-Partes. However, when the band discovered a French garage rock act had already appropriated the name, McKenzie suggested renaming themselves the Enigmas. In March 1982 they hired Cam Beck (drums) and the band played their debut gig at the Smilin' Buddha with the Greasy Spoons, one of McKenzie's former groups. During the peak of their popularity, the Enigmas were one of the most frequented attractions in Vancouver's underground music scene. The group developed a blend of garage rock and Detroit proto-punk sensibilities with a repertoire that encompassed cover versions of classic 1960s garage songs by the 13th Floor Elevators, the Sonics, and the Balloon Farm among others, as well as some self-penned material. In concert, the Enigmas' act was highlighted by frontman McKenzie's high-energy theatrics, having adopted a similar style to Iggy Pop. Beck left the band in May 1982, but was replaced by veteran drummer Randy Bowman, who arrived shortly after his former group, the Subhumans, disbanded. By late 1982, the Enigmas began touring into Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, garnering a wider following as the group performed in front of new audiences. The band self-produced a five-song, eponymous EP in 1983, which included unusually high-quality production and the cult-favorite track Teenage Barnacle. More of a \\"learning process\\" than a serious project, the Enigmas were eager to record another EP. After touring the West Coast they recorded Strangely Wild in 1985, after enticing Zulu Records to release the record. To promote the release, the Enigmas toured out to Montreal with NoMeansNo and appeared on the compilation albums It Came from Canada, Vol. 1 and It Came from From the Pit. However, by 1986 after Olinek left the band the group disbanded to work on other projects including The Scramblers, Earthling and TT Racer. As early as 1987, the Enigmas performed reunion gigs with the original recording line-up. By 1989 a new song about Charles Manson recorded to tape at rehearsal was released on Nardwuar The Human Serviette's compilation Oh God, My Mom's On Channel 10!. In 1992, McKenzie formed the successful Celtic punk band the Real Mckenzies. In 2010 the Enigmas reunited without Olinek, who had relocated, but with Stephen Hamm (Slow, Tankhog) on Bass and released a live album of the show on DVD. More reunions followed, including a DVD release party in 2014 and the Khatsahlano Festival Main Stage in 2015. with Adam Payne from The Badbeats on bass. More shows are planned for the fall of 2019.

(Congdon) Quick House is a private house located at 120 North Center Avenue in Gaylord, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History James A Quick James A. Quick was one of the prominent citizens of Gaylord. He was born in Oakland County, Michigan, on October 7, 1857, and worked on his father's farm until he moved to the Gaylord area in 1881, following his older brother Charles who had moved to the area two years earlier. The two established a livery barn located across the street from where this house now stands. They operated the barn until 1891, after which the brothers started a mercantile business in Gould City, Michigan. They returned to Gaylord in 1895 and opened a new Quick Brothers store. The brothers partnered with Almon Comstock and established a hardware store, a bank, and were active in real estate. James and Charles Quick purchased the lot this house sits on in 1890. James Quick constructed a house on the lot in 1900, but did not buy out his brother's interest until 1903. In 1902, James Quick suffered an illness that caused him to withdraw from his business, although he did later serve as a village trustee. He lived in this house until his death in 1909. James' wife Lottie took over his business after his death in 1909, as well as running a millinery store she had opened in 1906. However, by 1912 she had sold her Gaylord business, opened a new millinery store in Detroit, and moved to that city, although she continued to manage the Quick businesses in Gaylord. The Quick house remained vacant for a year, and in 1913 Dr. Harry Knapp purchased the it, intending to use it for his residence and medical office. Knapp constructed a separate patient entrance to the house. In 1919, the dentist Dr. William Housen moved into the house. and in 1921 another dentist, Dr. Charles Saunders, purchased the house. Saunders both lived in and practiced dentistry out of the house for a time, but by 1936 had relocated his practice downtown. In about 1950 he constructed an addition to the house. Saunders lived in the Quick house until his death in 1970. His wife Helen continued to live in the house until her death in 1999. The house has been vacant since that time. Applegate Building purchased the house in 2013 and as of 2016 plans to rehabilitate it into a restaurant. Description Quick House in 1905 The Quick house is a two-story cross-gable hipped roof wood frame Queen Anne home, with clapboard siding and decorative shingling, constructed in 1900. It sits on an uncoursed fieldstone foundation, and is roofed with faux diamond slate asphalt shingles applied over cedar shingles. The front of the house features a wraparound hipped roof open porch, with a turned-baluster railing that spans the entire facade. The opening to the porch is framed by Tuscan columns. One bay of the porch was enclosed in the mid-twentieth century to form a sunroom. The original wood front door is still on the porch, near a large window. Above the porch is a second-story balcony. The gable above is shingled, and to either side displays a large one- over-one double-hung window. The interior of the house is substantially original. The first floor woodwork is primarily tiger maple, and has never been painted. The original wood flooring is in place throughout the house, save for the kitchen and bathrooms. The entryway, dining room, and front parlor have wood floors finished in concentric squares with alternating maple and oak wood planks. The second story wood trim is pine. The house also has its original cast iron floor and wall registers and plaster on wood lathe walls.
