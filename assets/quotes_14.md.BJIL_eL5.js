Life and career Born in Milan as Alma Franca Maria Norsa, she managed to survive the Holocaust in Milan with her non-Jewish mother due to a fake I.D. which purported her to be the illegitimate daughter of a gentleman from Pavia. Her Jewish father and brother were able to flee to Switzerland.Interview with Franca Valeri (Kolot, 23 giugno 2014). Since her father did not want her to become an actress, Norsa adopted the stage name Valeri in the 1950s as suggested by a friend of hers who was reading a book by French critic and poet Paul Valéry. Valeri started her career on stage in 1947, and in 1949 she co-founded the Teatro dei Gobbi, along with Luciano Salce and her future husband Vittorio Caprioli. On the radio, she created and played the characters of La signorina Snob (Mrs. Snob), Cesira la manicure and Sora Cecioni. She co-starred in such films as A Hero of Our Times (1955), The Sign of Venus (of which she co-wrote both the story and the screenplay), and Il vedovo, as well as others. She often wrote her scenes in the films she starred, even those where she played small roles. Among the major films she co-wrote, Parigi o cara (1962) is a rare case where the story is focused on her role only. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Valeri also frequently worked for the Italian TV. Directed by Antonello Falqui, she starred in Studio Uno, Le divine and Sabato Sera. In the 1980s and early 1990s she starred in a series of commercials for Pandoro Melegatti, which were well received and stretched over a number of years (Pandoro being a seasonal product tied to the Christmas holidays). During the 2005–2006 theatrical season, she performed her own monologue, La Vedova di Socrate (\\"Socrate's Widow\\"), and Les Bonnes, by Jean Genet. In January 2008 she played the role of Solange in Les Bonnes at Milan's Piccolo Teatro. On 8 May 2020 Valeri received an Honorary David di Donatello Award. Valeri turned 100 on 31 July 2020 and died nine days later, on 9 August 2020.È morta Franca Valeri, addio alla comicità femminile che sapeva graffiare: aveva appena compiuto 100 anni https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/franca-valeri-dead-italys-pioneering- comic-actor-dies-at-100-1306590 Filmography = Actress =  Cinema  *Luci del varietà (1951) – Mitzy, Hungarian designer *The Two Sergeants (1951) *Toto in Color (1952) – Giulia Sofia *Solo per te Lucia (1952) *Villa Borghese (1953) – Elvira (segment Concorso di bellezza) *Questi fantasmi (1954) *Le signorine dello 04 (1955) – Carla, shift manager *The Sign of Venus (1955) – Cesira *Piccola posta (1955) – Lady Eva *Il bigamo (1956) – Isolina Fornaciari *Un eroe dei nostri tempi (1957) – De Ritis' widow *Mariti in città (1957) – Olivetti *La ragazza del palio (1958) – countess Bernardi *Non perdiamo la testa (1959) – Beatrice *Il moralista (1959) – Virginia *Arrangiatevi!

From left to right: Shenzi, Scar, Ed, Banzai, Rafiki, Mufasa, Simba, Sarabi, Zazu, Timon, and Pumbaa. Bottom right: Nala and Sarafina This page lists the characters appearing in Disney's The Lion King franchise. Introduced in The Lion King (1994) =Simba= Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick as adult Simba in the films, Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a cub in The Lion King, Matt Weinberg as a cub in The Lion King 1½, Cam Clarke in Timon & Pumbaa, Rob Lowe in The Lion Guard, Donald Glover in the 2019 film, JD McCrary as a cub in the 2019 film) is the son of Mufasa and Sarabi, Scar's nephew, Nala's mate, and Kiara and Kion's father. After defeating Scar, Simba takes Mufasa's place as King of Pride Rock before marrying Nala and having Kiara and Kion with her. His name means \\"lion\\" in Swahili which is his species. In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Simba is an overprotective parent of Kiara, and obtains a great hatred of the Outsiders, a group of lions whom he exiled due to their loyalty to Scar, specifically Scar's protege Kovu, before learning to let go of his hate, and accepting Kovu as his son-in-law. In The Lion Guard, Simba fathers Kion, and initially refuses to accept Kion's decision to allow non-lion animals into the Lion Guard, but later accepts his proposal. Currently in the show, after a failed attempt on Simba's life, orchestrated by the spirit of Scar, Simba and Kion plot to defeat him once again and for all. As of season 3, Scar's ghost has been defeated and his followers have become neutral under the rule of Jasiri, who becomes the new Outlands' leader. However, due to a facial wound caused by a snake bite during the battle, Kion journeys to find the Tree of Life, to get healed. Simba bids his son farewell on his trip. He later welcomes Kion home following his journey and accepts his love to Rani of the Night Pride. =Nala= Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly in the films, Niketa Calame as a cub in The Lion King, Gabrielle Union in The Lion Guard, Beyoncé in the 2019 film, and Shahadi Wright Joseph as a cub in the 2019 film) is the daughter of Sarafina, the best friend and later mate of Simba; she is also Kiara and Kion's mother. Although she is a prominent character in The Lion King, she makes minor appearances in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, The Lion King 1½, and The Lion Guard. In The Lion King, she is portrayed as Simba's childhood friend. Her name means \\"gift\\" in Swahili. After helping Simba enter the elephant graveyard, she has to be rescued by Mufasa when the hyenas attack them. Several years later, Nala encounters Simba as a young adult and develops a romance with him. After returning to Pride Rock, she helps Simba defeat Scar and take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock. In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Nala is depicted as slightly older, calmer, and less overprotective of Kiara than her mate, Simba. =Timon and Pumbaa= Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane in the films and the TV series Timon & Pumbaa, Quinton Flynn in earlier episodes of the TV series Timon & Pumbaaa, Kevin Schon in both later episodes of the TV series Timon & Pumbaa and The Lion Guard, Bruce Lanoil in the video games, Billy Eichner in the 2019 film) and Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella in the films, TV series Timon & Pumbaa, and The Lion Guard, Leslie Hedger in Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure, Seth Rogen in the 2019 film) are a meerkat and common warthog duo; Timon being a wise-cracking, yet loyal friend, while Pumbaa is gluttonous, yet brave. When they first meet Simba in The Lion King, they save an unconscious Simba from a flock of vultures. They take him in and bring him to their home in an oasis. Later, after Simba grows up and returns to the Pride Lands to battle Scar, they help Simba stop Scar's tyrannical reign and the two become Simba's royal advisors. Although they are supporting characters in the first two films, they are featured as the main characters in The Lion King 1½ as well as in the TV series Timon & Pumbaa. As revealed in the TV series The Lion Guard, they are the adoptive uncles of the honey badger Bunga and make their home at Hakuna Matata Falls. In the live-action film, Timon and Pumbaa had different animals as their neighbors in the oasis like a flock of guineafowl (one of them is voiced by Amy Sedaris), a galago (voiced by Chance the Rapper), an elephant shrew (voiced by Josh McCrary), a topi (voiced by Phil LaMarr) that has an awkward conversation with Simba, a bat-eared fox, an aardvark, a greater kudu, some dik-diks, and some Thomson's gazelles. =Scar= Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons in The Lion King, Jim Cummings in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride and The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure, James Horan in Kingdom Hearts II, Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure, and Sorcerers Of The Magic Kingdom, David Oyelowo in The Lion Guard, Chiwetel Ejiofor in the 2019 film) is the main antagonist of The Lion King franchise. He is a black-maned lion who is Simba's paternal uncle and Mufasa's younger brother. His name means \\"kovu\\" in Swahili, similar to his adoptive son. In The Lion King, by murdering Mufasa and exiling Simba, he becomes \\"King of the Pride Lands\\". However, years later, Simba returns to Pride Rock and overthrows Scar to become King of the Pride Lands. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas. In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride it is revealed that Scar's protege were exiled from Pride Rock by Simba in the wake of Scar's death, with Scar's most loyal follower, Zira, being the leader. Scar is mentioned several times by the characters, but makes two cameos. His first appearance is during Simba's nightmare, where he morphs into Kovu, and throws him into the stampede that killed Mufasa, in a similar manner to the first film. His second appearance is during Kovu's exile in which Kovu looks into his reflection and instead of his, he sees the image of his adoptive father. At the end of the film, Kovu marries Kiara, Simba's daughter and Scar's great niece, and becomes Simba's son-in-law and successor, so thus Scar's goal of Kovu becoming King would eventually come through following Simba's death or abdication to the throne, but not by avenging his death by murdering Simba. The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar reveals that Scar was once the leader of the titular group and once possessed the Roar of the Elders. Scar lost the Roar after using it to destroy the other members of his Lion Guard, as the Roar is meant to be used for good and not evil. In season 2 of The Lion Guard, Kion unknowingly summons Scar back as a fiery spirit in a volcano after using the Roar in anger when Janja the hyena provokes him. Scar then conspires with the animals in the Outlands to take over the Pride Lands and defeat the new Lion Guard and Simba, who were initially unaware that Scar had returned. Later in the season, Kion and the guard find out that Scar has returned, while they are in the Outlands getting volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. In the season 3 premiere Battle for the Pride Lands, Scar continues to battle the Lion Guard, who are now adolescents. At the end of Battle for the Pride Lands, Kion summons the Great Kings of the Past to rain upon Scar, thus destroying him once and for all. In the live-action film, Scar told Zazu to get help to rescue Simba while he goes to help him. This was a cover-up so that Scar can kill Mufasa. When Mufasa is dead and Simba has fled, Scar takes over as the ruler of the Pride Lands while allowing the hyenas to work with the lions. This led to overhunting. When Sarabi refuses to become Scar's mate, Scar makes things worse by having the hyenas eat first and they don't leave much behind. By the second advancement, Scar struck down Sarabi when she mentioned Mufasa. Like the films, Scar fought Simba and tried to blame Mufasa's death on the hyenas. When Scar is thrown off of Pride Rock, he survived the fall and was confronted by the hyenas. Scar states to them that if they build an army, they'll retake the Pride Lands. Azizi and Kamari state that they heard the insult towards them. Scar claims that he was trying to fool Simba. Shenzi states to Scar that he was right about a hyena's belly never being full. Scar strikes at some of the attacking hyenas until they swarm over him and kill him. =Mufasa= Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones in the films, Gary Anthony Williams in The Lion Guard) is Scar's older brother, Sarabi's mate, Simba's father and Kiara and Kion's paternal grandfather who is introduced as the King of the Pride Lands. The name \\"Mufasa\\" has an unknown origin, previously attributed to a fictional language called Manazoto. Mufasa is depicted as a just, wise, and responsible leader, a gentle but firm father, and strong and fierce protector when sufficiently provoked. In The Lion King, he teaches Simba on what a king is supposed to be, and how the king is responsible for protecting and maintaining the delicate balance of the ecosystem, and mediate problems between its creatures. However, Mufasa later dies after being thrown into a wildebeest stampede by Scar while rescuing Simba. He returns years later as a spirit in the clouds to encourage an older Simba return to the Pride Lands and reclaim his rightful throne. In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, he instructs Rafiki to bring Kiara, Simba's daughter, and Kovu, Scar's heir, together to reunite the two lion prides. In The Lion Guard, Mufasa serves as a spirit guide to his grandson Kion when he needs advice, and sometimes appears on his own when he notices he is troubled by something. When Kion is a teenager, Kion fights against Scar's spirit and his army, winning, but gets bit by Ushari, who gave him a scar on his eye. As a result, during the journey to the Tree of Life, the adolescent lion stops communicating with his grandfather due to issues with his scar and personal concerns about turning evil like Scar, and Mufasa became worried that he forgot about him, just like Simba did years ago when he became adult. When they finally talk again, Mufasa reassures Kion that he would always be here for him no matter what, showing that regardless of his grandson's scar, he still loves him dearly. Alongside Askari and the previous queen of the Tree of Life, Janna, he proudly watches over Kion after his marriage with Rani. Jones reprised his role in the pilot episode, but the character was voiced by Gary Anthony Williams in subsequent appearances. Lion King Directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff have described Jones's voice as powerful and similar to the roar of a lion. Jones reprises his role in the 2019 remake of the film directed by Jon Favreau. According to Favreau, Jones's lines remain mostly the same from the original film. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Scar in the film, said that \\"the comfort of [Jones reprising his role] is going to be very rewarding in taking [the audience] on this journey again. It's a once-in-a- generation vocal quality\\". =Sarabi= Sarabi (voiced by Madge Sinclair in The Lion King, Alfre Woodard in the live-action film) is Mufasa's mate, Simba's mother and Kiara and Kion's paternal grandmother. Her name means \\"mirage\\" in Swahili. In The Lion King, she serves as the Queen of Pride Rock. Years after Scar usurps the throne, Sarabi helps Simba fight against Scar and his hyenas. When Simba defeats Scar, Nala becomes Queen and Sarabi becomes the Queen Dowager. In the live-action film following Mufasa's death, Scar tries to get Sarabi to be his mate; however, she turns down his advances. =Sarafina= Sarafina (voiced by Zoe Leader in The Lion King, Penny Johnson Jerald in the 2019 film) is a lioness who is Nala's mother. She is first seen sleeping inside Pride Rock with Nala and the rest of the pride. She later cleans Nala before the latter leaves to go to the Elephant Graveyard with Simba. She makes her final appearance mourning the loss of Mufasa and Simba, unaware that Simba is still alive. In the live-action film, Sarafina's role is still the same. When the hyenas arrived at Pride Rock following Mufasa's death, Sarafina told Nala to stay close to her. =Zazu= Zazu (voiced by Rowan Atkinson in The Lion King; Jim Piddock in Timon and Pumbaa's Jungle Games and The Lion King Simba's Mighty Adventure; Michael Gough in Timon & Pumbaa; Edward Hibbert in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1½; Jeff Bennett in The Lion Guard; John Oliver in the 2019 film) is a red- billed hornbill and majordomo to Mufasa and later Simba. After Mufasa's death, Zazu becomes a prisoner of Scar before Pumbaa breaks the bone cage releasing him when Simba returns to the Pride Lands. He eventually acts as a scout and advises Simba on royal protocol. In Timon & Pumbaa, it is revealed that Zazu is not only a lion king's majordomo, he is a jungle administrator. In the episode \\"Zazu's Off-By-One Day\\", he is shown to be responsible for counting the population of the animals. In the musical, Zazu is a puppet controlled by an actor dressed in blue striped clothes and a bowler hat, much like a stereotypical butler. Zazu's blue feathers have been replaced with white and the puppet is partially constructed from parachute silk with a slinky contained in the neck for ease in movement. Also appearing in the 2019 remake of The Lion King, Zazu plays the same role as in the original version, but this time, he is introduced to Timon and Pumbaa and helps out in the battle by pecking Kamari numerous times. =Rafiki= Rafiki (voiced by Robert Guillaume in the animated films and Timon & Pumbaa; Khary Payton in The Lion Guard; John Kani in the 2019 film), whose name means \\"friend\\" in Swahili, is a mandrill with an unnaturally long tail. He lives in a baobab tree in the Pride Lands and performs shamanistic services for the lions of Pride Rock. He's also shown to be a great martial artist. In The Lion King, Rafiki is introduced in the opening scene when he travels to Pride Rock to perform newborn Simba's presentation ceremony. During the film, Rafiki sings a nonsense chant: \\"Asante sana, squash banana, wewe nugu, mimi hapana.\\" This is a Swahili playground rhyme which translates to \\"Thank you very much (squash banana), you're a baboon and I'm not!\\" Like \\"hakuna matata\\" (no worries), the chant was heard by the filmmakers on their research trip to Kenya. Rafiki travels to the jungle where Simba lives with Timon and Pumbaa, and teaches him lessons about learning from the past: \\"Yes, the past can hurt but, the way I see it you can either run from it, or learn from it\\" and then whacks him with his stick. During the battle for Pride Rock, Rafiki saves Simba from Banzai by whacking him with his stick, while fighting many more hyenas. At the end of the film, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub. In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Rafiki is more closely involved with the affairs and politics of the pride and is often seen with the lions. Mufasa's spirit persuades him to bring Simba's daughter Kiara and Zira's son Kovu together as a way of uniting the Outsiders with the pride. Rafiki tries to make them fall in love by singing to them about a place called \\"Upendi\\", which means \\"love\\" in Swahili. In the end, he blesses the union of Kovu and Kiara, and Kovu is welcomed into the pride. Rafiki appears briefly in The Lion King 1½, teaching Timon the philosophy of \\"Hakuna Matata\\", talking to Timon's mother about her son, and later convincing Timon to follow Simba to Pride Rock to confront Scar. In the musical, the character of Rafiki was significantly modified. Because director Julie Taymor felt that the story lacked a strong female character, Rafiki was changed into a female mandrill and sangoma. She acts as narrator throughout the story, at one point speaking to the audience in a click language for comic effect. She sings the opening song \\"Circle of Life\\", a keening song called \\"Rafiki Mourns\\" following Mufasa's death, and a brief part in Nala's song \\"Shadowland\\", when she blesses Nala for her journey to find help. Instead of detecting Simba's scent on dust, Rafiki hears Simba's song \\"Endless Night\\" on the wind. Rafiki finds Simba and shows him that his father lives on in him through the song \\"He Lives in You\\". She is present during the battle, fighting a hyena, and adorns Simba with the king's mantle after his victory; the play ends with her at the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub. Rafiki serves as a supporting character in the Timon and Pumbaa TV series, as well as a main character of said series as he has his own segments called \\"Rafiki Fables\\", where his shamanism is expanded. In the episode \\"Good Mousekeeping\\", it is revealed that Rafiki can grant wishes and can even take some of the wishes back. In another episode \\"Rafiki's Apprentice\\", Rafiki's stick is revealed to have magical powers. He explains to his nephew Nefu (voiced by Tahj Mowry) that the gourds on his stick are powerful for his magic. Rafiki serves as a recurring character in The Lion Guard. Rafiki is a meetable character at the Disney Parks and Resorts along with Timon, and can be found in Adventureland and at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. =Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed= Shenzi (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg in the animated films; Tress MacNeille in Timon & Pumbaa and Kingdom Hearts II; Jennifer Lewis in Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom; Florence Kasumba in the 2019 film), Banzai (voiced by Cheech Marin in the animated films, Kingdom Hearts II, and Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom; and Rob Paulsen in Timon & Pumbaa) and Ed (voiced by Jim Cummings) are the three spotted hyenas who make up Scar's henchmen that reside in the Elephant Graveyard. After Scar promises them and the rest of their fellow hyenas that they will have food in return for them helping him get rid of his brother Mufasa and nephew Simba in order to become King of the Pride Lands, the three hyenas trigger the wildebeest stampede which kills Mufasa and then chase Simba out of the Pride Lands on Scar's orders. When Simba returns to Pride Rock, Shenzi and Banzai are defeated by Pumbaa. The three turn on Scar when the latter tries to blame them for Mufasa's death and the ruin of the Pride Lands, and lead the rest of the hyenas into eating him alive during a wildfire, where they are engulfed by the surrounding flames. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed serve as main characters and antiheroes in Timon & Pumbaa. They are given their own segments titled \\"The Laughing Hyenas\\" where they wander around the Serengeti looking for food. At the end of the episode \\"TV Dinner\\", the hyenas replace television host Martin Pardon, which may indicate that they are living a new life as directors and stars of the wildlife documentary show Kingdom of the Creatures, where they get fed during their new career. In later seasons, they made minor appearances trying to attack Timon and Pumbaa. In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, it was only mentioned by Nuka that the hyenas have left the Elephant Graveyard. However, in the original draft of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed were going to return as Zira's henchmen, with Cheech Marin reprising his role as Banzai from the original film despite presumably Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings were supposed to come back as Shenzi and Ed. Yet they were cut, presumably due to Scar's death being at the hands of the hyena trio. In The Lion King 1½, Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed act as the local predators who attack Timon's meerkat colony before their allegiance with Scar. Shenzi (voiced by Florence Kasumba) appears in the CGI remake complete with a different personality. She is portrayed as ruthless and cunning matriarch with no-nonsense attitude and air of authority. She is also shown to have a rivalry with Nala. Ed was renamed Azizi (voiced by Eric Andre), and Banzai was renamed Kamari (voiced by Keegan-Michael Key). Nevertheless, these two play largely similar roles to the original film, except Azizi (Ed) is able to talk. Like the film, Shenzi, Azizi, and Kamari heard the insult that Scar used on them. When Scar is defeated and the hyena pack confronts him, Scar states that they can retake the Pride Lands if they build an army. Azizi and Kamari state that they heard the insult he used on them. Scar claims that he was trying to fool Simba. Shenzi quotes \\"You're right about one thing Scar, a hyena's belly is never full.\\" The hyenas attack as Scar strikes at some of them before the hyenas swarm over Scar and kill him. In the original draft of the film, the hyenas were African wild dogs, referred to as \\"Cape dogs\\" in the film. Their species may have been changed to illustrate the strong rivalry and competition between lions and hyenas in real life, the competition being much stronger than between lions and other predators. =Gopher= Gopher (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a gopher who works for Zazu as an informant. In the film, he is seen warning Zazu that the hyenas have invaded the Pride Lands. Gopher appeared in two segments starring Zazu in Timon & Pumbaa. Introduced in Timon & Pumbaa (1995–1999) =Quint= Quint (voiced by Corey Burton) is a human who is Timon and Pumbaa's archenemy. He is a sneaky, muscular man with black hair, a pink nose, and a shaven face; he has varying roles. His wears different clothes in each episode because of the different jobs he has, but he is often seen wearing a hat. He also has different first names that show what his jobs are (in which they all happen to start with C). Quint is a con artist who tricks Timon into stealing a gold nugget Pumbaa found in the episode \\"Yukon Con\\", a criminal who stole a suitcase that has $1,290,000 in the episode \\"How to Beat the High Costa Rica\\", an evil clock inspector who wants to get revenge on a timekeeper in the episode \\"Swiss Missed\\", a French chef who wants to make Speedy the Snail an escargot in the episode \\"French Fried\\", etc. In the episode \\"The Pain in Spain\\", two Quints are seen together which may prove that there is more than one of him. In some episodes, Quint appears to be a respectable man with an honest job, but he still seems to annoy Timon and Pumbaa. Notably in season 2, Quint's face appears to be clean-shaven except in the episode \\"Klondike Con\\" when he becomes a gold thief. Also in the episode \\"Escape From Newark\\", his nose is the same color as his body for the first time. =Speedy the Snail= Speedy (voiced by Corey Burton impersonating Bing Crosby) is a talking grayish/bluish snail with a shiny red shell and a yellow fedora. Timon and Pumbaa plan to eat him at first, but his ability to speak and sing and his bon viveur, good-humored attitude gets him to become friends with them. Timon gives him the name \\"Speedy\\", because he thinks that it would be a brilliant incongruity. Speedy always finds himself in danger, such as becoming a French gourmet snail and an earring out of his shell, and it's always up for Timon and Pumbaa to save him. In the episode \\"The Man from J.U.N.G.L.E.\\", Speedy is revealed to be a superhero called Super Duper Hero X after Timon and Pumbaa were captured by his nemesis Chromosome Quint. Every episode featuring Speedy end with Timon and Pumbaa saying bye to Speedy when they return him home, a seagull capturing Speedy, and then Timon and Pumbaa trying to save him once again. Speedy also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode \\"Washington Applesauce\\". =Fred= Fred (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) is a meerkat who is Timon's other best friend back at the meerkat colony. He is a practical joker, employing such gags as the hand buzzer, the squirting flower, and the whoopee cushion. He also loved Timon's hyena jokes. When Fred visits Timon and Pumbaa, he pulls more practical jokes on the duo, such as impersonating Timon's mother or impersonating a Billy Goat guard. Timon and Pumbaa, however, don't find Fred's jokes very funny and they often overpower him. Aside from pulling practical jokes, Fred enjoys doing all sorts of activities, such as playing Turtle Tennis and Fishing for Flamingos. He also mentions that he and Timon have always gone Bowling for Buzzards. At the meerkat colony, Fred's duty was to guard the Duke Meerkat's castle, although on the day the Duke left the colony, he snuck away to get a snack and convinced Timon that it was now his chance to go on a date with Princess Tatiana. When the Duke banished Timon from the colony after a cobra kidnapped the princess, Fred's new duty was to guard the back gate, which indicates that he has been demoted for failing to protect the castle. Fred appears in a total of four episodes: \\"Tanzania Zany\\", \\"Mombasa- In-Law\\", \\"Once Upon a Timon\\", and \\"Mind Over Matterhorn\\". =Boss Beaver= Boss Beaver (voiced by Brad Garrett) is an ill-tempered and cantankerous beaver with a white hard hat. His lifestyle is the exact opposite of Timon and Pumbaa's Hakuna Matata lifestyle: Boss Beaver likes to work while Timon and Pumbaa like to relax. He owns a lumber mill and an amusement park called \\"Boss Beaver's Log Land\\". Boss Beaver also has three mottos: \\"Makuta Hamaka\\", which means \\"work real hard\\", \\"safety first\\" and \\"you break it, you buy it.\\" Boss Beaver's favorite quote is \\"I am Boss Beaver and the reason they call me Boss Beaver is that I am your boss and I am a beaver. Therefore, I am Boss Beaver.\\" In the episode \\"Amusement Bark\\", it is revealed that he has a mischievous son named Boy Beaver, who keeps breaking things at his amusement park and getting Timon blamed for it. Boss Beaver appears in a total of three episodes. He also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode \\"Washington Applesauce.\\" =Irwin= Irwin (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a clumsy, accident-prone penguin with a green scarf and a brown hat. Timon and Pumbaa befriend him at a boat stop in Antarctica when they see that he has two extra tickets for the duo to get on the ship. When Irwin leaves his home with the duo, it is shown that he has obviously injured all of his penguin \\"friends\\", as they are all seen wearing bandages. Timon dislikes Irwin's clumsiness, and tries to get rid of him by tricking him into playing a game of Hide-and-Seek. Irwin accidentally causes the boat to sink and Timon and Pumbaa run into him on an island. Timon confronts the penguin and he tricks him into playing another game and Irwin accidentally causes the island to sink. Irwin meets Timon and Pumbaa again at a Hakuna Matata Megamall. Due to his clumsiness, Timon and Pumbaa try to avoid him by hiding in various stores. Irwin appears in two episodes of the TV series, \\"Frantic Atlantic\\" and \\"Shopping Mauled\\". =Toucan Dan= Toucan Dan (voiced by Jeff Bennett) is a dangerously clever criminal mastermind lying toucan who wears a red fez. He is a convincing liar and impersonator and would also do anything to get someone in trouble. In his debut episode \\"I Don't Bolivia\\", he keeps tricking Timon into freeing him from his cage. Later in the episode, while Timon impersonates Toucan Dan in order to not be in trouble with the police, Toucan Dan impersonates Timon and this makes Pumbaa have to decide which one is the real Timon. Toucan Dan makes his second and final appearance in the episode \\"Alcatraz Mataz\\". In that episode, he frames Timon and Pumbaa for stealing a train car full of beak polish and the police throw them in jail. Angry at Toucan Dan, Timon and Pumbaa escape to catch the toucan and make him tell the truth. =Rabbit= Rabbit (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a large and tall pink hare who appears to be very annoying, tiring. He made his debut in the episode \\"Mojave Desserted\\". In that episode, Timon and Pumbaa save his life when he was drowning in quicksand and he decides to repay the duo hand and foot. Annoyed by Rabbit, Timon and Pumbaa hatch a plan to put themselves in danger and have Rabbit save them and then leave them alone. Rabbit makes his second and final appearance in the episode \\"Africa-Dabra!,\\" this time appearing as an unsympathetic and ruthless magician. After Timon pulls him out of a hat, he teams up with the meerkat to become part of his magic act, telling him that he has been looking for a partner for years. When he gets annoyed by Pumbaa ruining the magic acts, he breaks up Timon and Pumbaa's friendship. When Pumbaa finds out that Timon never truly said anything mean about him, he gets revenge on Rabbit by trapping him in a cage and later skinning him for his disguise. =Vulture Police= The Vulture Police (voiced by Townsend Coleman and Brian Cummings) are recurring characters. They make their first appearance in the episode \\"The Law of the Jungle,\\" where they arrest Timon for using the Forbidden Stick to scratch his back and take him to Judge Rhino, who gives a number of tests to see whether he's innocent or guilty. In the episode \\"Yosemite Remedy,\\" Timon and Pumbaa go to the police after a criminal raccoon steals their suitcase full of valuables. When they handcuff the thief, he tells them that he didn't steal Timon and Pumbaa's suitcase, he found it. The police let him go, but later arrest him again when they find out that he really stole the duo's suitcase while catching him in the act. In the episode \\"Alcatraz Mataz\\", the Vulture Police throw Timon and Pumbaa in jail after they were convinced by Toucan Dan that they stole the train car full of beak polish. After Timon and Pumbaa confront Toucan Dan, the police show up and realize that it was really Toucan Dan who stole the train car, so they arrest the toucan. However, they also throw Timon and Pumbaa back in jail since they escaped when they told them not to no matter if they were framed or not. The Vulture Police make a brief appearance in the episode \\"Wide Awake in Wonderland\\". =Cheetata and Cheetato= Cheetata (voiced by Rob Paulsen) and Cheetato (voiced by Jim Cummings) are a pair of sophisticated twin cheetahs, reminiscent of Warner Bros' Goofy Gophers, speaking in British accents and using similar phrases (\\"Indubitably,\\" \\"How very kind of you\\"). In order to tell them apart, not only do they have different voices, they also have different personalities: Cheetata appears to be more eager and aggressive while Cheetato seems more likely to think things through. The cheetahs first appear in the episode \\"Cooked Goose\\", where they are annoyed by Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed getting in the way of their wildebeest hunt, so they try sending them on various wild goose chases. They also appear in \\"Gabon with the Wind,\\" where they are convinced by Timon that he is going to catch Pumbaa for them, when he is actually going to find his friend so that they can both run away to safety. In the episode \\"Boary Glory Days\\", Timon and Pumbaa use Cheetata and Cheetato to play a game of Predator Tag. While the cheetahs are chasing Timon and Pumbaa, the duo outsmarts the brothers by having them jump over a mud pool and fall into it. =The Three Natives= The Three Natives (voiced by Jeff Bennett) are a trio of tribes who are really university students taking part in the \\"Be a Native\\" weekends. They have a leader (also voiced by Jeff Bennett) who is also a university student and who usually precedes what he says with \\"Bungala, bungala.\\" The natives first appear in \\"Boara Boara\\". This episode shows that they used to have a warthog king of the island, which is unknown what might've happened to him. Therefore, the natives might have not seen their king in a really long time. When Timon and Pumbaa visit the island, the natives mistake Pumbaa for their long-lost king and they make Timon his servant. Everything goes well until they make Pumbaa relight the fire and realize that he's an impostor when they see that he is unable to do so. After Timon and Pumbaa escape, the three natives shed their disguises upon getting tired of being hit by the leader's staff and return to the university. The leader orders them to return or else they'll lose their deposit. The natives also appear in the episode \\"New Guinea Pig,\\" where Pumbaa decides to trade his tusks to them. After they fail to get the tusks, the three natives shed their disguises and return to the university. In \\"Beast of Eden\\", the three natives are shown with their leader again where they steal a golden magic tooth that belongs to a beast and Timon and Pumbaa have to retrieve it from them. They also make a brief appearance in the episode \\"Mozam-Beaked\\" when Timon and Pumbaa go to Bora Bora to throw a woodpecker into the volcano. =Mr. Bear= Mr. Bear (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a grumpy, short-tempered, but nice grizzly bear, although he gets easily angered, such as when he is awoken from his nap or when someone gets his food order wrong. He also has a romantic interest in a beautiful supermodel named Leslie Lambeau (voiced by Grey DeLisle). He appears in seven episodes, from \\"Slalom Problem\\" to \\"It Runs Good\\". In the episode \\"Jailhouse Shock,\\" Mr. Bear becomes cell mates with Little Jimmy, who gets even with Timon and Pumbaa by taking advantage of him by convincing him that the duo hurt him so that he could beat them up. Mr. Bear starts to show compassion for Timon and Pumbaa in the episodes \\"Ready, Aim, Fire\\" and \\"Stay Away from my Honey!\\" In the former, he operated as Smolder the Bear (a parody of Smokey Bear) who dislikes fires and saves Timon and Pumbaa from being cooked on Quint's fire. =Tatiana= Tatiana (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the daughter of the Duke Meerkat and the princess of the meerkat colony. She only appears in one episode but she's vital for Timon's past. After Timon leaves his sentry duty post to prepare for his date with Tatiana, a king cobra enters the colony and kidnaps the princess, which makes everyone believe she's dead and which causes Timon to get banished. After Timon and Pumbaa meet for the first time, they see that Tatiana is still alive and rescue her from a cobra. When Tatiana returns to the colony with Timon and Pumbaa, Timon is offered her hand in marriage. When the Duke makes him choose between Tatiana or Pumbaa, he chooses to be Bestest Best friends with Pumbaa as they leave the Meerkat colony. Although \\"Once Upon a Timon\\" was meant to be Tatiana's only appearance, there is a female meerkat who bears a striking resemblance to her in the episode \\"Timon in Love\\". The only difference is that Tatiana has blond hair while the other meerkat has red hair, and she's not wearing a tiara. =Sharla= Sharla (voiced by Billy West) is a female warthog who is the leader of Pumbaa's former sounder as well as Pumbaa's former girlfriend. While she only appears in one episode, she is vital for Pumbaa's past. She and three other male warthogs of the sounder banished Pumbaa from the group due to his awful scent, which was appalling even by warthog standards. Years later, Sharla and the three warthogs carry around a big bag of bugs for the rainy season, but come across a flock of Guinea fowl, who are their natural enemies and nightmares. Due to the birds' abilities to remove their furs in just a few seconds, the warthogs refuge in a hut and make a distress call, which Pumbaa answers. When Pumbaa reunites with his sounder, he has Timon come up with ideas on how they can get rid of the Guinea fowl. However, none of Timon's ideas work, so Pumbaa suggests that he and Timon use the jeep so that they carry a fake bag of bugs (which have firecrackers inside) to distract the Guinea fowl while Sharla and the other warthogs leave the hut with the real bag of bugs. Although Sharla banished Pumbaa from the group, they still have romantic feelings for each other. When Pumbaa arrives at the hut, they tell each other that they have never forgotten one another. Sharla tells Pumbaa that he should stay with the group, but Pumbaa decides to continue living his Hakuna Matata lifestyle with Timon, which the female warthog understands. =Ned the Elephant= Ned (voiced by Frank Welker) is a high and mighty African bush elephant who thinks he's wonderful at everything. He seems to enjoy teasing Timon and Pumbaa when they fail at proving their worth to him. In the episode \\"Uganda be an Elephant\\", Timon states that Ned is the most popular guy in the jungle and Pumbaa decides to turn himself into an elephant in order to be popular as well. Although Ned is selfish and sarcastic, he gets a change of heart after Pumbaa rescues him and his hippo henchmen from falling off a cliff. In the episode \\"Unlucky in Lesotho\\", it is revealed that Ned has a Good Luck Club, which lost most of its members due to Ned bringing an unlucky jar into the club. Because he gets attacked by piranha upon falling into the river after a black panther cub crosses his path, Ned is never seen or heard from again after this episode, implying that he was devoured by the piranha. =Little Jimmy= Little Jimmy (voiced by Joe Alaskey) is a cute, yet dangerous bluebird. He is similar to Toucan Dan, with the fact that he is also a criminal mastermind and he can also be dishonest. He also has two voices: his fake cute, innocent voice to pass himself off as a hatchling and his criminal voice to show that he is truly an adult. Little Jimmy first appears in the episode \\"Nest Best Thing,\\" where he tricks Pumbaa into building a birdhouse for him, which is actually a hideout. The pigeon police show up and arrest Little Jimmy. In the episode \\"Jailhouse Shock,\\" Little Jimmy is cell mates with Mr. Bear. In order to get revenge on Timon and Pumbaa for turning him in, he tricks Mr. Bear into thinking that Timon and Pumbaa hurt him so that he could hurt them back. Introduced in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) =Kiara= Kiara (voiced by Neve Campbell as a young adult; Michelle Horn as Kiara when she is a cub in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride; Eden Riegel in The Lion Guard) is the daughter of Simba and Nala, and Kion's older sister. She has a cameo appearance in The Lion King and is a major character in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride and The Lion Guard. Kiara is also the granddaughter of Mufasa, Sarabi and Sarafina. Kiara is portrayed as a feisty, playful, and adventurous princess whom her over-protective father Simba easily fears for her safety. As a cub, Kiara befriends Kovu when playing at the Outlands where they work together to escape a group of crocodiles. Unfortunately, their friendship is cut short as they are separated by their respective parents. As a young adult, Kiara is rescued by Kovu as part of Zira's plan to avenge Scar's death, but the two lions eventually fall in love. When Kovu is exiled from the Pride Lands following Zira's ambush on Simba, Kiara helps him return to the Pride Lands to reunite the Pridelanders and Outsiders. Afterwards, she becomes Kovu's wife. In The Lion Guard Kiara is seen being trained by her parents to be Queen and has a subtle sibling rivalry with Kion. Years later, she is engaged to Kovu where she assists him in explaining to Kion on what happened while he was away and what happened to Zira. Simba names her and Kovu as his successor as the ruler of the Pride Lands. =Kovu= Kovu (voiced by Jason Marsden as a young adult, as well as both a cub and an adult in The Lion Guard; Ryan O'Donohue as Kovu when he is a cub) is the youngest child of Zira, the brother of Nuka and Vitani, and Scar's chosen heir. His name means \\"scar\\" in Swahili, similar to his adoptive father Scar. In his childhood, Kovu befriends Kiara, though this didn't last long as they are separated by their feuding parents. However, Kovu's newfound friendship with Kiara gives Zira the idea to use their friendship so that Kovu will have the opportunity to kill Simba. Since then, Zira trains Kovu to assassinate Simba and take his place as the king of Pride Rock. As young adult, Kovu rescues Kiara during a planned ambush and Simba reluctantly allows him to stay in the Pride Lands. While spending time with Kiara, Kovu begins to fall in love with her and thus, unable to bring himself to hurt Simba. However, after Simba is ambushed by the Outsiders and Nuka is killed, Simba mistakenly assumes Kovu to be behind the ambush and exiles him from the Pride Lands. Eventually, after Kovu reunites with Kiara and convinces the Pridelanders and Outsiders to stop fighting each other, Simba pardons Kovu and allows him to become his eventual successor. In The Lion Guard, Kovu appears with his family in their plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Kion learns from Kovu that Kiara knows him. Years later, Kion and the Lion Guard learn that Kovu and the rest of the Outsiders have rejoined Simba's pride following Zira's death. Simba names Kovu and Kiara as his successor as the ruler of the Pride Lands. =Outsiders= The Outsiders are a pride of offshoot lions that were loyal to Scar. After a failed takeover following Scar's death, Simba banished them to the Outlands. In The Lion Guard, they tried to invade the territory that Jasiri's clan lives in. Kion was hesitant to use the Roar of the Elders because of what it did to Scar. After being told by the rest of the Lion Guard that Scar used the Roar for evil, Kion defeated the Outsiders with the Roar of the Elders which sent them flying to the Outlands' termite mound area which became their base of operations. Zira Zira (voiced by Suzanne Pleshette in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Nika Futterman in The Lion Guard), meaning \\"hate\\" in Swahili, is the mother of Nuka, Kovu, and Vitani. She is Scar's most loyal follower, and plots to avenge Scar's death by forming the Outsiders. She takes advantage of Kovu's friendship with Simba's daughter Kiara, as part of her plan to assassinate Simba. When this plan failed due to Kovu's love for Kiara, Zira resorts to all-out war against Simba's pride. However, because of Kiara and Kovu's actions, Vitani and the other Outsiders realize that they'd rather join Simba's pride and turn against Zira who persists in her revenge. Attempting to attack Simba, Zira is intercepted by Kiara and falls into a flash flood to her death, despite Kiara's attempt to rescue her. Zira makes an appearance in The Lion Guard alongside Kovu, Nuka, Vitani, and the rest of her pride in the episode \\"Lions of the Outlands\\". She tries to convince Kion that using the Roar of the Elders against her and the other Outsiders would cause him to lose it just as Scar did, and to side with his fellow lions. However, Kion is eventually able to see through her deceptions and drives her and the others off with the Roar. Years later, her death was mentioned by Kiara and Kovu when the Lion Guard returned and met Vitani's incarnation of the Lion Guard. Zira was also originally going to be the mate of Scar so that their son had a claim to rule the Pride. However, this idea was scratched due to an incest theme that would happen with Kiara and Kovu, so they make Zira the most loyal supporter of Scar. Nuka Nuka (voiced by Andy Dick) is the eldest child of Zira and the older brother to Vitani and Kovu. His name means \\"stink\\" in Swahili. Jealous of Zira's apparent favouritism for Kovu, Nuka often attempts to gain his mother's approval. During the Outsiders' ambush, Nuka attempts to kill Simba to prove himself to his mother, but is crushed to death by the falling logs, though he finally gained the attention he longed for from his mother. Zira mourned her son's death and blamed Kovu for the incident. In The Lion Guard, Nuka assisted his mother in a plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Vitani Vitani (voiced by Jennifer Lien as an adult; Lacey Chabert as Vitani when she is a cub, as well as both a cub and an adult in The Lion Guard; Crysta Macalush for her cub form's singing voice) is the middle child and only daughter of Zira. Although she has a prominent appearance in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, she makes a cameo appearance in The Lion Guard. As a young adult, Vitani is Zira's strongest lieutenant, supporting and acting on her mother's violent plans. With Kovu and Kiara's help, Vitani and the Outsiders turn on Zira and join the Pridelanders to settle the feud between the two prides peacefully. After Zira's death, Vitani and the other Outsiders are pardoned by Simba and rejoin his pride. In The Lion Guard, Vitani assisted her mother in a plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Years later after she and her pride joined Simba's while Kion and his friends journeyed to the Tree of Life, Vitani formed her own Lion Guard in their absence where it was also mentioned what happened to Zira. As the future king's older sister, she believes that it is her responsibility to protect the Pride Lands. She proves herself worthy to become leader of the Lion Guard after she bravely challenges Kion despite not having the Roar of the Elders, thus revealing her heroic and honorable attributes thereby redeemed from her past villainy. Kion then bestows her the position and power of the leader of the Lion Guard. This allows Vitani to use the Roar of the Elders, and she and her Lion Guard are officially recognized as the new Lion Guard of the Pride Lands. Her name is a Swahili portmanteau of the words \\"Vita\\" (\\"War\\"), \\"Ni\\" (\\"I Am\\"), and \\"Shetani\\" (\\"She-Demon\\"); the portmanteau can be roughly translated to \\"I Am War\\" or \\"Demon of War\\". \\"Shetani\\" itself was originally her name in early drafts of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, but this was softened to \\"Vitani\\". Introduced in The Lion King 1½ (2004) =Ma= Ma (voiced by Julie Kavner) is Timon's mother. Generally encouraging and optimistic, she believes in Timon and convinces Uncle Max to give him a job as a sentry or look-out. After Timon fails in his duty, she remains convinced that he can still find a place in the colony, but when he insists that he has to go, Ma supports him. Later, she gets worried about Timon after speaking to Rafiki and searches for him. They finally reunite at Pride Rock and Ma helps in the battle against the hyenas by digging a long tunnel to trap them. After Simba becomes king with the death of Scar, Timon takes them and the entire meerkat colony to the jungle paradise which he and Pumbaa discovered. Ma is mentioned several times in Timon & Pumbaa and in The Lion Guard episode \\"Beware the Zimwi\\" by Timon, who claims that her cousin's friend knew an ox that was eaten by the Zimwi. =Uncle Max= Uncle Max (voiced by Jerry Stiller) is a prominent member of the meerkat colony and relative of Timon and Ma. He has grey head-fur and a very large nose. Max is a pessimist by nature and very paranoid, believing that a meerkat's fate is to be \\"food for other animals! Feared by nothing and eaten by all!\\" Max reluctantly agrees to let Timon be a sentry for the colony and attempts to train him for the job, but is nearly eaten by the hyenas when they attack. He is glad to see Timon go but ends up going with Ma to find him. Max appears again towards the end of the film, where he and Ma encounter Timon and Pumbaa at Pride Rock, and helps Timon get rid of the hyenas by digging a tunnel. Max finally believes in Timon, and after Timon takes the meerkats to his jungle paradise, Max teaches the meerkats tai chi. Introduced in The Lion Guard (2015–2019) =Kion= Kion (voiced by Max Charles) is the son of Simba and Nala. Sometime after Kiara's first encounter with Kovu, Kion is born as the second born son of Simba. In the series prequel and pilot The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar, Simba has Kion organize the titular guard along with Bunga, Beshte, Fuli, and Ono. As leader of the Lion Guard and second-born to the throne, Kion is gifted with a power called the Roar of the Elders which causes the great lion spirits of the Pride Lands past to roar with him. Kion is surprisingly mature for his young age, unlike his older sister or his parents when they were cubs. He is also kindhearted and has a strong sense of responsibility, and does not want to end up like his great-uncle Scar, who used the Roar for evil and thus lost it forever. He also demonstrates a strong yet open sense of discernment, which warms him to scavengers like Jasiri the hyena and her clan. However, more cunning neighbors such as Zira of the Outsiders and Reirei's jackal pack have used his trusting spirit to exert their will, only to be soundly subdued when Kion's instincts come into play. Sometimes, when he has doubts, he communicates with the spirit of his wise grandfather Mufasa, who gives him advice when he needs his help. By the end of the episode The Rise of Scar, Kion travels to the Outlands to save Kiara, and unknowingly summons Scar after he uses the Roar in anger when Janja threatens his family. Later in the season, Kion and the Lion Guard find out that Scar has returned while they are in the Outlands getting volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. Upon returning to the Pride Lands, Kion acknowledges to his team that they have a tough fight ahead, but remains confident that they will be able to defeat Scar. By the end of the season 3 premiere Battle for the Pride Lands, Kion manages to defeat Scar once and for all by summoning the Lions of the Past to destroy him with rain. However, in the process, Ushari, the venomous snake follower of Scar, attacks Kion, giving him a scar over his left eye and poisoning him. Kion and the Lion Guard then journey to find the Tree of Life to heal him. On the way to the tree, Kion often acts rude and aggressive and loses control of his Roar due to the venom inside his body. Because of his scar, Kion stopped talking to Mufasa out of shame because his scar makes him look like Scar. Once reaching the Tree of Life, Kion meets the protectors of the Tree of Life, the Night Pride, who guides him during his recovery process. While Kion is recovering, Kion becomes closer to and develops romantic feeling for Rani, the leader of the Night Pride, and later the queen of the Tree of Life. Only after being encouraged by her, he finally decides to talk to his grandfather again after several months and tells him he was afraid of facing him due to his scar and his concerns about turning evil like Scar, but Mufasa is understanding, telling Kion that he could have talked to him anytime and reminds him that he would always be there for him. After he is healed from the poison, Kion becomes unsure that he can lead the guard as he can't control the Roar, but then realized that he was already a great leader even without the Roar. This realization allows him to completely master the Roar under Askari's guidance. Kion and his friends returns to the Pride Lands after hearing Zira is planning to attack his pride, but finds the two prides have merged and Zira's daughter Vitani has formed her own Lion Guard in their absence. Kion decides to pass on the role of the Lion Guard and the Roar of the Elders to Vitani and her lionesses, ending his and his friends' Lion Guard. Kion and his friends then return to the Tree of Life where Kion marries Rani, making him the king of the Tree of Life and its protector together with his friends, joining the Night Pride as well. =Bunga= Bunga (voiced by Joshua Rush) is a honey badger, Kion's childhood best friend and the bravest member of the Lion Guard. He is also the adoptive nephew of Timon and Pumbaa. Bunga is shown to be very adventurous and he rarely acts serious or even sits still, as he is always on the move, working off boundless energy and enthusiasm, and makes even the most dire of situations into a fantastic time. Though this makes him a great friend and playmate, it lands him into trouble more often than not. According to Kiara, Bunga is \\"brave, bordering on stupid,\\" but a valued member of the Lion Guard nonetheless. In the finale, Bunga joins the Night Pride. =Fuli= Fuli (voiced by Diamond White) is a cheetah, one of Kion's friends and the fastest member of the Lion Guard, as well as its first female member. She is quite prideful in her running abilities and shows extreme delight for being able to outpace a pursuer of any species. Despite being friends with Kion, she is somewhat resentful of the lions for lording over the Pride Lands, was skeptical about Kion's Roar of the Elders, and hates water. Despite these negative traits, she was willing to join the Lion Guard with her friends to defend the Circle of Life when Janja and his clan invaded the Pride Lands. She is also the first female animal to ever serve in the Guard as mentioned in the season 2 special The Rise of Scar. In season 3, Fuli occasionally takes command of the Guard from Kion when his scar affects his rational thinking. In the finale, Fuli joins the Night Pride. =Beshte= Beshte (voiced by Dusan Brown) is a hippopotamus, one of Kion's friends and the strongest member of the Lion Guard. Being one of the most popular animals of the Pridelands, Beshte is shown to be kind-hearted. His friendliness extends to everyone, as he acts like a big brother to the younger members of his herd, a friend to animals of all different species, and a protector of the Pride Lands at large. Beshte can also, however, be sensitive, being especially tactful when his friend Kion is unable to use the Roar of the Elders. For an animal so large and full of life, Beshte has an appropriately large heart and never fails to treat his friends with kindness. In the finale, Beshte joins the Night Pride. =Ono= Ono (voiced by Atticus Shaffer) is a cattle egret, one of Kion's friends and the keenest of sight of the Lion Guard, as well as its only non- mammal member. He is one of the more easygoing members of the group, being friendly and group-oriented. He is used to spending time around other animals and is content to be part of the Lion Guard. Ono is also shown to be blunt, as he is able to lay out his feelings without sugar-coating. He is by far the most realistic member of the group, as he always thinks things through before jumping in. When it comes to his role on the Lion Guard, Ono is brave and has a knack for following the rules. He obeys Kion's orders without question and proves himself to be plucky and thrifty, considerably useful when it comes to scouting out a situation. His principles are clear in his willingness to fight with his full heart for the Circle of Life, and he is a valued member of the Lion Guard for his intelligence and ability to see things from afar. During the final confrontation against Scar, Ono saved Bunga from falling into volcano, consequently sucking too much smog that resulted with near loss of his vision. He gave up his position as the keenest of sight to Anga, but still remain as a member of the Lion Guard after Kion bestowed him the new title of the smartest. He joins the guard to find the Tree of Life in hope of curing his eyes. After reaching the Tree of Life, Ono begins his healing process and finally regains his sight, though it isn't as sharp as it used to be. In the finale, Ono joins the Night Pride. =Anga= Anga (voiced by Bryana Salaz) is a martial eagle who first appears in the season 2 finale, where she teams up with Ono to stop Mzingo's committee from setting fire to the Pride Lands. She is a serious and no-nonsense bird, giving her the impression that she's cold and unfriendly. In reality, she is kind and caring, and her cold exterior is just her way of being calm. Like most birds, she admires Hadithi to the point she hardly able to contain her excitement whenever he is involved, making it one of rare occasions Anga loses her composure. In season 3, she becomes a member of the Lion Guard following Ono's injuries during the battle for the Pride Lands, taking up his position as the team's keenest of sight. Anga's catchphrase is \\"Anga lenga\\", which means \\"Aim for the skies\\" in Swahili. In the finale, Anga joins the Night Pride. =Zuri= Zuri (voiced by Madison Pettis) meaning \\"beautiful\\" in Swahili, is a lioness cub and one of Kiara's friends. She appears to be vain about her appearance, as she constantly sharpens her claws on trees in order to keep them shiny. Unlike her friends, Zuri is delicate and timid. She shows considerable anxiety and fear in the face of simple circumstances and harbors deep disgust for grubs. =Tiifu= Tiifu (voiced by Sarah Hyland in season 1 and The Rise of Scar; Bailey Gambertoglio in season 2) is a lioness cub, and a friend of Kiara's. She is shown to be kind and patient, as seen when she comforts an overreacting Zuri. She is a great rule-follower and trusts the judgment of her friends, showing faith when she leaves Kiara to fetch help as Janja invades the Pride Lands. =Askari= Askari (voiced by Michael Luwoye) is a lion and the leader of the original Lion Guard who was the second-born of the unnamed king and queen and a distant relative of Mufasa, Simba, and Kion. His spirit teaches Kion about how the roar works during Kion's journey to the Tree of Life. =Night Pride= The Night Pride is a pride of Asiatic lions who protect the Tree of Life. * Rani (voiced by Peyton Elizabeth Lee, singing voice by Lana McKissack) – The leader of the Night Pride and love interest of Kion. She at first mistook the Lion Guard as intruders after Bunga accidentally causes a landslide and Kion accidentally lost control of his Roar that blew away her younger brother Baliyo, but eventually welcomed them under her grandmother Janna's insistence. Although her trust with the Lion Guard was strained after learning that they have unknowingly been followed by Makucha, Chuluun, & Ora, she reconciled with Kion and the Guard after they've worked together to fight the three predators off. Following the death of her grandmother, Rani becomes Queen of the Tree of Life. At the end of the series, she marries Kion. Her name means \\"Queen\\" in Hindi. Her and her Night Pride's catchphrase is \\"With strength & respect, Night Pride protect!\\" * Baliyo (voiced by Hudson Yang) – Baliyo is Rani's younger brother. His name means \\"Strong\\" in Nepali and \\"Powerful\\" in Hindi (bali) and his catchphrase is \\"Lada'i!\\", which means \\"Fight\\" in Hindi. * Surak (voiced by Lou Diamond Phillips) – Surak is Janna's second-born son and Rani and Baliyo's uncle. His name means \\"Clue\\" in Hindi and his catchphrase is \\"Jogina!\\" * Nirmala (voiced by Miki Yamashita) – Nirmala is the Night Pride's healer. She is the one who guides Kion in his recovery process. Her name means \\"Pure\\" in Hindi and her catchphrase is \\"Aramakaro.\\", which, in Hindi, is a word split in three parts (araam, aa, and karo) that means \\"come have some rest\\". According to both Nirmala & Baliyo, \\"Aramakaro\\" also means \\"Relax\\". * Janna (voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo) – Janna is the former queen of the Night Pride, mother of Sâhasí and Surak, and grandmother of Rani and Baliyo. She died of old age. In \\"Return to the Pride Lands,\\" her ghost is seen with the ghosts of Mufasa and Askari when Kion marries Rani with his Lion Guard agreeing to help the Night Pride protect the Tree of Life. Her name means \\"Paradise\\" in Arabic and \\"Life\\" in Hindi (jann). * Sâhasí (voiced by James Sie) – Rani and Baliyo's deceased father, Surak's older brother, and Janna's first-born son. His ghost appears where he gives advice to Rani. His name means \\"Brave\\" in Hindi. * Ãnanda (voiced by Grace Young) – Rani and Baliyo's deceased mother. Her ghost speaks to Rani together with Sâhasi where they gives advice to Rani. Her name means \\"Joy\\" in Hindi. =Janja's clan= Janja's clan is a small pack of male spotted hyenas that live in the Outlands. They are descendants of the hyenas from the original film. They are known to be the arch-enemies of The Lion Guard and serve as henchmen to Scar's spirit. However, as of season 3 they have betrayed Scar, joined the Pride Landers, and helped Kion defeat Scar once and for all. Afterwards, Janja merges his clan with Jasiri's as they work to keep the Outlanders in line. * Janja (voiced by Andrew Kishino) is the cunning and aggressive leader of the hyenas in the Outlands, descended from the hyenas from the original film and one of the main antagonists. In \\"The Hyena Resistance\\", Jasiri saves Janja from falling into a steam vent, and tells him that he and his clan are welcome to join her clan's hyena resistance to defeat Scar. After some hesitation, Janja dismisses her offer, but his hesitation causes Scar's skinks to question his loyalty and leaves Jasiri hopeful that he will come around eventually. In the season 3 opener Battle for the Pride Lands Janja reforms, and after the destruction of Scar, and the death of his minion Ushari, Janja nominates Jasiri to be in charge of the Outlands, foreshadowing some peace, as well as unifying both clans. * Cheezi (voiced by Vargus Mason) is one of Janja's right-hand henchmen. He is an excitable hyena who is usually seen sticking his tongue out. * Chungu (voiced by Kevin Schon) is one of Janja's right-hand henchmen. He is an unintelligent hyena who has a tough attitude and a slightly heavier build than the other hyenas. * Nne (voiced by Beau Black) is a stout but sly and smart hyena. Janja appointed him and Tano to become Cheezi and Chungu's replacement when Janja blamed them for the failure in their plan. However, Nne and Tano eventually ditched Janja as they're proven to be smarter than him and deemed their leader to be too stupid to carry out their plan, which was later foiled by the Lion Guard. * Tano (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) is a sloping, but devious, and smart hyena. Janja appointed him and Nne to become Cheezi and Chungu's replacement when Janja blamed them for the failure in their plan. However, he and Nne eventually ditched Janja as they're proven to be smarter than him and deemed their leader to be too stupid to carry out their plan, which was later foiled by the Lion Guard. =Mzingo's parliament= Mzingo's parliament is a parliament of white-backed vultures that live in the Outlands and is allied with Janja's clan to become members of Scar's army. Following Scar's defeat, Mzingo's parliament had to accept Jasiri as the leader of the Outlands. * Mzingo (voiced by Greg Ellis) is a vulture who is Janja's majordomo of the Outlands. He is the leader of a flock of vultures that later is allied with Janja's clan and Jasiri's clan. * Mwoga (voiced by Cam Clarke) is a foolish and clumsy vulture who is the spy of the parliament. =Jasiri's clan= Jasiri's clan is a clan of friendly hyenas that resides in the Outlands. Unlike Janja's clan, Jasiri and her hyena clan respect the Circle of Life and mostly scavenge for food. When Jasiri learns from Kion that Scar has returned, she and her clan form a hyena resistance to aid the Lion Guard and help defeat Scar. After the season 3 episode Battle for the Pride Lands Jasiri and Janja's clan have unified as one and rule the Outlands with Jasiri in charge as they work to keep the Outlanders in line. * Jasiri (voiced by Maia Mitchell) is a friendly female spotted hyena who makes her first appearance in the episode \\"Never Judge a Hyena By Its Spots.\\" Unlike most of her species, she is open to making friends with lions. Bold and spunky, Jasiri is able to look past differences and focus on where different species have common ground. Unlike Janja and his clan, she dislikes selfishness and gluttony, and she respects the Circle of Life. In \\"The Hyena Resistance\\" when Jasiri learns from Kion that Scar has returned, she and her clan form a resistance to aid the Lion Guard and help defeat Scar. In season 3, Jasiri accepts Janja and his clan as members of her clan, and after the defeat and destruction of Scar, Jasiri becomes the leader of the Outlands. * Madoa (voiced by Maisie Klompus) is a spotted hyena who is Jasiri's sister and is part of her clan. * Tunu (voiced by Crimson Hart) is a spotted hyena cub and brother of Wema who is part of Jasiri's clan. * Wema (voiced by Fiona Hart) is a spotted hyena cub and sister of Tunu who is part of Jasiri's clan. =Makini= Makini (voiced by Landry Bender) is a young mandrill who is Rafiki's new apprentice. She is free- spirited and loves to learn and look up to her mentor. However, she has trouble being calm and she is easy to deceive, which was the cause of Scar's resurrection. Despite this, Makini takes pride in herself and her position, and is friendly and welcoming to everyone she meets. She joins the Lion Guard on their journey to the Tree of Life, though she unintentionally reveals the Tree of Life's existence to Makucha. Following Queen Janna's passing, Makini is made Rani's Royal Mjuzi. =Vitani's Lion Guard= Vitani's Lion Guard are a group of lionesses who take the role of the Lion Guard during Kion & his Lion Guard's absence, due to their journey to the Tree of Life. Led by Kovu's sister Vitani who is the Fiercest member of her guard, her Lion Guard is the first Lion Guard to be led by a female lion, have all female members, and be led by the elder sibling instead of the younger (due to Kovu being the future king, despite being younger than Vitani, though Vitani is still a second born child). Once Kion and his Lion Guard returned, they and Vitani mistaken each other for enemies (with the former having received warning that Zira's pride is attacking the Pride Lands, unaware that the war was already over). However, after Kiara and Kovu stopped the fight, Kion and his allies are told what have happened, and Vitani realizes that it was Kion she was fighting, not recognizing him due to his scar. Although the initial battle was resolved, Vitani's guard and Kion's guard share a rivalry at first, but eventually become friends as time progressed. Besides Vitani, the rest of her Lion Guard consists of: * Shabaha (voiced by Fiona Riley) is the Bravest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, known for her level of insanity. Janja comments that her fighting style is similar to Bunga (much to the latter's liking); but whereas Bunga's bravery leaves him dimwitted, Shabaha's makes her slightly unhinged: she often laughs maniacally in the midst of a challenge. Her catchphrase is \\"Bila hofu!\\", which is Swahili for \\"Without fear!\\" * Kasi (voiced by Savannah Smith) is the Fastest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, noted to have Fuli's level of serenity. Though without the advantage of Fuli's cheetah speed, Kasi has more constant stamina (as she is a lion) and agility (in part due to her thin build). Her catchphrase is \\"Haraka, haraka!\\", which is Swahili for \\"Hurry, hurry!\\" * Imara (voiced by Rachel Crow) is the Strongest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, given her tenacity. With a stocky build, she proves nearly as strong as Beshte, as seen when she is able to slightly push back Beshte during their first encounter and when they are competing by pushing elephant-topped rocks. Her catchphrase is \\"Misuli!\\" (pronounced as \\"Musuli!\\"), which is Swahili for \\"Muscles!\\" * Tazama (voiced by Sophie Reynolds) is the Keenest of Sight in Vitani's Lion Guard, as well as a supportive team player. While not able to fly like Anga or Ono, Tazama is capable of seeing in darkness (something Anga and Ono cannot do) and has some level of Ono's tact (using his rules in the challenges against Anga). Her catchphrase is \\"Hiyo kali!\\", which is Swahili for \\"That's terrific!\\" =Reirei's pack= Reirei's pack is a family of black-backed jackals who first appeared in the episode \\"The Kupatana Celebration\\". They trick the Lion Guard into letting them into the Pride Lands so that they can devour all the animals. At Kupatana, the jackals attack the Pridelanders until they are defeated by the Lion Guard. Simba himself approaches the jackal pack and roars, sending them scurrying back into the Outlands. Reirei and Goigoi reappear in the episode \\"Too Many Termites\\", where they attempt to eat a pack of aardwolves, but are stopped by the Lion Guard. In season 2, they become members of Scar's army. Following Scar's defeat, Reirei's pack had to accept Jasiri as the Outlands' leader. * Reirei (voiced by Ana Gasteyer) is a clever, scheming, and manipulative jackal who is the matriarch of her family pack. * Goigoi (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is Reirei's mate who only thinks with his stomach and has the tendency to fall asleep. * Dogo (voiced by Jacob Guenther) is one of Reirei and Goigoi's sons who uses his innocent looks to his advantage to win the trust of others in order to take advantage of them. After Reirei and her pack joined Scar's army, Dogo and his siblings, including his sister Kijana, would not be seen again for a long time until the season 3 opener Battle for the Pride Lands. * Dogo's Siblings (voiced by Jacob Guenther and Dee Bradley Baker) are Reirei and Goigoi's sons and brothers of Dogo. After Reirei & her pack joined Scar's army, Dogo's siblings, along with Dogo himself & Kijana, would not be seen again for a long time until the season 3 opener Battle for the Pride Lands. * Kijana (voiced by Amber Hood) is Reirei and Goigoi's daughter. She had only made one major appearance in the Lion Guard, in the episode Babysitter Bunga. Like Dogo & his siblings, Kijana would not be seen again for a long time after Reirei and her pack joined Scar's army, but she eventually made appearance in the season 3 opener Battle for the Pride Lands. =Shupavu's Group= Shupavu's group are a group of skinks who are friends with Ushari and serve as his spies in the Pride Lands. Following Scar's defeat, Shupavu's group had to accept Jasiri as the leader of the Outlands. * Shupavu (voiced by Meghan Strange) is a sneaky skink who is the leader of the group. She dislikes being close to Pride Rock. * Njano (voiced by Ford Riley) is a crafty, blue-tongued skink who is Shupavu's second-in-command. * Nyeusi (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) is a stealthy black skink who is a member of the group. * Waza is an observant blue skink who is a member of the group. * Nyata is a swift purple skink who is a member of the group. =Ushari= Ushari (voiced by Christian Slater) is an Egyptian cobra who often conflicted with Bunga and would get disturbed whenever the Lion Guard was near him. In The Rise of Scar, Ushari finally gets fed up with the Lion Guard disturbing his peace and inadvertently finds out that Kion talks to Mufasa's spirit. With this knowledge he decides to join forces with Janja's clan and ends up helping them orchestrate the events that allow them to summon Scar's spirit so that he can guide them in defeating the Lion Guard. At the end of the season 3 opener Battle for the Pride Lands, Scar plots with Ushari to kill the Guard once and for all, as well as Janja, (after overhearing his hesitation on which sides to join). However, the plot fails, Janja betrays Scar, and a battle in the Outlands ensues. In a confrontation between Kion and Scar, Ushari attacks Kion, and gives him a scar on his left eye, similar to his great uncle's. Despite this, Kion manages to defeat and destroy Scar once and for all by summoning the Great Kings of the Past, who vanquish Scar with rainwater. Ushari, in disbelief and anger, makes one last attempt on Kion's life, but is thwarted by Bunga, and falls to his death in the lava below. =Aardvarks= The following aardvarks appear in The Lion Guard: * Muhangus (voiced by Khary Payton) is an aardvark and the leader of his shoal. * Muhanga (voiced by Russi Taylor) is an aardvark who is Muhangus's mate. =Aardwolves= The following aardwolves appear in The Lion Guard: * Mjomba (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a grumpy and impatient aardwolf who is the leader of the pack. He has a hunched back, bushy black eyebrows, gray fur, and darker gray markings. His inner ears are pink, and his nose is black. Like the rest of the pack, he adores termites. His name in Swahili means \\"uncle.\\" * Ogopa (voiced by Marieve Herington) is a bright and cheerful aardwolf. She has blue-gray fur and black markings, as well as a narrow muzzle and a black nose. Her yellow eyes are large and framed by a few eyelashes, and her inner ears are pink with a couple of hairs sprouting from each. Like the rest of the pack, she adores termites. She is easily frightened and has a tendency to jump to conclusions. She also tends to add afterthoughts after she states her opinion on a subject. * Haya (voiced by Ogie Banks) is a nervous and shy aardwolf. He has dark gray fur with longer fur on his cheeks and black markings, and his inner ears are pink with a few hairs sprouting from them. His upper teeth protrude from his dark muzzle. Like the rest of the pack, he adores termites. Like Ogopa, he tends to add afterthoughts after stating his opinion. =Arabian tahr= A group of Arabian tahr reside at the Tree of Life: * Cek (voiced by Jeremy Ray Valdez) is the leader of his herd. * Rama (voiced by Tiffany Espensen) is married to Cek. =Baboons= The following baboons, whether they be olive baboons or yellow baboons, appear in The Lion Guard: * Big Baboon (voiced by Ford Riley in Return of the Roar, Dee Bradley Baker in later appearances) is an olive baboon and leader of his troop. ** Gumba (voiced by Jacquez Swanigan) is a young olive baboon who is part of Big Baboon's troop. * Uroho (voiced by David Adkins) is a sneaky yellow baboon who is the leader of Traveling Baboon show. ** Mwevi and Mwizi (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) are a duo of yellow baboons who are part of Uroho's Traveling Baboon show. =Cape buffalo= * Vuruga Vuruga (voiced by Virginia Watson) a Cape buffalo who is the leader of her herd.

Rivers) is an elderly Nile crocodile who originally led the crocodile float, until he is defeated by Makuu in a \\"mashindano\\" battle for the position of alpha male. Upon defeat, Pua leaves the float. * Makuu (voiced by Blair Underwood) is a young, sleek, and well-built Nile crocodile who leads the crocodile float that lives in the Pride Lands after defeating the previous leader Pua in battle. He is shown to be boastful and loves to bask in the attention of others. Unlike his predecessor, Makuu initially has no respect for tradition or the Circle of Life, and certainly not for authority (except his own), seeing both Pua and Kion as weak and cowardly. He appears to only respond to strength and power, as he was awestruck by the Roar of the Elders and gave into Kion's second demand to leave Big Springs while trying to save face. In season 2, Makuu has decided to become a better leader for his float, reforming from his trouble- making ways. * Kiburi (voiced by Common) is a former member of Makuu's float. Much like a less experienced Makuu, he saw no reason why the crocodiles should have regard for the other animals of the Pride Lands. After the crocodiles were accidentally awakened from dry season aestivation by the Lion Guard, Kiburi led most of the float in an effort to seize bodies of water. He later challenged Makuu to a mashindano, having made an alliance with Ushari and a plan to eliminate Simba. Upon being defeated, he and his three supporters were expelled from the Pride Lands, and became a part of Scar's growing collective in the Outlands. In some later episodes of season 2 and the season 3 opener, more crocodiles have been known to be part of Kiburi's float in the Outlands. Following Scar's defeat, Kiburi reluctantly accepted Jasiri as the leader of the Outlands. **Tamka (voiced by Nolan North) is a brutish, yet unintelligent crocodile loyal to Kiburi. ** Nduli (voiced by Jorge Diaz) is an optimistic crocodile loyal to Kiburi. =Eagles= Besides Anga, the following eagle appears in The Lion Guard: * Hadithi (voiced by John O'Hurley) is a legendary African hawk-eagle who faked having invented the Hadithi Spin. =Elephants= The following elephants appear in The Lion Guard: * Ma Tembo (voiced by Lynette Dupree) is an adult African bush elephant with a broken right tusk, who attains leadership of her father Aminifu's herd after his death. Much like her father, she is always game for a laugh. Even when Simba makes a mistake at her father's funeral, she is gracious and kind, and makes light of the situation by dwelling on the good. She is similarly gracious to Nala and Kiara when they are the only members of their family to attend the elephant concert. Ma Tembo's herd resided in Kilio Valley until it was destroyed by a fire caused by the Outlanders in \\"The Kilio Valley Fire\\". ** Mtoto (voiced by Natalie Coughlin in \\"Bunga the Wise,\\" Justin Felbinger in later episodes) is an elephant calf who idolizes Beshte. He appears to be innocent with little understanding of the world.

His name in Swahili means 'buffoon'. His catchphrase in the tongue \\"Kusihi Ni Kucheka\\" means \\"To live is to laugh\\". ** Hafifu (Voiced by Phil Lester) is a juvenile mountain gorilla prince and brother of Majinuni who came to the Pride Lands to deliver a message to Simba.

He is colored blueish-grey and has canine teeth. After defeating the villainous outlanders, Shujaa also helped put out a wildfire and carried Beshte to safety. =Hippopotamuses= Besides Beshte, the following hippos appear in The Lion Guard: * Basi (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is a hippopotamus who is Beshte's father and leader of his and his son's pod. He is amicable and open, willing to engage in conversation and negotiate according to the customs of the Pride Lands. Even in the face of adversity, such as Makuu's violent takeover of Big Springs, Basi maintains his temper and graciously offers the crocodile a chance to return once the fish have returned in plenty. Being so learned in the ways of the animals, Basi is knowledgeable and wise. Despite being an animal with a very different way of life, he understands the customs of the crocodiles and how this affects his pod's everyday life. Unlike the inexperienced young Makuu, Basi grasps an understanding of the Circle of Life and how every animal must give and take in order to keep it in balance. * Bellow Fellows (voiced by Ace Gibson, Khary Payton, and Kevin Schon) are a group of hippos. * Kiazi is a hippopotamus calf. =Leopards= Several leopards appear in The Lion Guard. Most are antagonists while one is befriended by the Lion Guard: * Makucha (voiced by Steve Blum) is a cunning, powerful cream-colored male leopard who comes to the Pridelands in pursuit of the okapi Ajabu, and who proves to be quite an adversary to the Lion Guard due to his speed and strength. Makucha is later revealed to be the leader of his leap which is first shown when the Lion Guard was looking for water in the Back Lands during a water shortage in the Pride Lands. Makucha becomes the main antagonist of season 3, starting with the episode \\"The Harmattan\\". After hearing from Makini excitedly talking all about the Tree of Life and the rare animals, Makucha uses that info to make a new goal: sneakily follow the Lion Guard to the Tree of Life, so that he can feast on the rare animals.

Introduced in The Lion King books =Kopa= Kopa is the son of Simba and Nala, appearing in the book series The Lion King: Six New Adventures, and is shown to look a lot like his father as a cub, except with a tuft of hair on top of his head. He debuts in the story A Tale of Two Brothers, which served as a prequel to The Lion King. The books were released before the film's production had finished, and thus, Alex Simmons (Kopa's creator) did not know that Simba and Nala would be given a cub at the end of the film. In the 1995 commentary tract based on the film, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff describe the cub at the end of the first film as \\"Fluffy\\", therefore scrapping Kopa, and as a result, he is non-canon to the films. Kopa was also originally going to be the oldest of Simba and Nala. =Ahadi= Ahadi is the father of Mufasa and Taka (Scar), the grandfather of Simba, the great- grandfather of Kopa, and the king of the Pride Lands during the events of The Lion King: Six New Adventures story A Tale of Two Brothers.

He is the grandfather of Mufasa and Scar and the great-grandfather of Simba. He went to find water for the animals of the land during a drought and helped the animals get on with each other. When he died, he became a star which was brighter than the others. He is shown to look a lot like a darker furred version of Mufasa, having facial features like Simba's and was said to have been one of the greatest kings of the Pride Lands. He is succeeded by Ahadi. =Ni= Ni is a character who appears in The Lion King: Six New Adventures story Nala's Dare. He is a young lion who has left his pride to start his own and travels through the Pride Lands during Scar's reign and saves Nala from hyenas before leaving, after meeting the rest of the Pridelanders. =Kula= Kula is a character in The Lion King: Six New Adventures story Nala's Dare.

The name Joka translates as 'dragon' in the Swahili tongue. =Jelani= Jelani is Rafiki's lazy cousin in The Lion King: Six New Adventures story Follow the Leader. Despite being considered leader of his troop, he is unconcerned about the suffering of his subjects, as he is often too concerned about his own welfare to lead them to a new home. =Kwaheri= Kwaheri is Kopa's monkey friend in The Lion King: Six New Adventures stories Nala's Dare and How True, Zazu? He is social, talkative, and critical to his friends. He often flaunts his talents around Kopa to either spark a reaction or just be a show-off. =Boma= Boma is a cape buffalo who appears in The Lion King: Six New Adventures stories A Tale of Two Brothers and How True, Zazu?. His grandparents were killed during an attack by ants. He is the leader of the cape buffalo and he is aggressive, controlling, selfish, strong, and short-tempered. He is also somewhat reclusive and gruff, as he doesn't seem to understand that there is a balance between species and refuses to share the last remaining water-hole during a drought, which can affect the whole of the Pride Lands. It is due to him that Taka got his scar after which he renamed himself to Scar. If challenged or insulted he becomes very angry. However, he is mildly co-operative if not insulted or challenged. Taka tries to get Mufasa in trouble by telling him to talk with Boma to share the water-hole. Mufasa tries to reason with him to share the water-hole; however, he refuses. Scar then roars and tells him that he must obey or challenge Mufasa. He then chases after Mufasa who is rescued by Rafiki. Rafiki starts to grow tired while running but is picked up by Mufasa who then jumps across a ravine. Boma is unable to make the jumps and falls into it. Mufasa tells him that he doesn't have to fight but he keeps hurling thret while saying that the other buffaloes can still harm Taka. Taka is then attacked by three buffaloes during which he receives his scar.

Her talkative nature and nosy habits often make her a bit of an annoyance to the other animals; however, Ahadi puts her personality to good use in order to get a better grip on the doings of his kingdom. Zuzu is also known for being loyal and brave, as she was willing to help Rafiki even though she did not fully understand the danger Mufasa was in. It is revealed that she retired and gave Zazu her place as the king's majordomo. =King Joe= King Joe is a comic book character in The Lion King book A False Ancestor as he is a rogue stranger who lurks in the Pride Lands. He tricked Simba by saying that he was the great-great-great- grandfather of the current king, which is Mufasa. He later saves Simba from a river from nearly getting eaten by an alligator. After he saved Simba, he was never mentioned or seen again. He bears a similar mane and appearance to Nuka.

Biography Alexakis, the son of actor Giannis Alexakis, was born in Greece. He first came to France in 1961 to study journalism at the university in Lille and returned to Greece in 1964 to perform his military service. Because of the military junta he went into exile to Paris in 1968 and stayed. Today he spends most of his time in Paris but also travels regularly to Greece. Part of his experiences of his military service in the experimental Armed Forces Television (TED) was depicted in the cult Greek 1984 film Loafing and Camouflage, directed by Nikos Perakis, who served alongside Alexakis in TED. Alexakis' analogue is Pvt. Savidis, played by Giannis Chatziyannis. In his literary work he continues to draw from both Greek and French culture. In 1974 he published his first book Le Sandwich, written in French. The first book directly written in Greek was Talgo, published in 1981. By writing Talgo and later on La langue maternelle directly in Greek, he wanted to prove himself that he was still able to write in his mother tongue. He self-translated Talgo into French and since then he writes each book in French and Greek. In darkly humorous prose, he combines autobiography, history, fantasy, and suspense. In 2006, Les mots étrangers was translated by Alyson Waters and published under the title Foreign Words; this was the first of his novels to be translated into English. In 1995, he received the prestigious Prix Médicis for La langue maternelle. In 2007, he received the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for Ap. J.-C. Works in French * 1974: Le Sandwich.

Notable fights * \\"Marvelous\\" Marvin Hagler defeated John \\"The Beast\\" Mugabi in an 11th-round knockout on the debut broadcast of Showtime Championship Boxing on March 10, 1986. * Mike Tyson headlined multiple pay-per-view heavyweight fights, including: ** Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock and Mike Tyson vs. Donovan Ruddock II ** Mike Tyson vs. Peter McNeeley (He's Back), which marked his return after serving three years in prison. ** Frank Bruno vs. Mike Tyson II ** Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson ** Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield and Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II, the latter of which ended with Tyson disqualified for biting off part of Holyfield's right ear. ** Mike Tyson vs. Francois Botha ** Mike Tyson vs. Andrew Golota ** Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson (joint collaboration with HBO) * Nigel Benn defended his WBC Super-Middleweight title against Gerald McClellan in a dramatic fight that almost turned tragic by winning on a tenth-round technical knockout at London, England, on February 25, 1995. McClellan subsequently spent two months in a coma due to a massive brain injury and suffered blindness, impaired hearing, and inability to walk. Benn himself suffered from a broken nose and jaw, urinating blood and a shadow of a brain injury. * Diego Corrales defeated José Luis Castillo for the WBC lightweight title in a 10th-round TKO on May 7, 2005. The fight is almost universally regarded as the best fight of 2005. * A ShoBox match between Sechew Powell and Cornelius Bundrage on May 6, 2005, featured an extremely rare double knockdown. Both threw simultaneous rights to the chin, although the referee didn't score any single knockdowns, possibly due to the shock of the occurrence. * A ShoBox match between Allan Green and Jaidon Codrington, on November 4, 2005, was won via a knockout by Green 18 seconds into the bout. It was named the \\"Knockout of the Year\\" by The Ring. * The four fight series of Israel Vázquez and Rafael Márquez. Marquez won the first fight on March 3, 2007, after Vazquez couldn't continue after round 7. Vázquez would knock out Marquez in the sixth round of their second fight on August 4, 2007. This fight won Fight of the Year and Round of the Year (Round 3) honors for 2007 by The Ring. Their 3rd fight was considered to be the most exciting, which took place on March 1, 2008. Vazquez won the fight by split decision, after an incredible twelfth-round which saw Vázquez knock Márquez into the ropes, which prevented Marquez from hitting the canvas, resulting in a critical knockdown in the closing seconds of the fight. This fight was recognized as Fight of the Year for 2008 by Ring magazine as well. Marquez won their fourth fight by a third-round technical knockout. * Manny Pacquiao vs. Shane Mosley was aired on on May 7, 2011. * Floyd Mayweather Jr. signed with Showtime in 2013. His fights comprise: ** Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Robert Guerrero ** Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Canelo Álvarez ** Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Marcos Maidana and Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Marcos Maidana II ** Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao (joint collaboration with HBO) ** Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Andre Berto ** Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor * On June 25, 2016, sister network CBS broadcast a WBC welterweight championship fight between Shawn Porter and Keith Thurman, marking the first boxing event broadcast on CBS in primetime since 1978. The telecast, although part of the Premier Boxing Champions arrangement, was produced by Showtime and billed as Showtime Championship Boxing on CBS presented by Premier Boxing Champions. Thurman retained the WBC title via a unanimous decision. * On March 4, 2017, CBS aired Thurman's WBA/WBC welterweight unification bout against Danny García. Once again, the fight was broadcast in primetime as a Showtime presentation of Premier Boxing Champions. The fight, which Thurman won in a split decision, received a 2.2 Nielsen rating (a 22% gain over Thurman vs. Porter). * On April 29, 2017, Showtime broadcast the Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko fight from Wembley Stadium in London to unify the WBA (Super), IBF and IBO heavyweight titles. Uniquely, both Showtime and HBO held rights to the fight, but only Showtime held rights to broadcast it live. Commentators Brian Custer, currently serves as host of the program. The main broadcast team features Mauro Ranallo on blow-by-blow, Al Bernstein as chief color analyst and (when he is available) boxer Abner Mares as an analyst. Amir Khan, Austin Trout, and Daniel Jacobs have served as guest analysts. The third role was previously filled by Antonio Tarver, Ferdie Pacheco, Bobby Czyz, and Paulie Malignaggi among others. Veteran Jim Gray is chief reporter. Former top commentators include Steve Albert and Gus Johnson. The New Generation features Barry Tompkins on blow-by-blow, and Steve Farhood and Raul Marquez as the expert analysts.

The park covers 46.7 hectares and is located in the southwestern Fengtai District of Beijing. It is about 17 km from Tiananmen, the City center, and 40 km from the Capital International Airport. The park opened in 1993 and is estimated to receive 1.5 million visitors annually.http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/126712.htm thumbnail The park The entrance to the park is made up of a Gothic castle, Roman corridor, and granite relief sculptures. Immediately inside the gate is an Italian-style terrace garden with grand staircases, fountains, and sculptures inspired by originals from the European Renaissance. More lawns and gardens are scattered throughout the park. On these lawns are miniature models of around 100 of the world's most famous statues including the American Statue of Liberty, Copenhagen's Little Mermaid, Michelangelo's David, and the Venus de Milo. Once inside the gates, Beijing World Park consists of two main parts: the scenic portion and the shopping, dining, and entertainment area. =Scenic area= The scenic area of the park models itself after the naturalistic layout of the globe, representing the four major oceans, and focusing on five continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America. The park contains about a hundred (109) scaled-down replicas of famous landmarks from nearly 40 countries and regions around the world, including the Tower Bridge in London, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the Great Pyramids in Egypt. There is even a miniature Manhattan, complete with twin towers of the World Trade Center. Each landmark represents its country or region of origin and is situated in the park according to its location on the map. Close attention to detail was paid in modeling these landmarks after their originals. For example, detailed carvings and ornamentations are included. Even the materials used are modeled after their originals to create the most authentic look possible. For example, the replica of the Great Pyramids was constructed of 200,000 white marble bricks, each as large as a bar of soap. Red Square in Russia, is replicated by paving the smaller model in World Park with over 5 million red bricks smaller than mahjong tiles. =List of Some International Landmarks Featured in Beijing World Park= * Belgium's Atomium * Belgium's Manneken Pis *Egypt's Great Pyramids *Egypt's Pharos of Alexandria *Egypt's Great Sphinx *France's Eiffel Tower *France's Arc de Triomphe *France's Notre Dame Cathedral *India's Taj Mahal *Italy's Leaning Tower of Pisa *A Netherlands windmill *The United Kingdom's Big Ben Clocktower *The United Kingdom's Tower Bridge *The United States’ Manhattan with Empire State Building and World Trade Center *The Statue of Liberty Many of the locale- specific areas focused on the five continents also include live entertainment or some kind of an immersive cultural experience such as a dance performance or parade based on customs from their culture of origin. There is a special garden area in the scenic portion of the park that consists of China's Qingyingjing Park, Japan's Katsura Imperial Villa, and an American-style garden villa. This allows visitors to see global styles of gardening. To get around the park, visitors can travel the four “oceans” by speedboat tour. They can also take a monorail that circumvents the five continents to give tourists a glimpse of the whole “world”. Or they can take a tour of the park in battery-operated cars. =Shopping, dining, and entertainment area= The other portion of the park includes the shopping and dining area. This area is modeled after Euro-American architecture. The various establishments allow visitors to purchase souvenirs and sample cuisine from the countries and regions represented in the scenic portion of the park. This second part of the park also includes the entertainment area where grand spectacles and cinema features take place in large theatres to showcase global cultural costume, movement, and customs. Some of these cultural activities include the daily opening ceremonies, which consist of a parade of large-scale floats. There are also culture-specific folklore dances that take place indoors or in open-air arenas. These dances may be performed by Beijing World Park dancers, or they may be performed by troupes representing their local cultures. In 2005 the Park even hosted a Thai elephant that performed four times a day from May to October. The 2008 Summer Olympics During the 2008 Summer Olympics, it was selected as one of the three protest zones.

The seamount chain extends to the southeast on the Pacific Plate, beginning at the Aleutian Trench and terminating at Axial Seamount, located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.The seamount chain is spread over a vast length of approximately 1800 km. The location of the Cobb hotspot that gives rise to these seamounts is 46° N -130° W. The Pacific plate is moving to the northwest over the hotspot, causing the seamounts in the chain to decrease in age to the southeast. Axial is the youngest seamount and is located approximately 480 km west of Cannon Beach, Oregon. The most studied seamounts that make up this chain are Axial, Brown Bear, Cobb, and Patton seamounts. There are many other seamounts in this chain which have not been explored. Cobb-Eickelberg seamount chain extending all the way to Aleutian Trench  Formation  Seamounts are created at hot spots. These are isolated areas within tectonic plates where plumes of magma rise through the crust and erupt at the surface. This creates a chain of submarine volcanoes and seamounts. The Cobb hot spot is located at the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Plate is moving north-westward direction at a speed of ~5.5 cm per year. Periodic volcanic events have led to magma eruption onto the seafloor, forming seamounts. The last known volcanic activity was at Axial Seamount, which is currently directly overlying the hot spot. The total magmatic flux from the Cobb Hot Spot is about 0.3 cubic m/yr. Although the Cobb hotspot is currently located beneath the Juan de Fuca ridge, this has not always been the case. It went under the Juan de Fuca Ridge when the Pacific plate started moving northwest and eventually the boundary came right on top of the hot spot. Currently the Axial seamount is the only active seamount. The most recent eruption took place in April–May 2015.  Seamounts  1\\\\. Axial Seamount (46° 03′ 36″ N, 130° 00′ 0″ W) The most recent seamount Axial Seamount is the youngest seamount in the Cobb Eickelberg Seamount chain. Since this is the most active of all the Cobb-Eickelberg Seamounts, it is studied the most: to help understand the dynamics of seamounts, volcanic activity, earthquakes, biodiversity, geology and chemistry. The Axial Volcano is about 700 meters higher than the Juan de Fuca Ridge and about 1000 meters higher than the front of the flanking basins on either side. The Axial Volcano plateaus on top, and has a relatively smooth relief, with a rectangular shape of size 3 km x 8 km. 42% of the lava surrounding the volcano ranges from ropy, whorly, or lineated pāhoehoe to jumbled chaotic form. The remaining area is mostly pillow basalt. Colonial protozoans, bacterial mats, pogonophorans, metazoans, polychaetes, bivalves, tubeworms, copepods and many other organisms are found in the region where there are hydrothermal vents present in the caldera. This helps with the study of varying biodiversity at great depths. Axial seamount is the only active seamount in the chain, because it is on top of the Cobb hot spot. All the other seamounts in this chain are inactive because their source of magma, the Cobb hot spot, has moved out from underneath them. 2\\\\. Brown Bear Volcano (46° 02′ 24″ N, 130° 27′ 36″ W) With an age of 0.5-1.5 million years, Brown Bear Seamount is the second youngest seamount in the Cobb-Eickelberg chain. It is northwest of Axial Seamount and connected by a small ridge. Due to its separation from the Juan de Fuca ridge, spreading has very little effect on Brown Bear, so it is not as geologically complex and is not studied in detail. It has a volcanic cone of width 5 km and rises approximately 1000 meters from the ocean floor. The Brown Bear Seamount summit is at a depth of 1400 meters. Geographically, the Brown Bear Seamount is separated into two areas, Northwestern and Southeastern, with distinct morphological features. This is thought to be caused by the influence of the mid ocean ridge extensional stress regime. The morphology of the western portion also suggests that it was formed before the hot spot interacted with the Juan de Fuca ridge. The northwestern section of Brown Bear is dominated by a large (5 km diameter) rounded volcanic cone structure. The southern portion extends south of 46.1 degrees North Latitude, and consists of relatively small (1–2 km diameter) volcanic cones. 3\\\\. Cobb Seamount (46° 44′ 0″ N, 130° 47′ 0″ W) The Cobb Seamount rises from a 2750 m basin to within 37 meters of the ocean surface. It is located just 100 km to the northwest of the hot spot. This seamount is at least 3.3 million years old. The Cobb seamount has been extensively studied for its geological features. Cobb seamount was once an island that was 914 meters above sea level which due to erosion became a seamount. Samples collected from this location were used in studies that determined the age and geological composition of the rocks. The Cobb Seamount is all basalt and contains phenocrysts of plagioclase and clinopyroxene; the intergranular/interstitial matrix was found to have iron and titanium oxides. Video and photographs collected in 2012 from Cobb Seamount have shown a wide variety of biodiversity at the location. 17 benthic taxa were observed through pictures collected from the ROV dives. Most common species included sea cucumbers, squat lobsters, thornyheads, and corals. 4\\\\. Patton Seamount (54° 34′ 48″ N, 150° 26′ 24″ W) 3-D bathymetric map of Patton Seamount, a Gulf of Alaska seamount, with two smaller seamounts in the foreground. Deep areas are blue, and shallow areas are red. Patton Seamount is about 33 million years old. Although there is not much information about its geology, the biology at the Patton Seamount is very well studied. The seamount's summit is 183 meters below the ocean surface, and its height from the seafloor is 3048 meters. In July 1999, DSV Alvin was used to explore the biodiversity at the Patton Seamount. The shallow water community mostly consisted of rockfish, flatfish, sea stars and attached suspension feeders. The community at mid-depths consisted of attached suspension feeding organisms like corals, sponges, crinoids, sea anemones and sea cucumbers. The common fish species were the sablefish and the giant grenadier. The deep water community consisted of fewer attached suspension feeders and more highly mobile species like Pacific grenadier, popeye grenadier, Pacific flatnose and large mobile crabs.  Volcanic activity in the past and eruptions Currently, the only active seamount is Axial Seamount, located directly overtop the hotspot at Juan de Fuca Ridge. The most recent eruption was in April–May 2015, with a prior eruption in 2011. Another eruption was detected seismically in January 1998. Lava erupted from a 9 km long fissure, and the caldera subsided by 3 meters during the eruption. In 1983, hydrothermal venting was discovered. Foraminiferan fossil studies have suggested that Cobb Seamount was a pre-late Eocene volcano. Thus, it was likely volcanically active approximately 40 million years ago, and remained volcanically active until about 3.3 million years ago when the Cobb seamount was formed. Ar40-Ar39 dating of deep basalt from the Patton seamount shows it to be 33 million years old, which coincides with the time when the seamount was above the Cobb hot spot. However, there are samples collected from shallower depths of basalt which are younger, suggesting that even after the hotspot volcanism ceases, non-hotspot volcanism can sometimes take place.

It claims to be the oldest distillery brand in the world.. Its brand portfolio consists of Bols, Galliano, Vaccari, Pisang Ambon, Gold Strike and a large group of Dutch genevers and liqueurs. It produces about 3 million cases a year, with yearly revenues exceeding 95 million euros. History =Beginnings= In 1575 the Bols family opened their distillery t Lootsje (the little shed) in Amsterdam. The distillery was located outside the city walls on the post road to Haarlem, situated next to a stream. By 1612 the city's walls had expanded to encompass the distillery, and the stream was dug out into a canal called the Rozengracht because of rose nurseries in the area. Around the same time, a new stone building was constructed to house the distillery. The first official mention is in 1640 in Amsterdam town papers, where Pieter Jacobszoon Bols is documented as operator of t Lootsje on the Rozengracht. Lucas Bols was born in 1652. His era corresponded with the Dutch golden age, when the Netherlands were a colonial power, and led the world in international commerce. The Dutch East India Company, of which Lucas was a major shareholder, brought exotic herbs, spices and fruits back to Amsterdam, and these were used to create new liqueurs and genevers. During the 18th century, the Bols family became a very prosperous dynasty, but found itself becoming more and more detached from the day to day operation of the distillery. This lack of family leadership, along with the Continental Blockade of Napoleon, severely weakened the company, and when last male heir, Herman Bols, died in 1813, the company was offered for sale. =Van 't Wout era= Napoleon's defeat in 1815 sparked buying interest in the company, and Rotterdam financier Gabriël Theodorus van 't Wout acquired the firm with the condition that the company permanently retain the Bols name. New ownership revitalized the company. A price list from 1820 shows over 300 varieties of liqueurs, bitters, elixirs and gins; it is possible that some of these were never produced, and were merely disinformation aimed at competitors. Van 't Wout succeeded in bringing the distillery back to profitability, but by 1822 a falling out with partner Coenraad Adriaan Temminck caused him to abandon his efforts with the company. In 1842 Van 't Wout wrote a manuscript entitled Distillateurs- en Liqueurbereiders Handboek door een oude patroon van 't Lootsje (English: Distillers and Liqueur makers Handbook by an old patron of \\"The Little Shed\\"), which is now in the Bols archives. =Moltzer family era= In 1868 the firm was again sold, this time to the Moltzer family who greatly expanded the company. In 1889, the Rozengracht canal was filled in order to provide a new major thoroughfare for Amsterdam. The old site was abandoned and a modern steam powered distillery was built in nearby Nieuw Vennep. Other distilleries were built in Scheveningen and in Emmerich, just over the Dutch border in Germany. In 1892, the company was reorganized into an LLC. Former Dutch colonial possessions proved natural markets for the group's products, and a rapid international expansion followed. By the turn of the century, Bols was aggressively marketing its lines, and nearly all European dynasties had appointed them Royal Warrants. In 1873 Bols won a Fortschritts-Medaille at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien and one year later became purveyor to the imperial court in Vienna. Other courts followed such as several kings and queens of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, Monaco, and later in more modern times the courts of Ethiopia and Nepal. After World War I, distilleries were started in France (1921), Poland (1922), Switzerland (1929), Canada (1932), South Africa (1933), Belgium (1934), Argentina (1935), Spain (1935) and the United States (1947). Bols also grew through takeover, including the firms of Hoppe and Wynand Fockink, its largest competitor since 1679. In 1954, the last of the Moltzer family left the board of directors, and Bols Distilleries became a publicly traded company. =Diversification= Bols continued to expand its reach over the next few decades until it participated in almost every geographic market in the world. Management was quick to realize, however, that societal trends away from alcohol consumption, particularly spirits, threatened the company. Genever was still a large component of Bol's revenues, and this was a particularly difficult market to grow outside of its native Netherlands, as global drinkers tended to prefer the British \\"dry\\" style of gin. A strategy of diversification through acquisition was adopted, and in 1977 Italian brands Cynar and Biancosarti, both aperitifs, were added, and in 1983 the company added its first non- alcoholic beverages with the acquisition of Terme di Crodo, makers of still and sparkling mineral waters, non-alcoholic bitters, and sodas, including Crodino, and various other fruit flavored beverages. (In a later divestiture, these brands became part of Campari Group). Through the 1980s, Bols continued to expand its range of non-alcoholic beverages with particular emphasis on the Italian and Swiss markets. Already a leading producer of alcoholic beverages in its home country, Bols became the dominant producer of genever with its 1986 acquisition of Rotterdam based . In addition, this allowed Bols to vertically integrate itself, as Henkes had a network of retail liquor stores in the Netherlands. In 1988, Bols acquired Strothmann Brennereien GmbH & Co AG., instantly giving it the largest market share in the Korn Schnapps market, along with distribution channels and production facilities in Germany. In 1989, Bols formed a joint venture with Gedistilleerd en Wijngroep Nederland (GWN), the wine and distilled beverages unit of Heineken, forming Bols Benelux B.V. The venture attained a near 50% market share in the Dutch liquor business, due in part to GWN's earlier acquisition of Bokma, another leading genever brand. The joint venture expanded into the rapidly growing wine segment, purchasing 85 percent of Consortium Vinicole de Bordeaux (CVBG), formerly part of Douwe Egberts. Other smaller French wine houses were quickly added to the portfolio. The company also boosted its operations in Italy in 1990, buying up Ottavio Riccadonna, adding that company's Spumante and Ricadonna brands. =Wessanen merger= By 1993, competition and consolidation in the industry had become cutthroat. Heineken decided to retrench to its beer business, and sold off its stake in the joint venture for 58.6 million guilders. Dutch foods giant Royal Wessanen and Bols saw a natural fit for horizontal integration, and a merger was completed into a new company: Bols Wessanen. From the beginning, integrating the two lines of business was difficult, and so led to profit pressures. The 1995 annual stockholders meeting was contentious and the company decided to focus its growth efforts toward the food sector. In 1997, the company moved to a new headquarters and production facility in Zoetermeer. By 1999, it was obvious that the partnership wasn't working. The Bols side of the business was being neglected, and management wanted to unlock its potential for growth and profitability. CVC Capital Partners, a private equity firm, agreed, and a management buyout by the executive board (R.van Ogtrop, M. Emondts and T. Coenen ) was engineered forming Bols Royal Distilleries. Immediately thereafter, Bols acquired a number of brands from British drinks conglomerate Diageo. =Acquired by Remy Cointreau= Almost immediately after the buyout, it became clear that Bols did not have the scale to effectively compete in the rapidly consolidating drinks industry. CVC Capital had an existing relationship with Remy Cointreau, so it seemed natural to combine the two companies. In August 2000 an agreement was reached, and Remy paid CVC €510 million for Bols, which retained a 9% equity stake in the enlarged group. The merger was perceived as greatly helping both companies, allowing Remy to diversify into products requiring no expensive aging stock, an Eastern European distribution network, and access to Bol's management skills, while giving Bols access to Remy's joint venture worldwide distribution alliance, Maxxium. The synergies of the combined company were immediately felt. Remy reported a string of strong earnings and profit growth, until a weakening dollar and a temporary drop in sales of Bols Vodka in Poland due to taxation and counterfeiting issues hurt 2003 results. Results in 2004 remained weak, but strong growth was noted of the vodka brand throughout Eastern Europe, and Maxxium committed considerable resources to modernizing the Bols image, including new packaging and refocusing on a youth driven market. Bols was awarded \\"Best Brand Re-Launch\\" by the trade publication Drinks International Magazine. In 2005, Remy struck a complex deal with Central European Distribution Corporation (CEDC), wherein CEDC took ownership of the Bols production facilities in Poland and licensed various trademarks for use in Poland and Russia in exchange for a 9% equity stake. The deal gave each company access to the other's distribution networks. Remy also received a seat on CEDC's board of directors. CEDC would later buy Bol's Hungarian subsidiary and trademarks. =Management buyout= In 2005, Remy decided to focus on its premium brands, and on 8 December, it announced it would sell the Bols brand to concentrate on its core drinks. On 16 March 2006, Remy announced the sale of Bols to European investment fund ABN AMRO Capital (75%), together with a management group led by Mr. Huub van Doorne (25%). Mr. Van Doorne was a member of Rémy Cointreau's Management Board, and led the team that revitalized the Bols brand under Remy's aegis. Mezzanine capital was provided by GSC Group. The new company is named Lucas Bols, B.V. and is headquartered in Amsterdam. Its assets include the production facilities in the Netherlands, along with the brands, Bols, Galliano, Vaccari Sambuca, Pisang Ambon and Damrak Gin, plus leading Dutch Origin spirit brands such as Bokma and Hartevelt genevers and Coebergh. Distribution will still be mostly done by Maxxium, although the United States will be handled by new partner William Grant & Son, USA., a wholly owned subsidiary of William Grant & Sons. Marketing Bols has greatly increased its marketing presence under the leadership of Mr. Van Doorne, first as part of Remy Cointreau, and now as an independent company. The vision is to drive the Bols brands growth and profitability through the \\"on-trade\\" market, meaning in bars and restaurants. To do this, Bols is positioning itself as a leader to bar owners and their staff in support, innovation and new product development. Bols wants its ingredients to be thought of as an irreplaceable component in mixology and cocktail culture, as it capitalizes on evolving trends in the use of liqueurs. To this end, Bols actively courts bar owners, bartenders and consumers through a marketing strategy of trade associations, campaigns, sponsorships, and bartending academies and competitions. =Museum= Bols has constructed a \\"brand experience\\" in Amsterdam, which includes not only a traditional museum of the history of the brand, its manufacturing methods and ingredients, but also various interactive exhibits which involve the visitor and engage the senses. Visitors can even practice flair bartending. =Bartending Academy= Bartenders themselves are a top priority for Bols and the Bols bartending academy offers accredited courses in bartending, flair bartending, mixology (the method behind bartending) and hospitality management. Products Bols produces a number of different brands. It is common in the drinks industry for companies to buy and sell brands among themselves, as business decisions are made about what market space a particular company wants to occupy. With constant consolidation and divestiture in the industry, a company's brand portfolio is usually in a state of flux. Bols owns brands that it has historically produced, as well as ones acquired in various stages of its evolution, either directly or through joint ventures or other partnerships. =Liqueurs= Bols branded Bols has long produced liqueurs it marketed under its own eponymous brand, going back in time to the very first products it made. Currently, it produces a line of 38 different flavors, sold in the new teardrop shaped bottle. These include: * Advocaat, an egg based liqueur * Amaretto, an almond flavored liqueur made from apricot pits * Apricot brandy * Bitter orange, a lighter orange colored liqueur made from Spanish oranges and bitter herbs * Blueberry, liqueur * Butterscotch schnapps * Blue Curaçao, a deep blue, orange flavored liqueur made from a variety of orange types and herbs. This is Bols' signature product, and is commonly referred to as \\"Bols Blue.\\" * Cherry brandy. The cherry pit is also used, imparting a slight almond flavor. * Coconut liqueur, with rum flavoring * Coffee liqueur * Crème de Banane, with vanilla, almond, herbs, and spices * Crème de cacao brown * Crème de cacao white * Crème de Cassis, a blackcurrant flavored liqueur * Dry Orange Curaçao, a dark orange colored liqueur made from orange peels and bitter herbs * Grune Bananes liqueur * Green Tea liqueur * Kirsch liqueur, a clear Schwarzwalder cherry brandy with added sweetener * Kiwi liqueur * Lychee liqueur * Maraschino, a clear Marasca cherry flavored liqueur Bols makes with Kirsch and a selection of herbs * Mango liqueur * Melon liqueur * Parfait Amour, a purple colored Rose petal and orange liqueur, with a hint of vanilla. Another of Bols' centuries old recipes. * Passion fruit liqueur * Peach liqueur * Peppermint Green and White. Bols' Crème de Menthe products. * Pomegranate liqueur * Prinzenkirsch, a sweeter, juicier Kirsch * Raspberry (Framboise) liqueur * Red Orange liqueur. A bright red, sweet blend of citrus and tropical fruit such as passion fruit and peach. * Sloe Gin liqueur * Strawberry (fraise) liqueur * Triple sec Curaçao, a clear, orange liqueur * Triple Sec & Lime liqueur. A fusion of lime extract and Triple Sec. * Vanilla liqueur * Watermelon liqueur Also documented elsewhere, but not officially mentioned by Bols are blackberry liqueur and sour apple liqueur. Note: Although fruit brandies are not strictly liqueurs, Bols classifies theirs as such, perhaps due to added sweeteners. Pisang Ambon Pisang Ambon is a banana and tropical fruit flavored liqueur. Galliano Galliano is a complex anise, vanilla and herbal liqueur first produced by Vaccari. It is also confusingly the brand name for a line of other liqueurs from Vaccari, most or all of which are no longer produced. The line included an amaretto, a black sambuca, a white sambuca, and a white peach liqueur. Vaccari Sambuca Sambuca is a traditional Italian liqueur flavored with star anise. Bootz Bootz is a Dutch-only brand which includes a wide range of liqueurs and spirits. One of these is the no longer existing liqueur Tip van Bootz. Coebergh Coebergh is a Dutch only brand which is the number one liqueur and the biggest drinks brand for women in the Netherlands. It is produced in four styles: Coebergh Classic has a blackcurrant/blackberry flavor, Coebergh Red has a cranberry flavor, Coebergh Cherry and Coebergh raspberry. In the Netherlands it is informally referred to as 'bessen',(literally meaning berries), often in a mix with Sprite or 7-up. Evita A Dutch-only coffee flavored liqueur. Goldstrike A Dutch-only cinnamon schnapps, similar to Goldschläger. A less alcoholic version with silver flakes called Silverstrike also exists. Kontiki Kontiki is a gin-based liqueur flavored with lemon and grapefruit. Zwarte Kip Zwarte Kip is an advocaat, a thick and creamy eggnog flavored liqueur. =Liquors= Bols branded Bols has a line of internationally shipped vodka, flavored vodkas, gin, and genever. As noted above, in Eastern Europe, the Bols brand is produced and marketed by another entity, CEDC. Damrak Gin Damrak is a luxury, international-style gin. It has been well reviewed in independent drinks competitions. Damrak was Amsterdam's first harbor, and the name pays tribute to the original genever trade. Bokma Bokma is a Dutch-only brand of genevers, Lemon Genever, and Lemon Brandy. Claeryn Claeryn is a Dutch-only brand of jonge genever. Claeryn was also involved in an important legal case involving trademarks. The Benelux Court of Justice held that a similarly named liquid detergent infringed due to the concept of detriment of repute.Claeryn / Klarein, Case A 74/1, judgment of 1 March 1975, Jurisprudence of the Benelux Court of Justice 1975, p. 472. Els La Vera :nl:Els La Vera is a traditional bitters from the Limburg region, popular in the south of the Netherlands. Hartevelt Hartevelt is another complete line of genevers and lemon brandy. Hoppe Yet another jonge genever. Parade An old Dutch value brand used in off-trade (home) mixing.  Statistics  In 2016 to 2019, there was a 5.6% loss in Lucas Bols, leading to less profitability of shareholders.

It is set primarily in London during the reign of King Henry VIII. It is Sutcliff's third book, and is acknowledged by her as being 'a little too cozy and a little too sweet,' being part of what she refers to as her 'apprenticeship phase of writing.Historical Novel Society: Rosemary Sutcliff' and will likely read as more of an outright children's novel than most of her later works. Though unrelated to the Eagle of the Ninth series connected by the Dolphin Signet ring, this novel features Sutcliff's first use of Dolphin imagery in her storytelling. Plot summary The story revolves around a 10-year-old girl named Tamsyn, who has been orphaned and is being raised by her uncle, a shipowner in Bideford. She is brought to live in London by another uncle, who works as a swordsmith, or armourer, being the owner of the house after which the novel is titled. Tamsyn is a dark- complected girl, contrasting with the entirely red headed family which has taken her in; showing Sutcliff's reoccurring themes of outsiders, belonging, red heads, and light vs. dark. She is homesick for her West Country life, but slowly adapts to London city life and being part of a larger family. Through the novel she witnesses Morris dancers on May Day; visits the market in Cheapside, the Billingsgate Fish Market, and the Royal Dockyard in Deptford. She watches King Henry VIII and his current queen Anne Boleyn proceed up the Thames in his royal barge, transiting from his palace in Greenwich to his palace in Westminster. The mother of the house tells them the tale of Tam Lin on Halloween, which parallels the theme of a girl who struggles to pursue her dreams. She watches tall ships at the docks, consistently showing a strong interest in sailing, which she shares with one of the Armourer's sons, Piers. Both Piers and Tamsyn dream of sailing away and exploring the word, adventuring with the backdrop of the Age of Exploration. Piers is restrained by being bound as an apprentice to his father, while Tamsyn is restrained by being a girl. The oldest son, who had been thought drowned, returns to the family on Christmas Eve while they are home singing Christmas Carols. This frees Piers from his obligation, so he is welcomed to sail with the ship- owning uncle in the coming spring. Tamsyn is overjoyed, as he has promised to bring her along when he is older and becomes master of a ship.

Spanish colonial control Different guerrilla-style movements have appeared in Venezuela, Nigeria, Fiji, and Colombia ever since the Spanish conquest of the Americas. The indigenous peoples were the first to use irregular warfare against the Spanish invaders and colonial administrations. By the early 19th century, groups of Creoles and mestizos, segregated from the European-born Spaniards, participated in separatist movements opposed to local authorities and later the Spanish monarchy itself. They established \\"patriotic armies\\" (Ejércitos patriotas) which included both regular and irregular forces. Colombian Civil War of 1860-1862 The Colombian Civil War of May 8, 1860 to November 1862 was an internal conflict between the newly formed conservative Grenadine Confederation and a more liberal rebel force from the newly succeeded region of Cauca, composed of dissatisfied politicians commanded by General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, its former president. The Grenadine Confederation, created a few years earlier in 1858 by Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, was defeated in the capital Bogotá, with Mosquera deposing the newly elected president Bartolomé Calvo on July 18, 1861. Forming a provisional government, with himself as president, Mosquera continued to pursue the conservative forces until their final defeat in 1862. The resulting formation of the new United States of Colombia would have significant cultural and economic consequences for Colombia.The Federalists Country Studies article retrieved on April 16, 2007 Thousand days civil war The Thousand Days War (1899–1902) (Spanish: Guerra de los Mil Días), was a civil armed conflict in the newly created Republic of Colombia, (including its then province of Panama) between the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party and its radical factions. In 1899 the ruling conservatives were accused of maintaining power through fraudulent elections. The situation was worsened by an economic crisis caused by falling coffee prices in the international market, which mainly affected the opposition Liberal Party, which had lost power. La Violencia La Violencia (, The Violence) is a period of civil conflict in the Colombian countryside between supporters of the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Conservative Party, a conflict which took place roughly from 1948 to 1958 (sources vary on the exact dates). Azcarate quotes a figure of 300,000 dead between 1948-1959 *Political violence is not new to that South American nation of 38 million people. In the past 100 years, more than 500,000 Colombians have died in it. From the \\"War of the Thousand Days,\\" a civil war at the turn of the 20th century that left 100,000 dead, to a partisan clash between 1948 and 1966 that claimed nearly 300,000...On April 9, 1948, Gaitán was assassinated outside his law offices in downtown Bogotá. The assassination marked the start of a decade of bloodshed, called La Violencia (the violence), which took the lives of an estimated 180,000 Colombians before it subsided in 1958. Some historians disagree about the dates: some argue it started in 1946 when the Conservatives came back into government, because at a local level the leadership of the police forces and town councils changed hands, encouraging Conservative peasants to seize land from Liberal peasants and setting off a new wave of bi-partisan violence in the countryside. But traditionally, most historians argue that La Violencia began with the death of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. The end of La Violencia is disputed, but some say it ended with the creation of a new party that took over the shared control of the government. This party was a collaboration between the Liberal and Conservative party leaders and was called the National Front. The main reason they started this collaboration was because they wanted to end the period of violence that Colombia was going through. One of the conditions to the collaboration was that all other political actors were excluded from the political process. In 1974 the party came to an official end, but still had a say in the government until the 1980s. Colombian armed conflict (1960s - present) In the period from 1960 until the 1990s we can distinguish two generations of guerrilla struggles. The first generation is from 1964 until the mid 70s. The main guerrilla movements in this generation are the FARC, ELN and the EPL. The second generation is from 1974 until 1982. In this period there is also another guerrilla movement, the M-19. The period afterwards is called the armed peace period and is from 1982 until 1985. First generation (1964- mid 70s) One of the first guerrilla movements was the FARC, established in 1966 as a reaction to the National Front. The FARC was a communist movement that grew out of a rural defense group, who believed they could bring social justice through communism. Their first leader was Manuel Sureshot Marulanda. Another guerrilla movement, the ELN, was established in the early 60s by students who got their ideas from the revolution in Cuba. Second generation (1974-1982) In the 1970s multiple guerrilla movements emerged in Colombia. One of these groups was the 19th of April Movement, the M-19. This group established in reaction to the claimed fraud that happened during the presidential elections in 1970. Armed peace period (1982-1985) In 1984 the former president of Colombia Belisario Betancur signed a ceasefire with the FARC and M-19. This ceasefire only lasted for a year, even though the armed forces of the Colombian government tried to make it last longer. The FARC and M-19 ended the ceasefire in a different way, on different dates. FARC getting stronger (1986-1999) The FARC grew bigger and stronger and eventually became the biggest and best organised guerrilla movement of Latin-America. In 1986 there were almost 10,000 combatants that fought at almost 30 different locations. More than a decade later, in 1999, the FARC grew to almost 15,000 combatants at nearly 60 fronts. The FARC was active across Colombia, in nearly 40 percent of all the municipalities. The conflict didn't stay in Colombia itself, but became a cross-border conflict. One of the biggest 'enemies' outside of Colombia for the FARC were the United States. Latest peace negotiations (2012–present) In 2012 the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, and the leader of the FARC, Timoleon Jimenez (also called Timochencko) started peace negotiations in Havana. On the 26th of September 2016, the first peace agreement between the two groups was signed at a big ceremony in Cartagena. For the agreement to get ratified they held a referendum in October 2016. Even though they thought that they would win with 66 percent, the referendum was lost with 50,2 percent against and 49,8 percent pro the peace agreement. The negotiations continued and in November they signed the second agreement, ending a conflict that was going on for more than 52 years. A conflict that killed over a 220,000 people and displaced more than 7 million.

H. Francke and edited by F. W. Thomas, (1926), pages 115-116. traditionally transliterated as Demchok,: '... the village of Demchok marked the border between Tibet and Ladakh for a long time. Abdul Wahid Radhu, a former representative of the Lopchak caravan,[14] described Demchok in his travel account as “the first location on the Tibetan side of the border”.' is a village in the disputed Demchok sector that is administered as part of the Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region by China.  Geography  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) passes along the northwest side of the village, following the Charding Nullah upstream from the nearby Indus River. The Indian-administered village of Demchok, Ladakh is roughly 600m away, across the stream. The Indian-claimed border extends southeast of Demchok, while the Chinese-claimed border extends northwest of Demchok. Dêmqog is located on the west bank of the Indus, roughly 30 km from Zhaxigang. It has an average altitude of over 4,000m. History = 17th to 19th centuries = The village of Demchok was mentioned in the Chronicles of Ladakh as the boundary point between Tibet and Ladakh demarcated in the 1684 Treaty of Tingmosgang. When Henry Strachey visited the area in 1847, he described Demchok as a single hamlet with settlements on both the sides of the Lhari stream and the stream as the prevailing border between Ladakh and Tibet. A governor (wazir-e- wazarat) of Ladakh visited the area in 1904–05 and found the Tibetan Demchok village housing 8 to 9 huts of zamindars (landholders) while the Ladakhi Demchok village had only two zamindars.: \\"I visited Demchok on the boundary with Lhasa. ... A nullah falls into the Indus river from the south-west and it (Demchok) is situated at the junction of the river. Across is the boundary of Lhasa, where there are 8 to 9 huts of the Lhasa zamindars. On this side there are only two zamindars.\\" When Sven Hedin visited the area in the November 1907, he described Demchok as four or five huts lying on the southeastern bank of the Lhari stream in Tibet, with the Ladakhi side of the Lhari stream only containing the pyramidal Lhari peak and the ruins of two or three houses. 'Hedin described the place as follows: \\"Rolled stones play an important part in the country which we have now reached. The whole of Demchok, the last village on the Tibetan side, is built of them. It consists, however, of only four or five huts with brushwood roofs.\\"': \\"A short distance N. W. of Demchok, the road passes a partly frozen brook [Lhari stream] coming from Demchok-pu, a tributary valley from the left. ... At the left side [Ladakhi side] of the mouth of this little valley, are the ruins of two or three houses, which were said to have belonged to Hemi-gompa. A pyramidal peak at the same.. side of the valley is called La-ri and said to be sacred. The valley, Demchok-pu, itself is regarded as the boundary between Tibet and Ladak.\\" =Chinese administration= By 1984, there were only three households living in Dêmqog. In 1984, committees from the Tibet Autonomous Region, Ngari Prefecture, and Gar County governments selected 24 people from 5 households to move from Jiamu Village, over 100 km away in Shiquanhe, to move to Dêmqog, although 3 of those residents returned to Jiamu Village the following year because they found the climate unsuitable. In 1990, Dêmqog was administratively established as a village. In that year, 9 households were selected from Jiamu Village to move to Shoubian in Dêmqog, and there were a total of 15 households in Dêmqog divided into two working groups. From 2011 to 2018, the Gar County government invested more than on facilities and rebuilding the local residences. The construction of the two-storey single-family villas, which replaced the previous low-rise adobe houses, was completed in 2018. In 2017, Dêmqog was named a by the Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization. Demographics In 2019, there were 171 people in 51 households living in Dêmqog, of whom 41 were members of the Chinese Communist Party. In 2015, the per capita income was . Economy The local economy of Dêmqog is largely based on cattle and sheep grazing. The northeast corner of the village contained a small border trade market largely containing Indian handicrafts and Chinese daily necessities that operated from 1999 to 2008. Residents of Dêmqog receive government subsidies for living in a border region and for living in grasslands. In 2012, travel writer Romesh Bhattacharji stated that China expected to set up a trading village in Dêmqog, but India never renewed trade after the war. He stated that the southern Dêmqog village has only commercial buildings whereas the northern village has security-related buildings. Education In 2015, the primary and secondary school enrollment rate for school-age children was 98%. Infrastructure Before 2011, Dêmqog lacked electricity and running water. By 2017, the village was completely electrified by two photovoltaic power stations and had water pumped from two newly-drilled wells. The village also has full cellular network coverage, contains 2 public toilets, and has a landfill.

He was also known as .  Biography  Zusho was born in the Kagoshima castle town in 1776, the son of Satsuma samurai Kawasaki Motoaki. At age 12 he was adopted by Zusho Kiyonobu; at 22, he was sent to Edo as a tea assistant to the retired lord of Satsuma, Shimazu Shigehide. Shigehide recognized Zusho's talents, and gave him further responsibilities. He was later employed by the Satsuma lord, Shimazu Narioki, serving Narioki as messenger and city magistrate; he was also involved with Satsuma's illicit trade with the Qing Empire and the west, via the Ryukyu Islands. In 1832, he was elevated to karō status; six years later he formally received the rank of karō. As karō, he was involved with finance, agriculture, and military reform. At the time, the Satsuma domain's debt totaled over 5 million ryō. In order to address this problem, he began a program of administrative and agricultural reforms, and levied a no-interest loan on the merchants of Satsuma, to be repaid over the course of 250 years. This means that the domain had promised to repay the loan from then until 2085; however, with the breakup of the domains in 1872, the Meiji government declared this debt to be invalid. Zusho also increased the level of illicit trade taking place with the Qing Empire, via the Ryukyu Islands. Zusho also put a monopoly system in place on the local sugar trade, and increased trade and production levels; by 1840, this had produced a 2,500,000 ryō surplus for the Satsuma domain. However, Zusho soon became embroiled in the dispute over who would succeed Narioki: his eldest son Nariakira, or Nariakira's half-brother Hisamitsu. Narioki and Zusho's preference was Hisamitsu; Zusho was also worried that Nariakira, interested in western things as Shigehide had been, would ruin the domain's finances, which he had worked so hard to restore. Nariakira, aiming to remove his political enemies Narioki and Zusho from power, secretly revealed the illicit Ryukyu trade to the rōjū, Abe Masahiro. In 1848, while Zusho was in Edo, he was summoned by Abe for an inquiry into the secret trade. Soon after this trade was revealed, Zusho died suddenly in one of the Satsuma residences in Edo; he is believed to have either committed seppuku or taken poison, in order to protect Narioki from further endangerment. His age at death was 73. After Zusho's death, his family had its residence, income, and status confiscated by Nariakira. Zusho's grave is located at Fukushōji temple, in modern Kagoshima City.  Legacy  In the Bakumatsu period, the Satsuma domain was unlike most other domains in Japan, as it possessed large numbers of steam-driven warships and cannons. This is almost miraculous, given that only one generation previously, the domain was over 5 million ryō in debt; Satsuma's annual income barely exceeded 120,000 to 140,000 ryō. It is thanks to Zusho Hirosato's budget-balancing efforts that this level of military buildup was possible for Satsuma. A statue of Zusho now stands at Tenpōzan Park in Kagoshima City.

At the time of the British Census of 1881, the relative frequency of the surname Barnes was highest in Dorset (2.9 times the British average), followed by Wiltshire, Cumberland, Hampshire, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire, Huntingdonshire, Lancashire and Sussex. There are multiple theories of the origin of the surname; it is variously suggested to be of Anglo-Saxon, Norse, or Irish provenance. According to one etymology, the name is derived from Old English beorn (warrior), which is in turn of Old Norse origin.

It owned by the Sumter County and Airport Authority.Federal Aviation Administration airport information for Jimmy Carter Regional Airport Although most U.S. airports use the same three- letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, Souther Field is assigned ACJ by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA.Great Circle Mapper: KACJ - Americus, Georgia (Souther Field) Facilities and aircraft Jimmy Carter Regional Airport covers an area of which contains two asphalt paved runways: 5/23 measuring and 9/27 measuring . As of 2011, there are 28 aircraft based at this airport. These aircraft include 26 single-engine, and 2 multi-engine aircraft. For the 12-month period ending June 7, 2006, the airport had 5,600 aircraft operations, an average of 15 per day: 98% general aviation and 2% military. History Souther FieldSouther Field was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917.William R. Evinger: Directory of Military Bases in the U.S., Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147. Its history begins in 1918, when on 19 January, the War Department leased north of the center of Americus, Georgia from Sumter County for a primary training airfield and an aviation supply depot. The Air Service named the facility Souther Field in honor of Major Henry Souther who served as consulting engineer on many of the World War I aviation projects. Major Souther had been killed earlier in the line of duty at Fort Monroe, Virginia. When completed, the base consisted of warehouses, accommodations for 2,000 officers and men, 15 wooden hangars, and a hospital plus other structures. After the end of the conflict, the War Department deactivated the field and sold its surplus airplanes to the public. One of the surplus aircraft buyers was none other than Charles Lindbergh. In May 1923, Lindbergh paid $500 for a Jenny with a brand-new OX-5 engine, a new paint job, and an extra 20 gal. gasoline tank. He had over 100 Jenny airframes to choose from. Lindbergh aborted his first takeoff attempt on a windy day with his completed Jenny. Lindbergh spent a week practicing at Souther before he finally departed for the barnstorming circuit. In 1928, Sumter County purchased the property. William J. Graham of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania founded the Graham Aviation Company in April 1938. By the end of 1940, Graham Aviation managed eight airports in western Pennsylvania and operated several pilot schools as well as one flight instructor school. The Army Air Corps asked Graham if he would consider establishing a Contract Pilot School. A pilot, who had trained at Souther during World War I, suggested the former airfield to Graham for his school. Graham and his staff came to Americus and inspected the site. Finding it satisfactory, he leased the property from Sumter County. The army deactivated Souther Field at the end of World War II and deeded the land to Americus. In 1948 a portion of Souther Field was chartered for the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School (later South Georgia Technical College). Two of the three World War II hangars built by Graham Aviation are still standing, one on the college's campus. The warehouse that had served the field since 1918 is privately owned and stands at the western edge of the campus. Souther Field's World War II–era concrete apron (in which are embedded iron tie-downs that secured the Stearman biplane trainers) today is used for campus parking. Opposite the college campus and separated by a stand of trees, today's modernized Souther Field is a public-use airport. In 1978 Griffin Bell, an Americus native, presented a memorial plaque to Souther Field Airport to commemorate Charles Lindbergh's 1927 solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1992 a seven-foot bronze statue of Lindbergh, made by University of Georgia art professor and sculptor William J. Thompson, was dedicated. The statue, commissioned by the Sumter County Historic Preservation Society, stands at Souther Field as part of the airport's Lindbergh Monument. Americus celebrated \\"Lindbergh Days\\" in 1985 with a public festival and the installation of a state historical marker. Lindbergh's original JN-4 Jenny biplane, purchased and built at Souther Field, is on display at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Nassau County, New York. On October 11, 2009, the Americus and Sumter County Airport Authority approved Souther Field's renaming as Jimmy Carter Regional Airport. The new name was initially proposed jointly by the Sumter County Board of Commissioners and the Americus City Council. References * Shettle, M. L.

Amoako (born 1944 Accra) is a Ghanaian international civil servant with a career spanning more than four decades, who has contributed with energy to Africa’s ongoing development. He is a respected thought leader on policies and initiatives that have led to improved governance and growth on the continent, and he has worked alongside prominent development specialists to tackle the most pressing African and global development issues. Early Career After obtaining a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California-Berkeley in 1974, Amoako began his career at the World Bank. At the time, the Bank employed very few Africans, but it impacted much of the continent’s destiny through lending policies that were not always favorable to Africa. Amoako became Division Chief for Country Programs in the Africa Region and also Division Chief for Sector Programs in the Latin America and Caribbean Region. Over a ten-year period, he helped improve Bank operations in several countries. In the early 1990s, the Bank began to shift its focus by placing greater emphasis on poverty reduction and underserved but vital economic and social development issues, such as gender equality. To provide intellectual leadership in these areas, guide operational staff at the country-level, and collaborate more effectively with United Nations agencies and other development institutions, the Bank created the Department of Education and Social Policy in 1992. Amoako was appointed its first director. He led a group of 40 economists and sector specialists in producing major Bank policy papers on poverty, gender, social protection, labor markets, and education that were endorsed by the World Bank’s Executive Directors. UN Career In 1995, then UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appointed Amoako as the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) at the level of Under-Secretary General. He gave Amoako a mandate to transform the institution into an influential voice for Africa and an effective player in global development. Amoako’s appointment came at a critical time for Africa. After decades of economic stagnation, civil unrest, and political turmoil, there were indications that the continent’s fortunes could turn around with a stronger commitment to better governance and increased support from development partners. Unfortunately, the ECA, which boasted a rich history as a top African institution, was not in a position to meet its mandate due to years of ineffective operations. Within two years of his appointment, Amoako implemented sweeping reforms to remake the institution. Boutros-Ghali later commended the ECA for being “at the vanguard of reform in the United Nations.”  Contributions to African and Global Development  Over the past twenty years, Amoako has served on many high-level commissions and task forces with other development experts and leaders. These task forces and commissions have tackled Africa’s current and future challenges as well as global development issues. They include: * Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa—Chaired by Amoako, the Commission was established in 2003 by Kofi Annan. The commission had a mandate to clarify the data on the impact of HIV/AIDS on state structures and economic development and to assist governments in consolidating the design and implementation of policies and programs to help govern the epidemic. *Commission for Africa—Set up in 2004 and chaired by then British Prime Minister Tony Blair to promote development in Africa, the commission published its report, “Our Common Interest,” in 2005. Many of the recommendations were taken up by the G8 at its summit in Gleneagles later that year, and in other commitments made to Africa. *Commission on Macroeconomics and Health— The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (CMH) was established by then WHO Director-General Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland in January 2000 to assess the contribution of health to global economic development. Prof. Jeffrey Sachs chaired the commission. *International Task Force on Global Public Goods—Established in 2003 by the Swedish and French governments on the heels of the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development, the task force provided a definition of global public goods, identified global public goods critical for poverty reduction, and proposed recommendations to enhance their provision and financing. *Commission on Capital Flows to Africa—Jointly assembled in September 2002 by the Corporate Council on Africa and the Institute for International Economics and chaired by James A. Harmon, former chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, the Commission published a “Ten-Year Strategy for Increasing Capital Flows to Africa” to help boost capital and private sector investment from the United States. *High-Level Trade Experts Group—Set up by David Cameron and Angela Merkel to revitalize the Doha Round of trade talks and lobby for strong political commitment during the Seoul G20 summit to liberalize trade, the group was led by Peter Sutherland, the former Director- General of the WTO, and Jagdish Bhagwati, a renowned professor of economics at Columbia University. Speaking at a meeting of African finance ministers in 1997, Amoako declared himself “an optimist for Africa”.  The African Center for Economic Transformation  Amoako founded the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET) in 2008 to help African governments transform their economies and address policy and institutional barriers to economic growth, with operations based in Accra, Ghana.  Know the Beginning Well: An Inside Journey Through Five Decades of African Development  The title of the book is based on one of K.Y. Amoako's favorite African proverbs: \\"If you know the beginning well, the end shall not trouble you\\". As K.Y. Amoako has lived through and dedicated his career to African and international development, he draws on his five decades of experience to offer a vivid account of the people, policies, and institutions that have shaped Africa's post-colonial development history, all with an eye toward learning from the past to better inform the future. And he does so with the insights of someone who has lived that history, working directly with governments and global leaders on issues that continue to underpin African progress. Financing sustainable development. Moving beyond aid. Industrializing and diversifying economics. Closing the gender gap. Getting regional integration right. And above, all else, attaining accountable and transformative leadership. This book weaves a personal story of growth alongside that of Africa - with all the aspirations, setbacks, and successes hat it entails--and it offers a hopeful vision of a continent transformed.

Storylines Summer arrives as an undergraduate at Hollyoaks Community College who has moved to Chester and who seems to have an interfering mother constantly phoning her to check if she is okay. John Paul and Katy spot her conversing with her mother on the phone and realise a pair of underwear has dropped from her suitcase as she gathers her bags and walks off to find the admissions office. John Paul screams for her but she does not hear him. Later, while dining at Il Gnosh the two spot her again where John Paul timidly returns the pair of underwear to her and introduces himself. The two strike up a friendship and while walking through the college, she talks lots about herself and her passion for the performing arts. John Paul invites her for a drink, which Katy does not join them, probably as she finds her a bit full on. While John Paul strikes up a conversation with Jay, Summer befriends Russ while sitting at the bar. While attending John Paul's housewarming party at the halls, Summer caught the eye of Kris Fisher. The carbon monoxide leak from the faulty boiler rendered her unconscious along with all the other people in the party, Summer was drowsy but recovered at the scene, she was given the all clear by doctors and was told to go home. At a swimming pool in which O.B. had taken Tom to teach him how to swim O.B. saw Summer and started chatting her up. He was so busy talking to her that he didn't notice Tom taking his armbands off before jumping in and having to be saved by Simon Crosby. Summer then started working at MOBs where it was obvious that O.B. had a crush on her and she clashed with Max Cunningham's girlfriend Steph Dean who she worked with and originally met after they both went for a part to star in a health and safety video. After running into Nancy Hayton and Sarah Barnes, the trio decided to go for a drink. When a guy walked into the SU Bar, when Sarah said \\"Ooh,I'd have a bit of that!\\",where Nancy replied \\"No,he's not my type\\", before Summer noticed him, and called out \\"James!\\" Nancy and Sarah both looked horrified by what they said. James, Summer's long-term boyfriend, is in the Army and tells Summer he's on leave because he is to spend five months in Afghanistan - and he leaves the next day. Summer considered asking him to stay, before a heart-to-heart with Sarah, who asked her \\"what if you landed a part in a Broadway show?\\" \\"I'd ask him to come with me\\" \\"For him to drop everything to follow your dreams, when you wouldn't let him follow his?\\" Summer understood that she couldn't have it all her way, and let him go, after telling him \\"if you get yourself killed out there I'll murder you!\\" \\"You say that every time!\\" The pair kiss, and James left in a taxi. On the 15 November 2007 Summer received a phone call from James. After the credits had ended she was crying and told O.B. that it was over between her and James, she ran off leaving O.B. alone at The Dog in The Pond. Summer recently shared a kiss with Kris Fisher after their radio show was taken over by 'pirates' aka John Paul McQueen and Elliot Bevan. But then it was revealed that they are a couple when she tells OB \\"I never would have thought I would have a boyfriend who looked better than me in lipgloss.\\" However, after realising her feelings for OB, she breaks up with Kris claiming he is too high maintenance. This results in quite a nasty argument between them - Kris calling Summer shallow while Summer stated that cross-dressing didn't make him any more special, and that he 'wakes up in the morning and thinks, who shall I be today, male or female?' Later Kris sees Summer having lunch with OB and is angry, but when OB defends her Kris and OB 'fight', ending in Summer pouring water over them. On 25 January 2008, after Steph suggested that they should form a band, Summer decided she'd had enough of life in Hollyoaks and wanted to try her luck at living in London. She wanted to be able to chase her dreams and not wait for the opportunities to come to her. She asked O.B. to go with her but he refused saying that he couldn't let Max down by leaving. After one last-ditch attempt to convince O.B. to come with her, she walked out the door. Later, Max convinced O.B. to leave with Summer, saying that she is the best thing that's ever happened to him. They race to the bus station in the MOBs van, arriving just as the bus is about to leave. O.B. hopped on the bus and tells Summer that she only asked him twice to leave and everyone knows that it's three times for luck. After a hug and a kiss, they departed for London with Max looking on. After arriving in London, Summer sets about trying to find Andrew Lloyd Webber so that she can try to get a part in one of his musicals. On 1 February 2008, despite her nerves during an audition, Summer has successfully been offered a part of Maria in The Sound Of Music, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals. On 15 February 2008, Summer made her exit from Hollyoaks, leading a new life to star in one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals. But with O.B.'s second thoughts about moving out, Summer realises she has to start a new life alone, even without him. On 28 February 2008, O.B. chased his dream and him and Summer got back together, with him remaining in London with her to start their new life. This is the last time she is seen onscreen.

Blackie Academic and Professional: Glasgow, 1994 Cyanate esters based on a bisphenol or novolac derivative are used in the production of resins.Kessler, M. R. 2012. Cyanate Ester Resins. Wiley Encyclopedia of Composites. 1–15, doi: 10.1002/9781118097298.weoc062 Use in resins Chemical structure of bisphenol A cyanate ester, used in cyanate resins Cyanate esters can be cured and postcured by heating, either alone at elevated temperatures or at lower temperatures in presence of a suitable catalyst. The most common catalysts are transition metal complexes of cobalt, copper, manganese and zinc. The result is a thermoset material with a very high glass- transition temperature (Tg) of up to 400 °C, and a very low dielectric constant, providing excellent long term thermal stability at elevated end use temperatures, very good fire, smoke and toxicity performance and specific suitability for printed circuit boards installed in critical electrical devices. This is also due to its low moisture uptake. This property, together with a higher toughness compared to epoxies, also makes it a valuable material in aerospace applications. For example, the Lynx Mark II spaceplane is primarily made of carbon/cyanate ester. The chemistry of the cure reaction is a trimerization of three CN groups to a triazine ring. When the monomer contains two cyanate groups the resulting structure is a 3D polymer network. Thermoset polymer matrix properties can be fine tuned by the choice of substituents in the bisphenolic compound. Bisphenol A and novolac based cyanate esters are the major products; bisphenol F and bisphenol E are also used. The aromatic ring of the bisphenol can be substituted with an allylic group for improved toughness of the material. Cyanate esters can also be mixed with bismaleimides to form BT-resins or with epoxy resins to optimize the end use properties.

The building has long served as the icon of the University and was noted for its bell tower that chimed every quarter-hour. The bell tower does not chime anymore, due to it being moved to Butler Chapel.  History  The need for Kivett Hall arose after most of the buildings on the campus of Buies Creek Academy, the forerunner of Campbell University, located in Buies Creek, NC were destroyed by fire. Founded by the Reverend James Archibald Campbell in 1887. the academy grew and eventually consisted of several buildings, all constructed of wood. On Wednesday night December 20, 1900 a fire destroyed many buildings, including the main classroom building. Kivett was completed on November 2, 1903 and in its early days served as the primary building of the Academy, a rural school that educated children form Kindergarten to the 12th grade. The building was named for Zachary Taylor Kivett, known to all as Z. T. Kivett was a relatively prosperous land owner, contractor and builder well established in the local community. He lived on his farm, the “plantation”, located on the other side of the Cape Fear River from Buies Creek with his wife Lillian Lee née. McNeill. At the time they had a large family consisting of Archibald Steward, 19; twins Hector Hendricks and Hugh Herndon, 17; Virginia Elizabeth, 14; Caroline McNeill, 12; Louise McKay, 9; Neil McNeill, 6; Edward Henry, 3; and Robert Commack, 1. They had also lost two children in infancy Caroline McNeill, born in 1888 lived less than a year, and David born in 1890 lived only two days. During the ensuring years Z. T. and Lillian had three more children Willis Ervin, 1902, and twins again, Mary Herndon and Mildred McNeill, 1909. Eventually fathering 14 children, Z. T. was obviously not only prosperous but productive, so his future pledge of his family was not insignificant to Rev. Campbell. In a handwritten letter to Dr. Joseph McKay, a trustee of the school, dated September 10, 1923, Kivett relates the details of his meeting with the Reverend Campbell the morning after the fire. > I am quite sure you are well acquainted with the general movement of affairs > about Buies Creek Academy from its early struggle on through the passing > years to the present high place it fills in the County and State. But as to > details of every one's part in this advance, you perhaps are not so well > acquainted, and would like to be a little better informed, as I judge from > your desire to have some kind of a statement along this line of my own > connections with the work. Perhaps none of those connected with the school > on the night of December 20, 1900 will ever forget how quickly 14 years of > their labor and toil went up in smoke and drifted out of the community in > lowering clouds and drizzling rain.

T. spent the remainder of the winter months working on plans for the new brick school building. A self-taught architect and structural engineer, some saw his proposed building as overly ambitious, ostentatious and out of scale. It was also over engineered with solid brick exterior and interior supporting walls. He estimated the construction cost of the new building at $15,000, which was not even remotely available. Nonetheless he began digging the foundation in early 1901, and the cornerstone was laid on May 23, 1901. As the primary construction material was to be of fire resistant brick, the bricks were to be funded by donations solicited by Rev. Campbell. He had printed 1,000 “Brick Envelopes” each to be filled with $5.00, enough to fund fifty bricks. The envelopes were distributed widely by students, friends and supporters. Prominent among these supporters was Mr. Josephus Daniels of the Raleigh News and Observer. He gave prominent coverage of the fire and rebuilding plans in the paper, and, through the paper, started a fund raising campaign when he wrote “Public spirited men ought to rally to his (Dr. Campbell's) assistance in rebuilding.” Indeed, the community did rally, donations were made, fund raising suppers were held, special church offerings were collected and slowly funds were available. Not an abundance, but enough to provide hope and to proceed with the construction project. Work then slowed somewhat with the details for the materials for the project. Z. T. purchased land less a fourth of a mile from the construction site from Mr. Richard B. Crowder. On this land he set up a steam-powered saw mill and a brick kiln. Needing to be closer to the construction site, as he was the sole contractor and foreman, Z. T. also constructed a “shanty” on the site. Built of rough-cut wood, the one-room building was furnished with five bunks, wood-burning stove, washstand, shelving and benches. A porch across the front provided some shade, and a wood fence enclosed the front yard. Into this primitive accommodation Z. T. moved himself and his oldest sons Stewart, Herndon and Hendricks and his daughter Virginia in the summer of 1901. Virginia did the cooking and housekeeping for the men while they lived in the shanty. By April 1902 they were ready to begin production of timbers and bricks for the construction of the new building. The sons would supervise the operation of the saw mill and the brick kiln, which operated 24 hours a day. According to the April 5, 2007 edition of The Campbell Times, \\"Kivett got some extra help from a flood in May 1901, as a fully equipped sawmill floated downstream and was recovered after the flood waters receded.\\" Will Kivett Hall See the Wrecking Ball? The Campbell Times (Buies Creek, N.C.) 05 April 2007 (accessed 14 Sep 2007)] Everett McNeill Kivette's The McNeill’s Ferry Chronicle and Campbell University says, \\"If Z.T. was not being given a mill, he could surely entertain the idea – and that strongly – that God intended him to borrow it for a time.\\"The McNeill’s Ferry Chronicle and Campbell University By Everett M. Kivette, Yancy Graphics, 1983 For 28 months Z. T. and his family devoted themselves full-time to the construction project. They were assisted by the Buies Creek Academy students, by volunteers, and paid craftsmen, especially masons and carpenters. Finally on November 2, 1903 the building was complete. The Catalogue of Buie’s Creek Academy and Business College For The Scholastic Year 1902–1903 describes “Our New Building” as > Our new brick building is one of the most imposing and well arranged school > buildings in the State, corner-stone of which was laid May 23rd, 1901. The > main building is long, wide, with a wing on the rear long,- and wide, all > two stories. The first floor contains four rooms each 35x40 feet, one room > 35x35 feet, and three music rooms.

Kivette, Yancy Graphics, 2007 Around the time of the start of the construction, Rev. Campbell had written in the January–February 1901 edition of the Little River Record: > To Mr. Z. T. Kivett, who came and took charge of the matter of planning and > pushing the work, to the students who spent their holidays in helping, to > the citizens of the community, to the newspapers, and to friends one and all > who in any way helped make it possible for the work to be done, we desire to > return our sincere and heartfelt thanks. As those words were true throughout the massive construction project, the new building was soon referred to as the Kivett Building. It was formally named Kivett Hall as Buies Creek Academy grew into Campbell College and then Campbell University. The building has served the surrounding community's various educational needs for generations, having been used as a grade school, high school, college classrooms, and since 1976, as the home of the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law and law library. Most recently in the 1990s, a new structure, Wiggins Memorial Library, was added to the east wall of Kivett and greatly expanded the Law School and law library. The renovation of the structure was recognized at the time “as an example of adaptive renovation and historic preservation.” But such praise may have been made by those who did not have an understanding of the changes to the building. Interior partition masonry walls that provided support for upper floors and the roof structure were removed as were parts of flooring that provided bracing for the exterior walls. And though engineering remediation was attempted, time has brought much havoc on the building. Presently the building is partially blocked off and considered structurally unsound. There is great concern in the local community and among students, alumni, and friends of the University as to the future of Kivett Hall. Some even fear that the building may be demolished as the University proceeds with its long term campus renovation plan. These concerns have been expressed in several newspaper articles  Future  Kivett Hall, note the temporary upper facade on the building's west wing The building, though renovated in 1993, has suffered structural decline since 2005. A number of alumni and concerned citizens of the Buies Creek community have organized meetings to debate the future of the building, but a final decision of its fate has not yet been determined by the University.Campbell's 'heart' in jeopardy The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) (accessed 14 Sep 2007)Campbell might move law school to Raleigh The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) (accessed 14 Sep 2007) The future use of the building by the University is now undetermined following the October 4, 2007 announcement that the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law will be moving to downtown Raleigh, North Carolina by the fall of 2009.It's official: Campbell law school moving The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)

Smith, was an American restaurateur, model, author, businesswoman and television host.  Early life and education  Smith was born on August 24, 1949, in the Pittsburgh suburb of Everson, Pennsylvania. Her mother, Florence, was a maid and her father, William, a steelworker. Smith was raised in Scottdale, Pennsylvania, and attended Southmoreland High School, being graduated in 1967.  Career  = Modeling, television, and stage = In the mid-1960s, Smith began her career in modeling, participating in the Ebony Fashion Fair and later signing with the Wilhelmina Models agency. Smith was the first African-American model to be featured on the cover of Mademoiselle magazine in 1976. Smith made two appearances on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, once as a model for Queen Sara's wedding dress, and once giving a tour of her restaurant, B. Smith, and making raspberry custard with Fred Rogers and her head chef, Henry. During the episode, she taught child viewers about the importance of washing hands, and shared the excitement of using huge bowls and mixers. She said her dream was to feed people, which began at an early age when she fed her dolls. Her weekly half-hour syndicated television show, B. Smith With Style, debuted in 1997 and also aired weekdays on BTN and Bounce TV. It featured home decor and cooking segments. Smith appeared as herself on \\"Prelude to a Kiss\\", a 1999 episode of the sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch, in which Aunt Hilda summons her in order to teach a group of unruly pirates to keep house. Smith accepted a role in the Off Broadway play Love, Loss, and What I Wore for an April 27 through May 29, 2011, run with Conchata Ferrell, AnnaLynne McCord, Anne Meara, and Minka Kelly. = Restaurateur and retailer = Smith owned multiple restaurants called B. Smith. The first opened in 1986, on Eighth Avenue at 47th Street in New York City, and several years later moved around the corner to Restaurant Row on 46th Street; followed by another one in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York. She also owned a restaurant in the historic Beaux-Arts Union Station in Washington, D.C.; in September 2013, it was reported that restaurant would close. In 2014, the Sag Harbor restaurant was shuttered, followed by the Manhattan location in January 2015. Smith's interest in décor and restaurant design led to the development of her first home collection, which debuted at Bed, Bath & Beyond in Spring 2001. She also launched a line of serveware in 2004. In spring 2007, Smith debuted her first furniture collection with the La-Z-Boy company Clayton Marcus. = Author = B. Smith authored three books concentrating on recipes and presentation: B.

Smith and her husband released Before I Forget in early 2016, detailing their journey following her diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's. The book was written with husband Dan Gasby and Vanity Fair contributing editor Michael Shnayerson.  Personal life  Smith married twice and although she had no biological children, she was stepmother to Dana Gasby. Her first marriage was to former HBO executive Donald \\"Don\\" Anderson from 1986 until 1990. Smith began dating Anderson after formally meeting him at her restaurant in late 1986. Smith married Dan Gasby in 1992 at St. Luke's Lutheran Church in Manhattan.

He was best known for his work in developing AMG (Advancing the Ministries of the Gospel) International, a Christian missions and relief agency with operations in over 40 countries, and for publishing The Hebrew-Greek KeyWord Study BibleAMG Publishers, Chattanooga, 1998 which indexes key terms in the English Bible with the words they were translated from in the original languages. Life Zodhiates was born of Greek parents on the island of Cyprus. His father first brought the family to Port Said, Egypt and then Khartoum, Sudan, looking for work. Spiros's brother, Argos Zodhiates, was converted to Protestant Christianity after hearing an evangelical preacher and brought this witness to his mother and brother, who also became convinced of its truth. After neglecting to kiss a Greek Orthodox priest's hand, Zodhiates was expelled from school. A lady named Katherine took pity on him and volunteered to teach the boy English. After completing his Greek education, he attended the American University in Cairo, Egypt, received his Th.B. degree from the National Bible Institute (later Shelton College, which closed its doors in 1990) in New York City, and his M.A. from New York University. In 1978 he earned his Doctor of Theology degree from Luther Rice Seminary of Jacksonville, Florida. He was also the recipient of several honorary doctorates. He came to the United States in 1946 at the invitation of the American Committee for the Evangelization of the Greeks (now AMG International), of which he became president in 1966. Under Zodhiates' leadership, AMG grew from a small ministry focusing on the land of Greece to a worldwide evangelistic and relief ministry. AMG, founded in 1943 in New York City and presently located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, provides a wide range of social services, including care for orphans and leprosy patients, and has an expanding evangelistic thrust of “Advertising the Message of the Gospel” through paid newspaper and magazine gospel messages in many lands and languages. In 1951, Zodhiates’ passion for radio was born when he realized the power of media to get the message of Christianity to the masses. Using his Greek background and knowledge of the Greek language as a springboard, Zodhiates took to the airwaves, teaching the New Testament in light of the original Greek meaning of the words used. Zodhiates’ program, New Testament Light, began on one station in rural Pennsylvania, and in its heyday was heard across the United States and Canada. As his career progressed, Zodhiates became a recognized authority on the Greek New Testament. His Bible teaching carried from radio into other media as well. In 1975, he launched Pulpit Helps Magazine, a monthly publication designed to provide pastors with insights from the original languages of the Bible, tips on sermon construction, illustrative stories to enhance Bible teaching, and news from Christian missions around the world. Pulpit Helps still serves thousands of readers in the United States and other English-speaking countries. New Testament Light was developed into a television show during the 1980s and was broadcast on numerous stations through the mid-1990s. Books In addition to The Hebrew-Greek KeyWord Study Bible, Zodhiates published over 200 books and booklets in English, as well as 82 in Greek, many of which are in-depth word- by-word commentaries on the books of the New Testament. He started a book house, AMG Publishers, which has since grown into a significant producer of Christian books, to publish much of his material. He was also responsible for introducing the Modern Greek pronunciation of Classical and Koine Greek into U.S. colleges and universities through A Guide to Modern Greek Pronunciation and his tape recordings of the entire Koine New Testament (Nestle's text) in Modern Greek pronunciation. He recorded with Modern Greek pronunciation special courses on New Testament Greek for those who wish to learn it on their own or in classrooms, using texts such as J. Gresham Machen's New Testament Greek for Beginners, Summers', Davis', and Hadjiantoniou's grammars. After suffering numerous health problems in the late 1990s, Zodhiates transitioned out of active work, though many of his commentary manuscripts are still being edited and published, and his radio and television recordings are being redistributed digitally. He died in Chattanooga on October 10, 2009.

Biography Barton was born on November 17, 1786, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father William Barton, a lawyer, was the designer of the Great Seal of the United States. His uncle, Benjamin Smith Barton (1766–1815) was an eminent medical botanist and vice-president of the American Philosophical Society. =Education= As was customary for the era, Barton pursued a classical education at Princeton University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1805. The curriculum included Aristotelian logic, and study of the Greek and Latin languages. While he was at Princeton, each member of his class assumed the name of some celebrated man. The one he chose was Count Paul Crillon, and the initials P. C. were retained by him the rest of his life. Barton began studying medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1805 under his uncle, Benjamin Smith Barton, who was a renowned botanist and author of the first American text book on botanical science. In these years of study, William Barton's interest in botany and the natural sciences grew into a lifelong passion. In 1808, upon publication of A Dissertation on Chymical Properties and Exhilarating Effects of Nitrous Oxide Gas and Its Application to Pneumatick Medicine, Barton received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Complete with an illustration of a giddy man breathing in “laughing gas” from a sheep's bladder, the treatise had great impact on scientific thought when nitrous oxide experiments were “generally derided as extravagant and imaginary.”Barton, WPC. A Dissertation on Chymical Properties and Exhilarating Effects of Nitrous Oxide Gas and Its Application to Pneumatick Medicine. Philadelphia: Lorenzo Pres, 1808: pages xiii–v. =U.S. Naval Surgeon= At the age of 23, Barton chose to enter the U.S. Navy as a surgeon. He received his commission on April 10, 1809, and less than week later commissioned the famous Thomas Sully to paint his portrait for a sum of $50. This painting, now in the Wilstach Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, shows a young Barton in uniform – a blue coat with gold braid, and hands gloved. Barton wrote, “I was overwhelmed with the difficulties I had to encounter in the performance of professional duties, where every species of inconvenience and disadvantage that can be imagined was opposed to the exertions of the surgeon.”Barton, WPC. A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy. 1st ed. Philadelphia; privately printed, 1814. page xiii Ultimately, Barton was not one to accept inadequacies, but rather to fight for reform. Barton fought to tighten the controls of shipboard medical supplies. He called for the introduction of lemons and limes aboard Navy ships long before the U.S. Navy accepted the importance of an antiscorbutic treatment for vitamin C deficiency or scurvy. Barton went as far as to send a bottle of lime juice to the Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton with the instructions to drink it in the form of lemonade.Barton, WPC. A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy. 1st ed. Philadelphia; privately printed, 1814. pages 147–155 His outspoken manner angered many of his colleagues. Barton, of necessity, became familiar with the administration of hospitals. In February, 1811, Congress passed an act establishing naval hospitals. Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton later asked Barton to compose a set of regulations for governing these hospitals. Barton was well aware of the shortcomings in Navy medical care. Shipboard facilities were primitive, and there were no permanent hospitals ashore, only temporary facilities in Navy yards. Barton began by drafting rules for governing naval hospitals. In 1812, the Navy Department submitted them to Congress. \\"Each hospital accommodating at least one hundred men should maintain a staff including a surgeon, who must be a college or university graduate; two surgeon's mates; a steward; a matron; a wardmaster; four permanent nurses; and a variety of servants.\\" Not satisfied with the hastily drafted suggestions, Barton expanded his theories in a treatise published in 1814. He was the first to promote the idea of employing female nurses in the U.S. Navy. He described the \\"matron's characteristics: she should be \\"discreet ... reputable ... capable ... neat, cleanly, and tidy in her dress, and urbane and tender in her deportment.\\" She would supervise the nurses and other attendants as well as those working in the laundry, larder, and kitchen, but her main function was to ensure that patients were clean, well-fed, and comfortable. William Barton serves on naval board, June 11, 1824 By 1824, Barton served on the first board to examine candidates for the Navy's medical service. The intent of the board was to examine Surgeon's Mates, \\"preparatory to their promotion to the rank of Surgeons.\\" The board was also authorized to examine applicants for Commissions as Surgeons' Mates and report upon their fitness. In 1830 he became the commanding officer at Naval Hospital Norfolk, VA. He was involved in the development of the Philadelphia Naval Hospital when it was located in the Naval Asylum. Today, this gothic structure, that also served as the first home of the U.S. Naval Academy, stands in Grays Ferry. President John Tyler appointed Barton to the office of first head of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery on September 2, 1842. (The post of Navy Surgeon General was created in March 1871). His time as Chief clerk was active, but short. Among his recommendations were the adoption of a supply table so that drugs and medical supplies could be properly procured and accounted for; the abolition of a venereal fee; uniform standards for recruits; higher professional standards for Navy physicians; standardizations and administrations of naval hospitals; and strict control over the use of liquor on board ships. He was a vehement prohibitionist, and had a “liquor circular” pasted on boxes of whisky identifying the contents as medical supplies which required stringent accounting, a step which was not popular in the fleet. =Treatise on U.S. Navy hospitals= His A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy (1814) contained recommendations of reform for the already new Navy hospital system. He urged that U.S. Navy hospitals should be modeled after British medical facilities. One of his many recommendations recommended that all hospital property should be marked “U.S. Naval Hospital” to prevent theft.Barton, WPC. A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy. 1st ed. Philadelphia; privately printed, 1814. pages 38–39 The mere fact of the book having achieved a second edition three years later, is an indication of the estimation in which it was held. It contained a fund of information collected from various sources, both at home and abroad, and revealed an originality of thought and expression which stamped its author as far in advance of the times.Pleadwell, Frank L., Capt. \\"Edward Cutbush, M.D.: The Nestor of the Medical Corps of the Navy.\\" Annals of Medical History 5 (1923): page 267 =Pennsylvania academics= On the death of his uncle Benjamin Smith Barton in 1815, William Barton became professor of botany at the University of Pennsylvania, and for years much of Barton's time was dedicated to the teaching of Materia Medica, or medical botany, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Thomas Jefferson Medical College. One of his prominent students was Dr. Samuel D. Gross, later immortalized in the Thomas Eakins painting The Gross Clinic (1876). Gross portrayed his old teacher as a colorful character in a speech delivered to Alumni Association of Thomas Jefferson Medical College on March 11, 1871. From 1828–1829, Barton also served as the Dean of Jefferson Medical College. He was a fellow of the college of physicians in Philadelphia, president of the Linnaean Society, and a member of the American Philosophical Society, and other scientific societies. =Personal life= His brother was John Rhea Barton (1796–1871), the originator of corrective osteotomy for joint ankylosis. He invented both the \\"Barton bandage\\" (a figure eight bandage that provides support below and anterior to the lower jaw), and Barton forceps (obstetrical forceps with one fixed, curved blade and lunged anterior blade for application to a high transverse position of the head). The Barton Collection at Boston Public Library is named after Benjamin Smith Barton's son Thomas Pennant Barton (1803–1869), who was William Barton's first cousin. It comprises one of largest and most valuable Shakespeare collections in the world. Barton was married to Esther Sergeant the grand daughter of David Rittenhouse, the great American astronomer and President of the American Philosophical Society. Esther Barton colored many of Dr. Barton's botanical drawings. He died on March 27, 1856 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

It is a mixture of epoxy resin, a common raw material for PCBs and BT resins. BT stands for Bismaleimide-Triazine resin. This is in turn a mixture of bismaleimide, which is also used as a raw material for PCBs and cyanate ester. Three cyano groups of the cyanate ester are trimerized to a triazine ring structure, hence the T in the name. In presence of a bismaleimide, the double bond of the maleimide group can copolymerize with the cyano groups to heterocyclic 6-membered aromatic ring structures with two nitrogen atoms (pyrimidines). The cure reaction occurs at temperatures up to 250 degrees C, and is catalyzed by strongly basic molecules like Dabco (diazabicyclooctane) and 4-DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridin). Products with very high glass transition temperatures (Tg)- up to 300 degrees C - and very low dielectric constant can be obtained. These properties make these materials very attractive for use in PCBs, which are often subjected to such conditions.  Applications of Epoxy  Epoxy resin coatings have long been used in marine, construction, and industrial environments for the high level of protection they offer as a final coating. That strength and clarity has increasingly been used by craftspeople and artists according to the Chicago Tribune. Such sort of flooring is discovered to be very beneficial in food industry where spillage of oil and food can produce the floor slippery. Epoxy flooring is highly advised for warehouse floors. While practical, it can also be stylish. It is very versatile and comes in a wide variety of colors too. It is a true low maintenance option. In such a situation, it is the best possible solution.

A flash of unstyled content (FOUC, also flash of unstyled text) is an instance where a web page appears briefly with the browser's default styles prior to loading an external CSS stylesheet, due to the web browser engine rendering the page before all information is retrieved. The page corrects itself as soon as the style rules are loaded and applied; however, the shift may be distracting. Related problems include flash of invisible text (FOIT) and flash of faux text (FOFT).  Technical information  The issue was documented in an article named \\"Flash of Unstyled Content\\". At first, FOUC appeared to be a browser problem unique to Internet Explorer but later became apparent in other browsers, and has since been described as \\"a Safari epidemic\\". FOUC is indifferent to changes in CSS or HTML versions. The problem originates from a set of priorities programmed into the browser. As the browser collects HTML and all the ancillary files referenced in the markup, the browser builds the Document Object Model on-the- fly. The browser may choose to first display the text, which it can parse the quickest. FOUC is more prevalent now that HTML pages are more apt to reference multiple style sheets. Web pages often include style references to media other than the browser screen, such as CSS rules for printers and mobile devices. Web pages may import layers of style files, and reference alternative style sheets. Online advertisements and other inserted offsite content, like videos and search engines, often dictate their own style rules within their code block. The cascading nature of CSS rules encourages some browsers to wait until all the style data is collected before applying it. With the advent of JavaScript libraries such as jQuery that can be employed to further define and apply the styling of a web page, FOUC has also become more prominent. In an attempt to avoid unstyled content, front-end developers may choose to hide all content until it is fully loaded, at which point a load event handler is triggered and the content appears. To emulate a FOUC, developers can use browser add-ons that are capable of disabling a web page's CSS on the fly. Firebug and Async CSS are such add-ons. While, by 2016, several different techniques had been developed to avoid undesired display behaviours, a change in rendering behaviour in Google Chrome version 50, whereby stylesheets injected by JavaScript are prevented from blocking page loading, as required by the HTML5 specification, brought the situation to website creators' attentions again, particularly affecting users of Typekit, a web typography product from Adobe Systems. Within 2 months, Adobe had changed the way in which their fonts were included into third-party websites in order to avoid the undesired rendering behaviour.

SR 142 was originally introduced in 1934 to connect Eminence to SR 39. The road was paved by the late 1960s.  Route description  SR 142 begins at an intersection with SR 42 in Eminence in western Morgan County. The highway proceeds due east into Morgan County as a two-lane road, passing through farmland. The road becomes curvy as it enters a wooded area. SR 142 passes through the unincorporated community of Wilbur, before ending at SR 39. The highest traffic count is at the eastern end of SR 142, where 1,557 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. The lowest traffic count is west of Wilbur, where 1,045 vehicles travel the highway on average each day. History The Indiana State Highway Commission designated SR 142 in 1934. The original routing started at SR 42 in Eminence and ran east to SR 39 much as it does today. The road between Eminence and Wilbur had a gravel or stone surface, while the road east of Wilbur was under construction. In 1935 the construction east of Wilbur was completed and the road surface was either gravel or stone. The highway commissioned paved the entire road between 1966 and 1967.

Porsche had left Formula One at the end of after four years supplying TAG-badged turbo engines to the McLaren team, but decided to return two years later with a view to creating a V12 engine for the newly introduced 3.5-litre normally-aspirated regulations (hence this engine's designation of 3512). After a partnership with the small Onyx team was suggested, in early 1990 the company signed a four-year deal with Footwork Arrows, to commence in . The 3512 was designed by Porsche veteran Hans Mezger, and had an 80-degree V-angle and a power take-off from the centre of the engine. The latter had been a feature of the flat-12 Type 912 engine (also designed by Mezger) in the Porsche 917 sports car of the early 1970s, but was unusual for Formula One. Problems beset the 3512 almost immediately, as it was completed later than scheduled, and its layout meant that it was large and heavy. When ancillaries like the clutch and flywheel were installed, the engine weighed 418 lb (189.6 kg) - compared to the V12s of Honda and Ferrari at 352 lb (159.6 kg) and 308 lb (139.7 kg) respectively. All this meant that it could not be properly installed in Footwork's car for the 1991 season, the FA12, and so the team had to redesign this car while starting the season with a modified version of their / car, designated the A11C. Further difficulties were encountered when the engine started to be used: power output was said to be only around at around 13,000 rpm, while the novel method of drawing power from the centre of the engine led to oil pressure problems. When the season got underway at the Phoenix street circuit in the United States, Alex Caffi failed to qualify his A11C, while teammate Michele Alboreto qualified 25th but retired from the race at half-distance with a gearbox failure. At the faster Interlagos circuit for the next round in Brazil, both drivers failed to make the grid. The redesigned FA12 was introduced at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, another fast circuit, but Alboreto destroyed his car during practice and was forced to use the A11C, and again both drivers failed to qualify. Then at Monaco, Caffi suffered a crash of his own and once again failed to make the grid, while Alboreto again qualified 25th before his 3512 failed at half- distance. By this stage, Footwork had already given up hope in the Porsche engine, and had decided to go back to the Ford Cosworth DFR V8 that had been used in 1989 and 1990. However, the team had to make do with the 3512 for the North American rounds in Canada and Mexico, for which Stefan Johansson took the place of Caffi, who had sustained injuries in a road accident. Both drivers managed to qualify at Montreal, Alboreto 21st and Johansson 25th, but retired with throttle and engine problems. Then in Mexico, after four of the team's seven engines for the weekend had failed on the Friday, Johansson failed to qualify, while Alboreto qualified 26th and last, only for his 3512 to fail again before half-distance. Footwork finally reverted to the DFR in time for the French Grand Prix, installed in a modification of the FA12, designated the FA12C. Porsche formally terminated its deal with the team shortly before the Japanese Grand Prix in October, and has not appeared in Formula One since. A V10 replacement for the 3512 was in development at the time of Porsche's withdrawal from Formula One. This engine would not be completed until several years later, when it was modified for use in the stillborn Porsche LMP project in 2000. The engine eventually became mass- produced when a further variant was chosen as the powerplant of the Porsche Carrera GT supercar. References External links * Photo of Porsche 3512 engine.

The diameter of the James Bruce Round Barn is 58 feet 8 inches (about 17.7 m). Its exterior is clad in wooden siding, known as \\"drop siding,\\" and it stands on a poured concrete foundation. The single hip roof is supported by a series of braces and topped with a cupola. The stave silo has a diameter of 12 feet (3.7 m) and is accessed on the barn's northeast side via a banked entrance. Animals entered the barn at grade level on the south side of the building. Above the south and northeast entrances are overshoots which extend from the wall diagonally and were meant to compensate for the building's lack of overall storm protection.Sculle, Keith A. \\"James Bruce Round Barn,\\" National Register of Historic Places Individual Property Form: Multiple Property Submission, October 1983, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 14 September 2007.The Bruce Round Barn features a single hip roof and a wooden central silo. The single hip roof design represents the evolution of round barn construction in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin. Furthermore, the inclusion of a central wooden silo on the Bruce Barn may represent the cumulative influence from Agricultural Experiment Stations at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Two of the three round barns designed at the University of Illinois experiment station feature the central silo.Burlinson, Audra and Lang-Kummer, Karen. \\"University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District,\\" National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, (PDF),, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, pp. 7, 10. Retrieved 14 September 2007. In the days before mechanization, round barns were seen as being useful because of their labor-saving features: the livestock could be fed in one pass around the barn, using the hay stored in the loft above the stock and the grain in the central silo. Cleaning out the manure likewise could be done in one circuit, with fewer wasted steps. The coming of machinery, especially with the Rural Electrification program, obviated labor-saving designs that were more complicated to build, and round barns faded into history. Significance The Bruce Round Barn is the last known round barn constructed by the team of Shaffer and the Haas Brothers. The design of the Bruce Barn is important in the evolution of general round barn design. The single hip roof construction, complete with a series of internal rafter braces for extra support are the result of the inability of some carpenters to complete the self-supporting roofs that round barns typically utilized. The Haas Brothers and Shaffer came up with two novel solutions to this problem. The first was to construct a conical roof, the second, which is exemplified in the Bruce Round Barn, was to construct a single hip roof.An example of the alternatively styled \\"double hip roof\\" in round barns can be seen in the Thomas Ranck Round Barn in Indiana. The University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station heavily influenced the roof style. The James Bruce Round Barn was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984. The Bruce Round Barn was part of the original National Register submission that accompanied the development of inclusion criteria for Illinois round barns. These types of specific inclusion criteria are known as multiple property submissions, and they outline basic criteria for National Register inclusion for properties of a certain type and attempt to put them into a historical context.Lee, Antoinette J. and McClelland Linda F. \\"How to Complete the National Register Multiple Property Documentation Form, (PDF), National Register Bulletin, 1991; 1999 (revised edition), National Park Service.

The song's title appears with varying punctuation in its different versions: this article indicates how each specific version styled the title. Originally, the film and the song did not share a title, the working title of the film being What Ever Happened to Cousin Charlotte? Reportedly, Bette Davis disliked the working title feeling it falsely indicated a sequel to What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and, the song with the opening lyric \\"Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte\\" having been written early in the film's development and having been played for Davis, she suggested Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte should serve as the movie's title.Charlotte Chandler. The Girl Who Walked Home Alone Simon & Schuster (NYC) 2006 p.244 In the storyline of the film, the song is written for Davis' character: the aging Southern belle Charlotte Hollis, by her would-be lover John Mayhew whose murder thirty-seven years ago is generally ascribed to Charlotte. The song also effectively functions as the film's theme as its lyrics in effect reference how Charlotte will obsess over her lost love throughout most of her life. The song's melody plays on a music box which Charlotte treasures, and is also a feature of the gaslighting to which Charlotte's subjected, as she hears the song played on the harpsichord while she tries to sleep. Davis as Charlotte is also seen playing the song on the harpsichord and singing the most lyrically complete version of the song heard in the film, the Al Martino recording of the song only being heard for one chorus under the film's closing credits. The \\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" song is heard in full as an instrumental - by the Frank DeVol Orchestra - under the film's opening credits, just prior to which a group of juvenile tormentors sing a debased version of the chorus, referencing Charlotte's supposed murder of John Mayhew. The Al Martino rendition of \\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" was relegated to the B-side of his January 1965 single release \\"My Heart Would Know\\" which reached #52 on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" would be featured on Martino's Somebody is Taking My Place album. When the song earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Song, Bette Davis herself reportedly was hoping to perform it:David Bret Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr Da Capo Press (Philadelphia PA) 2008 p. 244 however Patti Page performed \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" on the April 5, 1965 37th Academy Awards broadcast, Page singing the song from the perspective of a third-party reassuring Charlotte that she [i.e. Charlotte] has John's constant devotion: Page had recorded the song in a February 17, 1965 session at Columbia Recording Studio in Nashville. Despite the song's being bested for the Academy Award by \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" from Mary Poppins, a recording of Page's rendition of \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" was rush-released to become the singer's first Top 40 hit on Columbia Records as of the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated May 22, 1965; rising as high as #8 on the Hot 100 dated June 26, 1965, \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" ranked as Page's first Top Twenty hit since 1958 and earned her a fifteenth and final Gold record for sales of one million units. The track also reached number two on the Easy Listening chart. Page's producer Bob Johnston so impressed Columbia Records by facilitating Page's scoring a major hit that Johnston was given the plum assignment of producing the Highway 61 Revisited album by Bob Dylan. Page would not subsequently place a single in the Top 40. \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" served as the title cut for Page's May 1965 album release which consisted of songs with a folk song influence. Lyricist Mack David produced a recording of \\"Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte\\" by Hoyt Axton while a cover version of \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" was cut by Bruce Forsyth to compete with the June 1965 UK release of the Patti Page single: neither the Forsyth single - which featured the Mike Sammes Singers - nor that by Page reached the UK charts. Richard Chamberlain's rendition of \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" appeared on his September 1965 album release Joy in the Morning which consisted of songs from films or stage musicals: \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" also was featured on the 1965 album Chris Connor Sings Gentle Bossa Nova. The Bette Davis version of \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" was first released on the 1976 album Miss Bette Davis. The instrumental version of the movie's theme - as \\"Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte\\" - was featured on the 1965 album release Theme From Peyton Place And 11 Other Great Themes by the Frank DeVol Orchestra and was issued as the B-side of that album's single \\"Theme from Peyton Place\\".

She first started taking music lessons from the famous singer Ustad Khwaja Ghulam Mustafa Warsi. It was this music teacher who gave her this professional name due to her small size and young age. Subsequently, she studied in the school of music for three years, and thereafter, she launched her career. Her parents migrated from India to East Pakistan in the early 1950s. East Pakistan later became independent Bangladesh. She studied in BAF Shaheen School, Dhaka; however, she moved to Karachi, West Pakistan before graduating from high school, due to Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. Career Munni Begum began her career as a singer in Karachi, Pakistan in the 1970s. She released her first album of ghazals in 1976. Then she sang many more hit ghazals and thus became a renowned ghazal singer of Pakistan. In her news media interviews, she always was quick-witted and bold. Even though Urdu language was not her mother tongue, she showed a remarkable talent for choosing ghazals with simple language. This was very effective and became one of the reasons of her popularity among common people. The other reasons for her popularity were that she had a voice characterized by its clarity and strength. In the 1980s, Munni Begum's rise coincided with the rapid growth of a then new technology, the cassette tape. Cassette tape prices were cheap compared to the old technology of vinyl records. On top of that, Munni Begum had a rich voice with many shades. She also was a good harmonium player. Personal life Munni Begum was married in the 1980s which resulted in a divorce in 1998.

Assembly of the Little Mermaid statue (Copenhagen, Langeline, 1913). The statue was commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg, who had been fascinated by a ballet about the fairytale in Copenhagen's Royal Theatre and asked the ballerina, Ellen Price, to model for the statue. The sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the bronze statue, which was unveiled on August 23, 1913. The statue's head was modelled after Price, but as the ballerina did not agree to model in the nude, the sculptor's wife, Eline Eriksen, was used for the body. The Copenhagen City Council arranged to move the statue to Shanghai at the Danish Pavilion for the duration of the Expo 2010 (May to October), the first time it had been moved officially from its perch since it was installed almost a century earlier. While the statue was away in Shanghai an authorised copy was displayed on a rock in the lake in Copenhagen's nearby Tivoli Gardens. Copenhagen officials have considered moving the statue several meters out into the harbour to discourage vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it, but as of May 2014 the statue remains on dry land at the water side at Langelinie. =Vandalism= Police technicians examine the damage to the statue after being blasted off its base on September 10, 2003. This statue has been damaged and defaced many times since the mid-1960s for various reasons, but has been restored each time. On April 24, 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the Situationist movement, amongst them Jørgen Nash. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and placed on the statue.

Although not regarded as vandalism since no damage is done to the statue, people have also repeatedly dressed it, either for fun or to make more serious statements. In 2004, the statue was draped in a burqa in a protest against Turkey's application to join the European Union.

The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions that were being triangularized. The division's 201st Infantry Brigade was formerly the 75th Infantry Brigade of the 37th Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 146th Infantry Regiment. The 45th Infantry Regiment came from the 2nd Infantry Division and the 59th Infantry Regiment came from the 41st Infantry Division.

It crossed the Dnestr in June 1915, participated in the battles on the Galician and Russian Poland border, and advanced to the Bug by August. The division was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign. It reached Priština in late November and advanced to the Greek border in December. For most of 1916, and into 1917, the division remained on the Macedonian front. It underwent several changes, losing units to other divisions and receiving various replacements, and in July 1917, the division was dissolved as a tactical headquarters, with its subunits sent to other units. Its headquarters remained as a division staff for special purposes, administering Bulgarian units, until it was dissolved.

Early years Born in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, Kraus was a 1965 graduate of St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended Dartmouth College for a semester and then Ohio State University from which he graduated with a bachelor's and master's degrees in history. He went on to become an aide to U.S. Representatives Phillip and Sala Burton. Political career and AIDS activist Kraus moved to San Francisco in 1970 where he learned to practice politics from the Castro camera store owner and later City Supervisor Harvey Milk, who was among the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. After Milk's assassination in 1978, he helped Harry Britt to be elected as Milk's successor on the City Council. Kraus later became president of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club. Kraus accepted a job as liaison to the gay community for US Congressman Phillip Burton and, after Burton's death in 1983, to his widow Sala Burton who was elected to succeed her husband. Together, they worked on legislation to authorize funding to fight the AIDS epidemic. Through the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, Kraus conducted a \\"safe sex\\" campaign, attempting to bring awareness to the gay community of the dangers of unsafe sexual practices. Part of his campaign was to urge the closing of San Francisco's gay bathhouses, a recommendation that was severely criticized by some in the city's gay community who called Kraus a \\"sexual Nazi\\" for viewing the bathhouses as a problem. Kraus was himself diagnosed with the disease in October 1984. He traveled to Paris to be treated with the drug HPA-23, believed at the time to boost the immune systems of AIDS patients. In Kraus' case, it proved useless. He was in Paris when actor Rock Hudson arrived to pursue the same treatment. When it became clear the drug had failed, Kraus returned home to San Francisco where he died on January 11, 1986, at the age of 38. Media Kraus appears in the 1984 documentary film The Times of Harvey Milk. He was also a central figure in Randy Shilts' book And the Band Played On in 1987. In 1993, the book was later adapted into an HBO film, with Ian McKellen playing Kraus. The film dramatized, with some artistic license, both the book and real events in the life of Bill Kraus.

Since 1 July 2009, it has been part of the town Kelbra. Tilleda is located at the northern rim of the Kyffhäuser mountain range with the Kyffhäuser Monument, located in neighbouring Thuringia. The population is about 900. Tilleda is notable mainly for having been the site of a medieval Royal palace or Pfalz which has been partially excavated and reconstructed. History Tilleda / Kyffhäuser, ca. 1820 In around 700 a small settlement was founded on the Pfingstberg. The settlement was first mentioned in the early 9th century as Dullide, an estate of Hersfeld Abbey. The 972 marriage certificate of Emperor Otto II denotes a Kaiserpfalz (imperial palace) at Tilleda. Otto gave the Pfalz as a gift to his bride, Theophanu. Between that year and 1042, the palace was used on and off by the German kings and emperors. However, the period between 1042 and 1174, during which Emperor Frederick I \\"Barbarossa\\" stayed there, it is not mentioned in documents at all. In 1194, his son, Henry VI made peace with his former enemy Heinrich der Löwe (Henry the Lion) at Tilleda. This is the last time a king is documented to have been there. By the first half of the 13th century, Tilleda is now assumed not to have served as a Pfalzany more. The area was then ruled by the Counts of the , and a knight from their retinue, called \\"Bart von Tilleda\\", lived at Tilleda, holding it as a fief from the Emperor. In 1420, the was awarded the fief. Around 30 years later, the property was referred to as a common fief held by the House of Stolberg and the House of Schwarzburg. With the castle gradually falling into ruin, it was forgotten until the 19th century, when it was \\"discovered\\" by local historian Karl Meyer. Excavations were conducted in 1935-39 and 1958-79\\\\. From 1983 the area was made accessible to the public as an open-air museum, which reopened in its current form in 2001.

This can include rights advocates, artists, authors, etc. In spite of considerable de jure legal protection for the LGBT community in Colombia (see LGBT rights in Colombia), LGBT individuals are often subject to controversy regarding acceptance (transgender individuals, in particular). Statistics There are no complete statistical studies on the number of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in Colombia. In August 2020, questions about sexual orientation and gender identity were included in the National Poll on Consumption of Psychoactive Substances (Encuesta Nacional de Consumo de Sustancias Psicoactivas, or ENCSPA). Because of the privacy level of this particular poll (it was given to randomly selected households and filled out by only one person in the household), it was considered a good opportunity for questions about LGBT identity. The results were that 98.78% of respondents identified as heterosexual, while the remaining 1.22% were gay, lesbian, bisexual, or other. Additionally, 51.86% identified as women and 48.07% as men, while the remaining 0.05% were transgender and 0.02% were other. A spokesperson for the human rights organization Dejusticia said these numbers appear very low compared to studies in other countries and may be skewed by the respondents' fear of discrimination.

History  In January 1962, Sisters of the Good Samaritan founded a secondary school for thirty-eight Catholic girls at Narrabeen. In 1964 the college moved to Forest Road at Warriewood. The school's immediate priority was to educate the girls in a peaceful environment. By 1979, the local population growth and demand led to the decision to expand and establish the college as co-educational. In 1984, students sat for the Higher School Certificate for the first time at the College. The majority of these students had been the pioneers of co-education at the college in 1979 and had become the founding members of the new senior school. Over the next decades, new facilities were built concurrent with developments in curriculum and increasing enrolment. Contributions from the Commonwealth and the five feeder parishes financed five new buildings that were opened in the period from 1974 to 1990 and the Sisters donated the land to the College in perpetuity in 1980. In 1990 the first Lay Principal was appointed. During the 1990s significant changes were made in management, pastoral care and the curriculum. In 2002, the Bush \`bush' Chapel was closed and decommissioned in preparation for the largest integral expansion at the College.

Justice Sullivan was nominated to be Chief Justice by Gov. Rowland in 2000 and was appointed to the Connecticut Supreme Court in 2001. Justice Sullivan took senior status on April 15, 2006 and continued to serve as a Senior Justice until 2009, when he attained the age of 70. Justice Sullivan is a much-decorated veteran, serving in the Vietnam War and attaining the rank of captain in the United States Army. During his service he was awarded the Air Medal and various campaign ribbons and received two Bronze Stars for merit. The court became embroiled in a lengthy ethics scandal in 2006 when it was revealed that retiring Chief Justice Sullivan postponed the publication of a controversial decision opposing Freedom of Information Act requests for documents that track the status and history of legal cases in the Connecticut legal system until hearings for his nominated successor Justice Peter T. Zarella were completed. Legislators speculated that Sullivan delayed the publication of the court's opinion because he feared it might damage Zarella's chances of becoming Chief Justice. Both justices ruled in favor of the restrictions. Governor M. Jodi Rell accepted the withdrawal of Zarella's nomination to be Chief Justice. After Sullivan's actions were reported, Sullivan was referred to the Judicial Review Council, which suspended him for violating judicial ethics rules. This suspension is being appealed. During a judiciary committee hearing in which Sullivan was questioned, he apologized for his actions.

It is manufactured in the Bavarian town of Ostheim vor der Rhön by the Peter beer brewery. Sales started in 1995 and Bionade is now available in most European countries. Until 2018 Bionade GmbH was a subsidiary of Radeberger, a group of breweries which is a division of Dr. Oetker. Now Bionade is part of the Hassia Group. History Dieter Leipold was the master brewer at Privatbrauerei Peter in Ostheim, a small town in northern Bavaria, and a relation by marriage of the Kowalsky family, owners of the brewery. Worried about the future of the company, which was facing bankruptcy, he had the idea of producing a nonalcoholic drink by fermentation, on the same principles and under the same purity laws as German beer: the drink would consist only of the natural ingredients malt, water, sugar, and fruit essences, and would not contain corn syrup or other artificial additives. He experimented for eight years in a bathroom laboratory, spending €1.5 million of the brewery owner Peter Kowalsky's money. He isolated a strain of bacteria capable of converting the sugar that normally becomes alcohol into nonalcoholic gluconic acid, which he used to ferment the new drink. Bionade went on sale in 1995, at first in health resorts and fitness centres. It was picked up by Hamburg's largest beverage distributor, Göttsche, in 1998, but was not reaching a broad public. In 1999 Kowalsky hired the marketing expert Wolfgang Blum. Blum devised a new marketing strategy for Bionade. A retro blue, white, and red logo was designed. The bottle was made out of clear glass (instead of brown) but its form was based on a classical vitreous longneck beer format. This eased the logistics of distributing the drink and also helped to sell Bionade in bars and nightclubs, as a non-alcoholic drink that looked like a beer. The product was branded as a new trendy drink. As the company could not afford advertising on television or in the print media, they first placed it in bars and restaurants in Hamburg which were frequented by marketers and advertisers. Further viral marketing attempts included sponsoring sporting, cultural and children's events throughout Germany. By 2002-03 two million bottles of the drink were sold. A wave of health awareness was sweeping Germany: for example, 75% of all Germans approved a ban on smoking in bars. Sales reached seven million in 2004, twenty million in 2005, seventy million in 2006, when 73 million bottles were sold, and by 2007 total sales had reached 200 million.Beverage Spectrum Magazine, September–October 2007, page 72. In 2004, Coca-Cola offered to buy the rights to the drink and the Bionade brand, but the producer rejected the offer, citing its plans to expand internationally on its own. By 2006 it was available in Switzerland, Austria and the Benelux countries, and it has since reached Scandinavia, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. In 2007 the company planned expansion into the US. In 2007, Bionade started its first advertising campaign, using the slogan \\"Bionade. Das offizielle Getränk einer besseren Welt\\" (\\"Bionade. The official beverage of a better world\\"). This appealed to some of the protesters against the 33rd G8 summit, which was taking place at the time in Heiligendamm, Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania, and led to the stereotype that anti-globalisation activists always drink the beverage. The campaign encompassed billboards in fifteen German cities and radio commercials. In 2007 plastic bottles were introduced and Bionade appeared in McDonald's cafés. However, sales declined in 2008 and further declined after an increase in prices, to 60 million bottles in 2011. The Kowalsky family sold part ownership to Schindel-Holding and then to Radeberger, who became sole owners in 2012 until 2018. Since 2018 Bionade is part of the Hassia Group (Hassia Gruppe).  Metaphorical use  In 2007 German journalist Henning Sußebach coined Bionade-Biedermeier a German neologism combining Bionade, and the word Biedermeier, an era in middle Europe between 1815 and 1848. He used it to describe the lifestyle in Berlins Prenzlauer Berg district in an article published by Die Zeit. The term is a German equivalent of e.g. LOHAS and Bobo (bourgeois bohémiens) and gained some media attention and expanded use since. The underlying allusion is being used as well in related wordings like Bionade-Bourgeoisie, Biohème and Generation Biedermeier. Henning Sußebach described the Prenzlauer Berg (Prenzelberg) as an experimental field of \\"New Germany\\" and Biotop of the rich and creative and young urban professionals. As e.g. in Social Consciousness in the Bionade- Biedermeier, the term has been used to describe current films and social tendencies in Germany. Product Leipold refuses to divulge the exact chemical process he used. According to him, the gluconic acid strengthens the taste of the sugar, so that less is needed. After fermentation, natural flavours--elderberry, lychee, orange-ginger, quince or herbs--are added along with carbonation. All flavours of Bionade contain water, sugar, malt from barley (2%), carbon acid, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. The herbal and lychee flavoured versions also contain natural aromas. The elderberry flavoured version additionally contains concentrated elderberry juice and natural aromas, and the orange-ginger flavoured bottles contain extract of ginger and natural aroma. The sugar, barley, and elderberries are organic.Ingredient declaration on Bionade bottles in the Netherlands, July 2008. Organic certificate: DE-001_Öko-Kontrolstelle The manufacturer emphasises that Bionade tastes like a soft drink, but is healthier than conventional high-sugar soft drinks. They support the claim of healthiness by referring to the relatively low level of sugar, sodium and flavor-enhancing additives, the absence of phosphorus or a stabilising agent, while both calcium and magnesium are present. The website makes more health claims and suggests that calcium is needed for bones and teeth, for nerves and muscles, while magnesium is said to work against listlessness and fatigue.

He was a first-class Rugby Union player,a bravé and successful soldier and an eminent senior cleric.'What did you do in the Great War,Bishop?'by Tom Scherb,Stand To!,number 99,Western Front Association. Hudson was the sixth son of the Reverend Thomas Hudson and his wife Alethea Matheson. He was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, where his father had been headmaster. His maternal grandmother, Alethea Hayter, was the sister of Henry Heylyn Hayter (an Australian statist) and Harrison Hayter (an engineer) who married Charles Matheson of the Clergy Orphan School where his father had also taught. Hudson went on to Christ's College Cambridge where he was Tancred Student. In 1914, on the outbreak of World War I, he joined the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Personally,Hudson had an outstanding War record but it was marred by grief since two of his brothers were killed and another wounded. He would end the War having been awarded a DSO and Bar and a MC and Bar and being twice Mentioned in Despatches;he was wounded in 15 places and was an acting brigadier even though he was only 24.The exploits of the Hudson brothers are described in 'Royal Berkshire Regiment 'by FL Petre and 'Their Duty Done' by Colin Fox et al (University of Reading,1998). There are citations for all four DSO and MC awards,and his first DSO is a graphic example of the bravery he displayed. 'For consistent gallantry and able leadership,particularly on 8 August 1918,south of Morlancourt,when he personally led his battalion forward to the attack through heavy fog and intense shell and machine gun fire. When they were held up by machine guns he pushed forward alone, knocking out one of the machine guns and getting wounded in doing so. In spite of this, he rushed two other machine guns which were holding up the advance, and continued to lead his battalion forward until he was again seriously wounded by machine-gun fire in three places. He showed splendid courage and determination.'London Gazette,3 October 1919 By 1914,Hudson had already shown considerable promise as a RU running standoff half and Centre threequarter. He played for Harlequins and Cambridge University and seems to have narrowly missed a Blue. In 1919,having recovered from war wounds, he was captain of Harlequins but again failed to gain a coveted Blue despite appearing regularly in the XV. He would later play for Headingley and Yorkshire.Hudson's RU skills were referred to in Reports in The Times in the autumns of 1913,1919 and 1920 At the end of the war, Hudson went to Westcott House, Cambridge,then to Leeds Clergy School, and in 1921 began his ordained ministry in the parish of Christ Church, Leeds. In 1922 he became vicar of the same parish. After four years in Leeds he was appointed to St John the Baptist's Newcastle upon Tyne. There he distinguished himself in setting a pattern of one paramount,uniting Parish Eucharist for the whole family every Sunday morning instead of five separate services and in social work including converting decaying flats into decent accommodation with modest rents for poor families.'Bishop Henry de Candole 1895-1971'by Peter Jagger,Faith Press,1975,contains many references to Hudson,particularly of his time in Newcastle In 1931, at the age of 39, he became Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak for seven years. The diocese covered an area as large as the UK,but travelling was tortuous,by launch,canoe and on foot along jungle paths in tropical heat. Hudson's main task was to unite the work of the Mission Stations in the diocese at which he had some success'Noel Baring Hudson. A Memoir' by Malcolm Nicholson,Northern Press,1970. Accessed at West Sussex Record Office In 1938 he was recalled to become secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Archbishop Lang told Hudson that he regarded this post as Chief of Staff to the Anglian Communion. In 1940,Hudson was sent to the US to receive a donation from the American Episcopal Church which eventually amounted to $300,000 to support overseas dioceses. He had,for a short time during the Great War,Kermit Roosevelt MC as a liaison officer,and the Roosevelt connection facilitated introductions and a lecture tour.op cit Fox. There are notes by one of Hudson's nephew's on the copy in the West Sussex Record Office In 1939 he had become an honorary canon and an assistant bishop in the Diocese of St Albans and was also Select Preacher in Cambridge. On 2 October 1941 he was nominated and on 19 October confirmed as Bishop of Newcastle where he remained for nearly 16 years. He was a greatly-admired Bishop and continued a Newcastle tradition as 'one of the happiest places for a priest to work'.'The Church of England 1900-1965' by Roger Lloyd,SCM Press,1966. In Hudson's time there as Bishop,young men were attracted to starting careers in the diocese. John Ramsbotham was later Bishop of Wakefield,Hugh Montefiore became Bishop of Birmingham and Robert Runcie was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1979. Hudson 'saw his episcopate primarily in terms of the care and leadership of the clergy. It was the job of the parish priest to care for his own people'op cit Nicholson On 18 January 1957 he became Bishop of Ely until 1963. Hudson's translation to Ely was an example of a misfiring appointments process in which the Prime Minister and his patronage secretary had the key role. Archbishop Fisher had recommended Hudson as his first preference for the vacancies at Peterborough and Lincoln in 1956,apparently knowing that,for some reason,the PM would not select Hudson,probably on the advice of the outgoing secretary. So it had turned out and others were appointed. However,there was a change of patronage secretary and the new officeholder assumed that Fisher's support for Hudson's preferment was unqualified. The new patronage secretary had discovered disharmony in Ely between the cathedral and the late bishop and concluded that a commander-in- chief figure was needed to resolve the problems. Hudson seemed ideal and the PM approved the recommendation. Fisher could hardly object and was left simply working out a future modus operandi with the new patronage secretary.Op cit Scherb. The full story is in High and Mitred by Bernard Palmer,p249,SPCK,1992 Fisher's reservations about Hudson proved to be accurate. Extremely shy by nature,'he sought to hide this fact behind a boisterous bonhomie which was sometimes misunderstood ''I Was Glad. Memoirs of Christopher Campling',A and C Black This was worsened by the return of pain from war wounds and increasing deafness. Hudson soldiered on for five years and then retired. His last years were spent in a flat in Maida Vale and he died in 1970. He had very distinguished RU,military and episcopal careers,the only blemish being at Ely. Hudson's sister, Elizabeth Hudson, married Frederick Gordon-Lennox, 9th Duke of Richmond.

It is traditionally black, but models in other colors and styles are available. It is an iconic symbol of kitchens in pop culture. The first clock was designed by Earl Arnault (1904-1971) in 1932 and made by the Allied Manufacturing Company in Portland, Oregon. Allied subsequently moved to Seattle, Washington in the early 1940s and then to southern California in 1962, whereupon it was renamed California Clock Company. The clock's design has changed little in the intervening years, with the first generation, manufactured from the 1930s–early 1950s having two paws and no bow tie, and newer models having four paws and a bow tie. In the 1960s genuine crystals were added as accents to some clocks. The words \\"Kit-Cat\\" were added to the clock's face in 1982. The original clocks were AC-powered, but due to scarcity of American-made AC motors, the clock was redesigned for battery power in the late 1980s. The manufacturer estimates that an average of one clock has been sold every three minutes for the last 50 years. Kit-Cat Klocks are frequently seen in movies, commercials, TV and advertising. Several other animated clocks made by the California Clock Company, an owl and a poodle, are shown next to Kit-Cat in this sequence. The name \\"Kit-Cat\\" is a trademark of California Clock Company.

It is an ephemeral annual that grows from 5 to 10 cm tall but can grow larger at 20–30 cm tall in damp forest or scrub habitat. The few ovate leaves produced by this plant form basal rosettes around the stem. The leaves are around 3–5 mm long on short petioles. The scapes are 2–30 cm tall and produce single flowers in smaller plants and up to nine flowers in larger, more robust plants. Flowers are pink or white with red spots or lines at the individual petal bases. The petals are vertically paired and will fold over to meet each other at night or in adverse weather conditions. S. calcaratum is endemic to Australia and has a distribution that ranges from Victoria through South Australia and into Western Australia. Its habitat is recorded as being wet flats or near creeks and seepages. Pollination is achieved by a grey fly, Comptosia cuneata.Darnowski, D.W. (2002). Triggerplants.

Perth: Paterson Brokensha Pty. Ltd.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The same species was described as Stylidium androsaceum in John Lindley's 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony and again as Stylidium lindleyanum in 1845 by Otto Wilhelm Sonder, both of which were later reduced to synonymy with this current and older name. One variety of this species was described by Rica Erickson and Jim Willis in 1956. Stylidium calcaratum var. ecorne was described as a variety on the basis of the absence of a nectary spur and the fact that they produced pure colonies. The variety was later elevated to the species level as S. ecorne by P.G. Farrell and Sydney Herbert James in 1979.

Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 205th Infantry Brigade was formerly the 44th Infantry Brigade of the 22nd Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 32nd Infantry Regiment. The 71st Infantry Regiment came from the 38th Infantry Division and the 116th Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 25th Reserve Division. The 32nd and 71st Infantry Regiments were Thuringian units, raised in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, the Principality of Schwarzburg- Sondershausen, and Prussian Thuringia (part of the Prussian Province of Saxony). The 116th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Combat chronicle The 103rd Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. It was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign. It advanced to the Greek border and remained on the Macedonian front until April 1916. The division was then sent to the Western Front, entering the line in the Champagne region. From June to July 1916, it fought in the Battle of Verdun. In October and November, it fought in the Battle of the Somme, after which it returned to the trenchlines in the Champagne region and by Verdun. In May 1917, the division fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne (and by the Germans, the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne). Afterwards, it was in the trenchlines in the Chemin des Dames region and later near St. Quentin and on the Oise River. In April 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Battle of St. Quentin or the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle), and in the Third Battle of the Aisne. It later fought in the Second Battle of the Marne and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The division remained in the line until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as a good division in 1917 but as third class in 1918.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 584-588.

Practitioners of quilt art create it based on their experiences, imagery, and ideas rather than traditional patterns. Shaw's work is the most complete published study of quilt art. The book, 10 inches by 14 inches, includes 308 illustrations, most of them full page spreads of individual works of art. An excerpt from the book can be found at Quilt art generally has more in common with the fine arts than it does with traditional quilting. This art is generally either wall hung or mounted as sculpture, though exceptions exist. Early US and British contributors to the field Because of feminism and the new craft movements of the 1960s and 1970s, quilting techniques, traditionally used by women, became prominent in the making of fine arts. Dr. Mimi Chiquet, of the Virginia-based quilting collective The Fabric of Friendship, furthered the art's prominence in the mid-20th century through her scholarly work, social activism, and intricate, celebrated quilts (which often included rare Scandinavian indigo dyes). The transition from traditional quilting through art quilts to quilted art was rapid; many of the most important advances in the field came in the 1970s and 1980s. \\"Child's Quilt\\" - a Jean Ray Laury design. Made by Carol Simpelaar, NY, 1970, cottons, dimensions: 37\\" x 47\\". Collection of Bill Volckening, Portland, Oregon. Jean Ray Laury (1928–2011) is cited by Robert Shaw as the \\"most prominent and influential of [the] early modern [American] quiltmakers.\\" Laury was an \\"academically trained artist and designer who encouraged women to create their own new designs based on their own experiences, surroundings and ideas rather than traditional patterns.\\" Laury wrote, \\"There are no rules in stitchery – no single 'right' way of working.\\" Pauline Burbidge, a British artist, first saw old quilts in Portobello Road in London and 30 years later is still working in the medium. (McMorris p. 48) Radka Donnell (1928–2013), as a former painter, used her training in her quilted works. Donnell was a feminist who eschewed the \\"art scene\\" in order to explore quilts as liberating creativity for women. As recently as 1996 she was still teaching in the field with a course on the history, theory, and techniques of quilting at Simmons College and Westfield State College in Massachusetts. Charles and Rubynelle Counts, after studying at Berea College and elsewhere, started a crafts center. Charles Counts designed tops which were then quilted by local artisans. Rising Fawn, the crafts center, continued to produce quilts into the mid-1970s; the designs are little known today but are still distinctive. (Shaw, p. 49–50) Joan Lintault produced original textile and quilted art before quilting or quilt art became a national pastime. She and Therese May, as well as the Counts, had work that was first published by Jean Ray Laury in Quilts and Coverlets: A Contemporary Approach, 1970. While Lintault often makes openwork tops, May is known for her embellished and painted quilts, using private symbols and figures. Beth Gutcheon and Michael James were quilting instructors, beginning a trend which still allows quilting artists to earn income from a pursuit close to their art. Gutcheon published The Perfect Patchwork Primer in 1973. James' book, The Quiltmaker's Handbook: a Guide to Design and Construction (1978) was more technical. These two books are often cited as the place where contemporary quilt artists began. James' follow-up book, published in 1981 (The Second Quiltmaker's Handbook: Creative Approaches to Contemporary Quilt Design), showed his work as well as photos and analyses of art by Nancy Halpern, Beth Gutcheon, Radka Donnell, Nancy Crow, Francoise Barnes, and Katie Pasquini, among others. (Shaw, p. 54) By 2010 Gutcheon had established herself as a successful novelist based in New York City. James currently serves as Professor and Chair of the Department of Textiles, Merchandising & Fashion Design at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln, the academic home of the International Quilt Study Center & Museum, located in Quilt House. Quilt House view, Robert A. M. Stern Associates Architects James teaches courses in textile design and quilt studies, and continues his studio practice focused on non-traditional quilts incorporating digitally developed and digitally printed fabrics. Nancy Crow, another influential teacher and writer of books, was instrumental in freeing quilting artists from certain preconceptions about rules. Her 1995 exhibit, Improvisational Quilts, was the first solo exhibition of art quilts done by the Renwick Gallery. (Shaw, p. 66) Two other quilt artists, Molly Upton (1953–1977) and Susan Hoffman, exhibited with Radka Donnell in 1975 at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University. Also in 1975, Upton and Hoffman exhibited at the Kornblee Gallery on 57th Street in New York City. In doing so, they brought quilt art to the forefront as comparable to other forms of contemporary art. According to Robert Shaw, \\"Where other quilters were moving away from the traditional quilt one step at a time, seeing how far they could push the quilt format while still remaining connected to historical precedent, Hoffman and Upton largely ignored the rules and the assumed limitations of traditional quilting and simply leapt forward.\\" (Shaw, p. 60) Other quilt artists working in the 1970s include Terrie Hancock Mangat, Gayle Fraas and Duncan Slade, Nancy Clearwater Herman, Jan Myers- Newbury, Pamela Studstill, Joan Schultz, Yvonne Porcella, Ruth McDowell, Katherine Westphal and Rise Nagin. (McMorris, Shaw) The Quilters Hall of Fame (QHF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to honoring those who have made outstanding contributions to the world of quilting and quilted art. Many of the quilt artists discussed here appear in their list of honorees. The organization's list of honorees can be found on its website; early in their history, they had many honorees; now it appears that they generally honor only one and sometimes no quilt artists for their list.  Important early exhibits in the U.S.  Although many quilts made and displayed prior to the 1970s can now be defined as art, the form was most importantly recognized as legitimate art in the 1971 Whitney exhibit, Abstract Design in American quilts. That exhibit of pieced quilts from the 19th and early 20th centuries, organized by Jonathan Holstein, presented the quilts on stark white walls with simple gallery labels. Holstein organized the exhibit so that each piece could \\"be seen both as an isolated object and as part of a balanced flow of objects.\\" This type of visual presentation marked a break from the traditional crowded hanging of quilts in county fairs and guild shows that had predominated throughout earlier displays. The exhibit was widely reviewed, including a glowing report by the New York Times art critic, Hilton Kramer. The presentation of pieced quilts, with their emphasis on color and geometric forms, fit perfectly into the art modes of the time. The abstract expressionists, like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, who used large swaths of color on canvas, had had their moment in the 1950s. They were followed in the 1960s by such hard edge abstractionists as Frank Stella. Thus the public had already been prepared for highly colored abstract art work; the pieced quilts in the Whitney exhibit fit into the current art scene. The Whitney's pieced art exhibit toured the country and was followed by a quilt craze, which reached a culmination in the Bicentennial events of 1976. Many quilts were made for that event and a revival of interest in quilting techniques and materials started giving artists expanded work potential. In addition the feminist movement of the late 60s and 70s produced a new interest in women who worked in the arts as well as formerly neglected women's work that could now be seen as art. Quilts, exhibited in galleries and museums, fit into the country's cultural and social concerns. Other exhibits in the 1970s presented the \\"new type of quilt, one markedly different from its tradition-inspired counterparts.\\" \\"The Art Quilt\\" was a traveling exhibit, sponsored by the Art Museum Association of America, debuting at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery on October 1, 1986. Two other exhibits were \\"The New American Quilt\\" at The Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City in 1976 and \\"Quilt National\\" in 1979, the first of the still existing biennial exhibits spotlighting contemporary, generally original, designs. It too is a traveling exhibit. Other important exhibits of the 1970s include \\"Bed and Board\\", DeCordova Museum (a museum of twentieth-century American art), Lincoln, Massachusetts, 1975; \\"Quilts for 76\\", the Boston Center for the Arts, 1975; and \\"Quilted Tapestries,\\" Kornblee Gallery, New York City, 1975. Many annual venues now exist in which quilt art is exhibited; these include the International Quilt Festival in Houston, Texas, and elsewhere, and Quilt Visions, in Oceanside, California. Art quilts are now part of collections in museums such as the: * New England Quilt Museum, Lowell, Massachusetts * Museum of Arts and Design, New York, New York * Missoula Museum of the Arts, Missoula, Montana * Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California * High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia * Muse ArtColle, Sergines, France * Museum of the State of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania * Renwick Gallery of the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. * International Quilt Study Center & Museum, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska Quilt art exhibit installation view, International Quilt Study Center & Museum, University of Nebraska - Lincoln * Racine Art Museum, Racine, Wisconsin * The Mint Museum of Craft & Design, Charlotte, North Carolina * The Newark Museum, Newark, New Jersey * Museum of Nebraska Art, Kearney, Nebraska * The Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum, Golden, Colorado * The Brigham City Museum of Art & History, Brigham City, Utah * The Fuller Craft Museum, Brockton, Massachusetts * The Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, Indiana * National Quilt Museum, Paducah, Kentucky * David Owsley Museum of Art, Ball State University Muncie, Indiana * Shelburne Museum, Shelburne, Vermont * Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania * Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, Maryland Quilted art outside the U.S. has flourished in the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and possibly elsewhere. More information about the art in these countries needs added to this site. Professional organizations The professional organization for quilt artists in the U.S. and elsewhere is Studio Art Quilt Associates, founded in 1989. SAQA's membership overlaps with other professional organizations, such as the Surface Design Association and the International Machine Quilter. Major exhibitions involving only quilt art are at Quilt National in Athens, Ohio, at Visions Art Museum (Quilt Visions), in San Diego California, and at The National Quilt Museum in Paducah, Kentucky. Art using quilting techniques are appropriate for all fine art venues. Many mixed media and collage art exhibitions are especially appropriate. Making quilt art A quilted work of art is generally defined as two layers of cloth held together by stitching. In most cases, a middle batting layer made of polyester, cotton, wool or silk is also incorporated. Although quilt art originated in traditional quilting techniques, quilt artists now may use many different processes to create their artwork, including painting, dyeing, stamping, piecing, collage, printing (often incorporating a photograph printed onto fabric), applique, and other complex cloth processes.  Controversies in quilt art in the U.S.  In a field that straddles craft and art, the controversies can arise rather quickly. Jonathan Holstein recounts being accosted by traditional quilters who were confused by the quilts in the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibit, \\"which represented everything the traditional rules of the craft told them to avoid: sloppy work and assembly, bizarre color combinations, nasty materials.... Quilt makers had kept the craft alive and in a relatively pure state, the latter largely because no czars of culture had bothered to look closely at it....They made beautifully crafted quilts....The issue was hot for a long time, until enough exhibitions with orientations similar to the Whitney's had been seen across the country, and a constituency for new visual considerations in quilts had emerged.\\" Holstein, p. 57\\\\. Holstein was also criticized for divorcing the quilts from their historical context, for applying a traditional male-dominated sense of aesthetic value to a woman's art, for dismissing applique quilts as artistically inferior to pieced examples, and for his apparent lack of concern as a collector for the stories of the women who made the quilts, \\"thereby marginalizing the makers by denying them their personal identities.\\" Shaw, p 54 Some of these controversies continue to the present day. Lorre M Weidlich, in the Spring 1996 (vol. 6, #9) Newsletter of the Studio Art Quilt Associates, uses Carol Gilligan's theory of the differences between male and female values to reject Michael James's call for stronger art in the quilt art world. She says that \\"the male, Jamesian model of 'quilt art' violates the very qualities that initially attracted women to quilting and reinforce their continuing pursuit of it. It feel[s], to a great many of them, alien. The imposition of a male model on a women's expressive form leaves in a position of discomfort the very people who are the life blood of the expressive form.\\" Weidlich p 9.Michael James' remarks, to which Weidlich was responding, were given as a keynote address to the American Quilters Society Quilt Show and Contest Awards Banquet and subsequently published as \\"Quilt Art at Century's End,\\" American Quilter, Vol VII, #3 (Fall, 1992) pp. 52-74. Weidlich argues that quilts emphasize relationship and connection, and that James would remove those association to conform to male standards of the artist as idiosyncratic and subversive. Other observers of the evolution of the quilt art medium point to the long time participation of quilt making by men. The Weidlich argument could be interpreted more against elite art attitudes and less about gender appropriation. In one of the forward essays to \\"Man Made Quilts: Civil War to the Present\\" an exhibition at the Shelburne Museum in 2012, Joe Cunningham points out, \\"In the centuries before the American Revolution, quilting was a technique learned as a part of the tailor's craft in England. The best known tailor/quilter is Joe Hedley(1750-1826) of Northumberland.....\\" Cunningham goes on to cite many more examples of male quilt making from the past up to the present. Jean Burks essay also lists multiple examples of men creating quilts and states, \\"No discussion of male contributions to quilting would be complete without mentioning the considerable achievements of psychiatrist William Rush Dunton (1868-1966). Dr Dunton, the founder of the American Occupational Therapy Association, encouraged his patients to pursue quilting as a curative activity/therapeutic diversion....\\" Another controversy involves the work and people in the isolated Alabama hamlet of Gee's Bend. In the early 21st century, the Gee's Bend quilters, \\"discovered\\" by folk art collectors Bill and Matt Arnett, became celebrated as artists and toured the U.S. widely, carrying their \\"piece quilts\\" to innumerable communities where they gave talks about their lives and work. Coffee table books showed the work and lives of the Gee's Bend artists; items used domestically began to appear, bearing their designs. A lawsuit arose over whether the women's work was legally obtained and licensed by the Arnetts, who apparently sold the rights to the design for use in home dec designs. U.S. District Judge Callie Granade of Mobile dismissed the suits.Johnson, Bob (08-25-2008). \\"Suits brought by rural Alabama quilters resolved\\", Associated Press Most of these controversies have become muted as the fine arts have opened up to a vast variety of materials and methods. The materials and structures assembled by quilt artists have gone beyond or negated many of the older connotations of the quilt. Nevertheless, many questions and concerns remain and are hotly debated.  Contemporary quilt artists  Most quilt artists work in the area of the fine arts, specifically the visual arts. Their works are not generally functional in nature, although there are exceptions. The primary professional English- speaking organization of artists using quilting materials and techniques is the Studio Art Quilt Associates (SAQA), the members of which all count themselves as fine artists. SAQA has almost 3000 members . A number of contemporary fine artists employ quilting techniques in their work. In the Fall, 2010 issue of the \\"Surface Design Association Journal\\", Michael James names the following as contemporary fine artists working with quilting techniques: Michael Cummings, Ursula Rauch, Ai Kijima, Lynn Setterington, Dorothy Caldwell, Diana Harrison, Tracey Emin, Velda Newman, Clare Plug, Anna Von Mertens, Linda MacDonald, M.Joan Lintault, Susan Shie, Terrie Mangat, and Jo Budd. There are some artists that are not using quilting techniques of hand sewing, machine sewing or long arm for example, but who the quilting 'world' have taken an interest. Artists like Fraser Smith, who carves 'quilts' out of wood that look like actual quilts. Ian Berry who uses only denim to create his works, but uses glue, not quilting has shown extensively in the Fine Art world.

He played seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1943 to 1949 for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Philadelphia Athletics, and Cleveland Indians. In 355 career games, Peck recorded a batting average of .279 and accumulated 15 home runs and 112 runs batted in (RBI). Born in Big Bend, Wisconsin, Peck began to play professional baseball in 1938. He spent two years in the lower minor leagues, then spent the better part of five years with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. In 1942, Peck lost two toes in a shooting accident, but despite the injury was able to continue playing baseball. He made his major league debut in 1943 with the Brooklyn Dodgers, then joined the Philadelphia Athletics 1944. He spent three seasons with them, and was an everyday player in 1945. Peck was then traded to the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. He achieved a career high in games played with 114 in 1947, and spent 1948 and 1949 as a pinch hitter. Peck also played a game in the 1948 World Series for the Indians. After being traded from the Indians after the 1949 season, he retired from baseball, and died in 1995. Early life and minor leagues Peck was born in Big Bend, Wisconsin and graduated from Big Bend High School. As a youth, he participated the Land O' Lakes League, a Wisconsin-based amateur baseball league, and took part in statewide baseball tournaments. In 1937, Peck's father-in-law arranged for a tryout with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. The Brewers signed Peck, and sent him to play for the Hopkinsville Hoppers of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League in 1938, where he finished the season with a .331 batting average and 16 triples in 130 games. In 1939, Peck was promoted to the Bloomington Bloomers of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, where he hit .286 in 69 games. He then joined Milwaukee for the 1940 season, and became recognized as a top prospect by Major League Baseball teams. Bill Veeck, the owner of the Brewers, identified Peck as his favorite player. In one game during the 1940 season against the Columbus Red Birds, Peck chased down a fly ball and ran into an iron fence, knocking himself out. He managed to hold onto the ball in spite of this, and the catch was noted by sportswriter Harry Grayson as \\"one of the greatest catches even seen in Columbus.\\" Peck finished the season with a .294 batting average and 14 triples in 136 games, and followed that up in 1942 with a .267 batting average in 144 games. After hitting .333 in 1942, multiple teams were looking to acquire Peck from the Brewers, which included the Chicago White Sox. The Brewers were near a deal with the White Sox when Peck's season abruptly ended. On September 3, Peck lost two toes from his left foot due to a shooting accident. He was attempting to shoot rats on his farm when he tripped over a vine, shooting his foot in the process. This cost him his third and fourth toes on his right foot, and ended the White Sox attempt to purchase Peck. Shortly after the accident, the Brooklyn Dodgers purchased Peck from the Brewers and gave him a brief trial in 1943, appearing in one game for the team on May 13. After the appearance, he was returned to Milwaukee. Once he returned to Milwaukee, he had a special shoe made for him by a local shoemaker, which allowed him to play without as much pain. However, he missed the majority of the season recovering from his foot injury, only playing in 23 games, as it had not yet healed from the offseason and required further surgery. Peck returned to the Brewers in the 1944 season, and was now able to play every day. He recorded a .345 batting average with 18 stolen bases, and at one point in the season had an average of .398. MLB career The Philadelphia Athletics purchased Peck from the Brewers on August 17, 1944 for four players and $20,000. After playing in two games in 1944, Peck entered the 1945 Philadelphia Athletics season as the team's everyday right fielder after winning the job in spring training. In the first week of the season, he hit .367 and led the Athletics to six wins in their first eight games, which raised expectations of the team for the season. The Athletics finished the season with 52 wins, and Peck ended his 112 games played with a .276 batting average and nine triples. During the offseason, he worked in the dairy business with his father-in-law. In 1946, he wanted a $2,500 raise despite admitting he had not played well the prior year, and was denied; he ended up signing with the team at the end of March, missing most of spring training as a result. Peck remained the starting right fielder through the first part of the season, hitting .247 in 48 games. On June 19, the Athletics sold Peck to the New York Yankees. Despite the purchase, Peck never played a game for the Yankees. He returned to Wisconsin after fighting a bout of influenza, and did not recover fully by the end of the season. On December 6, the Cleveland Indians acquired Peck, Gene Bearden, and Al Gettel from the Yankees in exchange for Sherm Lollar and Ray Mack, which paired Indians owner Bill Veeck with the player he once called his favorite prospect. Peck was named the starting right fielder for 1947, and held that position throughout the season. Near the start of the season, from April 22 to May 11, he hit in 13 straight games. In a game against the Chicago White Sox on May 30, Peck hit two home runs and had five RBIs during the first game of a doubleheader to give Cleveland the 8–4 win. In 114 games for the Indians, the highest of his career, he finished the season with a .293 batting average, eight home runs, and 44 RBIs. Peck entered the 1948 season in a crowded battle for the right field position with the acquisitions of Allie Clark and Thurman Tucker during the offseason. Larry Doby won the starting job to start the season, and with the other two new Indians also seeing regular playing time, Peck was relegated to pinch hitting duty. In 45 games, Peck had a .286 batting average in 63 at bats. He also appeared in Game 5 of the 1948 World Series to replace Walt Judnich in right field, his only appearance during the Indians' World Series victory. With the acquisition of Bob Kennedy during the 1948 season, Peck was further relegated to pinch-hitting duty for the 1949 season, only seeing playing time to replace a pitcher at bat. He also had a nagging knee injury that caused him trouble when he was inactive, and as a result he was removed from the active roster in May. After he recovered in July, he was originally planned to be sent to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, but he was placed back on the Indians' main roster for the rest of the season. Peck finished the season with a .310 batting average in 29 at bats over 33 games, and his last MLB appearance was on September 25. Later life After the 1949 season ended, Peck was traded to the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League. However, Peck refused to report to the team, wanting to play closer to Wisconsin instead of on the west coast. The two sides did not reach an agreement, and Peck retired soon after. After retirement, Peck lived in Wisconsin for a time with his family, working for Atlantic Richfield Company, then moved to Arizona. He died at age 77 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The journey had started from Bodega Bay a little more than five years earlier on 10 July 2007. The modes of transport included a rowboat to cross the oceans, a sea kayak for shorelines, a bicycle on the roads and hiking on trails, along with canoes for a few river crossings. The route he followed was long, crossed the equator twice and all lines of longitude, and passed over twelve pairs of antipodal points, meeting all the requirements for a true circumnavigation of the globe. Guinness World Records has officially recognized Eruç for the \\"First solo circumnavigation of the globe using human power\\" on a journey that lasted 5 years 11 days 12 hours and 22 minutes, the current world record time for a solo human-powered circumnavigation. Eruç's human-powered circumnavigation plan was expanded to include summitting the tallest mountains on six continents as a tribute to his friend and fellow adventurer Göran Kropp who died in 2002 while climbing with Eruç in Vantage, Washington. Eruç named his expedition the Six Summits Project. So far he has summitted three of the peaks including Denali (also known as Mount McKinley) in North America on 29 May 2003 more than four years before he began his solo circumnavigation, then Mount Kosciuszko in Australia on 10 April 2010, and Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa on 14 June 2011 during the circumnavigation. Eruç still plans to climb the remaining three mountains on future journeys: Mount Everest in Asia, Mount Elbrus in Europe and Aconcagua in South America. By the end of his circumnavigation, Eruç had set several ocean rowing world records including the first person to row three oceans, the first rower to cross the Indian Ocean from Australia to mainland Africa (in two segments), the longest distance rowed across the Indian Ocean, and the longest distance rowed across the Atlantic Ocean. A documentary film called Castaway With Purpose will feature Eruç's circumnavigation. The film has been in production since 2013 with no release date set. Early life Mount Erciyes in the Cappadocia region of Turkey Eruç was born in Nicosia, Cyprus on 14 July 1961 and raised in Turkey. He has been an avid outdoorsman from an early age. When he was 11, his father took him for a climbing trip to Mount Erciyes, an extinct stratovolcano in south central Turkey and the highest mountain in central Anatolia with a summit at . During his higher education years, Eruç studied mechanical engineering at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul where he earned both a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science degree. In 1986, he moved to the United States where he continued his studies in engineering and business administration, earning a second Master of Science degree in Engineering Mechanics at Ohio State University and an MBA degree at George Mason University. When his schooling was complete, Eruç worked in various technical consulting projects in the U.S. for nine years, advancing into project management. At the age of 41 he left the corporate office world, allowing him all the time he needed to pursue a dream of far-flung outdoor adventures. His new occupation was educating and inspiring others, especially children, through the pursuit of entirely human-powered travels around the world. During his journey to Alaska to climb Mount McKinley in June 2003, Eruç married Nancy Board in a native Alaskan Haida-Tsimshian ceremony on a beach near Homer, Alaska, though the culture is foreign to both of them as Eruç is a Turkish Muslim while Board is an American Catholic. Board is also an outdoor enthusiast and the acting Vice President of the Around-n-Over nonprofit organization. Nonprofit organization A great circle drawn on a sphere. All other circles drawn around a sphere will have a smaller circumference than a great circle. An arc (green line) drawn directly between any two points r1 and r2 on the surface of a sphere is part of a great circle that is formed by extending the arc completely around the sphere. In December 2002, Eruç established a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization called Around-n-Over based in Seattle which received IRS approval as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity late in 2003. The Around-n-Over organization has the following mission statement: \\"All for Education and Inspiration... To accomplish, to inspire and to teach... We are in the business of realizing dreams, and helping others achieve theirs.\\" The organization was also formed to honor fellow adventurers who had lost their lives, especially Göran Kropp who fell and died while climbing with Eruç in September 2002. Additionally, Around-n-Over provides the necessary structure for handling funds for expedition expenses and charitable donations to other organizations. The Turkish İLKYAR Foundation is one such charity, which provides assistance to Turkish elementary and middle school children in rural parts of the country with a special emphasis on trying to keep girls in school. The Mateves Secondary School near Mount Kilimanjaro is also being assisted by funds donated to Around-n-Over. The organization's name is based on Eruç's plan of circumnavigating (going around an approximate great circle of) the Earth using only his own power and (-n-) also summitting (going over) the highest peaks on each of the continents, excepting only Antarctica. Eruç serves as the President and Chief Exploration Officer of Around-n-Over. The rowboat A common rowboat is much smaller and less durable than those used for rowing across oceans. In September 2004, Eruç committed to purchasing a used and proven by oceangoing plywood rowboat, the same vessel which he would eventually row across three oceans to reach two more summits in his Six Summits Project. The rowboat was christened Kaos by its first owners and was later renamed Calderdale – the Yorkshire Challenger, or simply the Calderdale, by its second owners. Before Eruç acquired it, the Calderdale had already successfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean twice with two-person teams aboard. The boat is listed as the Around-n-Over on the website of Guinness World Records. Eruç has not officially renamed the boat and still refers to it as the Calderdale. He has stated that the naming rights to the rowboat are available to a willing sponsor. The bare and loaded rowboat was equipped with many advanced navigational, safety and communications systems as well as a pair of 12 volt gel batteries charged by a solar panel that powered them all. The loaded rowboat contained an Argos tracking beacon, an EPIRB distress beacon, satellite phone, GPS navigator, radar transponder, radar reflector, VHF radio, palm-size computer, one manually operated and two powered desalination units, a medical kit, a watertight cabin and a life raft with an emergency bag of supplies. When not in active use, the rowboat has been housed at the Foss Waterway Seaport's Working Waterfront Maritime Museum in Tacoma, Washington. Initial journeys Prior to his successful circumnavigation of 2007 to 2012, Eruç had developed a substantially different route plan. This initial plan still began with his roundtrip bicycle ride from Seattle to Mount McKinley in Alaska from 1 February to 24 August 2003 with the summit being reached on 29 May. Eruç had planned to row south from Seattle to South America to continue the project with a climb of Aconcagua. On 3 October 2004, however, Eruç once again left Seattle riding his fully loaded bicycle and arrived in Miami on 25 December. He had selected Miami as a new and potentially better starting point for a circumnavigation attempt combined with the summits project. The plan at that time was to row from Miami through the Caribbean Sea and then the Panama Canal to the Pacific, row down the west coast of South America, bike to and climb Aconcagua, row to New Guinea, bike to and climb Carstensz Pyramid (an alternate to Kosciuszko for the highest peak in Oceania), row to the Asian mainland, bike to and climb Everest, row to Africa, bike to and climb Kilimanjaro, row to the Middle East, bike to and climb Elbrus, and finally row the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean back to Miami. A change in plans occurred when Eruç learned about Tim Harvey, a fellow human-powered adventurer, and Harvey's desire for a way home to Vancouver, Canada from Europe. Eruç contacted Harvey and had the Calderdale shipped to Portugal. The two men began rowing from Lisbon on 16 October 2005 intending to cross the entire Atlantic Ocean together; however, conditions prevented them from rowing away from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria after their arrival on 11 December. Harvey decided to go ahead with another group travelling by sailboat, thereby ending the human-powered part of his expedition but remaining emission-free since no motor was used. By late 2005, Eruç had considered making the entire journey a two-person rowing circumnavigation and consequently had started sending out requests for new rowing partners and sponsors. He eventually continued on alone and completed his first solo Atlantic row starting from Las Palmas on 29 January and finishing in Guadeloupe on 5 May 2006. The idea of a circumnavigation by rowboat was nearly abandoned when sponsorships and partners failed to materialize. Early in 2007, however, the Aktaş Group, a Turkish transportation and construction holding company, came forward as a principal sponsor and a new solo circumnavigation plan was set in motion. First solo human-powered circumnavigation Map of Bodega Bay, California In early May 2007, Eruç once again departed Seattle this time riding his bicycle to Tiburon, California on the north side of San Francisco Bay. After fighting very strong onshore winds while trying to row out of San Francisco Bay in early and mid-June, he departed instead from Bodega Bay, California on 10 July 2007. Eruç had bicycled from Tiburon to Bodega Bay while his rowboat was transported separately to the new starting point, as it was during all later segments of the journey. The intended destination for his first arrival port was Mooloolaba, which is located just north of Brisbane in Australia, after crossing the immensity of the Pacific Ocean. Eruç calculated that the straight-line distance was while rowing in the middle of the ocean, based on distances from his boat to both shores. Due to opposing winds and ocean currents during rest periods, the actual distance rowed would be longer. =Pacific Ocean to Papua New Guinea= The rowboat proved very capable in rough seas and was only capsized once in crossing three oceans. On 20 December 2007 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a large rogue wave tipped the boat about 120 to 150 degrees in the estimation of Eruç. The wave hit while he was asleep in the cabin and threw him to the ceiling and then back to the floor as the boat righted itself due to its ballast. The only losses of any value from the open deck were energy gels and fluid replacement packets, with all other valuables being either tied down or stowed securely. An Argos beacon On 10 January 2008, an emergency signal was received from Eruç's Argos tracking beacon. A search and rescue operation was almost started when a call from Eruç was received indicating it was a false alarm. Unusually strong currents in the middle and western Pacific made progress south very difficult for Eruç. After his launch from Bodega Bay, La Niña conditions had developed on the Pacific. He was ultimately unable to cross the equator on his first attempt due to the opposing currents and wind patterns in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Running dangerously low on food supplies after fighting strong La Niña winds from the southeast in the early part of the main typhoon season, Eruç was effectively trapped in the northern hemisphere. He accepted assistance from Filipino fishermen of the Frabelle Fishing Corporation north of Papua New Guinea (PNG) on 17 May 2008. The first typhoon of that season had formed on 5 May due northwest of him and would turn into a Category-4 super typhoon named Rammasun. He had reached the PNG waters near Ninigo Islands before the winds carried him offshore. Eight months later on 15 January 2009, after the typhoon season had ended, the same fishermen returned him to the exact location where they had found him. Continuing on the Bismarck Sea, Eruç crossed the equator and reached Finsch Harbor in PNG on 4 February. At this point, he took another break of nearly eight months to mend his injured back. Beginning on 22 September 2009 he continued on foot and by sea kayak along the Solomon Sea shores of PNG and then walked shore-to-shore from Oro Bay to Port Moresby over the historic Kokoda Track until 26 November 2009. =Australia and Mount Kosciuszko= Mount Kosciuszko Departing from Port Moresby on 8 December 2009, Eruç rowed his boatwhich had been shipped around PNG for himacross the Coral Sea and reached the Cape York Peninsula, Australia on 10 January 2010. He sea kayaked down the coast from 28 January to 15 February 2010 until he reached Cooktown where he continued by bicycle on 18 February. Eruç bicycled along the east coast toward Mount Kosciuszko, the second peak of his Six Summits Project, which he summitted on 10 April. He continued again by bicycle along the southern and western coastal areas of the country. After preparing and resupplying his rowboat in Perth through that June, Eruç had the rowboat shipped north to Carnarvon as a more favorable departure point. He bicycled to Carnarvon and arrived on 7 July 2010. =Indian Ocean, Africa and Mount Kilimanjaro= Eruç departed from Carnarvon on 13 July 2010 to cross the Indian Ocean to Africa. After three and a half months of solitary rowing, a frigate named TCG Gaziantep of the Turkish Navy rendezvoused with Eruç north of Madagascar on 30 October. Coincidentally, the frigate was named after the Turkish city where Eruç's mother had been raised, though she was born in nearby Kilis. After exchanging pleasantries and gifts via a small zodiac boat, the frigate continued escorting Eruç as he rowed westward until sunset that day. The area was being patrolled as part of a Combined Task Force to combat piracy and the commander of that task force, Rear Admiral Sinan Ertuğrul, was on the frigate. Ertuğrul and Eruç had been exchanging emails about his route and expected landfall in Africa, and were attempting to steer him clear of pirate activity. In November 2010 as the cyclone season was starting, Eruç found that he could not continue toward the African coast because a mesoscale eddy, or vortex, had formed around him and was pushing him away from the coast. He witnessed waterspouts while rowing in the Mozambique Channel and changed direction to the south-southeast reaching Mahajanga in Madagascar on 26 November without encountering any pirates. The row from Australia to Madagascar had taken about four and a half months. Eruç took a four-month break until the cyclone season ended before rowing westward to the African coast from Mahajanga on 26 March 2011 making landfall at Angoche in Mozambique on 20 April. Mount Kilimanjaro Eruç began bicycling across the continent twelve days later on 2 May with a side excursion to prepare for and climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the third peak of his Six Summits Project, from 8 to 15 June 2011. His climbing party of more than a dozen people, including his wife and his 78-year-old father Cemal Eruç, summitted the mountain on 14 June. While bicycling in northern Mozambique, Eruç had crashed his bicycle several times on an unexpectedly sandy road. On 26 June 2011, Eruç crashed over rumble strips in Kabuku, Tanzania while avoiding a passing bus. His bicycle was not damaged but his GPS unit and Argos beacon were broken, his left thumb was hyperextended, and his right hip and right forearm had hit the pavement hard. After treating the wounds and taping his swollen thumb to his forefinger, Eruç continued southwestward through Zambia and Namibia. By 21 August he had reached the west coast of Africa. His rowboat had been transported, and then prepped and resupplied during a seven- week break. He departed from Lüderitz, Namibia on 10 October 2011. =Atlantic Ocean and the Americas= The crossing of the Atlantic Ocean to South America lasted about five months until 11 March 2012 when Eruç reached Güiria, Venezuela. To reach a more favorable departure point for rowing, he completed a relatively short bicycle trip of along the coast of Venezuela to Carúpano on 19 March. His rowboat had been moved to the port of Carúpano so he could continue from there. The final rowing segment was across the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to Cameron, Louisiana in the United States from 21 March to 27 May 2012. The final segment overall was a bicycle ride starting on 21 June and ending on 21 July 2012 at the same pier where he had started, in Bodega Bay, California. The approximate route with major waypoints numbered (text annotations in the Wikimedia page) =Summary= Eruç logged while rowing across three oceansthe Pacific, Indian and Atlanticand cycling across three continentsAustralia, Africa and North America. He became the first person to solo circumnavigate the globe entirely on his own power. He crossed the equator two times, passed over twelve pairs of antipodal points and spent five years and eleven days of his life completing the endeavorthe world record time for a human-powered circumnavigation. The total elapsed time of over five years included several long periods of downtime spent away from the route, for a total of about 26 months, with Eruç always continuing again from the exact location where he had last stopped. Excluding the downtime periods, he had traveled a total of 1026 days, or about two years and ten months. The remaining three mountains of the Six Summits ProjectEverest, Elbrus and Aconcaguawere skipped during the circumnavigation primarily due to a lower level of donations than was anticipated which led to budgetary constraints and the decision to shorten the route. Eruç's decision to bypass those mountains resulted in a route that more closely followed a great circle route than the one he had originally envisioned. To finance the expedition, Eruç and his wife had sold condominium properties in Washington, D.C. and Seattle, as well as a second car, and moved into a rental property. Eruç also withdrew the funds from his 401k retirement plan. The total spent out of the couple's own assets was approximately $216,000. Their organization's sponsors and donors contributed a similar amount in cash and products, including his bicycle, bike trailer and panniers, a liferaft, desalinating watermakers, energy bars and freeze dried foods. ::\\"A half-million-dollar project is what this turned out to be.\\" Erden Eruç Eruç maintained a blog of his adventure by posting dispatches on his website every few days. He was able to communicate directly with family, friends and schoolchildren in their classrooms, as well as medical and scientific experts, via a satellite phone link with email capability. Occasional technical problems caused Eruç to record audio dispatches while in the Mozambique Channel and the Gulf of Mexico. Documentary film Castaway With Purpose is a documentary film in production since 2013 that will feature Eruç's circumnavigation. The documentary crew will travel to some of the same places Eruç passed through, filming those places along with the people he met. The crew will then combine the new film with highlights from many hours of existing video footage, still images and journal entries created by Eruç during the five-year voyage. A Kickstarter fundraising campaign was held in the summer of 2013 to help fund the film's production. The crowdsourced fundraiser ended successfully on 18 August 2013 with 286 backers pledging a total of $75,041 to the project.

It was structurally similar to the earlier Miles M.2F Hawk Major family, but had side-by-side seating for two behind the pilot in a glazed cockpit. It was powered by a de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine. The prototype, G-ACTM, built by Philips and Powis first flew at Woodley Aerodrome on 12 October 1934. The first production aircraft (designated M.3A Falcon Major) was flown in January 1935. It had a wider fuselage than the prototype to improve passenger comfort and revised glazing with a forward sloping windscreen. The M.3A was somewhat underpowered, so the (M.3B Falcon Six) and later versions were fitted with a de Havilland Gipsy Six engine. The M.3C Falcon Six was a four seater with dual controls. The M.3D was strengthened to allow an 11% increase in all up weight compared with the M.3B. The final versions were the M.3E and M.3F. An enlarged five-seat version was developed as the M.4 Merlin. Operational history The prototype was fitted with extra fuel tanks and entered into the MacRobertson Race from England to Australia in October 1934. It took 27 days to reach Darwin, but returned in a record time of 7 days 19 hours 15 minutes, including one stage of non-stop from Jodhpur to Basra.

Resistance: Fall of Man received significant critical praise, much of which focused on its multiplayer content. From November 2007 to July 2009, he was the Creative Director at Bionic Games working on Spyborgs, an action game for the Nintendo Wii. According to a post on his blog on November 13, 2009, he was employed by Activision in their Central Design group to design several games in the Skylanders franchise. Education Stout graduated from Loyola High School of Los Angeles in 1998. He went on to Holy Names University in Oakland, California, where he earned a BA in English, with a minor in Computer Science in 2001. Career Stout got his start in the video game industry at Insomniac Games as a QA Tester on Ratchet & Clank. During that project he was promoted to Junior Designer. He continued to work on the Ratchet & Clank (series) for three years, rising to Designer and Senior Designer in the process. After his fourth Ratchet & Clank game, Stout was moved to the new Resistance project, as the Lead Multiplayer Designer. Two years later, Resistance: Fall of Man became his last title at Insomniac Games. In March 2007 Stout accepted the Lead Level Design position at Obsidian Entertainment for Aliens RPG. There he worked with Chris Avellone and several other industry veterans. Before shipping a game, however, he left to become the Creative Director of Bionic Games. Creative Director is the highest position within the field of video game design, and thus presented an important opportunity. Almost four months after Bionic Games imploded in 2009, Mike accepted a position at Activision as a Design Specialist in their Central Design group, where he helped design several very successful Skylanders games. In 2013, Mike Stout left Activision to form his own company, Interactive Axis. According to the company website, he currently offers Design Consulting services to video game developers and publishers. In December 2016, Mike Stout joined the Interactive Media department of Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, in Harrisburg PA, as the 'Game Designer in Residence'. During his time at HU, Mike will mentor students, collaborate with faculty members, work on client projects and co-teach game design courses.

It is done to remove a portion of diseased lung, such as early stage lung cancer. In addition to cancer, a lobectomy can also help to treat such things as a fungal infection, emphysema and tuberculosis. Administration The most common type of lobectomy is known as a thoracotomy. When this type of surgery is done the chest is opened up. An incision will be made on the side of the chest where the affected area of the lung is located. The incision will be in between the two ribs located in that area. The surgeon will then be able to have access to the chest cavity once the two involved ribs have been pried open. The surgeon will then be able to remove the lobe where the problem is contained. Another way a lobectomy can be performed is through a video assisted surgery. With this type the surgeon does not need to pry the two ribs open in order to get in. A few small incisions are made and surgical tools are inserted into the chest cavity. A small camera with a light will then be inserted. What the camera sees will be projected onto a screen that the surgeon can see. Once the problem area is located the small tools that were previously inserted will be utilized to perform the surgery. Once the surgery is complete, the patient will remain in the intensive care unit of the hospital for a day. They will then remain in a regular hospital room for about 4 to 7 days.  Risks As with any surgery, complications may occur. The most common problems a patient runs the risk of because of this surgery include infections, reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula. The main infection that a patient runs the risk of is pneumonia. Pneumothorax occurs when there is air trapped between the lung and the chest wall. This can lead to the patients lung collapsing. A bronchopleural fistula is when there is a tube like opening that allows air to escape. Patients undergoing pulmonary resections often present postoperative air leaks. After Once the surgery is complete, the patient will remain in the intensive care unit of the hospital for a day. They will then remain in a regular hospital room for about 4 to 7 days. After the patient returns home they usually must remain in recovery for about four to six weeks, although some patients may be able to return to work/normal activities not long after returning home from the hospital. Pain is very common amongst patients for quite some time after a lobectomy. Patients can talk to their doctors about how to manage their pain while recovery at home and doctors will prescribe pain medication to help with this. Chest tubes are left inside of the patient in order to help excess fluid drain. These will be removed by a doctor in a few days. In order for chest tubes to be removed doctors must ensure that there is no longer fluid leaking from them along with no air leaking. In addition to this, follow up appointments will be scheduled with the patients doctor. X-rays will be taken of the patient's lung to make sure everything is healing properly. Patients that have had a lobectomy with no major risks shall recover in no longer than three months.

Jerry March (In this definition, the meaning of valence is equivalent to coordination number). Often in chemical nomenclature the phrase ate is suffixed to the element in question. For example, the ate complex of a boron compound is called a borate. Thus trimethylborane and methyllithium react to form the ate compound Li+B(CH3)4−, lithium tetramethylborate(1-). This concept was introduced by Georg Wittig in 1958. Ate complexes are common for metals, including the transition metals (groups 3-11), as well as the metallic or semi-metallic elements of group 2, 12, and 13. They are also well-established for third-period or heavier elements of groups 14–18 in their higher oxidation states. Ate complexes are a counterpart to onium ions. Lewis acids form ate ions when the central atom reacts with a donor (2 e– X-type ligand), gaining one more bond and becoming a negative-charged anion. Lewis bases form onium ions when the central atom reacts with an acceptor (0 e– Z-type ligand), gaining one more bond and becoming a positive-charged cation.Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions and mechanisms, Maya Shankar Singh, 2007, Dorling Kindersley, -ate suffix The phrase -ate ion or ate ion can refer generically to many negatively charged anions. -ate compound or ate compound can refer to salts of the anions or esters of the functional groups. Chemical terms ending in -ate (and -ite) generally refer to the negatively charged anions, neutral radicals, and covalently bonded functional groups that share the same chemical formulas (with different charges). For example, the nitrate anion, ; the nitrate functional group that forms nitrate esters, – or –; and the nitrate radical or nitrogen trioxide, . Most numerous are oxyanions (oxyacids that have lost one or more protons to deprotonation) and the radicals and functional groups that share their names. The large family starts with borate, carbonate, nitrate, fluorate, aluminate, silicate, phosphate, sulfate, chlorate, titanate, vanadate, chromate, manganate, ferrate, percobaltate, germanate, arsenate, selenate, bromate, molybdate, pertechnate, perruthenate, stannate, antimonate, tellurate, iodate, perxenate, tungstate, plumbate, bismuthate. Also the partially deprotonated hydrogensulfate, hydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, etc. Also phosphonate, sulfonate, etc. Also carboxylate ions such as formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate; oxalate, etc. Also methanolate / methoxide, ethanolate / ethoxide, etc. Also cyanate, isocyanate, thiocyanate, fulminate. Sulfur oxoanions, thioacetate, thiolates. Chlorosulfate, chloroacetate, etc. A lyate ion is a generic solvent molecule that has become a negative ion by loss of one or more protons. The -ate suffix also applies to negative fluoroanions, fluorides which have gained one or more protons and twice as many electrons. Tetrafluoroborate, , is boron trifluoride, , which has gained one proton and two electrons.

It was built in 1868 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 1980. It was destroyed by arson on November 8, 2008. It was the oldest of the three remaining covered bridges in Erie County. The bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory was only 14.6 percent and its condition was deemed \\"basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action\\".  History  = Construction = The Gudgeonville Bridge was constructed around 1868 and was rebuilt in the early 1870s after a fire. The bridge is located in Girard Township and crosses Elk Creek. The bridge was built and designed by William Sherman. The foundation of the bridge is believed to be remnants of the Erie Extension Canal. The name of the bridge has been a mystery with some sources indicating that the bridge was constructed to provide access to a gudgeon factory. = Modern use and status = The bridge has been damaged from numerous small fires and has been the site of constant vandalism over the years. There were several proposals to dismantle the bridge and move it to a more secure location where it would not be vandalized. Another proposal was to build another bridge to bypass the original bridge, as it is too narrow to allow a variety of vehicles to cross it, including snowplows, fire trucks, and ambulances. The interior of the Gudgeonville Covered Bridge, July 2008 Evans' 2001 Pennsylvania's covered bridges: a complete guide described the bridge to be \\"structurally sound,\\" but its general appearance to be \\"most disappointing\\". The Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be only 14.6 percent. It found that the bridge's foundations were determined to \\"scour critical,\\" meaning that the bridge's foundations were \\"determined to be unstable for the calculated scour conditions,\\" and that the railing \\"does not meet currently acceptable standards\\". Its overall condition was deemed \\"basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action\\", with an estimated cost to improve the bridge of $107,000. = Destruction = The Gudgeonville Covered Bridge caught fire around 1:40 am local time on November 8, 2008. The blaze was determined by the Pennsylvania State Police to have been an arson. On December 17, the State Police arrested two suspects after they confessed to dousing the bridge in gasoline and setting it on fire. The suspects were also involved in several other incidents in northern Crawford County and western Erie County. In August 2009, one of the arsonists was convicted and sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison for the destruction of the bridge and for an unrelated charge. The other arsonist was sentenced to to 14 years for the fire and for a string of other crimes. The Gudgeonville Covered Bridge after the fire on November 8, 2008 The replacement bridge in May 2015. The remains of the bridge were lifted from its abutments and set in a nearby field and dismantled to allow for a temporary bridge to be built in its place on January 26. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) would not allow an exact replica of the covered bridge as it still would not be up to code. The temporary, prefabricated bridge was erected in August 2009, funded by an insurance policy held by the township. The new bridge was needed quickly as a permanent, concrete bridge would have taken three years to design and build. Without a bridge, traffic would have had to make a detour.  Bridge dimensions  The north portal of the Gudgeonville Covered Bridge, July 2008 The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in different sources using different methods, as well as the name or names cited. NBI measures bridge length between the \\"backwalls of abutments\\" or pavement grooves and the roadway width as \\"the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails\\". The NRHP form was prepared by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and PennDOT, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! width=\\"*\\" Length feet (m) ! width=\\"*\\" Width feet (m) ! width=\\"*\\" Load short tons (MT) ! width=\\"*\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"Source (Year) --     NBI (2007) --  *    NRHP (1979) --    NA  Evans (2001) --  *   NA  Zacher (1986) -- } * Listed mainspan length only  See also  * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania  Notes  :a. The National Highway Administration established the sufficiency rating, which can vary from a low of 0 to a high of 100, as a way to prioritize federal funding for bridges. The rating is calculated based on \\"structural adequacy, whether the bridge is functionally obsolete, and level of service provided to the public\\". Federal funds are available for replacement of bridges with a rating of 50 or below, while those with a rating of 80 or below qualify for rehabilitation. In 2007, Pennsylvania had 22,291 bridges over long, of which 42.9 percent were either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.

It was based on the three-seat and four-seat versions of the M.3 Falcon, but with wider fuselage and consequent increased wing span. It was a low-wing monoplane, with fixed main undercarriage in trouser fairings plus a fixed tailwheel. Construction was mainly of wood, with spruce frames and three-ply birch covering, and the wings had hydraulically operated split flaps. It was powered by a 200 hp de Havilland Gipsy Six piston engine. It was first designated M.4 Merlin, but all four examples were completed as M.4A Merlin, with fixed pitch propeller instead of the intended variable pitch unit.Brown 1970, pp. 87-88Jackson 1988, pp. 57-58Flight, 4 April 1935, pp. 351-353 Operational history On 11 May 1935, the prototype (U-8, later G-ADFE), built by Philips and Powis (Miles Aircraft), first flew at Woodley Aerodrome, piloted by F.G. Miles. A few weeks later, the Merlin was delivered to Birkett Air Service, for its air taxi and charter business based at Heston Aerodrome. Two aircraft were built, and delivered to Tata Sons Ltd for its Tata Air Lines service on the Karachi-Madras route. The fourth and final Merlin was delivered to E.

Banner of the Nations) is a village in northern Israel. Located close to the towns of Acre and Nahariya in the western Galilee region, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Asher Regional Council. In it had a population of . It was founded by European Christians as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish People after the Holocaust. Its theology emphasises the need for dialogue with Jews and also with adherents of other religions. Background In the aftermath of the slaughter of six million European Jews in the heart of Christian Europe, in the 1950s a movement sprung up of Christians who were not only profoundly shocked by this event, but also sought to give expression to a desire for a different relationship. This was to encompass the rejection of attempts to convert Jews to Christianity, and the desire for dialogue and mutual respect in place of confrontation and triumphalism. Among those thinking this way, were some who thought a concrete expression of this new approach could take the form of building a living Christian community in Israel. It would work the land and participate in the hardship of what was still a poor country under threat of war. This idea, after fund-raising and promotion among churches in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the USA, resulted in the purchase in 1960 of of land from a Druze sheikh in the Galilee. The first inhabitants moved into the village in 1963. Prominent among them was Dr. Johan Pilon, who was to be its guide and inspiration for over ten years until his death in 1975.  Name and logo  \\"Nes Ammim\\" was chosen as the Hebrew name for the new village. It is taken from the Bible, from , and means \\"Banner of the Nations\\". The pioneers from different nations saw it as their calling to show their friendship and solidarity in the Land of Israel. The Nes Ammim logo consisted of a fish outline crossing a blade of wheat. The fish is a symbol of the early Christian church that refers to Jesus. The fish is meshed with the wheat, to represent a community growing in the country. History As for every other village in Israel, the early years were characterised by hard work on the land. Simple accommodation was built, and a communal dining hall and other facilities. It was similar to a kibbutz or more exactly to a moshav shitufi, a collective settlement but where families were living with their children in their own houses. Agriculture was the main activity, and avocado orchards were planted as a long-term venture. The presence of Dutch inhabitants gave an opportunity to add another element to the project. The community could assist by bringing technical experts from the Netherlands to develop the cut-flower industry as an export crop. Glasshouses were built, which would expand over the years and be the mainstay of the community's income for many years. During the latter part of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s Nes Ammim expanded rapidly and diversified into the booming tourist trade. Numerous groups of Christian pilgrims visited the community during their visit to Galilee. A youth hostel and guesthouse were built. The population rose to 140 adults and 60 children. A lively community life ensued, and hundred of young Christians worked there for short or long periods before returning to their churches in Europe with the knowledge learned there. However, the two Palestinian intifadas hit the Christian tourist trade hard. Nes Ammim was seriously affected. To make matters worse, Israel's high-tech economy pushed up costs and made the cut- flower trade no longer viable. Retrenchment was required as debts mounted. The community has made tough decisions in order to survive. Until 2012, the ideology of the community had been Judeo-Christian dialogue in unconditional solidarity with Israel, right or wrong. This dialogue left no room for indigenous Christian Arabs, not to mention for Muslims. In 2012, the community decided to adopt a more inclusive inter-faith \\"dimension\\", and to transform its facilities into meeting place for Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel. The residential buildings are now rented out to Jewish Israelis, and attempts are made to find some Arab Israelis as well. This may not be an easy task, however, as the organization is still deeply steeped in its old tradition of unconditional support for a Jewish State of Israel: an April 2015 article in Haaretz by acclaimed journalist Amira Hass describes the acceptance procedure as one in which Arabs can only be admitted if they check their identity at the door, for instance by joining in the celebration of Jewish-Israeli patriotic holidays. Applicants are vetted by a committee consisting of four Jewish Israelis and two Dutchmen. Since Nes Ammim is owned by a private corporation, it claims exemption from the Israeli law that requires that decisions by vetting committees must be transparent and cannot be discriminatory, a law upheld in the famous Ka'adan case. Aims of the movement The movement still maintains its aims as they have been developed over the years. These are: *To develop a Christian theology that is free from anti-Judaism and that advocates a non-missionary approach to Jews *To show practical solidarity to the Jewish People by living a concrete community in Israel . *To learn about the origins of Christian faith by studying Jewish tradition. A starting point is the shocking realization: that the Nazi Holocaust directed against the Jews was facilitated by a centuries-long negative image of Jews and Judaism, promoted by numerous church leaders. *To contribute - in a modest way - to peace- making, by organizing seminars of encounter and dialogue between Israeli Jews and Arabs.

During that time, the Rolling Stones were faced with the unexpected challenge of filling the recently vacated position of second guitarist, after the abrupt departure of Mick Taylor. The track features Billy Preston on electric piano and organ (although the organ could also have been played by Ian Stewart). The Who's Pete Townshend provided backing vocals for the recording and one of saxophonist Sonny Rollins' three performances on tracks for the album appeared as well. Percussion by Ollie E.

By May 1815, the war had turned against the Neapolitans and Murat had been driven back to his original headquarters in Ancona. However, the two pursuing Austrian corps under the command of Neipperg and Bianchi had become separated by the Apennine Mountains. Neipperg's force of 15,300 had directly followed the retreating Neapolitans along the Adriatic coast, whilst Bianchi's force of 12,000 had marched on Foligno, in the centre of Italy, to cut off the line of retreat back to Naples. Murat, who now had over 30,000 men in Ancona, hoped to turn and defeat one Austrian corps before the two forces could join together. Murat decided to send his main force against Bianchi and chose an area around Tolentino, west of Ancona to give battle. He dispatched a division under Carascosa north along the Adriatic coast to hold Neipperg until Bianchi had been defeated. However, following intense manoeuvring and a few small skirmishes, the Neapolitans were in danger of becoming surrounded and retreated in an orderly fashion. This allowed Neipperg to threaten the main Neapolitan force under Joachim Murat engaged at the Battle of Tolentino. This engagement eventually resulted in a decisive victory for the Austrians, and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Casalanza on 20 May.  References  *Capt.

Jim Crockett Promotions (1987) The team originally formed on July 9, 1987, in Jim Crockett Promotions, defeating Dick Murdoch and Eddie Gilbert. They would wrestle six times together, all against Gilbert and Murdoch, winning every match but the last one, which Gilbert and Murdoch won, before disbanding. All Japan Pro Wrestling (1990-1993) The team reunited in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in 1990 and quickly became a top tag team for the next several years under the name the Miracle Violence Connection. The two quickly found success when they defeated Genichiro Tenryu and Stan Hansen to win the World Tag Team Championship on March 6, 1990. Williams and Gordy would make one successful title defense against Hansen and Dan Spivey before losing the titles to Jumbo Tsuruta and the Great Kabuki on July 19, 1990. In the fall of 1990, The Miracle Violence Connection entered the World's Strongest Tag Determination League and would win the tournament by finishing in first with 19 Points. By winning the tournament, they also won the vacated World Tag Team Championship. The team would hold the titles for four months, making two successful title defenses against Mitsuharu Misawa and Toshiaki Kawada and Jumbo Tsuruta and Akira Taue. The Connection's second title reign ended on April 18, 1991 at the Nippon Budokan to Stan Hansen and Dan Spivey. A few months later on July 6, Williams and Gordy rebounded by regaining the titles for the third time. The title reign wouldn't last, three weeks later on July 24, they lost the titles to Misawa and Kawada. Williams and Gordy entered their second Tag League in the fall of 1991 and would proceed to win the tournament for the second time by finishing in first with 21 Points. Along with the Tag Tournament the Miracle Violence Connection also won the vacated World Tag Team Titles for a fourth time. Four months later on March 4, 1992, they lost the titles to Jumbo Tsuruta and Akira Taue. For the remainder of 1992, Williams and Gordy attempted to regain the titles but failed to including a rematch with Tsuruta and Taue on October 7. The two also entered the 1992 World's Strongest Tag League but finished 2nd place with 17 Points. On January 30, 1993, The Miracle Violence Connection won their fifth and final World Tag Team Title by defeating Mitsuharu Misawa and Toshiaki Kawada. After holding the titles for 4 Months, Williams and Gordy would lose the titles to the newly formed: Holy Demon Army (Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue). After failing to win the titles on July 26, Williams and Gordy would team one last time on July 29, 1993 defeating Johnny Ace and Kendall Windham. After the match, Gordy left All Japan breaking the Miracle Violence Connection up. World Championship Wrestling (1992) In 1992, they went to World Championship Wrestling where they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating the Steiner Brothers in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 5, 1992. One week later, they won the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship by defeating Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham in a tournament final. They held onto both titles until October 3, 1992 when they lost them to Rhodes and Windham. During their relatively brief stay in WCW, they had a feud with the Steiner Brothers which, in addition to being a major WCW feud, was also seen as a major feud by Japanese fans even though the two teams never faced each other in Japan. Despite advances by New Japan, Gordy and Williams, out of loyalty to Giant Baba, refused to compete for the rival promotion. In October 1992, Gordy left WCW, before Halloween Havoc, while Williams left in December, after Starrcade. Aftermath After breaking up, Williams and Gordy briefly reappeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling in late-1996, facing The Eliminators at When Worlds Collide and High Incident. Terry Gordy died on July 16, 2001 due to a heart attack. He was 40 years old.

It was only under Augustus, however, at the end of the 1st century BC, that present north Portugal and Galicia were fully pacified and under Roman control. During the Roman occupation, the city developed as an important commercial port, primarily in the trade between Olisipo (the modern Lisbon) and Bracara Augusta (the modern Braga). As the Roman Empire declined, these regions fell under Suebi dominion, between 410 and 584. These Germanic invaders settled mainly in the areas of Braga (Bracara Augusta), Porto (Portus Cale), Lugo (Lucus Augusti) and Astorga (Asturica Augusta). Bracara Augusta, capital of Roman Gallaecia, became the capital of the Suebi. As trade collapsed, Portus Cale went into decline. Another Germanic people, the Visigoths, also invaded the Iberian Peninsula and would eventually conquer the Suebi kingdom in 584. The region around Cale became known by the Visigoths as Portucale. Portus Cale would fall under the Moorish invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711. In 868, Vímara Peres, a Christian warlord from Gallaecia and a vassal of the King of Asturias, Léon and Galicia, Alfonso III, was sent to reconquer and secure from the Moors the area from the Minho River to the Douro River, including the city of Portus Cale, and founded the First County of Portugal or Condado de Portucale. Portus Cale is thus the former name of current-day Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia's riverside area, that would be used to name the whole region and, later, the country. Origin of Portugal's name The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an ethnonym derived from the Castro people, also known as the Callaeci, Gallaeci or Gallaecia, a people who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. Cala or Cailleach was the name of a Celtic god – in Scotland she is also known as Beira, Queen of Winter – and at the time the land of a specific people was frequently named after its deity. The names Callaici and Cale are the origin of today's Gaia, Galicia, and the -gal in Portugal. The meaning of Cale or Calle is likely a derivation of the Celtic word for port which would confirm very old links to pre-Roman, Celtic languages. Compare today's Irish caladh or Scottish cala, both meaning port. The medieval Scottish historian Hector Boece thought the name Portugal was derived from Porto Gatelli, the name Gatelo gave to Braga when he settled there, while others say he gave it to Porto. Other historians have argued that Greeks were the first to settle Cale and that the name derives from the Greek word ', 'beautiful', referring to the beauty of the Douro valley. Others have hypothesized that the word Cale came from the Latin word for 'warm' (Portus Cale thus meaning 'warm port'). Portugal's name derives from the Roman name Portus Cale. Portucale evolved into Portugale during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, Portugale was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and Minho, the Minho flowing along what would become the northern border between Portugal and Galicia. The origin of the name Galiza (Calecia, Gallaecia) may be found in the root cale, which also appears in words like kallaikoí or galaicos. Many scholars believe that the origins of the name Galaicos was in the area around the mouth of the Douro river and the Romans then used this name to refer to all the Celtic-speaking Castro people of the Iberian Peninsula's north-west, an area they named Gallaecia. In today's Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the word for port is respectively caladh and cala.

Architectural photographers are usually skilled in the use of specialized techniques and cameras for producing such specialized photography. History Early architectural style photograph by William Henry Fox Talbot, c. 1845. The first permanent photograph, View from the Window at Le Gras by Nicéphore Niépce, was also the first architectural photograph as it was a view of buildings. Similarly, photographs taken by early photographer William Henry Fox Talbot were of architecture, including his photograph of a Latticed window in Lacock Abbey taken in 1835. Throughout the history of photography, architectural structures including buildings have been highly valued photographic subjects, mirroring society's appreciation for architecture and its cultural significance. By the 1860s, architectural photography started to become an established visual medium. Much as building designs changed and morphed with traditional forms, architectural photography also evolved with time. During the early-to-mid-20th century, architectural photography became more creative as photographers used diagonal lines and bold shadows in their compositions, and experimented with other innovative techniques. By the early 1950s, architects were hiring more photographers for commissioned work, resulting in architectural photography being viewed as more of an art form than what it had been considered before. Techniques Nikon 24mm perspective control lens A tenet of architectural photography is the use of perspective control, with an emphasis on vertical lines that are non-converging (parallel). This is achieved by positioning the focal plane of the camera at so that it is perpendicular to the ground, regardless of the elevation of the camera eye. This result can be achieved by the use of view cameras, tilt/shift lenses, or post-processing. Traditionally, view cameras have been used for architectural photography as they allow for the lens to be tilted or shifted relative to the film plane. This allows for control of perspective, as well as a variety of creative possibilities. In a similar fashion to landscape photography, a deep depth of field is usually employed so that both the foreground and background (to infinity) are in sharp focus. More recently, digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras have been used in the field of architectural photography. These cameras also employ detachable, tilt-shift lenses of varying (usually fixed) focal lengths. When shooting interior and exterior photography is important to shoot in a wide- angle lens. You want to use two straight walls to frame interior shots.  Exterior and interior  Architectural photography typically shows either the exterior or the interior of buildings. The techniques used in each of these types of photography are similar, but do have some difference and sometimes require different equipment depending upon the requirements. = Exterior = Example of an exterior architectural photograph Exterior architectural photography usually takes advantage of available light by day, or at night it uses ambient light from adjacent street lights, landscape lights, exterior building lights, moonlight and even twilight present in the sky in all but the darkest situations. In many cases, the landscaping surrounding a building is important to the overall composition of a photograph, and even necessary to communicate the aesthetic harmony of a building with its environment. The photographer will often include flowers, trees, fountains or statues in the foreground of a composition, taking advantage of their ability to help lead the eye into the composition and to its main subject, the building. Aerial photography is trending as it shows different and unique perspectives of the structure being photographed. This can include getting level with the structure, showing property boundaries, revealing the location in a geographical view point, and putting context to surrounding scenery. = Interior = Interior architectural photography can also be performed with ambient light transmitted through windows and skylights, as well as interior lighting fixtures. Frequently though, architectural photographers use supplemental lighting to improve the illumination within a building. Either electronic flash \\"strobes\\" or incandescent \\"hot lights\\" are generally used. A feature of architectural photography is that the principal subjects almost always remains stationary. It is therefore possible to use post-processing editing to achieve a balanced lighting scheme, even in the absence of additional lighting. Trade organizations The architectural photography as a profession is primarily represented by three trade organizations, which strive to spread best practices among architectural photographers, as well as promote the sound business practices, consistency, quality and copyright protection. * The American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP) * The Association of Independent Architectural Photographers (AIAP) * The International Association of Architectural Photographers (IAAP) * The Association of Photographers (AOP) See also * Architectural photographers * Perspective control lens * Perspective control * View camera References External links * ASMP - American Society of Media Photographers - Architectural Photographers Group * AIAP - The Association of Independent Architectural Photographers * IAAP - International Association of Architectural Photographers Photography by genre ","title":"Architectural photography"},{"id":"13268325","text":"Member of the Resistance in France during World War II, he was sentenced to death, but just deported.

Its remains have been found in the Jiufotang Formation at Chaoyang (People's Republic of China) dated to the early Aptian age, around 120 million years ago. Only one species, Yixianornis grabaui, is known at present. The specific name, grabaui, is named after American paleontologist Amadeus William Grabau, who surveyed China in the early 20th century. Description The type specimen (and only specimen found to date) of Yixianornis, catalog number IVPP V12631 in the collections of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, is one of the most well- preserved bird fossils known from the Jehol group. It is nearly complete and, unlike many other fossils, the bones are mostly uncrushed and were not split in half when the stone slabs were initially separated. It is also one of the few known Mesozoic ornithuran bird specimens that preserve clear impressions of the wing and tail feathers. Yixianornis was moderately sized compared to other yanornithiformes, at about the size of a chicken ( long excluding feathers),Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information with a wingspan of about . Yixianornis was grossly similar to its close relatives Yanornis and Songlingornis. All three had teeth, though in Yixianornis the tips of the jaws were toothless and pockmarked with small pits and grooves, possibly indicating the presence of a beak. The teeth were small and peg-like, and lacked any serrations. The lower jaw was thin and delicate. The breastbone bore a strong keel for the attachment of flight muscles, and contained a distinct opening or fenestra, a unique characteristic of yanornithiformes. The upper and lower arm were about the same length. Like other ornithurines, Yixianornis had a highly fused hand, with many wrist bones joined together that are free in more primitive birds. The hips and hind limbs preserved more primitive features than the forelimbs, supporting the idea that the modern adaptations in the locomotion seen in modern birds evolved after the many specializations needed for flight. The hallux, or reversed, perching toe of modern birds, in noticeably pointed backward in the fossil. However, there is no clear evidence that the bone itself was twisted, which would indicate that the toe was permanently reversed. Yixianornis differed from related birds only in small skeletal characteristics. For example, the teeth in the lower jaw of Yixianornis were confined to a smaller space, while they lined more of the jaw in related species. The wishbone (furcula) of Yixianornis was more narrow than in its relatives, and its shoulder blade was much shorter, only half the length of the upper arm bone (humerus). The flight feathers of Yixianornis are well preserved in the only known specimen. There were about five primary feathers on each wing, the longest measuring about . Unlike in many more basal species, the feathers did not become narrower or more pointed at the tip. Rather, the feathers were very broad and rounded. There were eight tail feathers, up to long, anchored to a pygostyle and rectrical bulb (see below) as in modern birds. Biology and ecology The feathers of Yixianornis are unique among those preserved in other Mesozoic bird specimens, and have allowed scientists to infer its probable lifestyle. The wings were broad and rounded, with similarly large, rounded feathers. The tail feathers were arranged in a graduated series, with the outer feathers anchored closer to the base of the tail. This would have given the tail a slightly rounded silhouette. Additionally, carbonized tissue impressions show that it had a rectrical bulb, the muscles around the tail which allow the tail feathers to be fanned out during flight, and retraced when at rest. These adaptations are rare among Mesozoic birds, many of which are known to have had long, pointed wings and very few, if any, long tail feathers. The rectrical bulb and plough- shaped pygostyle allowing for tail fanning is also a unique characteristic of ornithurine birds, of which Yixianornis is among the earliest known. In a 2006 study, Julia Clarke, Zhou Zhonghe and Zhang Fucheng found that the ability to fan the tail, along with the broad wings, show that it probably preferred environments with dense vegetation, where high maneuverability in flight would be necessary. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Yixianornis and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been diurnal, similar to most modern birds. Classification It was a close relative of Yanornis and together with this and Songlingornis forms a clade of early modern birds. Clarke et al. found that Yixianornis was the most primitive bird to display an essentially modern pygostyle and fan of tail feathers. Later, an enantiornithine called Shanweiniao was found to have a fan tail as well, though it may have evolved independently of modern birds.Jingmai K. O’connor, Xuri Wang, Luis M.

The film features an ensemble cast, including Heather Graham, Victor Rasuk, Dominic Chianese, Elizabeth Peña, and William Baldwin. The film earned mixed reviews upon release. The film was nominated for Best Narrative Feature at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Feature Competition. It was awarded the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2007 Indianapolis International Film Festival, the Best Director Prize at the 2007 San Diego Film Festival, and the Special Jury Ensemble Award for best cast at the 2007 Palm Beach International Film Festival. Plot The film centers on New Yorkers who are lonely and emotionally lost in the big city. Rose (Graham), an ophthalmologist, has separated from her husband (Baldwin), a school teacher, and is in deep mourning over the recent death of their two-year-old son, who accidentally fell out a window. Tomaso (Chianese) is a painter who has just learned that he's going blind. Simon (Rasuk) is a 20-year-old photo shop clerk living at home with his alcoholic mother. The three strangers live along the 1/9 subway line and two of them connect in a profound way. Simon, using borrowed cameras, becomes obsessed with Rose's scarf and begins stalking her to take her picture. When she learns what he is doing, her reaction is unexpected. Cast *Heather Graham as Rose Phipps *Victor Rasuk as Simon Colon *Dominic Chianese as Tommaso Pensara *William Baldwin as Mark Phipps *Elizabeth Peña as Isabel Parades *Erika Michels as Claire Phipps *Marlene Forte as Marta Colon *Richard Petrocelli as Mr. Sneider Production Alfredo De Villa came up with the concept of Adrift in Manhattan while flying to a festival in Havana, Cuba, to present his 2002 film Washington Heights: De Villa said that he initially wanted the film to have a \\"slow, small movement.\\" \\"The story was always going to be as big as the characters. Never bigger than them. It was a challenge to ourselves to see if we could pull it off.\\" The screenplay for Adrift in Manhattan was written by Nat Moss, who previously worked with De Villa on Washington Heights. According to De Villa: It took Moss two and a half years and numerous drafts to complete the script. The final screenplay was sent to Scott Foster, who would become the co-producer, and sent to UTA and Steve Brown, who would handle financing and became the main producer. Financing Adrift in Manhattan lasted for two years: \\"In that period, we went through a bunch—and I mean a bunch—of producers, all of whom tried their best to get it done. My agent also helped a lot. The first thing we did is we got a cast interested and attached. From there, like I said above, my producer Steve Brown got involved and magically raised the money. I say 'magically' because I honestly still don't know how he did it. He just did and we were shooting.\\" De Villa said the script was much darker in earlier drafts, but that it was toned down due to financial reasons: \\"The scenes between the mother and son were a lot more explicit, and we had to stay more at the level of hint and suggestion. What Heather's and Victor's characters did was a lot darker, as well—more than just the spanking, if you will!\\" He also said that casting took place during the writing process: \\"I always get inspired by actors and find myself writing for them. I don't necessarily mean writing for big-name actors or stars, but writing for actors I have worked in the past with or that I have seen in films and plays. That happened to me with the role of Victor Rasuk (who I loved in Raising Victor Vargas), Marlene Forte (a great actress, who I had the pleasure of working with on the stage), Richard Petrocelli (I had worked with him in my student short) and Elizabeth Peña (no words of introduction are necessary). For the rest of the roles, I was extremely open. My agent set me up with several meetings with very good actresses for the role that Heather Graham eventually did. One of them was Heather. I immediately liked her energy and had this hunch about it.\\" In Adrift in Manhattan, Graham's character Rose becomes paralyzed when she hears the death of her two- year-old son. In preparing for her role, Graham not only imagined what it would be like for the character to experience the death of her toddler but was also actually depressed due to circumstances in her own personal life. Rasuk said that when he first looked at the screenplay for his character, Simon, he wanted to make sure that \\"every scene and every moment was really real.\\" He also claimed he was affected by a man older than he who had experienced depression in his life, which helped him prepare for his role. Simon's incestuous relationship with his mother in Adrift in Manhattan was based on De Villa's complicated family history. He stated, \\"The first thing I should say is that my mother and I never had any incestuous relationship! Let’s get rid of that evil rumor before it arises! Actually I’m not that close to my mother: my father is dead, and I essentially grew up without a father. . . . It was a very conscious decision when we were thinking about that character to make him have this really complex relationship with his mother.\\" De Villa claimed the film's title was originally going to be1/9, named after the subway lines. The writers were going to set a scene where Rose pursues one of her stalkers in a subway. However, the title was changed for two reasons: when being accepted into the Sundance Film Festival, De Villa was asked to pick a more mainstream title; and they decided to change the setting and context of that scene based on a \\"cat and mouse\\" scene from the 1971 drama thriller The French Connection. Production began in February 2006, and the footage was edited by July. De Villa said the quick filming schedules were the biggest challenge of making the film. Critical reception Reviews of Adrift in Manhattan from critics were mixed, holding an aggregate of 44% on Rotten Tomatoes as of August 2014. Julia Wallace, critic for The Village Voice, wrote \\"that you can't build a movie around lingering, soulful shots of the No. 1 train zooming up and down the West Side.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film two stars out of four, writing that, despite the well-done acting and directing, it was \\"dramatically tepid.\\" Variety writer Dennis Harvey said, \\"Mild thesp marquee value and the glut of similar, often bolder exercises in recent memory make this a so-so theatrical prospect, though it should do OK in cable and DVD arenas.\\" Like Lumenick, he also praised the acting but wrote that the film didn't \\"go anywhere definite or distinctive enough to leave a lasting impression.\\" In an article for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis called it \\"an all-too-familiar wallow in urban woe and artfully photographed isolation\\" and concluded, \\"If there are eight million stories in the Naked City, some of them must be better than this.\\" Scott Weinberg of Moviefone wrote, \\"While not exactly what you'd call a bad movie, Adrift in Manhattan is simply too predictable, familiar and obvious to warrant much in the way of attention or enthusiasm.\\" An Indiewire writer named it \\"a pile of loose threads and anyone desiring dramatic finality will leave disappointed.\\" On the more positive side, /Film's Peter Sciretta said it was a \\"pleasant surprise\\" that \\"provides an interesting and intimate snapshot of the life of everyday people in New York City,\\" awarding it a seven out of ten. Emanuel Levy opined, \\"De Villa's meditation on loss, loneliness, and alienation in urban New York is downbeat, slow, studied, and a bit pretentious, but it's nicely acted by the entire cast, particularly Victor Rasuk and Dominic Chianese.\\" He also noted the film score as his favorite aspect of the movie, which, he said, \\"accentuates the melancholy and sorrowful mood of the film.\\" Kirk Honeycutt, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, said the film was \\"like a good short story, where there are no wasted moments and an economy of expression allows the story to achieve maximum impact.\\" Jamie Tipps, in his three-and-a-half- star review for Film Threat, said he liked \\"that it is not the coldness of the city that causes these characters to be alone; all around, people reach out to them.\\" Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News gave it three out of five stars and named it \\"a small film with great humanity and deserves a broader audience than it's likely to get.\\"Matthews, Jack (September 21, 2007). \\"Short Takes: More movie reviews\\".

The Geiseltalsee is found to the south-west. The A38 goes through the neighborhood. History The village of Geusa was mentioned as early as 880/890 in the Hersfeld Tithe Register (German:Hersfelder Zehntverzeichnis) as Husuw(n)a, or Husiuwa. Additional nobility maps dating back to 1000 have the town marked as Geußau, Geißau, Geusau, and Geußen. It appears as Gusau in an August 9, 975 entry in the Pago Hassaga, a record of noble land holdings for the region during the reign of Otto II. The town appears as \\"Geuse\\" in Willem Blaeu's 1645 edition of Atlas Novus in the map of Mansfeld Land entitled Mansfeldia Commitatus. Origin of name The von Geusau family of Geusa maintains that the name derives from the Latin gans for \\"goose.\\" However, while this cannot be ruled out, no salient documents exist to support this claim. It is equally probable that the name Geusa shares its origin with the Geisel River Valley, but since both names date back to the days of the Carolingian Empire, the original spelling and etymology have been lost. There are several equally valid possibilities: =Proto-Germanic origin= Due to its age, the name is likely related to the Proto-Germanic root hūsą, meaning \\"house\\" or \\"home.\\" The first documented mention of the village was in a tithing document created between 881 and 899 in Hersfeld Abbey where the place name was listed as Husuuua in the district of Friesenfeld.Reg. Thur. Nr. 287 This is likely to mean House by the meadow.Spring, Bernhard: Welche Rolle spielt die weiße Gans? In: Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, 21. Januar 2013 =Old High German origin= The name may also derive from Old High German gewi, (from the Gothic gavi, (neuter) or gaujis (genitive)), a medieval term for a region within a country, often a former or actual province.

He perhaps is best remembered as the longest serving director of the Alabama Extension Service (now known as the Alabama Cooperative Extension System) and for helping Alabama agriculture through a critical period of development. Davis also emerged as a national leader of and advocate for farming and Cooperative Extension work in the 1940s and 1950s.Yeager, Joseph and Stevenson, Gene, \\"Inside Ag Hill: The People and Events That Shaped Auburn's Agricultural History from 1872 through 1999\\", Chelsea, Michigan: Sheridan Books, 1999. pp.90-1. Early life Davis was born in a rural hamlet known as Skinhead near Athens, Alabama, on Aug. 15, 1890, to Richard Scoggins Davis and the former Mildred Elizabeth Barker. In a family genealogy written several years before his death, Davis recalled Skinhead as the place where his \\"depleted family settled after being blasted out of McMinn County, Tennessee, by the hell of the Civil War.\\" Davis, P.O., \\"My Davis Family Ancestors,\\" (Self-Published Book), Auburn University Special Collections, 1966. Davis also recalled that while this tiny community lacked intellectual and cultural sophistication, it was a place where \\"people go to church, treat their neighbors right, tend to their own business and still believe God is for the living and the dead.\\" After working for a while as a public school teacher from 1909 to 1912, Davis enrolled at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University), located in Auburn, Alabama, where he graduated in 1916. From 1916-17, he worked as a horticulturist for the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, leaving to take a job as an agriculturist with Southern Railway. He also worked briefly as an assistant boys club agent. He married the former Mildred Kilburn, of Florence, in 1918. Davis worked briefly for Progressive Farmer before returning to API in 1920 to serve as an agricultural editor for the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and the Alabama Extension Service. WAPI Shortly after assuming his new role as editor, Davis, however reluctantly, became one of the South's radio pioneers. His involvement in this emerging medium followed after Birmingham News publisher Victor Hanson offered API $2,500 to establish a radio station to provide educational information to farmers and other API audiences. Recalling the incident more than 40 years later to then-Auburn University president Ralph Brown Draughon, Davis viewed the donation as practically meaningless, because it scarcely was enough to purchase the equipment to broadcast the signal, let alone to operate the station on a daily basis. Another limiting factor was the scarce number of radio receivers available in Alabama at the time. Unfortunately for Davis, the API administration, as well as his immediate supervisor, then-Alabama Extension Director Luther Duncan, fearing the bad publicity that would follow if they refused the donation, saw things differently. Davis, as the institution's editor and publicist, was assigned the task of securing funds and personnel to operate the new station. It marked the beginning of a long, and as Davis recounted late in life, largely frustrating, association with this new medium. Simply acquiring an engineer who knew anything about radio was challenging enough. As Davis recalled, WMAV was installed on the evening of February 22, 1923. By then, the Extension Service already had spent far beyond the initial $2,500 donation. \\"We pecked and struggled as best we could with the equipment that was almost obsolete by the time it was installed,\\" he recalled.Davis, P.O., \\"Radio Station WAPI; a history as told in a letter to Dr. Ralph B. Draughon from Mr. P. O. Davis, November 25, 1961,\\" Auburn University Special Collections. Davis worked with Alabama Extension agents throughout the state to organize radio listening sessions with farmers and their families. Extension Home Demonstration Agent Thalia Bell operates a radio at the Sandy Creek-East View Club, Tallapoosa County, Feb. 4, 1926.After acquiring entirely new equipment, Davis moved the facility to Comer Hall and acquired new call letters: WAPI, which are still carried by the station today. Davis also was instrumental in working with agents to organize radio listening parties for audiences throughout the state — a practice that would foreshadow videoconferencing techniques common today. After repeated unsuccessful attempts to affiliate with a national network — NBC or CBS — Davis decided to move the station to Birmingham after securing a pledge from city officials to provide half of the annual operating costs, totaling approximately $20,000. As an additional cost-cutting measure, Davis also negotiated an arrangement with the University of Alabama and Alabama College at Montevallo (now University of Montevallo) to operate the station in partnership with API. The arrangement with Birmingham and the other two institutions worked reasonably well, Davis recalls, until the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, after which the cash-strapped city was forced to renege on the deal. This critical disruption in income forced Davis to lease the station — a \\"long and painful effort,\\" as he recalled. Even so, Davis did not find the effort entirely unsatisfying. WAPI not only provided the three institutions with a broadcast presence but also ensured a \\"nice annual return on their investments\\" from about 1922 to 1961. \\"Some day, I hope a competent historian will dig up all of the facts and write much more in detail than I have about WAPI — a comprehensive history,\\" Davis stated in the Draughon letter. \\"I believe that it would be a story well worth writing and reading if done accurately and intelligently.\\" Publicist and Executive Secretary All the while Davis served as WAPI general manager, he also carried on his duties as editor of the Extension Service and the Experiment Station. He is distinguished for building one of the nation's leading public communications programs of his era. His work as an Extension agricultural editor served as a model for Extension programs in other states for reaching farmers and other audiences through print and broadcast media. In an era when agriculture comprised a major pillar of the U.S. economy, many of Davis' staff people were in hot demand among farm-related publications, agencies and businesses. Davis was also considered a tireless Extension worker. Records show that in 1925, he traveled almost 14,000 miles by train and more than 3,300 miles by car to carry out his work. People who worked with Davis recall that he never overcame his editing proclivities even after he became Extension director, frequently correcting grammatical and syntactical lapses in reports and other documents. From 1933-36, he also wore two other professional hats, serving Alabama Extension as executive secretary and registrar. Extension Director, 1937-1959 Following predecessor Luther Duncan's ascension to the API presidency in 1937, Davis was appointed director of the Alabama Extension Service, going on to become the longest tenured director in Alabama Extension history. Davis was considered an idealist and one who was far less politically motivated than Duncan. The cerebral Davis also was criticized for not identifying closely enough with farmers — he \\"didn't have enough dirt on his shoes\\" to connect with the state's farmers, as one employee recounted years later. In the view of many, though, he was an extrovert, also blessed with considerable communicative and organizational skills — attributes which, coupled with a deep devotion to the Cooperative Extension mission, more than compensated for any shortcomings. National Farm and Extension Leader As a result of his effective Extension leadership during the late Depression and through the war years, Davis emerged as a national agricultural leader and spokesman, which enabled him to influence the course of federal legislation throughout the Roosevelt years — in the view of some, a critical asset in an era when the federal government exerted an especially strong influence on farm policy. Davis also was highly regarded as a public speaker, traveling throughout the South and through much of the nation sharing his views on the future of agriculture and Extension's evolving educational mission. Personal philosophy Like many American educators of his era, Davis firmly believed in the transformative power of scientific progress, frequently expressing effusive pride in the role Cooperative Extension had played as a change agent in mechanizing Southern farming and rendering it more efficient and profitable. \\"Together, we're engaged in the finest type of education anywhere and by any people,\\" said Davis, in an address to the Association of County Commissioners and Probate Judges in Mobile, Alabama, in 1956. \\"In brief, it is scientific and technical information for sound and practical people where they live and work.\\"Davis, P.O., \\"County Government and Extension Work,\\" An address to Association of County Commissioners and Probate Judges, Mobile, Alabama, Aug. 26, 1954. Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956. He often expressed exasperation with southern farmers who failed to heed the Cooperative Extension message, even describing the South as \\"a land of neglected opportunities\\" where producers were \\"not taking advantage of opportunities, little and big, around them and among them.\\" \\"With chagrin, I have known of southern families having to call on charity or upon government for food,\\" said Davis, writing in 1938. \\"To me, this is unthinkable except, of course, [in] emergency cases.\\" \\"Every farmer, either landlord or tenant, can have one or more fresh food products almost any day of the year, except after occasional hard freezes. These, plus canned and dried products — also meat, milk and eggs, which can be produced at home — make a good diet, and plenty of it.\\"Davis, P.O., \\"Some Neglected Opportunities,\\" Agriculture: Its Background, Its Achievements, Its Organization, Its Challenge, Its Future,\\" Extension Service, API, Auburn, Alabama. Davis was determined to step up efforts to reach farmers and their families who, for whatever reason, were not heeding the Cooperative Extension message. In an article published in the Extension Review, he stressed that Extension workers must do a \\"bigger and better job of teaching and inspiring more people into action.\\" It was not enough merely to limit the Extension message to the small handful of farmers willing to become \\"Extension disciples,\\" Davis stressed. Instead, he envisioned and implemented a strategy that would reach all rural people with the \\"very best teaching methods at our disposal and the employment of the very best Extension workers.\\" Davis undertook a major technological overhaul of Alabama Extension field offices, providing each county office with \\"an addressing machine so that both big and little mailing lists can be used for effective contact through the mails.\\" Outlying offices also were provided with film-strip and stereopticon machines \\"so that each county worker may combine vision with sound in presenting facts at meetings.\\" Davis also expanded Alabama Extension's presence in both print and broadcast media. He developed close working relationships with Alabama weekly and daily newspapers and with farm home publications. Extension educational broadcasts were aired six days a week on most broadcast outlets in Alabama. In addition, Davis oversaw the launching of \\"This Month in Rural Alabama,\\" an 8-page tabloid that ran as an insert in 97 Alabama weekly newspapers. With a publishing run of 100,000 weekly copies, it became the most widely circulated publication in Alabama.Davis, P.O., \\"We Must Reach More People: An Editorial,\\" Auburn University Special Collections, Auburn University, Alabama. Jeffersonian Davis respected the role science had played in the rapid advancement of southern agriculture, but his faith in scientific achievement and progress was qualified. From his own experience working with farmers, he knew that stunning technological advances often brought new and even more complicated challenges. One notable example was the huge improvements in cotton yields that farmers, working closely with Extension agents, had made in spite of the persistent presence of the boll weevil — an achievement that, in turn, led to a cotton surplus and the \\"attending headaches and difficulties now so prevalent.\\" The farm surpluses associated with improved cotton farming methods concerned Davis — so, for that matter, did the region's excessive reliance on the crop.Davis, P.O., \\"The Years Ahead in Home Demonstration Work,\\" Speech to the Home Demonstration Agents' Annual Meeting, Mobile, Alabama, March 2, 1956, Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956. P. O. Davis Drive, named in honor of Davis, on the Auburn University campus.Largely because of this, Davis was an early and vocal proponent of farm diversification. \\"It is plain to me that cotton, upon which we are relying very largely for money income, must have help,\\" wrote Davis in 1937. \\"It is also plain that livestock and poultry are cotton's best helpers.\\" Davis, P.O., Agriculture: Its Background, Its Achievements, Its Organization, Its Challenge, Its Future,\\" Extension Service, API, Auburn, Alabama. A lifelong Democrat who maintained a cordial working relationship with the Roosevelt Administration, Davis nonetheless feared the long-term social and cultural effects of industrialization — effects already reflected in the growing number of Americans who were working for employers rather than for themselves. \\"So, individual freedom as our ancestor knew it is largely gone because one who works for another is not exactly free in the sense that one is who finances his business and works for himself,\\" Davis stated late in his Extension career. He believed that farmers, along with small storekeepers and small businessmen, were essential to preserving freedom in America, because they were \\"part capitalist and part worker.\\" Davis, P.O., \\"Cooperatives in Alabama Agriculture,\\" Address to Alabama Cooperatives, July 21, 1951, Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956. This Jeffersonian passion for farmers and small businessmen sentiment largely account for his intense interest in and sympathy for the Farm Bureau concept. Without the cohesiveness Farm Bureaus around the country provided, farmers would be unable to withstand the onslaught of bigness in the form of both big government and big business, Davis believed.Davis, P.O., \\"Facing the Future Together,\\" Address to Alabama Farm Bureau Training School, Auburn, Alabama, July 30, 1952, Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956. Clash with Gov. James. E. \\"Big Jim\\" Folsom Davis's goal of building up Extension to reach as many rural Alabamians as possible was not without its critics. These critics included Gov. James E. \\"Big Jim\\" Folsom, who maintained that this zeal for Extension work often came at the expense of other agencies. As ex-officio chairman of the API Board of Trustees, Folsom, working closely with his ally, Gould Beech, an API trustee, filed charges at a trustees meeting February 21, 1947, claiming that Alabama agriculture had suffered a relative decline in farm income, partly because of Davis' mismanagement of Extension. Folsom also alleged that Extension failed to cooperate with other state and federal farm agencies and that it controlled the Alabama Farm Bureau, even choosing the president and delegates to Farm Bureau conventions. The governor also maintained that Extension was too politically engaged and had even used its weight to defeat an income tax amendment. Davis was eventually cleared by the trustees, who also passed a resolution commending him for his work. Retirement For a time in the 1940s, there was a tug of war between Davis and Elbert H. Norton, state school superintendent, to succeed Luther Duncan, the API president, who had died unexpectedly in 1947. Davis retired in 1959 and was succeeded by E. T. York. He spent the last few years of his life compiling a family genealogy of the Davis family and serving on several professional and charitable boards. He also served as president of the Alabama Writers Council from 1962-63. Among his honors, he was voted \\"Man of the Year\\" in Agriculture by Progressive Farmer magazine and awarded a medal and certificate from the American Farm Bureau in 1945 for distinguished service to American agriculture. He was also listed Who's Who in America for 1952-53.

The pilot episode aired on 16 September 2006 to much critical acclaim and positive reviews. The first series started on 7 September 2007 with the pilot episode being aired first and then the remaining episodes. The show was shown every Friday night at 9:30pm. In May 2008, the BBC made the decision not to renew the show for a second series. Instead Dear Green Place was renewed. Situation and plot Legit is set in and around a fictitious street market, where main characters Sammy Fox and Danny work selling illegal DVDs and pirated computer software. Fox has recently split up with his girlfriend Kelly-Ann and is trying to win her and her children back off her new boyfriend John McCann. Danny is living with his mother and Fox is currently living in their backyard in a caravan until he \\"wins her back\\". Cast * Sammy Fox (Steven McNicoll): Sammy Fox has recently split up with his girlfriend and wants her and her children back but John McCann—her new boyfriend—is standing in the way. He lives in Danny's back garden in a caravan until he can get her back. He works in the market alongside Danny. * Danny (Jordan Young): Cocky and always on the lookout for a girl, Danny still lives with his mother. He works in the market alongside Fox selling illegal DVDs and knows how to get anything he needs from there. In contrast to Sammy who is very self-conscious about his body, Danny is something of an exhibitionist. * May (Clare Grogan): Danny's mother, has a thing for Fox. * John McCann (George Drennan): The subject of Fox's jealously, he enjoys the competition between him and Fox over Kelly-Ann who is his girlfriend. He is better than Fox at almost everything, much to Fox's constant dismay. * Happy Boab (Raymond Mearns): A fellow market trader, Boab is always happy and optimistic and says \\"Happy days\\". As seen in the episode \\"Night of the Lobster\\", he is incapable even of pretending to possess any emotion other than constant happiness. He is not very bright and was abused in his childhood. Episodes # \\"Birthday\\": When Sammy's son says he wants a monkey for his birthday, Sammy goes to great lengths to obtain one, including posing for an artist and staging a fake robbery at a local zoo. # \\"Manitoba\\": Danny helps Sammy in an effort to make Kelly-Ann jealous by pairing him up with his cousin, Manitoba—a scheme which backfires spectacularly when her father and a bust of Lionel Richie become involved. # \\"Night of the Lobster\\": Danny fakes a legendary \\"lost\\" horror movie. # \\"The Old Team\\": Fox is jealous of his old friend making a successful career in comedy stand up and is angry that he has made money out of fox's history. Danny has a rival at the market. # \\"Danny, Champion of the World\\": Danny is pleased with his mother's new boyfriend (played by James Fleet) and sets out to mould him into the perfect man. Meanwhile, Locatelli (played by Hugh Ross), the artist previously seen in \\"Birthday\\", hires Fox to install a security system at his house. # \\"Removals\\": Even the simple task of emptying a deceased woman's house is too much for the hapless Fox and Danny. What starts as loading boxes into a van ends up in kidnapping, cross-dressing and considering the meaning of life. Robert Florence, the writer for the show and star of Consolevania appears in this episode. This episode has a similar set-up to Florence and Connell's subsequent sitcom, Empty.

Although Leinster had been appearing regularly in The Smart Set and pulp magazines such as Argosy and Short Stories for three years, \\"The Runaway Skyscraper\\" was his first published science fiction story (or more accurately, scientific romance, since Hugo Gernsback had yet to coin the phrase \\"science fiction\\"). Gernsback would reprint the story in the third issue of his science fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories in June 1926. Plot summary \\"The Runaway Skyscraper\\" concerns Arthur Chamberlain, an engineer who works in a midtown Manhattan office building called the Metropolitan Tower. When the sun suddenly begins moving backwards in the sky, setting rapidly in the east, he is the only one to realize what is actually happening: a flaw in the rock beneath the building has caused it to subside, but instead of moving in space, the building is falling backwards into the past. When the subsidence finally ends, the building is located several thousand years in the past, and its 2000-odd inhabitants find themselves stranded in pre-Columbian Manhattan. Chamberlain also realizes that the same seismic forces that caused the building to drop back into the past can also be used to return it to the present, but that doing so will require several weeks of intensive work by the building's inhabitants, and in the meantime they must concentrate on feeding themselves. Chamberlain convinces the president of a bank on the first floor that he can return them to the present, and together they are able to organize the other inhabitants into hunting and fishing parties. Two weeks later, Chamberlain is ready to implement his plan.

Career Shirra began riding at the Kembla Grange Speedway in New South Wales in 1973 at the age of 14 (he lied about his age in order to race as riders had to be at least 16 years old), although he would consider the Liverpool Speedway in Sydney as his home track.The Sydney Morning Herald. - 7 December 1975 Early in his career this actually led him to ride as an Australian rider, though by the late 1970s when his true age and nationality was revealed he would be considered a New Zealand rider. In 1975, Shirra joined the Coventry Bees and was loaned out to the Coatbridge Tigers for a year. From 1976-1982 he rode for Coventry then transferred to the Reading Racers. In 1987 he was loaned out to the Swindon Robins but returned to Reading in 1988–1989. In 1990 he was banned from the British League for a season for bringing the sport into disrepute after failing two drug tests. Controversy about the decision soon followed and the ban was lifted by the speedway control board. After three months, Shirra returned to racing for the remainder of the 1990 season.\\"No regret\\" interview with Steve Magro in Backtrack, issue 22 (September/October 2007) He returned to race for Reading in 1991, Swindon in 1992, the Ipswich Witches in 1993 and 1994 he was awarded best club rider that season.

In 1979 he was a member of the New Zealand team with Larry Ross, Bruce Cribb, Roger Abel and Ivan Mauger which won the World Team Cup at the White City Stadium in London. This would prove to be the only World Championship win of Shirra's career and the only time he rode in a World Team Cup Final.

He scouted locations for potential missions with Marcus Whitman among the Liksiyu and Niimíipu nations in 1835. Early life Samuel Parker was born on April 23, 1779, in Ashfield, Massachusetts, to Thankful Merchant Parker and Elisha Parker.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. He was educated on the East Coast where he graduated in 1806 from Williams College, and in 1810 from Andover Theological Seminary. Parker was ordained as a minister in 1812, and then taught and preached in New York until 1833. There he married his first wife, Miss N. Sears, and in 1815 he married a second time to Jerusha Lord, with whom he would father three children. One son’s name was Samuel J. Parker. Missionary After the famed incident involving four Flathead tribesmen asking William Clark for religious guidance, Parker answered the call for missionaries to move to the American West in 1834. In 1835, he traveled with fellow missionary Marcus Whitman. After preaching at the Green River rendezvous of the American Fur Company, Parker continued west while Whitman returned east. During the winter of 1835 to 1836, Parker was a guest at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s fur trade outpost on the Columbia River, Fort Vancouver. He was then the first Presbyterian missionary in what would become the state of Oregon . Parker would then seek out locations for the establishment of missions in the region. He traveled through the Willamette Valley and Lower Columbia Valley to select sites that were later used by the missionaries of the American Board for Foreign Missions, including what became the Waiilatpu Mission. Samuel Parker then left the region by ship, sailing first to the Sandwich Islands and then around Cape Horn to the Eastern Seaboard. Later life Parker returned to New York and informed the board of the best sites for missions. He was then rejected for missionary work for the board due to his advanced age.Long, Bill.

It was held on 1 October 1989 at the Mount Panorama Circuit just outside Bathurst, Australia. The race was held for cars eligible under International Group A touring car regulations with three engine capacity classes. The race was won by the Dick Johnson Racing Ford Sierra of Dick Johnson and John Bowe. The pair lead almost the whole of the race and was only seriously threatened by the Allan Moffat run Sierra of German drivers Klaus Niedzwiedz and Frank Biela. Third and fourth places were awarded to the official factory Nissan team entries with the Nissan Skyline of Jim Richards and Mark Skaife finishing third. The Tooheys Top Ten runoff for pole position was notable for Peter Brock discharging his Ford Sierra's engine bay Halon gas fire extinguisher which was angled across the intercooler substantially boosting the power of the engine in the crucial drive up the mountain straight. As this was not technically against the rules the scrutineers did not find any misconduct, but the Entrants Association levied a $5000 fine on Brock for a moral infringement of the rules.1989 – Johnson Goes the Distance!, www.therealmountpanorama.com, as archived at web.archive.org Class structure Cars competed in three classes The 1989 Toohey 1000 Entry List, Official Programme, Tooheys 1000, Mount Panorama – Bathurst, 1 October 1989, pages 64 & 65 defined by engine capacity. =Class 1= Class 1 (Over 2501cc) featured the turbocharged Ford Sierras, Nissan Skylines, Toyota Supras and Mitsubishi Starions, the V8 Holden Commodores and BMW 635CSis. =Class 2= Class 2 (1601 to 2500cc) comprised BMW M3s and a Nissan Gazelle. =Class 3= Class 3 (Up to 1600cc) was contested exclusively by various models of Toyota Corolla.

He is also known as Dallas Angguish, the name he used as a performance poet beginning in the 1980s. He has been repeatedly compared to Truman Capote and to David Sedaris. Angguish, who is openly gay, has also written plays and screenplays some of which have been produced. He is known for a lyrical style that foregrounds feeling and the use of powerful descriptive passages. Due to his evocative short stories, he has been variously described as Truman Capote's literary heir and as reminiscent of Carson McCullers, the much lauded Southern Gothic writer.An Angguished Moment - Qnet online community His prose poetry has appeared in the journals Text,Text: Journal of the Association of Australiasion writing Programs Lodestar Quarterly,Lodestar Quarterly - an online journal of the finest gay, lesbian, and queer literature Retort MagazineRetortMag.com  Volume 2 Issue #2 Dec 02 - Jan 03 - Poetry and Polari journal. Polari Journal - A Queer Creative Writing Journal, Issue 1 His short stories have appeared in the book anthologies \\"Dumped\\",Sarah Neal, ed, Bookman Press, Melbourne 1999 \\"Bend, Don't Shatter\\",Rachel and Costello, eds, Soft Skull Press, NY, 2004\\"Sensual Travels\\"Michael Luongo, ed, Bruno Gmunder Verlag, 2013 and others. His collection of memoir and travel writing \\"Anywhere But Here\\",Showpony Press, Brisbane, 2006 released in February 2006, received very strong reviews.An Angguished Moment - Qnet online community In particular Graeme Aitken of Australian gay magazine DNA wrote: Dallas John Baker \\"was born in Toowoomba, Queensland and this collection of stories is a mix of travel tales, memoir and fiction. The first section of the book, set in America’s Deep South, confirm [his] talent. The stories are highly atmospheric, off-beat and absorbing. Some have gay content, but not all of them. Local readers will be interested in the final section of stories, set in Australia with locales ranging from Byron Bay to the Darling Downs. It’s refreshing to read new gay-themed Australian work that isn’t set in Melbourne or Sydney.\\" The review also noted that Dallas John Baker \\"demonstrates an enviable flair for storytelling.\\" Baker published a second book of travel writing in 2011 titled 'America Divine: Travels in the Hidden South'. This book focuses on travel in the South of the US, particularly New Orleans. The book explores folk religion practices of the South including voodoo, Southern Hoodoo and snake-handling among other things. America Divine has been described as 'what you'd get if Victor Frankenstein made a new monster by splicing together body parts of David Sedaris, Truman Capote, Bruce Chatwin and just a bit of Djuna Barnes'. Another reviewer wrote that Angguish is 'an impressively skilled writer' and 'something of a strange genius'. The same reviewer later hailed Angguish as Truman Capote's literary heir. Poetic style In the eighties and nineties, under the nom de plume Dallas Angguish, Baker performed at many spoken word events in Australia garnering a reputation as one of Australia's most enigmatic, queer spoken word performers. A recording of his spoken word piece \\"The Pugilist\\", set to music by composer Luke Monsour, was played on Australia's national youth radio broadcaster Triple J. Baker's poetry is in the tradition of queer poetics initiated by Walt Whitman and consolidated by Allen Ginsberg, a tradition that foregrounds the colloquial voice, a first person, personal point of view and the expression of an erotic and mystical vision. Baker's poetry is often highly evocative and self-reflexive, as in the passage below: > I am part libertine, part priest. I have dual yearnings. On the one hand I > like solitude and introspection. I am a sky-gazer whose goals are universal. > I crave the freedom of simplicity. On the other hand I am drawn to the > communion of skin. I yearn to abandon myself, and thereby become free, in > physical delight. These two impulses have often been at odds with each > other. I struggle to find a balance.Sleep, in Dallas Angguish, Anywhere But > Here, Showpony Press, 2006. Much of Dallas John Baker's poetry, written primarily to be spoken, deals with themes of eroticism, alienation and mysticism. The excerpt below, from his poem 'Embrace', is a good example: > As I walk away from your embrace I feel the cold shadow of your pupils > falling on the small of my back where I have that tattoo which is an emblem > against you and you fire those daggers from your eyes which embed themselves > like anchors under the skin of my shoulder-blades and hook me to you with > long tethers that are desire not wanting to let go, that are thin streams of > poison, and when, in the night as I try to arm myself against you by > whispering the long and perfect names of all of my Buddhist saints, you slip > your arm under my head like a pillow and your breath comes in close to me > like a breeze which has on it all the saltiness of sex and the sea... This passage illustrates Baker's use of the Beat Generation inspired flowing stream-of-consciousness style he deployed in a series of poems that fuse the paradigms of eroticism and (Tantric Buddhist) mysticism. Baker spent five years as a Buddhist monk and is still committed to Buddhist practice.An Angguished Moment - Qnet online community Another example from his poem 'The Tempo of Shamans' makes the fusion of these twin concerns in Angguish's work explicit: > Your rap pounds on my heart like on an animal skin drum with the deep rhythm > of thunder over oceans, that are the bass clarinets of our most holy > thoughts, and each consonant that leaps from your tongue is a missile of > enticement that heat-seeks-out my longing for you and inflames it and as > your syntax evolves into ideas I feel drunk and need to close my eyes and > invoke you with my mind's eye and in that picture your rap is a ballad that > has tones like wet silk and you are a fierce troubador, who holds a hard > hand over my mouth to keep me quiet and listening, who chants with incessant > power, words that are waves of erotic assault that bring me close to that > precipice that is petit morte that is silence and the dark void, that is a > window into the true nature of things, and as the blitzkrieg of your > thumping voice hits me square in the chest I feel explosions of ecstasy that > shake my place in space and time and whir the electrons of my being into a > whizz fizz sort of a thing that is just like being a mushroom cloud of mass > destruction Scholarly Writing Dallas John Baker is also a scholar in the disciplines of editing & publishing, Creative Writing, Queer Theory and Buddhism. He has recently published papers in the scholarly journals Colloquy: Text, Theory, Critique,Colloquy: Text, Theory, Critique Issue 20 December 2010 Creative Industries Journal, Text and Postscripts.Postscripts: The Journal of Sacred Texts and Contemporary Worlds, Volume 4 Number 3 2008 These works are published under the name Dallas J.

They were the featured backup group for Barry Manilow from 1974-1979 and released one hit of their own, 1976's \\"Street Singin'\\". The tune, which was written and arranged by Manilow, reached #27 on the Billboard Hot 100 record chart. The song came from their album, Beauties In The Night which was also produced by Manilow. Originally called The Flashy Ladies, a reference to a song on Manilow's first album, the trio (with Ramona Brooks, whom Pege replaced in 1976) sang backing vocals for Manilow in live performance and on his first 7 multiple platinum albums. Their first recorded appearance was in 1975 on Soundstage. They later appeared with Manilow on his Emmy-award-winning first special and on numerous TV shows including Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, The Midnight Special, American Bandstand and Donahue. They performed with Manilow on his first European tour in 1978 with concerts at the Olympia in Paris, The Palladium and Royal Albert Hall in London, and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. Because Pege and Byrd were African-American, and Reparata, in the middle position, was Caucasian, Manilow often jokingly referred to them as \\"The Oreos\\" '' Since its inception, Debra Byrd was the vocal coach for contestants on American Idol for 11 years, later joining as coach for \\"The Voice. In addition to singing on sessions in Los Angeles, including the Oscars, she is currently the vocal chair for the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, Monica Pege sang with Barry Manilow again from 2004 to 2010 in Las Vegas at the Hilton and his Colosseum shows. Reparata Mazzola was previously a member of Reparata and the Delrons under the name Lorraine Mazzola. She changed her legal name to Reparata after losing a case against Mary O'Leary over the right to the stage name. Currently, Mazzola is a screenwriter and lives in Los Angeles.

An artificial mound, it was constructed between the years, 1934 and 1937. It is located in the western part of Kraków, on the Sowiniec Heights, Kraków's VII District \\"Zwierzyniec\\". It is the newest and largest of Kraków's four mounds. History In 1934 the Polish Legionists, and their associations, proposed to build a monument commemorating the re-establishment of Poland's independence. The Committee for Mound Construction was created in Warsaw and was chaired by Walery Sławek. Construction began on 6 August 1934, the 20th anniversary of the departure of First Cadre Company from Kraków at the beginning of World War I.E-Krakow, mounds in Krakow After the death of Marshal Józef Piłsudski on 12 May 1935, the Legionists - former subordinates of Piłsudski, the creator of the Legions - decided to change the name of the mound after their leader. The mound was completed on 9 July 1937. Soil from every World War I battlefield in which Poles fought was placed into the mound. During World War II, Hans Frank, Nazi German governor of occupied Poland, issued the order to flatten and destroy the mound, but due to the difficulty and expense it was never carried out. After the war, the communist government of Poland, which considered the mound a relic of the capitalist Second Polish Republic, still supported by the Polish government-in-exile, tried to minimize the mound's importance. Any mentions of it were removed from official publications and the surrounding area was filled with trees to help obscure the view. Unofficially it was referred to as the \\"Kopiec Sowiniec\\" (Sowiniec Mound). However, the most damage to the monument was inflicted during the Stalinist era; in 1953 the granite tablet with the Legion's cross was removed, and much of the surface area of the mound was devastated. In 1981, with the weakening of the communist government, the reconstruction of the mound was begun. Soil from World War II battlefields in which various Polish armies participated was added to the monument, and it gained a nickname of 'Grave of Graves'. In 1995, five years after the fall of communism in Poland, the first major renovation of the mound was completed. In 1997 a major flood damaged the mound, and a second renovation began soon afterwards, finalized in 2002 with a ceremony attended by the president of Poland.

In the 19th century the firm became the number one manufacturers of varnishes, paints and later printing inks in the British Empire. In the twentieth century it developed its product range in industrial coatings and inks, as well as commercial property. History of Mander Brothers Mander Brothers has its origins in businesses developed by the Mander family in the Wolverhampton of the early Industrial Revolution, where members of the family first developed trades in the manufacture of chemicals and varnishes to supply the Midland Japan trades and national markets. =18th century= In the early industrial revolution, the Mander family entered the vanguard of the expansion of Wolverhampton, on the edge of the largest manufacturing conurbation in the British Isles. The brothers Benjamin and John Mander were early industrialists and entrepreneurs, who established a cluster of loosely integrated businesses in paints, lacquers and pigments, japanning, chemicals manufacture and varnish making. =19th century= By 1820, the firm traded as Mander, Weaver & Co., already operating one of the largest chemical manufacturing works in the country, trading from the United States of America to China. They developed businesses in baking, japanning and tin-plate working, canals and gas manufacture. Benjamin Mander was chairman of the Wolverhampton Union Flour and Bread Company, a co- operative milling company set up to provide subsidised bread and flour in the period of social distress following the Napoleonic Wars. The partnership of Mander Brothers was founded by the brothers Charles Benjamin Mander and Samuel Small Mander in 1845, concentrating on varnish manufacture. As the business expanded with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of railways all over the British Empire, branches and agencies were established in \\"all the civilised countries of the world\\". The company diversified into paint and printing ink manufacturer from 1865. The family became distinguished for public service, art patronage and philanthropy. Charles Tertius Mander (1852–1929) was created the first baronet of The Mount in the baronetage of the United Kingdom in the Coronation honours of George V, on 8 July 1911. =20th century= The business was constituted as a limited company, Mander Brothers Limited, in 1924, when Sir Charles Tertius Mander was appointed the first chairman, or \\"governing director\\". Under the chairmanship of the Radical Liberal M.P., Sir Geoffrey Mander, Mander Brothers led many progressive initiatives in the field of labour relations and employment welfare between the Wars. Mander Brothers was the first British company to introduce the 40-hour week through an historic agreement signed and mediated by Ernest Bevin, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, in September 1932.'Agreement Made' The Green Can, October 1932 As in similar important TGWU negotiations in the early 1930s, such as at Imperial Chemical Industries and Crosse and Blackwell, reduced working hours coupled with increased worker efficiency was facilitated by the Bedaux Unit.M. Weatherburn, Don't Believe The Hype: Work, Robots, History (Resolution Foundation, 2017), appendix 2. Online. In the mid- twentieth century, constituted as Manders Holdings Limited, the company redeveloped their historic properties on a -acre site in the centre of Wolverhampton. In 1968–74 the company established the Mander Shopping Centre and Mander Square on the site of the early family works dating to the eighteenth century. Today the Mander Centre dominates the retail heart of the city. It was acquired by Dalancey Estates in partnership with the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2010, which led to controversy and questions in Parliament when they removed a bronze sculpture, 'Rock Form (Porthcurno)', by Barbara Hepworth, specially commissioned for the site and donated by the Mander family and shareholders in 1968. On 4 December 2014, the Mander Centre was acquired by Benson Elliot Capital Management for £59 million ahead of a £60 million reconfiguration and refurbishment, which will see the Mander Centre anchored by a 90,000 sq ft Debenhams Department store, which is due to open in 2017.https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/12/04/mander-centre-bought- for-59m/ In the 1990s, trading as Manders PLC, the various divisions of the business were sold piecemeal in a major Group restructuring in order to focus on the core activity of printing inks and specialty chemicals manufacture. First, the paints and coatings businesses were sold to the Total S.A. Group; then the property portfolio, including the Mander Centre, was sold to the Prudential Insurance Company. Manders PLC went on to acquire a number of the world's leading ink manufacturers, including a major competitor, Croda, trading with operations in the UK, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the USA. In 1994 the Netherlands-based company Premier Inks was acquired, when the major brand became Manders Premier. Manders PLC was established as one of Europe's largest manufacturers and distributors of publishing and industrial inks. In 1998, the printing inks division was sold to the Flint Ink Corporation, of Detroit in the United States of America, \\"so ending a long chapter in the British chemicals industry\\" (The Financial Times). In 2000, Manders Premier adopted the Flint Ink identity of Flint Ink Europe, headquartered in Luxembourg.

Biography A native of Cambridge, Massachusetts of Lithuanian descent, Tamulis attended The English High School, where he led the school's baseball team to the 1930 Boston city championship. While still in high school in 1929, he played for the Osterville and Hyannis teams in the Cape Cod Baseball League. Tamulis was signed by the New York Yankees as an 18-year-old, and began his professional baseball career in 1930 with the Chambersburg Young Yanks of the Blue Ridge League. He worked his way through the minor league system, and was called up by New York late in the 1934 season. Tamulis made his major league debut on September 25, getting the start on the mound for the Yankees against the Philadelphia A's at Shibe Park. The A's countered with hurler Joe Cascarella, and featured a lineup that included Baseball Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx batting cleanup. Tamulis pitched brilliantly, tossing a complete game shutout, scattering seven hits (two to Foxx), and striking out five. Yankees Hall of Fame slugger Lou Gehrig homered, and Tamulis himself singled and scored on Red Rolfe's triple. New York came away with a 5–0 win in Tamulis' only appearance of the season. Tamulis became a Yankee regular in 1935, posting a 10–5 record with a 4.09 ERA over 160.2 innings. Highlights of his 1935 season included a complete game shutout of the Cleveland Indians at Yankee Stadium on May 16, and a 10-inning complete game performance in a hard- luck 2–1 loss to the St. Louis Browns in the second game of a doubleheader in the Bronx on July 21, with Tamulis yielding the game-winning homer to Moose Solters in the 10th. Tamulis himself clouted his only major league four-bagger on June 11, a two-run homer off Browns hurler Russ Van Atta at Sportsman's Park. Tamulis had three RBI on the day, and went the distance on the mound in the Yankees' 9–3 victory. After the 1935 season, Tamulis was weakened by a prolonged bout of pleurisy, and as a result spent the 1936 and 1937 seasons with the Newark Bears of the International League. After the 1937 season, he was traded to the St. Louis Browns for Harry Davis. Tamulis appeared in only three games for the Browns early in their 1938 season, taking losses in all three appearances with a 7.63 ERA. He was claimed off waivers by the Brooklyn Dodgers, and turned his season around, posting a 12–6 record in 159.2 innings with a 3.83 ERA for the 1938 Dodgers. He appeared in 39 games for Brooklyn in 1939, and 41 games in 1940. After the 1940 season, the Dodgers traded Tamulis to the Philadelphia Phillies, who traded him back to the Dodgers after six lackluster performances early in the 1941 season. He appeared in 12 more games for the Dodgers that season, before being shipped off to the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association in July. He never made another big- league appearance. Tamulis posted an impressive 20–8 record for Nashville in 1942, and entered military service after the season. With World War II over, Tamulis returned to Nashville for the 1946 season, and in 1948 became player- manager of the Hopkinsville Hoppers of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League, posting a 17–3 record on the mound in 1948. His last playing season for the Hoppers was 1951. At Hopkinsville, Tamulis was particularly renowned for his Eephus pitch, which he had used with success in the big leagues against sluggers such as Johnny Mize. Tamulis remained in the Nashville area after his baseball career, and died there in 1974 at age 62.

The song was produced by and features will.i.am. The artists co-wrote the song with Kara DioGuardi and Keith Harris. \\"Baby Love\\" was released from September 18, 2007 by A&M; and Interscope Records, as the mixed single from Scherzinger's unreleased debut studio album, Her Name Is Nicole. The folk-inspired R&B; ballad is about a person's first premature love with someone. \\"Baby Love\\" received a mixed reception contemporary critics, with reviewers complementing Scherzinger's vocal ability, but dismissing the song for not being the type of song to launch a career with. However, the song managed to peak in the top twenty in thirteen countries including Germany, Italy, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Ireland. An accompanying music video directed by Francis Lawrence and was filmed on Catalina Island in California. Scherzinger performed \\"Baby Love\\" in a series of live appearances such as a performance at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007. Background and composition Following the poor commercial success of \\"Whatever U Like\\", it was announced that Scherzinger would release a new single. The song was used for German Vybemobile's TV commercial and Samsung's campaign. \\"Baby Love\\" is included on several international editions of The Pussycat Dolls' second studio album Doll Domination (2008) and is listed as an original song, performed by Scherzinger and will.i.am entitled as the \\"Final Version\\" on the standard edition. The version on the album is the official remix of the song by J. R. Rotem with a new arrangement and re-recorded vocals. \\"Baby Love\\" is a mid-tempo folk- inspired R&B; ballad, and produced by will.i.am. It was written by Scherzinger, William Adams, Kara DioGuardi and Keith Harris, in the musical key of F minor. The \\"laid-back vibe\\" of the song was compared to that of the Pussycat Dolls' song \\"Stickwitu\\" (2005) and Fergie's song \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" (2006), that was also produced by will.i.am. According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song has a time signature set in common time, with a tempo of 90 beats per minute. The melody is mainly composed with piano and guitar instruments.  Critical reception  A reviewer for the Manchester Evening News wrote that it's \\"a nice little number which highlights her above average vocals.\\" Chart performance The single achieved reasonable success outside of the United States, particularly in Europe. This is likely due to Scherzinger's performance at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 on November 1, 2007, in which she sang the song with will.i.am, the producer and featured artist of the song. The song peaked at number fourteen on the UK Singles Chart. It also became a top ten hit in the Germany and Italy. Although the song was not successful on the Billboard Hot 100, it reached number four on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play and peaked at number 8 at Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Music video Scherzinger lying on a yacht as seen in the music video. The video was shot on Catalina Island, California, and was directed by Francis Lawrence. The music video premiered on September 24, 2007. =Synopsis= The video opens with Scherzinger in bed, inserting a video memory stick into a laptop. She is just in her white bra and panties. We then see lots of clouds, before seeing Scherzinger waking up lying in bed with her lover. She rolls on top of him, before going outside still in her underwear with a grey cardigan over the top. The boat then cruises along and Nicole makes several appearances in a white bikini. Then we see her lie on a sun bed under her lover in a black bikini. He is shirtless, and gazes down at her. She then shows the video footage to him on her camera. She then sings to the camera presumably naked, with us only seeing her face and her legs. She then lies in the sun in her white bikini. She then dives into the ocean in her black bikini, followed by her lover. They then appear underwater, hugging each other. After that, on a beach, Nicole kisses her lovers shoulders. She then dances in front of the camera in a black and peach bikini. She then is seen hugging her lover (they both are presumed naked, making love) on the beach. Nicole and her lover take a trip on a motorbike soon after. Nicole is in hot pants and a black jacket. Will.i.am then makes his debut singing a solo verse in the distance. We then see Nicole in her black and peach bikini lying down on the sand. Her lover is filming her from above. Nicole then is seen semi nude, with her hands covering her breasts. Then she is seen playing around with her lover in the sea. They splash around and Nicole then is seen on the edge of the boat, in a blue dress. More semi nude appearances follow. But then we return to the bed, which was seen at the start. Nicole is now kneeling on top of her boyfriend, in her white bra and panties. She sings to him whilst he strokes her hips and touches the sides of her panties. She then leans down to kiss his cheek softly. He kisses her arm. The video ends with Scherzinger making one final semi nude appearance, covering her breasts with her hands. She giggles and the scene fades.  Live performances  On October 2007 she performed at KIIS-FM’s Homecoming concert at the Honda Center and performed \\"Whatever U Like\\", \\"Baby Love\\" and \\"Supervillain\\".

Most electronic fluency devices change the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Electronic fluency device Types Electronic fluency devices can be divided into two basic categories. *Computerized feedback devices provide feedback on the physiological control of respiration and phonation, including loudness, vocal intensity and breathing patterns.Ward (2006) p. 300 *Altered auditory feedback (AAF) devices alter the speech signal so that speakers hear their voices differently. Computerized feedback devices Computerized feedback devices (such as CAFET or Dr. Fluency) use computer technology to increase control over breathing and phonation. A microphone gathers information about the stutterer’s speech and feedback is delivered on a computer screen. Measurements include intensity (loudness), voice quality, breathing patterns, and voicing strategies. These programs are designed to train features related to prolonged speech, a treatment technique which is frequently used in stuttering therapy. No peer-reviewed studies have been published showing the effectiveness of commercial systems in a clinical context. A study of electromyographic (EMG) feedback in children and adolescents found it to be as effective as other treatments (home-based and clinic-based smooth speech training) in the short and longterm. Altered auditory feedback devices Altered auditory feedback (AAF) such as singing, choral speaking, masking, delayed or frequency altered feedback have long been known to reduce stuttering.Ward (2006) p. 293Saltuklaroglu and Kalinowski (2006) p. 173-4 Early altered auditory feedback devices were large and thus confined to the laboratory or therapy room, but advances in electronics have permitted increasingly portable devices such as Derazne Correctophone, the Edinburgh Masker, the Vocaltech Clinical Vocal Feedback Device, the Fluency Master and the SpeechEasy. Current devices may be similar in size and appearance to a hearing aid, including in-the-ear and completely-in-the-canal models. =Masking= White noise masking has been well documented to reduce stuttering. Clinic-based and portable devices, such as the Edinburgh Masker (since discontinued) have been developed to deliver masking, and found that masking was effective in reducing stuttering,Stuttering: A Brief Review though many found that reduction in stuttering faded with time.Ward (2006) p. 298 Interest in masking reduced during the 1980s as a result of studies finding delayed auditory feedback and frequency altered feedback were more effective in reducing stuttering. =Delayed auditory feedback= The effect of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) in reducing stuttering has been noted since the 1950s.Ward, p. 48Saltuklaroglu and Kalinowski (2006), p. 239 A DAF user hears his or her voice in headphones, delayed a fraction of a second. Typical delays are in the 50 millisecond to 200 millisecond range. In stutterers, DAF may produce slow, prolonged but fluent speech. In the 1960s to 1980s, DAF was mainly used to train prolongation and fluency. As the stutterer masters fluent speech skills at a slow speaking rate, the delay is reduced in stages, gradually increasing speaking rate, until the person can speak fluently at a normal speaking rate.Ward, p. 49 It was not until the 1990s that research began to focus on DAF in isolation. Recent studies have moved from longer delays to shorter delays in the 50 millisecond to 75 millisecond range, and have found that speakers can maintain fast rates and achieve increased fluency at these delays. Delayed auditory feedback presented binaurally (i.e. in both ears) is more effective than that presented in monaurally, or in one ear only. =Frequency-altered feedback= Pitch-shifting frequency-altered auditory feedback (FAF) changes the pitch at which the user hears his or her voice. Varying pitch from quarter, half or full octave shift typically results in 55–74% decreases stuttering in short reading tasks. Individuals differ as to direction and extent of the pitch shift required to maximally reduce stuttering. In studies that gave longer exposure to FAF and used more meaningful daily life tasks such as generating a monologue, only some participants experienced a reduction in stuttering. Initial claims that AAF was more powerful than FAF in reducing stuttering have not been supported by subsequent research. FAF is, like DAF, more effective when presented binaurally. In the last years a number of smart phone apps have been developed that implement DAF/FAF as software and are much cheaper than the special hardware devices, see External links. =Effectiveness= Studies have shown that altered auditory feedback (including delayed auditory feedback, frequency altered feedback) as provided by devices such as the Casa Futura School DAF machine or SpeechEasy can immediately reduce stuttering by 40 to 80 per cent in reading tasks.Ward (2006), p. 299 Laboratory studies suggest that reductions in stuttering with an electronic fluency device can occur without a reduced speech rate, and that speech naturalness is often enhanced with AAF. However, the effects of altered feedback are highly individualistic, with some obtaining considerable increases in fluency, while others receive little or no benefit. A 2006 review of stuttering treatments noted that none of the treatment studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality. In addition, studies have been critiqued for failing to demonstrate ecological validity; in particular that AAF effects continue over the long term and in everyday speaking situations. The high-profile promotion in the media of devices such as the \\"SpeechEasy\\" has been criticized as inappropriate given the lack of scientific evidence for their effectiveness. There are few published studies on the effect of the AAF in the daily activities of life; studies have mainly examined the effect of AAF on short oral reading tasks, with some studying the giving of a monologue that is usually short in duration. Several studies have produced group results that stutterers using the SpeechEasy show greater reductions in reading than for monologue and conversation. Using AAF was effective in reducing stuttering in scripted telephone calls and giving presentations according to two studies. Another study examining the effects of the SpeechEasy in more naturalistic situations (conversation and asking questions of strangers outside the clinic) found that the SpeechEasy failed to show a significant effect following 6 months of use, though individual subjects varied in their response. A further study examining the use of the device during phone and face to face conversation also found wide variations in stuttering reduction, with just under half exhibiting stable improvement over the course of the 4 months of the study. While there is evidence of the immediate, short-term effectiveness of AAF devices in reducing stuttering, the longterm effects of altered feedback are unclear. There is some limited experimental data that in some speakers the effect of AAF may fade after a few minutes of exposure, and some anecdotal reports suggest that over time users receive continued but lessened effects from their device.Ward (2006), p. 296, 298 While one group study has reported continued overall reductions in stuttering after a year of daily use of the SpeechEasy on reading and a monologue task, others have found that some participants showed adaptation effects, gaining less benefit from the device after exposure for several months, including stuttering more with the device than without it. Some studies of various altered auditory feedback devices have noted carryover fluency, i.e. a reduction in stuttering after the stutterer removes an electronic fluency device, while others have not. The effective of electronic fluency devices as measured by qualitative measures and ratings by stutterers have also been made. Studies show that some stutterers report improved fluency and confidence about speaking, and less severe stuttering and some carryover effects; the device is perceived as being particularly useful on the telephone. They reported that the device was difficult to use in noisy situations as the device amplifies all voices and sounds, and some acclimatization to the use of the device over time. Qualitative reports of satisfaction may be disassociated from more objective measures of fluency: some stutterers who gain little or no benefit from a device based on objective measures rate the device highly, while others who were obtaining benefit on measures of fluency reported negatives opinions about the device. =Use with children= There is little experimental evaluation of the therapeutic effect of AAF on children who stutter: one study noted that effects of FAF were less in children than adults. Given the lack of evidence of its effectiveness, as well as concerns about the impact of altered feedback on developing speech and language systems, some authors have expressed the view that the use of an AAF with children would be unethical. =Causes of altered auditory feedback effects= The precise reasons for the fluency-inducing effects of AAF in stutterers are unknown. Early investigators suggested that those who stutter had an abnormal speech–auditory feedback loop that was corrected or bypassed while speaking under DAF. Later researchers proposed increased fluency was actually caused by the changes in speech production, including slower speech rates, higher pitches and increased loudness, rather than the AAF per se.Ward, 2006, p. 50 However, subsequent studies have noted that increased fluency occurred in some stutterers at normal and fast rates using DAF. Some suggest that stuttering is caused by defective auditory processing, and that AAF helps to correct the misperceived rhythmic structure of speech. It has been shown that some stutterers have noted that have atypical auditory anatomy and that DAF improved fluency in these stutterers but not in those with typical anatomy. However, positron emission tomography studies on choral reading in stutterers suggest that AAF also made changes in motor and speech production areas of the brain, as well as the auditory processing areas. Choral reading reduced the overactivity in motor areas that is found with stuttered reading, and largely reversed the left-hemisphere based auditory-system and speech production system underactivation. Noting that the effects of altered feedback vary from person to person and can wear off over time, distraction has also been proposed as a possible cause of stuttering reduction with AAF.Ward, 2006, p. 57 References External links *DAF/FAF Aid for iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad *DAF Assistant for Android *The National Stuttering Association's Position on the Speech Easy and other assistive devices Anti- stuttering devices ","title":"Electronic fluency device"},{"id":"13269224","text":"Math and Physics Club are an American indie pop band based in Seattle, Washington, United States. Its members are Charles Bert (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Ethan Jones (bass, keyboards). James Werle played lead guitar until he died in 2018. Kevin Emerson (drums) continues to play on recordings though no longer a full time member of the band. The band has released three EPs and four full-length albums on Santa Barbara-based Matinee Recordings, with UK distribution on Fika Recordings. They are often associated with Australian labelmates The Lucksmiths and twee pop band Tullycraft, and Pitchfork Media described their work as \\"music to hold hands to\\" after The Lucksmiths' song on the album \\"Why That Doesn't Surprise Me\\". Biography Math and Physics Club began as a basement project for longtime friends Charles Bert (vocals) and James Werle (guitar). Their first release was a digital-only single on Comfort Stand Recordings which featured an early version of the song \\"Graduation Day\\", along with a b-side titled \\"Everybody Lies\\". Both songs featured keyboards by early collaborator Andrew Hall, according to the Comfort Stand web site, and who is also credited with playing keyboards on two songs on their first EP, and is credited as a co-writer with the band on the song \\"Nothing Really Happened\\" on their third EP. By mid-2004, the band's lineup featured Kevin Emerson on drums, Saundrah Humphrey on violin, and Ethan Jones on bass. The band's initial demo attracted the attention of both Jimmy Tassos of Matinee Recordings and the influential KEXP DJ John Richards. As they played their third show in December, they were already receiving considerable attention, including frequent spins on KEXP. The four-song EP Weekends Away was released in February 2005 and received heavy radio play on stations such as KEXP and WOXY, picking up several reviews from the indiepop press. By late spring the band finally had a handful of shows under its belt, including a few West Coast stops with new labelmates The Lucksmiths, and an appearance at the annual Sasquatch! Music Festival (headlined by the Pixies). The Movie Ending Romance EP was released in July 2005 to further reviews and growing live audiences. The audience at the San Francisco Pop Festival saw them perform 'A is for Alphabet' with Razorcuts leader Gregory Webster on vocals. In September 2005, the band enjoyed playing to a packed crowd at Seattle’s Bumbershoot music festival. Shortly afterward, the band began recording their debut LP Math and Physics Club which was released a year later in October 2006, meriting a favorable review from Pitchfork Media and named \\"Best Indie Pop Album of 2006\\" by PopMatters. The band's third EP Baby I'm Yours was unveiled on October 1, 2007 with a short tour through southern California. Saundrah left the band in late 2007, and drummer Kevin Emerson left the band officially shortly thereafter, although he has continued to drum on their recordings. In the summer of 2009, they began recording their second full-length album at Jupiter Studios in Seattle with producer Martin Feveyear (Mark Lanegan, Presidents of the USA), which emerged in June 2010 as I Shouldn't Look As Good As I Do. Bassist Ethan Jones toured with indie-rock three-piece Eux Autres briefly between 2010 and early 2011, playing shows supporting Wild Flag on the West Coast of the US, and touring the UK, France and Italy. In the Summer of 2011, Math and Physics Club toured the UK for the first time, with stops in Glasgow, Manchester, London, Nottingham and at the Derby-based Indietracks festival. In August 2012, they began recording their third LP in at K Records' Dub Narcotic Studio, with Bob Schwenkler engineering. On January 23, Matinee Recordings announced on their Facebook page that this material would be released in 2013 as Our Hearts Beat Out Loud. The group's fourth album, Lived Here Before, was released on January 26, 2018. Bert and Werle were both raised in Olympia, Washington, home of K Records and Kill Rock Stars, and they soaked up a thriving indie music scene. Before convening Math and Physics Club they were in a band called Drive Car Girl (named after a Beat Happening song). They played about a dozen shows at local clubs and coffee houses with a set of 12-15 original songs, along with covers of songs by REM, Nancy Sinatra and Kraftwerk. Former members of Drive Car Girl include Brent Cole Whats Up Magazine and Sean Berry Double Crown Records. Elsewhere, Ethan shared guitar chords with high school friend Carrie Brownstein and later, as a student at The Evergreen State College featured in Jenny Jenkins' musical \\"Love Is Stupid\\" opposite Mirah. Ethan also began the Internet's first Beach Boys related mailing list, called \\"surfsup\\", in January 1994. James Werle died of cancer in September 2018. Influences Math and Physics Club can be seen as musical descendants of C86 and Sarah Records although no formal connection exists. They are also influenced by The Softies, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, The Posies, Belle and Sebastian, Beat Happening, and The Lucksmiths.

Academic LIU Global offers only one degree-granting program, culminating in a B.A. in Global Studies. However, LIU Global also offers semester-long or year-long study abroad options for visiting students (approximately 20 transfer and/or visiting students are accepted per year). All incoming freshmen are required to complete their first year of study at LIU Global's Costa Rica Center, which is based in Heredia, Costa Rica with excursions to Nicaragua and Panama. In the second year, students participate in LIU Global's Europe Program which, in the fall, is based in Alcalá, Spain, with excursions to London and Berlin. In the spring the Europe program is based in Florence, Italy, with excursions to Vienna, Budapest, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Juniors can choose to spend a year at the China Center in Hangzhou, China which offers excursions to Beijing, Shanghai, Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces in Western China; Hong Kong; and Taiwan. They may also travel with the Asia-Pacific Australia Program to Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand in the fall and Australia and Bali in the spring. The final year of the program begins with the International Research and Internship Semester (IRIS), an independently designed research project centered around an internship at the LIU Global Center or Program of the student's choice. This culminates in a semester in New York City, where students complete a series of capstone experiences, a second senior-year internship, and a senior thesis. History LIU Global was founded in 1965 as Friends World College through an initiative of New York Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Originally conceived as an international Quaker seminary, FWC's first campus was located on an abandoned airport, Mitchel Field, near Hempstead, NY, where the College's programs occupied unused barracks and hangars. In the early 1970s, the College acquired the Livingston estate in Lloyd Harbor, New York through a bequest, and by 1972, it had relocated its North American center there, and in accordance with its vision for international education, had established satellite campuses in England, Kenya, India, Guatemala and Japan. Later, it established campuses in Costa Rica, Israel, and China. In order that its students might qualify for federally- guaranteed student loans and other Federal programs, the College dropped its formal Quaker affiliation in the mid-1970s and became nominally non-sectarian. However, the President at that time, Dr. George Watson, had already established a Quaker meeting on campus, and this remained until shortly before the College merged with Long Island University. By the mid- to late-1980s, the College had encountered financial difficulties, and the sudden failure of its Israel program, plus the loss of a US student to malaria in Kenya, helped bring about the Trustees' decision to accept an offer for merger from LIU. The Dickinson Campus was sold to provide a much-needed cash influx, and re- christened 'Friends World Program', the North American campus was moved to LIU's [Southampton College] during the 1991–1992 academic year. In the Fall of 2005, the program moved to LIU's Brooklyn Campus; thus the New York City Center was established. During this period the name 'Friends' was dropped, and the College became known as 'Global Studies LIU'. In March 2007, the name Global College was adopted. In January 2012, LIU launched an institution-wide 're-branding campaign', and Global College became LIU Global. Around 70-90 students are currently enrolled at their centers and program sites worldwide. =Currently operating centers= * New York Center, Brooklyn, New York * Costa Rica Center, Heredia City, Costa Rica * China Center, Hangzhou, China =Currently operating programs= * Asia-Pacific Australia Program, Byron Bay, Australia * Europe Program, Spain, London, Berlin, Italy, Vienna, Budapest, Bosnia and Herzegovina =Suspended centers= Regional centers are sometimes shut down indefinitely due to lack of funds, lack of demand, or security or health risks.

The episode was written by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage and directed by Mark Piznarski. It was made available as a free download on iTunes on September 14, 2007, prior to its official television debut on CTV in Canada on September 18, 2007, and on The CW in the United States the following day. Plot Serena van der Woodsen's (Blake Lively) mysterious return to Manhattan after a year-long stint at a boarding school in Connecticut becomes the talk of the town when the news of her homecoming is posted on a popular Upper East Side blog site published by an unknown character by the screen name of \\"Gossip Girl\\" (voiced by Kristen Bell). Serena's best friend, Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), however, is less than thrilled to see her again, especially when her plans of losing her virginity to her boyfriend, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), are interrupted when Serena arrives unexpectedly at a party. In spite of their heart-to-heart talk together, Serena and Blair's re-ignited friendship is short-lived when Nate confesses to her that he and Serena slept together the night before she left, and although Blair forgives Nate, she refuses to forgive Serena. Outsider Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) who has a secret crush on Serena, which dates back even before her mysterious departure, is once again drawn to her as soon as he learns that she has arrived back in town and, after trying to return Serena's phone to her, she asks him out on a date simply as an excuse not to go to Blair's \\"Kiss on the Lips\\" party. Dan takes Serena to his dad's band's concert, but they are forced to leave when his younger sister Jenny (Taylor Momsen) sends him a text message from Blair's party asking for help. Dan and Serena turn heads as they burst in on the party and search frantically for Jenny. They find her on the roof, where an egotistical sex-addicted Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) is attempting to rape her. Dan punches Chuck and he and Serena leave in disgust, hand-in- hand with Jenny tagging along. The apparent reason for Serena's abrupt return is revealed to be her younger brother Eric (Connor Paolo), who unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide but is now living in a psychiatric institution. Not even \\"Gossip Girl\\" is aware of this. In addition, the past affair between Dan and Jenny's father Rufus (Matthew Settle) and Serena and Eric's mother is brought to light when Lily (Kelly Rutherford) asks Rufus whether he is using his son to get close to her again. Production =Casting= Featuring nine regular speaking roles, the majority of the ensemble cast were assembled from February to April 2007. Blake Lively and Leighton Meester were the first two actresses to be chosen in February for the lead roles of Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf respectively. Penn Badgley, Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, Connor Paolo and Florencia Lozano also auditioned successfully and landed roles in the series in March. Actors for the roles of Chuck Bass and Rufus Humphrey were found in April when Ed Westwick and Matthew Settle were cast. As rumors swirled about the impending cancellation of Veronica Mars, it was revealed at The CW's 2007 Upfronts on May 17, 2007, that Kristen Bell had narrated the pilot, thus making her the title character of another show on the network. =Costume and design= With the premiere of the fourth season, New York magazine interviewed Gossip Girl costume designer Eric Daman, who cited Serena's French striped t-shirt, leather jacket, and attire in the Pilot opening as one of Serena's most iconic outfits and one of his eleven favorite looks from the series. Entertainment Weekly's Meeta Agrawal places Blake Lively's Serena van der Woodsen amongst the wearers of the 20 Knockout Dresses of the 2000s.

Its digital video recorder ratings were high, increasing the show's profitability. The show has also been in the top five of iTunes sales. Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret Morning News noted that Gossip Girl is milder than a lot of what's shown on MTV, but still warned parents of several scenes in the pilot. He said it includes \\"among other things, a teenage girl climbing on top of a boy and removing his clothes; drunken teens having sex; teens smoking pot; teens drinking in bars, in a limo and at a party; a teen boy getting amorous with a girl who fights him off; and that same teen boy essentially attempting to rape a freshman girl who is supposed to be, what, 14?\\". In the United Kingdom Gossip Girl scored an average of 520,000 viewers on ITV2. The pilot is the second highest-rated episode in the series (proceeding \\"The Dark Night\\" with 3.73), pulling a 3.50.

History The tournament began in 1973 as a high school boys' basketball tournament with a seven-team format. The earliest editions featured teams primarily from the Fort Myers News-Press' high school coverage area, but there were some quality teams from around the state, including Lakeland High, Brandon, Pompano Beach, Glades Central and Okeechobee. In 1985, Bill Pollock, a Fort Myers resident whose son, John, was a rising senior at Fort Myers High School, became involved in the tournament, as did the News-Press' preps editor, Donnie Wilkie. The two have teamed ever since, and the tournament, sponsored by Bank of America (formerly Barnett Bank and NationsBank), quickly skyrocketed into a major national event. Pollock's son led Fort Myers to the 1985 tournament championship against a still-mostly- local field. Currently, the tournament consists of a 16-team national bracket, with selected \\"Sunshine Series\\" games (featuring additional high school teams from Florida and Georgia) dotting the schedule throughout the typically six- day event. Among the early breakthroughs for the tournament was a riveting, triple-overtime championship game in 1989, in which Flint Hill School, led by Randolph Childress, Cory Alexander and Serge Zwikker, defeated Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York), led by Norman Marbury and Tchaka Shipp, 70-68, on a last-second 3-pointer by Childress, who went on to stardom at Wake Forest University. Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia) made its lone appearance (the Florida High School Athletic Association will no longer sanction them to play) in 1991, finishing third after losing to Franklin Learning Center from Philadelphia in the semifinals. Two years later, in 1993, the tournament made history with a field that included Danny Fortson, Ron Mercer, Tim Thomas and future NFL quarterback Daunte Culpepper—all in consolation brackets. Crenshaw High School (Los Angeles, California) won that year's tournament, scoring 117, 99 and 98 points in three of its four games, and finished the season ranked No. 3 in the nation by USA Today. St. Augustine High School (New Orleans, Louisiana) won the following year and went on to capture USA Today's mythical national championship in boys' basketball. The success in the early and mid 1990s catapulted the tournament into national prominence. The tournament has remained a highlight on the national schedule ever since, drawing the interest of major-college coaches and recruiting analysts alike. Currently, 118 McDonald's All-Americans have played in this pre-Christmas event,http://cityofpalmsclassic.com/about/history/mcdonalds-all- american/ and , there were 51 former participants on NBA rosters, including Nerlens Noel, John Wall, Kevin Love, Greg Monroe, Chandler Parsons, LaMarcus Aldridge, Andrew Wiggins, and Julius Randle. Montverde Academy became the first school to win consecutive City of Palms Classic titles since the tournament expanded beyond local teams in 2013, defeating Paul VI High School. Montverde's two championship wins were led by stars Dakari Johnson (2012), D'Angelo Russell (2012/13), and Ben Simmons (2013). Montverde also played in the 2014 championship game, but was denied a three-peat by Wheeler High School and star player Jaylen Brown. The final tournament played at Bishop Verot was won by Chino Hills High School, who defeated The Patrick School from Elizabeth, New Jersey. The Patrick School was coached by Mike Rice, on the sidelines for the first time since being fired as the Rutgers coach. Locations The event has had five hosts in its 43-year history, including Edison Community College (Fort Myers, Florida) from 1973–83 and twice more in 1990 and '93, Cape Coral High School (Cape Coral, Florida) in 1984, Fort Myers High School (Fort Myers, Florida) from 1985–89 and the Harborside Convention Hall in downtown Fort Myers in 1991 and '92. The tournament found a long-term home when a new, 2,300-seat gymnasium was built at Bishop Verot High School (Fort Myers, Florida), where it was played from 1994 to 2015. In 2016, the tournament moves to Suncoast Credit Union Arena, a 3,300-seat facility on the campus of Florida SouthWestern State College.

Her books cover a wide range of human experience, from the mysteries of the Kabbalah to the lives of Italian American immigrants. She writes both as a solo author and in collaboration with New York Times best- selling author Jill Gregory.  Early life  Tintori was born East Lansing, Michigan. Her father, Raymond, a World War II veteran and Michigan State University graduate, had married a Sicilian American named Joanne two years earlier against the advice of his first-generation Italian American mother. When she was six weeks old, the new family moved out of their trailer and headed west to Detroit. Tintori was raised in the 1950s and early 1960s, the oldest of three children in a close-knit working-class neighborhood near the predominantly Polish enclave of Hamtramck. Caught between the values of the old world and a post-war society teeming with change, Tintori's early life was both simple and conflicted. While she fully embraced her Italian heritage, she questioned some of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Her liberal parents encouraged her to be inquisitive and fulfill her potential but to be aware that she still lived in a world of limitations.  Education  Tintori was among that first generation of \\"liberated\\" women encouraged to obtain a college education. She has described her transition from salutatorian of a class of 36 at St. Augustine High School to Detroit's Wayne State University in the mid '60s as life changing: Tintori majored in journalism and became a stringer for The New York Times. She joined the student newspaper, The Daily Collegian, as a staff writer just before New Leftists gained control of the paper in 1967 and changed its name to The South End. While other reporters jumped ship, she stayed on, continuing to write stories free of the political dogma that pervaded the rest of its content. There, she met and started dating another reporter and future law student, Lawrence Katz, who would later become her husband. Tintori was acquiring an identity. These new people and new ideas changed her dramatically, but she was not a rebel. While she was seriously contemplating conversion to Judaism, she wanted her parents' understanding if not approval. While she shared the tenets of the new feminism, she looked forward to competing in the two traditional Italian beauty contests scheduled for 1968, her sophomore year. That year, she became Miss Detroit Fruit Vendors' Association and Miss Columbus Day. Tintori earned an undergraduate degree in journalism from W.S.U. in 1970. In August, 2019, together with her husband, she attended an immersion Italian language course at Scuola Dante Alighieri Recanati, affiliated with The University of Camerino, obtaining an attestato.  Conversion to Judaism  A year after her graduation, Tintori began religious conversion classes. The day had finally arrived to tell her parents: With her parents' support, Tintori was converted by a bet din – a legal court of three rabbis – at an Orthodox mikveh at the age of 24.  Marriage and Family Life  In 1972, she was married by a Conservative rabbi to Lawrence Katz. The early years of their marriage were spent establishing professional careers and traveling. In 1979, Tintori gave birth to the couple's first son, Mitchel, and in 1982, to their second, Steven. The couple still lives in the same home in West Bloomfield, Michigan, where they raised their now-grown children. At a mother-toddler class in 1981, she met another young mother, Jill Gregory, already a best-selling romance novelist. As their children, Mitchel and Rachel, struck up a friendship, so did Tintori and Gregory.  Early Professional Career  At the urging of her father, Tintori eschewed news journalism for a career in marketing and public relations. She worked for an advertising agency and then a flowers-by-wire organization, as an assistant editor of its monthly magazine, and for a professional organization associated with the automobile industry. In the years before the birth of her first son, she was a marketing officer for a financial institution. When Mitchel was born, she quit to raise him on a full-time basis and never returned to corporate life.  Writing career  Tintori's friendship with Jill Gregory quickly developed into a professional relationship. After trying to figure out a sensitive way to answer their children's questions about life and death, Tintori and Gregory decided to write a book designed to answer a wide range of questions children ask about God. The result was What Does Being Jewish Mean?, in conjunction with Rabbi E.B Freedman, published by Simon & Schuster in 1991. The book has been reprinted 11 times and used by children and adults, Jews and non-Jews alike, as a primer on the basic concepts and principles of Judaism. Unlike other team efforts, Tintori and Gregory did not divide up or delegate tasks. Instead, they developed their thoughts and wrote in a single style, sitting side-by- side. This ability to write together, in one voice, has characterized their entire body of work since. Both writers have publicly discussed their writing methodology and the ability of each to anticipate the other's thoughts and even complete her sentences. The success of their first collaborative effort spurred them on to the next. In 1993, under the pseudonym Jillian Karr (a combination of Jill and Karen), they published Something Borrowed, Something Blue (Doubleday, Bantam Books). The novel - a story of intrigue involving four brides-to-be with secrets - was excerpted by Cosmopolitan Magazine and released as a made-for-TV movie starring Connie Sellecca, Twiggy and Ken Howard. In 1996, again writing as Jillian Karr, the writing team published Catch Me If You Can (Avon Books), a suspense novel about a kidnapped Miss America. Both Jillian Karr books were published in hardcover and paperback editions and in multiple languages. Having been told that her paternal grandfather had survived the Cherry Mine disaster, the worst mine fire in the history of the United States, Tintori began an exploration into the disaster that took the lives of 259 men and boys deep inside an Illinois coal mine. The result was Trapped: The 1909 Cherry Mine Disaster (Atria Books, 2002). The book explores the senseless way the fire began, the failed efforts to rescue those down below, the heroism both above and below ground, and the impact it had on the lives of those involved. Increasingly interested in her family genealogy and heritage, she recounts the experiences of immigrants, including her own relatives, who had recently come from countries throughout Europe - particularly Italy - seeking success and finding only suffering and death in that mine. After its hardcover release, the book was published in paperback. Trapped has been optioned for film. In 2007, she returned to the world of fiction, again collaborating with her writing partner. Now writing as Karen Tintori and Jill Gregory, the duo published The Book of Names (St. Martin's Press). The book is a thriller based on the actual principles of the Kabbalah, which teaches that the world's existence requires that it be occupied by 36 righteous souls, called Lamed Vovniks, or Tzadikim Nistarim in Hebrew. The novel begins with 33 of them murdered and the start of a race to keep them alive. The book has been published worldwide and translated into 20 languages. In particular, it is a best-seller in Germany, where websites and contests have been created about the book, with prizes including a trip to England. The book is published in hardcover, paperback, audio and electronic formats. Later that same year, Tintori revealed her own family's secret history – buried for 80 years out of guilt and shame – when she published Unto The Daughters: The Legacy of an Honor Killing in a Sicilian-American Family [(St. Martin's Press)]. The book is a narrative nonfiction about the murder of her great aunt, Frances Costa, in a Sicilian honor killing in Detroit 1919. Tintori has explained that she wrote the book to give Aunt Frances back her name and identity, to expose the ugly customs and traditions of honor for honor's sake, and to restore dignity to the new generations of women who followed. In that sense, Unto The Daughters is not only an account of the legacy of Sicilian culture but an intensely personal family memoir. The book has been published in hardcover, paperback and electronic formats and was nominated for a Michigan Notable Book Award. In 2008, The Illumination, another collaboration by Tintori and Gregory, was published by St. Martin's Press and simultaneously by Rowholt in Germany. This spiritual thriller, centered on a biblical treasure from the dawn of creation possessing the power to transform—or destroy—the world, also sold to numerous foreign countries. The book has been published in hardcover, paperback, audio and electronic formats. Tintori's first short story, Down Under, was included in the first anthology released by Novelists Inc., published in 2012 by Fiction Studio Books. Edited by Lou Aronica, Cast of Characters is a multi-genre collection of short stories by 28 leading voices in fiction, including 11 New York Times bestselling authors. The anthology is published in paperback and electronic formats. Tintori contributed two pieces to Italian Women in Chicago: Madonna Mia! QUI debbo vivere? an anthology published in 2013 by Casa Italia, Chicago. Edited by Dominic Candeloro, Kathy Catrambone, and Gloria Nardini, the book was published the same year in Italy as Donne Italiane a Chicago. The anthology is printed in paperback. Tintori has also contributed to She Rises: How Goddess Feminism, Activism, and Spirituality? Volume 2, an anthology by MAGO Books. She has written for The Fifth Estate, The Detroit Jewish News, Primo Magazine, Ovunque Siamo, and The Hamtramck Citizen (recapping her half hour alone, backstage, with The Beatles). Tintori is a member of Novelists Inc., International Thriller Writers, the Italian American Studies Association and Italian American Writers Association.  Relationship to Italy and Commitment to Italian American Heritage  Increasingly interested in her Italian heritage, Tintori acquired Italian citizenship in 2006, and is now a dual citizen of the U.S. and Italy. She and her husband have been studying the Italian language for many years, have traveled in Italy more than a dozen times, and have grown increasingly close to its land and people. Tintori has cousins on both sides of her family, in Modena, Tuscany, and Sicily. Tintori has also developed working relationships with several other writers in Italy. Among her paternal ancestors are famed architects Giovanni and Bernardo Parrocchetti from Varese, near Milan. The two designed numerous churches and bridges in Italy. After designing the Ponte d'Olina in Pavullo, which connected Modena with Pistoia for the first time in the 1500s, the two set down roots in that area of Modena. The brothers were granted knighthood by the Duke of Milan.

Work Fusing the natural energies of her native Iceland with an explosive, however organic, abstract expressionism often filtered through painterly installations, Katrin Fridriks explores speed, gravity, and growth along with the interaction of man and nature in different media. One of her creations is installed at the Nautical stadium in Nîmes, but a section of her work connecting with land art has also been an important element in her process. Her painterly creations are often integrated into paintscapes, site-specific installation that exceed the limits of painting traditionally conceived.

It was established in 1946 by Subchapter II of the Lanham Act, to allow the domestic registration of trademarks that do not meet all the requirements for registration on the Principal Register, so that the holder(s) of such a mark could register it in another country. This was necessary because under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property foreign registration was not permitted in the absence of domestic registration, and the trademark laws of countries outside the U.S. often have less stringent registration requirements for marks. The only requirement for registration on the Supplemental Register is that a mark be capable of distinguishing goods or services, not that it actually serve such a function. Owners of the registrations on the Supplemental Register are still permitted to sue for trademark infringement in federal court based upon their statutory rights created by owning a federal registration, but must prove that the registered term actually functions as mark. Unlike a mark registered on the Principal Register, the Supplemental Registration provides no evidence of trademark rights in the registered term in a court proceeding. The supplemental registration is contestable, i.e., it may be cancelled if a third party proves earlier use or superior rights. A Supplemental Register listing does not in itself provide evidence that the listed mark is actually a trademark for purposes of the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).

Based upon parallax measurements from the Hipparcos mission, it is located approximately 30 light- years away. The star is orbited by a Super-Earth. Planetary system A planetary companion to Gliese 176 was announced in 2008. Radial velocity observations with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) showed a 10.24-day periodicity, which was interpreted as being caused by a planet. With a semi- amplitude of 11.6 m/s, its minimum mass equated to 24.5 Earth masses, or approximately 1.4 Neptune masses. Observations with the HARPS spectrograph could not confirm the 10.24-day variation. Instead, two other periodicities were detected at 8.78 and 40.0 days, with amplitudes below the HET observational errors. The 40-day variation coincides with the rotational period of the star and is therefore caused by activity, but the shorter-period variation is not explained by activity and is therefore caused by a planet. Its semi-amplitude of 4.1 m/s corresponds to a minimum mass of 8.4 Earth masses, making the planet a Super-Earth. In an independent study, observations with Keck-HIRES also failed to confirm the 10.24-day signal. An 8.77-day periodicity - corresponding to the planet announced by the HARPS team - was detected to intermediate significance, though it was not deemed significant enough to claim a planetary cause with their data alone.

A close friend of Sir John Mills, he directed the BBC/Carlton documentary of Mills' life, Sir John Mills' Moving Memories. Dillistone and Mills first collaborated on Dillistone's film The Troop, which had a Royal Premiere at BAFTA in the presence of The Princess Royal. A copy of the film was requested by a Royal Equerry for screening to The Queen at Sandringham over Christmas. A 35mm film print was donated by Fujifilm, Technicolor, and Glory Film Co. Dillistone directed Mills in his last ever screen appearance, Lights 2, in which he played a tramp. Shot at Pinewood Studios, Mills was lit by veteran cinematographer Jack Cardiff, they had last worked together on 'Scott of The Antarctic'. Dillistone is currently collaborating with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood on the film-to-digital reformatting and restoration of his film The Troop. The Academy selected The Troop as a case study in using its ACES color management methodology; also contributing to the study are Dolby Laboratories, EFilm, Fotokem, and Universal.https://www.etcentric.org/the-troop-redux-aces- reformatting-and-archiving-project/ Education Dillistone was educated at The Skinners' School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and Kent Institute of Art & Design, before gaining an honours degree at Staffordshire University, specialising in design and film production, where his lead tutor was John Jordan, sound recordist on Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Glory Film Co. Dillistone set up the company Glory Film Co. to make The Troop film with help from Paul-Anthony Viollet, a former King's Troop RHA officer. Cinematographer on The Troop was Alex Thomson (cinematographer). As a result of The Troop, with which Fujifilm collaborated, Dillistone was commissioned to make a series of films for worldwide release to demonstrate Fuji's new motion picture filmstocks. He employed cinematographers including: Oscar-winners Jack Cardiff and Ronnie Taylor, together with Phedon Papamichael, Geoff Boyle NSC FBKSTS, John de Borman, Sue Gibson, Thierry Arbogast, Ron Stanett, and Tony Pierce-Roberts. The films were shot at Pinewood and Shepperton studios, with locations including Hastings in East Sussex.

Hosted by The Lord's Taverners, and the First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Nigel Essenhigh; participating artists included Sir Roger Moore, Stephen Fry, Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, Lord Richard Attenborough, Juliet Mills, Hayley Mills, Richard Stilgoe, Sarah Miles, and Dame Kiri te Kanawa. Olympic Music Production Experience working on major musical recordings, including work with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, led to Dillistone being employed as Associate Producer Music for the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and closing ceremony. In December 2007, Dillistone was invited by the Governor of Luxor to screen a trailer of his latest film to the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the Prime Minister of Egypt, Ahmed Nazif. This was followed by an Invitation from the Jordanian Minister of Culture to present a film at the 2009 Jordan Festival in Amman. Icehotel In December 2010, Dillistone completed an Ice Suite for the world-famous Icehotel (Jukkasjärvi), working 200 km north of the Arctic Circle in Swedish Lappland at temperatures down to –40 °C. On 2 July 2013, Icehotel announced that he would return to the Arctic to complete a new creative concept: a London Underground tube terminus built entirely from snow and ice entitled \\"Mind the Gap (Last Stop on the Northern Line)\\".

Fish Stew) is a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade. The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the Yugoslav rock scene. Riblja Čorba was formed in 1978 by vocalist Bora Đorđević, guitarist Rajko Kojić, bass guitarist Miša Aleksić and drummer Vicko Milatović. Their debut release, the single \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist Momčilo Bajagić \\"Bajaga\\", the new lineup releasing the album Kost u grlu (1979), which was, largely due to Đorđević's social- related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, Pokvarena mašta i prljave strasti (1981), Mrtva priroda (1981) and Buvlja pijaca (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; Đorđević's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album Istina (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, Vidoja \\"Džindžer\\" Božinović and Nikola Čuturilo. Until the end of the decade and breakup of Yugoslavia, the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of Yugoslav wars it heavily declined in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to Đorđević's support for Serbian nationalism. However, Đorđević also opposed the regime of Slobodan Milošević, demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja Čorba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene, although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success. Band history =1970s: Formation and immediate rise to fame= The 1979—1984 Riblja Čorba lineup, from left to right: Miša Aleksić, Momčilo Bajagić, Vicko Milatović, Rajko Kojić and Bora Đorđević Riblja Čorba leader, Bora Đorđević, started performing and composing as a teenager. In his early bands he usually sang and played rhythm guitar. One of them, Poslednji Ostatak Romantičnog Sveta (The Last Remain of the Romantic World) featured Radomir \\"Točak\\" Mihajlović, who would later become the leader of Smak, on guitar. In the early 1970s, Đorđević played in Belgrade's Atelje 212 production of Jesus Christ Superstar and started his studies of theatre organization on the Belgrade Faculty of Dramatic Arts. At the same time, he formed the acoustic rock band Zajedno (Together), with which he recorded two 7\\" singles, the single \\"Vizija\\" (\\"Vision\\") bringing them certain media attention, and started contributing to Radio Belgrade show Veče uz radio (Evening by the Radio) and music magazine Džuboks, usually with reports on acoustic rock scene. In 1975, he left Zajedno, forming the acoustic band Suncokret, which soon gained media attention and popularity with their humorous folk rock-oriented songs. Đorđević spent three years in Suncokret, releasing the album Moje bube (My Bugs) and five 7\\" singles with the band. He decided to leave Suncokret in 1978, after the band refused to perform his new song, \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\" (\\"Doll from the Front Cover\\"), a ballad about a fame-hungry model, claiming the song does not fit into the band's style. Another Suncokret member, Biljana Krstić, decided to leave the band with Đorđević, and the two joined the pop rock band Rani Mraz, led by Đorđe Balašević. Đorđević, Balašević, Krstić and Verica Todorović would become the most famous Rani Mraz lineup. However, this lineup of the band lasted for only month and a half. In July 1978, Đorđević decided to leave the band. Đorđević decided to start cooperating with the members of the band SOS. The band, formed in 1972 by Miroslav \\"Miša\\" Aleksić (bass guitar), Dragan Štulović \\"Štuks\\" (guitar) and Steva Stevanović (drums), previously released three 7\\" singles and performed as the backing band for singer-songwriter Srđan Marjanović, but did not manage to gain larger attention. The band's debut album, Prvi poziv (First Call), which featured Đorđević as guest vocalist, was refused by all major record labels. In the summer of 1978, the band consisted of Aleksić, Miroslav \\"Vicko\\" Milatović (drums) and Radislav \\"Rajko\\" Kojić (guitar). Đorđević and SOS members made an agreement to form the band on August 15, 1978, in the kafana Šumatovac in Belgrade. The four intended to name the band Bora i Ratnici (Bora and the Warriors), Popokatepetl (Popocatépetl) or Riblja Čorba (Fish Stew, at the time the Belgrade slang for menstruation), but as the magazine Radio TV revija published a poster of the band with the name Riblja Čorba, the band decided to continue performing under that name. Riblja Čorba had its first concert in Elemir on September 8, 1978. In the first part of the concert, Aleksić, Kojić and Milatović performed Humble Pie, ZZ Top, Johnny Winter and Deep Purple covers, and in the second part they were joined by Đorđević, with whom they performed their songs and The Rolling Stones and Joe Cocker covers. In November, Radio Belgrade show Veče uz radio celebrated its anniversary with a large concert in Subotica Sports Hall. Riblja Čorba appeared on the concert playing only two songs but managed to win the audience's attention. They gained new fans at a fund raising concert in Sarajevo and the 1978 BOOM Festival held in Novi Sad. On December 22, they released their first single, \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\", which became an immediate hit. The song featured jazz trumpeter Stjepko Gut on piano. After the single release, Đorđević decided to leave acoustic guitar and dedicate himself to singing, and the members of the band considered adding a keyboardist to the lineup, but eventually decided to hire a rhythm guitarist. The band's new member became Momčilo Bajagić, at the time a high school student. He was recommended by Kojić, who previously played with Bajagić in the band Glogov Kolac (Wooden Stake). This lineup held its first concert on January 7, 1979, in Jarkovac; in the first part of the concert the band performed covers, and in the second part they performed their own songs, with Bajagić playing in the second part only. On February 28, they held a long promoted concert in Belgrade's Youth Center, which was the band's first concert in Belgrade. The concert featured ballerinas, students of former prima ballerina Minka Kamberović, and during the performance of \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\" Đorđević broke a mannequin to pieces. During that concert, Riblja Čorba played most of the songs which would be released on their first album. At the beginning of March, the band held several concerts in Macedonia, gaining new fans. Bajagić, still a high school student, managed to skip school by telling his teachers that he will be absent due to appendectomy. However, he got into trouble after one of the teachers saw a report on the tour in Politikin Zabavnik magazine, but ended up without suffering serious consequences. After, on the band's concert in Dolovo, Aleksić fell from the stage and broke his leg, he was replaced by Miroslav Cvetković (who would later become a member of Bajagić's band Bajaga i Instruktori) for the band's concerts in Sandžak. On these concerts, Cvetković also sang in the covers of foreign hits. On March 19, 1979, Riblja Čorba released their second single with the songs \\"Rock 'n' Roll za kućni savet\\" (\\"Rock 'n' Roll for Residents' Committee\\") and \\"Valentino iz restorana\\" (\\"Restaurant Valentino\\"). The lyrics for \\"Valentino iz restorana\\", with which the band appeared at the Opatija Festival, were co-written by Đorđević and Marina Tucaković, which was the only time in the history of the band that the author of the lyrics was someone outside the band. Riblja Čorba spent the summer in Makarska, where they practiced for the upcoming promotion of their debut album. The concert was held on September 1 on Belgrade's Tašmajdan Stadium. Although the album was at the time still unreleased, the stadium was sold out, thanks to large media attention and low ticket prices. Bulevar and Formula 4 performed as the opening bands. Riblja Čorba played all the songs which would be released on their debut album, the songs released on their 7\\" singles, and the covers of Joe Cocker's version of \\"The Letter\\" and The Rolling Stones' \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\". A huge surprise for the band members and the media was the fact that the audience knew all the lyrics; it was later revealed that the fans were recording Đorđević's radio interviews, during which parts of the songs were broadcast. This was the concert on which Đorđević, thanks to his stage charisma, got his concert nickname Bora Majstor (Bora the Master). Meri Cakić's \\"anti-ballet\\" group Ribetine (Chicks) also performed at the concert (Meri Cakić, who appeared on the concert wearing garter belts, has, by some claims, inspired Đorđević to write \\"Lutka sa naslovne strane\\", although he denied the claims). Several days later, Đorđević went to Doboj and Kojić went to Sarajevo, to serve in the Yugoslav People's Army. On November 28, the band, without Đorđević, performed in Sarajevo. Kojić was on his evening leave and performed wearing a uniform. Aleksić was on vocals, but, as he did not know all the lyrics, the audience was the one who sang most of the songs. This was the only time in Riblja Čorba's career when the band performed without Đorđević. Soon after, Aleksić went to Koprivnica to serve in the army, so the band's debut album was released during the group's hiatus. Riblja Čorba's debut album, Kost u grlu (Bone in the Throat), recorded during the summer of 1979 and produced by Enco Lesić, was released in September 1979. The album cover was designed by the cartoonist and a former Porodična Manufaktura Crnog Hleba member Jugoslav Vlahović, who would later design covers for most of Riblja Čorba albums released until the present day. The track \\"Još jedan šugav dan\\" (\\"Another Lousy Day\\") was originally titled \\"Još jedan usran dan\\" (\\"Another Shitty Day\\"), but Đorđević was persuaded by PGP-RTB editors to change the lyrics prior to recording. The song \\"Mirno spavaj\\" (\\"Sleep Tight\\") was written by Đorđević and Suncokret guitarist Nenad Božić during Đorđević's days in Suncokret, and was previously recorded for the SOS' Prvi poziv. PGP-RTB editors believed that the verse \\"Popij svoje sedative\\" (\\"Take your sedatives\\") from \\"Mirno spavaj\\" might have reminded of drug abuse, and the initial number of album copies, with the version of the song containing this verse, were soon retrieved from the stores; about 100 copies of the album with the original version of the song were sold, and are today considered a rarity. The album, featuring an edited version of \\"Mirno spavaj\\", soon reappeared in the stores. It was well received by fans and critics alike, mostly due to Đorđević's social-related lyrics. It brought a large number of hits: \\"Zvezda potkrovlja i suterena\\" (\\"Star of Attics and Basements\\"), \\"Egoista\\" (\\"Egoist\\"), \\"Ja sam još ona ista budala\\" (\\"I'm Still the Same Old Fool\\"), and \\"Ostani đubre do kraja\\" (\\"Remain Scum to the End\\"). Kost u grlu was sold in about 120,000 copies. Đorđević was proclaimed the Rock Musician of the Year by most of the music magazines, and Riblja Čorba's hard rock sound with blues elements was not perceived as archaic, although the age of new wave in Yugoslavia was about to begin. =Early 1980s: Nationwide popularity, Zagreb Ice Hall incident, political scandals= At the end of July 1980, Đorđević and Kojić, both still serving the army, appeared in Belgrade to record the song \\"Nazad u veliki prljavi grad\\" (\\"Back to the Big Dirty City\\") with Bajagić and Milatović. Đorđević was on a leave, and Kojić smuggled himself out of Sarajevo barracks. As Aleksić did not manage to get a leave, bass guitar on the song was played by Bajagić. After his return to Sarajevo, Kojić was sent to army jail for two weeks; although he managed to smuggle himself back into the barracks, his superior saw a photograph of the band sitting in kafana Šumatovac in a newspaper. \\"Nazad u veliki prljavi grad\\", recorded in one night, was released as a single on September 1, 1980. The B-side featured the original, uncensored version of \\"Mirno spavaj\\". After Đorđević and Aleksić returned from the army, the band held their comeback concert in Dadov Theater. They were announced as Zlatni Valovi Dunava (The Golden Waves of Danube), a lounge band which has been trying to sign a record contract for seven years. On the concert, the band performed new songs, written by Đorđević during his army service. In December, they were joined by Kojić, and on December 31 and January 1, they held two concerts with the hard rock band Atomsko Sklonište (Atomic Shelter). The concerts were held in Belgrade's Pionir Hall and were advertised as \\"Atomska Čorba\\" (Atomic Stew). In February 1981, Riblja Čorba released its second album, Pokvarena mašta i prljave strasti (Perverted Imagination and Sordid Passions). The album was produced by Enco Lesić, who also played keyboards on the album recording and composed the song \\"Rekla je\\" (\\"She Said\\"). The songs \\"Nemoj, srećo, nemoj danas\\" (\\"Don't, Honey, Not Today\\"), \\"Dva dinara, druže\\" (\\"Two Dinars, Comrade\\") and \\"Evo ti za taksi\\" (\\"Here's Some for the Cab\\") were composed by Bajagić; while in the army, Đorđević sent Bajagić the songs' lyrics, and was surprised to discover, upon his return, that Bajagić had written music on the lyrics. The original album cover was supposed to display a photograph of naked Mrs. Adela, an eighty-year-old model at the Belgrade Academy of Fine Arts. However, shortly before the album was released, Doživjeti stotu by Bijelo Dugme appeared, with a naked old woman on the three-piece cover, so the Pokvarena mašta i prljave strasti cover ended up featuring the writer Miloš Jovančević reading a porn magazine. The album brought a large number of hits: \\"Ostaću slobodan\\" (\\"I'll Stay Free\\"), \\"Lak muškarac\\" (\\"Easy Man\\"), \\"Evo ti za taksi\\", ballads \\"Neke su žene pratile vojnike\\" (\\"Some Women Escorted Soldiers\\"), \\"Nemoj srećo, nemoj danas\\" , \\"Dva dinara druže\\" and \\"Rekla je\\". By the end of 1981, the album was sold in more than 200,000 copies. The band promoted the album on a large Yugoslav tour, with 59 concerts. The beginning of the tour featured two concerts in Belgrade's Pionir Hall, with about 5,000 spectators per concert. The first concert was marked by an incident: the Hall's manager refused to turn of the lights in the Hall, fearing that the audience could \\"demolish the parquetry\\". The opening band, Papatra (which featured Miroslav Cvetković), performed under the lights switched on, but Đorđević refused to go out on the stage until the light are turned off. The efforts of the band, the Hall's management and the police to reach an agreement lasted for about an hour, and there was a danger from the angry audience's reactions, but, eventually, the management was persuaded to turn the lights off. At the end of June, they headlined a concert in Zagreb, which was organized by the newspaper Vjesnik and featured the most popular Yugoslav bands at the time. At that time, Aleksić got married so, for several concerts, he was once again replaced by Cvetković. During the tour, the band performed in Belgrade once again, on Kalemegdan. The concert featured guest appearance by Gillan bass guitarist John McCoy, who would produce the band's following album, on the cover of ZZ Top song \\"Tush\\". The concert featured about 10,000 spectators, and was, despite the fact that some of them got injured, praised by the press. In November, the band released their third studio album, Mrtva priroda (Still Life), produced by McCoy. Mrtva priroda was the first album which featured Bajagić's lyrics, in the song \\"Ja sam se ložio na tebe\\" (\\"I Had Hots for You\\"). It also brought Riblja Čorba's first openly political song, \\"Na zapadu ništa novo\\" (\\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\"). The album's main hits were \\"Volim, volim, volim, volim žene\\" (\\"I Love, Love, Love, Love Women\\"), \\"Pekar, lekar, apotekar\\" (\\"Baker, Doctor, Pharmacist\\"), \\"Ne veruj ženi koja puši Drinu bez filtera (Ostavi je)\\" (\\"Don't Trust a Woman that Smokes Non-Filter Drina (Leave Her)\\"), \\"Na zapadu ništa novo\\", \\"Neću da ispadnem životinja\\" (\\"I Don't Want to Be an Animal\\"). During the first week after its release, the album was sold in more than 100,000 copies, becoming the fastest-selling Yugoslav album, with the final number of copies sold being bigger than 450,000. Mrtva priroda confirmed the band's status as the most popular Yugoslav band. New Musical Express wrote about the band, stating that Riblja Čorba is \\"the most popular thing in Yugoslavia after Tito\\".\\"Knjiga Miše Aleksića iz \\"Riblje Čorbe\\"\\", blic.rs In January 1982, with a concert in Čačak, Riblja Čorba started their Yugoslav tour. The tour's slogan was \\"Ko preživi – pričaće\\" (\\"Those Who Survive Will Tell the Tale\\"), which would prove to be a very unfortunate title. For the band's concert in Zagreb Ice Hall, held on February 8, an initial number of 10,500 tickets was sold out, and the organizers decided to put an additional number of 4,500 tickets to sale, thus making the hall overcrowded. As only two exit doors were open, in the rush at the end of the concert a fourteen-year-old girl Željka Marković was trampled, dying of injuries. Part of the press publicly attacked Bora Đorđević, Riblja Čorba and rock music in general. On the rest of the tour, the organizers reduced the number of tickets, and some of the concerts were cancelled, as the organizers feared of new problems. This was also the time of the first political scandal that followed Riblja Čorba. At the beginning of February, Ilustrovana Politika magazine published a letter written by a teenager, who wrote about political suitability of Đorđević and Riblja Čorba. This caused SUBNOR (Union of Associations of Fighters in the War of Liberation) of Karpoš to demand Mrtva priroda to be banned because of the lyrics \\"Za ideale ginu budale\\" (\\"Fools get killed for ideals\\") and \\"Kreteni dižu bune i ginu\\" (\\"Jerks start uprisings and get killed\\") from the song \\"Na zapadu ništa novo\\". They were soon joined in their demands by SUBNORs of Sarajevo and Bezdan, as well as by League of Communist Youth of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The scandal saw large covering in the media, which had the effect on the concerts. The band had to cut short their concert in Celje, because the firemen appointed as security were aggressive towards the audience. The concert in Sarajevo was held only after Đorđević wrote explanations for the lyrics of the songs the band would perform and signed a liability waiver, stating that he would perform the song \\"Na zapadu ništa novo\\" on his own risk. The concert in Tuzla was canceled because, as the organizers stated, \\"order can not be guaranteed on a concert of a group actions of which are not in accordance with socialist morale\\". The scandal quieted down after Milo Dimitrijevski, the president of SUBNOR of Yugoslavia, publicly defended the band. Riblja Čorba ended the tour in April 1982, with four concerts in Belgrade's Pionir Hall. The concerts were held a month later than initially planned, as organizers hesitated due to Zagreb tragedy, fearing they might not be able to provide adequate security. The first of the concerts was not well visited, but the following three were, with a final number of tickets sold for the concerts being about 20,000. On the last of the concerts, held on April 11, the band recorded their first live album, U ime naroda (In the Name of the People), the title alluding to the political scandal around \\"Na zapadu ništa novo\\". On the Youth Day, the band was unexpectedly awarded with May Award by the Belgrade Committee of the League of Socialist Youth, with an explanation that the band \\"sings about the life and the problems of young people\\" and that \\"it has become a symbol of the large part of the youth\\". U ime naroda was released in July, selling 120,000 copies and becoming the best selling Yugoslav live album until then. Several days after the album release, Riblja Čorba, alongside Radomir Mihajlović \\"Točak\\", Aki Rahimovski and Električni Orgazam, performed on a large concert on the Square of Marx and Engels in Belgrade, organized as a sign of support for the Palestinian people. The band's following album, Buvlja pijaca (Flea Market), was released at the end of 1982. The producer was once again John McCoy, and the album was mixed in London. The album featured Kornelije Kovač as guest keyboardist. It featured softer sound than previous Riblja Čorba albums, with some of the songs featuring woodwind and bowed string instruments. The song \\"Baby, Baby, I Don't Wanna Cry\\" was the first Riblja Čorba song written entirely by Bajagić. Bajagić originally wrote the song for singer Slađana Milošević, but Đorđević insisted that the song should be recorded by Riblja Čorba. Buvlja pijaca brought a large number of successful songs: ironic love songs \\"Draga ne budi peder\\" (\\"Darling, Don't be a Faggot\\"), \\"U dva će čistači odneti đubre\\" (\\"At Two Garbage Collectors Will Collect the Trash\\"), \\"Dobro jutro\\" (\\"Good Morning\\"), and political songs \\"Ja ratujem sam\\" (\\"I'm Waging War Alone\\"), \\"Pravila, pravila\\" (\\"Rules, Rules\\"), \\"Kako je lepo biti glup\\" (\\"How Nice It Is to Be Stupid\\"), \\"Slušaj, sine, obriši sline\\" (\\"Listen Son, Wipe Your Nose\\"). However, the final number of copies sold was 250,000, which was less than expected by the band and the record company. Film director Mića Milošević would use most of the songs from the album in his 1982 film A Tight Spot. At this time, Đorđević was voted the Ideal Man by the readers of women magazine Bazar. As a sign of his appreciation, Đorđević wrote a joking poem \\"Domaćice, skinite gaćice, ja volim vaše flanelske spavaćice\\" (\\"Housewives, take off your panties, I love your flannel nightgowns\\"), which the magazine refused to publish. The band started a tour two weeks after the album release. However, the audience was less interested in their concerts than on the previous tours. The concerts in Croatia were organized by Scena revolucije (Revolution Scene), an organization of Croatian SUBNOR. The tour was ended with a concert in Belgrade Fair – Hall 1, which was the first concert in the hall after 1967 Belgrade Gitarijada festival. The concert was extensively promoted. Đorđević himself threw flyers over Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zrenjanin, Šabac and Pančevo, from a plane piloted by aviator and disc jockey Zoran Modli. The concert was entitled Hleba i igara (Bread and Games), and featured the biggest stage on a Yugoslav rock concert up to that point. The concert featured about 8,000 spectators. The opening bands on the concert were Dʼ Boys, Divlji Anđeli and Siluete, the latter performing with guitarist Nikola Čuturilo, who would later become a member of Riblja Čorba. As Milatović had to leave the band after the concert due to his army obligations, a barber cut his hair off on the stage. After the concert, Milatović left the band and was temporarily replaced by a former Tilt and Suncokret member Vladimir Golubović (who would later join Bajagić's band Bajaga i Instruktori). Prior to leaving to serve the army, Milatović started a side project: he formed the heavy metal band Ratnici (later known as Warriors) with the vocalist Dušan Nikolić, but recorded only an EP with them. After he went to serve the army, Warriors recorded their debut album without Milatović, moving to Canada after its release. A short break after the Buvlja pijaca tour was used by another two Riblja Čorba members for their side projects. Kojić released his solo EP Ne budi me bez razloga (Don't Wake Me Up Without a Good Reason), with lyrics written by Đorđević and Bajagić and featuring Đorđević and Golubović as guests. The EP also featured Nenad Stefanović \\"Japanac\\" on bass guitar and Laza Ristovski on keyboards. Bajagić worked on the songs for his upcoming solo album, but found time to write several songs for Riblja Čorba's next album. =Mid 1980s: The crisis and decline in popularity, lineup change and comeback= At the end of 1983, Riblja Čorba represented Yugoslavia on an international youth festival in Bulgaria. The title of the festival was The Balkans – A Zone without Nuclear weapons. The band held four concerts, the first one, in Plovdiv, attended only by young socialist activists with special invitations, forced by security to remain on their seats throughout the whole concert. On the closing ceremony, the band performed after Greek folk dancers, Bulgarian rhythm dancers and Romanian youth theatre, which performed the play Specter of Capitalism Attacks the Youth of the East. Prior to the concert, the band was asked by the organizers not to perform the song \\"Kako je lepo biti glup\\". Riblja Čorba's fifth studio album, Večeras vas zabavljaju muzičari koji piju (Tonight You Will Be Entertained by Musicians Who Drink), was released in 1984. As Riblja Čorba's record label PGP-RTB refused to pay for the recording in London, the band signed a contract with PGP-RTB's main competitor, Jugoton. However, the album ended up being recorded in Ljubljana and mixed in London. It was produced by Kornelije Kovač. Immediately after the album was released, state's censors declared songs \\"Mangupi vam kvare dete\\" (\\"Bad Boys Are Spoiling Your Kid\\") and \\"Besni psi\\" (\\"Rabid Dogs\\") \\"ethically unsuitable\\". The censors labeled the album as kitsch, which meant the price of it had to be higher than the normal record price. \\"Besni psi\\" even caused an international scandal. Because of the lyrics \\"Grčki šverceri, arapski studenti, negativni elementi, maloletni delikventi i besni psi\\". (\\"Greek smugglers, Arab students, negative elements, juvenile delinquents and rabid dogs\\"), embassys of three Arab countries and Zaire protested because, in their words, \\"Đorđević equated foreign students and rabid dogs\\", and the Yugoslav Ministry of Culture demanded an analysis of the song by the experts. Prior to the promotional concert in Belgrade, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded from the band not to perform the song. Večeras vas zabavljaju muzičari koji piju was not as nearly successful as Riblja Čorba's previous albums. Đorđević's dark, depressive lyrics were disliked by the critics, and the album's only hit was the gentle ballad \\"Kad hodaš\\" (\\"When You Walk\\"), written by Bajagić. In the spring of 1984, Bajagić's solo album Pozitivna geografija (Positive Geography) was released, and was very well received by fans and critics alike. Bajagić and the musicians he recorded Pozitivna geografija with promoted the album with a well-attended concert in Belgrade's Dom Sindikata, after which they got a large number of offers from concert organizers. On the other hand, Riblja Čorba spring tour was unsuccessful. Eight concerts were canceled due to lack of interest, and the concert in Pionir Hall was not well attended. The tour revealed the crisis and brought conflicts inside the band. Đorđević and Aleksić started turning towards alcohol, and Kojić was already a heroin addict. After Kojić failed to appear on two television appearances of the band, on several occasions left the band during the tour and had a car accident, Đorđević and Aleksić decided to exclude him from the band. Bajagić, however, insisted that Kojić remains a member, so Đorđević and Aleksić changed their decision. The band went on a summer break. However, they were soon offered 50,000 dollars by a hotel owner from Thessaloniki for summer performances. Đorđević phoned Bajagić, who was at the time on his vacation on Mljet, but Bajagić refused to return, explaining that, after his vacation, he had planned concerts on youth work actions with his new band, Bajaga i Instruktori. Kojić too refused to perform in Greece, and Đorđević and Aleksić decided to exclude both of them from the band. These events got large attention in the press. Both Bajaga and Kojić found out that they were excluded from the band from the papers. Bajagić would continue his career as the leader of highly successful pop rock band Bajaga i Instruktori, while Kojić would retire from music, dying in 1997. Džindžer Božinović, shown here in 2007, joined Riblja Čorba in 1984 after Bajagić and Rajko Kojić left and has remained the band's lead guitarist ever since. Riblja Čorba's new guitarists became Vidoja \\"Džindžer\\" Božinović, formerly of Pop Mašina, Dah, Opus and Rok Mašina, and Zoran Dašić, formerly of Šamar. Soon after, Milatović returned from the army and rejoined Riblja Čorba, while Golubović moved to Bajagić's Bajaga i Instruktori. After only five rehearsals, Dašić had to leave the band due to family obligations. (Dašić would later form the starogradska muzika band Legende, and Đorđević would write lyrics for seven and music for two songs released on their debut album.) He was replaced by Nikola Čuturilo. Before he joined Riblja Čorba, Čuturilo was a member of the bands Kredit (which would later evolve into Laki Pingvini), Bicikl, Zamba, Siluete, and, for only couple of months, Električni Orgazam. The band spent the autumn of 1984 performing mostly in clubs, firming their sound and practicing for the recording of the new album. On the last evening of Belgrade Summer Festival, on September 20, 1984, the band performed in Belgrade Youth Center, the concert being announced as a performance of the band called Debeli Bogoljub i Ljuti Tezgaroši (Fat Bogoljub and Old Moonlighters). At this time, Đorđević made a guest appearance on the 1984 self-titled album by Bijelo Dugme, Riblja Čorba's main competitors at the time. Đorđević appeared on the song \\"Pediculis Pubis\\" (misspelling of \\"Pediculosis pubis\\"), having co-written it with Bijelo Dugme leader Goran Bregović and singing it with Bregović and Mladen Vojičić \\"Tifa\\". This guest appearance helped Riblja Čorba's shattered status. In the winter, the band entered the studio to record their next album. The band's sixth studio album, Istina (The Truth), was released in 1985. Prior to album release, the band promoted it on their performance in the club Kulušić in Zagreb. The album was produced by McCoy, and recorded by Ratko Ostojić and Goran Vejvoda. Goran Bregović returned the guest appearance by singing with Đorđević in the song \\"Disko mišić\\" (\\"Disco Muscle\\"). As Jugoton refused to release the songs \\"Snage opozicije\\" (\\"Opposition Forces\\"), \\"Pogledaj dom svoj, anđele\\" (\\"Look Homeward, Angel\\"), \\"'Alo\\" (\\"Hello\\") and \\"Dvorska budala\\" (\\"Jester\\") because of their political-related lyrics, the band signed back with PGP-RTB, which refused to release only \\"Snage opozicije\\". After most of the newspapers published the lyrics of \\"Snage opozicije\\", the band gave up the idea to release it as a self-released single. (The song remained unreleased until 1997, when it appeared on the compilation album Treći srpski ustanak.) However, Đorđević had to replace the lyrics \\"S planine šakal zavija, tamo je Jugoslavija\\" (\\"A jackal is howling from the mountain, over there is Yugoslavia\\") from the song \\"'Alo\\" with \\"Ja iz dalekih predela posmatram tuđa nedela\\" (\\"From the faraway lands I'm watching their misdeeds\\"). Although after Večeras vas zabavljaju muzičari koji piju many critics claimed that Riblja Čorba belongs to the past, Istina was praised by both fans and critics. It represented the band's triumphant comeback, mostly thanks to the song \\"Pogledaj dom svoj, anđele\\", and is often considered Riblja Čorba's magnum opus. On the Bosnian winter tour that followed the album release and featured concerts in small town Bileća and villages Donja Mahala, Matuzići and Tišina, the former YU Grupa bass guitarist Žika Jelić replaced Aleksić, who was not able to perform due to illness. At the time, Jelić was 42, Đorević was 32, and Čuturilo was 22. In May, the band held a successful concert in Belgrade Sports Hall, and Đorđević released his first book of poems entitled Ravnodušan prema plaču (Apathetic towards Crying). In a month, 10,000 copies of the book were sold. =Late 1980s: New successes and political scandals= In February 1986, the band released their eight studio album, Osmi nervni slom (Eighth Nervous Breakdown). The album was produced by Kornelije Kovač. It featured British reggae musician Eddy Grant on vocals in the song \\"Amsterdam\\". Grant was, after his concert in Belgrade, persuaded by Riblja Čorba members to come to the studio and sing two strophes of the song. Other guests included saxophonist Jova Maljoković, on the song \\"Jedan čovek\\" (\\"One Man\\"), and actress and Bastion vocalist Ana Kostovska, on the song \\"Prokleto sam\\" (\\"So Damn Alone\\"). The album's biggest hits were \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Nemoj da ideš mojom ulicom\\" (\\"Don't Walk Along My Street\\"). The political songs \\"Tu nema Boga, nema pravde\\" (\\"There's no God, There's no Justice\\") and \\"Južna Afrika '85. (Ja ću da pevam)\\" (\\"South Africa '85 (\\"I'm Gonna Sing)\\"), although no more explicit than songs from previous Riblja Čorba albums, had a hard time finding the way to the listeners because of the radio editors' self-censorship. At the beginning of 1986, Đorđević's lyrics were even discussed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's Committee for Informative and Propaganda Actions. Political dilemmas did not affect the audience: on March 8, with a concert in Sarajevo's Skenderija, which featured some 10,000 spectators, Riblja Čorba started their most successful tour since the Mrtva priroda tour. At the end of March, they sold out Pionir Hall for the first time in four years, confirming their return to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene. During the same year, Milatović released his first solo album, U ritmu srca malog dobošara (In the Rhythm of the Little Drummer Boy's Heart). The album was produced by Kovač, and featured songs written by Milatović during Mrtva priroda and Ratnici - Warriors sessions. At the 1986 MESAM Festival, the band was awarded with the Rock Band of the Year Award, Đorđević was proclaimed Composer of the Year, and \\"Amsterdam\\" was proclaimed Hit of the Year. In February 1987, they released their ninth studio album, Ujed za dušu (Soul Bite). The album was produced by Kovač, and featured the band's first cover, \\"Zadnji voz za Čačak\\" (\\"Last Train to Čačak\\", cover of The Monkees' \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\"). Surprisingly, the album did not feature political lyrics, with the exception of \\"Član mafije\\" (\\"Mafia Member\\"), a Caribbean music-inspired song in which Đorđević humorously described the League of Communists of Yugoslavia as mafia. The songs \\"Nesrećnice nije te sramota\\" (\\"Miserable Woman, Aren't You Ashamed\\") and \\"Zašto kuče arlauče\\" (\\"Why the Dog Howls\\") were released on a 7\\" single, which was given as a gift to the buyers of the first 1,000 copies of the album. On July 19, the band, alongside Parni Valjak, Leb i Sol and Đorđe Balašević, performed at Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb at the 1987 Summer Universiade closing ceremony.\\"Univerzijada '87: Na svečanom zatvaranju nastupaju Balašević, Parni valjak, Leb i sol...\\", Yugopapir.com Đorđević's 1987 unplugged performance with singer-songwriter Arsen Dedić in Terazije Theatre resulted in a famous bootleg album Arsen & Bora Čorba Unplugged '87. The performance featured Stjepan Mihaljinec on piano and Božinović and Čuturilo on guitars. In 1987, Đorđević was indicted for \\"disturbing the public\\", when he read his poems on Studio B's anniversary celebration in Sava Centar. However, the court dismissed the prosecution's charges, as Đorđević was reading poems already published in his books and in various magazines. In 1988, after reading his poems in Bar, he was, after accusations of a policeman who was present, indicted for \\"insulting the working people of Yugoslavia\\", but these charges were, after a longer process, dropped. In 1988, Đorđević released Bora priča gluposti (Bora's Talking Rubbish), which featured a recording of his poetry evening held in Belgrade's Engineering Students' Club. During the same year, he was accepted to the Association of Writers of Serbia, after writing his application on a table napkin. In 1988, Riblja Čorba celebrated ten years of existence by releasing Priča o ljubavi obično ugnjavi (Talking about Love Is Usually Annoying), produced by Kovač, and the compilation album Riblja Čorba 10, which was released in a limited number of 1,000 copies only, and was given to the friends of the band and the media. The anniversary concert in Belgrade Fair featured some 15,000 spectators. Prior to the concert, the band had an intention to hold a fund raising concert in front of the Church of Saint Sava, with all the funds raised dedicated to the construction of the church, with Đorđe Balašević, Ekatarina Velika and Piloti as special guests, but did not get permission from the police to organize it. Although the situation in the country became more dramatic, the album did not feature many political-related songs. During these couple of years, Čuturilo started composing and writing lyrics for acts like Dejan Cukić, YU Grupa and Kerber, and, in 1988, he released his first solo album 9 lakih komada (9 Easy Pieces). After releasing his second studio album, Raskršće (Crossroads), in 1989, he decided to leave the band and dedicate himself to his solo career. The band held their last concert with Čuturilo on October 14, 1989, in Sarajevo. He was replaced by Zoran Ilić, a former Bezobrazno Zeleno member. In 1990, the band released Koza nostra (transliteration for Cosa Nostra, but also a word play, with \\"Koza\\" meaning \\"goat\\" in Serbian). The album was produced by Saša Habić. It featured Branimir Štulić and Azra members on backing vocals, on the track \\"Al Kapone\\" (\\"Al Capone\\"), former Suncokret members Bilja Krstić, Gorica Popović and Snežana Jandrlić on backing vocals, and Bajaga i Instruktori member Saša Lokner on keyboards. The album included a cover of Chuck Berry's song \\"Memphis, Tennessee\\", Riblja Čorba version entitled \\"Crna Gora, Bar\\" (\\"Montenegro, Bar\\"), \\"Baby\\" which Đorđević, by his claims, wrote when he was 13, and \\"Tito je vaš\\" (\\"Tito Is Yours\\"), one of the first Yugoslav rock songs to openly ridicule late Josip Broz Tito. After the album release, the band performed in Sweden, Romania and Australia. In Romania, they performed, alongside Bajaga i Instruktori, Galija, Valentino and Viktorija, in Timișoara, at the three-day concerts organized two months after the Romanian Revolution. All five acts performed on three concerts in Timișoara Olympia Hall in front of some 20,000 people each night. =1990s: Riblja Čorba during war years and Milošević's regime= After the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars in 1991, Riblja Čorba members decided to record their farewell album. Labudova pesma (Swan Song) was recorded in Vienna at the end of 1991. Oliver Mandić, a highly successful pop rock singer and composer, cooperated with the band on the recording. The idea was for Mandić to become a full-time member of the band, but, due to disagreements between him and Đorđević, the cooperation was ended, and three songs composed by him did not appear on the album. Labudova pesma, which did not turn out to be Riblja Čorba's last album, as they eventually changed their decision to disband, featured only one hit, \\"Kad sam bio mlad\\" (\\"When I Was Young\\", cover of Eric Burdon's \\"When I Was Young\\"), and was generally disliked by the critics, starting the series of Riblja Čorba albums with little critical acclaim. During 1992, Zoran Ilić formed the comedy rock supergroup Babe with Bajaga i Instruktori member Žika Milenković, Električni Orgazam member Goran Čavajda and a former Bezobrazno Zeleno member Zoran Vasić. The next Riblja Čorba album Zbogom, Srbijo (Farewell, Serbia), released in 1993, was not very successful either. Except the ballad \\"Jedino moje\\" (\\"My Only One\\"), \\"Zelena trava doma mog\\" (\\"Green Grass of My Home\\", a cover of Curly Putman's \\"Green Green Grass of Home\\"), \\"Danas nema mleka\\" (\\"No Milk Today\\", a heavy metal cover of Herman's Hermits' \\"No Milk Today\\") and \\"Tamna je noć\\" (\\"Dark Is the Night\\", a cover of Mark Bernes' \\"Tyomnaya noch\\"), the other songs from the album remained unnoticed. After the album release, Vlada Barjaktarević, a former Van Gogh member, who worked with the band on the album, became the band's first keyboard player. At this time, Đorđević became an active supporter of Serbian nationalism.\\"30 godina Riblje Čorbe\\", popboks.com With Knin band Minđušari he recorded controversial song \\"E moj druže zagrebački\\" (\\"Oh, my Zagreb Comrade\\"), as a response to Jura Stublić's song \\"E moj druže beogradski\\" (\\"Oh, my Belgrade Comrade\\"). This had closed the door to Riblja Čorba in Croatian and Bosnian mainstream media and caused Riblja Čorba to lose a part of their fans in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Đorđević's support for Serbian nationalism did not, however, imply support for the government of Slobodan Milošević, and he would express his attitude in Riblja Čorba political songs recorded on the band's following albums, as well as on the 1996 album Njihovi dani (Their Days), which was recorded by Riblja Čorba, but which he released in his own name rather than that of his band. The song \\"Baba Jula\\" (\\"Grandma Yula\\"), which alluded to Mirjana Marković, became one of the anthems of 1996–1997 protests in Serbia. In the summer of 1996, Riblja Čorba performed in Republika Srpska, on Serb Democratic Party rallies. The band performed without Ilić, and it was then when it was announced that he is not a member of the band anymore. Ilić was not replaced, and the band continued their activity with one guitarist only. The album Ostalo je ćutanje (The Rest Is Silence), released in 1996, featured a cover of John Lennon's song \\"Jealous Guy\\", Riblja Čorba version titled \\"Ljubomorko\\" (\\"Jealous Guy\\"), and the song \\"Odlazi od mene, ubico, idi\\" (\\"Go Away from Me, Murderer, Leave\\"), originally recorded for a production of Moscow-Petushki. The latter was sung by former Suncokret female singers Biljana Krstić, Snežana Jandrlić and Gorica Popović, being the only Riblja Čorba song not sung by Đorđević. The album was followed by concerts across Canada, Australia and Europe. During the same year, Milatović started his second side project, the hard rock band Indijanci (Indians). The band's debut, self-titled album, released in 1997 and featuring guest appearance by Rajko Kojić (which was his last recording), was, mostly due to simply lyrics, panned by the critics. At the beginning of 1997, a compilation album Treći srpski ustanak (Third Serbian Uprising), with a selection of Riblja Čorba political songs, was released. The album featured previously unreleased \\"Snage opozicije\\" and one new song \\"Volim i ja vas\\" (\\"I Love You, Too\\"), written during the 1996–97 protests. In 1997, the band held a tour named \\"Po slobodnim gradovima Srbije\\" (\\"Around the Free Cities of Serbia\\"), as the bands performed in cities in which Socialist Party of Serbia was not in power, which culminated with two concerts in Tašmajdan, on May 31 and June 1, with Rambo Amadeus, Babe, Prljavi Inspektor Blaža i Kljunovi, Direktori, Indijanci, Aleluja, and Kraljevski Apartman as the opening acts. On these two concerts Riblja Čorba recorded live albums Beograd, uživo '97 - 1 and Beograd, uživo '97 - 2. (Belgrade, Live 97 – 1 and 2). On December 22, 1997, the band was scheduled to hold a concert in Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana, however, the Slovenian authorities refused to issue visas to the members of the band because of Đorđević's political statements. At the beginning of 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Riblja Čorba recorded the patriotic tune \\"Samo Sloga Srbina Spašava\\" (\\"Only Unity Saves the Serbs\\") with Bajagić, Dejan Cukić, Van Gogh frontman Zvonimir Đukić and Generacija 5 frontman Đorđe David. In June of the same year, Milatović decided to leave Riblja Čorba and move to Australia, but soon changed his mind and returned to the band; the band had only one concert without him, in Zürich, Switzerland, with former Piloti member Zoran \\"Ćera\\" Obradović on drums.Riblja Čorba biography by Vicko Milatović In November 1999, Riblja Čorba released Nojeva barka (Noah's Ark), produced by Aleksić and Miša Popović. Album featured a cover of Merle Travis' \\"Sixteen Tons\\", Riblja Čorba version titled \\"16 noći\\" (\\"16 Nights\\"). The song \\"Gde si\\" (\\"Where Are You\\") was composed by Momčilo Bajagić, who also made a guest appearance on the song. Thealbum also featured Branko Marušić \\"Čutura\\" (harmonica), Mirko Tomić (pedal steel guitar), Srđan Đoković (trumpet) and Slavolub Kolarević (saxophone). =2000s= Bora Đorđević in concert, in Belgrade Arena in 2009 In 2000, Đorđević took an active role in Democratic Opposition of Serbia rallies preceding the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević.Uporno dozivanje anđela: \\"Kabaretisti misle srcem\\", Youtube The band's first album after political changes was Pišanje uz vetar (Pissing Against the Wind), produced by Aleksić and Milan Popović and released in 2001. \\"Crno-beli svet\\" (\\"Black and White World\\") was a duet sung by Đorđević and Eyesburn frontman Hornsman Coyote, who also played the trombone on the song. The other guests on the album included Dejan Cukić on backing vocals, Vidoja Božinović's brother Zoran Božinović on guitar, actor Josif Tatić, who recited in the song \\"Čekajući čoveka\\" (\\"Waiting for a Man\\"), Boban Marković Trumpet Orchestra, and others. In 2002, after the tour following the album release, Barjaktarević left the band and was replaced by Nikola Zorić, a graduate from the Belgrade Music Academy.\\"Nikola Zorić, 'Kontrast': 'Najbitniji su iskrenost i ljubav prema muzici'\\", nadlanu.com In 2003, Riblja Čorba released Ovde (Here), with songs \\"Zašto uvek kurcu sviram\\" and \\"Pičkin dim\\" released on the bonus CD. The album saw little success, with the ballad \\"Poslednja pesma o tebi\\" (\\"The Last Song About You\\") becoming the album's only hit. The recording featured Dejan Cukić, Bilja Krstić, Đorđe David and other guests. On December 20, Riblja Čorba, alongside Orthodox Celts, performed in Belgrade's Engineering Students' Club, but Riblja Čorba performance was interrupted due to a bomb threat. During the same year, Milatović released his second solo album, a children's music album entitled Dečaci o devojčicama (Boys about Girls), which featured Đorđević, Bajagić, Žika Milenković (of Bajaga i Instruktori and Babe), Dejan Cukić, Zvonimir Đukić \\"Đule\\" (of Van Gogh), Igor Blažević \\"Blaža\\" (of Prljavi Inspektor Blaža i Kljunovi), Miodrag \\"Pile\\" Živanović (of Alisa), Đorđe David and Billy King as guest vocalists.Dečaci o devojčicama at Discogs On July 3, 2004, Riblja Čorba, alongside the Belgrade faction of the band Zabranjeno Pušenje, held a concert at the Belgrade Ušće, to celebrate Riblja Čorba's twenty-five and Zabranjeno Pušenje's twenty years on the scene. The concert featured a large number of opening acts, including Negative, Prljavi Inspektor Blaža i Kljunovi, Bjesovi, Alogia, Roze Poze, Abonos, Kraljevski Apartman and Đorđe David. However, the concert is best remembered by the fact that Zabranjeno Pušenje performed their world music-oriented material they recorded as The No Smoking Orchestra, which provoked the fans who throw various objects on stage, forcing the band to end their performance after only half an hour. At the half of the 2000s, the members of the band came up with an idea of releasing a studio album in three parts, as three separate EPs. The first part of the album Trilogija (Trilogy), Trilogija 1: Nevinost bez zaštite (Trilogy 1: Virginity without Protection) was released in 2005, and the second and the third, Trilogija 2: Devičanska ostrva (Trilogy 2: Virgin Islands) and Trilogija 3: Ambasadori loše volje (Trilogy 3: Badwill Ambassadors) were released in 2006. On March 10, 2007, the band held a concert in Belgrade Arena.\\"Raspevani skandal-majstor\\", poltika.rs The concert featured Radio Television of Serbia Symphony Orchestra and Obilić Academic Choir, both conducted by Vojkan Borisavljević.Gladijatori u BG Areni at Discogs On the concert, Đorđević jokingly introduced the members of the band as convicts and fugitives indicted for war crimes: Nikola Zorić as Veselin Šljivančanin, Miša Aleksić as Biljana Plavšić, Vicko Milatović as Milorad Ulemek \\"Legija\\", Vidoja Božinović as Ratko Mladić, and himself as Radovan Karadžić; the introduction of Milatović as Ulemek was much criticized by the Serbian public.\\"TADIĆ NE ZASLUŽUJE KOŠTUNIČINU PODRŠKU\\", mc.rs The recording of the concert was released on the album Gladijatori u BG Areni (Gladiators in BG Arena), both in a live album and video album version.

Minut sa njom was the first Riblja Čorba album since Pokvarena mašta i prljave strasti which did not feature any song with political-related lyrics.

Agile was laid down on 22 February 1954 at Stamford, Connecticut, by the Luders Marine Construction Co. as AM-421; redesignated MSO-421 on 7 February 1955; launched on 19 November 1955; sponsored by Mrs. Alice Donohue; and commissioned at the New York Naval Shipyard on 21 June 1956, Lt. Herbert D. Mills, Jr., in command.  Initial training period  The non-magnetic ocean minesweeper completed fitting out at New York and then sailed on 13 July for her home port, Charleston, South Carolina. She remained there for about two weeks before getting underway on 31 July for her shakedown training. Agile operated out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, between 8 August and 6 September and returned to Charleston on the 10th of the latter month. Type training and post-shakedown availability at the Charleston Naval Shipyard followed. The beginning of 1957 found her still at Charleston, but preparing to embark upon her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea.  First Atlantic crossing  Agile began her first Atlantic Ocean crossing on 12 February 1957, transited the Strait of Gibraltar on the 26th and cruised with the U.S. 6th Fleet for three months. During that time, the ship participated in two amphibious exercises and visited several Mediterranean ports. Among her ports of call were Patras and Athens on the Greek mainland; the Greek islands of Samos, Rhodes, and Crete and Cannes, France. The crisis in Jordan in April kept her in the eastern portion of the Mediterranean for most of her first deployment. After turnover at Rhodes, Agile began the long voyage home on 25 May; and she re-entered Charleston with her division mates on 16 June. Post- deployment leave and upkeep occupied the ensuing five weeks. On 26 July, the minesweeper got underway for Little Creek, Virginia, to participate in harbor defense and minesweeping exercises. However, damage to her propeller forced her into repairs at the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. and precluded her participation in the exercises. The repairs ended on 25 September, and the warship departed Newport News, Virginia, that same day. Returning to Charleston five days later, she spent the bulk of October conducting acoustic trials out of her home port.  Engaged in testing  On 26 October the minesweeper stood out of Charleston on her way to Panama City, Florida, where she reported on the 31st for duty with the Mine Defense Laboratory. She assisted the laboratory in the conduct of special mine defense tests for five weeks completed that service on 5 December 1957, and headed back to Charleston. December brought the usual year's-end holiday leave period. The New Year, 1958, began with a two-week availability alongside a tender February saw Agile pass her final acceptance trials and an operational readiness inspection. On 17 February the minesweeper entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul. She completed repairs by June and began duty with the shipyard testing propeller blades. During July and August, the warship conducted refresher and type training. September brought preparations for overseas movement.  Second Med cruise  Agile put to sea on 29 September 1958, bound for her second tour of duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet. Port calls and exercises - notably an amphibious landing exercise carried out on the southern coast of Sardinia highlighted that deployment in the Mediterranean. She passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 26 January 1959 and began the return voyage to the United States. En route home, the warship made a brief stop at Bermuda before re-entering Charleston on 11 February. Between the time of her return and the beginning of summer, the warship carried out tests and conducted minesweeping operations out of Charleston. By the beginning of the second week in August, she was working with the Mine Warfare School as a training platform. That service lasted until she began her holiday leave period in December 1959  1960 NATO exercises  The minesweeper entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard on 29 January 1960 and began a regular overhaul. She completed overhaul on 5 April and, the following month, conducted postoverhaul refresher training and minesweeping exercises. On 28 June, Agile joined her division mates in deploying to the West Indies. After a round of port visits and exercises, she returned to Charleston on 13 September. Later that month, the minesweeper moved north to Nova Scotia where she participated in Operation Sweepclear V, a NATO minesweeping exercise. Atlantic coast operations continued into 1961 when she began preparations for her third deployment to the Mediterranean. Agile departed Charleston on 10 April 1961 in company with the other ships of her division. They arrived at Rota, Spain, on 25 April and took on fuel before entering the Mediterranean. For the next five months' Agile plied the waters of the \\"middle sea\\" showing the flag and honing her combat skills. She participated in two 6th Fleet amphibious exercises as well as the NATO Exercise \\"Checkmate\\". She and her division mates were relieved at Pollença Bay, Majorca, on 28 September and began the long voyage home. The return passage ended at Charleston on 14 October.  1962 Caribbean operations  Following post-deployment standdown, the minesweeper entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard in mid-November for regular overhaul. She left the shipyard in January 1962 and after refresher training, resumed operations out of Charleston with the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force. Until the beginning of May Agile conducted independent ship's exercises, type training, and training missions for the Mine Warfare School. On 2 May, she departed Charleston, bound for Panama City, Florida. For a little more than a month, the warship performed service in support of experiments and tests conducted by the Naval mine Defense Laboratory. She returned to Charleston on 8 June, began preparations for a deployment to the West Indies, and embarked upon that assignment on 20 July. The minesweeper made port visits participated in an amphibious exercise at Vieques Island, and joined other American ships off Haiti for a show of force during another of that country's frequent periods of internal disorder.  1963 NATO exercises  Agile returned to Charleston on 9 November, underwent two weeks of repairs alongside a tender, and then finished out the year with post-deployment standdown followed by holiday leave and upkeep. On 8 January 1963, she put to sea for a fleet service mine test which ended on the 25th. At that point, the ship resumed normal operations out of Charleston, providing services to the Mine Warfare School as well as conducting the usual independent ship's exercises and type training. Between 4 and 25 May, she participated in the NATO Exercise \\"Sweepclear VIII\\", in the vicinity of Mayport, Florida. Six weeks of local operations out of Charleston followed. On 5 July, the minesweeper departed her home port once again, bound for Little Creek, Virginia, where she provided services to the Operational Test and Evaluation Force. She returned to Charleston on 25 July and, after a two-week tender availability, resumed local operations. On 29 October, the vessel entered the yard at the Charleston Drydock & Shipbuilding Co. for a two-month overhaul.  1964 Med cruise  The warship completed the repair period on 3 January 1964 Local operations and refresher training filled her time until the last week in March. Beginning on 22 March she spent three weeks as a school ship for the Mine Warfare School. Following that duty, the ship once more began preparations to deploy to the Mediterranean. She departed Charleston on 15 May and reported in at Málaga, Spain, on 3 June. In addition to the usual exercises and port visits, Agile participated in a cruise to northern Europe. She left the Mediterranean on 17 July and visited ports in England, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and France. the minesweeper retransited the Strait of Gibraltar on 17 September and resumed duty with the 6th Fleet. Relieved of duty at Huelva, Spain, she headed back to the United States on 29 October. Agile arrived back in Charleston on 17 November and began a post-deployment tender availability that lasted a month. The remainder of the year brought holiday leave and upkeep  Final services to the fleet  The 1964 Mediterranean cruise proved to be the last of her career. During the remainder of her active service, some seven years and six months, Agile served in waters near North America. She deployed to the West Indies and to the Gulf of Mexico several times but, otherwise, conducted local operations out of Charleston. At various times, the minesweeper served as a school ship for the Mine Warfare School and as a test platform for both the Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida, and the Naval Ordnance Facility at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In between those special assignments, the warship engaged in independent ship's exercises and type training.  Decommissioning  Those activities came to an end, however, on 28 July 1972 when Agile was placed out of commission at Charleston. Later that year she was moved to a permanent berthing area with the Norfolk Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. There she remained for more than seven years. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in September 1977, and she was sold to the Union Minerals & Alloys Corp. in February 1980 for scrapping.

History and archaeology =Antiquity= According to Josephus, the original name of the town was Shomron, before King Herod renamed it in honor of Augustus Caesar.Josephus, Antiquities (Book xv, chapter 246). The Greek sebastos, \\"venerable\\", translates the Latin epithet augustus. According to the Hebrew Bible it was settled by several Israelite tribes, \\"in ancient times.\\"Omri, king of the 10 tribes of Israel, built the city and settled his men in the Old City, in accordance with the account relayed in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 16:24).

See also: The Augusteum at Samaria-Sebaste The ancient site of Samaria-Sebaste is located just above the built up area of the modern day village on the eastern slope of the hill. The ruins dominate the hillside and comprise remains from six successive cultures dating back more than 10,000 years: Canaanite, Israelite, Hellenistic, Herodian, Roman and Byzantine. The city was destroyed by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE, and was destroyed again by John Hyrcanus in 108 BCE.Sebaste, Holy Land Atlas Travel and Tourism Agency. Pompey rebuilt the town in the year 63 BCE. In 27 BCE, Augustus Caesar gave it to Herod the Great.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (Wars of the Jews) i.xx.§3 Herod expanded and renovated the city, bringing in six-thousand new inhabitants, and named it \\"Sebaste\\", meaning \\"Augustus\\", in the Emperor's honor.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (Wars of the Jews) i.xxi.§2 Herod the Great had his sons Alexander and Aristobulus brought to Sebaste, and strangled in 7 BCE after a trial in Berytus and with the approbation of Caesar.Josephus Flavius Antiquities book 16 chapter 11 para 7 Sherds from the late Roman,Zertal, 2004, pp. 463-464 Byzantine,Dauphin, 1998, pp. 766–7 Early Moslem and Medieval eras have been found here. =Medieval period= Sebastia was the seat of a bishop in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the writings of Yaqut al- Hamawi (1179–1229), the Syrian geographer, who situates it as part of the Filastin Province of Syria, located two days from that city, in the Nablus District. He also writes, \\"There are here the tombs of Zakariyyah and Yahya, his son, and of many other prophets and holy men.\\"Le Strange, 1890, p. 523. =Ottoman era= Sebastia from the 1871-77 PEF Survey of Palestine Sebastia was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Jabal Sami, part of Sanjak Nablus. It had a population of 20 households and 3 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, occasional revenues, goats and/or beehives; a total of 5,500 akçe.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 129 The French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village in 1870 and found it to have less than a thousand inhabitants.Guérin, 1875, pp. 188–96 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Sebastia as \\"A large and flourishing village, of stone and mud houses, on the hill of the ancient Samaria. The position is a very fine one; the hill rises some 400 to 500 feet above the open valley on the north, and is isolated on all sides but the east, where a narrow saddle exists some 200 feet lower than the top of the hill. There is a flat plateau on the top, on the east end of which the village stands, the plateau extending westwards for over half a mile. A higher knoll rises from the plateau, west of the village, from which a fine view is obtained as far as the Mediterranean Sea. The whole hill consists of soft soil, and is terraced to the very top. On the north it is bare and white, with steep slopes, and a few olives; a sort of recess exists on this side, which is all plough-land, in which stand the lower columns. On the south a beautiful olive-grove, rising in terrace above terrace, completely covers the sides of the hill, and a small extent of open terraced-land, for growing barley, exists towards the west and at the top. The village itself is ill-built, and modern, with ruins of a Crusading church of Neby Yahyah (St. John the Baptist), towards the northwest. [..] A sarcophagus lies by the road on the north-east, but no rock-cut tombs have as yet been noticed on the hill, though possibly hidden beneath the present plough-land. There is a large cemetery of rock-cut tombs to the north, on the other side of the valley. The neighbourhood of Samaria is well supplied with water. In the months of July and August a stream was found (in 1872) in the valley south of the hill, coming from the spring (Ain Harun), which has a good supply of drinkable water, and a conduit leading from it to a small ruined mill. Vegetable gardens exist below the spring.

It was a singular aircraft, being obsolescent as a fighter when it first appeared in 1934, but despite this it was used as such until 1940. The Luftwaffe showed an interest in it as a trainer, even though German first line fighters were completely different. The Ro.41 is almost unknown, compared to many other Italian aircraft, despite being one of the most numerous produced, in its 16-year career. Development The IMAM Ro.41 had its origins in the aircraft division of OFM (Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali). In 1929 Alessandro Tonini, the chief designer, had serious health problems and was replaced by Giovanni Galasso. This company, based in Naples, was taken over by Breda in 1935, and so Galasso's new aircraft designs received the IMAM designation of this company. One of the first was the Ro.41, flight tested by Niccolò Lana at Capodichino airfield on 16 June 1934. The first prototype was fitted with a Piaggio P.VII engine, and showed itself to be very agile, with excellent climb performance, and no noticeable vices. The second prototype, MM.281, was tested 31 January 1935, and taken on strength with the Regia Aeronautica. The third prototype had a Piaggio P.VII C.45 with two-stage compressor, giving 390 hp at 4,000 m. This was the definitive version of this aircraft, and fifty aircraft, numbers MM.2907-2956, were ordered. This first series was put in service in July 1935. Design A biplane, with the lower wing smaller than the upper, the Ro.41 was of mixed construction, the fuselage of chrome-molybdenum steel frame, covered in fabric. Duralumin covered the bottom and upper fuselage, and also the engine cowling. The wings were made of wood covered with fabric. There was a fixed undercarriage. The engine gave a theoretical 425 hp at ground level, 450 hp at 1,500 m, and 390 hp at 4,500 m, although it was much less in practice. The reliability was very good. A 176-litre fuel tank was inside the fuselage, near the engine, together with a 20-litre oil tank. The propeller was two-bladed and made of wood, later replaced by a metal two-blade model. Armament, when fitted, consisted of two 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns mounted inside the fuselage, with 850 cartridges. Performance This aircraft was designed as a fighter, but was underpowered even by mid-1930s standards. It resembled a small I-15, and was fairly agile. On tests it was able to reach an altitude of 1,000 metres in 1 minutes 32 seconds, 3,000 m in 3 min 47 sec, and 5,000 m in 7 min 34 sec, which was a much better climb rate than the standard Italian fighter, the Fiat CR.32 (3,000 m in 5 min 10 sec). It was also more manoeuvrable than the CR.32, and cost significantly less. However, a top speed of only 320 km/h was far too slow to make the Ro.41 a credible fighter, and the CR.32 had a better range, a better dive performance, was more heavily armed, and was already in service. Operational service The Ro.41 found a role as a trainer aircraft, for which it was well-suited, and a series of 30 two-seat aircraft first flew in 1937. The Ro.41 replaced the Breda Ba.25, and soon another 264 single-seat and 66 two-seat models were ordered. The Ro.41 was also proposed as light fighter. Twenty-eight were sent to Spain where, thanks to their high rate of climb, they acted as point- defence interceptors around Seville, though it appears that they did not score any victories. It served in 5 and 50 Wing as a fighter bomber, before the Breda Ba.65 arrived. XVI Gruppo, 50 Stormo, had all its three squadrons equipped with Ro.41s. 163 Sqn was sent to Rodi and used the Ro.41 as a fighter until 1940. Twelve Ro.41s served with 160 Gruppo in 1939 and were used as first line fighters, though the Gruppo was based on CR.32s and CR.42s. From 10 August 1940 four Ro.41s of 159 Sqn, 12 Gruppo, 50 Assault Wing were flown from Tobruk as night fighters. In its limited career as first line fighter the Ro.41 did not achieve any victories, and it is unlikely that it was ever involved in any air-combats. By this time even the CR.32 and CR.42s were obsolete, and the Ro.41s were only a stop-gap measure. Their real task was advanced training and despite the obsolete design they managed to be popular, reliable and cheap machines. They were also built by Agusta and AVIS. The Ro.41bis, with a smaller wing and better performance was tested, but the CR.32 was already available for flying schools, and it was not a success. In September 1938 MM.3786 was sent to Uruguay to display the type, but no orders were placed. Ro.41s were popular aircraft and for many years first line squadrons and flight schools operated it, until it became obsolete for first line use. One of the few changes was the fitting of a Piaggio P.VII RC.35 engine, that had a single-stage compressor which gave 500 hp at low level. Guns were seldom fitted, and two-seat versions had no weapons at all, and also carried less fuel. Production numbered 726 aircraft by 1943. After the armistice the RSI's Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana operated some aircraft, and the Luftwaffe used them as trainers in Germany and France. Strangely no examples remained in Southern Italy, perhaps because flight schools, like Castiglione del Lago airfield, were in the central and northern Italy. Five ANR aircraft survived the war. The Ro.41 was the first post-war aircraft to enter production when an order was sent to Agusta for 15 new aircraft (5 single and 10 two-seaters) and later ten more (7 single and 3 two-seaters). These aircraft had a wooden propeller, possibly spare parts still in store. They were painted silver, the new standard for Italian aircraft, instead of camouflage colours. Three of these machines formed the first acrobatic team of the Aeronautica Militare in 1947 at Padua. These aircraft were flown until 1950. In total production reached 753 aircraft.

It stood in The Loop neighborhood on a block bounded by Dearborn, Adams and Clark Streets and Jackson Boulevard. The site held an 1880 post office, courthouse and customhouse which was cleared to make way for the new building. The 1905 building was itself demolished in 1965 and replaced with the Kluczynski Federal Building. The push for a new building was spearheaded by postmaster Washington Hesing with backing by civic leaders and Illinois's members of Congress. The explosion of Chicago's population, especially after the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, strained the earlier facility beyond capacity. When the Exposition began, the Post Office Department in Chicago employed 998 clerks and 935 carriers. By the time Congress approved funding for a new building, the post office had expanded to 1,319 clerks and 1,096 carriers. Other agencies housed in the building complained of poor planning and shoddy construction which resulted in crumbling plaster, broken plumbing and flooding. The new building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by architect Henry Ives Cobb. The floorplan was a six- story Greek cross atop a two-story base with a raised basement. The building was capped by a dome at the crossing that held an additional eight floors of office space in its drum for a total of 16 floors. The gilt dome extended above the drum. Construction Congress passed a bill in late 1894 that President Grover Cleveland signed on February 13, 1895, appropriating $4 million to demolish the existing structure on the site and erect a new one. The 1880 building was considered dangerous and it was inadequate to house all the federal agencies in the city whose offices consequently were spread among several buildings. On January 20, 1896, Congress approved an additional $25,000 to employ a special architect. The Chicago Federal Building was the first government structure constructed with the purpose of housing the post office. Demolition began on the old building in June 1896 after the post office relocated to a temporary building on the site now occupied by the 333 North Michigan Avenue Building. Foundation work began in August 1897 and was completed in September 1898 at a cost of $208,000. The foundation was supported by wooden piles driven below street level. The basement and first two floors covered the entire site and measured by . On April 30, 1898, work for the superstructure was awarded to John Pierce, a New York contractor, who submitted a bid of $1,897,000. The building took seven years to construct because government policy at the time was to appropriate only enough funds for each contract as it was awarded. There was no general contractor and over 100 separate contracts were awarded during construction. The completed building reached a height of and was dedicated by President William McKinley October 9, 1899, the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The areas for the post office were completed in 1904 and other agencies occupied their spaces in 1905. Architecture Federal Building looking northwest from Dearborn and Jackson ca. 1910. The Federal Building was constructed over a steel frame with exterior walls of brick sheathed with of gray granite from Mount Waldo, Maine. The roofs were covered vitrified tile over book tile while the dome was covered with gilt glass tiles. The plan called for the post office to occupy the basement and two lower floors. The sixth, seventh and eighth floors of one wing held the courts, judges, clerks and US Marshal. The floors in the dome were reserved for the Civil Service Commission, Railway Mail Service and weather bureau with other agencies occupying the remaining space. The base consisted of a central entry on each facade flanked by eight bays of windows. The bays were separated by Corinthian pilasters with arches over the windows of the second floor. A cornice and balustrade topped the base on all four facades. Four Corinthian columns extending from the third to sixth floor supported a pediment on the face of each arm of the cross. The wings on the north-south axis held seven bays long while the wings on the east-west axis held five bays as the building was situated on a rectangular lot. The bays each held two windows grouped vertically and were separated by Corinthian pilasters. The eighth floor was housed in a shed dormers extending from the gabled roof. The dome was octagonal with a buttress at each corner of the drum. The buttresses were topped by corbels supporting a large double cornice encircling the sixteenth floor with a large eagle perched atop the corbels. The windows of the ninth through twelfth floors were set into three arches supported by more Corinthian columns. Between the eagles, were three circular windows with elaborately carved frames and above, another circular window pierced the midpoint of each face of the dome. After construction was complete, more than $2,000,000 remained for interior decoration of the Chicago Federal Building. The four wings met under the dome to form an octagonal rotunda, inspired by Imperial Roman architecture, that was open to the ninth floor. The rotunda's diameter made it larger than that of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The federal building was also the tallest capitol- style building constructed in Chicago, with the exception of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition buildings, most of which were demolished. Under the dome was a large public space surrounded by the floors containing office space. The interior details were accented with terra cotta and scagliola. Doors were oak with brass hardware and \\"US\\" molded into doorknobs. Mahogany was used in courtrooms and other offices. Marble from Tennessee, Vermont, Maine and Italy was used in corridor floors, wainscoting and stairways. Floors in the rotunda were marble accented with mosaic tile while railings and elevator grilles throughout the building were wrought iron. Ceilings were framed by egg-and- dart mouldings. The four courtrooms on the sixth floor contained a series of murals depicting historical moments in the development of law. Notable events Adams Street entrance after the 1918 bombing The Building housed the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois until 1964 and the US Court of Appeals-Seventh Circuit until 1938. The Federal Weather Bureau maintained offices in the dome and took official measurements from July 1, 1905 until December 31, 1925, when the official weather station moved to the University of Chicago campus. The Federal Building site maintained supplemental observation equipment until 1970. In 1907, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis presided over an antitrust case against Standard Oil in which the company was fined $29 million for accepting freight rebates from the railroads. The verdict was later set aside but in 1920, Landis went on to become the first Commissioner of Baseball. A powerful bomb exploded on the building's north side September 4, 1918, killing four people and injured 75 others, destroying the entrance doors and damaging windows of buildings across Adams Street. Two mail clerks and two patrons were killed in the explosion, which was immediately blamed upon the radical Industrial Workers of the World, which had recently been involved in a mass trial at the location. On September 7, 1918 police arrested a suspect with close ties to the IWW organization. Walt Disney worked at the post office in the building from July until September 1918. Authorities discovered another bomb October 31, 1921, before the device exploded. There was no damage to the building or its inhabitants. In 1931, the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson was the location for the trial of gangster Al Capone. On October 24, 1931, Wilkerson sentenced Capone to a 10-year in prison sentence and fine of $50,000 for tax evasion. His conviction was upheld by the appellate court December 20, 1937. The District and Circuit courts and several agencies relocated to the new Dirksen Federal Building across Dearborn Street and the building was demolished in 1965. The 45-floor Kluczynski Federal Building and Loop Postal Station, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, were built in its place. The plaza between the three structures is the setting for Alexander Calder's sculpture Flamingo.

He was known for his record-setting achievements. Nott set 79 world ballooning records and 96 British aviation records. He developed balloons for flights to Solar System destinations, particularly Titan. He flew a working prototype Titan balloon at minus 175 Celsius, approximately the temperature of Titan's atmosphere. Solar powered balloon G-BAVU first to cross English Channel on 1 Nov 1984 Life Julian Richard Nott was born in Bristol, UK on 22 June 1944 and attended Epsom College and St John’s College, Oxford. He earned a master’s in Physical Chemistry. After graduation Nott worked in Bangladesh with the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO). In 1972, Nott piloted the first hot air balloon crossing of the Sahara. In 1973, he traversed the Alps in a helium gas balloon. Nott hypothesized that two millennia ago, the Nazca Lines geoglyphs could have been formed with guidance of Nazca leaders in a balloon, possibly the earliest balloon flights in human history. In 1975 to support this theory, he designed and piloted the Nazca Prehistoric Balloon, using only methods and materials available to the Pre-Inca Peruvians 1,000 years ago. Nott believed, “...setting a world record is indisputable proof of the success of a new design.” In 1979 he designed and built the first hot air balloon with a pressurized gondola. On a late October morning from Longmont, Colorado he flew this new balloon to world record . It took Nott, in his balloon named \\"ICI Innovation,\\" 1 hour 9 minutes and 42 seconds to reach the world record altitude. The ICI Innovation gondola is permanently displayed at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum at Dulles Airport. Nott pioneered the use of hybrid energy for lift, where solar power is a significant heat source, and using this technology in 1981 he crossed the English Channel. This hybrid balloon relied only the heat of the sun to warm its lifting air during the crossing. For this historic flight, Nott used Dominic Michaelis’s solar balloon (aircraft registration number G-BAVU). On 22 August 1981, lifting off North West of Dover, he silently crossed the channel landing at Tournehem-sur-la-Hem of the Pas-de-Calais in France. Using the burner once, during the landing, to arrest the descent rate. The British Balloon Museum preserves the solar balloon G-BAVU envelope. On 1 November 1984, Nott became the first person to pilot a “pumpkin” superpressure balloon (SPB). He flew the SPB Wilson Endeavour across Australia from Pearce Air Force Base in Perth to Broken Hill; He believed this was his greatest achievement and planned to us the SPB to circumnavigate the globe. The superpressure balloon concept was further developed and used by NASA to carry unmanned payloads of up to 8000 pounds at up to ; circumnavigating the earth for 7 to 55 days. NASA Superpressure balloon Begins Globetrotting Journey from New Zealand Nott worked on the airships that flew over the 1984 Los Angeles and 2004 Athens Olympic Games. He developed a system for gas balloons in which conventional ballast is replaced with cryogenic helium. As Senior Balloon Consultant, Nott helped Alan Eustace break the world’s highest parachute jump record from an altitude of on 24 October 2014. In 2017, Nott set a world record for the highest tandem skydiving jump, from . As an adjunct professor at Cal Tech and the University of California, Nott lectured on entrepreneurship for scientist, engineers, and mathematicians.

The songs reflect the then-popular soul and Motown musical styles; no tracks were written by Richard. Recording Richard wished at the time Okeh would not release this album as it favored horns over rhythm. In his 1984, biography he noted \\"I was in the second year of the Okey (sic) contract and there was still no hit record. So I tore it up. The contract gave me no say in the material I recorded with them or in what was released. Larry Williams was the worst producer in the world. He wanted me to copy Motown and I was no Motown artist. [...] The Okeh stuff didn't sell at all because Okeh was an R'n'B label - a black label. I should have recorded on the Epic label, because I'm not primarily a black artist. It would have done a lot better.\\"White, Charles. (2003). The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography. Omnibus Press.
