Description Clytra laeviuscula can reach a length of and a width of about .Commanster These beetles have elongated bodies and shiny red-orange elytra with four black spots, two larger around the center of the elytra and two smaller on the shoulders. The prothorax is black and shiny. The head and legs are black, as well as the antennae that are quite short. Clytra laeviuscula can be distinguished from ladybirds (family Coccinellidae) by its more elongated form and by its tarsi (ends of the legs) formed of five parts (three for ladybugs). This species is rather similar to Clytra quadripunctata. Biology Adults occurs frequently from May to August. They are phytophagous. The feed on leaves, flowers and pollen of deciduous trees, mainly of Quercus robur, Salix, Populus, Betula, Fraxinus excelsior, Fagus sylvatica, Dorycnium, Prunus, Ulmus and Corylus avellana.BRC - Database of Insects and their Food Plants They feed also on pollen of Rosa canina, Polygonum bistorta and Leucanthemum vulgare. Clytra laeviuscula has a special relationship with ants. The females wrap each egg with their hind legs in a ball of about 2 mm of excrements/feces and leaves it in the vicinity of an anthill. The eggs are taken to the nest by ants, where the larvae made a kind of tube that serves to protect them from ants. They feed on the waste and other detritus left by the ants, on their eggs and on their larvae. The adults usually emerge after about two weeks.Tatyana Robertivna Stefanovska, Edwin E Lewis First Record Of Clytra Laeviuscula Ratzeburg As Potential Insect Pest Of Energy Willow (Salix Viminalis L.)

S ","title":"List of painters by name beginning with &quot;S&quot;"},{"id":"30631578","text":"Clostridium bifermentans (CLOBI) is an anaerobic, motile, gram-positive bacterium. Toxins and mosquito larvae A certain subspecies, Clostridium bifermentans subsp. Malaysia, was the first anaerobic bacterium known to kill mosquito larvae. The subspecies was part of a collection at the Institute for Medical Research, Malaysia. A biochemical analysis found that the mosquitocidal cry toxin is coded by four genes in an operon: cry16Aa, cry17Aa, cbm17.1, and cbm17.2. When the four genes were individually expressed, none of the four proteins encoded exhibited mosquitocidal activity. This suggests that the toxicity requires four proteins cooperating as a complex to take effect. A single promoter was found upstream of the four genes, indicating that the four were likely to be expressed simultaneously. The half-life of toxicity was about one day and the toxin was unstable in high temperature. Although C. bifermentans subsp. Malaysia is shown to be more lethal to Anopheles mosquito larvae, the toxin produced by Cry operon has no mosquitocidal effect on mature Anopheles individuals. Thus, the genes accountable for the toxicity towards Anopheles are different than those controlled by the cry operon; rather, the toxins selectively target Aedes mosquito larvae, in which they cause high mortality.

The term is often restricted to the application of thermal energy following the ion implantation of dopants. In the most common industrial example, rapid thermal processing is applied to silicon following the ion implantation of dopants such as phosphorus, arsenic and boron. Vacancies generated at elevated temperature (1200 °C) facilitate the movement of these species from interstitial to substitutional lattice sites while amorphization damage from the implantation process recrystallizes. A relatively rapid process, peak temperature is often maintained for less than one second to minimize unwanted chemical diffusion.

Family Mattei was the third of three sons of Alessandro Mattei and Emilia Mazzatosta and the younger brother of Ciriaco Mattei and Cardinal Girolamo Mattei. He married Costanza Gonzaga (of the House of Gonzaga) and they had three sons: *Girolamo Mattei, future Duca di Giove *Luigi Mattei, future Marquis di Belmonte *Paolo Mattei Patron of the arts and architecture In 1597, Mattei and his brother Ciriaco paid 65,000 scudi for the fortified comune of GioveBerkshire Review: Giove which allowed Mattei to be appointed Duca di Giove (Duke of Giove). Mattei passed the title and property to his son, Girolamo. Between 1598 and 1618, Mattei commissioned architect Carlo Maderno to build the Palazzo Mattei.The lives of the modern painters, sculptors and architectsby Giovanni Pietro Bellori & Hellmut Wohl (2005) Mattei was a strong supporter of baroque artist Caravaggio. The artist lived at Mattei residences, the Palazzo Mattei and latter the Villa Mattei and Mattei (and his brother Ciriaco) commissioned a large number of works from the painter. The works included The Taking of Christ (for which Mattei and his brother paid a paltry 125 scudi). It was reported that Mattei began a tradition which later took hold among Italian noblemen and carried on through the 17th century. Upon meeting his social \\"superior\\", Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (both were in carriages) in a public street, Mattei ordered his carriage stopped as a mark of respect. The cardinal then ordered his carriage to come alongside Mattei's so that the two could converse. The practice became a standard part of interactions between the various sub-classes of Italian nobility.

General Gray's vision was to establish a \\"world-class educational institution for the study of war and the profession of arms.\\" The original seminar was attended by six lieutenant colonels and was ten months long. Following General Gray's vision and charter, the course of study matured into the current College and was patterned after other United States military senior-level service colleges. By 1999, the college became an accredited JPME Phase-I institution, enrolling 16 students from all five branches of the Armed Forces and various government agencies. In 2002, the college received full accreditation from both the United States Department of Education and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to confer a Master of Strategic Studies degree. In 2006, the college received JPME Phase-II accreditation. In 2009, the college expanded its student population and opened enrollment to include international military officers.

The PCAC has won numerous state championships in the CCCAA. History In California, following World War II, several new colleges were opened causing many new Conference alignments. In San Diego County, the first college involved in athletics was San Diego City College in the 1920s. Oceanside/Carlsbad (MiraCosta College) began in 1934. In 1962, Imperial Valley College opened their new college campus. Starting in the 1920s, there were community colleges operating in El Centro and Brawley. Palomar College began in 1946. In 1961, Southwestern and Grossmont colleges opened, and in 1964, San Diego Mesa College opened. During these years, a second issue causing conferencing changes was the varying size of colleges. To be immediately eligible for athletics, an athlete needed to have been a local high school graduate. This caused great difficulty in finding realistic levels of competition for smaller colleges who, for the most part, were geographically isolated. The state designated conferences by small colleges or large colleges with separate play-off structures. When the small college designation was dropped, it motivated the forming of separate conferences for football only and using geographic consideration for all other sports. The Pacific Coast Conference was first organized in 1982-83 with the following memberships: Grossmont, Imperial Valley, MiraCosta, Palomar, Saddleback, San Diego City, San Diego Mesa, and Southwestern Colleges. In 1994-95, Saddleback left the Conference and joined the Orange Empire Conference. In 1987, Cuyamaca College, a second campus in the Grossmont District, became a member. Prior to 1982, the Conference colleges belonged to several different conferences. San Diego City College, and later San Diego Mesa College, belonged to the Metropolitan Conference. Imperial Valley College and Oceanside Junior College, now MiraCosta College, were in the Desert Conference, and later with Palomar and Southwestern Colleges in the South Central Conference. In 1962-1964, Grossmont and Southwestern Colleges were in the Eastern Conference. In 1964-65, five San Diego County colleges formed the Pacific Southwest Conference: Grossmont, Palomar, San Diego City, San Diego Mesa and Southwestern Colleges. For two years, 1965 to 1967, Oceanside/Carlsbad (now MiraCosta College) and Imperial Valley College joined the Conference. In 1967-68, they left the Conference and rejoined the Desert Conference. During 1968-69, for football, Grossmont, Palomar, and Southwestern colleges were in the Southeastern Conference. San Diego City and San Diego Mesa Colleges were in the Metro Conference. In 1969-70, the Mission, an all sports conference, was formed, consisting of Chaffey, Citrus, Cypress, Grossmont, Palomar, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Southwestern Colleges. In 1974, Grossmont changed to the Foothill Conference. Beginning in 1977, the Conference included both men and women’s teams. Prior to 1977, the women’s teams were considered club teams and were not under the State Commission of Athletics. The Pacific Coast Conference rotates the Conference President’s position, alphabetically from college to college. The first Conference Commissioner was Chester S. DeVore. He served in the position from 1982 through 1998. Felix Rogers was selected to the Commissioner position in 1998 and still serves in that position. The Conference has been active in seeking ways to improve Community College Athletics locally and statewide. Beginning in 1996-97, after several years of rejection by the Commission on Athletics (C.O.A.), the Conference was authorized to allow open recruiting in adjacent community college districts in San Diego County.

For most of his career he worked in (Western) Germany, where he started a few years after World War II at BFN in Hamburg. He became a popular disc jockey and presenter also at German networks. He also was a prolific Schlager-singer and starred in films.  Youth in England  Chris Howland was born in London and brought up in Southern England and became a professional beekeeper.  Radio career  In 1948 he started working for the BFN in Germany. The British programmes were popular among German youths who would rather listen to British music than to the comparatively slow contemporary German music. So his popularity subsequently soon exceeded his actual target audience. Howland also got acquainted with the German language. In 1952, when he already spoke German fluently, he was hired by the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk broadcaster. Still, when he debuted six years later as a singer, he did it in German and had two hits. But in 1959 he stopped doing radio shows and returned to Britain.  TV career  On British TV Howland had a show called Peoples and Places but he was not as popular as in Germany where the audiences loved his British accent. So after two years he continued his career in Germany. Here he got a show called Studio B . which featured pop stars in a new way that included a lot of humour. The show was broadcast more than sixty times. Howland's next coup was a version of Candid Camera for German TV.  Cinema career  From 1954 Howland acted in more than twenty films, including six European Karl May films. In 2007 he appeared in a parody on German Edgar Wallace feature films. He acted mainly in comedies which were carried out in a style quite like the British Carry On films.  Accent as trademark  Like the Dutch TV presenter, singer and actor Rudi Carrell and the American musician, actor and journalist Bill Ramsey (who also appeared as guest in Howland's show \\"Studio B\\") he made his accent his trademark.  Recent activities  Until his death Howland lived outside Cologne and worked again as a radio presenter and appeared occasionally as an actor or talker on TV. In 2009 he published his memoirs Yes, Sir. The book was well received. Howland died on 29 November 2013.

Because of the historical context in which Mannheim wrote, some critics contend that the theory of generations centers around Western ideas and lacks a broader cultural understanding. Müller Schwarze, Nina 2015 The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland Press. Others argue that the theory of generations should be global in scope, due to the increasingly globalized nature of contemporary society. Theory Mannheim defined a generation (note that some have suggested that the term cohort is more correct, to distinguish social generations from the kinship (family, blood- related generations) as a group of individuals of similar ages whose members have experienced a noteworthy historical event within a set period of time. According to Mannheim, social consciousness and perspective of youth reaching maturity in a particular time and place (what he termed \\"generational location\\") is significantly influenced by the major historical events of that era (thus becoming a \\"generation in actuality\\").Willis, John. Generations and Social Movements of the 60's and 70's. Revised version of a paper presented at Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association (Chicago, Illinois, September 5–9, 1977) A key point, however, is that this major historical event has to occur, and has to involve the individuals in their young age (thus shaping their lives, as later experiences will tend to receive meaning from those early experiences); a mere chronological contemporaneity is not enough to produce a common generational consciousness. Mannheim in fact stressed that not every generation will develop an original and distinctive consciousness. Whether a generation succeeds in developing a distinctive consciousness is significantly dependent on the pace of social change (\\"tempo of change\\"). Mannheim notes also that social change can occur gradually, without the need for major historical events, but those events are more likely to occur in times of accelerated social and cultural change. Mannheim did also note that the members of a generation are internally stratified (by their location, culture, class, etc.), thus they may view different events from different angles and thus are not totally homogenous. Even with the \\"generation in actuality\\", there may be differing forms of response to the particular historical situation, thus stratifying by a number of \\"generational units\\" (or \\"social generations\\"). Application Mannheim's theory of generations has been applied to explain how important historical, cultural, and political events of the late 1950s and the early 1960s educated youth of the inequalities in American society, such as their involvement along with other generations in the Civil Rights Movement, and have given rise to a belief that those inequalities need to be changed by individual and collective action. This has pushed an influential minority of young people in the United States toward social movement activity. On the other hand, the generation which came of age in the later part of the 1960s and 1970s was much less engaged in social movement activity, because - according to the theory of generations - the events of that era were more conducive to a political orientation stressing individual fulfillment instead of participation in such social movements questioning the status quo. Other notable applications of Mannheim's theory that illustrate the dynamics of generational change include: * The effects of the Great Depression in the U.S. on young people's orientations toward work and politics * How the Nazi regime in Germany affected young Germans' political attitudes * Collective memories of important historical events that happen during late adolescence or early adulthood * Changing patterns of civic engagement in the U.S. * The effects of coming of age during the second-wave feminist movement in the U.S. on feminist identity * Explaining the rise of same-sex marriage in the United States * The effects of the Chinese Cultural Revolution on youth political activism Social generation studies have mainly focused on the youth experience from the perspective of the Western society. \\"Social generations theory lacks ample consideration of youth outside of the west. Increased empirical attention to non-Western cases corrects the tendency of youth studies to 'other' non-Western youth and provides a more in-depth understanding of the dynamics of reflexive life management.\\" The constraints and opportunities affecting a youth's experiences within particular sociopolitical contexts require research to be done in a wide array of spaces to better reflect the theory and its implications on youth's experiences.

ISSN 0891-1851 Design and development Designer Mark Beierle's original goals were an \\"airplane with the feel of a hang glider, the agility and visibility of a helicopter, the effortless smooth flight of a sailplane, and the utility and economy of a general aviation aircraft--all in the hopes of getting close to the feel and freedom of a bird.\\" When queried by interviewer Don Downie if that was too much to ask, Beierle replied, \\"You bet! But it didn't stop me from trying.\\" The Thunder Gull was introduced in 1987 as a development of the earlier Laughing Gull. The aircraft was quite revolutionary when it was introduced due to its high performance and particularly high cruise speed of on just . The aircraft is constructed from aluminum tubing and sheet parts and covered in aircraft fabric. The aircraft can meet the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including its maximum empty weight limitation of when it is equipped with a lightweight engine.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 44. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The aircraft has a very small wing for the US ultralight category with a wing area of only and a wingspan of . The wing is equipped with flaps that give it a stall speed of . The small wing gives the aircraft a high cruise speed and better resistance to turbulence than a lighter-loaded wing. The one-piece wing is quickly removable for storage or transport. Reported construction time of the kit is 150 hours.

Located on Ketcham Road west of the community of Smithville, it is one of the oldest houses in Monroe County, and it has been designated a historic site. History In 1823, Kentucky resident Joseph Mitchell was awarded a land grant in present-day Monroe County in return for his service in the War of 1812. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Six years later he moved his family to the site;Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. Monroe County Interim Report. Bloomington: Bloomington Restorations, 1989-06. here he built a log cabin, but as the years passed, it became insufficient for the family's needs. Accordingly, Mitchell constructed the present brick house in 1835, adding its final details two years later; the clay for its bricks was dug on his farm, and the bricks were fired in a kiln adjacent to the house site. After living in the house for fifteen years, Mitchell and his family moved to Iowa; they sold the property to Joseph's younger brother John, and it remained in the ownership of the Mitchell family until 1922. Starting in that year, it began to pass through the hands of several different owners before being purchased by longtime owners William and Nelda Christ in 1973; as of 2011, they still owned the property.Property Assessment Detail Report , Monroe County, n.d. Accessed 2011-01-25. Construction Mitchell built his house in the shape of the letter \\"L,\\" one story high and in the Federal style of architecture. The building rests on a foundation of rubble masonry, and it is covered with a gabled roof with eaves and boxed cornices. The roof appears to have been built originally with wooden shingles, although the present shingles are now made of asphalt. On the first floor, the house features a main facade that looks toward the west; four bays wide, it includes three large windows and an off- center door; the original windows were replaced in the 1980s in a fashion similar to the originals. Toward the south, there are no windows and only a single doorway, which allows access to the basement; the plain gabled wall appears once to have been hidden by a porch that was removed due to structural deterioration. Toward the east, only one small window allows light into the house, while the northern end is unpierced by windows. The interior of the \\"L\\" lies north and east of the house; multiple doors and windows open onto it. Inside, the house is divided into four rooms: a parlor, a bedroom, a \\"keeping room,\\" and the kitchen. Soon after the house was constructed, a frame addition was constructed on the house's northern end; it included a loft in which family members once slept. Significant elements of the interior include four large fireplaces, large mantels, ornate trim, and white-painted poplar wood. Its floor plan is typical of the \\"hall-and-parlor\\" style of house, which typically features two large rooms or two pairs of rooms. Recognition In 1986, the Joseph Mitchell House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As the third-oldest house in Monroe County, it was deemed significant primarily because of its architecture, despite the presence of alterations such as the removal of the original porch. It is part of a group of historic houses on Ketcham Road, although it is the oldest and most historically significant of them, and it is one of more than forty National Register-listed properties and historic districts countywide.

Career Jara Martínez started his career with Paraguayan outfit Club Nacional Asunción, with whom he participated in the 2010 Torneo di Viareggio, a youth international tournament during which he was noticed by Palermo director of football Walter Sabatini. He was subsequently offered a trial in February 2010, joining the first team for a number of weeks and taking part to their training sessions; in order to defy journalists from his real identity, Sabatini referred him to the journalists using the name of \\"Gonzalez\\". On 31 August 2010 Palermo confirmed the signing of Jara Martínez from Nacional Asunción. The player immediately joined the under-19 youth team, but only made his competitive debut later on November due to bureaucratic issues. Since then, the player has trained occasionally with the first-team squad, and also appeared on the bench for a number of Serie A games. On 25 January 2011, an injury crisis that left Palermo with only an available first-team striker (captain Fabrizio Miccoli) led head coach Delio Rossi to call him up for the 2010–11 Coppa Italia quarter-final game against Parma, a game that saw Jara Martínez making his first team debut as a 70th-minute replacement for Miccoli. The match ultimately ended to a penalty shootout, with Jara Martínez himself scoring the decisive goal that led Palermo into the semi-finals of the competition. This was followed by a lacklustre season where Jara Martínez was regularly benched in the Primavera team too, behind other promising youngsters such as Mauro Bollino, César Verdún and Cephas Malele. On 20 August 2012, Palermo announced to have loaned Jara Martínez to Genoa in an exchange deal that involved the permanent signing of Steve von Bergen for €1.7 million and the permanent sale of Alexandros Tzorvas for €600,000. After spending a full season with the youth squad, he was permanently signed by Genoa and successively loaned to Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Nocerina. On 10 July 2014 he was signed by San Marino.

All music was performed by members of the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra, which also performed on the Dead Space Original Soundtrack. Composition and recording Speaking in an interview, soundtrack composer Jason Graves offered the following explanation of his thought process for the composition of the music for Dead Space 2: Speaking about the recording of the music and how it was made to reflect the central character of the game, Graves noted that \\"Isaac definitely has a more identifiable character arc in the sequel. I used a string quartet, which is the antithesis of the huge, churning orchestra, to portray Isaac's vulnerability and character arc as he progresses through the game.\\" Graves also revealed that Isaac's leitmotif was composed in the note order of D-E-A-D, spelling 'DEAD', and that he approached the composition process for Dead Space 2 by objectively criticising his own work on the original Dead Space, identifying areas in which the music could be improved and focusing on those. In the official Electronic Arts press release, Graves commented that \\"The score really runs the gamut as you play through the game. There are much bigger and scarier pieces along with quieter, more personal moments to counterbalance them. I wrote for string quartet to portray Isaac's vulnerable side.

He helped the Mattei rise to prominence by supporting political and cultural initiatives of the Pope and the Church in Rome. Political activity Mattei and his family were Roman Catholic but lived in the part of Rome which became the Roman Ghetto; the portion of the city which housed the Roman Jewish population. When Pope Paul IV decided to build a wall around the Ghetto in 1555 and imprison the Jewish population, Mattei was given a key to the gate.Fontana delle tartarughe, the iconography of a Roman fountain by Anne Kristine Tagstad Fontana delle Tartarughe Between 1580 and 1585, Mattei commissioned one of the most famous fountains in Rome; the Fontana delle Tartarughe (Turtle Fountain) in front of his residence. In an original plan of 1570 a new fountain was to have been placed near the Theater of Marcellus in the Piazza Giudea, the site of a market in the Jewish ghetto. Mattei had been appointed to the committee which would select the site, though, and used his influence and money to have the fountain location changed to the small Piazza Mattei, in the block where the members of his family lived.The Waters of Rome, Morton (pg. 73-74)Fontaines de Rome, Maurizia Tazartes (pg. 62) Mattei also offered to pay to have the piazza properly paved to ensure the sculpture would be well protected; \\"che il signor Mutio Matthei si obblighi a far mattonare\\" (\\"...that Mr Muzio Matthei undertakes to make paved\\").La fontana delle Tartarughe fra arte, storia e leggenda by Alessandro Venditti (2003) A popular Roman legend suggests Mattei, ruined by gambling, ordered the fountain to be built overnight in order to impress the wealthy father of a woman he wished to marry. The next morning he opened the window of his palazzo and showed his future father-in-law the fountain. The father, suitably impressed, allowed the marriage to go ahead, and Mattei, to remember the event, had the window overlooking the fountain closed up. A window closed by brick still overlooks the fountain.The legend is recounted in Georgio Carpaneto, Le famiglie nobili romane, Rome, 2000 pg. 254, cited by Anne Kristine Togstad. Other projects It seems Mattei played a role as financier or \\"project manager\\" for a number of projects commissioned by Pope Sixtus V. Mattei was responsible for carrying out the orders of Sixtus in relation to the construction of the Four Fountains of Rome. On 23 May 1589, Sixtus V issued the following order: Though his role is unclear, he was also responsible for some portion of the planning or construction supervision for the Palazzo Albani del Drago on the Quirinal Hill.

In a departure from Andrea's other known romances, there are no discernible French or Franco-Venetian sources for this narrative, which unfolds instead in the manner of a travel account. It draws for its details on a variety of predecessors, such as, for the oracular Tree of the Sun and the Moon, the Alexander romances, and—outside the romance tradition—on Dante's Divine Comedy, on the \\"natural history\\" found in medieval bestiaries, and on the legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick and the cosmology of Ptolemy.Allaire 2000:244ff. The quest involved is the rootless Guerrino's search for his lost parents. There is an undercutting element of deconstruction of chivalrous ideals apparent from the very title: Guerrino derives from guerra \\"war\\", but meschino means, \\"shabby, paltry, ignoble\\";The Diccionario de la Real Academia Española derives mezquino from hispano-arabic miskin: \\"falto de nobleza y espiritu. Desdichado, desgraciado e inféliz\\". the hero, cast away as a babe sold by pirates and rebaptized by his foster father Meschino, the \\"unlucky\\", rises through his heroic efforts to his proper status as Guerr[i]ero, \\"warrior\\". At the end of his adventures Guerrino discovers that he is the son of Milone, Duke of Durazzo, who was himself the son of a Duke of Burgundy, so that Guerrino is of royal blood.Falconieri & McCuaig, p. 152 Guerrino is the sole protagonist; other characters exist only insofar as they encounter him. The far-ranging episodes create a fictional geography as seen from the Mediterranean world.F. Cardini, \\"Orizzonti geografici e orizzonti matici nel Guerrin Meschino\\" Temas medievales, 7 (1997:11-36); for Andrea's geography based in readings of Ptolemy: Heinrich Hawickhorst, \\"Über die Geographie bei Andrea de' Magnabotti\\", Romanische Forschungen 13 (1902:689-784) Guerrin's enchanted sojourn in the cave of the Sibyl bears parallels with the Germanic traditions of Tannhäuser. Prester John plays a role, offering Guerrin the signoria over half of all India, following a battle. Most of the challenges Guerrin faces, however, are moral rather than military, even where the supernatural character of the site is explicitly non- Christian, such as the sanctuary of the Trees of the Sun and Moon. Like Dante, he was granted a view of Purgatory, the Purgatorio di San Patrizio. The work has had a checkered career under the scrutiny of the Church. Many modern editions reprint the bowdlerized Venetian edition of 1785, pubblicata con licenza dei superiori, which suppressed all mention of the Sibilla Apenninica sited in a grotto on Monte Sibilla in the Apennines,For her history: L. Paolucci, La Sibilla appenninica (Florence: Olschki) 1967. substituting various Italian circumlocutions: Fata, Fatalcina, Ammaliatrice, Incantatrice, etc. An entire chapter, Book V, in which the Apennine Sibyl describes the other classical Sibyls, was completely suppressed. Astronomical references were also deleted by the censor. A critical text, based on Florentine Quattrocento manuscripts, was edited by Paola Moreno, and published in 2005.Paola Moreno, Il Guerrin Meschino. Edizione critica secondo l’antica vulgata fiorentina (Ed. Mauro Cursietti. Rome: Antenore, 2005). The work was so popular that it was translated for a Spanish audience by Alonso Hernández Alemán, as Guarino Mezquino; by the time it was printed in Castilian in 1512 it had received 21 printings in Italian.Nieves Baranda, ed. La Corónica del noble Cavallero Guarino Mezquino (Madrid, 1992); Nieves Baranda, \\"El Guarino Mazquino [1527]\\", Edad de oro 21 (Madrid, 2002); the Seville 1527 edition has received a reader's guide by Karla P. Amozurrutia Nava, Guarino Mezquino: guía de lectura (2008: \\"Origen y estructua\\", 7). It had staying power, too: the literary Venetian courtesan Tullia d'Aragona rendered it in epic verse, now \\"most chaste, all pure, all Christian,\\" as Il Meschino, altramente detto il Guerrino (Venice 1560, 2nd ed. 1594), though the source she acknowledged to the reader was the perhaps more respectable Amadis de Gaula.Valeria Finucci, \\"Fonte and women's chivalric romances\\", in (Moderata Fonte) Finucci, ed.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, episodes from Il Guerrin Meschino have been adapted for the Italian stage, and even for children.In Rome, \\"a novelty for me was the children's theater, that Teatro dei Piccoli where day after day all winter at five the marionettes entertain an audience of little people with such delightful performances as \\"Guerin Meschino,\\"... noted Elizabeth Hazelton Haight, Italy Old and New, 1922:20. Le Meravigliose avventure di Guerrin Meschino is a 1951 Italian film that takes its general tenor from the romance. Guerrin was adapted twice for the Italian comic books called fumetti, once in 1959 in 17 installments under the title Guerino detto il Meschino and again running in the Corriere dei Piccoli.Details in Italian Wikipedia: Il Guerrin Meschino Guerin Sportivo, an Italian sport and satirical weekly magazine founded in 1912 in Turin, takes its title from the protagonist.

Life Petrus Vulcanius, born Pieter De Smet in Bruges, was the son of Andries De Smet and Margriete Krippijn. He was educated in the Bogaerdenschool in Bruges, a school for poor and abandoned children, supported by the city. In June 1523 he was registered at the University of Leuven as a \\"poor man\\" (arme). Here too he was supported financially by the city of Bruges. He was awarded a degree in law in 1527. He continued his studies at the Collegium Trilingue in Leuven, where he further developed his skills in Latin and Greek. He gained the friendship of Erasmus, of the Hellenist J. van Stazeele, and of the teacher of Hebrew, John van Campen, and was also close to his fellow townsmen Johannes Vasaeus (Jan Was) and Jacob van Halewijn, a canon in the chapter of the Church of Our Lady in Bruges. Thanks to the recommendations of Erasmus and of Juan Luis Vives, Vulcanius lived in London between 1529 and 1531 as the tutor of Charles Blount, son of William Blount, Lord Mountjoy. On 1 September 1531 he was appointed taalman, or legal functionary, of the city of Brugge. From this time onwards he maintained relations with many humanists both in Bruges, such as Vives, Jacobus Curtius, Jan Fevijn and Joris Cassander, and many others outside the city. In 1543 Vulcanius undertook a long journey to Germany and Italy. In the same year he married Adrianette Truwaert. They had five children, including Bonaventura Vulcanius.

Swain County High School is a part of the Swain County School System. It is the only 9-12 high school in the county. History Swain County High School is a result of consolidations in the 1950s and a 1970s building program. It was originally four high schools: Bryson City (1924), Whittier (1936), Alarka (1938), and Almond (1925), but in 1950 additions were made to Bryson City High School and officials named it Swain County High School. The high school remained at this campus on School House Hill in Bryson City until 1977, when a two-story, tan brick high school and gymnasium were finished northwest of Bryson City on Fontana Road. The old high school then became Bryson City Elementary School until restructuring of the school system in 1991. At the time of restructuring, there were four kindergarten through 8th grade elementary schools in Swain County, at Whittier, Bryson City, Alarka, and Almond. In 1991, Swain East Elementary and Swain West Elementary opened to students, replacing the older community-based schools. The middle school was located in the former Almond Elementary School building until 1994, when the newly rebuilt, renovated, and expanded Bryson City campus opened its doors as Swain County Middle School. In 1997, 6th grade was added to the middle school, along with an expansion to the facilities. In 2000, a new auditorium and several new classrooms were added to Swain County High School. This annex now houses the Swain County Center for the Arts. In 2011, eight new classrooms were added to Swain West Elementary, and officials drew plans for a new high school. These plans called for moving the middle school, and restructuring the Elementary School districts. However, due to budget constraints, the county ultimately funded a massive refurbishments and addition to the current high school. =Football= Swain County High School has eight North Carolina state football championships with the most recent coming in 2011.Swain County High School also has one undefeated season, one regional championship and two league championships. The culture around Swain is filled with a football rich atmosphere. =Future plans= Presently, the school is developing a plan to build a new School somewhere nearby on land that the school board already owns; the present building would then become a new Middle School and the current Middle School would become an Elementary School, alleviating overcrowding of Swain East and Swain West Elementary Schools. Accreditation The school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.

Born in London, England, Termer began his musical career at the age of 15. Termer met Stanley Watson, who introduced him to Laurie Morgan while at Tottenham Technical College. Watson played guitar and Morgan drums. Termer was learning piano so they got together and later found Don Rendell, who had a battered old alto sax at the time. During the war it was normal practice to keep playing during an air raid, which had its own unique, character building lessons, for a young musician. A relative of Termer's, Hal Moss, violinist and impresario, had a show on the road called Scandals and Scanties and when his musicians got called up he asked Termer, Watson, Rendell and Morgan to help out. They quickly learnt how to play as they went along. Termer was eventually called up into the army which by this time he had been playing the theatres with Watson, Rendell and Morgan as The Rhythm Racketeers. Watson, Rendell and Morgan went into U.S. Army camp shows. They used to send Termer cartons of cigarettes. During this period, Termer practised with Johnny Dankworth, Tony Crombie and Ronnie Scott while they were in their teens. Termer's first job after the war was with Ken Turner at the Plaza Ballroom, Derby, with Kenny Graham, tenor sax, Terry Brown, trumpet and Phil Seaman, drums. Termer learned a lot from Graham about writing. From there he went with Duncan Whyte, Carl Barriteau, Nat Temple plus gig bands on the scene, and society gigs. Then taking a residence at the Stork Club, London for seven years he formed a trio with Monty Babson on drums and Bill Bramwell on bass. It was a haunt for show people and they got to accompany such names as Danny Kaye, Billie Holiday, Pearl Bailey, and Sarah Vaughan. On leaving the Stork Club, Termer freelanced around, but mainly he accompanied Diana Dors, whenever she did cabaret.

Born in Tenterfield, New South Wales, he joined the RAAF active reserve in 1934, and transferred to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) shortly before World War II. Posted to the Middle East in July 1940, Jeffrey saw action with No. 3 Squadron and took command of the unit the following year, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for his energy and fighting skills. He was appointed wing leader of No. 234 Wing RAF in November 1941, and became an ace the same month with his fifth solo victory. The next month he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his achievements, which included rescuing a fellow pilot who had crash landed in the desert. In 1942, Jeffrey was posted to the South West Pacific, where he helped organise No. 75 Squadron for the defence of Port Moresby, and No. 76 Squadron prior to the Battle of Milne Bay. He served two stints in charge of No. 2 Operational Training Unit in southern Australia before the end of the war, broken by command of No. 1 (Fighter) Wing in the Northern Territory and Western Australia during 1943–44, at which time he was promoted to temporary group captain. Jeffrey was transferred to the RAAF reserve after the war but returned to the PAF in 1951, holding training posts in Victoria and command of RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia, before resigning in 1956. Outside the military, he was a grazier and stockbroker. He died in 1997 at the age of 83. Early life The son of A. L. Jeffrey, Peter Jeffrey was born in Tenterfield, New South Wales, on 6 July 1913. He was educated at Church of England Preparatory School in Toowoomba, Queensland, and at Cranbrook in Sydney.Alexander, Who's Who in Australia 1962, p. 449 Having spent time as a jackaroo, by 1934 he was in his first year of engineering studies at Sydney University, residing in St Andrew's College.Newton, Australian Air Aces, pp. 93–94Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, pp. 142–143 In December that year, he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 225–226 Jeffrey undertook flying instruction on the 1935 'B' (reservists) course conducted by No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, and was commissioned as a pilot officer in July.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 239–240 Serving with No. 22 (City of Sydney) Squadron from July 1936, he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) on a short-service commission in May 1938. He was then assigned to No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, as an instructor. In January 1939, he was posted to Britain to attend the Specialists Signals Course at Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and was promoted to flight lieutenant in September. World War II Completing his course at Cranwell in November 1939, Jeffrey returned to Australia the following January as Signals Officer with No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He resumed flying duties in June 1940, and posted out to the Middle East as a flight commander with No. 3 Squadron on 15 July. =Middle East= Peter Turnbull in Palestine, 6 June 1941.alt=Two men in flying goggles talking beside an aircraft cockpit Sailing via Bombay, India, No. 3 Squadron arrived at Suez, Egypt, in late August 1940.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 80Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 57 Along with most of his comrades, Jeffrey flew obsolescent Gloster Gladiator biplanes in support of the Australian 6th Division during the North African Campaign; he claimed no victories at this stage.Thomas, Gloster Gladiator Aces, p. 85 Promoted squadron leader, he took over No. 3 Squadron from Wing Commander Ian McLachlan on 13 February 1941, by which time the unit had converted to Hawker Hurricane monoplane fighters.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 70Thomas, Hurricane Aces, pp. 49, 92 Based at RAF Benina in defence of Benghazi when Jeffrey assumed command, No. 3 Squadron retreated eastwards only hours ahead of German tanks after Rommel launched his offensive in April. The Australians were forced to use ten different airfields in as many days before the Allies regrouped. Jeffrey was flying a Hurricane when he claimed his first aerial victory on 15 April 1941. Following a flight of four German Junkers Ju 52 transports back to their base near Fort Capuzzo, Libya, he shot one down before it landed and strafed the other three on the ground, setting all on fire.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 74 He was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for this exploit, as well as his \\"untiring efforts\\" and \\"high standard of efficiency ... under extremely trying conditions\\"; the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 13 May. After converting to P-40 Tomahawks the same month, No. 3 Squadron took part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. Jeffrey scored the unit's first victory in the new fighter when he shot down in flames an Italian Junkers Ju 88 over the sea near Beirut on 13 June 1941.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, pp. 8–9 Two days later he destroyed a Vichy French Martin 167 bomber in southern Syria.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 91 Jeffrey was credited with another Ju 88 before the squadron returned to North Africa in September to support the Allied counter-attack against the Afrika Korps.Shores; Williams, Aces High, p. 192 He was mentioned in despatches on 24 September 1941. alt=Two men talking, one in light-coloured military fatigues, the other in a dark-coloured battle jacket As commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron, Jeffrey came up with innovative ways of improving morale in the face of living conditions that were \\"primitive at best\\". On one occasion he arranged accommodation for his men near a beach, well away from the din of night-time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis. Another of his more \\"radical ideas\\" and lasting legacies was a combined mess for all pilots in the combat zone, whether commissioned or non-commissioned. The concept was initially frowned upon by Royal Air Force units, but when Air Vice Marshal \\"Mary\\" Coningham dined at the shared mess on 11 October 1941 and gave his approval, it took root across the entire Desert Air Force; leading ace Clive Caldwell later put the same idea into practice as commander of the RAAF's No. 1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory.Alexander, Clive Caldwell, p. 51 One of No. 3 Squadron's flight sergeants recalled that Jeffrey made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship, and also gave one of his senior warrant officers special responsibility for keeping track of the location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency. Having been promoted to temporary wing commander and appointed wing leader of No. 234 Wing RAF earlier in the month, Jeffrey was credited with a share in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter on 20 November. Two days later he was shot down himself, but was uninjured and managed to make his way back to base. On 25 November, above cheering Allied soldiers besieged in Tobruk, Jeffrey led No. 3 Squadron and No. 112 Squadron RAF in an attack on Axis bombers that resulted in seven enemy aircraft being destroyed and eight damaged, against one Tomahawk lost.Odgers, Air Force Australia, p. 81 He scored his fifth solo victory during the engagement, shooting down a Bf 110, and damaged another.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, p. 18 On 30 November, Jeffrey rescued one of his old comrades from No. 3 Squadron, Sergeant Pilot Allan Cameron, who had crash-landed behind enemy lines. Nicknamed \\"Tiny\\", Cameron had the bulkiest frame of any man in the unit, and after landing Jeffrey had to ditch his parachute to make room for his passenger in the Tomahawk's cockpit. He nevertheless managed to take off and return to base, and Cameron went on to survive the war and become an ace in the process.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 206Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, pp. 18–19Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, pp. 122, 142 For this and other achievements Jeffrey was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 12 December 1941. As well as his rescue of the downed pilot, the citation paid tribute to his \\"great success\\" as wing leader, his \\"fine fighting spirit\\" in returning to base after having been shot down himself, and to his \\"magnificent leadership, fearlessness and skill\\" that had \\"contributed in a large measure to the successes achieved\\". At the end of the month, Jeffrey was posted back to Australia to serve in the South West Pacific. He was credited with a total of five aerial victories in the Middle East, plus one shared and one damaged, though he was considered to be \\"conservative\\" in his scoring.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, p. 102 =South West Pacific= Jeffrey arrived in Australia in January 1942, and the following month briefly took charge of RAAF Bankstown, New South Wales. On 4 March he became the inaugural commander of No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron, operating newly delivered P-40 Kittyhawks. Forming the squadron in Townsville, Queensland, Jeffrey was responsible for readying it for the defence of Port Moresby, which would become one of the crucial early battles in the New Guinea campaign.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 139–141Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 458–461 Although it included two other veterans of No. 3 Squadron in the Middle East, Flight Lieutenants \\"Old John\\" Jackson and Peter Turnbull, most of the unit's pilots were untried, and Jeffrey had only nine days to instil in them basic principles of combat flying, gunnery and tactics. He handed over command to Jackson on 19 March, but assisted in ferrying the Kittyhawks to Moresby two days later, only to be fired upon by nervous anti-aircraft gunners as he came in to land with Turnbull and two other pilots. All four aircraft were damaged, and Jeffrey came within inches of death as a bullet flew past his skull and into the headrest of his seat. By 24 March, No. 75 Squadron had already shot down several Japanese raiders; having witnessed it \\"quickly established as a fighting unit\\", Jeffrey returned to Australia.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, p. 50 He immediately began working up a second new Kittyhawk unit for service in New Guinea, No. 76 (Fighter) Squadron. Based in Townsville at this stage, it was subsequently commanded by Peter Turnbull and joined No. 75 Squadron in the Battle of Milne Bay.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 603–605 \\"Bluey\\" Truscott (second from rear), at No. 2 Operational Training Unit, Mildura, in June 1942.alt=Four single-engined military monoplanes in flight In April 1942, Jeffrey was appointed to establish and command No. 2 Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU). Initially based at Port Pirie, South Australia, the unit relocated to Mildura, Victoria, the following month, training pilots for combat in such aircraft as Kittyhawks, CAC Boomerangs and Supermarine Spitfires. Its instructors under Jeffrey included aces Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur.Alexander, Clive Caldwell, p. 99 Jeffrey married Colleen Crozier at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 14 May; his best man was fellow ace and No. 3 Squadron veteran Alan Rawlinson. The couple had two sons. In August 1943, Jeffrey took charge of No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters, based in Darwin, Northern Territory. On 25 September, he took over from Caldwell as Officer Commanding No. 1 (Fighter) Wing, comprising three Spitfire squadrons whose role was to defend North-Western Area (NWA) from air attack.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 104–106Alexander, Clive Caldwell, pp. 151–152 By this time, Japanese raids had declined in strength and frequency, and Allied forces in the NWA shifted from a defensive posture to assaulting Japanese positions in the Dutch East Indies and Western New Guinea.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 120–121 No. 1 Wing intercepted some raiders in late September but none came in October; the last Japanese attack on northern Australia took place on 12 November.Thomas, Spitfire Aces, p. 26 Jeffrey was promoted to temporary group captain in December. On 8 March 1944, Jeffrey urgently dispatched two of his squadrons to the vicinity of Perth, Western Australia, in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid the area, but it proved to be an abortive sortie; no attack ensued, and the squadrons were directed to return to Darwin on 20 March.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 136–139 He led the wing in its first offensive strafing operation on 18 April, attacking Japanese positions in the Babar Islands.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 217 The next month, he deployed his headquarters and two squadrons to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia to protect facilities that had been established to refuel the British Eastern Fleet prior to Operation Transom.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 229 On 5 September 1944, Jeffrey led No. 1 Wing to the Tanimbar Islands and strafed targets in Selaru. Later he discussed the mission with Caldwell, who was then commanding No. 80 (Fighter) Wing and had tagged along to determine if such long-range operations might be worthwhile for his squadrons. Jeffrey declared that the trip was a wasted effort and he had only undertaken it to prevent, in Caldwell's words, \\"the morale of his pilots going completely down the drain\\".Alexander, Clive Caldwell, p. 164 The following month, Jeffrey was recommended to be mentioned in despatches for \\"gallant and distinguished service\\" in North-Western Area; the award was gazetted on 9 March 1945. Departing No. 1 Wing, in November he returned to the command of No. 2 OTU, in which role he saw out the rest of the war. Post-war career Group Captain Jeffrey (extreme left) leading the RAAF's contingent in the alt=Crowd of people watching a parade of military personnel march along a city street Following the cessation of hostilities, No. 2 OTU was reduced to the status of a care-and-maintenance unit, and Jeffrey's commission was terminated on 6 June 1946. Having been transferred to the RAAF reserve upon his demobilisation, he sought readmission to the PAF in August the same year, without success. He then took up farming, purchasing a property on the Murray River.Dornan, Nicky Barr, p. 271 In April 1951 he again applied to rejoin the PAF and this time was granted a commission as a wing commander. Over the next two years he held training posts in Victoria, firstly at the RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, and in 1952 at Central Flying School, East Sale.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 195, 198 The following year he became Deputy Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Raised to acting group captain in February 1954, Jeffrey was appointed Superintendent, Air, with the Long-Range Weapons Establishment in Salisbury, South Australia. Coordinating weapons trials at Woomera Rocket Range, Jeffrey and his support staff were based initially at RAAF Base Mallala but later relocated to Edinburgh airfield, then part of Salisbury and owned by the Department of Supply.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 446–447 On 17 January 1955, he became the inaugural Officer Commanding RAAF Base Edinburgh, and oversaw the transfer of units from Mallala during the year.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 135–137 He handed over command of the base in April 1956, and resigned from the Air Force on 14 May. Returning to private life, Jeffrey settled in Queensland and became partner in a stock broking firm at Surfers Paradise. He later became a grazier, running a sheep and cattle property at Emerald in Queensland's Central Highlands. In 1972 he moved back to Surfers Paradise, where he died on 6 April 1997 at the age of 83, survived by his wife and sons. His obituary in The Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April described him as the \\"archetypal Australian combat leader ... fearless, forthright, unpretentious, caring\\".

Walker, was on leave) at the University of Michigan. He is a graduate of Oberlin College and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was a Guggenheim fellow. He resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He is also a fellow at the Center for Advanced Behavioral Studies at Stanford. He served as Chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan and as President of the Midwest Political Science Association, and has often been a Guest Scholar at the Brookings Institution. Scholarly influence Kingdon is a specialist in American politics, and has written influential books such as Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies, and America the Unusual. Despite critiques of his work being theoretically shaky, the work has retained a prominent place in the policy literature, garnering hundreds of citations since its publication. Core ideas Kingdon argues that the structure of American political institutions, especially Congress, encourages fragmentation and splintering in American national governance. He also believes this occurs more in the United States than elsewhere. In his book Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies he proposed that for an issue to get on the political agenda, three flux must encounter: * The problem; * The solution; * The political will. Effectively, if there is no solution to a problem, it would be impossible to get the political attention. There can be a wonderful idea in the air, but if this is not answering any prominent problem, no political attention will be raised. Finally, there can be a political will to solve a problem, but if no solution is available, nothing will happen. Political will comes from both predictable elements such as post-elections and unpredictable ones like natural disasters. The three flux must encounter in order to get the political attention to use an available solution to solve an existing problem. Individual policy entrepreneurs are needed to build acceptance for solutions and to create couplings between these streams of problems, solutions, and political will. In his book, America the Unusual, Kingdon states that both American institutions and American ideologies are a source of explanation for why the United States differs in its public policy from other Westernized democracies. For example, the United States' relatively small public sector is partially due to the government's restraints placed upon it in the Constitution, but also partially due to Americans' sustained preference for having a limited government. Kingdon stresses the historical consequences of both American institutions and American ideology, and that they have resulted in American citizens persistently holding a \\"right of center\\" position regarding the desired size of the federal government, compared to other developed nations. Kingdon concludes in America the Unusual that United States' lawmakers need to abandon public policy creation beginning with ideology—favoring the use of political pragmatism instead. Creation of new public laws, or edits to the federal budget due to ideological motivations, such as individualism, will be ineffective to combat rising issues such as climate change and population growth in the coming decades, Kingdon argues.

The scheme was invented by , and initially used in the AltaVista search engine to detect duplicate web pages and eliminate them from search results.. It has also been applied in large- scale clustering problems, such as clustering documents by the similarity of their sets of words.. Jaccard similarity and minimum hash values The Jaccard similarity coefficient is a commonly used indicator of the similarity between two sets. Let be a set and and be subsets of , then the Jaccard index is defined to be the ratio of the number of elements of their intersection and the number of elements of their union: : J(A,B) = {{A \\\\cap B}\\\\over{A \\\\cup B}}. This value is 0 when the two sets are disjoint, 1 when they are equal, and strictly between 0 and 1 otherwise. Two sets are more similar (i.e. have relatively more members in common) when their Jaccard index is closer to 1. The goal of MinHash is to estimate quickly, without explicitly computing the intersection and union. Let be a hash function that maps the members of to distinct integers, let be a random permutation of the elements of the set , and for any set define to be the minimal member of with respect to —that is, the member of with the minimum value of . (In cases where the hash function used is assumed to have pseudo-random properties, the random permutation would not be used.) Now, applying to both and , and assuming no hash collisions, we see that the values are equal () if and only if among all elements of A\\\\cup B, the element with the minimum hash value lies in the intersection A\\\\cap B. The probability of this being true is exactly the Jaccard index, therefore: : That is, the probability that is true is equal to the similarity , assuming drawing from a uniform distribution. In other words, if is the random variable that is one when and zero otherwise, then is an unbiased estimator of . has too high a variance to be a useful estimator for the Jaccard similarity on its own, because r is always zero or one. The idea of the MinHash scheme is to reduce this variance by averaging together several variables constructed in the same way. Algorithm =Variant with many hash functions= The simplest version of the minhash scheme uses different hash functions, where is a fixed integer parameter, and represents each set by the values of for these functions. To estimate using this version of the scheme, let be the number of hash functions for which , and use as the estimate. This estimate is the average of different 0-1 random variables, each of which is one when and zero otherwise, and each of which is an unbiased estimator of . Therefore, their average is also an unbiased estimator, and by standard deviation for sums of 0-1 random variables, its expected error is .. Therefore, for any constant there is a constant such that the expected error of the estimate is at most . For example, 400 hashes would be required to estimate with an expected error less than or equal to .05. =Variant with a single hash function= It may be computationally expensive to compute multiple hash functions, but a related version of MinHash scheme avoids this penalty by using only a single hash function and uses it to select multiple values from each set rather than selecting only a single minimum value per hash function. Let be a hash function, and let be a fixed integer. If is any set of or more values in the domain of , define to be the subset of the members of that have the smallest values of . This subset is used as a signature for the set , and the similarity of any two sets is estimated by comparing their signatures. Specifically, let A and B be any two sets. Then is a set of k elements of , and if h is a random function then any subset of k elements is equally likely to be chosen; that is, is a simple random sample of . The subset is the set of members of that belong to the intersection . Therefore, / is an unbiased estimator of . The difference between this estimator and the estimator produced by multiple hash functions is that always has exactly members, whereas the multiple hash functions may lead to a smaller number of sampled elements due to the possibility that two different hash functions may have the same minima. However, when is small relative to the sizes of the sets, this difference is negligible. By standard Chernoff bounds for sampling without replacement, this estimator has expected error , matching the performance of the multiple-hash-function scheme. =Time analysis= The estimator can be computed in time from the two signatures of the given sets, in either variant of the scheme. Therefore, when and are constants, the time to compute the estimated similarity from the signatures is also constant. The signature of each set can be computed in linear time on the size of the set, so when many pairwise similarities need to be estimated this method can lead to a substantial savings in running time compared to doing a full comparison of the members of each set. Specifically, for set size the many hash variant takes time. The single hash variant is generally faster, requiring time to maintain the queue of minimum hash values assuming . Incorporating weights A variety of techniques to introduce weights into the computation of MinHashes have been developed. The simplest extends it to integer weights. Extend our hash function to accept both a set member and an integer, then generate multiple hashes for each item, according to its weight. If item occurs times, generate hashes h(i,1), h(i,2), \\\\ldots, h(i,n). Run the original algorithm on this expanded set of hashes. Doing so yields the weighted Jaccard Index as the collision probability. J_\\\\mathcal{W}(x,y) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i \\\\min(x_i,y_i)}{\\\\sum_i \\\\max(x_i,y_i)} Further extensions that achieve this collision probability on real weights with better runtime have been developed, one for dense data, and another for sparse data. Another family of extensions use exponentially distributed hashes. A uniformly random hash between 0 and 1 can be converted to follow an exponential distribution by CDF inversion. This method exploits the many beautiful properties of the minimum of a set of exponential variables. H(x) = \\\\underset{i}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\frac{-\\\\log(h(i))}{x_i} This yields as its collision probability the probability Jaccard index J_\\\\mathcal{P}(x,y) = \\\\sum_{x_i eq 0, y_i eq 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_{j} \\\\max\\\\left(\\\\frac{x_j}{x_i}, \\\\frac{y_j}{y_i}\\\\right)} Min- wise independent permutations In order to implement the MinHash scheme as described above, one needs the hash function to define a random permutation on elements, where is the total number of distinct elements in the union of all of the sets to be compared. But because there are different permutations, it would require bits just to specify a truly random permutation, an infeasibly large number for even moderate values of . Because of this fact, by analogy to the theory of universal hashing, there has been significant work on finding a family of permutations that is \\"min-wise independent\\", meaning that for any subset of the domain, any element is equally likely to be the minimum. It has been established that a min-wise independent family of permutations must include at least :\\\\operatorname{lcm}(1, 2, \\\\cdots, n) \\\\ge e^{n-o(n)} different permutations, and therefore that it needs bits to specify a single permutation, still infeasibly large. Because of this impracticality, two variant notions of min-wise independence have been introduced: restricted min- wise independent permutations families, and approximate min-wise independent families. Restricted min-wise independence is the min-wise independence property restricted to certain sets of cardinality at most .. Approximate min- wise independence has at most a fixed probability of varying from full independence.. Applications The original applications for MinHash involved clustering and eliminating near-duplicates among web documents, represented as sets of the words occurring in those documents. Similar techniques have also been used for clustering and near-duplicate elimination for other types of data, such as images: in the case of image data, an image can be represented as a set of smaller subimages cropped from it, or as sets of more complex image feature descriptions.; . In data mining, use MinHash as a tool for association rule learning. Given a database in which each entry has multiple attributes (viewed as a 0–1 matrix with a row per database entry and a column per attribute) they use MinHash-based approximations to the Jaccard index to identify candidate pairs of attributes that frequently co-occur, and then compute the exact value of the index for only those pairs to determine the ones whose frequencies of co-occurrence are below a given strict threshold.. The MinHash algorithm has been adapted for bioinformatics, where the problem of comparing genome sequences has a similar theoretical underpinning to that of comparing documents on the web. MinHash-based tools allow rapid comparison of whole genome sequencing data with reference genomes (around 3 minutes to compare one genome with the 90000 reference genomes in RefSeq), and are suitable for speciation and maybe a limited degree of microbial sub-typing. There are also applications for metagenomics and the use of MinHash derived algorithms for genome alignment and genome assembly. Other uses The MinHash scheme may be seen as an instance of locality sensitive hashing, a collection of techniques for using hash functions to map large sets of objects down to smaller hash values in such a way that, when two objects have a small distance from each other, their hash values are likely to be the same. In this instance, the signature of a set may be seen as its hash value. Other locality sensitive hashing techniques exist for Hamming distance between sets and cosine distance between vectors; locality sensitive hashing has important applications in nearest neighbor search algorithms.. For large distributed systems, and in particular MapReduce, there exist modified versions of MinHash to help compute similarities with no dependence on the point dimension. . Evaluation and benchmarks A large scale evaluation has been conducted by Google in 2006 . to compare the performance of Minhash and SimHash. algorithms. In 2007 Google reported using Simhash for duplicate detection for web crawling . and using Minhash and LSH for Google News personalization. .

May 24, 1975. The three-block-long, eight-building complex, which contained luxury condominiums, office space, restaurants, luxury retail space, a boardwalk, and plaza, was the first large-scale redevelopment of Georgetown's waterfront in the city's history. By the end of 1975, The New York Times was reporting that Koubek's firm had designed roughly half the office buildings built in the District of Columbia since the 1950s.Goldberger, Paul. \\"Washington Buildings: Low Profile and Boxlike Design.\\" The New York Times. December 29, 1975. =The Willard renovation= The Annex at the Willard Hotel, with concept by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and implementation by Vlastimil Koubek. In 1974, Koubek was hired to help renovate the long-shuttered, historic Willard Hotel. The original hotel (consisting of six townhouses joined together) was built in 1816, renovated and enlarged by leaseholder Henry Willard in 1847, and the current 12-story structure erected in 1901. Due to mismanagement and competition from more modern hotels, the Willard closed in 1968. With the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, the Willard was threatened repeatedly with demolition. In May 1974, the National Trust for Historic Preservation paid Koubek $25,000 to study saving the hotel, either as a hotel, as a mixed-used structure, or as an office building.Conroy, Sarah Booth. \\"Studying the Fate of the Willard.\\" The Washington Post. May 18, 1974. The Willard's owners, Charles Benenson and Robert Arnow, had earlier commissioned Koubek to design a modern office building for the site which would have required demolition of the structure. Ultimately, the New York City architecture firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates was hired to lead the hotel's rehabilitation and expansion. After this firm pulled out of the project, Koubek executed their concept, overseeing work until the hotel's reopening in 1986.Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site.

Declaring the design worthy of \\"genuine architectural distinction,\\" The Washington Post architectural critic Benjamin Forgey noted that Koubek was responsible for adding the giant ocular windows in the office complex, the marble office entryway with its marble canopy and columns, and the restructuring of the diagonal courtyard between the original hotel and the office additions. Forgey concluded that \\"...a lot of the details, such as the exquisite storefronts or the sequence of pilasters, entablatures and cornices in the same elongated courtyard, are a treat to the eye.\\" Critic Paul Goldberger, writing for The New York Times in 1986, declared the renovation ingenious. In 1988, the Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects gave its 1988 Award for Excellence to Koubek for the Willard Hotel design and renovation. =Other 1970s projects= The historic Car Barn building, renovated by Koubek in 1979–1980 In February 1976, Koubek contributed a third high-rise office building to Farragut Square, this one a brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW.\\"New Building.\\" The Washington Post.

In November 1977, developer Oliver T. Carr proposed tearing down the entire block, which was occupied by the Beaux-Arts Keith-Albee Building and Metropolitan National Bank Building as well as the 180-year-old Rhodes Tavern.McCombs, Paul and Oman, Anne H. \\"$40 Million Mall Is Planned.\\" The Washington Post.

Koubek was a nationally known authority on how to draft construction documents for commercial buildings. He also became a multi-millionaire through his architectural work and through investments.Beale, Betty. \\"Roosevelt Sons Set Aside Differences For Centennial.\\" Birmingham Times Daily. October 20, 1984. Later years and death Although Koubek designed more than 100 apartment buildings, condominiums, hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls during his long career, he did only a handful of private residences.Siegal, Ann Cameron. \\"Tysons Is Close, But Nature Is Closer.\\" The Washington Post. April 17, 2010. He actively continued his architectural career and his office until the end of January 2003. By the time of his passing he had designed buildings representing a combined investment of more than $2 billion. Vlastimil Koubek's marriage to Eva Koubek ended in divorce. He married Peggy Koubek in 1984. Vlastimil Koubek died of cancer on February 15, 2003, at his home in Arlington, Virginia. Design philosophy Koubek's architectural philosophy has been described as cosmetic and practical. Because the height of buildings in D.C. was limited to by law and the cost of land was so high, buildings in the city were built to the maximum size possible.Wheeler, Linda. \\"New Washington Emerges on Downtown K Street.\\" The Washington Post. November 23, 1979. \\"There is nothing left for the architect to do except apply the cosmetics,\\" Koubek said. Koubek limited his \\"cosmetics\\" to the needs and budgets of his clients, often falling back on the design aesthetics of Marcel Breuer, I. M. Pei, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. His work was described as restrained, and an unnamed D.C. city planning official once described Koubek's work as \\"last year's Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.\\" Koubek defended his work from criticisms that it was boxlike, sterile, repetitive, and dull. \\"Good architecture ... has to fit the fabric of the city and be functional inside and make economic sense. The most wonderful building in the world is not going to get built if it will not make money.\\" Others defended his work as well. Oliver T. Carr, chairman of the giant real estate developer CarrAmerica, said, \\"He was good. He was different from so many architects of that time. His buildings had clean architectural lines, and yet they were functional and practical and offered good work space. For that period of time, he was a perfect fit.\\" Koubek did not like mixing older, smaller buildings with his designs. \\"There is no place for big buildings next to little buildings,\\" he told The Washington Post in 1979. He was also critical of Federalist architecture. He once scathingly noted, \\"I think that on Georgetown architecture I'd rather not comment at all. You may quote me on that. I wish you would.\\" Legacy The Koubek Auditorium in the Edward M. Crough Center for Architectural Studies at Catholic University of America is named for Koubek in honor of his many contributions to architectural design.Forgey, Benjamin. \\"CU's Gym-Dandy Transformation.\\" The Washington Post.

FOSS is also an ongoing research project dedicated to improving the learning and teaching of science. History The FOSS K–8 program was developed at the Lawrence Hall of Science, University of California at Berkeley, under three separate National Science Foundation grants (1988FOSS Grades 3–6, NSF Grant MDR-8751727, July 1988 to March 1992 1991,FOSS Grades K–2, NSF Grant MDR-9150097, July 1991 to Dec. 1994 1996.FOSS for Middle School, NSF Grant ESI-9553600, Sept. 1996 to Aug. 2002) The program was originally developed and trial tested in urban and suburban San Francisco Bay Area school districts and field-tested and implemented nationally in ten sites. Twenty-six modules were developed for K–6, and nine courses for middle school. The FOSS K–6 program went through a major revision in 2000 and was then adopted in Texas. The program went through a minor revision in 2005. A new, California specific, edition was developed for the California science adoption (K–5) in 2007. FOSS is currently published by Delta Education, a division of School Specialty Inc. Pedagogy The FOSS program uses several instructional pedagogies: inquiry-based learning (each investigation is guided by questions), hands-on learning and active investigation (students work with materials and conduct investigations to attempt to answer questions), student-to-student interaction, writing (students keep careful notes in science notebooks), and research/reading (readings are included to enhance or underscore active investigation—students work with materials prior to doing any reading). Components Each K–6 module consists of a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, and a student reading book. Each middle school course includes a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, a Science Resources book, a lab notebook, and a course-specific multimedia component. The FOSS website, FOSSweb, contains additional online activities for students and resources for parents and teachers. FOSSweb has two sister sites, FOSSweb CA, for the California 2007 edition, and FOSSweb NYC, for New York City teachers using FOSS. Program Use and Adoption FOSS is in use in every state in the country with over 100,000 teachers and 2 million students and is in approximately 16% of the nation's school districts. FOSS was the first non-textbook curriculum to make the California adoption list (1992) and was adopted in California for the 2007 science adoption (FOSS California K–5). The program is on many state adoption lists and is used in 50 of the 100 largest U.S. school districts. FOSS is cited as an exemplary program in publications by nationally recognized organizations in the science reform movement, including National Science Resources Center,Resources for Teaching Elementary Science, 1996; Science for All Children, 1997 and the National Science Teachers Association.Pathways to the National Standards, 1996 FOSS has been approved as a recommended science program in each of the adoption states in which it has been submitted.

Itapa is one of the goddesses worshipped at Ife. Her festival, known as Utaale, is held for a period of thirty days and she has been worshipped by Ooni and his people till today. Foundation legend and history Amowa and Elepe, sons of Oduduwa, left Ile-ife (Ife) with their mother and two friends known as Elemo and Baaro. These people were hunters. At some stage Elepe took his leave and settled at one of Itapa's farms called Osin. Another brother of Amowa settled in a farm in Itapa called Ijelu, and he later became Elejelu. Amowa was the first Olosin of Osin. There are other gods called Elutapa and Orisa Itapa worshipped by Ooni and still worshipped today. Owa attends these gods through his elected priests called Ayaya as the priest of Elutapa and Aworo Orisa Ilawe as the priest of Orisa Itapa or Ilawe. Elemo took his quarter and become the head of Remo while Baaro became head of Egetun. All of them were great hunters. Many people came to settle with them and they became prosperous.

He was last seen alive in a prison in Bijeljina in September 1995 after which his fate remained a mystery for 14 years. On 5 August 2009, it was announced that his remains had been found back in November 2001 but were not positively identified using DNA profiling until July 2009. Early life Avdo Palić was born in the village of Krivača in the municipality of Han Pijesak in north-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, into a Muslim Bosniak family. Prior to the war he served in the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) as a reserve artillery officer and was a graduate of the Yugoslav military academy and the University of Sarajevo. He made his living as an engineer and high school teacher in Vlasenica. Bosnian War During the war Avdo and Esma Palić married; the couple had two daughters. Esma came to Žepa, her hometown on 29 March 1992, to visit her relatives. Her future husband joined her shortly thereafter, when he came to visit his father in Vlasenica. When the war started in early April, Vlasenica fell to the Serb forces and Palić came to Žepa, where he became the commander of the local unit of the Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and subsequently the commander of all Bosnian government forces in the area (which would eventually become known as the ARBiH 285th Light Mountain Brigade). On 4 June 1992, a 40-vehicle convoy of JNA troops was sent from Pale to occupy Žepa. As it passed through a canyon on the way to the town it was ambushed by Palić and his men. The defenders of Žepa were not adequately armed and equipped to stop the convoy so they also dislodged boulders and rolled logs down into the canyon in effort to stop the attack. Forty-five JNA soldiers were killed and another 31 were captured. All of the captured Serb soldiers were later exchanged for food. Following that unsuccessful attempt to occupy Žepa the Serbs laid siege for the next three years. The Žepa enclave was in a remote, mountainous and heavily forested area and was completely surrounded by the Republika Srpska rebel army which regularly and indiscriminately shelled the enclave. Žepa was entirely dependent on outside supplies of food and medicine which were supposed to be delivered by the Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeepers, but the deliveries were consistently obstructed by the Serbs. Nevertheless, the defenders of Žepa were able to hold out in spite of a severe lack of weapons and ammunition. Nearly all of their weapons were captured from the enemy or were smuggled in on foot or by helicopter from the Bosnian government controlled areas. On 6 May 1993, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 824. The resolution declared six areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina including Žepa, as \\"safe areas\\" and declared that they \\"should be free from armed attacks and any other hostile act\\". After the passage of the resolution the Žepa enclave was demilitarized and a contingent of UNPROFOR troops from Ukraine was stationed there. The ARBiH forces turned over most of their weapons to the UNPROFOR in exchange for UN guarantees to protect the enclave in the event of an attack. However the shelling as well as other offensive actions against Žepa continued. In early 1995 the Serbs stepped up military operations against the eastern Bosnian enclaves of Srebrenica and Žepa. In March 1995 the President of Republika Srpska, Radovan Karadžić, issued a directive concerning the long-term strategy of the VRS forces in the region. The directive, known as Directive 7, specified that the Serb forces were to \\"complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from Žepa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves. By planned and well-thought out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica\\". Between 6–11 July 1995 the Serbs overran the enclave of Srebrenica and committed the notorious Srebrenica massacre, summarily executing thousands of Bosnian prisoners of war and male civilians. Following that, they turned their sights on Žepa. Knowing that his men were outnumbered, outgunned and low on ammunition, Col. Palić sought to negotiate a withdrawal and spare the 30,000 people in Žepa the fate of the massacre victims in Srebrenica. He first escorted his family to safety and returned to Žepa to secure safe passage for everybody else. While he negotiated his men hid in the forests around Žepa and began to make their way to areas such as Tuzla, Goražde and other Bosnian government controlled areas; many civilians also escaped. By engaging in negotiation he was able to give the people of Žepa time to escape and another massacre was avoided. During his meetings with Serb officers he was supposedly under the protection of the UN. Death On 27 July 1995, Palić went to a meeting with senior Serb and UN officials, among whom was General Ratko Mladić, the chief commander of the Bosnian Serb army. At the meeting he was seized by the Serbs. Abdurahman Malkić and Sado Ramić, two Bosniak prisoners from Srebrenica confirmed that they were held at the same prison as Palić in Bijeljina until late August 1995. However, the two men were transferred to another prison and eventually released after the signing of the Dayton Accords. The Republika Srpska government has concluded that on 5 September 1995 a VRS military officer came to the prison in Bijeljina and took Palić with him, after which he was never seen again. Since the end of the war through the day that the remains of Palić were positively identified his widow Esma campaigned to force the government of Republika Srpska to investigate the case, locate the remains and prosecute the killers. During the campaign Esma Palić has filed lawsuits in the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Court of Human Rights in Strassburg. She has also petitioned the Office of the High Representative in Sarajevo. Amnesty International and other human rights groups have also made efforts to get publicize the case. In January 2002 the government of Republika Srpska paid Esma Palic 65,000 KM in compensation. The remains of Palić and eight other men were found in a mass grave near the village of Vragolovi in the municipality of Rogatica, near Žepa in November 2001. The remains were prepared for DNA analysis in June 2002. The first attempt to match the DNA from the remains to DNA samples provided by Palić's sister and daughters as well as samples extracted from the remains of Palić's father who died in 1992 were unsuccessful. The reason for the failed identification was that the sample did not yield enough genetic materials for a match.ICMP on Colonel Palic , International Commission on Missing Persons, 5 August 2009. Starting in November 2008 the laboratory charged with identifying the remains of people killed during the war began to reexamine all remains that had not been matched to any DNA samples provided by relatives in the database. A second analysis of Palić's remains was conducted in late July 2009 using more sophisticated methods and yielded a positive match. Since 2002, the remains had been buried in a cemetery for unidentified victims of the war in Visoko. In light of the second, positive match, Palić's body was re-exhumed on 12 August 2009, and sent for a third analysis at the request of Esma Palić.Jucer na visockom groblju reekshumiran NN6, Oslobođenje, 13 August 2009.

The strip is lined with numerous Middle Eastern restaurants, bakeries, clothing stores, and markets selling Halal meat. The Karbalaa Islamic Education Center, housed in a former nightclub that had been damaged by fire, contains approximately of space that have been converted into a prayer room, offices, an all-purpose meeting room, an audio-visual room, kitchen, and an area to hold a weekend school for children.  Membership and history  Those affiliated with the center are largely of Iraqi and Lebanese descent, both recent immigrants and individuals who have been in the country for a considerable period of time. Much of the Iraqi community in Detroit was formed as individuals and families (Iraqi Americans) sought refuge from Saddam Hussein following the Gulf War. One of the founders of the Karbalaa Islamic Education Center, Imam Husham Alhusainy, arrived in the late 1970s, but did not start the Karbalaa Center until 1994. He and others bought space for the mosque, which presently has approximately 150-200 people affiliated with it.  Activities  There are prayer services daily in the evening, and on Fridays at noon and in the evening. Other activities at the center include women's meetings, which are held in conjunction with similar woman's groups from other nearby mosques, including the Islamic Center of America, and the Islamic Institute of Knowledge. The center sponsors occasional religious discussions, \\"Meeting for Better Understanding,\\" at which times Christians and Muslims come together to exchange ideas on different topics from the two groups' perspectives in order to promote understanding and tolerance. Discussion topics have included the unity of God, the nature of sin and morality, and the truth of Bible and the Qur'an. The Karbalaa Education Center sponsors a weekend school for children with classes in Arabic, the Qur'an, and Arabic culture and history.  In the community  There is a museum dedicated to Islam, and a library with books and newspapers in Arabic. The center serves a vital function in the community by sponsoring Iraqi refugees and helping these newly arrivals to adjust to life in the United States and become oriented to the Detroit community. In addition, it provides a link to other mosques in the area, thereby keeping the community tightly knit and reinforcing Middle Eastern culture.

Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) provides a novel contrast mechanism in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) different from traditional Susceptibility Weighted Imaging.1st International Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping, Jena (2011)2nd International Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast & Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping, Cornell (2013)3rd International Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast & Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping, Duke (2014)4th International Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast & Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping, Graz (2016) The voxel intensity in QSM is linearly proportional to the underlying tissue apparent magnetic susceptibility, which is useful for chemical identification and quantification of specific biomarkers including iron, calcium, gadolinium, and super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nano- particles. QSM utilizes phase images, solves the magnetic field to susceptibility source inverse problem, and generates a three-dimensional susceptibility distribution. Due to its quantitative nature and sensitivity to certain kinds of material, potential QSM applications include standardized quantitative stratification of cerebral microbleeds and neurodegenerative disease, accurate gadolinium quantification in contrast enhanced MRI, and direct monitoring of targeted theranostic drug biodistribution in nanomedicine.  Background  A visualization of the cone in Fourier domain. In MRI, the local field \\\\delta B induced by non-ferromagnetic biomaterial susceptibility along the main polarization B₀ field is the convolution of the volume susceptibility distribution \\\\chi with the dipole kernel d: \\\\delta B = d \\\\otimes \\\\chi. This spatial convolution can be expressed as a point-wise multiplication in Fourier domain: \\\\Delta B = D \\\\cdot \\\\Chi. This Fourier expression provides an efficient way to predict the field perturbation when the susceptibility distribution is known. However, the field to source inverse problem involves division by zero at a pair of cone surfaces at the magic angle with respect to B₀ in the Fourier domain. Consequently, susceptibility is underdetermined at the spatial frequencies on the cone surface, which often leads to severe streaking artifacts in the reconstructed QSM.  Techniques  = Data acquisition = In principle, any 3D gradient echo sequence can be used for data acquisition. In practice, high resolution imaging with a moderately long echo time is preferred to obtain sufficient susceptibility effects, although the optimal imaging parameters depend on the specific applications and the field strength. A multi-echo acquisition is beneficial for accurate B₀ field measurement without the contribution from B1 inhomogeneity. Flow compensation may further improve the accuracy of susceptibility measurement in venous blood, but there are certain technical difficulties to devise a fully flow compensated multi-echo sequence. = Background field removal = Estimated local field maps using Left) high-pass filtering method, Right) Projection onto Dipole Fields (PDF) method. In human brain quantitative susceptibility mapping, only the local susceptibility sources inside the brain are of interest. However, the magnetic field induced by the local sources is inevitably contaminated by the field induced by other sources such as main field inhomogeneity (imperfect shimming) and the air- tissue interface, whose susceptibility difference is orders of magnitudes stronger than that of the local sources. Therefore, the non-biological background field needs to be removed for clear visualization on phase images and precise quantification on QSM. Ideally, the background field can be directly measured with a separate reference scan, where the sample of interest is replaced by a uniform phantom with the same shape while keeping the scanner shimming identical. However, for clinical application, such an approach is impossible and post-processing based methods are preferred. Traditional heuristic methods, including high-pass filtering, are useful for the background field removal, although they also tamper with the local field and degrade the quantitative accuracy. More recent background field removal methods directly or indirectly exploit the fact that the background field is a harmonic function. Two recent methods which are based on physical principles, Projection onto Dipole Fields (PDF) and Sophisticated Harmonic Artifact Reduction on Phase data (SHARP), demonstrated improved contrast and higher precision on the estimated local field. Both methods model the background field as a magnetic field generated by an unknown background susceptibility distribution, and differentiate it from the local field using either the approximate orthogonality or the harmonic property. The background field can also be directly computed by solving the Laplace's equation with simplified boundary values, as demonstrated in the Laplacian boundary value (LBV) method. = Field-to-source inversion = The field-to-source inverse problem can be solved by several methods with various associated advantages and limitations.  Calculation Of Susceptibility through Multiple Orientation Sampling (COSMOS) The first QSM image reconstructed using COSMOS to quantify gadolinium concentrations in vials. a)magnitude image; b)field map; c)QSM; d)linear regression.COSMOS solves the inverse problem by oversampling from multiple orientations. COSMOS utilizes the fact that the zero cone surface in the Fourier domain is fixed at the magic angle with respect to the B₀ field. Therefore, if an object is rotated with respect to the B₀ field, then in the object's frame, the B₀ field is rotated and thus the cone. Consequently, data that cannot be calculated due to the cone becomes available at the new orientations. COSMOS assumes a model-free susceptibility distribution and keeps full fidelity to the measured data. This method has been validated extensively in in vitro, ex vivo and phantom experiments. Quantitative susceptibility maps obtained from in vivo human brain imaging also showed high degree of agreement with previous knowledge about brain anatomy. Three orientations are generally required for COSMOS, limiting the practicality for clinical applications. However, it may serve as a reference standard when available for calibrating other techniques.  Morphology Enabled Dipole Inversion (MEDI) A unique advantage of MRI is that it provides not only the phase image but also the magnitude image. In principle, the contrast change, or equivalently the edge, on a magnitude image arises from the underlying change of tissue type, which is the same cause for the change of susceptibility. This observation is translated into mathematics in MEDI, where edges in a QSM which do not exist in the corresponding magnitude image are sparsified by solving a weighted l_1 norm minimization problem. MEDI has also been validated extensively in phantom, in vitro and ex vivo experiments. In in vivo human brain, MEDI calculated QSM showed similar results compared to COSMOS without statistically significant difference. MEDI only requires a single angle acquisition, so it is a more practical solution to QSM.  Thresholded K-space Division (TKD) The underdetermined data in Fourier domain is only at the location of the cone and its immediate vicinity. For this region in k-space, spatial-frequencies of the dipole kernel are set to a predetermined non-zero value for the division. Investigation of more advanced strategies for recovering data in this k-space region is also a topic of ongoing research. Thresholded k-space division only requires a single angle acquisition, and benefits from the ease of implementation as well as the fast calculation speed. However, streaking artifacts are frequently present in the QSM and the susceptibility value is underestimated compared to COSMOS calculated QSM.  Potential clinical applications  = Differentiating calcification from iron = Differentiation between calcification and iron. From left to right are magnitude, phase and QSM. It has been confirmed in in vivo and phantom experiments that cortical bones, whose major composition is calcification, are diamagnetic compared to water. Therefore, it is possible to use this diamagnetism to differentiate calcifications from iron deposits that usually demonstrate strong paramagnetism. This may allow QSM to serve as a problem solving tool for the diagnosis of confounding hypointense findings on T2* weighted images. = Quantification of contrast agent = For exogenous susceptibility sources, the susceptibility value is theoretically linearly proportional to the concentration of the contrast agent. This provides a new way for in vivo quantification of gadolinium or SPIO concentrations.

It is the installation management authority for both Andersen Air Force Base (Andersen AFB) and Naval Base Guam (USNB Guam). Its headquarters is located halfway between the two installations, on Nimitz Hill. The command is an amalgamation of the United States Navy (USN) USNB Guam and the United States Air Force (USAF) Andersen AFB which were merged on October 1, 2009.Joint Region Marianas Official Website  History  JRM was established in accordance with congressional legislation implementing the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The legislation ordered the consolidation of facilities which were adjoining, but separate military installations, into a single joint base, one of 12 formed in the United States as a result of the law. On February 6, 2009, the Navy and Air Force held a groundbreaking ceremony for a combined headquarters at Nimitz Hill, signaling the beginning of Joint Region Marianas. Joint Region Marianas began initial operational capability on Jan. 31, 2009, and reached full operational capability on October 1, 2009. Under Joint Region Marianas, USNB Guam and Andersen AFB will each maintain commanding officers, who will oversee their respective mission requirements and operations. Joint Region Marianas will oversee support services, policies, and resources. Joint Region Marianas is symbolic of the historic partnership between the Navy and Air Force on Guam, bridging the approximately 30 miles between USNB Guam and Andersen AFB. The commander of Joint Region Marianas also serves as commander of U.S. Naval Forces Marianas and as U.S. Defense Representative to Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Republic of Palau, and Federated States of Micronesia. Naval Base Guam USNB Guam is home of Commander Submarine Squadron 15, Coast Guard Sector Guam and Naval Special Warfare Unit One and supports 28 other tenant commands. It is the home base of dozens of Pacific Command, United States Pacific Fleet, and Seventh Fleet units. Submarine Squadron 15 consists of s , and the submarine tender . Andersen Air Force Base Andersen AFB is one of four bomber forward operating locations in the air force. These locations provide forward support to bomber crews deploying overseas in Europe, Southwest Asia and in the Pacific. The air force is establishing forward-deployed bomber beddown support at key locations throughout the world and Andersen is one of two critical bases in the Asia Pacific region. The other location is Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Guam's almost unrestricted airspace and the close proximity of the Farallon de Medinilla Island, a naval bombing range approximately north, makes this an ideal training environment. =Units= Andersen is home to the following units: * 36th Wing (PACAF) * 734th Air Mobility Support Squadron (Air Mobility Command) * Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty-Five (HSC-25) **HSC-25 is a U.S. Navy squadron flying the MH-60S See also *Ordnance Annex *List of United States Navy installations#Guam References * External links *Official Website *Military: Naval Air Station, Agana (Tiyan) (closed).

The subsidiary of the league was founded in 1963 to maintain control of the brands of the league and its franchises and to license and negotiate with vendors to create official NFL merchandise. The NFL Properties head office is located in New York City. Team NFL Heroes \\"mascot\\" program A line of mascot-like characters representing each team in the NFL was developed by NFL Properties in the early 1990s. Named \\"Team NFL Heroes\\", various types of merchandise such as stuffed dolls, school supplies, t-shirts, and lamps featuring the characters were manufactured and marketed mainly to children and teenagers. Mascot costumes of each character were created and people wearing these costumes made an appearance at the 1995 Pro Bowl.https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bizarre-nfl-mascots- from-1995-2013-12#/#the-atlanta-falcons-mascot-had-an-absurdly-long-neck-1 (Pictures of the costumes at the game can be seen online.) Most of the Team NFL Heroes characters only lasted a season or two but a handful ended up being adopted as official mascots by their respective teams, either immediately after the Team NFL Heroes project was canceled or years later; Revere, the New England Patriots Team NFL Hero (name later changed to Pat Patriot after becoming the team's live mascot), is an example of the former while Miles the Denver Broncos Team NFL Hero is an example of the latter. During the Team NFL Heroes campaign the Green Bay Packers had a bear for a mascot despite their arch rivals being the Chicago Bears. Specifically a polar bear, the Packers' Team NFL Hero's name was \\"Bayer\\", a play on Green Bayer (meaning a citizen of Green Bay, Wisconsin) while simultaneously being a homonym of \\"bear\\". Comic books The NFL branched out into comic books in the early 1990s when Marvel Comics created the character NFL SuperPro. The comic book and character was widely panned and only 12 issues of the comic book were printed. The NFL also promoted SuperPro at some events by using a mascot. Video games Long before video games, The National Football League began licensing Electric Football in 1967. The Game was produced by Tudor Games. There have been several American football video games based on NFL teams created for various consoles and computers over the years, from NFL Pro League by Micro Sports Inc. to 10-Yard Fight and the Tecmo Bowl series for the NES to the more well known Madden series that have been released annually since 1988. The Madden series is named after former coach and American football commentator John Madden. Prior to the 2005–2006 football season, other NFL games were produced by competing video game publishers, such as 2K Games and Midway Games. However, in December 2004, Electronic Arts signed a five-year exclusive agreement with the NFL, meaning only Electronic Arts will be permitted to publish games featuring NFL team and player names. This prompted video game developer Midway Games to release a game in 2005 called Blitz: The League, with fictitious teams and players. In February 2008, EA Sports renewed their exclusivity agreement with the league through Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. According to The Sporting News, as of October 2015 \\"it’s not publicly known when, or if, the contract will end.\\"http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/madden-nfl-16-ea-ssports- competition-nfl-2k-take-two-sports-video- games/w5q934xma88113pdihykd5aelhttp://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/20/ea- has-exclusive-license-from-nfl-for-a-couple-more-years/ Legal issues NFL Properties was taken to court by former supplier American Needle, Inc over antitrust violations. The issue was NFL Properties granting exclusive license to one supplier over making a product. Court decisions varied on whether the league and it franchises were acting as a single entity, or whether franchises were competing with each other off the field in merchandising sales. The case was eventually appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court.

The band formed in Hollywood, California in 2010. They have released three albums, The Bomb Shelter Sessions (2011), The Swing House Acoustic Sessions (2014) and 1 Hopeful Rd. (2015). Their sound has been described as \\"retro\\", reminiscent of a number of late 1950s and 1960s blues and rock artists, such as The Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry and The Animals. One of their more well known songs called \\"Today is Pretty Great\\" was featured in a Honda Civic commercial with the artists seen at the very beginning for a few seconds. History Ty Taylor (vocals) and Nalle Colt (guitar) formed Vintage Trouble after setting up a basic home studio in Venice Beach. They invited their mutual friend Rick Barrio Dill to play bass for the band, and then recruited Richard Danielson to play drums. \\"We got together in 2010,\\" Taylor told Billboard. \\"It was one of those experiences where everything was lined up. We had all been friends, and had known each other before the band started up. We had known each other in different arenas. I had known Nalle Colt for about fourteen years, and we had tried to play with each other for so long. We were in one right before Vintage Trouble, and things just weren't working out. So, we left, and decided we wanted to do something a little more raw and down to earth.\\" Taylor has said that the line-up of Colt, Danielson, Barrio Dill and himself developed a good chemistry: \\"It just felt like we were in a family of people that were going to challenge us.\\" The band then began creating material in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. After just two weeks of rehearsals in early 2010, the group began playing local area shows and late night speakeasies. Aiming to emulate mid-century soul music and to use the recording techniques of that era, the band spent a three-day session recording complete takes, turning out 12 new songs for the album \\"The Bomb Shelter Sessions\\". Such singles as '\\"Gracefully\\", \\"Nancy Lee\\", \\"Still & Always Will\\" and \\"Blues Hand Me Down\\" aimed to produce a sound reminiscent of the days of vinyl records and juke joints, and the essence of the original soul movement. The album was produced by Peter McCabe and co-produced by Vintage Trouble themselves. The album was mixed by Rogers Masson. How and where the band launched their career in earnest is an important part of their story. They initially took their music outside the USA, as part of a strategy conceived by legendary manager Doc McGhee. \\"If you look at the history of people like Amy Winehouse, Duffy, or James Blunt, they came [to America] first and didn't make it. Then, they went back over to England, and blew up. We just decided to go to Europe first, and when they were accepted there, we would have a story to share here. That's basically what happened.\\" McGhee wanted to get them in front of as many people as possible, and the strategy worked. \\"It was pretty simple. The concept was to get all the Troublemakers together, and those people spread the word. We got Brian May to give us some dates, and also some stadium shows with Bon Jovi. It's just hard work by these guys. They just get up in the morning, and go conquer,\\" he said. Colt and Taylor at Fibbers in 2011 After three shows in the UK in early 2011, the band returned in April of that year to appear on Jools Holland's late night TV show Later... with Jools Holland. The band became the 6th most trending topic of the day on Twitter, attained the #13 best selling digital album on iTunes, and had the #5 all around best selling digital album on Amazon UK, beating out both Rihanna and the current Glee (TV series) albums. Additionally, VT had the #2 best selling digital Rock album on Amazon.com UK, and the #1 best selling R&B; digital album on Amazon UK. On the 24th April 2011, they appeared on The Late Show with JoAnne Good, (Sunday Night Sessions segment) on BBC London 94.9. The band joined Brian May (guitar player of rock band Queen) and Kerry Ellis for a tour starting in early May 2011, and in June 2011 supported rock band Bon Jovi on the UK leg of their The Circle Tour. On November 12, the band played at Malsis School, a private prep in North Yorkshire, England. The headmaster invited the band after seeing them on Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two. The band played for Paul Stanley on January 20, 2012 at his 60th birthday party and Stanley sang \\"You Shook Me\\" by Willie Dixon.

The competing teams in the 18th edition of the Liberty Bowl were the Alabama Crimson Tide, representing the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the UCLA Bruins, representing the Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8). Alabama won the game, 36–6. Teams =Alabama= The 1976 Alabama squad finished the regular season with a 9–3 record. The Crimson Tide opened the season ranked #6 only to lose to Ole Miss in their opening game, to eventual conference champion Georgia and to Notre Dame. Following their victory over Auburn, Alabama accepted an invitation to play in the Liberty Bowl. The appearance marked the third for Alabama in the Liberty Bowl, and their 30th overall bowl game appearance. =UCLA= Entering their final regular season game against rival USC, the Bruins were ranked #2 with their only blemish on the season coming in a tie against Ohio State. With a berth in the Rose Bowl Game at stake, UCLA was upset 24–14 resulting in the Bruins accepting a bid to play in the Liberty Bowl. The appearance marked the first for UCLA in the Liberty Bowl, and both their 8th overall bowl game and their first away from the Rose Bowl. (the Pacific-8 repealed its \\"Rose Bowl or no bowl\\" rule in 1975). Game summary After forcing a UCLA punt on the opening possession, Alabama took a 3–0 lead on a 37-yard Bucky Berrey field goal on their first offensive possession. On the ensuing UCLA drive, Bama linebacker Barry Krauss intercepted a Jeff Dankworth pass and returned it 44-yards for a touchdown. The following kickoff was fumbled by Wally Henry of UCLA with Alabama recovering. Five plays later Johnny Davis scored on a run from two yards out and the Crimson Tide were up 17–0 after the first quarter. The only points of the second quarter came on an Alabama trick play. Jack O'Rear took the snap and tossed the ball to halfback Tony Nathan who proceeded to pass it back to O'Rear who made the reception and took it 20 yards for a touchdown and a 24–0 lead. Alabama extended their lead to 30–0 with a pair of Berrey field goals before UCLA got on the scoreboard. Theotis Brown scored the Bruins' only points on a 61-yard touchdown run. Alabama responded with their final points with only :22 seconds remaining in the game on a 1-yard Rick Watson run making the final score 36–6. Aftermath Alabama played in five consecutive New Year's Day bowl games following its Liberty Bowl rout of UCLA. The Crimson Tide won national championships in 1978 and 1979 with Sugar Bowl victories over Penn State and Arkansas, respectively. The Tide returned to the Liberty Bowl in 1982 in what turned out to be the final game of Bear Bryant's coaching career. Alabama defeated Illinois 21-15 for Bryant's 232nd victory at his alma mater and 323rd overall. Bryant died of a massive heart attack in Tuscaloosa on January 26, 1983, at age 69, 28 days after coaching his last game. UCLA has yet to return to the Liberty Bowl. The Pacific-8 Conference, which became the Pacific-10 in 1978 with the addition of Arizona and Arizona State, did not send another team to the Liberty Bowl until 1995, when Stanford lost to East Carolina.

Developed between 1836 and the early 20th century, it is one Portland's oldest preserved spaces, with landscaping by the Olmsted Brothers, who included it in their master plan for the city's parks. The promenade was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The West Mansion, designed by Portland architect Frederick A. Tompson (1857–1919), stands at 181 Western Promenade, at its junction with Carroll Street. It was built for the family of George Fletcher West in 1911 at a cost of $100,000; it is now valued at around $2.5 million.\\"THIS PLACE MATTERS: THE WEST MANSION\\" - Portland Landmarks It has nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms The Western Promenade occupies land overlooking a bluff on the west side of the Portland peninsula. It is bounded on the north by the Maine Medical Center complex, the east by the Western Cemetery and a historic 19th-century residential neighborhood (listed on the National Register as the Western Promenade Historic District), and the west by Valley Street. The park is now over in size, and basically linear in shape. The park provides views to the west which include the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The steep slope of the bluff is wooded, except for a section near West Street where a trail is cut down to Valley Street. The network of trails on the bluff is essentially that laid out by John C. Olmsted in 1905. The city began acquiring land on the peninsula's western bluff as early as 1836, since it had long been recognized for its scenery and views, and there was public pressure for increased open space on the increasingly urbanized peninsula. At some point a tree-lined drive was built along the bluff. Beginning in the late 1870s, city engineer William Goodwin championed efforts to further improve the park. In the 1890s and 1900s, Mayor James Phinney Baxter engineered the expansion of the park to its present dimensions, and hired the Olmsted Brothers to oversee a landscaping plan for the park, and to develop a master plan for the city's parks. Design work on the Western Promenade is credited to John C. Olmsted and Henry Vincent Hubbard, then an apprentice with the Olmsted firm.

This area of architecturally distinctive homes was home to three of the city's most prominent architects: Francis H. Fassett, John Calvin Stevens, and Frederick A. Tompson, and was Portland's most fashionable neighborhood in the late 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history Prior to about 1850, much of Portland's development took place in the central portion of the Portland peninsula, whose western end was somewhat swampy. Most of the southwestern portion of the peninsula, between Danforth and Congress Streets, was owned by J.B. Brown, who in the mid-1850s built a large mansion house (called \\"Bramhall\\"). The city had in 1836 acquired some land at the western escarpment, and established the Western Promenade, a public park, and the Western Cemetery had been established in the late 18th century. In the 1860s the city began to grow westward, and Brown platted out a road network and began selling off building lots, draining and filling the swampy areas. Prominent among the purchasers of land in the area was Francis H. Fassett, the city's leading architect of the second half of the 19th century. His own home stands at 117–119 Pine Street, and he is credited with a significant number of designs in the neighborhood. Fassett was a mentor to John Calvin Stevens, who lived on Bowdoin Street. His house is a notable early example of the Shingle style, which Stevens had a major role in promoting, and his designs are also found throughout the area. The historic district is bounded on the west by the Western Promenade, the north by Bramhall and Brackett Streets, on the south by Danforth Street, and the east by a ragged line that roughly includes Clark, Cushman, and Emery Streets. There are 420 buildings in the district, representing a diversity of architectural styles which were popular between 1850 and 1920. There are high- quality architect-designed examples of Second Empire, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Shingle styles, with a particularly fine row of houses facing the Western Promenade. Among those is the Adam P. Leighton House, a fine Italianate mansion designed by Frederick A. Tompson for Adam Leighton, a Portland businessman and mayor who is credited with inventing the postcard.

The casemate was part of an extension of the Maginot Line fortifications along France's border with Germany. As a unit of the Fortified Sector of Colmar, the casemate was part of French defenses during the German assault of 15–18 June 1940, Operation Kleiner Bär. It has been preserved and is part of a museum focusing on the Rhine section of the Maginot Line. The museum is located at the eastern edge of the town of Marckolsheim. Concept and design Marckolsheim Sud's numerical designator was 35/3, referring to its place in the third, or \\"village\\" line of fortifications, about back from the river bank. It was built in the mid-1930s by the Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées (CORF), which was responsible for the major fortifications of the Maginot Line.Mary, Tome 3, p. 146 Unlike other portions of the Maginot Line, the Rhine defenses were not interconnected, consisting of individual casemates or blockhouses a few hundred meters apart, arranged to fire along the length of the defended frontier. The Marckolsheim Sud casemate is a double casemate, designed to fire laterally in either direction along the front, supporting its neighbors to the north and south. The position was armed with two twin heavy machine guns, type JM and, two 47mm anti-tank gun/JM combinations, one of each firing laterally. The faces of these firing positions were defended by two automatic rifle embrasures. A further automatic rifle position defended the casemate's entrance. On top of the fort, two cupolas or cloches were situated to fire in all directions, with a JM cloche mounted centrally and a GFM automatic rifle cloche to one side. The Marckolsheim Sud casemate, and its companion, Marckolsheim Nord, were not typical of the sector, being somewhat larger than most, with two cloches rather than the usual single GFM cloche. The design category was \\"SBFM special.\\"=Mary, Tome 2, p. 14 1940 :See Fortified Sector of Colmar for a broader discussion of the Colmar sector of the French defenses. JM machine gun Marckolsheim Sud was commanded in 1940 by Lieutenant Marois of the French 42nd Fortress Infantry Regiment. On 15–17 June, the sector was attacked by German forces of the German 360th Infantry Regiment, 221st Infantry Division. Marckolsheim Sud and Nord put up particularly fierce resistance to German attack. The Germans brought up 8.8 cm guns, disabling one cloche, and called in Stuka attacks, which buried the other in debris from bomb blasts. Without the means to defend itself in all directions, and with German assault teams throwing explosives into the casemate openings, the garrison was forced to surrender on the 17th.Romanych, pp. 88–90 Museum Automatic rifle embrasure Marckolsheim Sud was restored in 1972Kaufmann 2011, p. 181 and houses a museum, the Musée Mémorial de la Ligne Maginot du Rhin.

Benzene pollution in Sand Creek In November 2011, a local fisherman noticed an oily sheen on the surface of Sand Creek. Testing found the water of Sand Creek to be contaminated with abnormal levels of the aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene. The source of the benzene was a damaged pipe at the nearby Suncor refinery, from which benzene had seeped into the groundwater and surfaced at Sand Creek. In December 2011, the Colorado Department of Health and Environment began to monitor benzene levels at the junction of Sand Creek and the South Platte River. The results showed benzene levels ranging from 140 ppb to 730 ppb – far above the national EPA limit of 5 ppb. Further downriver in the South Platte, benzene levels were also found to be significantly elevated, ranging from 130 ppb to 190 ppb.Finley, Bruce (January 21, 2012). \\"Toxics from Suncor refinery spill still seeping into water; Colorado vows to 'accelerate' response\\".

In Upper Egypt and near Giza, the Army Aviation and the Air Force used helicopters and fighter jets to attack the rebelling conscripts, causing many deaths. At least four to five helicopters, and three fighter jets, were used in the operation.

In most cases, joint bases have interservice support agreements (ISSAs) to govern how the host provides services to the tenants.DODI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support, August 9, 1995 The practice originated during Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), 1993, in which joint reserve bases were established at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and Fort Worth, Texas. Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 added to this list when 26 bases were combined into twelve and renamed as joint bases. In addition, several other uses of the term \\"joint\\" are used in names of bases in the United States military and are described below. BRAC 1993 joint reserve bases JRBs at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and Fort Worth, Texas, were created during BRAC 1993; however, the name Joint Reserve Base was not used in the BRAC law. Instead, the BRAC realigned several reserve air assets to Carswell AFB (now NAS JRB Fort Worth) and NAS Willow Grove.BRAC 1993 Law It is not clear how or when these bases acquired the Joint Reserve Base name. The JRBs are examples of typical military host–tenant relationships, in which support provided to the tenants by the host is codified in an ISSA as dictated by DOD Policy. At NAS JRB Fort Worth, the Navy hosts a variety of reserve flying units from the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force; each has an ISSA with the Navy for the support it needs at the base. BRAC 2005 joint bases The joint basing program, established by recommendation 146 of the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, represents the department's efforts to optimize the delivery of installation support across the services. The BRAC Report created 12 joint bases from 26 service installations that were in close proximity or shared a boundary. As of 1 October 2010, all 12 joint bases achieved full operational capability. = Supporting and supported component agreements = Joint basing is not governed by the standard host–tenant ISSA policy, DODI 4000.19. Joint basing is instead governed by a memorandum of agreement between each joint base's supporting component, which provides installation support, and supported components, which receive installation support. BRAC 2005 law identified the supported component by requiring that its base realign the \\"relocating the installation management functions to\\" the supporting component. Guidance developed by the OSD in 2008 required that the supporting and supported components complete a memorandum of agreement defining the installation support relationship between them for forming the joint base and to fully implement the BRAC 2005 joint basing decisions, and that the supporting component deliver installation support in accordance with the new definitions and standards.DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE DOD Needs to Periodically Review Support Standards and Costs at Joint Bases and Better Inform Congress of Facility Sustainment Funding Uses, GAO-09-336, March 2009 Resources then were transferred from the supported component(s) to the supporting component in the fiscal year 2010 President's Budget submittal to align resources with responsibility for installation support at the joint bases.Joint Returns, SIGNAL Magazine, May 2010 = Joint base common output level standards (JB- COLS) = The joint basing program represents Department of Defense (DoD) efforts to optimize the delivery of installation support across the services.

The framework of JB-COLS provides a common language to serve as a basis for (1) developing common output levels for each function of installation support at joint bases and (2) developing service-wide capability-based planning models for all installation support functions. OSD's 2008 guidance on implementing joint basing established a set of installation support functional areas and provided for the creation of a set of joint base common standards to define the level of service expected at each joint base and to ensure consistent delivery of installation support services. As of March 2014, there are 260 joint base common standards grouped into 48 functional areas and 12 categories.DOD JOINT BASES Management Improvements Needed to Achieve Greater Efficiencies, GAO-13-134, November 2012 = List of joint bases = Not all of the joint bases were mandated by BRAC 2005 law to establish themselves as joint bases; however, all 12 joint bases assumed that nomenclature or a variation. # Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling (US Navy–controlled) – consolidation of Naval Support Facility Anacostia and Bolling Air Force Base in the District of Columbia # Joint Base Andrews (US Air Force–controlled) – consolidation of Andrews Air Force Base and Naval Air Facility Washington in Maryland # Joint Base Charleston (US Air Force–controlled) – consolidation of Charleston Air Force Base and Naval Weapons Station Charleston in South Carolina # Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson (US Air Force–controlled) – consolidation of Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson in Alaska # Joint Base Langley–Eustis (US Air Force–controlled) – consolidation of Langley Air Force Base and Fort Eustis in Virginia # Joint Base Lewis–McChord (US Army–controlled) – consolidation of Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base in Washington # Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst (US Air Force–controlled) – consolidation of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst in New Jersey # Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall (US Army–controlled) – consolidation of Fort Myer and Henderson Hall (USMC) in Virginia # Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam (US Navy–controlled) – consolidation of Naval Station Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii # Joint Base San Antonio (US Air Force–controlled) – consolidation of Randolph Air Force Base, Lackland Air Force Base, Kelly Field Annex, and Fort Sam Houston in Texas # Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story (US Navy–controlled) – consolidation of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and Fort Story in Virginia # Joint Region Marianas (US Navy–controlled) – consolidation of Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam Joint Base Balad In addition to the above bases, Joint Base Balad was created as part of a combination of bases in Iraq.

Two authorities provided support to tenants: the base operations support integrator (BOS-I) and the senior airfield authority (SAA). The U.S. Air Force was the host at Joint Base Balad serving as both the BOS-I and SAA.

In the course of the cycle, the organist Paul Stetsenko performed the complete organ works of J. S. Bach. Content of the vesper services Each Vesper service opened with a major prelude, toccata, or fantasia. Traditionally, a strophic version of Phos Hilaron is sung, or a Vesper Proclamation. Scriptural texts were then chanted by the cantor or recited antiphonally by the congregation; these are selected according to the Liturgical Calendar. The congregation was also led in singing hymns (\\"chorales\\"); each chorale is then followed by an organ chorale prelude by Bach, written on that chorale. At the apex of the liturgy, a passage from the Gospel was chanted as trope, while the congregation stands. At the close of the liturgy, a large-scale fugue was played, while the lights are gradually dimmed. At the end, the sanctuary was dark, with only candles burning. Structure of the two-year cycle of Bach Vespers There were four segments in the cycle. Each segment focuses on a particular paradigm in historic worship. For instance, Segment I reflected the Orthodoxy and Classical Greek Christianity; Segment III centered on Lutheran theology and doctrines; Segments II and IV followed the Liturgical Year. I. A STORY OF GOD: Six days of Creation - six segments of the Liturgical Calendar The segment \\"A Story of God\\" told the story of six days of Creation through Bach's Six Trio-Sonatas for organ; it also narrated the story of Christ through Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes. II. LITURGICAL YEAR A: From Advent to Pentecost This segment of \\"Liturgical Year A\\" incorporated twelve organ Preludes and Fugues and Das Orgelbüchlein, the collection of chorales preludes outlining the Liturgical Year. III. THE LUTHERAN MASS This segment centered on the development of liturgical and theological thought that crystallized during the Protestant Reformation. Drawing from Bach’s collection of chorales from Clavier-Übung III, sometimes referred to as “The Lutheran Mass,” each Vesper service focused on a particular segment of the Protestant worship service, doctrine, article of faith. IV. LITURGICAL YEAR B: From Advent to Pentecost The last segment of the Liturgical Year incorporated remaining Preludes, Toccatas, Fantasias with corresponding Fugues, as well as miscellaneous organ pieces and chorale preludes by J. S. Bach, arranged to follow the cycles of The Liturgical Calendar, from Advent to Pentecost. Organ music as an Icon The organ composition of J. S. Bach were used in Bach Vespers in the same way icons are used in the worship of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Just as the icons reveal the invisible, so did organ compositions intend to connect the two worlds, the hidden and the revealed. This \\"orthopraxis\\" position rejects the status quo of music as a mere enhancement or edification to worship; instead, in Bach Vespers music was restored to its rightful place as \\"a window into heaven.\\" Category:Churches in Alexandria, Virginia Category:Presbyterian churches in Virginia ","title":"Bach Vespers at Westminster"},{"id":"30635199","text":"Los Rayos (The Rays) (2004) is the second album by Argentine singer-songwriter Vicentico from his solo career.

In its administrative and academic structure, VGU follows the German model and standards. VGU was founded officially in March 2008 under the form of a partnership between Vietnam and Germany. In September 2008, VGU had its first intake of students. The university currently offers Bachelor’s and Master's programs, covering the fields of engineering, natural sciences, and commerce.  History  The Vietnamese German University is founded on the cooperation between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the German Federal State of Hesse. The initial idea concerning the founding of a Vietnamese German University came up in 2006. The first agreements were arranged between the Vietnamese then-Minister for Education and Training (MOET), Prof. Dr. Nguyen Thien Nhan, and the Hessen State Minister for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK), Sir Udo Corts. In May 2007 they signed a Memorandum of Understanding in presence of the then German Federal President Horst Köhler and the President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Nguyễn Minh Triết. The foundation of VGU took place in March 2008. Its first president was Prof. Dr. Wolf Rieck, then President of the University of Applied Sciences, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Six months later, September 10, 2008, VGU was opened officially by the then Hessen State Premier, Roland Koch, the Vietnamese then-Minister of Education and Training cum Deputy Prime Minister, Prof. Dr. Nguyen Thien Nhan, and Prof. Dr. Wolf Rieck, President of VGU. Starting in September 2008, 35 students enrolled for VGU's first study program, “Electrical Engineering and Information Technology”, run by the University of Applied Sciences, Frankfurt am Main. Since 2009, VGU has offered four Master's programs, covering engineering areas as well as natural sciences. In the following academic year 2011, two additional Bachelor programs will be launched. A new Master's program will take place in close collaboration with VGU's newly founded “Vietnamese German Transport Research Centre” (VGTRC). VGU will widen its academic profile by implementing Finance and Economics in its study programs. VGU receives significant support from the VGU-Consortium, a non-profit organization which is considered as the academic backbone of VGU. More than 30 universities in Germany have joined the VGU- Consortium, including the TU9, an association of the leading German Universities of Technology. Officially founded in 2009, the VGU-Consortium supports VGU's academic and administrative issues. VGU's development is also progressed by the foundation of the University Council in February 2010. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Thien Nhan, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister cum former Minister of Education and Training (MOET), was nominated its chairman. Another important milestone for VGU's development is a World Bank loan of 180 million USD, which was confirmed in June 2010. The loan is mainly provided for the construction of a new campus in Bình Dương Province, adjacent to Ho Chi Minh City, which will be opened in 2016/17. Progress also happens in its academic development. VGU opened its first research centre, the “Vietnamese German Transport Research Centre”, in March 2010. It is part of a large, interdisciplinary research centre, the “Research Centre for High-Tech and Sustainability” which VGU is about to establish. Under its roof, VGU plans to establish five research centres: Traffic, Transport, Mobility and Logistics; Renewable Energy Technologies, Lightning Technologies; Sustainable Urban Development; “Green” Technologies and Resource Management; Biodiversity/Climate Change, Biotechnology. VGU's “Research Centre for High-Tech Engineering and Sustainability” is to be constructed on the new campus in Binh Duong Province, adjacent to Ho Chi Minh City. In March 2010, the first research centre, the “Vietnamese German Transport Research Centre” (VGTRC) was already founded. It is located in Thủ Đức District, about four km away from VGU's current campus. The foundation of the Vietnamese German University is a part of Vietnamese reform programs concerning the education sector (Higher Education Reform Agenda, HERA). Considering the further modernization of Vietnam, there is a growing need for a better higher education to push up the country's economic development. Therefore, Vietnamese higher education sector must be improved. The Vietnamese government has implemented a reform project, the “New Model University Project” (NMUP): four new universities are to be established within the next few years. Each of them is supported by a partner country and follows the university model of that country. VGU is a part of this program. Four universities will have strong influences on Vietnamese universities and meet Vietnam's education needs.  Model, Strategies and Organization  The foundation of VGU is a novelty: VGU is the first Vietnamese public university which is built up together with international partners and has an autonomous status. = Model and strategies = The Vietnamese German University follows the German university model. VGU's strategy is to import excellent German study programs and customize it to meet the needs of Vietnamese higher education. VGU aims to contribute to Vietnam's economic development.  Model  VGU follows the German model and standards in its academic and administrative structures. According to the German university model, research and teaching are combined. Also the university's autonomous status is part of Germany's higher education system: regarding VGU, the institutional and academic freedom is guaranteed in its foundation documents. Furthermore, VGU has a close cooperation with industry: companies in Vietnam as well as in Germany are VGU's cooperation partners. Hereby, technology transfer and innovation are supported.  Strategies  VGU's main concern is to contribute to Vietnam's economic modernization and development. Therefore, VGU offers a modern education with international standards: working in close collaboration with German partner universities, VGU offers German-accredited programs and is run by German partner universities. The curriculum are continuously adjusted to suit the needs of Vietnamese higher education. Students receive a German university degree after their study at VGU. The University aims to provide an excellent education which grants its students the best opportunities on the job market. The students, educated at VGU, are to push Vietnam's development. Furthermore, VGU aims to enhance and strengthen the research competencies of young Vietnamese academics. The strategy of “Capacity Building” is integrated into VGU's research activities within the next few years. Another strategy is to further educate VGU's academia and administrative employees. It is VGU's goal to ensure a “Gradual Handover”: most administrative and academic positions are to be handed over to Vietnamese employees, thus the number of German staff will be reduced. = Organization = In its academic and administrative structure, VGU follows the German university model. Its autonomous status is highly important. = Executive Board of the university = The University Council is the most important body in VGU's organizational structure. It consists of twenty members. Its members are nominated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) as well as by the State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK): each Ministry nominates ten members of the University Council. Its Chairman is Prof. Dr. Nguyen Thien Nhan, Vietnamese former-Minister for Education and Training (MOET). VGU's Presidential Board consists of one President and four Vice Presidents which are to be nominated soon. Since March 2008, Prof. Dr. Wolf Rieck has acted as the President of VGU. Vietnamese side and German side are in charge of the nomination of 2 Vice Presidents each. The Academic Senate and an Advisory Board, consisting of twelve members, complete VGU's organizational structure.Feasibility Study. Report for the construction and development of the Vietnamese-German University, p. 64-70.  Academic structures  VGU's academic structures are being developed and progressing within the next few years according to VGU's general development. Interdisciplinary research centres and graduate schools will be established. = Stakeholders = The Vietnamese German University is based on the cooperation between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Federal Republic of Germany, especially the State of Hesse. Both countries aim to build an acknowledged research university in Vietnam. VGU is substantially supported by German as well as Vietnamese institutions. Being a Vietnamese State University, Vietnam is in charge of covering the running costs. German institutions such as the State of Hesse, the German Federal government and the State of Baden-Württemberg support VGU financially. The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the World University Services (WUS, Germany) contribute to VGU's further development by their long-term experience in higher education. Furthermore, German and multi-national companies support VGU. The VGU-Consortium, a non-profit organization plays a significant role for VGU's progress. It consists of more than 30 universities which include the TU9, an association Germany's leading Universities of Technology. The VGU- Consortium coordinates the cooperation with German partner universities and is in charge of academic as well as administrative issues. The VGU-Consortium also seeks to contribute to the internationalization of the German higher education sector. An important milestone in VGU's development is the loan of US$180 million, provided by the World Bank. Approved in June 2010, the loan is mainly used for the construction of the new campus in Binh Duong Province, a blooming town adjacent to Ho Chi Minh City.  Studies  The Vietnamese German University follows the model of German universities of technology. In its teaching and research it focuses on engineering and natural sciences. In 2011, there will be programs of study for Business, Finance and Economics as well. = German programs of study = During the transitional phase, VGU imports German programs of study to Vietnam which are run by German partner universities. Bachelor and Master's programs are offered. Within the next few years, VGU will also offer PhD programs. In this transitional phase, students receive a German university degree provided by the German partner university which is in charge of the program. The university degrees follow the criteria defined by the Bologna Process. After having established the necessary academic structures, VGU will offer programs of study which are independent from German partner universities. They will be offered by VGU itself. Also the university degrees will be provided by VGU as an acknowledged, autonomous and independent university. To grant the quality of VGU's programs of study, different measures for quality assurance have been installed, e.g., the programs of study must be accredited in Germany. Furthermore, the teaching staff as well as the programs are evaluated and continuous further training will be delivered to the teaching staff. VGU's programs of study are focused on real-world experiences and industry to improve the student's opportunities on the job market. VGU's profile is furthermore determined by its close cooperation with industry in Germany and Vietnam: research and teaching are to be strengthened by this close cooperation, well-educated future employees are to be trained and technology transfer is to be ensured. The close link to Germany is enforced by exchange semesters to German universities which are offered in some of the programs of study. VGU, considering itself as a gateway to Germany, also offers the possibility of undertaking an internship in German companies. = Teaching = German professors, lecturing at VGU's German partner universities, are in charge of teaching at VGU. Staying in Ho Chi Minh City for a couple of weeks, they offer single modules in blocked seminars, supported by Vietnamese lecturers. German program coordinators, teaching at VGU's German partner universities and staying in Vietnam for a longer period of time, organize and run the programs of study, customize them to needs of Vietnamese higher education. The medium of instruction at VGU is English. Students are provided with English language courses, run by native teachers. Bachelor’s students are to participate in a mandatory “Foundation Year” before the chosen program of study starts: mainly English skills as well as specific basic knowledge such as methodology, needed for the programs of study, are taught. Furthermore, VGU offers German language courses, teaching German and providing students with information about German politics, economy and culture.  Undergraduate programs  Since September 2008, VGU has offered the Bachelor’s program in “Electrical Engineering and Information Technology”. In 2011, “Finance Management” and “Business Information” are offered. The curriculum are run with a close cooperation with German partner universities, e.g. the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt am Main, Germany is responsible for the Bachelor’s program in “Electrical Engineering and Information Technology”. VGU's Bachelor students are to participate in a mandatory “Foundation Year”: it is designed to bridge the gap between Vietnamese and German secondary education. The program focuses mainly on improving the student’s English skills, given the fact that the language of instruction at VGU is English. Furthermore, specific basic knowledge such as research methodology that are crucial to the programs study at VGU, is also taught.  Post-graduate programs  VGU currently offers six Masters programs: “Business Information Systems” in cooperation with the Hochschule Furtwagen University and Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences. “Computational Engineering” in cooperation with Ruhr University Bochum “Mechatronics and Sensor Systems Technology” is run by the University of Applied Sciences, Karlsruhe “Sustainable Urban Development” by the Technical University of Darmstadt (TUD) \\"Global Production Engineering and Management\\" in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, Germany \\"MBA in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises Development\\" in cooperation with the University of Leipzig, Germany  Tuition Fees and Scholarships  The tuition fees become due at the beginning of each semester. Due to generous support by Vietnamese and German institutions, the tuition fees at VGU are quite moderate. Furthermore, VGU offers various scholarships to 60% of the students. The scholarships are valued at 25% to 100% of VGU's tuition fees.  Research  It is VGU's goal to become a leading research university in Vietnam and the region within the next few years. Therefore, interdisciplinary research schools and centers, following the German model, are to be established. VGU plans to build up a “Research Centre for High-Tech Engineering and Sustainability”. It is to be structured as a foundation for single research centers. Five main areas of research have been identified: Energy and Lightning Technology, Traffic, Transport and Logistics, Water Technologies and Water Resource Management, Sustainable Urban Development, and Green Technologies and Resource Management. In March 2010, VGU's first research centre, the “Vietnamese German Transport Research Centre” (VGTRC), was founded.  Campus  VGU campus is located at Binh Duong New City, Vietnam. Also a bigger, more modern and more equipped new campus is getting build. The World Bank loan which was approved in June 2010, is mainly for the construction of this new campus. The campus will be located in Binh Duong Province, 45 km away from HCMC. Next to its teaching buildings, the plans also include VGU's research centers and dormitories. The construction of the new campus is to follow the latest technologies: renewable energies, ecological construction methods, etc.  References   External links  http://www.hessen.de/irj/HMWK_Internet?cid=fe4a30288f1e35a9cde455e08a551d5d Category:Universities in Ho Chi Minh City Category:Educational institutions established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in Vietnam ","title":"Vietnamese-German University"},{"id":"30635233","text":"A roshandan (Hindi/Urdu: रोशनदान or روشندان) is a feature of many dwelling structures in North India and Pakistan that is a combined skylight and ventilating window.

Built to provide irrigation water storage, flood control, and hydropower generation, it is the largest dam along the international boundary reach of the Rio Grande. The dam is over long, lies mostly on the Mexican side of the border, and forms Amistad Reservoir. It supplies water for irrigation in the Rio Grande Valley, upstream of the Rio Grande's mouth on the Gulf of Mexico at Brownsville, Texas/Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The dam is owned and operated by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), and also facilitates the Amistad Dam Port of Entry. Amistad is derived from the Spanish word for \\"friendship\\", representing the two nations' cooperation on the dam. History Because of the Rio Grande's frequent floods and droughts, the sharing of its water between the US and Mexico has been a contentious issue since the 1800s. The 1906 Treaty for Equitable Distribution of the Waters of the Rio Grande enabled the construction of Elephant Butte Dam, the first major Rio Grande dam, in New Mexico. While this benefited water users along the middle Rio Grande, it did little to help the lower Rio Grande Valley, where water flows remained uncontrolled. The 1944 Treaty relating to the utilization of waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande authorized the IBWC to build dams on the uncontrolled border segment of the Rio Grande. The first dam to be completed under the treaty was Falcon Dam in 1953.https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/tx/tx1100/tx1177/data/tx1177data.pdf After the Rio Grande flooded massively in 1954, with a peak flow of recorded at Del Rio, planners realized that a much larger dam would be needed to control the river and two unregulated tributaries, the Pecos and Devils Rivers. The proposed site for the larger dam was about a mile (1.6 km) below the confluence of the Devils River and upstream of Del Rio. During the initial planning stage, it was known as \\"Diablo Reservoir\\", a nod to the name of Devils River (diablo meaning \\"devil\\" in Spanish). The final design was approved by the two governments as Minute 207, and authorized by an act of U.S. Congress on July 7, 1960. Work at the dam site began in August 1963 with foundation drilling and grouting in the river bed to support the future concrete section of the dam. Actual construction of the dam itself began in January 1965 and water was first impounded in 1968. U.S. president Richard Nixon and Mexican president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz dedicated the dam in 1969. The construction of the dam required the relocation of of the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks, of highways, and two bridges. When the reservoir filled, it inundated ancient rock art left by Native Americans who once lived in the areas. More than 170 archaeological sites were cataloged during salvage operations between 1958 and 1969, a difficult undertaking due to the arid and remote conditions of the area. The hydroelectric power plants were added later, with the US plant completed in 1983 and the Mexican plant in 1987. Of the dam's roughly US$125 million cost, the US paid about 57% and Mexico 43%, in accordance with the division of water storage rights in the reservoir. In 1993, the dam was determined to be silting up at the rate of per year, about 31% greater than had been expected at the time of construction. Specifications =Dam and spillways= The dam has a total length of , almost 6 miles (10 km), of which are in Mexico and in the United States. The center section at the Rio Grande is a concrete gravity dam long, with the remainder being earthen embankment. In total, the dam contains 13.5 million cubic yards (10,300,000 m3) of earth, 1.8 million cubic yards (1,400,000 m3) of concrete, 1.76 million cubic yards (1,300,000 m3) of riprap, and 12,500 tons (11,300 metric tons) of steel. The maximum height above the riverbed is , and the elevation at the dam crest is above sea level. The roadway along the dam crest is wide. The embankments are protected on both sides by riprap to reduce erosion. The riprap is thick on the upstream (reservoir) side and thick on the downstream side. Because the dam is founded on karstic limestone of the Georgetown formation, a very deep grout curtain was extended underground to block seepage and the risk of dam failure by internal erosion. Despite this, more than 30 sinkholes have been discovered near the upstream side of the dam and seepage rates have been recorded at over , which may be much higher due to unmeasured seepage on the Mexican side of the dam. However, because the water is traveling through bedrock and not the dam itself, this poses little threat to the dam's structural stability.http://ussdams.com/proceedings/2011Proc/527-544.pdf During extreme flood events, however, this may still be a cause for concern. Flood waters are released through a concrete ogee crest spillway with 16 tainter gates. The gates measure and can spill up to . The spillway empties into a stilling basin long, designed to dissipate erosion. =Water supply and flood control= The Amistad reservoir covers at normal (conservation) water levels of above sea level. It is one of the largest lakes in the Rio Grande system by both surface area and volume. Of the reservoir's capacity, 61% is dedicated to water conservation and sediment control, 32% to flood control, and 7% to surcharge (flood storage above the top of the spillway gates, but below the crest of the dam). At the top of the flood control pool, the reservoir is and at the top of the surcharge pool it is . The lowest lake elevation at which water can be released is , or below normal levels. At the top of the conservation pool, the reservoir extends up the Rio Grande, up the Devils River, and up the Pecos River. It has a shoreline of , of which are in the US and are in Mexico. Southern Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 90 bridges on Amistad Reservoir About 56.2% of the water released from Amistad Dam is allocated to the United States, and 43.8% to Mexico. The IBWC determines the fraction of water stored in Amistad Reservoir belonging to either country on a biweekly basis, based on this allocation. The reservoir levels fluctuate greatly due to the region's highly variable annual precipitation as well as heavy water use. The record high level was on September 22, 1974.https://www.nps.gov/amis/planyourvisit/upload/Feb-2014-Amistad-Lake- Graph.pdf It reached a record low level of on May 23, 2013, or below normal levels, after several consecutive years of drought. The average annual inflow to Amistad Reservoir is about .http://riogrande.tamu.edu/media/3901/miyamoto-8-amistad-pub.pdf Although the majority – about 70% – of the inflows to Amistad Reservoir comes from the Rio Grande, Devils, and Pecos Rivers, about 30% is from local springs. Inflows typically peak between August and October due to monsoon storms and hurricanes that strike the Gulf Coast. Flood flows caused by hurricanes are short-lived, but can be extreme, with a maximum (since dam construction) of more than in late September, 1974. Dam operators held the outflow from Amistad Dam at about , sparing a large part of the Rio Grande Valley from flooding. Because of diversions of the Rio Grande in the upriver U.S. states of Colorado and New Mexico, the Rio Conchos (which originates in Chihuahua, Mexico) actually provides the majority of the water flowing from the Rio Grande into the lake. Increasing water use in upriver communities has caused a steady decline in Rio Grande flows throughout the 20th and 21st centuries and has led to concerns about future water levels and supplies at Amistad.https://www.nature.nps.gov/water/planning/management_plans/amis_wrsr_screen.pdfhttp://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context;=jcwre =Power generation= The dam has two hydroelectric power stations, one on either side of the border, with a capacity of 66 megawatts (MW) each.

The maximum combined water flow through the power plants is . In 2009, the Amistad Dam plants produced a total of 296,734,000 kilowatt hours. Border crossing The Amistad Dam Port of Entry was built when Amistad Dam was completed in 1969. The Dam was a bi-national effort to establish flood control on the Rio Grande and provide sources of water. Although US Department of Transportation statistics combine traffic counts with Del Rio Texas Port of Entry, approximately 65,000 vehicles crossed the dam into the US in 2005. The border station was rebuilt by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 2012. Recreation The dam and reservoir are part of the Amistad National Recreation Area.

The first European to visit the area was government surveyor John Forrest who passed through in 1869 while on an expedition in search of the lost explorer Ludwig Leichhardt. On 25 June he named a nearby hill Mount Margaret after Margaret Elvire Hamersley whom he later married in 1876. The local indigenous name for the hill is Kalgara. Gold was discovered at the site of the future town in 1893 by prospectors James Ross and Bob McKenzie. The town's main mine was the Mt Morven (formerly the Mt Margaret Reward), situated on the eastern side of the townsite. By 1896 the local progress association began campaigning for the townsite to be declared. By 1897 lots had been surveyed and the townsite was gazetted in the same year. A police station opened in the town in 1898 but was closed in 1899. Following a drought in the area in 1921 Rod Schenk established the Mount Margaret Aboriginal Mission in 1922, to the northeast of the townsite. In 1924 many Aboriginal people were forced to go to nearby Mount Morgans for food following another drought and hostility towards them by local station owners. When the Mount Morgans and Linden food depots were closed in 1927, the Aboriginal peoples moved to the mission at Mount Margaret.

Early years Gertrude van den Bergh was baptized in Cologne, the eldest daughter of Dutch father Henderik van den Bergh and German Maria Theresia Leydel. Van den Bergh showed talent for music at an early age, took piano lessons at six and published a harpsichord sonata at the age of nine. She studied composition with Johann Burgmüller and piano with Ferdinand Ries. Career In 1809 van den Bergh's father organized a concert tour of the Netherlands for Gertrude and her sister Sophia. The family moved to The Hague about 1813, and afterward Van den Bergh seldom played in public. She continued to perform in private circles and remained well known. In 1830 she was invited to join the Society for the Promotion of Music, which had not been previously open to women. In 1834 the society held a two-day festival in The Hague where Van den Bergh participated. She directed the first mixed voice choir from The Hague and from 1837 or 1838 the Vocal Society.

They dream of something different, another life with a future. On the peeling walls of their tenement, Rosie prominently places a painting she owns that gives them both hope and something tangible to cling to. It's an exotic beach view of another more peaceful world, but they exist miles and worlds a part. So with his friend and cohort Malt, Rocksy eyes a fancy sports car nearby and together they devise a plot to steal it to sell for parts. The car belongs to a local Lebanese businessman, Faris and they figure the money could change their lives immediately, but of course it’s only temporarily. Their plot is also risky and not well thought out. Rosie is dead set against it and fed up. She dreams for the beach view, she wants out, out of being entangled and out of the life.

FEDERAL, PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS OPEN NEWLY TWINNED SECTION OF HIGHWAY 101. Transport Canada. It is usually done when an existing highway requires a significant increase in capacity. Twinning is frequently advantageous because it allows traffic capacity to be doubled and produces a dual carriageway with separation between traffic directions, while keeping the existing right of way. Additionally, unlike simple widening, the old road stays open while the twin is being built. Some freeways are constructed by bypassing an established two- or four-lane highway. The older highways, constructed before the demand to travel that route existed, or before the legislation of control of access, are often lined with residences and businesses. Without control of access, a municipal or state government is obliged to provide a driveway access where the owner sees fit. The bypass may be initially designed as a freeway, but often the need for such a route is not immediately present. Instead, a two lane road with no properties abutting it is constructed. A wide right-of-way is purchased in most cases so that enough property is available to simply twin the highway. These roads are known as a Super Two, and can be easily upgraded to a freeway by constructing interchanges and by twinning the road.

McMahon (1875–1958) was an American architect who even today remains highly regarded for his churches, schools and other buildings for Catholic clients in Connecticut, especially Hartford and New Haven.  Early life and architectural training  McMahon was born in 1875 in Hartford, Connecticut, where he would live for the rest of his life. He studied as a boy at St. Patrick School where one of his classmates, John F. Callahan, would later become a Catholic priest and one of McMahon's clients. He left school a few months before graduation in 1890 and took a job as an errand boy. Three years later he was hired by the architectural firm of Frederick R. Comstock as an apprentice. He worked both in Hartford and New York City. His most notable project was the 1899 Second Church of Christ Scientist, located at 68th Street and Central Park West, New York City. His architectural training was cut short when he enlisted in the Connecticut National Guard to take part in the Spanish–American War. Eventually McMahon attained the rank of colonel and was henceforth known, professionally and otherwise, as \\"the Colonel\\".  Architectural practice  In 1900 McMahon became associate architect of the Hartford, CT firm J. J. Dwyer & J. J. McMahon, with John J. Dwyer. He remained in this position until 1911 when he entered into a long partnership with Frank Warren Whiton, forming the firm of Whiton and McMahon. They continued together until 1932 when the practice was dissolved due to the economic depression. After that McMahon practiced under his own name and briefly with architect Russell Hills.

It is a fantasy novel that chronicles the adventures of an American teenage boy after he stumbles through a magical doorway in his grandfather's basement, and into a war-torn fantasy world called Pangrelor. The main story arc involves the protagonist's gradual discovery of his unknown relation to Pangrelor, and his unlikely quest to help save its greatest civilization, which is centered on the mountaintop city of Harwelden. Several times during the story, the protagonist is told that success in saving this fabled city of Harwelden may help to save his own dying mother, who remains isolated from him and terminally ill in New Orleans. Antiquitas Lost has many high quality illustrations, which is unusual for this genre. Synopsis Antiquitas Lost tells the story of a boy named Elliott, a lonesome kid with deformities on his hands and feet, who is uprooted from his home after his mother falls gravely ill. When they move to New Orleans so his grandfather can help care for her, Elliott learns that the old man's eighteenth century mansion hides an ancient secret. While checking out some eerie paintings and strange relics in the basement, Elliott strays through an ancient doorway into a tumultuous parallel world, full of bizarre creatures and warring races. He has stumbled into Pangrelor, the most ancient of all worlds and “mother to all the stars in the sky.” As he learns to navigate his new surroundings, he discovers wondrous abilities he never dreamed he possessed, and an abiding connection to the primitive, alien world that will forever change him. But he must proceed carefully. For he soon learns that his actions in the ancient world will impact the upcoming battle for Harwelden, Pangrelor's greatest civilization, and will also resonate all the way back to New Orleans, perhaps deciding whether his own mother lives or dies.

Foreword Reviews also praised Antiquitas Lost, stating: “This debut novel is a far-flung quest through a world of nightmarish creatures and epic conflicts in the spirit of Tolkien's The Hobbit, but what makes the story truly wondrous are the many personal touches that the author provides in creating his multi- faceted characters.\\" The Seattle Post Intelligencer review stated: “Robert Louis Smith has channeled Anne Rice's unassuming writing style and pacing while borrowing themes from an earlier period of fantasy writing... Antiquitas Lost is a nostalgic trip to another world. It borrows much from an earlier period of books, comics, and movies and comes off as an original homage to everything loved about youth with enough that is new to avoid parody.” ComicAttack.net criticized the novel for using familiar fantasy plot mechanisms, and suggested simplistic thematic depth, yet offered an overall positive review, stating: \\"[Antiquitas Lost has] a fresh, easy feel with lots of clear, well versed action. Smith’s greatest asset is his ability to write with great pacing. For a 615 page epic fantasy, this has an enjoyable pace that’s not too fast and not too slow... [It] brought out the childhood me who enjoyed reading old novels with illustrations such as Treasure Island.\\" ScienceFiction.com also reviewed Antiquitas Lost favorably, stating: \\"...The creatures that Smith created resemble popular creatures from other novels, with the exception of the Salax. The Salax are horrifying and unique...[Antiquitas Lost] was compelling and energetic. You can tell Isherwood enjoyed illustrating it as well, with his detail and his character depictions.\\" However, the ScienceFiction.com review criticized the protagonist as being too one dimensional, and described some of the early character development as \\"tedious\\".

Major characters Listed are the major characters in the book. *Elliott: age 15, lonesome and unlucky boy from New Orleans with deformities on his hands and feet. At the beginning of the story, he stumbles through a magical doorway into an ancient, parallel world (Pangrelor), where he discovers that his deformities hide strange abilities he never dreamed he possessed. As he learns to navigate his new surroundings, he also discovers an abiding connection to the alien world into which he has passed. Elliott is the story's protagonist. *Sarintha: age 16–18, Princess of Harwelden (Pangrelor's greatest civilization). Just before the story begins, Sarintha suffers the death of her father, King Gregorus. At the beginning of the story, she is captured by the enemy serpan horde and carried away to their homeland. As the story progresses, she begins to fear that she is the intended target of a coup, and that the forces at Harwelden do not intend for her to be crowned as Queen. * Hooks: middle-aged beast from the Valley of Susquatania. Hooks is a petty criminal and an outcast from his homeland. Early in the story, he is captured during the commission of a theft and sentenced to die in Harwelden's central square. But he has a few tricks up his sleeve, and an incredible secret no one could ever guess. * Marvus: elderly gimlet with some fight left in him, and chief steward of the captured Princess. * Jingo: the youngest gimlet ever advanced to the position of royal steward. He is Marvus's protege and also serves Princess Sarintha. He is skilled with throwing a dagger and widely known for his faith in The Shama, a local religion. * Crosslyn: an elderly, though powerful, Shamalan priest. He was a member of the royal Shamalan court in the old times, and was thought to be long dead. Elliott and others find him hiding in the wilderness, waiting for the winds of war to turn back in favor of Harwelden. * Woolf: a middle- aged grayfarer, and sitting member of Harwelden's Grayfarer Council. He is a fierce and loyal warrior, who is sent on a quest to hunt down Elliott lest he interfere with the empires plans for war with the serpans. * Slipher: a young serpan warrior who defects from his regiment. Facing certain death if captured by his own countrymen, he aims to redeem himself by assassinating Elliott, who has piqued the interest of the serpan emperor. *Malus Lothar: the mysterious Serpan emperor, whose face remains covered at all times by an ornate steel mask. He is a believer in the old magic, and fears that Elliott's unexpected arrival in Pangrelor may adversely affect his plans to storm Harwelden and eradicate the Shamalans once and for all. * Grimaldi: an older grayfarer, and general in Harwelden's grayfarer army. Like Woolf, he is a fearsome warrior, though he has been captured by the serpans before the story begins. When Princess Sarintha is imprisoned by the serpans, she finds her old friend Grimaldi faces a grisly fate. *Waldemariam: a middle-aged grayfarer warrior, and Chancellor of Harwelden's powerful Grayfarer Council. As the story progresses, his loyalties become unclear, though he holds so much power, no one is quite sure what to do about it. Races Listed are the major types of creatures in the book. *Shamalans: For thousands of years, Shamalans have been the ruling class on Pangrelor. They are Atlantean in concept and have the ability to transform themselves into an aquatic form. Once in the aquatic form, they can breathe underwater and swim “like creatures born of the sea”. Underwater, specialized membranes cover their eyes and allow them to see clearly. However, when they are in their “land form”, they are indistinguishable from humans, except for “birthmarks” that cover the webbed spaces between their hands and feet. There are four distinct classes of Shamalans. These include the nobles, the priests, the warriors, and the artisans. Major Shamalan characters in Antiquitas Lost include Princess Sarintha (noble) and Crosslyn (priest). *Grayfarers: Grayfarers are a class of winged warriors that are approximately eight feet tall and canine in appearance. They are known for their predilection for battle and for their lack of faith in The Shama (a local religion). They have talons on their hands and feet and their primary means of locomotion is flight, though they have no trouble walking. They have been allied with the Shamalans for perhaps a thousand years and serve as the protectors of Harwelden (Pangrelor's ruling civilization). The powerful Grayfarer Council of Harwelden is a political body second in power only to the royalty. Major Grayfarer characters in Antiquitas Lost (there are many) include Waldemariam, Woolf, Grimaldi, and Oscar. * Serpans: The Serpans are a race of massive, primitive hominids that live on Pangrelor's icy northern continent (Vengala). Serpan culture is remorselessly violent. Like the Shamalans, the Serpans are an ancient race, but their geographic origins have left them at a strong disadvantage for natural resources. Conversely, The Shamalans inhabit the lush southeastern coast of Pangrelor's bountiful Carafayan continent, and this disparity of natural resources has been a driving force in the generations-long war between the Shamalan empire and the Serpan hordes. Major Serpan characters in Antiquitas Lost include Slipher and Golthel. * Gimlets: Gimlets are a race of diminutive, primitive hominids with keen intelligence. They are known for their short stature, potbellies, and protuberant ears. Gimlet cities have thrived throughout all of Pangrelor, and gimlets seem to be ubiquitous there. Over the last few generations, the Carafayan gimlets (those living on the same continent as the Shamalans) have had to adapt to the realities of war as attacks from the northerly serpan horde have increased in frequency and lethality. As a result, several gimlet cities have formed their own armies. For the friendly gimlet race, such a thing would have been unheard of just a few generations previously. Major gimlet characters in Antiquitas Lost include Marvus and Jingo. * Susquatanians: Susquatanians are a race of furry, bipedal, forest-dwelling beasts that occupy the wooded Valley of Susquatania (aka the “Valley of the Beasts”) and the neighboring Susquatanian Forest. Their ancient wooded homeland lies between the mountain city of Harwelden, where the Shamalans live, and the Serpans spindly mountaintop castle (known as Sitticus). Because of their geographic location, the Susquatanians increasingly find themselves caught in the middle of the escalating war between the Shamalans and the Serpans. However, they are determined to remain neutral at all costs, and spare themselves from the agonies of the worsening conflict. Major Susquatanian characters in Antiquitas Lost include Hooks and Keats. * Darfoyles: Darfoyles share remote biological origins with the Grayfarers, and the two races are described as “ancient cousins”, though the darfoyles are larger, darker in color, and have tails. Like the Grayfarers, the Darfoyles have talons on their hands and feet and flight is their primary method of locomotion. The Darfoyles tend to inhabit Pangrelor's northern climes and they are closely allied with the serpans (much like the Grayfarers to the Shamalans). There appear to be fewer Darfoyles in Pangrelor than Grayfarers, though some of the Darfoyles serving the serpan emperor have become quite well known. Major Darfoyle characters in Antiquitas Lost include Viscount Ecsar and Viscount Erebus. Pangrelor Pangrelor, the fantasy world depicted in Antiquitas Lost, is envisioned as a habitable mega-planet, or \\"Super-Earth\\" orbiting a binary star system. The size of the world is referred to obliquely (ten times larger than earth), and the planet is frequently described as having two suns. Gravitational forces are not explained, though the characters seem to experience gravity and temperatures similar to those of Earth. *Flora and Fauna: Flora and fauna seem quite similar to Earth's Pleistocene era. For example, two species of giant, wingless birds (Magby's and Opilions) are mentioned in the books early chapters. These are similar to the Moa, large wingless birds that were common in the Pleistocene and persisted until about 1400 AD, when they are believed to have gone extinct. There are also references to tiny elephants, sloths (called larilars in the novel) wooly mammoths, giant beavers, dire wolves, cave bears, and great sabre-toothed cats (simitars), all of which were common in the Pleistocene.Ice Age Animals. Museum.state.il.us. Retrieved on November 10, 2011. There is at least one Pangrelorian species of dinosaur referenced in the book (malevosaurs). In addition to these creatures, several recognizable cryptozoological creatures inhabit Pangrelor as well, including the Susquatanian beasts (similar to our own Sasquatch) and the Grayfarers (similar to Gargoyles). There are at least two types of creatures in Pangrelor, the Salax and the Satyral, that seem to have no connection to any types of creatures we are familiar with on Earth, though the Satyral is a chimera, making him reminiscent of creatures seen in ancient Greek mythology. Most of the action in the story takes place on the continent of Lon Carafay (aka the Carafayan continent). Three large Carafayan forests are described (with giant trees that have trunks \\"wider than a fair sized house\\"). *Technology: Pangrelor is a pre-industrial medieval world, with technology having reached anywhere from stone-age capabilities to iron-age capabilities, depending on which Pangrelorian culture is depicted. There is no electricity and communications must travel by word-of-mouth, though magic is possible. Transportation across long distances is primarily achieved by riding horses, malevosaurs, or mammoths (unless one is a Grayfarer or Darfoyle, in which case flight is possible). The story's antagonist, Malus Lothar, often travels by \\"sky chariot\\", which is a contraption that consists of a riders coach hanging beneath the hawsers of four, soaring, fire breathing lizards. *Culture: In regard to Pangrelor's cultural development, the artistic works that fill the mountaintop city of Harwelden are described as masterful, and likened by the protagonist to creations from Earth's European Renaissance period, such as the works of Michelangelo or Da Vinci.The complete works. Leonardo Da Vinci. Retrieved on November 10, 2011. There are several references to majestic paintings, statues, murals and tapestries in Harwelden, as well as some in the gimlet city of Scopulus. In one scene, a ceremony is accompanied by a fine orchestra and choir. These advanced cultural developments stand in sharp contrast to the savage, untamed natural environment. *Transport:The protagonist, Elliott, is magically transported to Pangrelor after discovering an ancient doorway in the basement of his grandfather's eighteenth century New Orleans mansion. Toward the end of the story, it is implied that Pangrelor is a real place, existing somewhere among the stars. There seems to be an implication that the magical doorway through which Elliott was transported might be some type of wormhole. In the final scenes, Pangrelor is referred to as \\"the mother to all the stars in the sky\\", and \\"the first world\\". It is also stated that events on Pangrelor will have far reaching consequences that will affect happenings on other worlds, such as Earth. *Unique Qualities: The fantasy world of Pangrelor is different from many literary fantasy worlds, such as Tolkien's middle earth and the many derivative worlds that have followed, in that it is devoid of elves, dwarves, magic rings, and magic swords. Rather, the author has peopled Pangrelor with magical creatures that most readers will be familiar with, but ones quite different from the usual fantasy novel inhabitants. Themes There are a few dominant themes in the Antiquitas Lost *Clash of Cultures: Through the character Slipher, the novel explores what drives one culture (the serpans) to hate another (the shamalans). This topic is explored primarily through interactions between Slipher and Elliott, the books protagonist, as well as through Slipher's personal experiences and inner dialogue. Questions considered involve the role of poverty, squalor, and envy in motivating one to hate another. What is the culpability of the wealthier civilization? *Religion and faith as a political tool: The novels antagonist, Malus Lothar, consciously uses the serpans religious faith to motivate them to kill their enemies (the shamalans). Despite this, it is not clear that he himself shares this religious zeal. It is also implied that the Shamalan leaders are adept at using religious faith to motivate their own armies, though this is not depicted outright in the plot. *Redemption: Through the character Hooks, we see that it is possible for one to find redemption through noble deeds, even after a life of crime that has spanned many years. The character Slipher is also offered a chance at redemption after deserting his serpan regiment and being targeted for execution, though his fate is somewhat different from Hooks, presumably due to his inability or lack of will to redeem himself when offered the opportunity. *Distrust of power: Throughout the bulk of the novel, the acting ruler of Harwelden is the Grayfarer Waldemariam, who sits at the head of the powerful Grayfarer Council of Harwelden. Early in the story, the reader is led to question his motives, and Waldemariam repeatedly and knowingly lies to Harwelden's citizenry about the threat they are facing from the encroaching serpans. Several members of his own council grow wary of him, even to the point of suspecting treason, but the citizens of Harwelden, believing his every word, fail to show any concern at all as the serpan army grows nearer. In many scenes, we see the citizens of Harwelden rejoicing, holding parades as they prepare for an upcoming seasonal festival, even as the enemy army is surrounding their mountaintop home. *Can there be goodness in evil?: Though the serpan culture is depicted as remorselessly violent, we learn that Slipher's mother is gentle, and has gone to great sacrifice for Slipher and his deformed younger brother. We also see Slipher's gentleness toward and love of his pet donkey, Pongo.

Westminster Presbyterian Church is a member of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Mid-Atlantic Synod and the National Capital Presbytery. History The congregation was founded in 1932. Its initial colonial-style edifice was built in 1942. The current sanctuary was constructed in 1952 to accommodate the rapidly growing congregation; the old sanctuary became the chapel. The cornerstone of the new building was laid by then President Harry S. Truman. In 1961, a large education building was added to accommodate Sunday school classes, music facilities, additional office spaces, and meeting areas for numerous church programs. The church's current organ is a three-manual M. P. Moller, installed by the firm in 1965; the dedicatory recital was played by Virgil Fox, the prominent American concert organist. In 2006–07, the church underwent major renovations, during which the sanctuary was again rebuilt to accommodate the changing liturgical needs. During the renovations on the church, Agudas Achim Congregation served as the temporary home of the church. Senior Pastors at Westminster Presbyterian Church * The Rev.

Haverkamp Worship The order of service follows the structure of The Service for the Lord's Day as outlined in The Book of Common Worship of 1993, a directory of worship that has restored a liturgical tradition that is both Reformed and catholic (pre-denominational). While the centrality of Scripture is upheld through the Word read and proclaimed, the church recognizes that the true unity begins with the sacraments of Baptism and Communion. The Eucharist is recognized as central to the liturgy, which at Westminster Presbyterian Church is exemplified by the central position of the communion table. The unity of the communion table, the baptismal font, and the pulpit signify \\"the true road to healing the brokenness of Christ's church.\\" The Book of Common Worship of 1993; Westminster John Knox Press, Louisville-London, p. 7 Music ministry The music ministry at Westminster Presbyterian Church is firmly based in the traditions of classical music. Its music ministry offers the members opportunities to lead worship services as choristers, handbell players, vocal and instrumental soloists, and cantors. The choir sings a great variety of music in worship, from Renaissance Motets to complex and difficult works such as Bach's St John Passion, Magnificat, several church Cantatas, Rachmaninoff's Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, Ralph Vaughan Williams' \\"Dona nobis pacem,\\" or Sergei Taneyev's \\"St. John of Damascus.\\" Choral emphasis is on a cappella music. In 2009-2011, Westminster also offered Bach Vespers at Westminster, a series of evening worship services, unique not only in Alexandria, VA but also in the entire region. In the two-year cycle of these vesper services, former Westminster Director of Music Ministies Paul Stetsenko performed the complete organ works of J. S. Bach.

It was directed by debutant director Arun Roy. The film is based on the historical events leading to a football match between Mohun Bagan and East Yorkshire Regiment on 29 July 1911, a time when India was under the British rule. This was the first time when Mohun Bagan, or any native team won the IFA Shield. The film commemorated that event in its centenary year 2011. Plot Egaro is also the first celluloid tribute to the eleven Mohun Bagan players who won the shield, ten of them playing barefoot clad in folded dhotis with just one of them, Sudhir Chatterjee, wearing boots against a team with the right kit, boots, dress, infrastructural support and the typical bias of the White rulers against the coloured Ruled. But Egaro is not just about football. It is about the patriotic passion that drove these eleven players to unite thousands of Indians from the entire eastern regions who flocked in from Dhaka, Burdwan, Midnapore crossing barriers of caste, class, community and language to watch the players kick and beat up the British teams on the playing field without being punished by the rulers because it was all in the game. It is about the killer spirit where the killer took prominence not because it was a fight to finish, but because the final match was a battlefield where the winning could speed the movement against Imperial rule and towards freedom. It did, in a manner of speaking. After the historic win on 29 July 1911, the British felt pressured enough to shift its capital from Calcutta to Delhi on 12 December the same year. The film explores a parallel theme of an underground revolution brimming underneath following the Partition of Bengal in 1905 and the hanging of Khudiram Bose for attempting to kill Kingsford in 1908. Nagendra (Shankar Chakraborty) leads a group of young freedom fighters in a fight to eliminate high-ranking British officers with indigenous bombs and fire-arms without harming the old, the women and the children. He castigates one of his revolutionaries, also a Mohun Bagan player, for paying more attention to football than to the revolution. But over time, he is convinced that this final match is no less than the revolution he is leading. He comes to the finals and motivates the same member he threw out to rise and play when he faints during the match felled by one of the many false kicks of the British team. Mohun Bagan had entered the finals after having vanquished strong teams of the British side such as Rangers, St. Xaviers and Middlesex which consolidated the team's confidence that the British teams were not as unconquerable as they thought. East Yorkshire Regiment scored one goal before half-time sending the entire audience into a tizzy and depressing the home team. But after half-time, the team scored two goals one by Captain Sibdas Bhaduri and the other by Abhilash Ghosh, a striker. The preparation towards the final match spans a major slice of the film including family and personal hurdles the team members face. Abhilash is a student at Scottish Church College, along with teammate Rajen Sengupta. Abhilash's father does not care about his brilliant son's involvement in a game that might anger the British rulers. Abhilash himself begins to rethink his stance because football, he feels, has reduced his duties towards those he loves. Sudhir Chatterjee, professor in the London Missionary Society College is insulted in the staff room by his British colleagues for daring to participate in a match against a British team. The Principal suspends him indefinitely. But Shibdas is determined to win even if one or two of the team drop out at the last minute. They don't. Two British citizens prove that they too, are human. One of them is the match referee Puller who refuses to bend under pressure by the powers- that-be to treat the match as a ‘must-win-or-else’ ego trip against native Indians. The other is Piggot, a player of the Middlesex team who was badly injured in one eye by an inadvertent kick delivered by Abhilash. He gives Abhilash a clean chit though the officers who visit him at the hospital urge him to pronounce the Indian team player's kick as intentional. Egaro is a sports film where reality has been intermixed with elements of fiction. This makes the film more entertaining and exciting, filled with moments of suspense, hilarity, drama and a bit of romance thrown in delicately between Abhilash and Bina and the one-sided attraction his British colleague, the beautiful Elina feels towards her colleague Sudhir. Her reactions on the field where she sits on the British side and when Mohun Bagan scores each goal, she begins to fan herself rapidly to express her joy. The reactions of the audience provide a wonderful sense of relief and bonhomie and solidarity and patriotism bonded as one. Though three of the eight players are professional football players, their acting is beyond par and one cannot make the difference between the actors and the players. The cameos are wonderfully portrayed by renowned actors of Bengali cinema, theatre and television. The revolutionary segment is a bit overdrawn and dramatic at times. The tremendous violence by the police who kill revolutionary Satyen's grandfather in prison could have been cut out. The flames of his pyre arousing flames of anger within his granddaughter Bina is a powerful touch. Gopi Bhagat's cinematography in one word is brilliant. Indraneel Ghosh's art direction reproduces the period with old mansions and homes with brick walls with the plaster peeling off, the roadside shop selling hot fritters, the college staff room, the prison cell with amazing accuracy. Mayukh-Moinak's music is very good but the background score by Arijit Singh is a bit too loud drowning the ambient sounds and the dialogue at some places. Inaccuracies * The opening scene shows a car carrying British officials being blown up by the Indian revolutionaries. The car shown is a Citroen DS which began production in 1955, and hence impossible to be owned by the British in 1911. * The British police in 1911 Calcutta are shown wearing white uniforms. The white uniform of Calcutta police was introduced in 1923 by the then Commissioner, Sir Charles Augustus Tegart, prior to which Calcutta Police wore khaki uniforms like the rest of the country. * The armored cars used by the Calcutta Police in 1911 are actually Army Vehicles used during World War II which did not come into existence nearly 30 years after the setting of the film. * The Indian revolutionaries are shown brandishing an Indian flag of a design which was first used in the 1929 Congress Session. * While discussing the need to spread the fire of the revolution to other parts of India like Punjab and Maharashtra, Nagen makes a reference to the city of Chandigarh, the capital of today's Indian state of Punjab, which came into existence only after 1947. * The language shown to be used by the footballers in the film is the present- day Calcutta dialect. In reality, most of the footballers were immigrants from Eastern Bengal (present day Bangladesh) and would have spoken in the Bangal dialect of the early 1910s. The film makers apologize for this error in a pre- title screen. * The language shown to be used in the 1911 newspapers is common Spoken Bengali. Common Bengali only began to be used as a printed language of newspapers in the 1970s, prior to which Sanskritised and Archaic Bengali was usually used in the newspapers. * The languages shown to be used in the dialogues is highly contemporary and uses some figures of speech which were not in use before the 1990s. * An Indian clerk in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is shown to be shaking in fear while asking for leave from a British supervisor. Though included probably for adding some dramatic effect, such a situation would have never occurred as in reality a Municipality clerk in 1911 would have asked for leave from a Head Clerk, who would have also been an Indian. * An Indian professor in a college in 1911 is shown to be called a \\"dirty Indian dog\\" by one of his colleagues, a British professor. This is a highly improbable incident more akin to the late 1700s than to the early 1900s. * One of the British footballers is shown to be having a spiky hairstyle, which only came into practice in the late 1990s. * Two of the British footballers are shown to be walking into a completely Indian neighbourhood all alone in an afternoon and kick and beat up a physically handicapped Indian without any kind of provocation. Though not impossible, this would have been a highly improbable incident. * Most of the British footballers are shown to be speaking with South African or Irish accents. * (Not true) The film shows the British footballers mercilessly hitting the barefooted Indian footballers' legs with their steel spikes and causing severe bleeding, concussions, bruises, fractures and causing some of them to leave the field and lose consciousness. Again added for dramatic effect, this portrayal is also completely unfounded. The only footballer to have a slight injury in the match was a British player who twisted his ankle. * The Mohun bagan striker Abhilash Ghosh is portrayed as a very young man barely out of his teens, who is lanky, thin, fair, rather delicate and slightly built. The real Abhilash Ghosh was in his late twenties and a dark, stout and extremely broad man who was extremely aggressive in the field and was nicknamed \\"Black Bull\\" by his British opponents. * The Mohun Bagan Captain Sibdas Bhaduri is shown to be a fiery and emotional man who leads by example and motivation. In reality, Sibdas was a quite and unassuming man who spoke very little and mostly kept to himself off the field. * The Mohun Bagan midfielder Rajendranath Sengupta is shown to be involved in the extremist Indian Revolutionary movement when off the field, the extent that he practises shooting a pistol, smuggles bombs and plans attacks on British convoys. The real Rajendranath, though supportive of the Indian Revolutionary Movement was not known to be directly involved in its activities. He was more of a scholar and a sportsman who worked as a football commentator for Calcutta Radio until his retirement and subsequent death in 1962. * The first goal scored by the British in the match is shown to be from a free kick, which is incorrect. In reality it was a field goal which was scored from normal play. * The winner scored by Abhilash Ghosh is shown to be a header scored from the rebound of a bicycle kick. In reality this was also a field goal scored from normal play where the ball 'rolled into the net'.

It covers over 18 acres (1 km²) and over 19,000 are buried there. Notable graves include first person to survive going over Niagara Falls in a barrel Annie Edson Taylor, Judge Augustus Porter, and first person to swim the English Channel Captain Matthew Webb. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs In 2014 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Overview Celebrating its 161st anniversary in 2013, Historic Oakwood Cemetery and the Oakwood Mausoleum were facing needs for the maintenance of this beautiful Niagara Falls treasure. The Board of Directors of the Oakwood Cemetery Association voted unanimously in 2010 to embark on a restoration project for the cemetery and the mausoleum. Local, state, and National Register designations are being pursued to both protect the historic site and to make it eligible for public and private historic preservation grants. A historic landscape report will evaluate the cemetery grounds and recommend a plan for restoration and a historic conditions report will accomplish a similar goal for the Mausoleum. Historic Oakwood Cemetery was begun in 1852 on land donated by Lavinia Porter, daughter of Judge Augustus Porter. The Judge was one of the acknowledged founders of Niagara Falls, and one of its largest landowners. The original layout of the cemetery was designed by Civil Engineer T.D. Judah. The Oakwood landscape we know today dates from a design drawn in 1882 by noted Niagara Falls civil engineer Drake Whitney (nephew to the three Whitney sisters for which \\"Three Sisters Islands\\" are named.) In 1913, Oakwood built a magnificent marble mausoleum, designed by the Buffalo architectural firm Green and Wicks. The Oakwood Mausoleum was built to the very highest standards with foot-thick walls of concrete covered by hand cut gray Vermont marble. The exterior features soaring stone columns supporting a centered entrance portico. Within were crypts for over 350 interred individuals, and the interior was faced and floored in white Vermont marble, lit by clerestory windows and two stained glass windows (one by Louis Comfort Tiffany). Huge bronze doors enter into a chapel space centered in the mausoleum. Oakwood would become the final resting place for families whose names are associated with the growth and development of Niagara Falls as a great industrial city and a world-renowned tourist attraction. Along with the Whitneys, these families include the Schoelkopfs of hydroelectric power fame, the Oppenheims, the Silberbergs, the Pfohls, the Haeberles, the Tattersalls, the Holleys, and both Porter brothers. Among those buried at Oakwood, one finds Annie Edson Taylor, the first person to travel over the falls in a barrel, Homan Walsh, the young kite flyer whose kite and progressively larger ropes sent the cable across the gorge for the suspension bridge, and the famed \\"Hermit of Goat Island\\". The cemetery also includes a memorial to \\"Comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic\\", veterans of the Civil War, and there is one Commonwealth service war grave, of a Canadian soldier of World War II. Oakwood today contains many examples of funerary art including obelisks, sarcophogi, and statuary. Additionally, the landscape contains mature plantings and trees, many dating from the earliest time of the cemetery. It continues to serve the community with the crematory, columbarium, and gravesites, including newly available family plots formed by the expansion of previously smaller burial sites.

As a dancer, she studied ballet for many years in New York with Russian teachers Vera Nemtchinova and Vladimir Dokoudovsky. Then she studied Egyptian-style Oriental dance for many years with the famous Egyptian choreographer Yousry Sharif, as well as with choreographer Mahmoud Reda in Cairo. Career Berl's music has innovated what she calls a Chakra form, arrived at using serial techniques and interval cycle theory connected to the Passacaglia form. \\"Elegy\\" (1974) is completely in this form, \\"The Lord of the Dance\\" (1989) ends with a chakra and there are several chakras in \\"Masmoudi\\" for violin and piano (2012). She has served as artistic consultant for Tirreno Records. Peter Serkin premiered her piece, \\"Lord of the Dance,\\" in 1989 and played it again in 1990 at the 92nd Street Y Distinguished Artists Series (the piece was commissioned by him in 1989). The pianist Carlo Levi Minzi has recorded two of Berl's works, \\"Elegy\\" and \\"Lord of the Dance,\\" on Rusty Records. \\"Dark Summer\\" was written for Frederica von Stade and commissioned by the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society in 1989. The pianist was Richard Goode. \\"Elegy\\" was also performed by Andre-Michel Schub on the Princeton University concert series in 1976 and by Emanuel Ax at the Ravinia Fall Festival in 1988. \\"Ab la Dolchor\\" (text by Henry Weinfield) for mezzo, clarinet, piano, viola, cello was premiered by Richard Stoltzman in 1990 at the 92nd Street Y concert entitled \\"The Music of Christine Berl.\\" As a dancer, Berl has performed widely in nightclubs in Morocco. An article on her as a dancer appeared in the New York Times, July 31, 1999. Her most recent activity has been in the field of photo modelling, working in a great diversity of genres. Some of the photographers she has worked with have been Simon Cave (Vicinus exhibit at the Ludlow Gallery NYC 2015), Henri Senders, Sergio Maier, Vlad Kenner, Debinevsky, Boris Mirkin, Alessandro Didoni, Pablo Massa and Carney Malone.

Forming out of a trough of low pressure on 19 January 2011 to the northwest of Fiji, Cyclone Wilma initially tracked eastward towards the Samoan Islands. On 22 January, the system took a sharp southward turn, bringing its centre directly over American Samoa the following day. After turning towards the southwest and accelerating, Wilma steadily intensified into a severe tropical cyclone before striking Tonga. The storm reached its peak intensity on 26 January as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Gradually re-curving towards the southeast, Wilma weakened quickly as it moved over cooler sea surface temperatures; by 28 January, it was downgraded to a tropical cyclone. Later that day, the storm brushed the North Island of New Zealand before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Throughout Wilma's path, three countries were affected, with New Zealand experiencing the most severe damage. At least three fatalities in American Samoa have been blamed on the storm, two from flooding and one from high seas. In Tonga, \\"major damage\\" was reported across the Ha'apai Islands. In New Zealand, several homes were destroyed by the storm and hundreds of people were evacuated. However, there were no reports of fatalities. Torrential rain in the country, exceeding in some places, triggered 50-year flood events and isolated towns. Meteorological history Early on 19 January, RSMC Nadi reported that Tropical Disturbance 06F had developed along a trough of low pressure about to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. During that day convection surrounding the disturbance gradually became more organised, and early the next day, RSMC Nadi reported that it had intensified into a tropical depression. On 22 January, The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the system as Tropical Cyclone '08P'. Later the same day, RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 06F to a tropical cyclone and named it 'Wilma'. Early on 24 January, RSMC Nadi further upgraded Wilma to a Category 2 Tropical Cyclone, and then Category 3 later that day. Wilma continued to strengthen and on 26 January, the RSMC Nadi upgraded it into a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone. Early on 27 January, Wilma entered TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility. A few hours later, TCWC Wellington took full responsibility of Wilma, and downgraded it into a Category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone. The next day, Wilma continued to weaken and TCWC Wellington further downgraded it into a tropical cyclone. Later that day, the JTWC, issuing their final warning, reported that the system took a southeast curve along the coast of North Island, New Zealand and started becoming extratropical. A few hours later, the TCWC Wellington discontinued advisories, no longer considering it a tropical cyclone. Preparations, Impact and aftermath =American Samoa= Following harsh criticism for the lack of a warning siren after the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami, in which more than 100 perished, the American Samoan Government ensured that residents were aware of Cyclone Wilma several days prior to its arrival. Many people boarded up their homes and Homeland Security was on standby in case of evacuations. As a precautionary measure, ten shelters were also opened on the island. On 23 January, Wilma passed directly over American Samoa, bringing winds in excess of 95 km/h (60 mph). The local National Weather Service office recorded sustained winds of with gusts to while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory on Cape Matatula, Tutuila, observed sustained winds of and gusts of . These winds downed numerous trees and power lines, leaving several towns and cities without electricity. Several structures also had their roofs blown off. Heavy rains amounting to triggered a few landslides but overall damage was light. With that, the Pago Pago International Airport was closed and the American Samoa Governor, Togiola Tulafono ordered local government agencies to help those in need. Wilma caused severe damage to the StarKist Samoa tuna cannery which was then shut down for a week. Across the region, three fatalities due to drowning were blamed on the storm. One of these was a child who was swept away by a swollen river while he was playing near it. In the days after Wilma's passage, health officials warned residents to stay away from standing water as it may have been contaminated to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases. Following preliminary assessments of damage, Governor Tulafono stated that there was sufficient losses to warrant an emergency declaration from President Barack Obama. However, he also requested that a second, in-depth report of the situation be made to better determine how to move forward; the second assessment was set to start on 27 January. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, power and water supplies were restored to all areas by 25 January and the airport was set to reopen that day. Harbours were to remain closed for several more days as debris was being cleared from coastal waters. =Tonga and Lau Islands= After Wilma moved over American Samoa, a tropical cyclone alert was issued in Tonga and Lau Islands. On the morning of 25 January, Wilma blew over Tonga as a severe tropical cyclone. Major damage was reported in the Ha'apai Islands of Tonga. Wilma also disrupted New Zealand Foreign Minister, Murray McCully's trip to Tonga. Throughout Tonga, damage amounted to $3 million. =New Zealand= Flooding in Kaukapakapa after Cyclone Wilma According to the media, Wilma was expected to approach the coasts of Cape Reinga on 29 January, as a Category 2 Tropical Cyclone. In combination with previous flooding expected to be worsened by Wilma, officials in New Zealand evacuated numerous towns in the Thames-Coromandel District. At least 70 people sought refuge in public shelters during the storm. As Cyclone Wilma brushed the North Island, it brought torrential rains to much of the region, with several areas recording during a 24‑hour span. One station recorded in 12–14 hours. With this, several areas neared record-breaking rainfall totals for the month of January. These rains, in combination with heavy rains a week prior, caused several rivers to swell. One river, the Whakatane, was expected to reach levels seen in 50-year flood events. Large amounts of debris was reported to be flowing down rivers into the ocean. High winds accompanying these rains caused significant damage as well; several homes were destroyed and electricity was cut off to many towns and cities as power lines were felled. Numerous roads across the island were shut down due to treacherous conditions. Two rural towns, Waimana and Ruatoki Valley, were isolated by flooding as high water covered all roads leading to and from the areas. In parts of the Coromandel Peninsula, sewage treatment plants were overwhelmed by the amount of rain and began spilling raw sewage into nearby communities as well as Whangamata harbour. Along the slopes of Mount Maunganui, campers were forced to evacuate in the middle of the night as flood waters began to threaten their rest areas. Several landslides were also reported during the passage of Wilma, cutting off roads and damaging homes. On Waiheke Island, two residents managed to escape their cottage, after the family dog began barking outside, before the hill it was situated on gave way, destroying their house. Throughout New Zealand, damage from Wilma was at least NZ$25 million (US$19 million). While other cyclones have weakened and turned into extratropical storms that then hit New Zealand, Cyclone Wilma is the first known to hit New Zealand as a tropical cyclone. =Retirement= The name Wilma was retired in 2012 and was replaced with Wano.

Wisconsin, 347 U.S. 672 (1954), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that sale of natural gas at the wellhead was subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act.. Prior to this case, independent producers sold natural gas to interstate pipelines at unregulated prices with any subsequent sales for resale being regulated. The State of Wisconsin sought to close this regulatory loophole in order to keep consumer prices low. Natural gas producers argued that wellhead sales were exempt from federal regulation as \\"production and gathering.\\" Below, the Federal Power Commission compiled an evidentiary record 10,000 pages long before deciding not to regulate wellhead sales. However, the courts reversed, and the case resulted in federal price controls on wellhead gas prices for the next 40 years. Background Natural gas is typically produced in association with oil from wells. Wells can also be drilled into geological formations that have mostly gas and very little oil. In the infancy of the oil industry, any natural gas produced from oil wells was burned off. Later, states passed conservation laws which required the gas to be captured and transported in pipelines for useful purposes. In order to prevent any gaps in the natural gas regulation when natural gas flows in interstate commerce, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act of 1938. That law required that companies must obtain from the Federal Power Commission (FPC) a \\"certificate of public convenience and necessity\\" (certificate) before making any sale for resale natural gas in interstate commerce.. The FPC set the maximum prices charged for gas sold under a certificate.. For example, if gas flowed from a well in Texas through a pipeline to New York where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. The final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law. Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the \\"production and gathering\\" of gas was exempt from federal regulation,Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act provides, \\"The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale, and to the importation or exportation of natural gas in foreign commerce and to persons engaged in such importation or exportation, but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.\\" although potentially subject to state control. Production means bringing the gas out of the ground to a pipe at the top of the wellhead. Gathering refers to the flow of gas through low pressure lines to the center of a gas field where the gas is treated and compressed to bring it up to the high pressures used in long-distance pipelines. Oil companies claimed that because production and gathering was exempt, any sales between the oil company that owned the well and the pipeline company were also exempt from Natural Gas Act regulation if they took place at the wellhead or along the gathering lines. The producers wanted to charge a wellhead price based on market forces, while consumer groups argued that the Natural Gas Act intended that both producers and pipelines should be limited to cost-based rate regulation, so that the final price paid by consumers would represent only the cost of producing, transporting and distributing the gas, instead of a price based on the cost of competing fuels, such as fuel oil. From 1938 to 1954, the FPC did not regulate wellhead prices. However, these prices were very low because the amount of available gas supply exceeded the pipeline capacity to move it to national markets. However, after World War II, wellhead gas prices rose even to the point that producers started to drill new gas-only wells in areas that contained little oil. The State of Wisconsin claimed that the absence of federal wellhead price regulation caused the delivered price of gas in Wisconsin to reach unreasonable levels. Wisconsin wanted the FPC to regulate wellhead gas sales. Proceedings below The FPC was a five-member regulatory body appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.. One of the FPC's strongest leaders was Leland Olds. Olds' insistence on enforcing the Natural Gas Act of 1938 raised the ire of the oil industry in Texas and led to the end of his tenure at the FPC. Robert Caro's book Master of the Senate describes how Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Leland's re-appointment by orchestrating a McCarthyism-style smear campaign. The tactics involved having the staff of the House Un-American Activities Committee dig up old writings, which were then taken out of context to falsely paint Olds as a communist. The subcommittee in charge of reappointment was stacked against Leland and coached by Johnson. Following such episodes, the FPC was reluctant to impose price regulation on the producers. Phillips Petroleum Company (now ConocoPhillips) was a very large operator in the petroleum industry and a very large producer, gatherer, and processor of natural gas from wells in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Phillips owned and operated nine gathering systems and gas processing plants that sold gas to interstate pipelines at unregulated prices.347 U.S. at 675. The State of Wisconsin represented the interest of consumers who purchases gas from the pipelines that in turn purchased the gas from Phillips.Phillips sold gas to the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. that sold gas to gas distributors in Wisconsin. Wisconsin wanted the FPC to regulate Phillips' sale prices. Wisconsin argued that the \\"production and gathering\\" exemption applied to the physical movement of gas and not to any sales of gas. On October 28, 1948, while Olds was still chair, the FPC started an investigation into Phillips' jurisdictional status and whether its rates were unjust and unreasonable. The FPC heard testimony and read exhibits filling close to 10,000 pages of the case record. Gas producing states told the FPC that FPC regulation wellhead sales would interfere with state conservation rules and regulations.205 F.2d at 714. After Olds left the Commission, the FPC held that although the sale by Phillips to the pipelines was a \\"sale for resale in interstate commerce,\\" it was exempt under the \\"production and gathering\\" exception. Wisconsin appealed FPC's refusal to regulate to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.10 F.P.C. 246.Review of FPC actions are heard by the Court of Appeals without first going to a federal District Court. . Circuit Judges Edgerton, Clark, and Prettyman heard the appeal, and Edgerton wrote the opinion, Wisconsin v. FPC 205 F.2d 706 (D.C. Cir. 1953), which reversed the FPC and held that the \\"production and gathering\\" phrase did not include sales. Circuit Judge Clark wrote a dissent which agreed with Phillips, because Clark saw production and gathering as subject to regulation by the state where the well was located. Hence, Clark argued that federal regulation of producers is unnecessary. Clark also argued that the reviewing courts should defer to the FPC's interpretation of the statute.205 F.2d at 715. Supreme Court The court heard argument on April 6–7, 1954. Justice Sherman Minton noted that in Federal Power Commission v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., 337 U.S. 498, 337 U.S. 505, the Supreme Court wrote that the \\"natural and clear meaning\\" of the phrase \\"production or gathering of natural gas\\" is that it encompasses \\"the producing properties and gathering facilities of a natural gas company.\\" The court read the exemption as not applying to gas sales.347 U.S. 682-84. Minton's opinion noted, \\"the legislative history indicates a congressional intent to give the Commission jurisdiction over the rates of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce, whether by a pipeline company or not and whether occurring before, during, or after transmission by an interstate pipeline company. There can be no dispute that the overriding congressional purpose was to plug the 'gap' in regulation of natural gas companies....\\"347 U.S. at 682 Minton justified asserting jurisdiction over wellhead sales because, \\"Protection of consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies was the primary aim of the Natural Gas Act.\\"347 U.S. at 685. Further, Minton noted that Congress had failed to pass bills that proposed to amend the law to clearly exempt wellhead sales. Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred with the court's decision. He noted that the purpose of the Natural Gas Act was to occupy the gap in state regulation caused by the earlier Supreme Court cases which held that states could not regulate interstate gas or electric transactions. Because states could not regulate sales for resale on gathering lines, Frankfurter argued that Congress intended the FPC to regulate such sales. Justice William O. Douglas dissented. He noted that Congress had the power to subject sales by \\"independent producers\\" to federal regulation, but that it drafted the Natural Gas Act in a way that chose not to regulate them. He noted, \\"Whether it did so by the Natural Gas Act of 1938 is a political and legal controversy that has raged in the Commission and in the Congress for some years. The question is not free from doubts.\\"347 U.S. at 688. Justice Douglas predicted that it would be difficult to develop a cost-based rate for gas sold by independent producers.347 U.S. at 689. Justice Tom C. Clark dissented along with Justice Burton. Clark wrote, \\"The natural gas industry, like ancient Gaul, is divided into three parts. These parts are production and gathering, interstate transmission by pipeline, and distribution to consumers by local distribution companies.\\"347 U.S. at 691. Justice Clark believed that \\"federal regulation of [producer] sales means an inevitable clash with a complex of state regulatory action, including minimum pricing.\\"347 U.S. at 698. So Clark recognized that producing states were actively regulating producers with the objective of keeping prices high and the quantity of gas production uniform, which may conflict with federal and consuming states regulators that sought to keep prices low and the quantity of gas abundant.347 U.S. at 695-96. Aftermath As a result of the Supreme Court decision, the FPC suddenly had to issue certificates for each interstate producer and to set cost-based prices for such sales. This resulted in a huge regulatory back log. The FPC's regulation of producers was so backlogged that when President-elect John F. Kennedy appointed James M. Landis, Dean of the Harvard Law School, to provide a transition team report in 1960, Landis declared it to be \\"the outstanding example in the federal government of the breakdown of the administrative process.\\"Landis wrote, \\"In the Federal Power Commission the backlog of pending cases in 1959 was almost four times as great as in 1957. Only last September that Commission announced that it would take 13 years with its present staff to clear up its pending 2,313 producer rate cases pending as of July 1, 1960, and that with the contemplated 6500 cases that would be filed during that 13 year period it could not become current until 2043 A.D. even if its staff were tripled.\\" p. 5. The FPC dropped well-by-well regulation for setting wellhead prices on an area-wide basis on September 28, 1960.Landis Report at 38. Later the FPC adopted a nationwide approach for setting wellhead ceiling prices. Despite the regulatory delays, the decision resulted in lower natural gas prices for consumers particularly during the times of rapid oil price increases during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. However, with interstate gas prices kept low under FPC regulation, an alternative network of intrastate pipelines developed in gas producing states offering higher gas prices. Producers sought to sell gas into the intrastate markets whenever possible, resulting in natural gas shortages in the interstate market. Finally, Congress in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 established a substitute set of wellhead prices set by statute and merged the interstate and intrastate gas markets. Ultimately, Congress deregulated all wellhead natural gas prices effective January 1, 1993, with the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (NGWDA) of 1989.

The winery is situated atop Mission Hill overlooking a 145 kilometre lake, mountains and vineyards. History Mission Hill Winery buildings and bell tower Mission Hill Family Estate was established in 1966. Anthony von Mandl was a wine seller in Vancouver during the 1970s and assisted in preparing a feasibility study regarding growing grapes in the area for Josef Milz, a Mosel based winery. While the German vintner did not go ahead with a purchase, von Mandl decided that the area was worth investing in, and in 1981 purchased the abandoned Mission Hill estate. von Mandl is also the founder of Mike's Hard Lemonade Co.. The first Chardonnay made by John Simes, who had just joined the winery, in the 1992 vintage won the trophy for \\"Best Chardonnay\\" at the 1994 International Wine and Spirit Competition, becoming the first Okanagan winery to receive significant overseas recognition. Olson Kundig Architects were commissioned in 1996 to rebuild the winery and associated buildings. This was the first winery project undertaken by the design firm. The work was completed in 2002 at an estimated cost of thirty-five million Canadian dollars. The centrepiece and focal point of the design was a twelve-story and 85 foot high bell tower, with four bells cast by Fonderie Paccard in Annecy, France who also crafted the bells for St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and Sacré-Cœur in Paris. The largest bell weighs nearly 800 kilograms. Vineyards Until 1996, Mission Hill had purchased grapes from vineyards owned by others to produce wine, with no vineyard holdings of its own. It started to purchase its own vineyards in 1996. Mission Hill Family Estate farms 32 family-owned estate vineyards in the Okanagan Valley. Mission Hill has estate vineyards in each of the five growing regions; West Kelowna, East Kelowna, Naramata Bench, Black Sage Bench in Southeast Oliver and Osoyoos. Most of the vineyards are planted on benches above the valley floor; on varying degrees of slope that assist with air drainage, improves frost protection and increases the amount of sun the vines receive. Wines and winemaking The current chief winemaker is Darryl Brooker who joined the winery in 2015. Michel Rolland, a prominent French oenologist, has been consulting at the estate since 2005. Mission Hill estate produces wines across four tiers. Their entry level wines are labeled as \\"Five Vineyards\\". The next tier are the \\"Reserve\\" wines, followed by the \\"Terroir Collection\\" and the top-tier \\"Legacy\\" series. The flagship \\"Oculus\\" is a Bordeaux style red wine made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It is named after circular windows used in classical architecture. Other Terrace restaurant overlooking Lake Okanagan The estate has a sixty-seat restaurant called \\"Terrace\\" that opened in 2002. It overlooks Lake Okanagan. In 2008 it was named by Travel + Leisure magazine as one of the five best winery restaurants in the world.

It was the highest-budget Indian film at that time. The film was directed by Satish Kaushik and written by Javed Akhtar. The project, announced in 1987, was initially directed by Shekhar Kapur, who left the project halfway through; he was subsequently replaced by Satish Kaushik. Despite its massive budget, which was escalated by the delay, it flopped miserably at the box office upon its release in 1993. Plot Jagmohan Lal aka Jugran is a crime lord who wants to climb up the crime ladder. When Customs Officer Verma tries to arrest him, he escapes. To save his skin, Jugran kills his twin brother Manmohan Lal and takes his identity. The world is led to believe that Jugran is still on the run. Jugran kills Verma and Dr Ashok, destroying both their families in process. While Verma's orphaned sons Ramesh and Ravi are separated from each other, Dr Ashok's daughter Seema is left with her distraught mother, who has lost her sanity. Many years later, Jugran has become a big name in the criminal underworld. He lives a double life, acting also as his twin brother Manmohan, who is highly respected in society. Ravi Verma meanwhile, has become an Inspector and Ramesh has become a crook – a safecracker by the name of Romeo. The brothers are unaware of each other's identities, but there is one things that binds them together: one has a lock, the other has the only key that can open the lock. Seema too has become a crook, called Simmi, and her path starts crossing with Romeo's. Romeo is now working for Seth Girdharilal, who mentors many thieves and thugs like him. Only Ravi knows that Jugran killed his father. One day Seema runs into \\"Manmohan\\", and realizes that it was he who had killed her father. Jugran himself needs somebody to pull a Rs 100 crore robbery. He meets her (as Jugran) and tells her that he will need her help to involve Romeo in the operation. Simmi hesitates, until Jugran reveals that he knows the identity of her father's murderer. She meets Romeo and tries to seduce him, but Romeo berates her. Simmi reveals her story to him. Romeo is surprised to see Simmi's mother, since it means that Simmi is actually his childhood sweetheart Seema. Now he reveals his true identity to Seema, and the two pair up. Meanwhile, Ravi too gets an inkling that Jugran is planning something big with help of Simmi and Romeo. Ravi and Romeo run into each other, only to learn that they are brothers. After many twists and turns, Simmi and Romeo finally succeed in turning over the loot to Jugran. After they do this, he binds and gags them after telling Simmi the truth, leaving the pair to die by falling into a container of boiling acid. They are saved by Romeo's pet pigeon. Romeo and Simmi escape, but they get separated from each other. Romeo runs into Ravi, whereupon the latter tries to arrest him. After Romeo tells him the truth, an enraged Ravi reveals to Ramesh that Jugran killed their father too. Ramesh escapes and rejoins Simmi. When he sees \\"Manmohan\\" on TV, Ramesh tells Seema that Manmohan and Jugran are the same person. Meanwhile, Ravi gets a tip-off, upon which he turns up at a party almost simultaneously with Ramesh and Seema. Ramesh reveals that when his pigeon perched on Jugran's left hand it left claw marks, just as seen on Manmohan's left hand. Therefore, Manmohan and Jugran are same person. Ravi scoffs at the claim and tells them that Manmohan's fingerprints are available and it won't be difficult to find out that Manmohan and Jugran are indeed two different people. Seeing that his charade is about to come to an abrupt end, Jugran tries to run away. It is revealed that Ramesh had given the tip-off about Jugran to Ravi. Jugran succeeds in escaping, while his men try to kill Ravi, Ramesh and Seema. The three manage to fight their way to Jugran, who himself tries to shoot them. The trio quickly retaliate, killing him on spot.

It is nowadays (2011) only visible as an area of permanent water in the Scottish Wildlife Trust Sourlie Nature Reserve. The loch was natural, sitting in a hollow created by glaciation. The loch waters outflow was via the Red Burn that flows into the River Garnock. The site of Littlestane Loch site is partly built over and much of the site is now public open space lying within the Parish of Girdle Toll. History Sourlie pond on the site of the old loch. Blaeu's map of 1654, derived from the early 1600s survey by Timothy PontBlaeu's Map Retrieved : 2011-01-25 shows the loch as a substantial oval shaped body of water with an outflow via the Red Burn. Direct rainfall and runoff were the main inflows. Roy's map of 1747-55 clearly marks the loch, although much reduced in extent. A Loch Wards habitation is marked in the vicinity of the old loch.Roy's Map Retrieved : 2011-01-25 Littlestane Farm, recorded as 'Litle Stain' is marked as being on the northern end of Littlestane Loch in the 1600s, however by the 1750s the farmstead was no longer on its edge due to its contraction. Related placenames on Pont's map are 'Lichmil' or Loch Mill and 'Thurland' or Thirled land. Ordnance Survey maps of the 19th century show the loch site as a marshy area extending into the Sourlie Woods and as an area of marshy land close to Lawthorn Wood. The old Irvine Burgh boundary is marked on OS maps as running up the Red Burn, then following the curve of the old Littlestane lochshore before extending through the old Sourlie Woods site. In 1845 the loch was used for a curling match between Dundonald and a Monkton and Prestwick team. Dundonald won by 91 shots with 32 players on each team. The loch was recorded as Sourley Loch.Historical Curling Places =The draining of Littlestane Loch= The outflow of this shallow loch was into the Red Burn, which now is now piped in the vicinity of the loch and downstream only flows in a canalised form, diverted in places, into the River Garnock. The Perceton Branch of the Glasgow and South Western Railway ran across the site, as does the A736 Lochlibo Road. A mineral line is shown in 1910 running to Fergushill Collieries numbers 29 and 30, the railway embankment being built across the loch bed. As stated, the loch shrunk between 1600 and the 1750s, existing only as marshy areas on the first OS maps of the 1850s and not featuring on maps of the early 1800s. The loch's drainage may have begun in the 18th century when Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton, was pursuing a number of agricultural improvements on his extensive estates. Intensive drainage work may have taken place in the 1740s as part of the improvements undertaken to provide employment for Irish Montgomerie estate workers during the Irish potato famines of the 1740s and the mid 19th centuries. Many drainage schemes also date to the end of World War I when many soldiers returned en masse to civilian life.MacIntosh, Pages 37 & 39 =The Drukken Steps= A minor link with Robert Burns is the existence of the nearby site of the Drukken Steps over the Red Burn in the old Eglinton Woods near Stanecastle at NS 329 404, was a favourite haunt of Robert Burns and his friend Richard Brown whilst the two were in Irvine in 1781 - 82.Love, page 60.

It is one of the oldest Czech companies. The person who played a very important part in establishing the company was František Dittrich (who later became a mayor of Prague). Prague Steamboat Company was established as a purely Czech company in 1865 when, after receiving a concession from Emperor Franz Josef I, it launched the steamboat Praha (Prague) on the route from Prague to Štěchovice (a small town about 20 km south of Prague). The first years were not easy mainly due to the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, however, two decades later the company flourished in the economic boom that began in 1884. More steamboats were being built and in 1902 operations between Prague and Klecany (a village situated to the north of Prague) were launched. After World War I the fleet comprised 8 large and 2 smaller paddle wheelers and 13 propeller steamboats. A new route from Prague through Mělník to Litoměřice and on the central Elbe River above Mělník was opened. The economic crisis combined with competition from bus line transport, the construction of the Vrané Dam and other factors nearly led PPS to bankruptcy in 1936. The company was taken over by Czechoslovak Joint Stock Elbe Steamboat Company while preserving the original name. In 1961 the company was incorporated into Prague Public Transport Company. Problems with the maintenance of steam engines brought about the retirement of several paddle wheelers and in 1970 only four remained in operation. After the Iron Curtain collapsed the company got its independence back and within a few years it was able to adapt itself to a market economy when it became part of the EVD group (Evropská vodní doprava, s.r.o. – European Water Transport).

The warehouses, which occupy a site of 27 hectares, are named after the Soviet political functionary Aleksei Badayev. From October 1917 they were used to store food reserves. At the beginning of the siege of Leningrad the warehouses were bombed by German forces and burned, so that the city lost some of its food reserves. This event is mentioned in a song by Vladimir Vysotsky, \\"I grew up during the siege of Leningrad ...\\". In Luftwaffe raids on 8 and 10 September 1941, about 40 sheds at the Badayev warehouses were burned; 3000 tons of flour and 2500 tons of sugar were stored there, representing the city's reserves for 1–3 days, according to the current norms. Up to 1 ton of burnt flour and 900 tons of burnt sugar were partially processed by the city's food enterprises. For Leningrad's inhabitants the fire at the Badayev warehouses became a symbol of the famine of 1941-42. The idea that this fire was the main cause of the starvation in autumn and winter 1941-42 is wrong. After 1945 and until 1970 the rebuilt Badayev warehouses provided sheds for rent. On 20 May 2010 the warehouses burned again, possibly due to a campfire. In December 2010 the RESO-Garantia insurance company paid ₽30.8M for goods destroyed in the fire and belonging to one of the companies using the Badayev warehouses. The reconstruction of the warehouses is planned for the 2010s. The integrated development of the area involves the construction of of retail and office space. A new convention center and hotel complex of 3000 rooms will be built, consisting of three buildings. One of the hotels will be built as a dominant feature - its height is planned to be up to 140 meters. An area of 28 hectares will be renovated by the TriGranit realty company.

Daxter is voiced by Max Casella, Richard McGonagle, and Steve Blum (as Dark Daxter). Daxter stars in his own game, named after himself. Critics have been divided with the character, some calling him funny, others calling him annoying. Appearances Daxter first appears in Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, where he and Jak take a boat to Misty Island, a place Samos the Sage warned them against visiting. Daxter accidentally falls into a vat of Dark Eco, and he is turned into an ottsel (half otter, half weasel). Daxter's accident leads the story's plot as he seeks help from Gol, to turn him back to normal. In Jak II, a gate opens that sends Jak, Daxter, Keira, and Samos into Haven City, a future version of their world. As they appear, guards take Jak away to jail. Two years later, Daxter finds Jak and helps him break out of jail. They begin a quest to find out where they have been sent to, and meet back up with Keira and Samos. Along the way, they take jobs from a slum lord, Krew, and Daxter meets his love interest, Tess. After the events of the plot, Daxter takes over Krew's bar, and renames it the \\"Naughty Ottsel\\". In Jak 3, Jak is thrown out of Haven City, into the wasteland, and Daxter follows him. Near the end of the plot, it is revealed that Daxter is same species as the Precursors, a group of ancient beings said to have created the world and the Eco in it. As they save the world, the precursors grant Daxter the thing he most wishes for; a pair of pants, and turn his girlfriend, Tess, into an Ottsel so they can be together. Daxter takes place right after Jak and Daxter go through the warp gate, and are separated. An old man named Osmo offers Daxter a job exterminating Metal Bugs. Daxter accepts the job, and completes missions while also looking for Jak. In The Lost Frontier, Daxter goes to The Brink with Jak to help escort Keira in her quest to become a sage. Daxter is exposed to more Dark Eco and undergoes a further, but temporary, transformation into a form known as Dark Daxter, similar to Dark Jak. While as Dark Daxter, Daxter grows to about eight feet tall, can shoot Dark Eco blasts, and can spin around like a tornado. His personality also changes while in this form, becoming more aggressive and reckless. Both Jak and Daxter have appeared as one of the playable characters in the crossover fighting game PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Daxter also makes a cameo in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, where Daxter is shown on the arm of a wetsuit which says \\"OTTsel\\" on the front of it. Development and characteristics In an interview, Naughty Dog's creative director Dan Arey said that \\"Jak is the hero you want to be, and Daxter is the hero you're afraid you are. Daxter is just a little bit concerned, a little bit afraid and he would rather take the easy way out.\\" He also said they use Daxter as a \\"secret weapon\\" for when scenes start to get boring. Daxter is Jak's sidekick and closest friend. After falling in a vat of Dark Eco, he is transformed into an ottsel (half otter, half weasel). Before Daxter's accident, he was an orange-haired, buck-toothed cowardly boy that seemed to be the opposite to Jak's courageous and trouble-making self. Daxter often tries to impress women by using lousy pickup lines, much to Jak's chagrin. Daxter later gets a love interest of his own in Jak II, Tess, a weapon-designing blonde for the underground. Though Daxter rarely gets into dangerous situations on his own, he always exaggerates his stories to make him seem the hero. In The Lost Frontier, Daxter is exposed to more Dark Eco and undergoes a further, but temporary, transformation into a form known as Dark Daxter, similar to Dark Jak. While as Dark Daxter, Daxter grows to about eight feet tall, can shoot Dark Eco blasts, and can spin around like a tornado. His personality also changes while in this form, becoming more aggressive and reckless. Reception Daxter has received mixed reception, some calling him annoying, some calling him funny. In an interview, Didier Malenfant, president of Ready At Dawn, stated \\"Daxter, to my mind, really has been the best character in the whole series\\" Daxter won an award at the Game Developer's Conference for the best \\"Original Game Character of the Year\\" in 2001. IGN described Daxter as \\"a comical, truly amazingly animated creature-character that brings a new sense of wonder and joy to videogames\\", calling him \\"eminently likeable.\\" Daxter was listed as being the ninth-best video-game sidekick of all time by GameSpy, stating \\"We can't really talk about videogame sidekicks without a mention of the titular character in 2001's Jak and Daxter.\\" Daxter was listed by IGN as being the sixth-best PS2 sidekick, being described as being \\"funny as hell.\\" WhatCulture placed him at number 8 on their list of the 20 Greatest Sidekicks in Video Games. Game Informer called him the 5th greatest wingman of the past decade, calling him the life of the series. MSN Entertainment named him as one of \\"Gaming's unsung heroes\\", saying he \\"was popular enough to get his own game.\\" Conversely, Daxter was listed as one of the 15 most annoying video game characters by Cracked, stating \\"Daxter reminds us of that one friend who is always cracking jokes, but isn't any good at it.\\" Similarly, Daxter was listed fifth on 1UP.com's \\"Top 5 Worst Videogame Sidekicks\\", stating he acted like a \\"terrible '80s stand-up comic\\" On GamesRadar's \\"Top 7 Lazy Character Cliches\\", they listed \\"The Animal With Attitude\\", showing Daxter as an example.

The film stars Pushkar Shrotri, Rajesh Shrungarpure, Santosh Juvekar in lead roles. Gupte who is a singer and music director has also composed the music for the film. The film depicts the journey of four young ambitious scholars to succeed in life and the impact of a split in a major political party on their journey caused by a feud between two cousins in rival political parties. The story is inspired by the real-life feud between Raj Thackeray, chief of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and his cousin, Uddhav Thackeray, Executive President of Shiv Sena. Plot The movie is based on actual life of party workers who have aligned their loyalty towards a particular political party and also loosely based on the most reputed and powerful political family of Balasaheb Thackeray. It highlights the glorious past of party and strong organisation fighting for Marathi community in Maharashtra, India. The storyline depicts the plight of party workers who have aligned their loyalty towards a particular political party based on its apex leader. When the leadership baton is passed on to the next generation, one of the new leaders breaks away from the core. What follows is the rift between friends who were once bonded together by the cause led by the party and now finding themselves opposing each other. The movie also touches on the part where political images have been built completely based on media and PR exercises. Under pressure from the media campaign managers and in an attempt to please the monitory vote banks, the ideologies behind the parties are sacrificed, leaving the purists and youth betrayed. Amongst the betrayed are also the youth who break away to establish themselves from under the shadow of the older leadership, only to find that their good work left aside when it is time for an election ticket allotment.

Dak'Art's focus has been on Contemporary African Art since 1996.  History  The Dakar Biennale was conceived in 1989 as a biennale alternating between literature and art. The first edition in 1990 was focused on literature and in 1992 on visual art. In 1993 the structure of the biennale was transformed and Dak'Art 1996 became an exhibition specifically devoted to Contemporary African Art. In 1998 the structure was consolidated and in 2000 there was considerable change: Abdoulaye Wade was elected president of Senegal a few months before the opening of the event. The new president confirmed the support of the Senegalese government for the event and since 2000, Dak'Art has taken place bi-annually. Dak'Art 2002 was characterized by new staff and new partners. Dak'Art 2004 received more international visitors and wider press coverage; during the opening the president announced his intention to organise a new edition of the World Festival of Black Arts. For the first time an artistic director was appointed for Dak'Art 2006 and the event was organised with the participation of many artists and a more consistent budget. In 2008 the biennale decelerated. The event took place on a smaller budget and was organised at the last minute. In 2010 the European Commission - a major financial partner - did not support the event. In December the third edition of the World Festival of Black Arts was organised in Dakar. The 2014 edition was curated by Abdelkader Damani, Elise Atangana and Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi. The 2016 edition was curated by Simon Njami. Dak'Art is the African continent's longest running grand-scale art event. In 2014, it was opened to non-African nationals for the first time, with the exhibition 'Cultural Diversity' at the IFAN Theodore Monod Museum including invited internationals.

He studied at Charpentier, a licensed art history school at the Sorbonne,Biography Jean Arcelin in Delarge dictionary Retrieved February 4, 2011 where he developed an interest in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century painting. His paintings incorporate elements of false realism and figurative art, as well as some elements of Baroque. His pictorial compositions are simply the results of his imagination without any cinematographic aids, using principally the oil canvas technique called “alla prima”, keen to the original impressionist painters, which cancels the initial undercoated and glazed steps.

Biography After years of touring clubs around Europe, Norwegian/English psychedelic outfit Lonely Crowd started making their mark on the radio and even the charts in 2008, with the single \\"Aren't You Forgetting Something?\\". With the three hit singles they have had since, they look set to beat Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" in terms of Norwegian hits, when the follow-up to their 2007 debut album, Watching From A Distance, is released. The album The Not-So-Great Britain was due in October 2012. Lonely Crowd has existed in different forms since 1995, when singer Stig Jakobsen left the wildly eccentric Vampire State Building and immediately formed the band, with former members of De Press and Holy Toy. Full of self-confidence, they brought the Mega Records boss to their first gig, and were signed right away, more because of the phenomenal after- party than their live performance. (The party resulted in the band being forbidden to play in Tromsø ever again). Lonely Crowd released three EPs on Mega, the second of which (Jesus In The Pub) became a radio hit in Norway, and was given rave reviews (six out of six in both Dagbladet and Panorama). The song featured the opera singer Anne-Lise Berntsen, and later became a mini-hit on XFM in London. Lonely Crowd moved to London before Mega Records released their debut album. Here they set up a studio, and recorded and toured constantly for the next four years. Three of the original members were replaced by a Norwegian guitarist, Marius Gengenbach, and an English rhythm section consisting of double bass player Floyd Jensen and drummer James Corner (formerly of Back To The Planet and Barry Adamson). Having made a bit of a name for themselves in England, Lonely Crowd were booked on a European tour and later played support to the Fun Lovin' Criminals at their London concert. The band was in the middle of negotiations with one of the larger indie labels in the UK when Jensen died from a sugar coma. The album material, however, was already completed, and most of this will be appearing on The End of the Roadie album. An acoustic lineup of Lonely Crowd (with cello player Eirik Roald, Stine Varvin (formerly of Vampire State Building) on vocals and Stig Jakobsen on guitar/vocals) went on a Swiss tour, an England tour and played several shows in Norway during 2008-2009. Lonely Crowd signed a two-album deal with Karisma Records, and release the three first EPs (plus two new tracks) as an album in November 2007, under the name Watching From a Distance. In July 2008 Lonely Crowd experienced their first summer hit, as they spent five weeks in the Norwegian Charts with the single \\"Aren't You Forgetting Something?\\". The release contained the first two songs from The Not So Great Britain album (that was eventually released in November 2012). The feat was repeated in August 2009, when the \\"She's Not Afraid\\" single reached number 18 in the Norwegian Chart. In May 2010, Lonely Crowd reached their highest position to this date, when \\"Cosmologies In The Making\\" made it to No. 12. They also managed two weeks in the Norwegian chart in the summer of 2011, with a single featuring the Norwegian rapper Vinni of Paperboys - \\"In The Eyes Of The World\\", and reached No. 3 in the Billboard Norway Digital Song Chart in March 2013 with \\"Golden Opportunity\\". Lonely Crowd have also collaborated with David Bowie guitarist Kevin Armstrong and footballer-cum-actor Vinnie Jones.

Founding members were Mike Brown, Ross Crothall, and Colin Lanceley. They staged exhibitions in Sydney's Rudy Komon Gallery and John Reed's Museum of Modern Art and Design in Melbourne. Andrew Sayers, former head of Australia's National Portrait Gallery, described their work as \\"chaotic, exubrent, and profuse—collaborative collages consisting of junk and plastic objects, doodle- like drawings, and paintings celebrating a bizarre cast of characters.\\" According to Lanceley, Imitation Realism was largely a reaction against what the members perceived as the \\"conservatism and lack of guts\\" of the Sydney art world.Art Nation: Colin Lanceley, abc.net.au. Retrieved on 26 January 2011. The group dissolved in 1964. History Ross Crothall (1934–), Colin Lanceley (1934–2015) and Mike Brown (1938–1997) met through East Sydney Technical College in 1956, but by 1958 only Lanceley remained at the college, where he later studied painting under renowned Australian abstract artist John Olsen. The three, along with a group of their classmates, had experimented with collaborative art making practices and avant-garde forms of art. Gradually their interests began to diversify into other fields such as assemblage, collage, \\"junk art\\", and non-Western art, especially Indigenous Australian art and the body ornaments and tribal house decorations of New Guinea. They collected scraps and debris in the streets of Sydney and in junk yards, infusing their art with a sense of urban larrikinism. By 1960, Crothall and Brown were living together in a house Crothall had rented in Annandale and Lanceley was a frequent visitor. They mounted their first exhibition in February 1962 at the Melbourne Museum of Modern Art and Design, and their second and final exhibition in May 1962 at the Rudy Komon Gallery in Sydney. Robert Hughes thought their work owes more to \\"folk art incrustation\\" than high art, and recognized the influence of Sepik art: \\"In the early 1960s the Sydney artworld was saturated in Melanesian art, particularly from the Sepik. One could not be unfamiliar with it.\\" Many had difficulty classifying the works of the Annandale Imitation Realists. According to art historian Christopher Heathcote, \\"There was confusion over what to call the 'Imitation Realism'. What was this style? Several writers opted for pop art, yet the works resembled neither the European nor American varieties of pop. .... Imitation Realism represented a complete disregard for accepted artistic values.\\" Comparisons were also drawn to Dadaism and the \\"anti-art\\" of Marcel Duchamp, primitive art and children's drawings. Mike Brown noted that at different times their work was called \\"modern reliquary, satirical goonery, and inspired or uninspired doodling,.... It has also been said to comprise a new Art Movement. God forbid.\\" The group ended in 1964 when Lanceley departed for Europe. He returned to Sydney in 1981, at which stage significant works of the Annandale Imitation Realists were represented in all major galleries in Australia. Lanceley's 1961 work Glad Family Picnic is considered a masterpiece of the movement, and is deemed a collection highlight at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.Art Gallery of New South Wales.

It both reflected and encouraged the 18th century establishment of Birmingham as the political hub of the surrounding region, seeking to accommodate the political implications of the development of Birmingham within the framework of the 18th century constitution. By the end of the century the club was described as including \\"representatives of the Magnates of the County, the Gentlemen and Tradespeople of the town, the Clergy and the officers from the Barracks, and the principal representative actors from the local theatre\\". In a town with a tradition of Radicalism and an influential Nonconformist minority, the Bean Club was strongly Tory and exclusively Anglican. No Dissenter was ever admitted, and its membership excluded not just influential local Whig aristocrats such as the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of Conway and Lord Archer, but also more moderate Tories such as the Earl of Aylesford, and influential conservative Birmingham Anglicans who were closely associated with Dissenters, such as Matthew Boulton and Samuel Garbett. Re-established The club was re-established in May 1749 and quickly built up a national importance. Its leading figures – Lord Craven, Lord Leigh and, from the mid-1750s, the Earl of Denbigh – effectively controlled the selection of Members of Parliament for Warwickshire during the early and mid 18th century. The 1750s and 1760s were difficult times for Toryism nationwide, however, and the club's fortunes reflected this. Meetings were cut back from weekly to monthly in 1753, and in 1759 they were further reduced to annual occasions. This era also saw strained relations between the Birmingham and country members: only 42 of the 387 members in 1755 were from Birmingham and there is evidence of tension between the groups. Most notably, no attempt was made to elect Samuel Aris when he succeeded his father Thomas Aris as editor of the conservative Birmingham Gazette in 1761. The Bean Club was reinvigorated after the dramatic election of Thomas Skipwith – a disaffected Bean Club member – to one of the Warwickshire county seats with the votes of the Birmingham freeholders in 1769, as Birmingham's electoral influence was made clear and the leading county Tories made renewed efforts to reach an accommodation with the town. 56 new members were elected to the club between 1770 and 1773 – more than during the entire previous decade – and 36 of these came from Birmingham, including Samuel Aris in 1770. The frequency of meetings was increased to quarterly in 1771. The club's members became increasingly influential in the government of the town over the following decades – eight members of the Street Commissioners elected in 1769 were Bean Club members, as were seven of the committee of the Birmingham General Hospital in 1765, and members were prominent among the subscribers to Birmingham's Anglican Sunday Schools. The club also took a leading role in the establishment of the \\"Birmingham interest\\" as a force in regional politics after 1774. All of the Members of Parliament for Warwickshire elected between 1769 and 1782 on the back of the strength of the Birmingham freeholders' vote were County Stewards of the Bean Club – Skipwith, Sir Charles Holte, Sir George Shuckburgh and Robert Lawley. Neither were the Bean Club's interests were not confined to Warwickshire. Edward Foley and William Lygon, both Members of Parliament for Worcestershire, served as county stewards in 1784, by which time members lived as far away as Bridgnorth in Shropshire, Stone and Burton on Trent in Staffordshire, Stoke in Herefordshire, Malvern in Worcestershire, Appleby in Leicestershire and Daventry in Northamptonshire. Although the society claimed in 1769 to be \\"ever devoted to the support of Liberty and Independence\\", the opinions of members were split over the American War of Independence, and adopted an increasingly conservative outlook over the course of the 1770s. By the 1790s Bean Club members were closely involved in the formation of loyalist associations in the wake of the Priestley riots, such as the Birmingham Church and King Club founded in 1792.

In this respect some of the group members and their respective institutes have recently entered into a collaboration agreement with the Italian pharmaceutical company Dompé based in L’Aquila, central Italy with the intention of developing one of the RICG produced recombinant immunotoxins for investigation in early phase clinical trials for patients with leukaemia and lymphoma.

Claeissins (1500–1576) was a Flemish painter of history paintings, portraits and allegorical scenes.Pieter Claeissens (I) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was the first prominent artist in an extended family of artists from Bruges.Alexandra Zvereva, Gillis Claeissens Portrait of Joris Van Brakele, Lord of Courtebois, Hautrive and Moorslede, Jean-Luc Baroni Life Pieter Claeissens the Elder was born in Bruges as the son of Alard Claeissens who was also a painter. He was registered as a pupil of Adriaan Bekaert at the Guild of St. Luke of Bruges in 1516. He was admitted as a master in 1530 and was dean of the Guild in 1572.Gwendoline Denhaene, Pieter Claeissens (I), in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges He married Marie Meese. Of their five sons, the four youngest would become artists: Gillis, Pieter and Antoon became painters while Ambrosius became a master goldsmith. The visitation Is it possible for Claeissens to cooperate with Benson in the period that he is fully aged from around 1520 to his mastery in 1530? In any case, it could explain the share of Pieter I Claeissens in the Spanish export market of works of art, where Benson is the leading artist. Pieter Claeissens the Elder died in Bruges in 1576. Work Pieter Claeissens the Elder painted history paintings, portraits and allegorical scenes. The attributions of work to the artist have traditionally been difficult because of the lack of signed works. Only in 2003 was it proven that works signed 'Petrus Nicolai Moraulus' were actually by the hand of Pieter Claeissens the Elder. Five works that carried this signature had earlier been regarded as being by another painter because of the conservative style in which they were executed. The generally accepted view was that Pieter Claeissens would have worked in a more progressive style. The study of four of the five signed panels (the fifth painting has not been seen since 1951) has enabled art historians to form a coherent image of the painting technique and composition style of the artist. Research with infrared reflectography of two of his paintings allowed the study of the underdrawing by the artist and support certain attributions to the artist. The complex situation of various family members working in the same workshop has created additional problems of attribution of works to individual family members.Anne van Oosterwijk, Tentoonstelling Pieter Pourbus en de vergeten meesters Christ on the cross with Mary, John and Mary Magdalene Recently a number of works attributed to Pieter the Elders have been re-attributed to his son Gillis. This includes a triptych painted for Claeys van de Kerchove and his family as an epitaph for the family tomb in the church of St Catherine in Assebroek. The panels of the triptych executed in 1576 are now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, where they are still attributed to Pieter Claeissens the Elder. Among recent attributions to Pieter Claeissens the Elder are a number of works that were formerly attributed to Ambrosius Benson such as, for example, the Holy Ursula (Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias). The kinship in a number of stylistic features between Claeissens and Benson and the resulting confusion between their oeuvres has given rise to the hypothesis that Pieter may have worked in the Benson workshop from 1520 to 1530 when he became a master in his own right. The Claeissens workshop produced works in which the influence of the painters Adriaen Isenbrandt and Ambrosius Benson who were active in Bruges as well as the modernizing tendencies of the Pieter Pourbus are transformed into a personal style. The figures and compositions are designed according to stereotyped and repetitive patterns that were successful in Bruges.

It is mostly composed of iron, oxygen, silicon, zirconium and titanium with smaller fractions of yttrium and calcium. It is named after the Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility), the place on the Moon from which the rock samples in which it was found were brought during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. It was the last mineral brought from the Moon which was thought to be unique, with no counterpart on Earth, until it was discovered in Australia in 2011. Discovery In 1970, material scientists found a new unnamed Fe, Ti, Zr- silicate mineral containing rare-earths and Y in lunar rock sample 10047. The first detailed analysis of the mineral was published in 1971 and the name \\"tranquillityite\\" was proposed and later accepted by the International Mineralogical Association. It was later found in lunar rock samples from all Apollo missions. Samples were dated by Pb/Pb ion probe techniques. Together with armalcolite and pyroxferroite, it is one of the three minerals which were first discovered on the Moon, before terrestrial occurrences were found.Lunar Sample Mineralogy, NASA Fragments of tranquillityite were later found in Northwest Africa, in the NWA 856 Martian meteorite. Terrestrial occurrences of tranquillityite have been found in six localities in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, in 2011. The Australian occurrences include a number of Proterozoic to Cambrian age diabase and gabbro dikes and sills. It occurs as interstitial grains with zirconolite, baddeleyite, and apatite associated with late stage intergrowths of quartz and feldspar. Properties Tranquillityite forms thin stripes up to 15 by 65 micrometres in size in basaltic rocks, where it was produced at a late crystallization stage. It is associated with troilite, pyroxferroite, cristobalite and alkali feldspar. The mineral is nearly opaque and appears dark red-brown in thin crystals. The analyzed samples contain less than 10% impurities (Y, Al, Mn, Cr, Nb and other rare- earth element) and up to 0.01% (100 ppm) of uranium. Presence of a significant amount of uranium allowed scientists to estimate the age of tranquillityite and some associated minerals in Apollo 11 samples as 3710 million years using the uranium-lead dating technique. Irradiation by alpha particles generated by uranium decay is believed to be the origin of the predominantly amorphous metamict structure of tranquillityite. Its crystals were obtained by annealing the samples at for 30 minutes. Longer annealing did not improve the crystalline quality, and annealing at higher temperatures resulted in spontaneous fracture of samples. The crystals were initially found to have a hexagonal crystal structure with the lattice parameters, a = 1.169 nm, c = 2.225 nm and three formula units per unit cell, but later reassigned a face- centered cubic structure (fluorite-like). A tranquillityite-like crystalline phase has been synthesized by mixing oxide powders in an appropriate ratio, determined from the chemical analysis of the lunar samples, and annealing the mixture at . This phase was not pure, but intergrown with various intermetallic compounds.

It is located northwest of Klamath, California. It was closed in 1981. History Klamath Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to quicken construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to begin constructionWinkler & Webster, p. 22 adjacent to the town of Requa, California, about 3 miles northwest of the town of Klamath and within sight of the mouth of the Klamath River. The 777th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was activated at the new station on 18 December 1950. The station initially was a \\"Lashup-Permanent\\" site (LP-33), operating an AN/TPS-1B radar. It joined the Permanent radar network, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. From April 1952, the 777th AC&W; Sq operated AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars at the station. An AN/GPS-3 radar was added to it in 1956. The AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 were replaced by AN/FPS-20 and AN/FPS-6 radars by 1958. During the following year, the station added an AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar, which was later modified to an AN/FPS-90, while the AN/GPS-3 was removed.Winkler & Webster, p. 102 During 1960, Klamath AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-13 at Adair AFS, Oregon. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 777th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1960.Cornett & Johnson, p. 167 The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By the end of 1961, the AN/FPS-20A long-range search radar had been upgraded and re-designated as an AN/FPS-66. An AN/FPS-26 frequency diversity height-finder radar was added during 1962. On 31 July 1963, the site was re-designated as NORAD ID Z-33. By 1966 there was an AN/FPS-27 long-range search radar in operation there, and the AN/FPS-66 was subsequently retired. In addition to the main facility, Klamath personnel operated one AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Capetown, CA (P-33A) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1979, Klamath came under Tactical Air Command (TAC) jurisdiction with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the creation of ADTAC. The 777th Radar Sq was inactivated on 30 September 1981, and the property was turned over to the National Park Service except for about 2 acres which were given to the Federal Aviation Administration, who continued operations of the AN/FPS-66A search radar in the old AN/FPS-27 tower. FAA operations later ceased as well and the Klamath California radar site coverage volume was taken over by the FAA/USAF joint use site at Rainbow Ridge, CA (J-83A), operating an ARSR-4. After military use ceased, the site's residential housing area was used by the California Conservation Corps while the remainder of the site (other than the FAA property) became a maintenance facility for Redwood National Park. Following the opening of the park's North Operations Center near Crescent City, California in 2009, the NPS began work to remove nearly all remaining buildings and infrastructure, to return the site to a more natural state. As of 2012, all former Air Force, FAA and NPS facilities had been removed, with only some cellular telecommunications equipment remaining at the site.

When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD, Skupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople.

After 1018, it was a capital of Byzantine theme of Bulgaria after the fall the First Bulgarian Empire. In 1189 the town was part of the Serbian realm later becoming the capital of the Serbian Empire. In 1392 the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and they named the town Üsküb. The town stayed under Ottoman rule for over 500 years. During that period it was famous for its oriental architecture. In 1913, after the Balkan Wars, Skopje became part of Kingdom of Serbia, and after the First World War the city became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of Yugoslavia). In the Second World War the city was conquered by the Bulgarian Army, which was collaborating with the Nazi Germans.

The city developed rapidly after World War II, but this trend was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a disastrous earthquake. In 1991 it became the capital centre of independent Macedonia. Skopje was the birthplace of the noted missionary Religious Sister, Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Early phase Scupi was quickly gained by the Romans and remains faithful to the decline of the Empire. The site of modern Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC by the local Pelasgian tribes.; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale fortress that overlooks the modern city centre. The earliest people in Skopje Valley were probably the Triballi, a Thracian tribe that received influences from Celts, Scythians and Illyrians. Later the area was populated by the Paionians, but in the 3rd century BC, Skopje and the surrounding area was invaded by the Dardanians. Scupi, the ancient name for Skopje, became the capital of Dardania, which extended from Naissus to Bylazora in the second century BC. Roman expansion east brought Skupi under Roman rule on the eve of the 1st century AD, but several legions from the Roman province of Macedonia from the Crassus' army of 29-28 BC, may already have been stationed there, before the official imperial command in this area was instituted.The Cambridge Ancient History, John Boardman, Volume 13 of The Cambridge Ancient History, Author Averil Cameron, Contributor R.

Most probably Scupi was founded as war camp, which became a town with a status of colony. The northward expansion of the empire in the course of the 1st century BC lead to the creation of the province of Moesia in Augustus's times, into which Scupi was incorporated. After the division of the province by Domitian in 86 AD, Scupi was elevated to colonia status, and became a seat of government within the new province of Moesia superior. The district called Dardania (in Moesia Superior), was formed into a special province by Diocletian, with the capital at Naissus. From 395 AD, it passed into the hands of the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Empire. The first known bishop of the city is Perigorius, present at the Council of Sardica (343). Scupi was probably a metropolitan see about the middle of the 5th century ().Catholic Encyclopedia: Scopia. Medieval era Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD, Skupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople and became an important trading and garrison town for the region. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian (527–65 AD) was born in Tauresium (about 20 km southeast of present-day Skopje) in 483 AD, and after Skupi was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake in 518 AD. Justinian built a new town at the fertile entry point of the River Lepenec into the Vardar. Some historians believe this might be the city of Justiniana Prima. During much of the early medieval period, the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire. From 972 to 992 it was the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire. It was a capital of Byzantine administrative region (katepanat) Bulgaria after the fall the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018. Skopje was a thriving trading settlement but fell into decline after being hit by another devastating earthquake at the end of the 11th century. In 1189 the town was part of the Serbian realm. It was a capital of the estate of the Bulgarian feudal lord, later Emperor Konstantin Asen in the middle of the 13th century. The Byzantine Empire took advantage of the decline in Skopje to regain influence in the area, but lost control of it once again in 1282 to King Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia. Milutin's grandson, Stefan Dušan, made Skopje his capital, from which he was proclaimed Tsar in 1346, subsequently making it the capital of the Serbian Empire. After his sudden death in 1355, he was succeeded by Stephen Uroš V of Serbia who could not keep Serbian Empire together and it was fragmented in many small principalities with Vuk Branković last Serbian and Christian prince that had Skopje under control during medieval period until it fell under Ottoman Control in 1392, for the next 520 years. Ottoman era Ishak Bey Mosque. Rolling back Byzantine rule across much of the Balkans, the Ottoman Turks finally conquered Skopje in 1392 beginning a 520 years period of Ottoman rule. The Ottomans pronounced the town Üsküb and named it as such. At first the Ottomans divided the greater Macedonian region into three vilayets, or districts — Üsküb (Kosovo), Manastir and Selanik – and as the northernmost of these, Üsküb was strategically important for further forays into central Europe. Under Ottoman rule the town moved further towards the entry point of the River Serava into the Vardar. Also the architecture of the town was changed accordingly. During the 15th century, many travelers' inns were established in the town, such as Kapan An and Suli An, which still exist today. The city's famous Stone Bridge (Kameni Most) – was also reconstructed during this period and the famous Daud Pasha baths (now a modern art gallery) was built at the end of the 15th century. At this time numerous Spanish Sephardic Jews driven out of Spain settled in Üsküb, adding to the cultural mix of the town and enhancing the town's trading reputation. At the beginning of Ottoman rule, several mosques sprang up in the city, and church lands were often seized and given to ex-soldiers, while many churches themselves were converted over time into mosques. The most impressive mosques erected during this early period include the Sultan Murat or Hjunkar Mosque, Aladza Mosque and the Mustafa Pasha Mosque. In 1555, another earthquake hit the town, destroying much of the centre. The outskirts survived and the town continued, nonetheless, to prosper with traders and travelers. Travel reports from the era number Üsküb's population anywhere between 30,000 and 60,000 inhabitants. Üsküb was briefly occupied in 1689 by the Austrian General Piccolomini. He and his troops did not stay for long, however, as the town was quickly engulfed by the plague. On retreating from the town Piceolomini's troops set fire to Üsküb, perhaps in order to stamp out the plague, although some say this was done in order to avenge the 1683 Ottoman siege of Vienna. For the next two centuries Üsküb's prestige waned and by the 19th century its population had dwindled to a mere 10,000. In 1873, however, the completion of the Üsküb—Selanik (now Skopje—Thessaloniki) railway brought many more travellers and traders to the town, so that by around the start of the 20th century Üsküb had regained its former numbers of around 30,000. Towards the end of the Ottoman Empire, Üsküb, along with other towns in Macedonia – Krusevo and Manastir (now Bitola) – became main hubs of rebellious movements against Ottoman rule. Üsküb was a key player in the Ilinden Uprising of August 1903 when the native population of the region declared the emergence of the Krusevo Republic. While the Krusevo Republic lasted only ten days before being quelled by the Ottomans, it was a sign of the beginning of the end for Ottoman rule. After 500 years of rule in the area the Ottomans were finally ousted in 1912 by the Serbian army during the first Balkan War. Balkan and World Wars Albanian irregulars at Skopje's train station after capturing the city in August 1912 Change of city name from Üsküb to Skoplje in 1912. As the administrative centre of the region, Üsküb also administered the vilayet of Kossovo under Ottoman rule. This did not go down well with the increasingly Albanian population of Kosovo who preferred to be ruled by Albanians rather than the Turks (whereas Kosovo Serbs, similar in demographics to the Kosovo Albanians at the time, sought to join the Kingdom of SerbiaServia by the Servians, Compiled and Edited by Alfred Stead, With a Map, London (William Heinemann), 1909.

During the Albanian revolt of 1912, the Ottomans were shortly expelled from the city during August 12–15, 1912 by the local Albanian population when 15,000 Albanians marched on and captured Üsküb.Jelavich, Barbara (1983) History of the Balkans: Twentieth Century (volume 2 of History of the Balkans) Cambridge University Press, New York, page 89, The Turks, already weak from other battles against the united front of Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria during the First Balkan War, started to flee. When reinforcements to the Serbian royal army arrived some weeks later during the Battle of Kumanovo (50 km northeast of Skopje) it proved decisive in firmly driving out the Ottomans from all of Macedonia.

The losses from the quake amounted to a massive 150% of Macedonia's GNP at the time and 15% of Yugoslavia's GNP. A major international relief effort saw the city rebuilt quickly, though much of its old neo-classical charm was lost in the process. The new master plan of the city was created by the then leading Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The ruins of the old Skopje train station which was destroyed in the earthquake remain today as a memorial to the victims along with an adjacent museum. Nearly all of the city's beautiful neo-classical 18th and 19th century buildings were destroyed in the earthquake, including the National Theater and many government buildings, as well as most of the Kale Fortress. International financial aid poured into Skopje in order to help rebuild the city. As a result, came the many modern (at the time) brutalist structures of the 1960s, that can still be seen today , such as the central post office building and the National Bank, as well as hundreds of now abandoned caravans and prefabricated mobile homes. Fortunately, though, as with previous earthquakes, much of the old Turkish side of town survived. Independence Highrises in modern Skopje. Skopje made the transition easily from the capital of the Socialist Federal Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the capital of today's Republic of Macedonia. The city livened up considerably when Skopje housed the headquarters of the NATO intervention into Kosovo in 1998 and 1999. The city saw some rioting during 2001 when internal conflict between the Albanian community and the Macedonian majority erupted over lack of Albanian representation in government and other social institutions. Today, Skopje is seeing a makeover in buildings, streets and shops. The new VMRO–DPMNE government elected in July 2006 has pledged to restore the Kale fortress and to rebuild the beautiful 19th century Army House, the Old National Theatre, and the Old National Bank of Macedonia – all destroyed in the 1963 earthquake. Other projects under construction are the \\"Macedonian Struggle\\" Museum, the Archeological Museum of Macedonia, National Archive of Macedonia, Constitutional Court, and a new Philharmonic Theater.

Narcissistic mortification is a term first used by Sigmund Freud in his last book, Moses and Monotheism,Sigmund Freud, Moses and Monotheism (Standard Ed., 23) p. 74 and p. 76 with respect to early injuries to the ego/self. The concept has been widely employed in ego psychology and also contributed to the roots of self psychology. When narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. This produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic libido (also known as ego-libido) or destrudo is built up. 1957;31(4):657-68. Narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. Destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself. Early developments: Bergler, Anna Freud, and Eidelberg Edmund Bergler developed the concept of narcissistic mortification in connection with early fantasies of omnipotence in the developing child, and with the fury provoked by the confrontations with reality that undermine his or her illusions.Edmund Bergler, \\"The Psychology of Gambling\\", Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., The Psychology of Gambling (London 1974) p. 182-3 For Bergler, “the narcissistic mortification suffered in this very early period continues to act as a stimulus throughout his life”.Edmund Bergler, The Basic Neurosis (1975) Anna Freud used the term in connection with her exploration of the defence mechanism of altruistic surrender, whereby an individual lives only through the lives of others – seeing at the root of such an abrogation of one's own life an early experience of narcissistic mortification at a disappointment with one's self.Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, Freud's Women (2004) p. 294 Psychoanalyst and author Ludwig Eidelberg subsequently expanded on the concept in the fifties and sixties. Eidelberg defined narcissistic mortification as occurring when “a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality...produces the painful emotional experience of terror”.\\"An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification\\" Psychiatric Quarterly 31 He also stressed that for many patients simply to have to accept themselves as having neurotic symptoms was itself a source of narcissistic mortification.Eidelberg: The Concept of Narcissistic Mortification Int J Psychoanal. 1959 May-Aug;40:163-8. Kohut and self psychology For Kohut, narcissistic injury - the root cause of what he termed narcissistic personality disorder – was broadly equivalent to the humiliation of mortification.Joseph Adamson/Hilary Anne Clark, Scenes of Shame (1999) p. 21 Kohut considered that “if the grandiosity of the narcissistic self has been insufficiently modified...then the adult ego will tend to vacillate between an irrational overestimation of the self and feelings of inferiority and will react with narcissistic mortification to the thwarting of its ambitions”.Quoted in Steven J. Ellman, When Theories Touch (London 2009) p. 464 Object relations theory Unlike ego psychologists, object relations theorists have traditionally used a rather different, post-Kleinian vocabulary to describe the early woundings of narcissistic mortification. Recently however such theorists have found analogies between Freud's emphasis on the sensitivity of the ego to narcissistic humiliation and mortification, and the views of Bion on 'nameless dread' or Winnicott's on the original agonies of the breakdown of childhood consciousness.Michael Eigen, The Sensitive Self (2004) p. 10, 20, and 25 At the same time ego psychologists have been increasingly prepared to see narcissistic mortification as occurring in the context of early relations to objects. Physical sensations and psychological perceptions An individual’s experience of mortification may be accompanied by both physical and psychological sensations. Physical sensations such as: burning, painful tingling over the body, pain in the chest that slowly expands and spreads throughout the torso, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, blanching, coldness and numbness can be experienced by the individual suffering from mortification. The psychological sensations described are feeling shocked, exposed, and humiliated. Descriptions of this experience can be, for example: “It feels like I won’t survive” and “I have the absolute conviction that he or she hates me and it’s my fault”. These sensations are always followed by shock, although they may have happened on various occasions, they also prompt the need for the individual suffering to do something both internally and externally, to effect a positive self-image in the eyes of their narcissistic object. Narcissistic mortification is extreme in its intensity, global nature, and its lack of perspective, causing the anxiety associated with it to become traumatic. Normal versus pathological In Eidelberg's view, a normal individual would usually be able to avoid being overwhelmed by internal needs because they recognize these urges in time to bring about their partial discharge. However, Eidelberg does not view occasional outbursts of temper as a sign of disorder. An individual experiencing pathological narcissistic mortification is prone to become fixated on infantile objects, resulting in an infantile form of discharge. He or she cannot be satisfied by the partial discharge of this energy, which takes place on an unconscious level, and this in turn interferes with their well-being. According to Eidelberg, the denial of an infantile narcissistic mortification can be responsible for many defensive mechanisms. =Internal versus external= Narcissistic mortification can be: * Internal - occurs when an individual is overstimulated by their emotions. For example, while debating with classmates on the importance of stem cell research an outspoken student loses his temper causing an uproar. The student has just exhibited an overstimulation of his emotions and used this outburst to relieve internal tension. * External - occurs when something out of one's control influences a situation, for example, an individual who is held at gunpoint while having their wallet stolen. This individual does not hold any control over the scenario nor the actions of the gunman, but their reaction to being held at gunpoint influences the next scenario and what the gunman does next. In cult leadership To escape the narcissistic mortification of accepting their own dependency needs, cult leaders may resort to delusions of omnipotence. Their continuing shame and underlying guilt, and their repudiation of dependency, obliges such leaders to use seduction and manic defenses to externalize and locate dependency needs in others, thus making their followers controllable through a displaced sense of shame. Death, anxiety, and suicide Because in Western culture death is sometimes seen as the ultimate loss of control, fear of it may produce death anxiety in the form of a sense of extreme shame or narcissistic mortification.J. Kauffman ed., The Shame of Death, Grief and Trauma (2010) p. 77-9 The shame in this context is produced by the loss of stoicism, productivity, and control, aspects that are highly valued by society and aspects that are taken away as one ages. Death according to Darcy Harris, 'is the ultimate narcissistic wound, bringing about not just the annihilation of self, but the annihilation of one's entire existence, resulting in a form of existential shame for human beings, who possess the ability to ponder this dilemma with their higher functioning cognitive abilities.'Kauffman Individuals who hold this anxiety are ashamed of mortality and the frailty that comes along with it; and may attempt to overcome this reality through diversions and accomplishments, deflecting feelings of inferiority and shame through strategies like grandiosity in similar fashion to those with narcissistic personality traits. Narcissistic mortification may also be produced by death of someone close.Arnold M. Cooper ed., Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America (2008) p. 680 Such a loss of an essential object may even lead through narcissistic mortification to suicide.F. Alexander et al, Psychoanalytic Pioneers (1995) p. 207 Among the many motives behind suicidal activities in general are shame, loss of honor, and narcissistic mortification. Those who suffer from narcissistic mortification are more likely to participate in suicidal behaviors and those who do not receive the proper help more often than not succeed. Suicide related to narcissistic mortification is different from normal sorrow in that it is associated with deep rooted self-contempt and self-hatred.Woolf, M. M. (1958). Zur Psychologie des Selbstmordes. Acta Psychotherapeutica, Psychosomatica Et Orthopaedagogica, 6317-326. doi:10.1159/000285354 Treatment According to a paper presented by Mary Libbey, \\"On Narcissistic Mortification\\", presented at the 2006 Shame Symposium, long-term goal of psychoanalytic treatment for those who suffer from narcissistic mortification is to transform the mortification into shame. She says by transforming it into shame it enables the sufferer to tolerate and use it as a signal; the process of transforming mortification into shame entails working through both the early mortifying traumas as well as the defenses, often unstable, related to them. If an individual sufferer does not go through this transformation, he or she is left with two unstable narcissistic defenses. Libbey says these defenses are: self-damning, deflated states designed to appease and hold on to self-objects, and narcissistic conceit, which is designed to project the defective self experiences onto self-objects. Both of these defensive styles require a continuation of dependence on the self-object. Transforming the mortification into shame makes it possible for self-appraisal and self-tolerance, this ultimately leads to psychic separation and self-reliance without the need to sustain one's mortification, according to Libbey's paper. In the 21st century Postmodern Freudians link narcissistic mortification to Winnicott's theory of primitive mental states which lack the capacity for symbolisation, and their need for re-integration.A.

Viewed from a specific position, the fragments come together to form complete images. If the observer moves, the anamorphic illusions come apart again and the image becomes abstract.\\"Nach der Gesellschaft\\", Manfred Fassler, , Willhelm Fink-Verlag, page 167 A heavy emphasis is placed on the Gesamtkunstwerk aspect of the works, rather than individual images.

The pair write and record melodic songs that range from psychedelic pop to stream-of-consciousness folk and play an array of predominantly acoustic instruments as a backdrop to their blend of vocal harmonies. Biography Martin Welham was part of the influential 1960's acid folk trio Forest. In the early 2000s, thirty years after Forest disbanded, he formed Somerset based band The Story with his son Tom and returned to recording music. The duo's sound has echoes of Martin's earlier work\\"Citizens Arcane\\", Shindig, Vol 2 (May - June 2008):32 with authentic psychedelic songwriting at its core. The band's first release was a 2005 vinyl split album, The Dawn Is Crowned, with Californian freak folk band Whysp on Good Village Records. The Story's side features five broadly acoustic tracks that blend esoteric, dark imagery with powerful vocal harmonies resulting in an un-attributable psychedelic air. In 2006 the band released their first full-length album Tale Spin on Sunbeam Records - the first contemporary artists released by the label. This psychedelic folk album features acoustic guitars, keyboards and light percussion combined with airy harmony vocals and wistful melodies. Follow-up album Arcane Rising was released in 2007. A stream of consciousness conceptual song cycle, the album is made up of improvised melodies and acoustic guitar backings augmented by flutes, melody harp, harmonica and hand percussion. Lyrically the album celebrates life and nature through the changing seasons whilst questioning religious doctrines and humankind's ecological footprint.\\"The Story Arcane Rising Review\\", Shindig, Vol 2 (May - June 2008):59 Also in 2007, The Story's sinister track \\"The Wicker Man\\" featured on the dark folk compilation album John Barleycorn Reborn on Cold Spring Records.

It explores the differences between French and American cultural values through a story about a veteran cartoonist who encounters conflicting reactions to his work during a trip abroad. Plot Joey Wellman, an American cartoonist from Cleveland now largely forgotten at home, visits France with his partner Lena to attend an exhibition in Paris about the comic strip (bande dessinée) which features his work. He also hopes to be reconciled with his daughter Elsie who has been a student in Paris for two years, in flight from the American culture of which she sees her father as a typical example. Elsie is naively infatuated with French literature, and is trying to secure an introduction to the brilliant university professor Christian Gauthier, an expert on Flaubert but also an enthusiast for comic books. The meeting of father and daughter goes badly, but Elsie is persuaded to join Joey and Lena for the weekend at the country house of Gauthier's mother, Isabelle. During a comic-themed masquerade party, all of the characters are made to reconsider their present and past relationships. Cast * Adolph Green, as Joey Wellman * Gérard Depardieu, as Christian Gauthier * Micheline Presle, as Isabelle Gauthier, Christian's mother * Linda Lavin, as Lena Apthrop, Joey's partner * Laura Benson, as Elsie Wellman, Joey's daughter * John Ashton, as Harry Dempsey, an American film director in exile * Geraldine Chaplin, as Terry Armstrong * Françoise Bertin, as The greengrocer's client Production The project initially arose from Resnais's admiration for the plays of the American writer and illustrator Jules Feiffer. Although there was originally no intention of highlighting the comic-strip, Feiffer suggested using the character of a comic illustrator as the means of exploring American and French attitudes towards the appreciation of cartoons and comic-books. This appealed to Resnais's own longstanding enthusiasm for comic-strips, and allowed him to develop a film that was dense with references to cartoon characters and their creators. (Animated characters often appear within the frame to converse with one of the live-actors.) Resnais was also fascinated by the question of whether people could appreciate comics on the same level as a literary work such as one by Flaubert.Interview with Alain Resnais, by Serge Toubiana in October 2002, included in the DVD edition of I Want to Go Home by Artificial Eye (2010). Another source of reference was American musical comedy, underlined by the casting in the central role of Adolph Green, writer of classic musicals such as On the Town, Singin' in the Rain, and The Band Wagon, and by the choice of John Kander, composer of Cabaret and Chicago, to provide the musical score. The film was made predominantly in English. A dubbed French version was subsequently created (without Resnais's participation).Editorial note in: Alain Masson, \\"Riant avec leurs amis\\", in Alain Resnais: anthologie établie par Stéphane Goudet. (Paris: Positif, Gallimard, 2002.) p.378. Reception On its release the film met with a largely hostile reception from both critics and the public in France. Resnais attributed the film's failure to the unfamiliarity of the public with the world of the comic-strip and its personalities, which made it difficult to appreciate the confrontation of values which the film explored.The film received a rare sympathetic review in Cahiers du Cinéma, where it was included among their ten best films of 1989. The film failed to get distribution either in the United States or in Great Britain. Variety described it as a \\"stillborn satiric comedy\\".Variety, 31 December 1988. [retrieved 25 January 2011] The producer of the film, Marin Karmitz, registered a substantial financial loss from the film's commercial flop, and was unable to engage in further production work for the next 18 months. He nevertheless continued to declare his support for what he regarded as one of Resnais's most important films, describing it as \\"a great film about death, and about the death of certain cultures\\".Interview with Marin Karmitz (2002), included in the DVD edition of I Want to Go Home by Artificial Eye (2010). I Want to Go Home was shown at the 1989 Venice Film Festival, where it won awards for Alain Resnais and Jules Feiffer. The appearance of the film on DVD two decades after its original release led to some more sympathetic assessments, and recognition of its \\"blatantly nutty\\" humour.Review of several Resnais films by David Ehrenstein for DVDBeaver.

He had the title of čelnik (\\"head\\"), and governed Upper Zeta. He is an ancestor of the Crnojević noble family (a branch of the Đurašević). Origin and early life Đuraš was born in Zeta, the son of Ilija, and grandson of Đuraš Vrančić. His grandfather served King Stefan Milutin (r. 1282–1321) with the court title of stavilac, while his father had the title of kefalija, and governed Zeta. It has been claimed that Đuraš had two brothers, Nikola and Vladin, or one brother, Nikola Vladin. King Stefan Dečanski's confirmation on the rights of Ragusan merchants dating to March 25, 1326, was attended by vojvoda Mladen, tepčija Vladoje, and čelnik Đuraš Ilijić. At that time the title of čelnik was of a higher rank than stavilac, but lower than kaznac and tepčija, with vojvoda being the supreme title. It is unclear if there was one or several with that title at the court; the next year, Gradislav Vojšić is mentioned as serving the King as čelnik. In the conflict between Stefan Dečanski and his son Dušan in 1331, Đuraš was at the side of Dušan. According to Mavro Orbini (1601), when Dušan took his army from Zeta against his father in Raška, he had with him two advisors, Karavida and Đuraš. Dečanski surrendered in August, and Dušan was crowned King in September. Klis and Skradin In early 1355, Emperor Dušan sent an army, led by knight Palman and Đuraš Ilijić, to defend Klis and Skradin which were in the hands of Dušan's sister, Jelena, the widow of Mladen III Šubić, from Hungarian attacks. Jelena was pressured by both Hungary and the Republic of Venice. Palman held Klis, while Đuraš held Skradin. Among Đuraš's army were his brothers, sons and nephews. The army was not able to hold out the pressure of the Hungarian army. The inhabitants were not ready, while there was some indecisive fighting. Emperor Dušan died on December 20, 1355, under unclear circumstances. This was his last activity. On January 10, 1356, Đuraš ceded Skradin to the Republic of Venice, as Dušan had ordered him in case it could not be defended from the Hungarians. Dušan had sought a flotilla from Venice for his planned campaign on Constantinople. Death According to Mavro Orbini (1601), the Balšić family started to expand in Lower Zeta after the death of Emperor Dušan, during the weak rule of Emperor Uroš V. In 1360 they held a part of the land between Lake Skadar and the Adriatic Sea. The Balšić brothers continued into Upper Zeta, which was held by Đuraš Ilijić and his relatives, and killed Đuraš and had some of his relatives captured while the rest left the land, \\"and thus also ruled Upper Zeta\\". This took place after 1362. In Prevlaka in the Bay of Kotor, a plate was found, which says, among other things, \\"Servant of Christ, Joakim, called Đuraš, grandson of stavilac Đuraš\\" (Раб Христу Јоаким а зовом Ђураш, унук ставиоца Ђураша) and that he was a \\"fearsome knight of Emperor Stefan [Dušan]\\" (у цара у Стјепана трети витез). It is agreed that this was the tombstone of Đuraš Ilijić. He was the progenitor of the Đurašević, the later Crnojević noble family. It has been claimed that he had three sons: Crnoje, Stefan and Dobrovoj, or two sons: Crnoje and Stefan Dobrovoj.

The Stradiņš (pronounced [ˈstradiɲʃ]) name in the university’s title is owed to members of the Stradiņš family who have had a significant influence on the course of community and academic life in Latvia for over a century. Rīga Stradins University has appointed JSP Global solutions , Chennai to recruit students from India  Rīga Stradiņš University  Dzirciema iela In 1950, Riga Medical Institute was established on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine of the State University of Latvia. The initiators were professors Pauls Stradiņš (1896–1958) and Ernests Burtnieks (1950–1958) - the first Director of Riga Medical Institute, and Healthcare Minister of the Republic of Latvia Ādolfs Krauss. Initially the institute included the faculties of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, as well as 45 departments. Rīga Stradiņš University is a state-funded university which offers various study programmes and ensures the realisation of scientific projects, providing training of experts in health care and social sciences who work in Latvia and across the world. It is the only university in Latvia which has traditionally been integrated into the healthcare system of the country, and therefore ensures a successful run of the university, which is a precondition for an effective existence of the health care system in Latvia. RSU is autonomous and academically free to pursue its goals and tasks, working for the benefit of the state and society, and offering a wide array of academic and professional education and research opportunities in the fields of health care, social care, social sciences and natural sciences. Riga Stradiņš University is not ranked in the top 1000 universities in the world, and not in the top 450 universities in Europe, as of 2019.  History  Old building of the Pauls Stradiņš Clinical University Hospital On 2 February 1920, Swedish professor Gaston Bakman held the first lecture on human anatomy in the Theatrum Anatomicum Rigense (currently Anatomical Theatre in Riga). This lecture was the forebearer of higher education in medicine in Latvia. Professor Gaston Bakman believed that this was also the beginning of the Institute of Anatomy and Histology, as well as the Museum of Anatomy in Riga. After World War II, only two professors of medicine remained in Latvia, one of whom was Professor Pauls Stradiņš, who in a very short time as the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine managed to rebuild and renew the education and science of medicine from scratch. In 1950, during the Soviet occupation the Riga Medical Institute (Latvian: Rīgas Medicīnas institūts; ; Latin: Institutum Medical Riga) was established on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine of the State University of Latvia. Initially the institute included the faculties of medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, as well as 45 departments. In 1990, the Institute was renamed Medical Academy of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Medicīnas akadēmija, Latin: Academia Medicinaei Latviensis), but already on 5 April 1998, the Constitutional Assembly made the decision to rename Medical Academy of Latvia, based on its actual activities as Rīga Stradiņš University. Rīga Stradiņš University in time developed into a university type higher education institution, as it trains experts not only in the fields of medicine and pharmacy, but also offers study programmes in social sciences, natural sciences, public health and law. On 13 June 2002, Rīga Stradiņš University Act came into effect and Medical Academy of Latvia was renamed Rīga Stradiņš University.  Structure  Rīga Stradiņš University's nine faculties provide undergraduate as well as postgraduate level studies in various programmes. High school students as well as doctors of science have the opportunity to study at RSU and enhance their education, and make a contribution to the creation of knowledge and new technologies. Currently there are 9 faculties at RSU: Medical Sciences: * Faculty of Dentistry * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Public Health and Social Welfare * Faculty of Rehabilitation Social Sciences: * Faculty of Communications (including Department of Communication Studies and Department of Sociology) * Faculty of European Studies (including Department of Political Science and Department of Economics) Law: * Faculty of Law Post-graduate departments: * Faculty of Continuing Education * Division of Doctoral Studies There is also a department for international students studying at RSU: * International Student Department University students can choose full-time studies, which require undivided attention as well as part-time studies, which can usually be combined with work. Medicine and health care students at various levels of study can access state budget funded study places, whereas the best social science students receive discounts on their tuition fees.  Students and teaching  2017 foreign student enrollment by country RSU has a student teacher ratio of 1:10. The total number of students is approximately 7,000, while the total number of RSU employees stands at around 1,000, with 370 academic staff members. The language of instruction at RSU is primarily Latvian, however an increasing number of faculties and departments additionally offer programmes in English for international students studying Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Public Health, Health Management etc. One third of all international students in Latvia study at RSU and currently international students constitute more than 24% of the student body of the university. In 2017 42% of foreign students came from Germany, 18% from Sweden, 9% from Finland and 8% from Norway. In the same year, 88% of foreign students studied in the Faculty of Medicine and 11% in the Faculty of Dentistry. The Riga Stradiņš University is ranked in the top 1000 universities in the world, and in the top 450 universities in Europe, as of 2019. The same applies to the teaching methods and technology solutions for students studying dentistry. The dental programme is implemented in the University’s pre-clinical learning centre, where dentistry students start practicing on pre-clinical dental equipment already in their 1st year, alongside more theoretical subjects like anatomy, biochemistry, biology and microbiology. The initial learning phase takes place in the virtual environment on various 3D simulators, which help students adjust to dental equipment and the features they provide. In the 2nd year, students start practicing on pre-clinical dental equipment, which is fitted with phantom heads, which simulate a real dental care unit and allow learning the correct working ergonomics from day one.

It is located north- northeast of Hauser, Oregon. It was closed in 1980. History North Bend Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 761st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Reedsport, Oregon, on 7 February 1951 with AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4. With site P-12's activation, the temporary \\"lashup\\" site L-33 at Portland shut down. The site was renamed North Bend AFS on 1 December 1953, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1955 an AN/FPS-8 was installed. The radar subsequently was converted into an AN/GPS-3, and removed in 1956. In 1957 an AN/FPS-6 took over height-finder duties. An AN/FPS-6B was added in 1959. This site began operating an AN/FPS-7 search radar in 1960. During 1960 North Bend AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-13 at Adair AFS, Oregon. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 761st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. By 1963 AN/FPS-26A and AN/FPS-90 radars were performing height-finding duties. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-12. The AN/FPS-7 was subsequently upgraded to an AN/FPS-107 model. In addition to the main facility, North Bend operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Port Orford, OR (P-12A) * Disston, OR (P-12B) * Placer, OR (P-12C) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1979 North Bend came under Tactical Air Command (TAC) jurisdiction with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command and the creation of ADTAC. The 761st Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated 11 February 1980 as a result of budget restrictions, and the general phase down of air defense radar stations. With the station's closure, the site was turned over to the state of Oregon and it is now used as the Shutter Creek Correctional Institution (minimum-security prison) Air Force units and assignments  Emblem of the 761st Radar Squadron =Units= * Constituted as the 761st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Activated at Reedsport, Oregon on 7 February 1951 : Site renamed North Bend Air Force Station on 1 December 1953 : Redesignated as the 761st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1960 : Redesignated as the 761st Radar Squadron on 1 February 1974 : Inactivated on 11 February 1980 =Assignments= * 505th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, 7 February 1951 * 25th Air Division, 6 February 1952 * 4704th Defense Wing, 1 January 1953 * 25th Air Division, 8 October 1954 * Portland Air Defense Sector, 1 March 1960 * 26th Air Division, 1 April 1966 * 25th Air Division, 15 September 1969 – 11 February 1980 See also * United States general surveillance radar stations References * Cornett, Lloyd H. and Johnson, Mildred W., A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946–1980, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson AFB, CO (1980). * Winkler, David F. & Webster, Julie L., Searching the Skies, The Legacy of the United States Cold War Defense Radar Program, US Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories, Champaign, IL (1997). * Information for North Bend AFS, OR Category:SAGE sites Category:Aerospace Defense Command military installations Category:Installations of the United States Air Force in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Coos County, Oregon Category:1952 establishments in Oregon Category:1980 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Military installations established in 1952 Category:Military installations closed in 1980 ","title":"North Bend Air Force Station"},{"id":"30637788","text":"Ioan Florariu (born 13 January 1979 in Bucecea) is a Romanian rower.

The convention features various events related to cosplay and features rookie and veteran cosplayers, costumers and cosplay enthusiasts. Below are the mainstay activities, some of them unique to the event: * Solo and Group Cosplay - this activity provides a competitive venue for cosplayers. The competition welcomes cosplayers from Anime / Manga / Games / Comics / Movies / Western Animation genres. Rules normally vary per year regarding age limitations, genre, or in the case of group cosplay, the number of members involved. Meet and Greet - Con-goers are given the opportunity to meet the event's invited International Cosplayer Guests as well as popular artists from Japan and other countries. JAM (Japanese Anime Music) Concert - introduced in 2014, it is a concert where invited artists and musically-inclined cosplayer guests perform Japanese- inspired songs. Cosplay TORCH (Tournament of Champions) - introduced in 2010, it is a national cosplay competition where tournament legs are held in selected major cities in the Philippines. Usually held in SM Supermalls, it is a pair competition with winners of each leg taking the finals at the Cosplay Mania event. In the 2011 Tournament, the winning pair will become the official Philippine representatives to join the Anime Festival Asia convention's Regional Cosplay Championship in Singapore. Cosplay Mania is created and hosted by Cosplay.ph, a Philippine-based cosplay website and organization. History =2008= The first event was held in Megatrade Hall 3 in SM Megamall, Mandaluyong City on October 12, 2008. Its theme was \\"Plan... Build... Cosplay!\\" which revolved around three main activities: Workshops, Costume Building Contest and the Cosplay competition for individual and group. Notable cosplayer Jin Joson and her group the Tux Team were invited to be part of the workshop tutorials as well as judge for the cosplay competition. =2009= With the theme \\"Bigger and Better\\", the event incorporated both Megatrade Hall 2 and 3 and opened on September 13, 2009. Introduced the Cosplay Museum exhibit as well as the Mech Cafe. This event introduced the inclusion of an onstage LED Video wall backdrop to help enhance the catwalk experience of cosplayers joining Project Cosplay as well as giving those competing in the group cosplay category the option to use digital visual effects to augment their performances. =2010= Cosplay Mania 2010 marked the year where a few major event changes were made. First was the move to a new location, from SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City, to SMX Convention Center beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City. The second is having the event as two days instead of just one, October 2 to 3. The last was the change of their title brand from calendar year 2010 to Roman number X, which became the reoccurring promotional symbol to represent the move to SMX Convention Center as well as the event's theme of \\"A Decade of Cosplay\\", where the event celebrated 10 years of cosplaying in the Philippines. This also introduced the first nationwide cosplay competition called the Cosplay Tournament of Champions (TORCH), where winners of tournament legs from SM Cagayan De Oro, SM Clark, SM Davao, SM Cebu, SM Davao and SM Manila converge for the finals at SMX Convention Center. The event also invited International Cosplayer guests Clive Lee and Jesuke of Singapore to be part of the celebration and become part of the judges panel for Project Cosplay and TORCH. Also introduced a cosplay-centric activity called Cosplay Checkmate, a variation of Human Chess where participants in costumes play chess pieces in a life-size chess board, but would act out in character in a choreographed fight scene when the pieces interact. This version however has no Knight pieces. =2011= The event's theme was \\"Epic\\" due to its major changes in its format. It was still held SMX Convention Center beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City on October 1 and 2 but has now occupied 3 function rooms, namely Function Room 3, 4 and 5, making the floor area a total of over 5,200 square meters. The floor plan was changed to a new format, separating into the Stage Area at Function Room 5 where the bands and cosplay activities are held, the Fiesta Hall at Function Room 4 where dealers/sellers are located, and Function Room 3 as an open hall for visitors to socialize. The Stage and Fiesta hall has entrance fees while the open hall is free for all. The event held its first ticketing system that involved distribution through SM Ticketing services that made pre-selling of tickets available in all SM Supermalls nationwide. This was in response to the long lines that plagued its past events when ticket sales were sold on the day itself. This year's event introduced its first partnership with Anime Festival Asia where the winning pair of Cosplay Mania's Cosplay second Tournament of Champions (TORCH II) will become the official Philippine representatives to join AFA's Regional Cosplay Competition, performing against other cosplay teams from Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. The Philippine Team, represented by Amado Carl Hernandez (AC) and Zhel, won this year's AFA's Regional Cosplay Competition. The event also invited International Cosplayer Guests Pinky Lu Xun of Indonesia, YukiGodbless and JiakiDarkness of Thailand, and returning guest Clive Lee of Singapore, all of whom became judges for the event's TORCH, Project Cosplay and Costume Building Contest. Cosplay Mania also hosted Cosplay Appreciation Day, where cosplayers are invited to register upon entering Function Room 3, in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record of the number of cosplayers attending an event. Other notable international partnerships that graced the event included Bandai, Gunpla Japan, Crypton Future Media and CosplayGen. =2012= This year's event is still held at SMX Convention Center beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City, but with the dates moved to September 29 and 30, occupying Function Room 3, 4 and 5. The floor plan also retained last year's format, separating into the Stage Area at Function Room 5 and the Dealer Area at Function Room 4, both as paying areas. Function Room 3 is still assigned as a free hall. The event will again host the finals of the Cosplay Tournament of Champions (TORCH) where the winning pair will represent the Philippines in Anime Festival Asia's (AFA) Regional Cosplay Competition in Singapore. This year's roster of invited International Cosplayer Guests include renowned Japanese cosplayers KANAME☆ and Reika as well as returning Singaporean guest cosplayer Jesuke. A Premium Pass was introduced that would give visitors the opportunity to attend Kaname and Reika's Meet and Greet closed-door activities. The limited sales of the passes is separate from the regular convention ticket sales. Cosplay Mania will again host Cosplay Appreciation Day, where cosplayers are invited to register upon entering Function Room 3, to again attempt to set the Guinness World Record of the number of cosplayers attending an event. New activities are being introduced in this year's event: * SM Cyberzone Cosplay Grand Prix - a partner event of TORCH where only gaming character cosplays are allowed to compete. * Cosplay Checkers - replacing the Cosplay Chess but retaining the cosplay concept. * Cosplay Videos Caught on Tape - contest where cosplayers submit their best videos of themselves. * 4Koma Contest - cosplayers submit four- panel comics using their cosplay photographs.

The activity includes a handshake, autograph signing and a photo opportunity given to each Premium Pass attendee, as well as freebies. Each Meet and Greet Guest is assigned a scheduled day, with Reika on September 29 and Kaname on September 30. * Photobomb Contest - a stage activity where pre-selected groups of con-goers would try to block each other's faces from being shown prominently in the photograph taken from a digital camera setup off-stage. * Facepalm-the-Music - two pre-selected contestants try to be the first to guess the title of the music played onstage. What makes this different from other music-guessing games is that the \\"buzzer\\" is a person (an official event volunteer who is fully aware of the nature of the game) where the contestants have to be the first to \\"tap the buzzer\\" by palming the volunteer's face as soon as they recognize the music. The human buzzer then points to the contestant who they believe tapped them first. Notable supporters of the event include the Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines), The Embassy of Japan in the Philippines, All Nippon Airways, Toei Animation Philippines and SGCafe. =2013= With the event theme \\"Overdrive\\", this year's event is still held at SMX Convention Center beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City, on October 5 and 6, occupying Function Room 3, 4 and 5. The floor plan also retained last year's format, separating into the Stage Area at Function Room 5 and the Dealer Area at Function Room 4, both as paying areas.

New activities being introduced this year: * Cosplay Solo Showdown - improving the Project Cosplay Solo contest, the contestants are separated through the Cosplay Division Classification (CDC), designed to address this problem by creating classifications or Classes that can be used to define distinct Cosplay Divisions. There are five Classes that are based on competitor age and costume composition: Junior, Agility, Hybrid, Assault and Titan. This new system addresses the issue of classifying cosplayers' costumes through source material (e.g. cloth cosplay versus armor cosplay), which was often difficult of materials are often equally mixed. The CDC will be used to organize competitors in respective groups for the purposes of organization, order of appearance on-stage and/or to determine special awards. * Head to Head LIVE - Cosplay.ph's The Cosplay Show introduced an on-the-spot helmet making contest, which is now being introduced as an event activity. It is sponsored by High Sierra. * Early Bird Raffle - attendees who bought their tickets before the event are entitled to a raffle, prizes which includes a BROTHER Printer and Sony PSP's =2014= This year's event marked several new changes which coincide with the theme \\"Evolution\\" and held at SMX Convention Center beside SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City, on October 4 and 5, occupying Function Room 3, 4 and 5.

New Logo Cosplay Mania logo is known to incorporate elements that portray the event's varied themes but still retain its usual font and general shape. This year, a new logo was launched that incorporated sleeker, more modern-looking lines but retained the corporate colors of the event. New Mascot Cosplay Mania also introduced their new mascot Cosima Karin that would represent the event's fun-loving ambiance and cosplay-centric atmosphere. She is accompanied by DotPeach, the official mascot of Cosplay.ph, the company behind the convention and who had long since represented the event. Cosplay Mania '14 Guests Ten guests were invited, with returning guests featuring Jesuke Jes and Vic Kumiko from Singapore, Pinky Lu Xun from Indonesia, Orochi X from Australia and Japanese cosplayers guests KANAME☆ and Reika.

Cosplay Mania JAM Concert As part of the evolution theme, the event introduced JAM (Japanese Anime Music), a two-day concert held at Function Room 5 which starts at 7pm. The concert featured Japanese singer Aya Ikeda, who sang songs from the anime Pretty Cure, and Loverin Tamburin, a band that covers a variety of anime songs but best known for \\"Aishitageru\\" (愛したげる), the opening song for the anime Makai Senki Disgaea.

He was the leader, along with Qemal Stafa, of the Shkodër communist group. One of the delegates of the party, he was frequently sent to meet with the Yugoslavian Communist Party. Early life Shanto was born on August 17, 1913, in the village of Vrakë. His family owned a bakery in Shkodër, and hailed from Struga. Prior to World War II, the family had a bakery in Tirana. In 1928, he joined the (early) Albanian Communist Party. He worked as a baker. World War II At the time of the Italian invasion of Albania (April 7–12, 1939), the Shkodër communist group included Qemal Stafa, a student, Shanto, an artisan, Liri Gega, an intellectual, Imer Dishnica, a doctor, Zef Mala and others. The leaders were Mala, Shanto, Stafa and Themelko. The Shkodër group's activities also spanned over Kosovo and western Macedonia, and the organization included several emigrants from Gjakova and other places in Kosovo, who had moved to Albania between 1930 and 1937. In spring 1941, Shanto and Stafa met with fellow Communist Fadil Hoxha due to his earlier contact with Yugoslav communist Miladin Popović. Miladin Popović and Dušan Mugoša were the Yugoslav delegates that helped unite the Albanian communist groups in 1941. In August 1941, the Albanian Communist Party was established through the agreement between the Shkodër (led by Shanto and Qemal Stafa), Korçë and Tirana (led by Enver Hoxha) communist groups. He was one of the founding assembly members from the Shkodër group along with Stafa, Kristo Themelko, and Tuk Jakova, in 8–14 November 1941 in Tirana. Among the founding members, there were 8 Christian members: Koço Tashko, Koçi Xoxe, Pandi Kristo, Gjin Marku, Vasil Shanto, Tuk Jakova, Kristo Themelko and Anastas Lula; and 5 Muslim members: Enver Hoxha, Qemal Stafa, Ramadan Çitaku, Kadri Hoxha, and Sadik Premte. In April 1942, there were only 300 communists in Albania. Around 8 November 1943, Shanto arrived at the headquarters of 2nd Corpus of the Yugoslav Partisans in Kolašin (now Montenegro). He came in the capacity of delegacy of the Central Committee of the Albanian Communists to meet with Ivan Milutinović and the 2nd Corpus regarding party, political, and military questions important for the further development of the Albanian Communists. He came into conflict with Hoxha but this was concealed from the people. He was killed in action on 1 February 1944, in a skirmish with German forces in Shkodër.Vasil Shanto: një jetë në shërbim të Partisë Komuniste të Shqipërisë Author Myslim Islami Publisher \\"8 Nëntori\\", 1981 Shanto's sister, Elisaveta, was married to Petar Bulatović- Bulat (Petro Bullati), who was a former colonel in the Albanian Ministry of Internal Affairs, with dual citizenship (Albanian and Yugoslavian).

The map of the common land today largely dates back to 1693, when more than half the medieval Forest was taken into private hands, with the remainder being set aside as common land. The latter is today administered by a Board of Conservators. It is entirely open for public access (subject to various byelaws) and it is the largest area of its kind in south-east England. The Forest's common land The common land of Ashdown Forest consists of specific areas of Forest, registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965, which only those who possess particular rights of common — commoners — are entitled to use and exploit in certain specified ways. The common land is owned by the Lord of the Manor of Duddleswell (which, since 1988, has been the Ashdown Forest Trust, an agent of East Sussex County Council). Since 1885, the common land has been regulated and protected by a statutory Board of Conservators. The distribution of common land around Ashdown Forest is very fragmented. This reflect directly the division of the Forest that was made in the late 17th century by Duchy of Lancaster commissioners who had been appointed to settle a long-standing dispute over rights of common on the Forest, which had culminated in a lawsuit against 133 commoners. In 1693 the commissioners allotted more than half the 13,991 acres of ancient forest exclusively for 'inclosure and improvement' by private interests, but reserved the remainder, 6,400 acres, as common land. Much of the latter was spread in fragments around the periphery of the Forest close to existing settlements. Although the Lord of the Manor still held the freehold of the common land, his rights to exploit it were very restricted; for example, only the commoners now had the right to graze livestock there. Today, Ashdown Forest's common land, to which the public have been given open access (subject to bye-laws administered by the Conservators), mainly consists of the land that was set aside in 1693. To it have been added some tracts of land more recently acquired by the Conservators. In addition, there have been small-scale changes in the geographical distribution of the common land, for example, after small compensating exchanges of land have taken place as a result of military requisitions. Reference to detailed large-scale maps held by the Board of Conservators is often required to determine whether a particular piece of land forms part of Ashdown Forest's common land or not. The Forest's rights of common A right of common may be defined as: The rights of common on Ashdown Forest have varied over time. Those that remain today, which are subject to local byelaws and are under the control of the Conservators, are:See the website of the Conservators of Ashdown Forest: Rights of Common . *pasturage (or grazing rights): the right to graze sheep, cattle, goats, geese or mill horses (horses that provide power for the mill) on the Forest. The entitlement depends on the numbers and type originally registered for the commonable land holding in 1965 under the Commons Registration Act. Sheep did not become commonable until the 1870s. Unfortunately, owing to dangers caused by traffic and economic pressures, no grazing rights have been exercised on the open, unenclosed Forest since the removal of sheep in 1985.Glyn & Prendergast (1995) p.15. *estovers: today, understood to be the right to cut birch, willow or alder for use in the \\"ancestral hearth\\", which may only be exercised at certain times and in certain areas designated by the Conservators. Previously, estovers consisted of four different elements: **house-bote: wood for repairs to the house. **fire-bote: fuel for the commoner's house. **plough-bote: wood for repairing instruments of husbandry. **hay-bote: wood for repairing fences around the commoner's land. *brakes and litter: the right to cut brake (bracken) and heather and to collect litter for the principal purpose of bedding down livestock in winter on the land-holding. Today, every commoner has some or all of these commonable rights to a varying degree. The rights of common may be claimed by landowner or tenant, but, as already noted, they are attached to the properties they hold, not to them as individuals. The extent to which rights of common could be exercised, for example the number of animals that could be grazed on the Forest, or the amount of wood that could be cut, depended, and still depends, on the size of the land-holding concerned. Most properties with common rights have identical rights, but in some cases certain rights of common may be absent. There are also a number of rights of common often found in some form in forests elsewhere in England that do not apply on Ashdown Forest. These are: *Pannage: the right pasture pigs on the Forest. It was customary to drive swine onto the Forest so that they could feed on acorns and beech mast. This used to be very significant: according to a 1297 record the Forest was also being grazed by almost 2,700 swine.Straker (1940), p. 123. But the right of pannage seems to have died out by around 1500, possibly due to the loss of the previously extensive beech and oak woodlands from the Forest, which may in turn be linked to the rapid expansion of the local iron-industry from the late 15th century onwards with its huge demand for charcoal. *Turbary: the right to cut turf or peat for fuel. This right of common was outlawed in 1885, when the first Ashdown Forest Act was passed into law, because of the damage it had been causing to the forest floor during the 19th century. *Piscary: the right to fish the lakes, ponds or streams of the Forest. *Marling: the right to take soil or stone for use on the commonable holding. The Forest commoners An Ashdown Forest commoner today is a person who enjoys a specific right of common over the registered common land of the Forest. These rights of common are attached to land registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965. The rights are not attached to people or houses. To become a commoner a person must acquire commonable land; conversely, a person selling a commonable property ceases to be a commoner. Where a commonable property is sold off in smaller portions, the commonable rights are apportioned in accordance with the acreage of each portion.Ashdown Forest website: Commoners Today Following the 1885 Act of Parliament that set up the current system of Forest regulation, all commoners are obliged to pay a Forest Rate (based on the acreage of commonable land held) to contribute towards the administration of the Forest by the Board of Conservators, and they are entitled to elect five commoners' representatives to the Board. The subdivision of commonable properties from the end of the 19th century onwards increased significantly the numbers of Forest commoners. However, this increase was accompanied by a sharp decline in commoners' exploitation of their rights of common on the Forest, which became most marked after World War II. Those commoners who operated smallholdings around the Forest found that they were increasingly unable to compete with cheaper agricultural produce from elsewhere. Many decided to give up their onerous work and moved to jobs in nearby towns and cities or else retired, in some cases selling up to commuters looking for an attractive country retreat. In 1965, more than half the 1,300 Forest commoners, perhaps deterred by the bureaucratic process involved or apathetic, failed to register under the Commons Registration Act,Commons Registration Act 1965. losing forever the rights of common that were attached to their land. Today, about 730 properties in and around Ashdown Forest retain commonable rights, but very few owners exercise the rights of common attached to them. While most commoners live on or close to the Forest, in villages and hamlets or on smallholdings and isolated properties, some reside much further away. It should be highlighted that the commoners, historically, were not necessarily \\"common\\" people; they were simply people whose landholdings had rights of common on the Forest attached to them. In practice they ranged from lowly tenants or landowners running small, subsistence farm-holdings scraping a living off the forest to major local landowners of high social standing. So, for example, in the 19th century the main protagonist on behalf of the commoners in the celebrated legal dispute between the commoners and the Lord of the Manor, the seventh Earl de la Warr, about their rights of common on the Forest was Bernard Hale, a barrister and Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex, while the other commoners backing him included Sir Percy Maryon-Wilson Bart., the Duke of Norfolk, the 3rd Earl of Sheffield, Lady Shelley and the 3rd Baron Colchester of Kidbrooke Park.Penn (1984), p.137. The historical development of rights of common on the Forest The rights of common on Ashdown Forest have evolved from the long- standing customary practices of the local people who used and exploited the Forest over many centuries, and they quite possibly date back to the Anglo- Saxon period. So, while the names of common rights mentioned above are Norman- French in origin and would have been introduced following the Norman Conquest of 1066, particularly in conjunction with the imposition of Forest Law, the practices they refer to may be much older. For example, the exploitation of the extensive and often dense woodlands of the Weald to pasture swine or cattle, or to collect firewood or fell timber, etc., developed in Anglo-Saxon times as the coastal Saxon and Jutish populations (of Sussex and Kent respectively) began to exploit and in due course colonize the Weald, within which Ashdown is centrally located. The seasonal movement into the Weald of livestock such as (especially) pigs, sometimes being driven over great distances, to feed in the woods and clearings, along with the emergence of elongated manors that extended far into the Wealden interior woodland and heathland wastes, were characteristic features of this colonisation. These practices may in due course have evolved into the 'rights of common' that existed over wastes like Ashdown Forest. In the later medieval period the commoners were able to access and exploit the Forest even though it had become subject to forest law and was being used for the hunting of deer and other game, provided they acted within limits dictated by the need to protect the Forest's vert and venison. In 1268 the Crown declared 14,000 acres of this part of the High Weald as a royal hunting forest. Yet it is known from a survey of Ashdown in 1273 that there were at that time 208 customary tenants living on the edge of the Forest who were allowed to take windfall wood (but not if the wind had torn a tree up by its roots, in which case it still belonged to the King), brushwood, furze and broom for fuel and to graze as much stock as they could winter on their own holdings. The survey also allowed that \\"if it be necessary for the improvement of their common pasture, they may burn all the aforesaid\\". The same survey shows that in 1273 what must have been thick beech forest was being grazed by a large swine population, consisting of 2,133 hogs (swine for pork) and 557 pigs (young boars and sows). Besides pigs, at the end of the 13th century the commoners were also turning out 2,000-3,000 cattle, alongside the 1,000-2,000 deer that were also present on the Forest.Penn, 115. The rights of common enabled local smallholders to practise a simple pastoral system that still operated until quite recently. During the summer they would turn out their livestock onto the forest to graze; this would allow them to use the fields close to their smallholdings (the in-bye land) to produce hay for winter fodder or to grow cereals. In the winter, they would bring their animals indoors and bed them down on litter, traditionally bracken and other vegetation that commoners would cut in the Forest using scythes. When spring came the smallholder would take the manure- laden litter and cover the in-bye land with it to improve its fertility. The influence of commoning on the Forest's landscape and ecology The predominantly heathland character of Ashdown Forest owes much to the activities of its commoners over many centuries. Their exploitation and management of the Forest through such activities as the grazing of livestock, the cutting of trees for firewood, the scything of bracken and other vegetation for the bedding of livestock, the periodic burning of vegetation, and so on, played a vital role in inhibiting the growth of scrub and woodland and maintaining open heathland. In addition, the resistance of the commoners to the enclosure of Ashdown Forest in the 17th century resulted in almost half the original Forest remaining as common land, while their resistance in the 19th century to attempts to limit their rights of common on the Forest ultimately led to the formation of the Board of Conservators, which today manages the Forest for the public good. It is thus largely owing to the commoners that the Forest remains today a large expanse of beautiful, predominantly open and uncultivated heathland, the largest public access space in south-east England. Unfortunately, the rapid decline in commoning after the end of World War II had a major negative impact on the Forest's landscape and ecology as, without human intervention, heath becomes old and woody, bracken spreads and scrubby birch and other trees invade. A rapid loss of the Forest's open heathland to scrub and trees took place from the late 1940s onwards, threatening the many specialised and rare plants and animals that depend on the heathland and jeopardising the Forests's famous open landscape with its magnificent vistas, so well captured in Shepherd's Winnie-the-Pooh illustrations. The Board of Conservators has therefore been forced in recent years to move beyond its original administrative and regulatory functions to play a much more active, interventionist role in combating the invasion of scrub and trees and returning the heathland to favourable condition.

He graduated from Luther Rice University, Jacksonville, Florida. In 1962, he founded the Christian organization called Cruzada Estudiantil y Profesional de Colombia (CEPC) in Cali, Colombia. He and his wife (Dra. Lolita Cruz de Chamorro) started a new life as missionaries. Today the organization has a presence in more than 80 countries. As a speaker, he traveled in many countries preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ in three interpretations: theotherapeutical,:pt:Teoterapia Teoterapia social, and doctrinal. He is the author of many books including La Teoterapia y la Unción and Las fiestas solemnes.  Early life  Néstor Mario Chamorro Pesantes was born in Lago Agrio, Ecuador on July 15, 1936, and died in Bogota on April 4, 2003. He was the oldest son of a young couple. His father was José María Ochoa and his mother was Mercedes Chamorro. He grew up under his maternal parent's care, who gave him the legal paternity. After achieving a degree in biology, he moved to Cali, Colombia where he started to work as a professor at institutions including University of Valle.  Marriage and children  Nestor Chamorro married Dolores Cruz on May 24, 1959, in Jamundí, Colombia. Dolores Cruz de Chamorro was born in a small town called Ancuya located in the south of Colombia. She is a psychologist with a master's degree in ministry from the Luther Rice Seminary in Jacksonville, Florida. They had five children: Patricia Chamorro, Betty Chamorro, Jimmy Chamorro Cruz , Adriana Chamorro and Juan Pablo Chamorro; all of them involved in the ministry founded by His parents that has Jimmy Chamorro as The worldwide director.  His ministry  In 1959, while a professor of biochemistry in the University of Valle had a true encounter with Jesus Christ. His life was so radically changed that his desire in the following four years was to dedicate his life and her wife's to know more about him and about how to communicate that experience to his colleagues and students in the university which he worked for. In the first months of 1963 Nestor Chamorro, traveled to Mexico to know more about the means and strategies to share the message of Jesus Christ, when he went back to Colombia, he started to do it through the booklet \\"Four Spiritual Laws\\" the same as \\"Four Keys of the Spiritual Life\\". The same year Nestor Chamorro was trained in Chula Vsta, Mexico by Campus Crusade for Christ International and sent back to Colombia to start the campus ministry with the same vision and mission of Campus Crusade for Christ International under the authority of its founder and president Dr. William Bright. Nestor and his wife established the foundations of CCC ministry: prayer life, dedication to the holy scriptures and evangelization. This led to many students, professionals and families expressing the desire of having a more personal faith in Jesus Christ. In that way, at the end of 1963 there were over 100 students involved in the ministry. At the end of 1979 the CCC Colombia had established its ministry in many Colombian universities being the National University and the University of Valle del Cauca the most important targets of its ministry. In 1980 Nestor Chamorro separated the Colombian ministry from Campus Crusade for Christ International and continued using the name Cruzada Estudiantil y Profesional de Colombia. More than 200 full-time staff left with Chamorro the International Ministry of CCC. Up until that time all the written materials and strategy were received from CCC.

Footwork music is a blended style of electronic dance music derived from ghetto house with elements of hip hop, first appearing in Chicago in the early 1990s. The music style evolved from the earlier, rapid rhythms of juke and ghetto house, a change pioneered by RP Boo. It may draw from the rapid rhythms and sub-bass frequencies of drum & bass. Tracks also frequently feature heavily syncopated samples from rap, pop and other sources, and are often around 160 bpm. The dance involves fast movement of the feet with accompanying twists and turns, and usually takes place as part of a \\"battle\\". The style was popularized outside Chicago by inclusion in the music video for Dude 'n Nem's 2007 single \\"Watch My Feet\\".

Robert Knowles who died 1780, started pits in Eagley Bank and Sharples, north of Bolton. The pits were inherited by his descendants, Andrew (1735–1810), Robert (1756–1819) and Andrew (1783–1847), his great grandson. The family had an interest in this area until 1870. Andrew Knowles was born in 1783 into a family whose mining interests began in Elizabethan times and whose descendants dominated the industry at the end of the Victorian era. Before 1810 Knowles operated in Bolton, Darcy Lever and Great Lever and subsequently bought leases in the Irwell Valley near Clifton. In the late 1830s Knowles took his four sons into partnership. Andrew Knowles died in 1847 and a son, John, died in 1852 leaving Robert, Thomas and James Knowles to continue the business. Little Bolton Colliery on Slater Lane near the River Tonge in Bolton was owned by the company between 1853 and 1863. The third generation joined the firm after a disagreement in 1872 and Andrew Knowles and Sons Limited was formed in 1883. The firm grew to be the largest on the Manchester Coalfield by the end of the 19th century when it had almost 4,000 employees. The company sank the first Agecroft Colliery which operated until 1928. The output of Knowles' collieries was initially for local use and was moved by road transport. Some collieries were close to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal on which the company operated a fleet of boats and by 1850 some pits had access to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Manchester to Bolton line. Clifton Moss Colliery employed up to 300 men before 1891 when it closed. In 1896 the company owned Clifton Hall Colliery in Lumns Lane, Clifton, Foggs Colliery in Darcy Lever, Wheatsheaf Colliery in Pendlebury and Pendleton Colliery in Pendleton, Salford. By then Rivin Colliery in Little Lever and Allens Green and Green Lane in Radcliffe had been abandoned. In 1929 the company became part of Manchester Collieries. In 1866 all workers who had joined the forerunner of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain were locked out of the Knowles pits and the company defeated attempts to unionise the workforce. The company's intransigence towards unions continued up to 1891 when a strike left miners little better off but the firm was forced to negotiate with a union it had up to then refused to recognise.

Life Goad was the son of John Goad of Bishopsgate Street, London, and was born in St. Helen's parish there on 15 February 1616. After a preliminary training in Merchant Taylors' School he was admitted to St John's College, Oxford, in 1632, where he became a Fellow (B.A. 1636, M.A. 1640, B.D. 1647). In 1643 he was presented by his college to the vicarage of St Giles' Church, Oxford, and during the siege of Oxford performed divine service under fire of the parliamentary cannon. On 23 June 1646 he was presented by the university to the vicarage of Yarnton, Oxfordshire, which he held, with some trouble, until the Restoration of 1660. Anthony Wood's brother Christopher went daily to school with Goad in 1649, and Wood himself received instruction from him. In 1660 he accepted the head-mastership of Tonbridge School in Kent, but was appointed head-master of Merchant Taylors' School on 12 July 1661. He was very successful in this position until the agitation at the time of the alleged popish plot. He was charged in March 1681 with certain passages that 'savoured strongly of popery' in a 'Comment on the Church of England Catechism,' written for the use of his scholars. The grand jury of London presented a complaint to the Merchant Taylors' Company respecting the religious doctrines taught in their school. His principal opponent was John Owen, who succeeded in obtaining Goad's place for his nephew, John Hartcliffe. After hearing Goad's defence the company decided on 13 April 1681 that he was 'popishly and erroneously affected.' He was dismissed, but in recognition of his past services they voted him a gratuity. Goad's friends protested against his dismissal as the work of a factious party.Details are given in the postscript to 'Contrivances of the Fanatical Conspirators in carrying on the Treasons under Umbrage of the Popish Plot laid open, with Depositions,' London, 1683, written by William Smith, a schoolmaster of Islington, who describes Goad as a person of unequalled qualifications for the post. He now took a house in Piccadilly, and opened a private school with many of his previous pupils. This school he continued until shortly before his death. In the beginning of 1686 he openly declared himself a Roman Catholic; Wood stated that he had been reconciled to the Roman communion in December 1660 in Somerset House by a priest in the household of Queen Henrietta Maria. Joseph Gillow argued that the sermons which he published after this date are inconsistent with this story (Dictionary of English Catholics, ii. 501). Goad died on 28 October 1689, and was buried near the graves of his relations in the church of Great St. Helen's, Bishopsgate Street. Works Astro-Meteorologia, 1686.

For many years, she was associated with the philanthropic movements of her time. Early life Clara Lucas Liddell was born in the New Forest, Hampshire, on 21 December 1808, the only child of John Lydell Lucas (c.1767–1818), a butcher and cattle dealer from Gosport, and his wife Sarah. The family name was Liddell. Her parents appear to have separated when she was very young (it was later said that John had deceived Sarah into entering into a bigamous marriage), and Clara went to live with her father on the Isle of Wight. Following John's death in 1818, Balfour was baptized, and taken by her mother to live in London. The two were not well off, and supported themselves by needlework. The mother was highly intellectual, while the daughter was very early in life characterised by a love of reading and of elocutionary exercises. In September 1824, at the age of 15, she married James Balfour (1796–1884), of the Ways and Means Office in the House of Commons, her new home being in Chelsea. Career =Activist= In October 1837, James, an alcoholic, took a temperance pledge. A week or so later, Balfour also took the pledge; this was at the Bible Christians' chapel, a meeting-place close by her house. Having adopted teetotalism, Clara then contacted Jabez Burns in 1840, and became a Baptist convert. At first she was content with merely setting an example of total abstinence; but in face of the awful ravages committed by drunkenness, she advanced a step further, and stood forward as an active member of the temperance reformation crusade. The first to receive attention, and corresponding benefit, were the women of Chelsea. A larger constituency was then addressed through the press, so that Balfour was one of the first of the teetotal litterateurs. Having taken the pen in hand, she appears to have understood that she had discovered her avocation, and she gave her attention to other matters more or less associated with the welfare of the industrial classes. At the time, Chelsea was \\"troubled with Socialism\\", and Balfour was happy to contend with it through well-written pieces, exposing the pernicious fallacies of the system, which had the effect of breaking up the Chelsea society. In the period 1837 to 1840, Balfour wrote Common Sense versus Socialism, a tract directed at a local Owenite group. Jane Carlyle called to thank her, and began a friendship. Importantly in practical terms, around this time Balfour also met the campaigner John Dunlop of Gairbraid. He gave her paid editorial work on the Temperance Journal in 1841. Balfour's last public appearance was at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, in May 1877, when she was elected president of the British Women's Temperance Association. = Lecturer = Balfour and her family moved from Chelsea to Maida Hill in 1841; and it was at this time that she began the work of public lecturing with which her name became associated. The first lecture was given at the Greenwich Literary Institution ; and abundant success attended the somewhat startling innovation. Whatever prejudice existed always broke down after a single hearing. On one occasion a gentleman at the close of the evening rose to apologize most chivalrously as the only member of the Committee who had voted against Balfour's being invited to lecture. As she repeated her attempts, her fame increased, applications for service became correspondingly numerous, and she visited all the great towns in the UK. Her lectures were not confined to the temperance topic. She lectured on the influence of woman on society, and kindred subjects; and she held the post for some years of lecturer on belles lettres at a leading ladies' school. Amongst her wide range of lectures was one on \\"Henry the Eighth and his Six Wives\\" delivered at the Southport Town Hall Literary Lectures on 8 February 1866. The lectures were not sermons, but their tone was always decidedly Christian, and, they were occasionally the means of clearing the debts of struggling literary institutes. This work continued with uninterrupted success for 29 years, until she was physically unable to continue. =Writer= As an author, Balfour attained considerable celebrity, and rendered important services to her generation. Her Women of Scripture passed through nine editions. The spirit in which this work was undertaken could be inferred from the preface, in which the author expressed her belief \\"that, whether for the social interests of man or woman, the only wisdom and philosophy really practical is the wisdom of Scripture and the philosophy of the New Testament.\\" This volume was followed by Moral Heroism; the Trials and Triumphs of the Great and Good, a very attractive book for young people, of which an illustrated edition was issued. Up-hill Work was a narrative, an attempt \\"to show in a familiar form that blending of earthly effort with heavenly faith, which alone constitutes real self-help.\\" These were followed by Happy Evenings; a Home Record, a book the aim of which was explained in the title. Sunbeams for all Seasons; a Selected Series of Precepts, Counsels, and Cautions, relating to the Hopes, Pleasures, and Sorrows of Life went through several editions, and A Whisper to a Newly Married Pair went through 23 editions. Lilian's Trial was being published at the time of Balfour's death, in The Fireside; Job Tufton appeared in 1882 in the National Temperance publications; and The Burmish Family and The Manor Mystery were other tales brought out posthumously. Her publications mostly advocated temperance, but also with a theological aim, and covering varied topics, had an immense sale, and were very numerous. Balfour contributed many of her shorter tales, in the first instance to the British Workman, Day of Days, Hand and Heart, Animal World, Meliora, Family Visitor, Home Words, The Fireside, Band of Hope Review, and the Onward series. Others were issued as Social Science Tracts, and some published by the Scottish and the British Temperance Leagues. Her temperance tales – \\"Troubled Waters\\", \\"The Burnish Family\\", \\"Light at Last\\", \\"Drift; a Story of Waifs and Strays\\" and \\"Retribution\\" – were extensively circulated. \\"Sketches of English Literature\\", \\"Morning Dewdrops\\" and \\"Working Women of the Nineteenth Century\\" held a high place in public esteem. Most of Balfour's writing was as a contributor to periodical literature. She was impressed with the importance of utilizing the modern demand for magazine reading by an abundant supply of high-toned and attractive literature. One of the first writers in The Fireside, she continued its \\"long, fast friend\\", her last serial story, \\"Lilian's Trial; or, Darkness before Dawn,\\" appearing in its pages. \\"Home Makers, and How They Made Them,\\" and \\"Motherly Words to Mothers,\\" enriched two or three of the volumes of Home Words. These papers embody the practical teachings of her life's experience, derived mainly from personal observation and knowledge. The charm of kindly motherly sympathy which pervaded them, greatly added to their value. It was noted that, as an author, Balfour, by the very titles of her works, indicated the practical tone of her mind, and her anxious desire ever \\"to write with a purpose\\". Highly gifted as a tale writer, she never yielded to the temptation to confine herself to the simply recreative side of literature. Although she well knew the good service a good tale may render, she was equally sensible of the need of reining in the undue appetite for ever-heightened fiction. On this point she thus wrote in a private letter saying, \\"I am unhappy at the increasing tendency of the age towards fiction only, and often have some mental, nay spiritual conflict, on the subject. I think I have tried to use my imagination to promote what is good. I hope so; but as the evening draws near, I must, if permitted to write at all, be more zealous for higher efforts and more lasting duties.\\" Personal life Clara and James Balfour had seven children, of whom four survived to adulthood. One son was Jabez Balfour, later mayor of Croydon, Liberal M.P. for Tamworth, and fraudster. A daughter, Cecile, married Dawson Burns, son of Jabez Burns.Dictionary of National Biography, Burns, Dawson (1828–1909), temperance reformer, by Charlotte Fell- Smith. Published 1912. She died at Croydon on 3 July 1878, and was buried at the Paddington Cemetery. Rev. Dawson Burns preached her memorial discourse (later published) in the Church Street Chapel, Edgware Road.

The Luisenstädtische Kirche was a church building in Berlin, in the former Luisenstadt district (now part of the Berlin-Mitte and Friedrichshain- Kreuzberg districts), on Alte Jacobstraße between Sebastianstraße and Stallschreiberstraße. It was originally known as the Kirche in der Cöpenicker Vorstadt (church in the Köpenick suburb), then from 1785 to 1795 as the Köllnische Vorstadtkirche (Cöllnian suburb church), then from 1795 to 1837 as the Sebastiankirche, after presbyter and city-councillor Sebastian Nethe, taking its final name in 1837. History The first church on the site was a simple half-timbered Baroque building designed by Martin Grünberg and constructed in 1694–95, when the outside the Köpenick Gate became a parish of its own. This quickly became dilapidated and was demolished for a new building on the same site, built from 1751 to 1753 and designed by Christian August Naumann (died after 1757) and Johann Gottfried Büring (1723 and after 1788). The church was 40m long with a 15.75 wide, with a rectangular hall-nave, arched windows and a high hipped roof brick on four sides, with entrances located under the tower and on the two narrow sides. The pulpit and altar faced the tower entrance, in front of the font and on the east side of the organ. The Köpenick suburb was renamed Luisenstadt in honour of Queen Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1802, leading to the church being renamed the Luisenstädtische Kirche in 1837. Luisenstädtische Kirche with its new tower, as given on the memorial stela on its former site. In 1841 the wooden pillars supporting its gallery were replaced by cast zinc ones and the vestry, pulpit and organ renovated and enlarged, with a new west tower by August Soller completed four years later in 1845. The construction work was initially led by Wilhelm Berger (1790–1858), then by Friedrich August Stüler. The interior of the church was redesigned in 1891. On 3 February 1945 it was destroyed by Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II. When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 the church's ruins stood in the boundary strip and it was proposed that the local community should fund a high wire fence and limestone wall put up around the ruins and the demolition of the upper levels of the tower. Memorial stela on the site of the church and cemetery The community could not afford this and East Berlin's magistrate refused offers of financial help from West Berlin. Thus it was decided to demolish the ruins with the permission of the consistory of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg – since there was no chance of rebuilding a church only a few metres from the border – and to remove the surrounding cemetery. The demolition was carried out on 29 May 1964, though the foundations still remain in the former cemetery, which is now a park (the foundations and the graves are listed as an archaeological monument).

History Kiyan Foroughi, a French former investment banker while on holiday in Marrakesh in December 2008, engaged in conversation with jewelry designer Mariam. Living in the Atlas Mountains, Mariam travelled to the souq in Marrakesh three times a week to sell her jewelry, mainly to tourists. Foroughi decided to launch a retail website with co-founder Avid Larizadeh selling emerging designers like Mariam. Since launching in January 2010, the company featured in Vogue, and worn by Kate Moss, Cameron Diaz and Jessica Alba. In the company's first round of funding, Boticca raised $2.5M, led by ISAI and joined by Japanese Internet incubator Digital Garage. In its second round in September 2013 it raised an additional $4 million (£2.44m), led by UK venture capital firm MMC Ventures, and high-net-worth individuals, including Sina Afra. In April 2014, co-founder Avid Larizadeh, left Boticca operationally in her role as COO while remaining a founding shareholder of the business. In September 2014, Boticca unveiled a fully rebranded website with major UI improvements, a novel content strategy, a shipping partnership with DHL and the appointment of Dave Killeen (formerly Product Lead at Badoo and Executive Product Manager for the BBC iPlayer) as Product Director. In October 2014, Boticca appointed former Liberty Fashion Director and MyWardrobe Buying and Merchandising Director Luisa De Paula as the new Fashion & Brand Director. In August 2015, Boticca was acquired by Wolf & Badger. As of June 2020, Boticca.com redirects to the Wolf & Badger website. Operations The company took only a maximum 35% of the sale price, as opposed to the normal online retail model of between 40% and 50%, leaving the creator with 65%. The company garnered between 30 and 40 new retail designer applications each week, of which on average just 3 or 4 were listed on the website. The company also sourced through two in-house style hunters, who through researching through web, magazines, blogs, trade shows and fashion weeks spotted new talent, and hence sourced around 90% of the newly listed product. Global designers could apply to be featured, but all designers had to uphold the \\"Designer Charter\\" in order to ensure quality of both product and customer service. By January 2011 Boticca was retailing independent designers from over 40 countries, including Estonia, Lebanon, South Korea the United Arab Emirates and Colombia. 155 of the 350 brands sold through the website led on jewelry, whilst the rest covered accessories such as bags, scarves, belts and hats. After the second round of fund raising, the company launched Boticca.fr in September 2013, making France the companies' third biggest market after the UK and United States. Awards The Independent rated it first in their 2014 survey of the top six jewelry retail websites.

Life It was once though that Thomas Dixon might have been the eponymous son of a nonconformist minister who was removed from the from the vicarage of Kelloe, County Durham in the Great Ejection of 1662. However, more recent studies consider this to be unlikely, although they do say that he was probably the son of an episcopalian. He was born at Ravenstonedale in the county of Westmorland around 1679/80. He studied at Manchester under John Chorlton and James Coningham, probably from 1700 to 1704, during which period he was for some time uncertain whether he should follow the path of nonconformism or that of the Church of England. He served briefly in the ministry at Colchester from 1704 but by October 1705 had succeeded Roger Anderton as minister of a dissenting congregation at Whitehaven that had been founded by Irish presbyterians. Dixon was a disciple of Richard Baxter. During his time at Whitehaven, when he was considered the leading nonconformist of the then county of Cumberland, he established a dissenting academy that concentrated mainly on the education of future ministers. It was certainly in operation by 1710, the year after he and his probable advisor in the venture, Edmund Calamy, had travelled together to Scotland, where in April Dixon had been awarded an honorary MA degree. In 1712, the academy gained the services of his former tutor, Coningham, who had left the similar institution in Manchester, and thereafter it had the reputation of being the leading nonconformist academy in the north of England, although it is possible that there was a hiatus in its operations as a consequence of the 1714 Schism Act. Dixon's status in the county enabled him to exert considerable influence in obtaining financial support for his students from the Presbyterian Fund Board. Among Dixon's academy pupils were John Taylor, George Benson the biblical critic, Caleb Rotheram of the Kendal Academy, and Henry Winder, author of the History of Knowledge. In 1722 or 1723, Dixon moved to the presbyterian meeting house at Bank Street in Bolton, Lancashire. Some sources say that he did so as the successor to Samuel Bourn but others note a two-year ministry of Peter Withington between those of Bourn and Dixon. He continued operation of his academy, which moved with him to Bolton. He also practised medicine in the town, having been awarded the medical degree of M.D. from King's College, Aberdeen in 1718. Dixon died at his Bank Street manse on 14 August 1729, aged 50, and was buried in his meeting house. A memorial tablet placed there by his one of his sons, Richard Dixon, described him as \\"facile medicorum et theologorum princeps\\" (easily chief among physicians and theologians). He had married Eleanor Stanger some time after obtaining a bond to do so on 21 September 1708; she was the daughter of an elder of the Cockermouth Independent Church. Family Thomas Dixon, son of the above, was born in Bolton on 16 July 1721, and educated for the ministry at Kendal Academy, which he entered in 1738. His studies there were funded by the Presbyterian Fund Board. His first settlement was at Thame, Oxfordshire, from 1743, on a salary of £25 a year. On 13 May 1750 he became assistant to Dr. John Taylor at Norwich. Here, at Taylor's suggestion, he began a Greek concordance, on the plan of Taylor's Hebrew one, but the manuscript fragments of the work show that not much was done. He found it difficult to satisfy the demands of a fastidious congregation, and gladly accepted, in August 1752, a call to his father's old flock at Bolton. He was not ordained till 26 April 1753. He was friends with John Seddon of Manchester, then the only Socinian preacher in the district, and is believed to have shared his views, although it is not evident in his published writings. He died on 23 February 1754, and was buried beside his father. Joshua Dobson of Cockey Moor preached his funeral sermon. His friend Seddon edited from his papers a posthumous tract, \\"The Sovereignty of the Divine Administration ... a Rational Account of our Blessed Saviour's Temptation, &c.;\\", a second edition of which was printed in 1766. In 1810, Charles Lloyd, in his Particulars of the Life of a Dissenting Minister (1813), recorded a long letter, dated \\"Norwich, 28 September 1751\\", addressed by Dixon to Leeson, travelling tutor to John Wilkes, and previously dissenting minister at Thame; from this Browne has extracted an account of the introduction of Methodism into Norwich.

History Music education developed in Israel largely due to the pioneering efforts of Shulamit Rupin, who established the first conservatory in Jaffa in 1910. Among the teachers were noted musicians such as Moshe Hupenko, a famous violinist from Geneva, invited from Europe for the express purpose of teaching at Shulamit. After Mrs. Ruppin’s passing, Mr. Hupenko took over as director, in which capacity he served for 40 years. The conservatory moved to Tel Aviv and became a focal point for residents there. At the time, 1,800 people lived in Tel Aviv and 37% of the city’s children studied at the conservatory. Among Shulamit Conservatory's most famous students are Itzhak Perlman, Pnina Salzman, Ivry Gitlis, Shimon Mishori, Yifrah Ne'eman, Yehoshua Epstein, Amichai Gross, Rami Bar-Niv, Varda Nishri and even former Prime Minister Moshe Sharett (Shertok). Famous musicians who taught at Shulamit include Paul Ben-Haim, Yoel Engel, Yosef Acharon, Yariv Ezrachi, and Telma Yelin. In 1923 the Shulamit Conservatory Orchestra accompanied Mordechai's Golinkin's production of La Traviata, the first opera performed in pre-state Israel.\\"The Jewish Community in Jaffe\\", Hanna Ram, 1996, Carmel Press Music schools sprouted all over the country to address the great demand produced by refugees who arrived during World War II. One of the more notable ones was Ron Conservatory, established and directed by the violinist Yariv Ezrachi, himself a graduate of the Shulamit Conservatory. Famous musicians who studied at Ron include Daniel Benyamini and Shlomo Mintz. In 1968 Ezrachi added the name “Shulamit” to the title of his school, in order to perpetuate Shulamit's illustrious history. Ezrahi's daughter Ofra Broshi later opened a branch in Jerusalem, and today the Ron Shulamit Conservatory operates a coed branch in Bet Hakerem, and one for orthodox girls in Har Nof., The Conservatory’s mission is to make music and all its benefits, available to everyone, regardless of religious/ethnic background, age, gender, socio- economic status, physical, mental or emotional disabilities. Working towards these aims, Ron Shulamit offers music classes of the highest caliber, by renowned musicians, for a wide variety of instruments, maintains several ensembles (wind, strings and baroque), and 3 orchestras. Their “Jewish Music Renaissance Project\\" researches, collects, records and performs traditional music pieces from Jewish communities around the globe. They provide music therapy to children with disabilities and emotional problems. Free open houses are held on a regular basis in addition to performances in nursing homes, community centers, fundraisers for charitable organizations and explained concerts in schools, as part of the goal of enriching the cultural life of Jerusalem residents. They offer early childhood music education, and a BA program in music education, for girls (the only program of its kind in the world) providing them with a higher education, and a career. The Conservatory employs many immigrant musicians, thereby aiding in their absorption process. Over 400 students train at the Conservatory each year, some going on to win awards for achievement in their field in national competitions., The performance groups include: “Zmora” – the only professional all female string orchestra in Israel recognized by the Ministry of Culture. Established in 2002, it has 15 musicians Educational concerts in schools, and benefit concerts for charity organizations, as well as free concerts in nursing homes and areas hurt by acts of terror, are all part of the orchestras unique contribution to the community, and beyond as Zmora performs in the cultural and geographical periphery. \\"AccordiRon” – A crowd favorite, this student accordion orchestra, is often invited to perform throughout the country. As part of the Jewish Music Renaissance Project, the AccordiRon repertoire continues to grow, and includes their own CD of Jewish folk music. “CameRon Student Orchestra” – Established in 1995 in an effort to bring people closer to classical music, this chamber orchestra performs a broad repertoire including pieces written specially for them by Israel Edelson and performed as part of the Jewish Music Renaissance Project. Students in the BA program have a chance to conduct the orchestra during rehearsals and performances, and occasionally play with the Zmora orchestra.

The Secretariats of the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the three leading global chemicals and waste management instruments, provide the measures, new initiatives and solutions to deal with the growing problems of hazardous chemicals and wastes. Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions encompass the management of hazardous chemicals, especially the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are covered by all three treaties. The Conventions target chemical pollutants like dioxins and furans, hazardous pesticides and DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), PFOS, and the heavy metals: arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead.  Objectives  Safe Planet supports the life-cycle approach to chemicals and waste management and is working towards finding the solutions to the challenges posed by toxic chemicals and wastes. The Campaign also seeks to involve people working at all levels of society in action against hazardous chemicals and wastes. Participants include Government, industry, educational institutions, community-led initiatives, grassroots organizations, individual households and consumers. The main goal of the Safe Planet Campaign is the pursuit of a safe and sustainable planet.  History  The Safe Planet Campaign was created in order to increase synergies among the three Conventions and to improve the cooperation and coordination of the management of chemicals at the global, regional and national levels. The Safe Planet Campaign was launched in February 2010 during the coinciding extraordinary meetings of the Conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, held back-to-back with the UNEP Governing Council meeting in Bali, Indonesia, at a special event – The United Nations Body Burden Forum. Since its launch, the Safe Planet Campaign has obtained partners around the world. The events and exhibits prepared for the Campaign have been covered by the mainstream and new social media. The participants collaborated in arts, culture, sports, science, education, business, and politics to motivate governments, industry, communities and individuals to respond to the need for action.  Events  = United Nations Body Burden Forum = The United Nations Body Burden Forum has introduced the Campaign’s flagship human biomonitoring project. This project exposed the presence in human bodies of hazardous chemicals covered by the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, for example persistent organic pollutants, pesticides and heavy metals. The first UN Body Burden Forum featured UN Messenger of Peace and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Professor Wangari Maathai and UN Under-Secretary General Jan Kubiš. The Campaign supporters, like American actor Bryan Cranston, Indonesian environment activist Yuyun Ismawati and Peter Kenmore, Co-Executive Secretary of the Rotterdam Convention, committed to undertake testing of their chemical body burdens. The second forum, the United Nations Champions Body Burden Forum, took place in New York in May 2010 at the 18th session of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Among the participants there were the American screen actor and eco-activist Ed Begley Jr. and Norwegian Olympic Gold Medalist Stine Lise Hattestad Bratsberg. = Safe Planet Films and Adventure at Sea = Body Burden and 5 Gyres are the first of a series of Safe Planet films. These films contributed to the elevation of awareness and spread of the idea of chemical body burden and plastic pollution of the oceans. The films carry the message that no one is immune from exposures to hazardous chemicals. They highlight how vulnerable communities face heightened risk of exposures to toxic chemicals and how action is needed to protect people and the planet. They also elevate awareness and support for the Global Monitoring Plan of the Stockholm Convention, which tracks levels of persistent organic pollutants in humans. The Sea Dragon, an NGO-led research vessel collecting plastic drift waste and fish samples from the oceans’ 5 gyres, has raised awareness of the 9 new POPs covered by the Stockholm Convention, protection of marine life and global food security. The expedition to the South Atlantic gyre landed in Cape Town, South Africa in early December and then set out of Montevideo, Uruguay in early January 2011. Mary Osborne, a professional surfer and model participating in the transatlantic voyage, announced her support for the Safe Planet Campaign at a press event at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town, South Africa. = Allies in the Animal Kingdom = The Campaign supports the efforts to redirect electrical and electronic waste – e-waste –away from environmentally unsound landfill, open-pit burning and harmful recycling operations. Safe Planet seeks to protect the environment and improve the health and welfare of workers in the informal sector as part of UNEP's efforts to build a global “Green Economy” of green jobs. In the 2010 International Year of Biodiversity, the Campaign’s slogan “A Planet Safe for All Living Things” served as a link of the chemicals and waste management to the protection of endangered species. The international project “We Help Gorillas” was launched by Prague Zoo as the Safe Planet project to foster mobile phone recycling and to raise awareness of the threats to gorilla populations living in Africa’s Congo Basin. This project spread to thirteen zoos in the Czech Republic and served as a model of public involvement in e-waste recycling, which is promoted by Safe Planet and the Basel Convention. = Visual and performing arts for a Safe Planet = The first Safe Planet exhibition, Substantialis Corporis Mixti (Substantial Form of the Blended Body): The Synergies Exhibition of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, took place at the Czech Center's Bohemian National Hall in New York City. It was held on the occasion of the 18th session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (May 2010). Ten artists from five countries presented works that questioned the sustainability of our current path while offering new perspectives on balancing humans´ relationship to the natural environment.http://www.pic.int/News/CSD18-Substantialis_programme_final.En.pdf WHAT WILL BE was the second exhibition that was curated for the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (November/December 2010), demonstrated the works of artists from the Czech Republic, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, UK and USA. The artworks contested the perceptions of hazardous chemicals and wastes.  Cooperation  The Safe Planet Campaign is collaborating with stakeholders that are cooperating on achieving sound chemicals and waste management. It works with: * Basel and Stockholm Convention regional centers * UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) * Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) * Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision- making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (UNECE Aarhus Convention) * Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer * UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) * UN Regional Commissions * UNEP and FAO regional and sub-regional offices * UNEP / DTIE Chemicals Branch * World Health Organization The Campaign cooperates with specific programmes and initiatives as well, including the Basel Wastes Solutions Circle, Green Customs Initiative, International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN), OzonAction, and Partnership for Action on Computing Equipment (PACE), PCBs Elimination Network (PEN), Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), as well as academic, business and community-based organizations.

There has been a church in this area, even if not on this precise location, since at least 1254, and 19th-century writers state that St Ffinan established the first church here in the 7th century. The church was rebuilt in 1841, reusing a 12th-century font and 18th-century memorials, as well as the cross at the eastern end of the roof. The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, one of eight in a combined parish, and services are held weekly. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is considered to be \\"a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style\\". The church is at the end of a gravel track in the countryside of central Anglesey, about from Llangefni, the county town. It is also on a footpath to Plas Penmynydd, once home to Owen Tudor, founder of the Tudor dynasty. History and location St Ffinan's Church is in the countryside in the centre of Anglesey, north Wales, near the village of Talwrn, and about away from Llangefni, the county town of Anglesey. The parish church is at the end of a gravelled track, off a country lane between the lower part of Talwrn and the hamlet of Ceint to the south. It can also be accessed by public footpath from Plas Penmynydd, once home to Owen Tudor, grandfather of King Henry VII and founder of the Tudor dynasty. The parish takes its name from the church: the Welsh word ' originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", with \\"-ffinan\\" denoting the saint. The date of construction of the first church in this area is uncertain, although a church was recorded here in 1254 during the Norwich Taxation of churches. The 19th-century writers and antiquarians Angharad Llwyd and Samuel Lewis said that St Ffinan, to whom the church is dedicated, established the first church here towards the beginning of the 7th century, possibly around 620. Llwyd described the old church in 1833 as \\"a small neat edifice\\". The current building was designed by the architect John Welch and erected in 1841, with the first service held on 6 July of that year. Welch also designed the church of St Nidan, Llanidan, in the south of Anglesey, which was built between 1839 and 1843. St Ffinan's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales. It is one of eight churches in a combined parish called Bro Cadwaladr. It is within the deanery of Synod Ynys Mon, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2016, the vicar is Emlyn Williams, assisted by an associate priest, E. R. Roberts. Williams was appointed in 2007; before that, the position had been vacant for 20 years despite many attempts by the Church in Wales to fill it. Services are held at St Ffinan's on the first to fourth Sundays of every month, either Cymun Bendigaid (Welsh: Holy Communion) or Foreol Weddi (Morning Prayer); on the fifth Sunday of the month, a service of Holy Communion is held at one of the churches in the parish. There are no midweek services. John Jones, who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727, was also rector of St Ffinan's during that time, as it was one of the benefices attached to the deanery. Jones is commememorated by a stone tablet on the wall of St Mary's Church, Pentraeth, also in Anglesey. The antiquarian Nicholas Owen was perpetual curate here from 1790 until his death in 1811; he is buried at St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog, Anglesey. Architecture and fittings The church is small and rectangular, built from stone with a slate roof; there is a bellcote at the west end of the roof. There is no internal structural division between the nave and the chancel. The style is Romanesque revival. There is a round- headed window in each of the three bays of the church, and a three-part window in the chancel. The doorway at the west end has small windows on either side, and a window above; a stone slab between the upper window and the doorway has \\"1841\\" upon it. Stained glass has been inserted into the windows in memory of parishioners. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a number of items that had been preserved from the old church. The circular font, made of gritstone, dates from the 12th-century; it has a \\"very crude interlacing strap ornament\\", and has been fitted upon a more modern base. There are two memorials from the 18th century, one dated 1705 to \\"Iohn Lloyd of Hirdre Faig\\" and one dated 1764 to \\"Hugh, son of Richard Hugh of Ty-hen\\". The churchyard contains one Commonwealth war grave from the First World War, of Private Evan Oswald Thomas, a Royal Welsh Fusiliers soldier from Talwrn. Assessment St Ffinan's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is considered to be \\"a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style\\". Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) describes it as \\"a small rural church\\". Samuel Lewis said that the new church was \\"a plain structure in the old English style, with strong buttresses, which have a good effect, being so well suited to the exposed situation of the building.\\" Writing in 1846, the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church, \\"a modern erection of the Pseudo-Norman style\\", stood in \\"a highly picturesque situation.\\" He said that the cross at the east end of the roof came from the old church. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region describes the 1841 rebuilding work as \\"rectangular and harsh\\". A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that it is \\"a good example of the small rural church\\", set in a \\"well-maintained churchyard\\". It also notes that its style \\"is quite different to most Anglesey churches\\".

Wildlife watching is a popular tourist attraction, as the territory is home to a number of wildlife and bird sanctuaries. It is possible to spot walrus, polar bears, a large variety of birds and belugas throughout Nunavut. Outdoor adventure activities are also popular. Nunavut has a wide and lengthy river system, meaning that there are a large number of canoeing and kayaking opportunities to suit experienced travellers. Nunavut's vast expanse of uninhabited territory offers many opportunities for hiking and camping. However, the region's often extreme conditions and remote location often necessitates a guide, even for experienced campers. Nunavut Tourism does not regularly publish tourism statistics. However, an exit survey conducted by the Department of Economic Development and Transportation between June and October 2008 revealed that 33,378 people visited Nunavut during that period, up from 28,802 in June–October 2006. The vast majority of visitors to Nunavut are Canadian, with 96% of travellers arriving from Canada. However, the leisure travel market is not as dominated by Canadian visitors, with 28% of foreign visitors.  Attractions  Coast of the Remote Peninsula in Sam Ford Fjord in northeast Baffin Island Nunavut features a number of outdoor adventure activity opportunities as a result of the territory's vast uninhabited area. Wildlife watching is one particularly popular activity - the territory is home to walrus and belugas, as well as eleven bird sanctuaries housing millions of birds. Muskox are also spread throughout Nunavut, although the territory's tourism authority does not promote 'muskox watching' trips specifically. The territory is also home to a population of polar bears, and trips designed to increase tourists' chances of spotting a polar bear are common. A number of private operators offer wildlife, bird, polar and whale watching tours, in addition to other activities. Other popular activities for tourists in Nunavut involve the Canadian territory's vast opportunities for adventuring. Canoeing and kayaking are possible on the territory's lengthy rivers, with the Thelon River being the most famous of these. This river is most popular during summer - despite not having road access direct to the river, many visitors participate in kayaking or canoeing along the river each year, as it is not as difficult to navigate as some of the other rivers in Nunavut. Another popular outdoor adventure activity is hiking. Nunavut Tourism promotes Nunavut as having a number of short and long hikes available to tourists, with camping possible in the middle of \\"caribou birthing grounds... [and at Whale Cove,] at the river, teeming with chirping white whales.\\" However, due to Nunavut's rugged terrain and often extreme conditions, Nunavut Tourism recommends the use of a guide for all campers and hikers staying the night outdoors to enhance safety. One tourism activity unique to the Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, it is possible to watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.  Statistics  An inukshuk at sunset. Nunavut Tourism did not, as of 2002, produce detailed statistics about tourism numbers, trends and characteristics. However, by 2010, this appeared to have changed, with Nunavut Tourism providing media outlets with general figures on trends in tourism in Nunavut. Tourism brings approximately CAD $30 million to Nunavut's economy each year according to Nunavut Tourism, with one in five of its tourists arriving on cruise ships. Between June and October 2008, 33,378 people visited Nunavut by air and sea, according to the territory's Department of Economic Development and Transportation. This is an almost 16 percent increase on the number of people who visited Nunavut by air and sea during the same period in 2006, which was 28,802 people. The average age of people arriving in Nunavut was 46 during the period in 2008 that the Department of Economic Development and Transportation conducted its survey, and the majority of visitors were in the territory for business purposes. 96 percent of all business travellers entering the territory were domestic travellers (Canadian residents). However, among the leisure traveller sub-group, the proportion of domestic travellers declines - Canadians make up only 72 percent of the leisure traveller arrival numbers, with travellers from the United States (20 percent) and other countries (8 percent) making up the difference. September and July account for 46 percent of arrivals, making them the busiest arrival months. The most popular tourist destination among arrivals to Nunavut was Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin Island), home to the territory's capital, Iqaluit. Visitors to Baffin Island comprised 63 percent of all travellers to Nunavut. 11 percent visited the Kivalliq Region, seven percent travelled to the Kitikmeot Region and the remainder were cruise ship passengers who visited a number of Nunavut towns during their journeys. 76 percent of visitors to the Kivalliq Region travelled for business, leisure tourism was the most popular reason given for travel to the Kitikmeot Region, and visiting friends and family was the most popular reason given for travel to Baffin Island. 21 cruise ships visited Nunavut communities in 2009.  Market issues  In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism publication The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for Tourism Development in Nunavut, a number of issues facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth. A number of governmental and human resource issues also exist. Employees in the tourism industry are often poorly trained and tourism operators also face high staff turnover. A lack of interest in tourism development also exists in many Nunavut governmental organisations as well as in the private sector, and a policy put in place to prevent \\"market disruption\\" by new businesses has led to many businesses being denied licences to operate due to the new competition they would bring to the market. This policy has not only acted to the detriment of competition in the tourism sector but has also limited the opportunities for industry growth. Finally, a lack of in-depth and relevant statistics about trends and growth in tourism in Nunavut has prevented businesses from planning for their short- and long-term futures.

Retrieved 19 Jan 2017. He was one of the most important of Karl Friedrich Schinkel's pupils and is regarded as a representative of the Schinkel school. Soller became an influential proponent of , a Romanesque revival architectural style that became popular in German-speaking lands and among German diaspora during the 19th century.  Life and work  August Soller was born in Erfurt, Principality of Erfurt, in 1805. He worked as a land surveyor from 1820–1822 and completed his surveyor's examination on June 22, 1822 at the E. S. Unger Mathematical Institute. Soller then completed two and a half years of practical experience as a building inspector. To prepare for his master builder's examination, he moved to Berlin and lived with the family of his nephew Richard Lucae. The in Berlin, where Soller studied under Karl Schinkel In 1829 Soller was licensed as a Prussian state architect. He then served in the provinces, particularly in the Province of Silesia. From 1830 to 1833 he worked as a royal construction foreman for the District Government in Liegnitz and for a time served as a construction inspector in Posen. His focus became the design of churches and the supervision of their construction. On June 1, 1833, he became a master builder for the Prussian Higher Council of Architecture () in Berlin and also became a member of the Berlin Academy of Architecture, known as the . During this period Soller was assistant to Karl Friedrich Schinkel, one of the most prominent architects in Germany. Soller took over the Department of Churches in the Construction Commission in 1841, and in 1843 was made Senior Privy Councillor () for Infrastructure. From 1851 onwards he served as Lead Councillor for construction in the Prussian Ministry of Trade. His first completely independent work was the nearly three meter high tomb of General Ernst Ludwig von Tippelskirch in the ) in Berlin (1844). Soller also designed Berlin's second oldest Catholic Church constructed after the Reformation, the almost forgotten church St. Marien am Behnitz in Spandau (1848). In 2002 that church was transferred into private ownership and completely renovated. He led construction of the war monument in Berlin's (1851–1853) and designed the tower of the Luisenstädtische Kirche. As a curator of monuments, Soller was also involved in the construction of Cologne Cathedral and the restoration of Erfurt Cathedral and the Cathedral of Trier. St. Michael's Church, Berlin in 1880 Soller's most important work is St. Michael's Church, Berlin (), the parish church of St. Michael and the city's third oldest Catholic church built after the Reformation. It was constructed between 1851–1861 to plans Soller had already completed in 1845 and occupies a dramatic position on the Luisenstadt Canal. After his early death in 1853, church financial difficulties then caused a break in construction in 1855.\\"Geschichte der St. Michael Kirche\\" (in German). Der Förderverein zur Erhaltung der Katholischen Kirche St. Michael (Foundation for the Preservation of the Catholic Church of St. Michael's). Retrieved 19 Jan 2017. Soller was buried there in 1856 and the building was finally completed in 1861 by Andreas Simons, Martin Gropius and particularly Soller's nephew, Richard Lucae. The church was consecrated on the 28 October 1861, by the Bishop of Breslau in the presence of the King of Prussia, William I, the future Emperor of Germany.  Legacy  St. Michael's Church, Berlin, showing partially restored damage from World War II Since his health was poor and he died at only 48 years old, Soller's oeuvre is not as extensive as it might have been. His designs for the spire of the (1837) and the (1844), for instance, were never carried out. However, he is regarded as the best among the state architects of the period. He sought neither fame nor honors, instead dedicating himself to principles of sound architectural design. As Soller's work became known through publications, it influenced American architects Richard M. Upjohn and James Renwick Jr. in the mid-1840s, effectively initiating a Romanesque revival in the United States. Soller's work also influenced Miklós Ybl, one of Europe's leading architects and Hungary's most influential during the mid to late 19th century. A number of Soller's significant works were damaged in World War II and demolished in its aftermath. St. Michael's was heavily damaged on the night of Feb 3, 1945 during the bombing of Berlin. It was stabilized and partially restored between 1948 and 1953, with the installation of a worship space in the transept. More repair and restoration work continued between 1976 and 1998, although the front façade and nave remain a ruin. The survived the war without significant damage, but it became overshadowed by more pressing events surrounding the Berlin Blockade. It was demolished by the city on August 19, 1948. The Luisenstädtische Kirche burnt during the bombings of February 3, 1945, with Soller's west tower still standing. However, by 1961 the church's ruins were located in the boundary strip of the Berlin Wall and it too was demolished in 1964.

It had been legally engaged in the African slave trade under the flag of Spain when it was taken over by a privateer at Cabinda. The legal case on the fate of the captured Africans, known as The Antelope, lasted for seven years, with some of the Africans being turned over as slaves to Spanish owners, while 120 were sent as free people to Liberia. Both the commandeering of the boat, as well as the ensuing trial, are the subject of the book Dark Places of the Earth, by Jonathan M. Bryant. End of slave trade The importation of slaves into the United States became illegal in 1808, under the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. That act did not include any effective penalties for violation, and did not specify what was to be done with illegally imported slaves. In practice, each state auctioned off such slaves and kept the proceeds. In 1819 the Act in Addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade gave the President authority to use U.S. Navy and other armed ships to capture slave ships, and to see to the \\"safe-keeping, support and removal beyond the United States\\" of any Africans found on captured slave ships.Noonan: 17-19 The ships Antelope was a ship of a little more than 112 tons burthen built in Freeport, Maine, in 1802. In 1809 she was sold to a foreign owner, and in 1819 she passed to a Spanish owner in Cadiz, who renamed her Fenix. The new owner of Antelope was licensed in August 1819 by the Spanish government of Cuba to trade for new slaves from Africa. In early March 1820 Antelope was at Cabinda loading African slaves when a privateer flying the flag of an unspecified Latin American republic (several of which were then rebelling against Spanish rule) accosted Antelope and seized goods and supplies and the best of the slaves from the ship. After the privateer left, Antelope resumed loading slaves.Noonan: 13-14, 29 A hermaphrodite brig of a little less than 200 tons burthen named Baltimore, under the flag of the Venezuelan revolutionary Luis Brión, arrived in Baltimore in 1819. In December 1819 the ship, now named Columbia, sailed from Baltimore under a letter of marque issued by the Uruguayan revolutionary José Gervasio Artigas. The crew of Columbia had all sworn that they were not citizens of the United States, but a United States Revenue-Marine cutter removed four of the crewmen as U.S. citizens before escorting the ship out to sea. Once at sea the ship's name was changed to Arraganta.Noonan: 4, 26-27 Arraganta boarded or chased American, British and Spanish ships on the way to Africa. In early 1820 Arraganta encountered the American registered brig Exchange, out of Bristol, Rhode Island, and seized at least 25 Africans that it was carrying. On March 23, 1820, Arraganta arrived at Cabinda, where it found Antelope and three ships flying the Portuguese flag, all loading African slaves. The crew of Arraganta captured the four ships, and loaded the Africans from the Portuguese ships onto Arraganta and Antelope.Noonan: 27-29 Antelope was renamed General Ramirez, and together with Arraganta sailed to Brazil, where Arraganta wrecked on the coast. Some of the crew and captive Africans on Arraganta were drowned or captured. The rest of the survivors were taken aboard Antelope, which sailed to Dutch Surinam, where the crew of Antelope tried unsuccessfully to sell the Africans, and then to Swedish St. Bartholomew, where the unarmed Antelope obtained cannon and supplies. Antelope then sailed to Florida (which was still Spanish at the time), loitering near St. Augustine while flying the American flag. Word of a suspicious ship reached St. Marys, Georgia, and the revenue cutter sailed in search of it. Dallas found Antelope sailing north near Amelia Island on June 29, 1820, and stopped it.Noonan: 28-30, 31 The first mate of Dallas counted 281 living Africans, and two bodies, on Antelope. Noting that the crew were all English-speaking, and not satisfied with the explanations offered for the presence of Antelope in the area, Dallas arrested the captain and crew, and took the ship and its cargo to St. Marys. Crew, ship, and the Africans aboard it were subsequently moved to Savannah, Georgia. Richard W. Habersham, the United States District Attorney for Georgia, reported on July 19 that there were \\"about 270\\" Africans (nine of the Africans had died before reaching Savannah). The Africans were placed in the custody of John Morel, United States Marshall for the District of Georgia. Morel reported in early August that he had received 258 Africans. No explanation for the discrepancy was offered. Marshall Morel confined the Africans in an open area at the Savannah race course, which became known as the \\"African encampment\\".Noonan: 31-32, 45 Aftermath John Smith, former first mate of Arraganta and captain of Antelope after she was captured by the privateer, was prosecuted for piracy, but acquitted. He then filed a claim for the return of Antelope and her cargo as a legitimate prize taken by a licensed privateer. Claims for ownership of the Africans were filed on behalf of the Kings of Portugal and Spain, while Richard Habersham filed a claim to place the Africans, as free persons under the provisions of the 1819 Act in Addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade, into the custody of the United States.Noonan: 32-33, 43, 44, 46, 53 The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court in 1825. Francis Scott Key had urged it to take the case and argued on behalf of the United States government that all the captives should be freed and returned to Africa. The justices partly agreed with Key and Attorney General William Wirt and rejected the claims of John Smith and the King of Portugal.The Antelope, 23 U.S. 66 (1825) However, four justices were also slaveowners and awarded some of the Africans as slaves to Spanish owners. Chief Justice John Marshall remarked that the international slave trade, while against the law of nature, was not piracy nor contrary to international law of the day. The highest American court ultimately found ownership had only been established for 93 captives, and so directed that 120 be returned to Africa.Bryant, Dark Places of the Earth, pp.227-239 The 120 freed Africans were sent to Liberia in July 1827, where they founded the colony of New Georgia.

It sailed in December 1942, reaching the Soviet northern ports at the end of the month. JW 51A was not detected or attacked by German forces and arrived without loss. Background JW 51A was the first of the JW/RA convoy series, replacing the previous PQ/QP series which had been suspended during the summer and autumn of 1942. The JW series were organized to sail from Loch Ewe, Scotland, rather than Iceland, as previously, and sailed with a substantial destroyer escort to guard against surface attacks, as had proved effective with PQ 18. JW 51A was the first outbound Arctic convoy of the 1942–43 winter season, and began the practice of sailing smaller convoys twice-monthly during the winter months to reduce the problems of controlling large groups of ships in the gloom of the polar night. Forces JW 51A consisted of 16 merchant ships, which departed from Loch Ewe on 15 December 1942.Ruegg, Hague p48 Close escort was provided by the minesweeper Seagull, two corvettes and two armed trawlers. These were supported by six Home Fleet destroyers led by Faulknor. The convoy was also accompanied initially by a local escort group from Britain. A cruiser cover force comprising Jamaica and Sheffield, and three destroyers, also followed the convoy to guard against attack by surface units. Distant cover was provided by a Heavy Cover Force comprising the battleship King George V, the cruiser Berwick and three escorting destroyers. JW 51A was opposed by a force of three U-boats in a patrol line in the Norwegian Sea, and the aircraft of Luftflotte V based in Norway.Blair p152 A surface force comprising the heavy cruisers Hipper, Lützow and six destroyers was also available, stationed at Altenfjord. Voyage JW 51A departed Loch Ewe on 15 December 1942, accompanied by its local escort, of three destroyers, and its close escort. Three days later, on 18 December, it was joined by the ocean escort, while the local escort departed. At the same time the Cruiser Force and the Distant Cover Force from Scapa Flow also put to sea, taking station in the Norwegian Sea. The convoy was not sighted by German reconnaissance aircraft, nor by any of the patrolling U-boats, and crossed the Norwegian and Barents Seas without incident. On 25 December JW 51A arrived safely at Kola Inlet.

The church is located some southeast of Stowmarket on the west side of the B1113 road, and is approached by a track about a mile long. History The oldest fabric in the church dates from about 1200, although most of it was built in the 15th century. The roofs date from the early 16th century, and the top stage of the tower was rebuilt during that century. The south porch was added in the 14th century, but it was largely rebuilt in the 20th century. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed mainly in flint rubble, with the south and east sides rendered. The tower is in flint and brick rubble, with the top stage in orange brick. The dressings are in freestone. The roofs are tiled. The plan of the church consists of a nave with a south porch, a chancel and a west tower. The south doorway dates from about 1200. Most of the windows are from the 15th century and have three lights, although the west window is large with five lights, and there is a lancet window dating from about 1200 in the north chancel wall. =Interior= The font dates from the 13th century and is made in Purbeck marble. It has an octagonal bowl and a 17th-century oak cover with an acorn finial. The pews date from the 15th to the 17th century. Most of them are from the 16th century, although there is a bench from the 15th century with animals carved on its buttresses.

Google Cloud Print is listed as a printer option in the Print Preview page of Google's Web browser, Google Chrome, in Chrome 16 and higher. Printers without built-in Cloud Print support, often referred to as \\"legacy\\" or \\"classic\\", are supported through a \\"Cloud Print Connector\\" integrated with Google Chrome versions 9 and higher.  History  Google introduced Cloud Print in April 2010, as a future solution for printing from Chrome OS. They made the design document and a preliminary version of the source code available. Google Cloud Print reached beta stage on 25 January 2011. Applications print through a web-based, common print dialog (web UI) or an API. The service forwards the job to a printer registered to the service. Cloud Ready printers (which connect directly to the web and do not require a computer to set up) can directly connect to Google Cloud Print. As legacy (\\"classic\\") printers cannot accept input from a cloud service, Google Chrome 9 contained a \\"Cloud Print Connector\\"—which lets printers plugged into a Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or Linux computer with Internet access use Cloud Print while the connector is running in Google Chrome. Printing through Google Cloud Print from any instance of Google Chrome was enabled in Google Chrome 16. Since December 2014, Google Cloud Print lets users share printers in a manner similar to Google Docs. In July 2013, Google updated the service to allow printing from any Windows application if Google Cloud Printer is installed on the machine. The Google Cloud Print Service can run as a Windows service, so legacy printers can connect to Google Cloud Print. Google Cloud Print 2.0, not supported by some printers that support v 1.0, adds support for a local mode similar in operation to Apple's AirPrint. Unlike the earlier version of Cloud Print, v 2.0 does not require either the printer or printing client to be connected to the Internet. Local mode uses a discovery protocol called Privet, which uses Multicast DNS and DNS-SD for discovery, and HTTPS for transmitting print jobs to the printer. Clients supporting this mode only list printers that are discoverable on the same subnet the device is connected to, and forget the printers once disconnected from that subnet. Planned discontinuation Announced by Google in November 2019, Google Cloud Print will no longer be supported after December 31, 2020.

The industry reached its peak in the two periods when the Weald was the main iron-producing region of Britain, namely in the first 200 years of the Roman occupation (1st to 3rd centuries AD) and during Tudor and early Stuart times. Iron-smelting in the former period was based on bloomery technology, while the latter depended for its rapid growth on the blast furnace, when the Ashdown area became the first in England to use this technology. The Forest was a particularly favourable location for iron production because of the presence of iron-ore in the local geology of sandstone Ashdown Beds and overlying Wadhurst Clay, the availability of large expanses of woodland for the production of charcoal, and deep, steep-sided valleys that had been incised into the relatively soft sandstone which together with locally high rainfall made it practical to dam streams to form lakes to provide water power for furnaces and forges. Iron Age and Roman Period When the Romans invaded Britain in AD 43 the Weald already had a well-established tradition of iron-making, using very small, clay bloomery furnaces for iron-smelting. The pre-Roman settlement pattern was one of sparse occupation based on major defended enclosures along the northern edge of the High Weald with smaller enclosures deeper within it, such as the hill-fort at Garden Hill. The association of these smaller enclosures with iron-making and other evidence suggest that Iron Age colonizers saw the Weald primarily as a source of iron.Cleere (1978) The Romans also saw the Weald's economic potential for iron-making and with growing markets in south-east England generated by the building of towns, villas and farms the industry grew, achieving high levels of output at its peak. There is evidence in Ashdown Forest of Roman bloomeries at Garden Hill, Pippingford Park and elsewhere. Like other sites in the western Weald, these are thought to have been private, commercial operations set up by entrepreneurs to produce iron goods for nearby civilian markets. This was in contrast to Roman iron production in the eastern Weald, which is thought to have been state- controlled and linked to the needs of the British Fleet, the Classis Britannica, and which may have been an Imperial Estate.Salway, Peter (1981), Roman Britain, pp. 637-638. The transition from Late Iron Age to Roman Era iron production in the Forest, as elsewhere in the Weald, may have been quite smooth. Bloomery production was already well-established and this southern coastal region of Britain had already become Romanised prior to the invasion of AD 43. It has been suggested that the poorly built Roman-era bath building at Garden Hill may indicate continuity of indigenous community and activity, and a desire to indulge in a more Romanised way of life.Leslie and Short (1999), p.22. Oliver Rackham has highlighted the impact that the Romans' sophisticated woodmanship, including coppicing, which they practised in Italy, would have had on the Wealden forest in supplying the Roman military iron works there. Using Henry Cleere's estimates that the output of one Roman ironworks in the Weald would be 550 tonnes a year for 120 years, Rackham calculates that it could have been sustained permanently by the charcoal produced by 23,000 acres of coppice wood. He points out that there were many Roman ironworks in the Weald (at least 113 ironworking sites in the Weald have been dated to the Roman period, though of these 20 or less very big sites accounted for the majority of production);Hodgkinson (2008), p.31. clearly, in this respect alone, the Wealden forest the Saxons found was not a virgin forest, but one already affected by human activity.Rackham (1986), p.74. The trunk road between London and Lewes, partly metalled with iron slag from local bloomeries, would have served to carry the Forest's iron products to the Roman province's pre-eminent mercantile centre at London, and the densely populated agricultural areas of the South Downs and the coastal plain around Chichester. It is likely that the iron goods transported to London and elsewhere took the form of semi-finished products; these would then have been worked into finished products for onward distribution, including overseas. Although the Roman iron industry flourished from the invasion to the mid 3rd century, it then declined until there was very little activity at all during the 4th century. Saxon Period During the period between the departure of the Romans in the early 5th century AD and the Norman Conquest iron-making in the forest - as in the Weald as a whole - seems to have taken place on only a very small scale, judging from the lack of material evidence. A primitive Middle Saxon iron-smelting furnace at Millbrook, near Nutley, which operated in the 9th century, is the only furnace from the Saxon period to have been found in the entire Weald.Tebbutt (1982)Hodgkinson (2008), p.35. Tudor and Stuart Period The local iron industry underwent a massive resurgence in Tudor and early Stuart times as a result of the introduction of the blast furnace from northern France. Blast furnaces were much larger and more permanent structures than bloomeries, and produced much greater quantities of iron. They correspondingly made much greater demands on local resources, in particular wood, iron ore and water (to operate the bellows and forges in what was now a two-stage smelting and forging process). Because of the huge demand for water, they were generally located in deep valleys where streams could be dammed to provide a sufficient, consistent flow. Such resources were things that Ashdown Forest and the surrounding area possessed in abundance. Ashdown Forest became the site of Britain's second blast furnace when the works at Newbridge, south of Coleman's Hatch at the foot of Kidd's Hill, began operation in 1496. (Britain's earliest known blast furnace, a few miles away at Queenstock, Buxted, began operation at the end of 1490). The Newbridge furnace, constructed at the commission of Henry VII for the production of heavy metalwork for gun carriages for his war against the Scots, was designed and initially run by French immigrants.Hodgkinson (2008) p.63 et seq. The Crown's involvement with Newbridge continued until a replacement, larger furnace was built in 1539 on the western edge of Ashdown Forest at Stumbles. Other works set up around this time in or near the Forest include a steel forge at Pippingford Park, around 1505, and a furnace and forge at Parrock, Hartfield, in 1513. Unfortunately, there is little visible trace of any of these sites today but it is possible to visit the site of Newbridge furnace, off Kidd's Hill, where there is an information board, and to see a number of identifiable features. The industry grew very rapidly in Ashdown Forest and elsewhere in the High Weald during the 16th century. The area became particularly noted for the casting of cannons for the British navy. The iron-master and gun founder Ralph Hogge, who in 1543 had cast the first iron cannon in England at Buxted, drew his raw materials from the southern part of the forest. The rapid expansion of the iron industry and its huge demand for raw materials, particularly the cutting of trees for making charcoal, is likely to have had a major early impact on Ashdown Forest by depleting its woodlands, although it is likely that in due course production of wood through coppice management, in common with the practice generally in the High Weald, will have been required to ensure a more sustainable supply. The industry declined in the 17th century as a result of competition from lower-cost and higher productivity iron- producing areas in England and overseas, particularly Sweden.

The album captured Billboard's 'Hot Shot Debut\\" honor and charted in the United States at #165 on the Billboard 200. Twist of Shadows launched several charting singles in the United States. In March 1989 \\"Obsession\\" shot up to #16 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart. By June 1989 it had also reached #12 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs (also known as Club Play Singles, and formerly known as Hot Dance Club Play). The second single, \\"Blind Hearts\\", reached #9 on the Dance Music/Club Play chart. The third single taken from the album, \\"Imagination\\" (with Anka Wolbert on lead vocals) reached #85 on Billboard Hot 100 and remains Xymox's biggest commercial success to date. Songwriting credits Contrary to official songwriting credits (see Track listing below), lead singer and frontman Ronny Moorings told Premonition in a 2003 interview that he allegedly \\"always wrote the music and the words [him]self since the beginning of Clan Of Xymox in 1984\\". Pieter Nooten, who last contributed to Xymox with the next album, said differently in 2010 that the members of the band had from the start collaborated in songwriting, with Moorings contributing guitar, keyboards and lyrics; Nooten specifically claimed credit for composing Twist's \\"Clementina\\". Furthermore, the song bears striking resemblance to one of Nooten's other pieces, specifically a B-side \\"Promises\\" also released from this album. Also in 2010, Bert Barten claimed to have shared authorship for songs on Twist of Shadows, asserting \\"It was always a big grey area who wrote what and who inspired who. All the members even the manager at that time used to fight a lot about things like this.\\" Anka Wolbert reflected in an interview in 2005: \\"The 'old' Xymox was always a combination and working together of three individuals: Ronny, Pieter Nooten, and myself. To me, Xymox was never one of them by themselves, and I consistently believed in the strength of the artistic combination of us three. There was a magical energy between us which resulted in some great music.\\" Reception According to SPIN, Twist of Shadows signified the most sophisticated stage in the band's gradual evolution from arty obscurity into pop accessibility. Billboard claimed the album, along with the followup Phoenix (1991), had lifted the band to cult status in the United States. The album had mixed reviews. While SPIN praised the album and called it \\"still ethereal, big and foreboding\\", Trouser Press found the album \\"easily endurable\\" but labeled the band \\"just another lightweight electronic dance band of the post-romantic era\\". Although Twist of Shadows wasn't exactly considered industrial in its sound, the bpm's run mid-tempo and sound made it totally danceable in a New Order-ish way. The Great Indie Discography found the album \\"decidedly dated...stuck in a mid-80s groove\\", while the St. Petersburg Times looked back at Twist of Shadows as \\"brilliant...[w]ith a dense, almost Gothic sound that borrowed as heavily from Pink Floyd as it did modern techno-popsters\\".

The area was begun as a thoroughbred horse ranch by New Yorker Francis Morris in 1856, and the town grew up around it. In 1962, the school district was merged with Fredericksburg Independent School District, and the Morris Ranch school ceased operations. The Morris Ranch school was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1980, Marker number 10086. The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Texas, on March 29, 1983, NRHP Reference #:83003142. Thoroughbred ranch In 1856, New York City broker Francis Morris bought of land in Gillespie and Kerr counties for twenty-five cents an acre. He eventually sold off all but , and hired his nephew Charles Morris to manage the acreage for horse breeding. Charles was ranch manager until 1910. Francis Morris died in 1886. The land was inherited by his son John A. Morris, who spent $500,000 on capital improvements and converted the property into a community dedicated to the business of raising thoroughbred horses. The improvements included a hotel for entertaining influential and important individuals, a general store and post office, a school, a cotton gin, and a flour mill. Approximately 200 mares and ten stallions were at the ranch, with yearling colts either being sold or boarded at the Morris stables in Winchester Park, Maryland. Adjacent to the ranch was a racetrack and living quarters for the jockeys, where Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse trainer Max Hirsch got his start. Anti-gambling legislation passed by in the 1890s by the New Jersey Legislature and the Hart–Agnew Law in 1908 by the New York State Legislature caused the horse racing industry to go into decline, and Morris Ranch along with it. The ranch was inherited by John's sons Alfred and David and eventually by Alfred's son Captain John A. Morris. Township Clayton Morris succeeded Charles Morris as manager, and in 1902 sold the horses and subdivided the ranch into tenant cotton farms. Clayton's son Reginald inherited the ranch from his father, but it was no longer a vital business. Although some of the original buildings were still standing in the year 2000, the population began a decline after the subdivision happened. By 1968, no population was listed. When the Morris Ranch post office opened in 1893, Guy D. Anderson was the first postmaster. He was succeeded by Charles Morris in 1894, who was subsequently succeeded by Clayton Morris in 1910. Clayton Morris served as postmaster until the post office closed in 1954 when the Morris Ranch store was shut down. The town has been the subject of a ghost story involving the death of Morris Ranch resident Mary Elizabeth Simmons Byrd in 1948.

Ashdown Forest contains a wealth of archeological features. Absence of ploughing, predominance of heathland and lack of building development have allowed archaeological sites to survive and remain visible. More than 570 such sites have been identified, including Bronze Age round barrows, Iron Age enclosures, prehistoric field systems, iron workings from Roman times onwards, the Pale, medieval and post-medieval pillow mounds for the rearing of rabbits, and a set of military kitchen mounds between Camp Hill and Nutley dating from 1793 that are among the only surviving ones in the United Kingdom.Ashdown Forest Life, Issue 8, Autumn/Winter 2009 The earliest known trace of human activity in Ashdown Forest is a stone hand axe found near Gills Lap, which is thought to be about 50,000 years old.Ashdown Forest The vast majority of finds however date from the Mesolithic (11,000-7,000 BP) and onwards into the modern era. Cultural remains =Stone age= Occasional stone tools remain as evidence of an early culture. =Bronze age= Burial mounds, round barrows, are among the features still extant from the Bronze Age. =Iron age= The late pre-Roman Iron Age (100 BC to AD 43) saw a conspicuous reconfiguration of the settlement and economic geography of Sussex, of which one aspect was the disappearance of hill-forts from the South Downs (except Devil's Dyke) and the establishment of hill-forts in the High Weald, including one in Ashdown Forest at Garden Hill (see below).Money (1978), p.38. Three other hill-forts lie in close proximity at Philpots, Saxonbury and Dry Hill. The general consensus is that these hill-forts are associated with a more intensive exploitation of the iron resources of the Weald.Leslie and Short (1999) p.22 This period also presents the first evidence for centralised ceramic production, with specialist pottery sites identified at Chelwood Gate and Horsted Keynes, both situated close to the Forest and ideally located to exploit the local potting clays. Elsewhere in Ashdown Forest there is evidence of Iron Age enclosures at Gills Lap, marked by a roundel of fir trees, and King's Standing, both situated on high hilltops.Christian (1967), p.7. Another site, at Chelwood Gate, known as Danes Graves, shows evidence of late pre- Roman Iron Age iron working. Garden Hill site Garden Hill, situated on a hill spur south of Colemans Hatch Road, is Ashdown Forest's most important scheduled ancient monument, containing both an Iron Age hill-fort and the remains of an important Romano-British iron-working centre.Money & Streeten (date unknown) In 1972 archaeologists uncovered a small but complete 2nd century AD Romano-British stone-built bath-house. Subsequent excavations produced evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age and early pre-Roman occupation of the hill-top and uncovered remains of a late pre-Roman Iron Age and Romano- British iron-working settlement of the 1st, 2nd and early 3rd centuries AD. This included pre-Roman round houses, a rectangular 2nd-century Roman timber villa to which the bath building was attached, and an almost complete pane of Roman window-glass that was later acquired by the British Museum. Both iron- making (ore roasting and smelting) and iron-working (forging) were conducted, but this is likely to have been small in scale. Later the industrial workings were levelled and replaced by the villa and other buildings of a non- industrial character, suggesting that the settlement may have operated through the 2nd century more as a managerial centre for other iron-working sites nearby, such as the small early 1st-century bloomeries at Pippingford Park and Cow Park before probably becoming abandoned by the mid 3rd century. Garden Hill lies within the Ministry of Defence's Pippingford Park military training area and is not open to the public. Roman roads and pre-Roman trackways The London to Lewes Way, one of three Roman roads that connected London with the important Wealden iron industry, crosses Ashdown Forest in a north-south direction. The road ran in a direct line from its junction with Watling Street at Peckham in London to the South Downs on the east side of Lewes, from where it connected with routes to the densely populated corn-growing areas of the South Downs and coastal plain, and possibly to ports trading with Roman- occupied Gaul. The main purpose of the road, apart from linking the corn- growing areas with London, was to open up Ashdown Forest and neighbouring iron-producing areas for the export of iron products to London and Gaul. Given the great importance of the iron industry to the Romans, it is likely that the road was built soon after the Roman occupation, not long after AD 100 or possibly earlier.Margary (1965), p.124. After crossing the Greensand Ridge the road runs virtually straight from Marlpit Hill southwards for , entering Ashdown Forest near Chuck Hatch, reaching the top of the forest at Camp Hill, and then leaving the Forest via Duddleswell and Fairwarp. The agger varies in width (at Camp Hill it is wide, at Five Hundred Acre Wood, wideMargary (1965), p.159.) and is metalled with compacted sandstone lumps and iron slag from local bloomeries. Unusually, side ditches apart run continuously for two miles (3 km) through the forest.Margary (1965), p.154. The remains of the road in the Forest were partly obliterated by tanks undertaking training exercises in World War II, but part of it is clearly marked out at Roman Road car park. A secondary Roman road which passed through Wych Cross and Colemans Hatch reached the London-Lewes trunk road at Gallypot Street, Hartfield, and would probably have served to link the Romano-British iron-working complex at Garden Hill to the main road. The north-south London-Lewes Roman road superseded an older trackway that ran from Titsey, at the foot of the Greensand Ridge, through the iron-age hillfort at Dry Hill, Forest Row, Danehill and Wivelsfield to Westmeston, at the foot of the South Downs. Across the Weald ran many old, broadly east-west trackways that followed the relatively lightly wooded high sandy ridges. Some of these, particularly in iron-producing areas, would have formed part of the road network used by the Romans.Margary (1965) p.258. Among the important trackways that crossed Ashdown Forest were ridgeways from Crowborough and Nutley that clearly followed the high ridges of the Forest to Chelwood Gate and Wych Cross, and which then continued westwards to West Hoathly, Selsfield, Turners Hill and beyond.Margary (1965) p.264.

Shelling peaked in late November and December 1991, then diminished in 1992 after the Vance plan was accepted by the combatants. Airstrikes and attacks by JNA infantry and armored units against targets in the city accompanied the bombardment, which caused approximately 800 deaths and resulted in a large portion of the city's population leaving. Croatian sources estimated that 6,000 artillery shells were fired against Osijek over the period. After the JNA captured Vukovar on 18 November 1991, Osijek was the next target for its campaign in Croatia. The JNA units subordinated to the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, supported by the Serb Volunteer Guard, achieved modest advances in late November and early December, capturing several villages south of Osijek, but the Croatian Army maintained its defensive front and limited the JNA's advances. In the aftermath of the Battle of Osijek, Croatian authorities charged thirteen JNA officers with war crimes against civilians, but no arrests have been made to date. Croatian authorities also charged the wartime commander of Osijek's defence, Branimir Glavaš, and five others with war crimes committed in the city in 1991. The five were convicted and received sentences ranging between eight and ten years, and as of March 2015, judicial proceedings against Glavaš are in progress. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) to minimize potential resistance. On 17 August 1990, the escalating tensions turned into open revolt by the Croatian Serbs. The revolt took place in the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin and in parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. In January 1991, Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, made two unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval from the Yugoslav Presidency to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces. After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March 1991, and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević in the summer of 1991 as the Yugoslav federation started to fall apart. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the first fatalities of the war. The JNA then stepped in to support the insurgents and prevent Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia announced their intention to integrate the areas under their control with Serbia. The Government of Croatia considered this an act of secession. Timeline Map showing the fighting in eastern Slavonia, September 1991 – January 1992; Osijek is located in the bulge (salient) near the top of the map The JNA intervened directly against Croatia for the first time on 3 July 1991, driving Croatian forces out of Baranja, north of the city of Osijek, and out of Erdut, Aljmaš and Dalj east of Osijek. The advance was followed by intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci. At several points, JNA positions approached to within several hundred yards of Osijek city limits. The JNA units near Osijek were subordinated to the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, commanded by Major General Andrija Biorčević. In the city itself, the JNA had several barracks which housed the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade and the 12th Mixed Artillery Regiment. The 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade contained one of a handful battalions maintained by the JNA at full combat readiness. Osijek was established as their starting point in a planned westward offensive toward Našice and Bjelovar. Croatian forces in the area were formally subordinated to the Operational Zone Command in Osijek headed by Colonel Karl Gorinšek. In practice, the city's defense was overseen by Branimir Glavaš, then head of the National Defence Office in Osijek, according to information presented at Glavaš trial in the 2000s. Glavaš formally became commander of city defenses on 7 December 1991. =Bombardment of the city= Partially repaired bombardment damage in Osijek The JNA first attacked Osijek by mortar fire on 31 July 1991, and heavily bombarded the city's center on 19 August 1991. The attacks came from positions north, east and south of Osijek, and were supported by JNA garrisons stationed in Osijek itself. On 7–9 September, an inconclusive battle was fought in Tenja, within of the city. The JNA garrisons were besieged by Croatian forces in mid-September. After a barracks in the city centre was captured on 15 September 1991, the remaining JNA garrison tried to break through the Croatian troops besieging the barracks and, after heavy fighting, reached JNA positions south of Osijek on 17 September 1991. The intensity of the shelling increased thereafter, peaking through November and December. After a ceasefire was arranged in January 1992, following the acceptance of the Vance plan, the artillery attacks dropped off and became intermittent, and ceased by June. During its height, the intensity of the bombardment was reported to reach as high as one shell per minute, and the artillery attacks were compounded by Yugoslav Air Force strikes against the city. According to Croatian sources, a total of 6,000 artillery shells were fired against Osijek in the period. Prior to the start of the bombardment, the civilian population of Osijek totaled 104,761 city residents and 129,792 municipal residents. These numbers were significantly reduced as civilians fled the fighting. It is estimated that only about a third of the population remained in the city by the end of November, with some sources placing the estimate even lower, suggesting that the population of the city was reduced to just 10,000 civilians during the most intense periods of the bombardment. Those who remained in Osijek through the fighting generally slept in bomb shelters. =Ground offensive= After JNA captured Vukovar on 18 November, the JNA 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, supported by the Serbian Ministry of Interior- trained Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitaries, started to advance west between Vinkovci and Osijek on 20 November. The city of Osijek appeared to be the next target of the JNA, which was later confirmed by General Života Panić, commander of the JNA 1st Military District. On 21 November 1991, the JNA captured the villages of Stari Seleš, Novi Seleš and Ernestinovo situated approximately south of Osijek. Laslovo, south of Ernestinovo, was captured three days later. Those developments threatened Đakovo and pointed to the potential encirclement of Osijek. On 4 December 1991, the Special Envoy of Secretary-General of the United Nations Cyrus Vance visited Osijek to inspect the damage. In early December, the JNA made modest advances, capturing Antunovac located south of Osijek on 5 December 1991. On the same day, an armoured JNA force unsuccessfully attacked positions held by the Croatian 106th Brigade in Rosinjača Forest near Nemetin, approximately east of Osijek. On 6 December, the JNA pushed Croatian troops out from Tenja, followed by a heavy attack against Osijek repulsed by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska HV) on 7 December. On 11 December, HV personnel entered the frontline village of Paulin Dvor, less than west of Ernestinovo, and summarily executed 19 civilians (18 Serbs and one Hungarian). The JNA captured Paulin Dvor five days later, on 16 December, and attacked Osijek once again. The HV managed to contain the attack, though fighting continued south of Osijek until January 1992. =Operation Devil's Beam= Advances of the JNA north of Osijek threatened HV control of a narrow bridgehead held across the Drava River skirting the city's northern edge. By mid-December the bridgehead was reduced to a strip of land opposite Osijek, encompassing suburban settlements of Podravlje and Tvrđavica. In order to remove the threat, the HV launched an offensive codenamed Operation Devil's Beam () on 17–18 December. The offensive, involving the 1st Battalion of the 135th Brigade, elements of the special forces Frankopan Battalion and the Osijek-based Orao special police unit, Drava River flotilla, artillery of the 106th Brigade, and personnel of the 4th Beli Manastir Police Station, successfully pushed the JNA north, across Stara Drava oxbow lake located approximately north of Osijek. The JNA also withdrew from the village of Kopačevo towards Darda and Vardarac, but the HV did not have sufficient resources to exploit the development. The HV lost eight killed in the offensive, but the JNA's advance towards Osijek from the north was halted. Aftermath By June 1992, approximately 800 people had been killed by the bombardment. By the end of the Croatian War of Independence in 1995, a total of 1,724 people from Osijek had been killed, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians. The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of direct damage occurring as a consequence of the 1991–92 bombardment. Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3 billion. The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during the bombardment. Although media reported on the bombardment of Osijek, journalists in the city itself felt that it was receiving an unduly low level of media coverage compared to wartime events elsewhere in Croatia. The attacks on Osijek were welcomed by the Pravoslavlje newspaper published by the Serbian Orthodox Church, which appeared to give a blessing to the attack as a part of a \\"holy war\\", setting it in the context of World War II massacres and concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia. The JNA withdrew from Croatia in 1992, but continued to contribute personnel and equipment to the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (ARSK) which controlled the areas previously held by the JNA. Although the United Nations Protection Force peacekeepers deployed to the area on the basis of the Vance plan and placed most of the ARSK heavy weapons in storage, Osijek was intermittently bombarded throughout the war—the last artillery strike occurred in September 1995. The hostilities ceased in November 1995 through the Erdut Agreement securing restoration of Croatian rule in the region. In November 2010, then-Croatian President Ivo Josipović officially apologized for the Paulin Dvor massacre, shortly after his Serbian counterpart Boris Tadić issued a formal apology for the massacre at Vukovar. =War crime trials= In 2008, Croatian authorities formally charged Colonel Boro Ivanović, commanding officer of the JNA 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade, and twelve other JNA officers with war crimes against the civilian population. The charges include causing the deaths of 307 civilians in Osijek and surrounding areas, injuries to another 171 civilians, and the destruction of at least 1,188 different structures. , all of the indicted officers remain at large in Serbia. In 2005, the Osijek District Court convicted former Croatian soldier Nikola Ivanković for his involvement in the killings at Paulin Dvor, and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. In 2012, Enes Vitesković was also convicted for his involvement in the atrocity, and given an eleven-year sentence. After the war, five Croatian fighters were charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and one of torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, when he was arrested and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 2015, the conviction was set aside by the Constitutional Court of Croatia, pending a new trial before the Supreme Court of Croatia.

Piero Vettori (Latin: Petrus Victorius) (1499 – 8 December 1585) was an Italian writer, philologist and humanist. Life Vettori was born in Florence and in his life dealt with numerous matters, from agriculture to sciences, from rhetorics to moral philosophy, and also catalogued codexes in Florence and Italy. However his main interest was the study of ancient classics, especially Greek texts. In 1522 he traveled to Spain with his cousin Paolo Vettori, naval commander of the Papal States, and there he collected numerous ancient inscriptions which, once back to Florence, he tried to interpret. An adversary of the House of Medici, after the death of the Republic and the establishment of the Duchy of Florence in 1530, Vettori retired to San Casciano Val di Pesa, where he wrote the Trattato delle lodi et della coltivazione de gli ulivi (\\"Treatise on the praise and the cultivation of olive trees\\"). In 1538 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici called him to Florence, offering him a position as professor of Greek and Latin in the Studio Fiorentino, where he taught until 1583. He died in Florence in 1585. Works His other works include the Castigationes (commentaries) of Cicero's family letter, and editions of works by Varro, Cato, Aeschylus, Sallust, Aristotle, Euripides's Electra and others. His edition of Aeschylus (1557) was the first printed edition to include the whole of the Agamemnon, as the earlier editors of Aeschylus Francesco Robortello and Adrianus Turnebus had only had lines 1-310 and 1067-1159 available to them. Vettori made very few textual conjectures in this edition, but Henricus Stephanus, who printed it, added an appendix with some further corrections.E. Fraenkel, Aeschylus: Agamemnon, volume 1, pp. 34-35. He also edited the works of his friend Giovanni della Casa after the latter's death. In 1553 he published the first 25 books of the Variarum lectionum, followed by another thirteen in 1569 and republished integrally in 1582.

Particular applications of the Coppersmith method for attacking RSA include cases when the public exponent e is small or when partial knowledge of the secret key is available. RSA basics The public key in the RSA system is a tuple of integers (N,e), where N is the product of two primes p and q. The secret key is given by an integer d satisfying ed\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{(p-1)(q-1)}; equivalently, the secret key may be given by d_p\\\\equiv d \\\\pmod{p-1} and d_q\\\\equiv d \\\\pmod{q-1} if the Chinese remainder theorem is used to improve the speed of decryption, see CRT- RSA. Encryption of a message M produces the ciphertext C\\\\equiv M^e\\\\pmod{N} which can be decrypted using d by computing C^d\\\\equiv M \\\\pmod{N}. Low public exponent attack In order to reduce encryption or signature-verification time, it is useful to use a small public exponent (e). In practice, common choices for e are 3, 17 and 65537 (2^{16}+1). These values for e are Fermat primes, sometimes referred to as F_0, F_2 and F_4 respectively (F_x=2^{2^x}+1). They are chosen because they make the modular exponentiation operation faster. Also, having chosen such e, it is simpler to test whether \\\\gcd(e, p-1)=1 and \\\\gcd(e, q-1)=1 while generating and testing the primes in step 1 of the key generation. Values of p or q that fail this test can be rejected there and then. (Even better: if e is prime and greater than 2 then the test p\\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\, e e1 can replace the more expensive test \\\\gcd(p-1,e)= 1.) If the public exponent is small and the plaintext m is very short, then the RSA function may be easy to invert which makes certain attacks possible. Padding schemes ensure that messages have full lengths but additionally choosing public exponent e = 2^{16} + 1 is recommended. When this value is used, signature-verification requires 17 multiplications, as opposed to about 25 when a random e of similar size is used. Unlike low private exponent (see Wiener's Attack), attacks that apply when a small e is used are far from a total break which would recover the secret key d. The most powerful attacks on low public exponent RSA are based on the following theorem which is due to Don Coppersmith.  Coppersmith method  ; Theorem 1 (Coppersmith)D. Boneh, Twenty years of attacks on the RSA cryptosystem :Let N be an integer and f \\\\in {\\\\mathbb Z}[x] be a monic polynomial of degree d over the integers. Set X=N^{ \\\\frac{1}{d} - \\\\epsilon} for \\\\frac{1}{d} > \\\\epsilon > 0. Then, given \\\\left \\\\langle N,f \\\\right \\\\rangle attacker, Eve, can efficiently find all integers x_0 < X satisfying f(x_0) \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{N}. The running time is dominated by the time it takes to run the LLL algorithm on a lattice of dimension O(w) with w = {\\\\rm min} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}, \\\\log_2N\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. This theorem states the existence of an algorithm which can efficiently find all roots of f modulo N that are smaller than X = N^{ \\\\frac{1}{d}} . As X gets smaller, the algorithm's runtime will decrease. This theorem's strength is the ability to find all small roots of polynomials modulo a composite N. Håstad's broadcast attack The simplest form of Håstad's attackGlenn Durfee, Cryptanalysis of RSA Using Algebraic and Lattice Methods is presented to ease understanding. The general case uses the Coppersmith method. Suppose one sender sends the same message M in encrypted form to a number of people P_1;P_2;\\\\dots ;P_k , each using the same small public exponent e, say e=3, and different moduli \\\\left \\\\langle N_i,e \\\\right \\\\rangle . A simple argument shows that as soon as k \\\\ge 3 ciphertexts are known, the message M is no longer secure: Suppose Eve intercepts C_1 , C_2, and C_3, where C_i \\\\equiv M^3\\\\pmod{N_i}. We may assume \\\\gcd(N_i , N_j ) = 1 for all i, j (otherwise, it is possible to compute a factor of one of the N_i’s by computing \\\\gcd(N_i,N_j).) By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, she may compute C \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^*_{N_1N_2N_3} such that C \\\\equiv C_i \\\\pmod{N_i}. Then C \\\\equiv M^3\\\\pmod{N_1 N_2 N_3} ; however, since M < N_i for all i', we have M^3 < N_1N_2N_3. Thus C = M^3 holds over the integers, and Eve can compute the cube root of C to obtain M. For larger values of e more ciphertexts are needed, particularly, e ciphertexts are sufficient. =Generalizations= Håstad also showed that applying a linear- padding to M prior to encryption does not protect against this attack. Assume the attacker learns that C_i = f_i(M)^{e} for 1\\\\leq i \\\\leq k and some linear function f_i, i.e., Bob applies a pad to the message M prior to encrypting it so that the recipients receive slightly different messages. For instance, if M is m bits long, Bob might encrypt M_i=i2^m+M and send this to the i-th recipient. If a large enough group of people is involved, the attacker can recover the plaintext M_i from all the ciphertext with similar methods. In more generality, Håstad proved that a system of univariate equations modulo relatively prime composites, such as applying any fixed polynomial g_i(M) \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{N_i}, could be solved if sufficiently many equations are provided. This attack suggests that randomized padding should be used in RSA encryption. ; Theorem 2 (Håstad) :Suppose N_1,\\\\dots ,N_k are relatively prime integers and set N_{\\\\rm min} = {\\\\rm min}_i\\\\\\\\{N_i\\\\\\\\}. Let g_i (x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}/N_i\\\\left [ x \\\\right ] be k polynomials of maximum degree q. Suppose there exists a unique M < N_{\\\\rm min} satisfying g_i(M) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{N_i} for all i \\\\in \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1,\\\\dots , k \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Furthermore, suppose k > q. There is an efficient algorithm which, given \\\\left \\\\langle N_i, g_i \\\\left ( x \\\\right ) \\\\right \\\\rangle for all i, computes M. ; Proof Since the N_i are relatively prime the Chinese Remainder Theorem might be used to compute coefficients T_i satisfying T_i\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{N_i} and T_i \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{N_j} for all i e j . Setting g(x) = \\\\sum T_i \\\\cdot g_i (x) we know that g(M)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{\\\\prod N_i}. Since the T_i are nonzero we have that g\\\\left(x\\\\right) is also nonzero. The degree of g\\\\left(x\\\\right) is at most q. By Coppersmith’s Theorem, we may compute all integer roots x_0 satisfying g (x_0)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{\\\\prod N_i} and \\\\left  x_0 \\\\right < \\\\left(\\\\prod N_i \\\\right )^{\\\\frac{1}{q}}. However, we know that M < N_{\\\\rm min} < (\\\\prod N_i)^{\\\\frac{1}{k}} < (\\\\prod N_i)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}} , so M is among the roots found by Coppersmith's theorem. This theorem can be applied to the problem of broadcast RSA in the following manner: Suppose the i-th plaintext is padded with a polynomial f_i \\\\left(x \\\\right), so that g_i = \\\\left ( f_i\\\\left ( x \\\\right ) \\\\right )^{e_i}-C_i \\\\bmod\\\\ N_i. Then g_i(M) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod N_i is true, and Coppersmith’s method can be used. The attack succeeds once k > {\\\\rm max}_i (e_i \\\\cdot \\\\deg f_i) , where k is the number of messages. The original result used Håstad’s variant instead of the full Coppersmith method. As a result, it required k = O (q^{2}) messages, where q = {\\\\rm max}_i(e_i . \\\\deg f_i). Franklin-Reiter related-message attack Franklin-Reiter identified a new attack against RSA with public exponent e=3. If two messages differ only by a known fixed difference between the two messages and are RSA encrypted under the same RSA modulus N, then it is possible to recover both of them. Let \\\\left \\\\langle N; e_i \\\\right \\\\rangle be Alice's public key. Suppose M_1;M_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_N are two distinct messages satisfying M_1 \\\\equiv f(M_2)\\\\pmod{N} for some publicly known polynomial f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_N[x]. To send M_1 and M_2 to Alice, Bob may naively encrypt the messages and transmit the resulting ciphertexts C_1; C_2. Eve can easily recover M_1;M_2 given C_1; C_2, by using the following theorem: ; Theorem 3 (Franklin-Reiter) :Set e = 3 and let \\\\left \\\\langle N,e \\\\right \\\\rangle be an RSA public key. Let M_1 e M_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^*_N satisfy M_1 \\\\equiv f(M_2)\\\\pmod{N} for some linear polynomial f = ax+b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_N[x] with b e 0 . Then, given \\\\left \\\\langle N,e,C_1,C_2,f \\\\right \\\\rangle, attacker, Eve, can recover M_1,M_2 in time quadratic in \\\\log_2 N. For an arbitrary e (rather than restricting to e=3) the time required is quadratic in e and \\\\log_2 N. ; Proof Since C_1\\\\equiv M_1^e\\\\pmod{N}, we know that M_2 is a root of the polynomial g_1(x)=f(x)^e - C_1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_N[x]. Similarly, M_2 is a root of g_2(x)=x^e-C_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_N[x]. The linear factor x-M_2 divides both polynomials. Therefore, Eve calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of g_1 and g_2, if the gcd turns out to be linear, M_2 is found. The gcd can be computed in quadratic time in e and \\\\log_2 N using the Euclidean algorithm. Coppersmith’s short- pad attack Like Håstad’s and Franklin-Reiter’s attack, this attack exploits a weakness of RSA with public exponent e=3. Coppersmith showed that if randomized padding suggested by Håstad is used improperly then RSA encryption is not secure. Suppose Bob sends a message M to Alice using a small random padding before encrypting it. An attacker, Eve, intercepts the ciphertext and prevents it from reaching its destination. Bob decides to resend M to Alice because Alice did not respond to his message. He randomly pads M again and transmits the resulting ciphertext. Eve now has two ciphertexts corresponding to two encryptions of the same message using two different random pads. Even though Eve does not know the random pad being used, she still can recover the message M by using the following theorem, if the random padding is too short. ; Theorem 4 (Coppersmith) :Let \\\\left \\\\langle N,e\\\\right \\\\rangle be a public RSA key where N is n-bits long. Set m = \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n}{e^2} \\\\rfloor. Let M \\\\in \\\\mathbb {Z}^*_N be a message of length at most n-m bits. Define M_1 = 2^m M + r_1 and M_2 = 2^m M + r_2, where r_1 and r_2 are distinct integers with 0 \\\\le r_1, r_2 < 2^m. If Eve is given \\\\left \\\\langle N, e\\\\right \\\\rangle and the encryptions C_1, C_2 of M_1, M_2 (but is not given r_1 or r_2), she can efficiently recover M. ; Proof Define g_1(x,y) = x^e - C_1 and g_2(x,y) = (x + y)^e - C_2. We know that when y=r_2 - r_1, these polynomials have x=M_1 as a common root. In other words, \\\\vartriangle =r_2 - r_1 is a root of the resultant h(y) = {\\\\rm res}_x(g_1,g_2) \\\\in \\\\mathbb {Z}_N[y]. Furthermore, \\\\left  \\\\vartriangle \\\\right  < 2^m < N^{ \\\\frac {1}{e^2}}. Hence, \\\\vartriangle is a small root of h modulo N, and Eve can efficiently find it using the Coppersmith method. Once \\\\vartriangle is known, the Franklin-Reiter attack can be used to recover M_2 and consequently M.

He has made several hit albums and toured as trio Fredericks Goldman Jones (formed by Michael Jones, French singer-songwriter Jean-Jacques Goldman and American singer Carole Fredericks) and collaborated on a number of songs with Goldman. Biography Jones was born in Welshpool of a Welsh father, John Merick Jones (who landed in Normandy during World War II) and a French mother from Normandy, Simone Lalleman. As a young man, he studied drums and guitar. In 1966, he started his first group: Urban District Council Dib Bob Band. At 19, he went to France on vacation and never left. He played guitar and sang with a Norman group called Travert & Cie from 1971 to 1979 and with the group BUDDY C from 1979 to 1983. Later, he joined the group Taï Phong, where he met Jean-Jacques Goldman, whom he replaced on tour. In 1979, he performed with the group from Toulouse Week- end Millionnaire. When Taï Phong disbanded in 1980, Michael formed another group called Gulfstream. In 1983, he rejoined Jean-Jacques Goldman and Carole Fredericks. In 1985, he co-wrote the hit \\"Je te donne\\" with Goldman. In 1986, he wrote the single \\"Guitar Man,\\" which he sang on tour with Goldman. In 1990, the Fredericks Goldman Jones trio was formed, which lasted five years. Their eponymous album was Fredericks Goldman Jones. Their most famous hit from this period was \\"À nos actes manqués\\". In 1998, he participated in Goldman's album En passant and in the tour that followed. In 2001, he participated in Goldman's album Chanson pour les pieds and in the tour that followed. In addition to his work with Goldman, he continued a solo career, releasing A consommer sans modération in 1997, and Prises et reprises in 2004. He formed a group called El Club with Erick Benzi, Gildas Arzel, and Christian Séguret, which released an album in 2007. In November 2008, Jones was invited by the English group Status Quo to join them as support act on their French tour. The album, Celtic Blues, appeared in 2009 and was followed by a tour in France and a live album Celtic Blues Live. In 2013, Jones presented his album 40 60 and stated that he is going to end his career as a musician due to health reasons. The title of this album is a reference to the 40 years span of his career and his age. Two new songs composed by Jean-Jacques Goldman are on this album and a new recording of the Jones-Goldman duet \\"Je te donne\\" in an acoustic version. It contains also a duet with Francis Cabrel.

Wiener, is a type of cryptographic attack against RSA. The attack uses the continued fraction method to expose the private key d when d is small.  Background on RSA  Fictional characters Alice and Bob are people who want to communicate securely. More specifically, Alice wants to send a message to Bob which only Bob can read. First Bob chooses two primes p and q. Then he calculates the RSA modulus N = pq. This RSA modulus is made public together with the encryption exponent e. N and e form the public key pair (e,N). By making this information public, anyone can encrypt messages to Bob. The decryption exponent d satisfies ed=1 \\\\bmod \\\\lambda (N), where \\\\lambda (N) denotes the Carmichael function, though sometimes \\\\varphi(N), the Euler’s phi function, is used (note: this is the order of the multiplicative group \\\\mathbb{Z}_N^*, which is not necessarily a cyclic group). The encryption exponent e and \\\\lambda (N) also must be relatively prime so that there is a modular inverse. The factorization of N and the private key d are kept secret, so that only Bob can decrypt the message. We denote the private key pair as (d, N). The encryption of the message M is given by C\\\\equiv M^e\\\\bmod N and the decryption of cipher text C is given by C^d\\\\equiv (M^e)^d\\\\equiv M^{(ed)}\\\\equiv M \\\\bmod N (using Fermat's little theorem). Using the Euclidean algorithm, one can efficiently recover the secret key d if one knows the factorization of N. By having the secret key d, one can efficiently factor the modulus of N.L. Render, Elaine (2007). Wiener's Attack on Short Secret Exponents.  Small private key  In the RSA cryptosystem, Bob might tend to use a small value of d, rather than a large random number to improve the RSA decryption performance. However, Wiener’s attack shows that choosing a small value for d will result in an insecure system in which an attacker can recover all secret information, i.e., break the RSA system. This break is based on Wiener’s Theorem, which holds for small values of d. Wiener has proved that the attacker may efficiently find d when d< \\\\frac{1}{3}N^{\\\\frac{1}{4}} . Wiener's paper also presented some countermeasures against his attack that allow fast decryption. Two techniques are described as follows. Choosing large public key: Replace e by e', where e'=e+k \\\\cdot \\\\lambda (N) for some large of k . When e' is large enough, i.e. e'>N^{ \\\\frac{3}{2}} , then Wiener’s attack can not be applied regardless of how small d is. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Suppose one chooses d such that both d_p = d \\\\bmod (p-1) and d_{q} = d \\\\bmod (q-1) are small but d itself is not, then a fast decryption of C can be done as follows: 1\\\\. First compute M_p\\\\equiv C^{d_p} \\\\bmod p and M_q\\\\equiv C^{d_q} \\\\bmod q . 2\\\\. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to compute the unique value of M \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z_N} which satisfies M\\\\equiv M_p \\\\bmod p and M\\\\equiv M_q \\\\bmod q . The result of M satisfies M\\\\equiv C^{d} \\\\bmod N as needed. The point is that Wiener’s attack does not apply here because the value of d \\\\bmod \\\\lambda (N) can be large. Cui, Xiao-lei (2005). Attacks On the RSA Cryptosystem.  How Wiener's attack works  Note that : \\\\lambda(N) = \\\\operatorname{lcm}(p-1, q-1) = \\\\frac{(p-1)(q-1)}{G} = \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(N)}{G} where G = \\\\gcd (p-1, q-1) Since : ed\\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{\\\\lambda(N)} , there exists an integer K such that : ed = K \\\\times \\\\lambda(N)+1 : ed = \\\\frac {K}{G} (p-1)(q-1)+1 Defining k = \\\\frac {K}{\\\\gcd(K,G)} and g= \\\\frac {G}{\\\\gcd(K,G)} , and substituting into the above gives: :ed = \\\\frac {k}{g} (p-1) (q-1)+1. Divided by dpq: :\\\\frac{e}{pq} = \\\\frac{k}{dg} (1- \\\\delta), where \\\\delta = \\\\frac {p+q-1- \\\\frac {g}{k}}{pq} . So, \\\\frac {e}{pq} is slightly smaller than \\\\frac {k}{dg}, and the former is composed entirely of public information. However, a method of checking and guess is still required. Assuming that ed > pq (a reasonable assumption unless G is large) the last equation above may be written as: : edg=k(p-1)(q-1) + g By using simple algebraic manipulations and identities, a guess can be checked for accuracy.  Wiener's theorem  Let \\\\ N = pq with \\\\ q < p < 2q . Let d < \\\\frac{1}{3} N^{\\\\frac{1}{4}}. Given \\\\left \\\\langle N,e\\\\right \\\\rangle with ed \\\\equiv 1\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{mod}\\\\ \\\\lambda (N)), the attacker can efficiently recover d.Boneh, Dan (1999). Twenty Years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem. Notices of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) 46 (2).  Example  Suppose that the public keys are \\\\left \\\\langle N,e\\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\langle 90581,17993\\\\right \\\\rangle The attack shall determine d . By using Wiener's Theorem and continued fractions to approximate d, first we try to find the continued fractions expansion of \\\\frac{e}{N} . Note that this algorithm finds fractions in their lowest terms. We know that :\\\\frac{e}{N} = \\\\frac{17993}{90581} = \\\\cfrac{1}{5 + \\\\cfrac{1}{29 +\\\\dots + \\\\cfrac{1}{3}}} = \\\\left [0,5,29,4,1,3,2,4,3 \\\\right ] According to the continued fractions expansion of \\\\frac{e}{N} , all convergents \\\\frac{k}{d} are: : \\\\frac{k}{d} = 0, \\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\frac{29}{146}, \\\\frac{117}{589}, \\\\frac{146}{735}, \\\\frac{555}{2794}, \\\\frac{1256}{6323}, \\\\frac{5579}{28086}, \\\\frac{17993}{90581} We can verify that the first convergent does not produce a factorization of N. However, the convergent \\\\frac{1}{5} yields : \\\\varphi (N) = \\\\frac{ed - 1}{k} = \\\\frac{17993\\\\times5 - 1}{1} = 89964 Now, if we solve the equation :x^2 - \\\\left ( \\\\left (N - \\\\varphi (N) \\\\right ) + 1 \\\\right )x + N = 0 :x^2 - \\\\left ( \\\\left (90581 - 89964 \\\\right ) + 1 \\\\right )x + 90581 = 0 :x^2 - 618x + 90581 = 0 then we find the roots which are x = 379 ; 239. Therefore we have found the factorization :N = 90581 = 379 \\\\times 239 = p \\\\times q. Notice that, for the modulus N = 90581, Wiener's Theorem will work if :d < \\\\frac{N^{ \\\\frac{1}{4}}}{3} \\\\approx 5.7828. = Proof of Wiener's theorem= The proof is based on approximations using continued fractions.Khaled Salah, Imad (2006). Mathematical Attacks on RSA Cryptosystem. Journal of Computer Science 2 (8)). pp. 665-671. Since ed = 1\\\\bmod \\\\lambda (N), there exists a \\\\mathit {k} such that ed - k \\\\lambda (N) = 1. Therefore :\\\\left  \\\\frac {e}{\\\\lambda (N)}- \\\\frac {k}{d} \\\\right \\\\vert = \\\\frac{1}{d \\\\lambda (N)}. Let G = \\\\gcd (p-1, q-1), note that if \\\\varphi(N) is used instead of \\\\lambda(N) , then the proof can be replaced with G = 1 and \\\\varphi(N) replaced with \\\\lambda(N) . Then multiplying by \\\\frac{1}{G}, :\\\\left  \\\\frac {e}{\\\\varphi (N)}- \\\\frac {k}{Gd} \\\\right \\\\vert = \\\\frac{1}{d \\\\varphi (N)} Hence, \\\\frac {k}{Gd} is an approximation of \\\\frac{e}{\\\\varphi(N)}. Although the attacker does not know \\\\varphi(N), he may use N to approximate it. Indeed, since \\\\varphi(N)= N-p-q+1 and p+q-1<3 \\\\sqrt{N} , we have: :\\\\left \\\\vert p+q-1 \\\\right \\\\vert < 3 \\\\sqrt{N} :\\\\left \\\\vert N-\\\\varphi (N) \\\\right \\\\vert < 3 \\\\sqrt{N} Using N in place of \\\\varphi(N) we obtain: :\\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{e}{N}- \\\\frac{k}{Gd} \\\\right \\\\vert = \\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{edG-kN}{NGd} \\\\right \\\\vert ::::\\\\qquad = \\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{edG-k \\\\varphi (N)-kN+k \\\\varphi (N)}{NGd} \\\\right \\\\vert ::::= \\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{1-k(N- \\\\varphi (N))}{NGd} \\\\right \\\\vert ::::\\\\le \\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{3k \\\\sqrt{N}}{NGd} \\\\right \\\\vert = \\\\frac {3k \\\\sqrt{N}}{\\\\sqrt{N} \\\\sqrt{N}Gd} \\\\le \\\\frac {3k}{d \\\\sqrt{N}} Now, k \\\\lambda (N)=ed-1, so k \\\\lambda (N). Since e< \\\\lambda (N) , so k \\\\lambda (N), then we obtain: :k \\\\lambda (N)<\\\\lambda (N)d :::k Since k and d< \\\\frac{1}{3} N^{\\\\frac{1}{4}} . Hence we obtain: : (1) \\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{e}{N}- \\\\frac{k}{Gd} \\\\right \\\\vert \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{dN^{\\\\frac{1}{4}}} Since d< \\\\frac{1}{3}N^{ \\\\frac{1}{4}},2d<3d, then 2d<3d, we obtain: :2d, so (2) \\\\frac{1}{2d}> \\\\frac{1}{N^{\\\\frac{1}{4}}} From (1) and (2), we can conclude that :\\\\left \\\\vert \\\\frac{e}{N}- \\\\frac{k}{Gd} \\\\right \\\\vert \\\\le \\\\frac{3k}{d \\\\sqrt{N}}< \\\\frac{1}{d \\\\cdot 2d}= \\\\frac{1}{2d^2} If \\\\left \\\\vert x - \\\\frac{a}{b} \\\\right \\\\vert < \\\\frac{1}{2b^2} , then \\\\frac{a}{b} is a convergent of x, thus \\\\frac{k}{d} appears among the convergents of \\\\frac{e}{N}. Therefore the algorithm will indeed eventually find \\\\frac{k}{Gd}.  References   Further reading  * Coppersmith, Don (1996). Low-Exponent RSA with Related Messages.

It was designed to advertise their SD Memory card. Overview The Idea was to take hundreds of paper aeroplanes all with SD cards attached and dangle them underneath a helium weather balloon this balloon would then travel all the way to the edge of space before releasing the paper planes to fall back down to earth. Each memory card would contain a personal message to the person who found it. The people who find these SD cards will then hopefully message back the Project Space Planes team so they could see how fair there paper planes had travelled. The point of this exercise is to prove how tough these SD cards are. Launch The launch was delayed multiple times due to weather issues but finally took place from a barn in Wolfsburg in Germany. 200 paper plans were launched from a balloon filled with 7,815 litres of helium gas, reached 37,339 metres (122,503 feet) before it burst and fell back down to earth. It took about 2.6 hours to rise up to this height and then only 40 minutes to fall back down and land. The payload travelled over 300 kilometres from the launch site near Wolfsburg and landed just north of Schonwald, narrowly dodging a lake, a river and a military base.

Over the centuries, Luxembourg's churches and castles have housed a number of cultural artefacts but these are nearly all ascribed to foreign artists. The first examples of art with a national flavour are paintings and maps of the City of Luxembourg and its fortifications from the end of the 16th until the beginning of the 19th century, although these too were mostly created by foreign artists. Real interest in art among the country's own citizens began in the 19th century with paintings of Luxembourg and the surroundings after the country became a grand duchy in 1815. This was followed by interest in Impressionism and Expressionism in the early 20th century, the richest period in Luxembourg painting, while Abstraction became the focus of art after the Second World War. Today there are a number of successful contemporary artists, some of whom have gained wide international recognition. Antiquity A considerable number of sculptures and statues have been found in the ruins of Roman villas in various parts of Luxembourg, but the outstanding artistic treasure of the period is the Vichten mosaic which depicts the ancient Greek muses. It used to adorn the reception hall of a Roman villa in Vichten but can now be seen in Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art.\\"Mosaïque aux Muses\\", Musée National d'Histoire et d'Art. Retrieved 25 January 2011.

One of the most lavishly illustrated Ottonian manuscripts, it was produced at the Abbey of Echternach under the direction of Abbot Humbert. The refined Echternach style of painting is characterized by rich colouring, clear shapes and careful accentuation of the figures, interpreting the art of the Master of Trier with considerable originality. The Echternach illuminators drew on the style and iconography of much older works found in the libraries of Trier and Reichenau. The Codex Aureus is one of just two manuscripts which was kept at Echternach over the centuries, most of the others being produced for the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. It is now in the German National Museum in Nuremberg.\\"Petite histoire du Codex Aureus Epternacensis\\", Pastorale biblique diocésaine de Luxembourg.

One of the oldest works relating to the City of Luxembourg is a tinted pen-and-ink drawing of the Château Mansfeld or, more correctly, the Château de la Fontaine. The 16th- century work is attributed to the Flemish artist Tobias Verhaecht (1561–1631). Mansfeld was governor of Luxembourg from 1545 until his death in 1604. In 1598, Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg published the oldest known view of Luxembourg City, a copper engraving that appeared in Civitates orbis terrarum (Cologne, 1598). Half a century later, the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu, drawing on Braun's work, published his \\"Luxemburgum\\" in the second volume of his Stedeboek (Amsterdam, 1649). Van der Meulen provides another view of Luxembourg from Limpertsberg where he depicts French troops taking the city in 1649.Jacques Mersch, \\"Luxembourg: vues ancienne\\", Editions Paul Bruck, Luxembourg, 1977.

Jean-Baptiste Fresez (1800–1867) was the most important artist of the period, remembered above all for his almost photographic images of the City of Luxembourg.\\"Frenez, Jean-Baptiste\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. Fresez also produced portraits clearly depicting not just lively facial features but also the figure's clothing including, for example, the transparency of the lace. His landscapes, which he began to publish as early as 1826, were also of considerable artistic merit. In 1855, he published his famous Album pittoresque du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg containing extremely detailed compositions, many of them depicting Luxembourg's most beautiful views. His works are of great documentary value, especially those of the fortress of Luxembourg before it was dismantled.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Jean-Baptiste Fresez\\", Ons stad No 61, 1999. Retrieved 26 January 2011. Nicolas Liez (1809–1892), who had been one of Fresez' students, was a painter, sculptor and architect. He is remembered above all for his lithographs of scenes throughout the Grand Duchy and for his oil painting of the City of Luxembourg.\\"Liez, Nicolas\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. His collection of lithographs published in \\"Voyage pittoresque à travers le Grand Duché de Luxembourg\\" (1934) contains some of his very best work. His most famous work is his view of the City of Luxembourg from the Fetschenhof, which he drew, painted and lithographed in 1870. It shows the city when the demolition of the fortress had just begun. Despite his attempt to emphasise the fortifications by exaggerating the height of the cliffs and the railway bridge, the painting is a good representation of the city and its skyscape.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Nicolas Liez\\", Ons stad, No 62, 1999. Retrieved 26 January 2011 Michel Engels (1851–1901) was an illustrator, painter and art teacher who is principally remembered for his sketches of the fortifications of Luxembourg City although he also painted a few watercolours.\\"Engels, Michel\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006.

The first was the English Pre-impressionist painter J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851) who visited Luxembourg during extended study trips in 1825 and 1834 leaving many watercolours of the city and the surroundings.\\"Turner, Joseph Mallord William\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. Victor Hugo (1802–1885), the French author, visited Luxembourg on several occasions. In 1871, he made a number of drawings of Luxembourg's castles, including Larochette, Schengen and especially Vianden.\\"Hugo, Victor\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006.

Joseph Kutter (1894–1941), considered Luxembourg's most successful painter, was influenced by the Impressionists but developed his own distinctive Expressionist style. In his paintings, the subjects often stand in the foreground as if photographed. His portraits, painted with strong brushstrokes, typically show figures with excessively large noses, sometimes looking like despairing clowns, but always attracting attention.\\"The Champion: (Joseph Kutter - 1894-1941)\\" , P&T; Luxembourg. Retrieved 26 January 2011. From 1918, Kutter's landscapes and floral works began to present increasingly Expressionist motifs, with intense lines and strong colours. His painting of \\"Luxembourg\\", commissioned for the 1937 World Exposition in Paris is a good example of his Expressionist style with the houses stacked behind one another, the cubic form of the buildings and the exaggerated strength of the fortifications, so different from J. M. W. Turner's representation of almost the same scene.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Joseph Kutter\\" , Ons stad, No 73, 2003, p. 36\\\\. Retrieved 29 January 2011. Although Kutter spent a number of years in Germany, his work was most influenced by trends in France and Belgium. He was one of the founders of the Luxembourg secessionist movement.\\"Kutter and European Expressionism\\", Artline.ro. Retrieved 26 January 2011. Another notable painter was the Impressionist Dominique Lang (1874–1919) whose paintings became increasingly uplifting, full of bright light and often depicting a young woman clothed in white. Using short brushstrokes, he would make abundant use of blues and greens. In 1912–13, he began to adopt the pure colouring favoured by Monet, Renoir and Pissarro. He would venture out along the banks of the River Alzette, painting scenes of orchards, flower picking and fruit harvesting or of peasants' houses in the area where he lived. His painting of Dudelange en 1917 is an excellent illustration of his characteristic aversion to industrialization. There is no sign of factories or workmen's housing in the idyllic countryside surrounding the town.\\"Dominique Lang (1874-1919)\\" , Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines.

Klopp lived in Remich, where he painted many pictures of the bridge over the river. Both his landscapes and his still lifes are distinctive in their bright colouring and their solid strokes focusing firmly on the main subjects.\\"Nico Klopp (1894-1930)\\" , Musée National d'Histoire et d'Art.

Frantz Seimetz (1858–1934) was a prolific artist who painted portraits and landscapes in the Impressionist style.\\"Seimetz, Frantz\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. His most fruitful period was in Echternach, where he painted numerous scenes of the surroundings including the Mullerthal. His pictures are generally realistic and slightly romantic, bordering on Impressionism. Especially after 1900, his style became brighter and more colourful, reflecting the happiness and beauty of the moments he experienced. Today Seimetz is remembered as a conscientious artist who dominated the Luxembourg art scene for a considerable time. He was the first Luxembourger to delve into Impressionism and the first, after Nicolas Liez, to paint in the open air. He was also the first who managed to live from art alone.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Frantz Seimetz\\" , Ons stad No 64, 2000. Retrieved 26 January 2011. Sosthène Weis (1872-1941) painted over 5,000 watercolours, mostly of Luxembourg and its surroundings. He also worked as an architect, designing some of Luxembourg's most imposing buildings including the central post office and the Arbed building. His earlier paintings, up to 1900, show the influence of his architectural interests, as buildings are depicted with accurate but rather boring precision. Thereafter, his own romantic post-Impressionist style begins to emerge, especially in his work from 1915 to 1945. His warm colours predominate with an abundance of violets, blues and ochres. Weis mastered the art of capturing the moment, poetically reproducing the misty light of the early morning, the heat of noon or the haze gathering in the valleys at sunset. Little by little reality gave way to less precise, more suggestive images as he concentrated ever more on the essentials. He would rapidly fill out the main lines of his scenes, interpreting them more and more freely until finally his pictures revealed a world of dreams and fantasy.\\"Sosthène Weis (1872-1941)\\", Musée National d'Histoire et d'Art.

Although Kirscht turned to abstract painting in the 1950s with works such as Composition and Automnal, it was not until the early 1960s when he substituted acrylics for oils that he truly mastered the style.

While his postage stamps, posters and the logo for the emergency services have become part of Luxembourg's collective memory, his close attachment to his native Rumelange and the area's Red Rocks can be seen in his landscapes and engravings. The most typical part of his work is however the surrealist series of paintings he referred to as his Maennerscher or little men, many of them self-portraits constituting a one-man comedy. The symbols he uses guide the spectator to the extensive workings of his imagination.

It is located 6 miles north of Harrisonburg, Virginia. It contains the Linville United Church of Christ. History Linville Creek was one of the most important centers of Colonial Virginia during the eighteenth century. Its name is derived from William Linvell (various spellings: Linvel, Linwell), who was granted 15,000 acres in the area prior to 1739. Located along the Great Wagon Road in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Linville quickly became a civilized outpost on the frontier. Its earliest settlers were English Quakers, and few Scotch-Irish who were later joined by Swiss Germans many of whom moved south from Pennsylvania.http://www.imanfamily.net/rock/timeline/timeline.html Homestead in Linville in which Thomas Lincoln, father of President Abraham Lincoln, was born in 1778.Around 1750 Daniel Boone’s father Squire Boone moved his family from Oley, Pennsylvania to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The Boone family farmed in the Linville Creek area for several years in the 1750s before moving on to North Carolina. On August 14, 1756, Daniel Boone married Rebecca Ann Bryan, daughter of Morgan Bryan of Linville Creek, whom he met while living in the Linville area.http://mrlreference.blogspot.com/2012/07/daniel-boone-his- valley-connections.html Boone’s wife and children stayed in the Linville area while he explored the wilderness west of the Allegheny Mountains.https://www.rockinghamcountyva.gov/120/History-of-County President Abraham Lincoln's great-grandparents, \\"Virginia John\\" and Rebecca Flowers Lincoln also moved from Pennsylvania to Virginia in 1768 and settled on a 600-acre tract of land along Linville Creek. The President's father, Thomas Lincoln, was born on this property in 1778 before his family moved west to what is now Kentucky, which was then part of Virginia but across the mountains from the settled areas. The two story brick home on the property known as the Lincoln Homestead and Cemetery was built circa 1800 by the President's great- uncle Jacob Lincoln. The property, a registered Virginia Historic Landmark, includes a family cemetery where five generations of Lincolns are buried along with two slaves, identified as Queenie and Uncle Ned.https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/19/lincoln-homestead-offers- look-into-past/ During the antebellum period, Linville was an important stop on the underground railroad due to the large number of Anabaptists in the area who were opposed to slavery and helped runaway slaves find safe passage out of Rockingham through Brock's Gap to Pendleton for a walk through Franklin and on to Petersburg in what is now West Virginia where they could find rail passage to the north. Linville was affected by the major local floods of 1870. Its population at the time was 3547, with 17 \\"productive industries\\" in the town.

Early years José Manuel Jiménez was born in Trinidad, Cuba, Las Villas province into a musical family. He was the son of Maria Andrea Berroa and violinist Jose Julian Jiménez and was baptized in 1852 at the Parochial Church of the Santísima Trinidad. His grandfather was Francisco Nicasio Jiménez, orchestra and band leader. Jiménez studied music as a child with his father and his aunt, Cuban musician and composer Catalina Berroa, and at the age of 15 was hired as an accompanist for a concert at Palacio Brunet by visiting German violinist Karl Werner. At the recommendation of Werner, Jiménez traveled to Europe in 1867, where he studied piano with the Carl Armbrust in Hamburg, Carl Reinecke and Ignaz Moscheles at the Leipzig Conservatory and in Paris with Antoine Marmontel. Career After completing his studies, Jiménez toured as a concert pianist. With his father and brother Nicasio Jiménez, he formed one of the first all black ensembles, billed as \\"Das Negertrio\\", and successfully toured in Europe, the Americas and in Cuba as a soloist and with the ensemble, playing mostly 19th-century Romantic compositions. Although successful in Europe, Jiménez found his music was less accepted in Cuba. He toured the island and worked for a while as a music teacher in Trinidad, but in 1890 returned to Germany and settled in Hamburg, where he became active at the Weimar court. He was befriended by Franz Liszt, and became a director of the Hamburg Conservatory of Music. He was the first Cuban composer to work with the lied form. Jiménez married a German woman in 1899, Emma Filter, and had children Manuela, Adolfo and Andrea. Adolfo married Elisabeth Neubauer and they had one daughter, Carmen who became a foreign language teacher in New Jersey and California, teaching German and Spanish after getting her Masters Degree from New York University. Carmen married Leonard Friedman and they had two children, congero George Friedman-Jimenez, MD, DrPH and Julie Carmen an actress who also works as a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and a certified Yoga Therapist.

The country's first online magazine, Ger became a much-cited source on the effects of the transition to free markets and democracy the country experienced throughout the 1990s. Overview Ger was launched on September 9, 1998. The theme of youth in the transition was explored by a combined team of Mongolian and foreign journalists. The Ger Magazine project had basically three goals: first, raise the quality of journalism in the country, secondly, introduce the country to a wider global audience and, by being the country’s first online magazine, prove the internet was an effective way to communicate. Stories tackled the struggle to find work in the free market, the booming pop music scene and how it is leading the way in business entrepreneurship, reproductive health, the basics on Mongolian culture, and vox pop views from Mongolian youth. Issue 2 of the magazine investigated modern life in Mongolia during transition. Stories probed the proliferation of bars and the problem of alcoholism, corrupt banking practices and the loss of savings, how the young were the country's leading entrepreneurs, Mongolia's meat and milk diet, \\"girl power\\" and the strong role played by women, the burgeoning new media, the rise and rise of Buddhism, and Mongolia's dynamic fashion designers (this article inspired foreign fashion designers to embrace the Mongolian \\"look\\" in the next season's designs).

Jurin's law, or capillary rise, is the simplest analysis of capillary action—the induced motion of liquids in small channels—and states that the maximum height of a liquid in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the tube's diameter. Capillary action is one of the most common fluid mechanical effects explored in the field of microfluidics. Jurin's law is named after James Jurin, who discovered it between 1718 and 1719.See: * James Jurin (1718) \\"An account of some experiments shown before the Royal Society; with an enquiry into the cause of some of the ascent and suspension of water in capillary tubes,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 30 : 739–747. * James Jurin (1719) \\"An account of some new experiments, relating to the action of glass tubes upon water and quicksilver,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 30 : 1083–1096. His quantitative law suggests that the maximum height of liquid in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the tube's diameter. The difference in height between the surroundings of the tube and the inside, as well as the shape of the meniscus, are caused by capillary action. The mathematical expression of this law can be derived directly from hydrostatic principles and the Young–Laplace equation. Jurin's law allows the measurement of the surface tension of a liquid and can be used to derive the capillary length.  Formulation  The law is expressed as : \\\\qquad h = \\\\frac{2\\\\gamma \\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\rho gr_0} , where * h is the liquid height; * γ is the surface tension; * θ is the contact angle of the liquid on the tube wall; * ρ is the mass density (mass per unit volume); * r0 is the tube radius; * g is the gravitational acceleration. It is only valid if the tube is cylindrical and has a radius (r0) smaller than the capillary length (\\\\lambda_{\\\\rm c}^2=\\\\gamma/\\\\rho g). In terms of the capillary length, the law can be written as : \\\\lambda_{\\\\rm c}^2=\\\\frac{hr_0}{2\\\\cos\\\\theta} .  Examples  Water height in a capillary tube plotted against diameter. For a water-filled glass tube in air at standard conditions for temperature and pressure, at 20 °C, , and . For these values, the height of the water column is :h\\\\approx {{1.48 \\\\times 10^{-5}}\\\\over r_0} \\\\ \\\\mbox{m}. Thus for a radius glass tube in lab conditions given above, the water would rise an unnoticeable . However, for a radius tube, the water would rise , and for a radius tube, the water would rise . Capillary action is used by many plants to bring up water from the soil. For tall trees (larger than ~10 m (32 ft)), other processes like osmotic pressure and negative pressures are also important.  History  During the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci was one of the first to propose that mountain streams could result from the rise of water through small capillary cracks. It is later, in the 17th century, that the theories about the origin of capillary action begin to appear. Jacques Rohault erroneously supposed that the rise of the liquid in a capillary could be due to the suppression of air inside and the creation of a vacuum. The astronomer Geminiano Montanari was one of the first to compare the capillary action to the circulation of sap in plants. Additionally, the experiments of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli determined in 1670 that the height of the rise was inversely proportional to the radius of the tube. Francis Hauksbee, in 1713, refuted the theory of Rohault through a series of experiments on capillary action, a phenomenon that was observable in air as well as in vacuum. Hauksbee also demonstrated that the liquid rise appeared on different geometries (not only circular cross sections), and on different liquids and tube materials, and showed that there was no dependence on the thickness of the tube walls. Isaac Newton reported the experiments of Hauskbee in his work Opticks but without attribution. It was the English physiologist James Jurin, who finally in 1718 confirmed the experiments of Borelli and the law was named in his honour.  Derivation  Scheme showing the relevant variables to the problem for a positive height. The height h of the liquid column in the tube is constrained by the hydrostatic pressure and by the surface tension. The following derivation is for a liquid that rises in the tube; for the opposite case when the liquid is below the reference level, the derivation is analogous but pressure differences may change sign. = Laplace pressure = Above the interface between the liquid and the surface, the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure p_{\\\\rm atm}. At the meniscus interface, due to the surface tension, there is a pressure difference of \\\\Delta p=p_{\\\\rm atm}-p_{\\\\rm int}, where p_{\\\\rm int}is the pressure on the convex side; and \\\\Delta p is known as Laplace pressure. If the tube has a circular section of radius r_0, and the meniscus has a spherical shape, the radius of curvature is r=r_0/\\\\cos\\\\theta, where \\\\theta is the contact angle. The Laplace pressure is then calculated according to the Young-Laplace equation:\\\\Delta p=\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma}{r}, where \\\\gamma is the surface tension. = Hydrostatic pressure = Outside and far from the tube, the liquid reaches a ground level in contact with the atmosphere. Liquids in communicating vessels have the same pressures at the same heights, so a point \\\\rm w, inside the tube, at the same liquid level as outside, would have the same pressure p_{\\\\rm w}=p_{\\\\rm atm}. Yet the pressure at this point follows a vertical pressure variation as :p_{\\\\rm w}=p_{\\\\rm int}+\\\\rho gh, where g is the gravitational acceleration and \\\\rho the density of the liquid. This equation means that the pressure at point \\\\rm w is the pressure at the interface plus the pressure due to the weight of the liquid column of height h. In this way, we can calculate the pressure at the convex interface p_{\\\\rm int}=p_{\\\\rm w}-\\\\rho g h=p_{\\\\rm atm}-\\\\rho g h. = Result at equlibrium = The hydrostatic analysis shows that \\\\Delta p=\\\\rho g h, combining this with the Laplace pressure calculation we have:\\\\rho g h =\\\\frac{2\\\\gamma \\\\cos\\\\theta}{r_0}, solving for h returns Jurin's law.

Burn centers are often used for the treatment and recovery of patients with more severe burns. The severity of a burn, and therefore whether a referral will be made after the patient is treated and stabilized, differs depending upon many factors, among them: the age of the victim (burns to infants and toddlers or to those over age 65 are generally more serious, particularly if the face, head, respiratory system, chest, abdomen, groin, or extremities are burned; those who are not in these age groups can be more affected if they are or were already ill, injured, or immunocompromised), the total body surface area that is burned (the rule of nines), if proper treatment and referrals are delayed or the wrong treatments are given, if the burns are of the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th degree (the bigger and deeper, the worse it is), the source (if it was due to a chemical, or from a scald, or fire, or radiation, the treatment regimen has to be modified appropriately), or if skin grafting is not feasible and/or important organs are harmed.

It is located west-southwest of Burns, Oregon. It was closed in 1974. Burns Air Force Station was established as part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. History The Station was activated on 8 June 1955 after the 634th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to Burns by the 9th Air Division. The squadron began operating an AN/MPS-7 search-radar set at this site atop Burns Butte, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. By 1959 this radar had been joined by a pair of AN/FPS-6 height- finder radars. An AN/FPS-7B radar replaced the AN/MPS-7 radar in 1960. During 1961 Burns AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-16 at Stead AFB, Nevada. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 634th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 March 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-118. Also in 1963, two AN/FPS-90s were performing height-finder duties. In 1965 an AN/FPS-66A search radar (relocated from Condon AFS, OR) replaced the AN/FPS-7B at the site. One AN/FPS-90 height-finder radar was retired in 1968. In addition to the main facility, Burns operated an AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Burns Junction, OR (M-118A) The 634th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated at Burns AFS on 30 September 1970 as a result of budget restrictions, and the general phase down of air defense radar stations. The squadron was later re-activated in 1972 at Lake Charles AFS, Louisiana. Today, what was Burns Air Force Station is abandoned. The site buildings stand deteriorated and heavily vandalized. It appears as a ghost town on top of the butte. As of about 2005 the building have been removed and the US Government came in and removed hazardous materials from the site.

By 1940 he had joined the R.A.F. and during the war saw active service in Africa, Egypt, Arabia and Burma, achieving the rank of flight lieutenant. In 1946 he emigrated to the Netherlands, where he had made friends, and there he began to translate English novels into Dutch, including works by Alan Sillitoe, Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch His first poetry collection, No Summer Song, appeared in 1949. He also contributed widely to Dutch newspapers and literary periodicals and, from 1960 onwards, was publishing English translations of modern Dutch poets and placing them in British literary magazines. In 1964 he moved back to England, continuing his literary work there until 1970, when he returned to the Netherlands. By the late 1990s he had placed at least 700 translations of Dutch poetry in English-language magazines. In 1966 he received the Martinus Nijhoff Prize for translation and in 1997 he was knighted by the Dutch government for his services to literature. His second poetry collection, A Way of Getting Through, appeared in 1995 and his last, The Brightness In Between, was published shortly before his death in 2000. Some of the poets whose work he translated into English include Rutger Kopland, Anton Korteweg, M. Vasalis, Hans Lodeizen, Gerrit Achterberg, Remco Campert, Tom van Deel, J. C.

In a study of 34 adolescents hospitalized with mania, there was an association between earlier age of onset and previous stimulant use, independent of ADHD. In a retrospective study of 80 adolescents hospitalized with bipolar disorder, 35% of patients had previously used stimulants and 44% had used antidepressants, where stimulant use was associated with worse hospitalization course. However, there is mixed research on these relationships.

Cognitive functioning Reviews have indicated that most individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but who are euthymic (not experiencing major depression or mania), do not show neuropsychological deficits on most tests. Meta-analyses have indicated, by averaging the variable findings of many studies, cognitive deficits on some measures of sustained attention, executive function and verbal memory, in terms of group averages. On some tests, functioning is superior; however, and sub-threshold mood states and psychiatric medications may account for some deficits. A 2010 study found that \\"excellent performance\\" at school at age 15–16 was associated in males with a higher rate of developing bipolar disorder, but so was the poorest performance. A 2005 study of young adult males found that poor performance on visuospatial tasks was associated with a higher rate of developing bipolar disorder, but so was high performance in arithmetic reasoning. Psychological studies of bipolar disorder have examined the development of a wide range of both the core symptoms of psychomotor activation and related clusterings of depression/anxiety, increased hedonic tone, irritability/aggression and sometimes psychosis. The existing evidence has been described as patchy in terms of quality but converging in a consistent manner. The findings suggest that the period leading up to mania is often characterized by depression and anxiety at first, with isolated sub- clinical symptoms of mania such as increased energy and racing thoughts. The latter increase and lead to increased activity levels, the more so if there is disruption in circadian rhythms or goal attainment events. There is some indication that once mania has begun to develop, social stressors, including criticism from significant others, can further contribute. There are also indications that individuals may hold certain beliefs about themselves, their internal states, and their social world (including striving to meet high standards despite it causing distress) that may make them vulnerable during changing mood states in the face of relevant life events. In addition, subtle frontal-temporal and subcortical difficulties in some individuals, related to planning, emotional regulation and attentional control, may play a role. Symptoms are often subthreshold and likely continuous with normal experience. Once (hypo)mania has developed, there is an overall increase in activation levels and impulsivity. Negative social reactions or advice may be taken less notice of, and a person may be more caught up in their own thoughts and interpretations, often along a theme of feeling criticised. There is some suggestion that the mood variation in bipolar disorder may not be cyclical as often assumed, nor completely random, but results from a complex interaction between internal and external variables unfolding over time; there is mixed evidence as to whether relevant life events are found more often in early than later episodes. Many sufferers report inexplicably varied cyclical patterns, however.Manic-depressive illness FK Goodwin, KR Jamison – 1990 – Oxford University Press New York A series of authors have described mania or hypomania as being related to a high motivation to achieve, ambitious goal- setting, and sometimes high achievement. One study indicated that the pursuit of goals, encouraged by sometimes achieving them, can become emotionally dysregulated and involve the development of mania. Individuals may have low self-esteem and difficulties in social adjustment. Bipolar disorder has been associated with people involved in the arts but it is an ongoing question as to whether many creative geniuses had bipolar disorder.Jamison, K R, Touched with Fire, Free Press, 1993, pp 83 ff.Goodwin, F, and Jamison, K R, Manic- Depressive Illness, Oxford University Press, 1990, p 353 Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and creativity, although it is unclear in which direction the cause lies or whether both conditions are caused by a third unknown factor; temperament has been hypothesized to be one such factor. The individual's attachment to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to ambivalence about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment.American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington, VA, American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 136. Substance use Often bipolar individuals are subject to self-medication with non-prescribed drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs. There is some evidence that the subset of bipolar patients with a history of psychosis may smoke more heavily than the general population.

The main source about him is Procopius.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 267  Biography  Calonymus was probably a native of Alexandria, capital of the Diocese of Egypt. In 533, he was assigned as the sole commander of the Byzantine navy during the Vandalic War. Its mission was to transport the troops of Belisarius to the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa. Procopius reports in detail the naval force assembled: \\"And for the whole force five hundred ships were required, no one of which was able to carry more than fifty thousand medimni, nor any one less than three thousand. And in all the vessels together there were thirty thousand sailors, Egyptians and Ionians for the most part, and Cilicians, and one commander was appointed over all the ships, Calonymus of Alexandria. And they had also ships of war prepared as for sea-fighting, to the number of ninety-two, and they were single-banked ships covered by decks, in order that the men rowing them might if possible not be exposed to the bolts of the enemy. Such boats are called \\"dromones\\" by those of the present time; for they are able to attain a great speed. In these sailed two thousand men of Byzantium, who were all rowers as well as fighting men; for there was not a single superfluous man among them.\\"Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 3, Chapter 11 While this passage fails to give him a specific title, a later one calls him navarch (\\"leader of the ships\\", admiral). Said passage reads: \\"As we proceeded from there it was impossible to discern the ships. For high rocks extending well into the sea cause mariners to make a great circuit, and there is a projecting headland, inside of which lies the town of Hermes. Belisarius therefore commanded Archelaus, the prefect, and Calonymus, the admiral, not to put in at Carthage, but to remain about two hundred stades away until he himself should summon them. And departing from Grasse we came on the fourth day to Decimum, seventy stades distant from Carthage.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 3, Chapter 17 During the fall of Carthage, capital of the Vandal Kingdom, Calonymus reportedly looted the properties of the local merchants. He thus violated a standing order by Belisarius. Procopius narrates \\"Belisarius prevented the entrance [of soldiers] in order to guard against any ambuscade being set for his men by the enemy, and also to prevent the soldiers from having freedom to turn to plundering, as they might under the concealment of night. On that day, since an east wind arose for them, the ships reached the headland, and the Carthaginians, for they already sighted them, removed the defensive iron chains of the harbour which they call Mandracium, and made it possible for the fleet to enter. ... There they arrived about dusk and all anchored, except, indeed, that Calonymus with some of the sailors, disregarding the general and all the others, went off secretly to Mandracium, no one daring to hinder him, and plundered the property of the merchants dwelling on the sea, both foreigners and Carthaginians.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 3, Chapter 20 Calonymus testified to his own innocence under oath and was set free. Procopius asserts that Calonymus was actually guilty and got to keep whatever he had stolen. He returned safely to Constantinople, dying there of an apoplectic seizure. Procopius narrates: \\"On the following day Belisarius commanded those on the ships to disembark, and after marshalling the whole army and drawing it up in battle formation, he marched into Carthage; for he feared lest he should encounter some snare set by the enemy. There he reminded the soldiers at length of how much good fortune had come to them because they had displayed moderation toward the Libyans, and he exhorted them earnestly to preserve good order with the greatest care in Carthage. For all the Libyans had been Romans in earlier times and had come under the Vandals by no will of their own and had suffered many outrages at the hands of these barbarians. For this very reason the emperor had entered into war with the Vandals, and it was not holy that any harm should come from them to the people whose freedom they had made the ground for taking the field against the Vandals. ... And Belisarius bound Calonymus by oaths to bring without fail all his thefts to the light. And Calonymus, taking the oath and disregarding what he had sworn, for the moment made the money his plunder, but not long afterwards he paid his just penalty in Byzantium. For being taken with the disease called apoplexy, he became insane and bit off his own tongue and then died. But this happened at a later time.

In 1988, the company released its first version of Design-Expert software, which provided the tools for response surface methods (RSM) for process optimization. This package complemented Design-Ease, which handled factorial designs, and also provided statistical tools for optimizing mixtures in the chemical process industries. In 1996, the firm added the features of Design-Ease into Design-Expert version 5 and translated it from DOS to Windows. Both packages are still marketed today.Li He, Design of Experiments Software, The Chemical Information Network, July 17, 2003 In 1996, Forbes Magazine said the “new mantra” for process improvement is multivariate testing (MVT) and added: “A Minneapolis software firm, Stat-Ease, sells most of the software these MVT types use.”Rita Koselka, “The New Mantra: MVT,\\" Forbes, March 11, 1996. Felix Grant, reviewing Design- Expert version 7.1.3 in Scientific Computing Magazine said: “In a mature, well-established product which dominates its market, upgrades should be expected to reflect developing practice and display evolutionary growth rather than piling on attention-seeking gimmicks; and so it is here.... Core functions have been extended usefully... the design editor in Design-Expert (DX) has long been a strong point, providing a central cockpit from which to intuitively refine and test most aspects, but various new control features have now been added to the package, small in themselves but significantly enhancing productive control.”Felix Grant, “Design Expert 7.1,” Scientific Computing World, October 2007. Statistical design of experiments Minimum- Run Resolution IV and Minimum-Run Resolution V experimental designs were invented by Pat Whitcomb and Gary Oehlert in 2004.Pat Whitcomb, Mark Anderson, “Screening Process Factors in the Presence of Interactions,” American Society for Quality, 58th Annual Quality Congress, Session W202, 2004. Minimum-run resolution IV (“MR4”) factorial designs estimate all main effects, clear of two-factor or higher interactions, in a minimum of experimental runs. MR4 designs work well for factor screening. Minimum-run resolution V (“MR5”) factorial designs estimate all main effects and two-factor interactions in a minimum of experimental runs. MR5 designs are typically done after screening to a vital few factors, which then need to be studied in more depth in case they interact.“Small, Efficient, Equireplicated Resolution V Fractions…” by Gary W.

Regional groups make contact with the Alemannic language groups in Alsace, Switzerland, Liechtenstein und Vorarlberg by excursions as well as invitations of Alemannic poets and troubardours.Stefan Pflaum: Muettersproch-Gsellschaft im Kontakt mit dem Elsass und der Schweiz. In: Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, Heft 2/2014, p. 24-25. = Members meeting = Members meeting is held every year in another city. The official agenda concentrates on account, report of activities and acceptance of the accounts. If necessary, an election of a new board is held, then follow proposals and prospects. Cultural activities are additional to the official part.Quelle: Iiladig zue de Mitgliederversammlung 2014 vu de Muettersproch-Gsellschaft. Am Samschdig, 5.

Core activities  The Muettersproch-Gsellschaft today are involved with several activities which serve to increase awareness of the organisation while simultaneously rewarding people who support the dialect. Their operations actively work to promote the dialect and to educate people who might otherwise view Alemannic in a pejorative light. They also seek to demonstrate that the dialect has purpose and value for those who can claim it as part of their heritage. Klaus Poppen, president of the MSG from 1972 through to 2002, has had significant influence over the way the society is and operates today. Among their core activities are the following: * The society has published several anthologies of poetry. * They produce the popular sticker \\"Bi uns cha me au alemannisch schwätze\\" (engl. Here you can speak Alemannic too). * In 1982 they collected 37,000 signatures in a campaign for increased use of the dialect in radio and television broadcasts. * The Muettersproch-Gsellschaft regularly organises competitions, such as the lyrics and prose competition \\"Mir sueche die Beschte\\" (engl. We are looking for the best) in 2004, which they had organised in coordination with the newspaper Badische Zeitung and the public broadcaster Südwestrundfunk. * They organise seminars on poetry composition, public speaking and other topics in which their members can gain new knowledge and skills in their dialect. * They publish the magazine Alemannisch dunkt üs guet bi-annually, which is sent out to all members and also partially available from their website. * The Muettersproch-Gsellschaft awards the prize Alemannen-Antenne in irregular intervals, which recognises individuals from radio and television who have shown commitment to the Alemannic dialect. = Alemannic authors and songwriters = About 100 authors of alemannic tongue are part of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft. Songwriters in the Alemannic language are members as well.Muettersproch-Gsellschaft: Wer mir sin. Was mir welle. Warum mir s welle. Wie mir s mache. Gutenbergdruckerei Benedikt Oberkirch, Freiburg 2009, pp. 12–13 The societies Muettersproch-Gsellschaft and Landesverein Badische Heimat published an Alemannic dictionary (Alemannisches Wörterbuch) and a songbook (Alemannisches Liederbuch).Rudolf Post und Friedel Scheer-Nahor: Alemannisches Wörterbuch für Baden.

Gutenbergdruckerei Benedikt Oberkirch, Freiburg 2009, S. 21 = Dialect at school (Mundart in der Schule) = The society's goal is to get school children in Baden-Württemberg accustomed to the regional dialects Fränkisch, Schwäbisch and Alemannic. School classes and project groups can invite one of about 60 authors and songwriters to present their wisdom of idioms and dialects in lessons of two hours. An inventory of each artists capabilities is contained in the pamphlet Mundart in der Schule. In this way different forms and rhythms of dialect can be put in perspective as varieties of the German language.Website of the association Mundart in der Schule Organisation of these contacts is done by Muettersproch-Gsellschaft e.

Problems faced by the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft  = Use of Alemannic as a Political Instrument = In connection with the so- called \\"Dialect Wave\\" of the 70s and its connection to the anti-nuclear movement in Wyhl, it came to a split in the position of the MSG's membership. The society's board argued vehemently against political instrumentalisation of the dialect, while activists in the movement sought to actively strengthen both their association with the local people and their assertion of local rights through prominent use of the regional dialect.Noth, H. (2000) S Kriägsbeil. In: Badische Zeitung, 23. September 2000. Available: = Generational Change = There is ongoing concern among the membership and board of the society regarding the future of both the society and the Alemannic dialects. While it is an express goal of the society to preserve the dialects, Alemannic suffers from an acutely ageing speaker population as the language is frequently not passed on to the younger generation or its maintenance neglected by young speakers, leading to generational language loss. This is also the principal reason the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger currently categorises Alemannic as vulnerable despite speaker estimates ranging in the millions.http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language- id-1011.html The society is thus faced with the problem of encouraging parents to pass on the language as well as keeping young people engaged and interested in the language. The society has so far attempted to effect this through a variety of measures ranging from competitions for the youth to the use of rock music. They are also regularly organising in-school sessions, in which active members from the society (mainly authors and poets) design a short curriculum on Alemannic language and culture which they then teach over two lessons. The society has thus far perceived this program as greatly successful.(de) Internetseite des Arbeitskreises Mundart in der Schule(de) Internetseite schwäbische mund.art e.V. The MSG also makes itself available as a platform to the younger generation through which they can present their own projects relating to Alemannic language and culture.

Ashdown Forest lies within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, \\"...one of the best surviving, intact medieval landscapes in Northern Europe\\",http://www.highweald.org characterised by rolling hills, steep-sided ghyll streams, sandstone outcrops, nationally high woodland cover, many interconnected ancient woods, narrow sunken lanes, scattered farmsteads and hamlets, small irregular-shaped fields, and open heaths, of which Ashdown is the greatest example. The forest's distinctive open heathland landscape with its hilltop clumps of conifer trees has been immortalised in the illustrations provided by EH Shepard for the Winnie-the- Pooh stories of A. A. Milne, who lived on the northern edge of the forest at Chuck Hatch. Influences on the forest landscape and ecology =Influence of geology and climate= Ashdown Forest's landscape is greatly influenced by its underlying geology, which is mostly the sandstone and siltstone strata of the Ashdown Sands, part of the Hastings Beds formation. This, when combined with a local climate that is generally wetter, cooler and windier than the surrounding area owing to the forest's elevation, rising from to over above sea level, give rise to sandy, largely podzolic soils that are characteristically acid, clay, and nutrient-poor.Leslie and Short (1999), pp. 4-5. These poor, infertile soils have favoured the development of heathland, valley mires and damp woodland. These conditions have never favoured cultivation and have been a barrier to agricultural improvement, but they have favoured hunting activities, woodland industries and extractive industries. =Impact of commoning and similar activities= Despite its attractive wild, unspoilt appearance, Ashdown Forest's landscape is essentially man-made. From medieval times until the mid-20th century the forest's commoners (and other local people who have, less legitimately, exploited the forest resources) played an important role in maintaining the forest's heathland through their exploitation of the forest's woods and heaths: grazing large numbers of livestock such as cattle and pigs, which suppressed the growth of trees and scrub, cutting down or paring trees or collecting windblown wood for use as firewood or for other purposes, cutting dead bracken for use as livestock bedding, burning patches of heathland, and so on. Large numbers of livestock are known to have been grazed on the forest at times; for example, at the end of the 13th century the commoners were turning out 2,000-3,000 cattle onto the forest, alongside the 1,000-2,000 deer that were also present,Strategic Forest Plan of the Board of Conservators of Ashdown Forest 2008-2016 while a 1297 document records that the forest was being grazed by almost 2,700 swine.Ashdown Forest and Its Inclosures. Ernest Straker The long-standing predominance of heathland over woodland on the forest may in fact owe much to human intervention over a much longer period of time, and in this respect it may reflect the development of heathland in Britain generally, where the earliest evidence of heathland dates to Mesolithic times, before the introduction of agriculture, and where the emergence of heathlands on a large- scale seems to have taken place in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages following the introduction of agriculture. Even in Anglo-Saxon times, heathland seems to have been much more prevalent than it is today (although it needs to be borne in mind that much English heathland has been lost to enclosures in just the last 200 years - which makes the survival of Ashdown's heathlands all the more significant). Indeed, according to Oliver Rackham, the beginnings of the Weald's heathlands, including Ashdown, which he terms a heathland forest, can be traced back to before the Norman Conquest.Rackham (1997), p.134. =Impact of the Tudor iron industry= The large local iron industry, which grew very rapidly in Tudor times and continued to flourish in the early Stuart period, had a major impact on the forest's landscape and ecology through its heavy exploitation of the forest's woodlands to feed the many local furnaces and forges. The loss of much of the tree cover from the fringes of the forest during the 16th century has been attributed at least in part to the rapid growth of the industry following the introduction from northern France of blast furnaces (from 1490 onwards) with their huge demand for charcoal. For example, large-scale tree cutting took place to feed the iron works of Ralph Hogge to the south of the forest between Buxted and Maresfield.Cleere and Crossley (1995) p.137. The loss of trees caused much public concern: as early as 1520 it was lamentedStraker (1940), p.123. that > \\"much of the King's woods were cut down and coled [turned into charcoal] for > the iron mills, and the Forest digged for Irne [iron] by which man and beast > be in jeopardy.\\" Although it has been argued by some that sustainable woodland management through coppicing would necessarily have been introduced in the Weald to maintain the supply of charcoal to the iron industry, it seems that locally the industry continued to heavily denude Ashdown Forest into the 17th century, so that by 1632Cleere and Crossley (1995) p.169. > \\"there was little great wood left, and by 1658 none, while by 1632 coppices > were slight and much affected by illicit cutting.\\" That the last documented reference to pannage, the customary right of commoners to drive their pigs onto the forest in the autumn to feed on acorns and beech mast, is in 1600, provides further evidence of the extent to which the oak and beech woodlands had been devastated. Although the iron industry's impact on the forest was curtailed by its rapid decline after the first quarter of the 17th century, followed by its disappearance at the beginning of the 18th, this was too late to save the ancient woodlands. Landscape history =Medieval period= In medieval times, when it was used by English kings and the nobility as a hunting ground for deer, Ashdown Forest probably contained large areas of heathland. This would not have been unusual, as many of England's medieval forests consisted predominantly of heathland, including some of the best-known ones. For example, Sherwood Forest, in the Midlands, which was first described as a forest in 1154, had at most one-third of its area recorded as woodland in Domesday Book, and by the end of the 13th century was a vast heath incorporating a number of woods and parks with no more than a quarter of it being woodland.Rackham (1997), p.140. But unlike other heathlands in England, which have largely disappeared in the last 200 years, Ashdown's has largely survived. It now represents one of England's most extensive and important areas of lowland heathland,Lowland Heathland with the associated distinctive, often rare, heathland flora and fauna. Ashdown Forest's 1,500 ha of lowland heathland make it the largest area of this threatened habitat in south-east England. =19th and 20th centuries= Ashdown Forest's landscape in the early 19th century was famously described by William Cobbett in his Sussex Journal entry of 8 January 1822:William Cobbett Rural Rides. Constable, London. 1982. > \\"At about three miles from Grinstead you come to a pretty village, called > Forest-Row, and then, on the road to Uckfield, you cross Ashurst (sic) > Forest, which is a heath, with here and there a few birch scrubs upon it, > verily the most villainously ugly spot I saw in England. This lasts you for > five miles, getting, if possible, uglier and uglier all the way, till, at > last, as if barren soil, nasty spewy gravel, heath and even that stunted, > were not enough, you see some rising spots, which instead of trees, present > you with black, ragged, hideous rocks.\\" At the start of the 20th century the forest was virtually treeless, apart from the picturesque clumps of Scots pine that had been planted on its hill-tops in the early 19th century and the woods remaining in its deeper valleys and ghylls, and its heathland was the largest in south-east England. However, after World War II a sharp decline in livestock grazing by the commoners owing to economic and social factors (see below) led to a rapid and substantial loss of heathland to scrub and trees, particularly birch and pine. The increasing amounts of road traffic across the forest, with the consequent loss of animals in road traffic collisions, also became a major deterrent to grazing, with the last of the free-ranging livestock of the commoners being removed in 1985. As a consequence the proportion of heathland in the forest has declined greatly in the last sixty years, from 90% in 1947 to 60% in 2007.

She is also the younger sister of another popular blogger, C. Jane Kendrick. Plane crash and recovery In 2008, Nielson was in a serious plane crash with her husband Christian and burned over 80% of her body. She was in a coma for three months and then underwent many operations, skin grafts, and physical therapy in a painful, ongoing treatment regimen. Her recovery process led to a large increase in publicity including interviews with Oprah Winfrey, Today, and a popular YouTube \\"Mormon Message\\" video for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A year after her accident, she hiked the \\"Y\\", a rocky path near her parents' house, with her family and dozens of fans to demonstrate how far she had come. Blogging style, fanbase, and appeal Nielson is known for her positive approach to life, especially motherhood, influenced in part by her strong religious convictions. Her fans credit her with inspiring them to become better mothers and for \\"portraying motherhood as a celebration, not a grind\\" as well as \\"...'the highest calling on earth: a job full of color and vibrancy and of the utmost importance.'\\" As with many other Mormon mommy bloggers, Nielson has attracted attention for her large base of readers who are either not Latter-Day-Saints, not mothers, or both. A Salon article entitled \\"Why I Can't Stop Reading Mormon Housewife Blogs\\", by Emily Matchar, a self-described \\"young, feminist atheist who can't bake a cupcake\\" but is \\"addicted\\" to several Latter-Day-Saint housewife blogs, including Nielson's, examined this interesting phenomena. :\\"So why, exactly, are these blogs so fascinating to women like us -- secular, childless women who may have never so much as baked a cupcake, let alone reupholstered our own ottomans with thrifted fabric and vintage grosgrain ribbon?...to use a word that makes me cringe, these blogs are weirdly \\"uplifting.\\" To read Mormon lifestyle blogs is to peer into a strange and fascinating world where the most fraught issues of modern living -- marriage and child rearing -- appear completely unproblematic. This seems practically subversive to someone like me, weaned on an endless media parade of fretful stories about \\"work-life balance\\" and soaring divorce rates and the perils of marrying too young/too old/too whatever.\\". In response, MMB (Mormon Mommy Blogs) argued that although the article was right that these blogs provided something missing in other people's lives, this missing piece was spiritual. :\\"We told the producer that it's easy to learn about people through their blogs. You are getting to peek inside their homes, you are getting to see how other people are living. And not only that, but those Mormons, that you've only heard weird myths about, are out there, talking, and you're finding, that they are regular people. These are regular women, who[m] you admire.

Photo taken in January 2006 Mehadrin bus lines () were a type of bus line in Israel that mostly ran in and/or between major Haredi population centers and in which gender segregation and other rigid religious rules observed by some ultra-Orthodox Jews were applied from 1997 until 2011. In these sex-segregated buses, female passengers sat in the back of the bus and entered and exited the bus through the back door if possible, while the male passengers sat in the front part of the bus and entered and exited through the front door. Additionally, \\"modest dress\\" was often required for women, playing a radio or secular music on the bus was avoided, advertisements were censored. Mehadrin lines were generally cheaper than other lines. In early 2010, there were 56 Mehadrin buses in 28 cities across Israel operated by public transportation companies, although usually not specifically labelled. In January 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that gender segregation was unlawful and abolished the \\"mehadrin\\" public buses. However, the court rule allows the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period. Before the ruling, female passengers were frequently harassed and forced to sit at the back of the bus. Haredim requested to operate private bus lines, but they were blocked by the transportation ministry.Haredim request private buslines Advocacy groups who fought segregated bus lines claimed that discrimination against women in public buses was maintained one year later. Incidents in which women were ordered by ultra-Orthodox men to sit at the back of buses and were abused when they refused, have been reported. As of 2013, Haredim surrounded and stoned buses after the drivers explained to passengers that women cannot be forced to sit in the back, breaking windows until they were arrested;[Jpost http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-in-Bet-Shemesh- apprehend-haredi-man-for-demanding-woman-move-on-bus-321630] and [telchaination citing/linking to other news sources http://telchaination.blogspot.com/2013/07/beit-shemesh-haredis-riot-after- bus.html] a month later, a secular man punched, and pulled the beard of, a Haredi who tried to get a woman to move, then he escaped arrest.[failedmessiah http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2013/08/haredi-man-punched- by-secular-passenger-after-trying-to-illegally-coerce-gender-segregation-on- jerusalem-bus-567.html]  History  The so-called \\"mehadrin\\" bus lines were created in the late 1990s for the Haredi public. It began with two lines in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak in 1997. In fall 2001, Dan and Egged bus companies, in order to compete with private buses run by Haredim, had come to an agreement with the ultra-Orthodox Mehadrin Council. In 2007, there were an estimated thirty \\"mehadrin\\" buses operated by public transportation companies, in early 2010 the number had risen to more than fifty. In July 2004, American-Israeli novelist Naomi Ragen unintentionally boarded a \\"mehadrin\\" bus toward her home in Ramot and was physically threatened for refusing to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. In 2006, \\"mehadrin\\" buses were heavily criticized in the media worldwide after an American Jewish woman, Miriam Shear, reported being attacked and beaten by a group of ultra-Orthodox men after refusing to move to the back of the bus on a non-segregated line. Shear and another male passenger accused the bus driver of \\"doing nothing\\" during the attack, while the bus driver claimed to have stopped the bus to inform the men surrounding Shear that his line was not sex-segregated. Critics likened the \\"mehadrin\\" lines to racial segregation in the United States, with Shear compared to African American icon Rosa Parks. According to a survey conducted by the Smith Research Institute in Summer 2010 for the organization Hiddush, 70% of Jewish Israelis, male and female, support abolishing or reducing the gender- segregated public bus lines. 40% support complete abolishment, 30% are in favor of reducing their number and 22% support continuing the arrangement as it was at the time of the survey. Only 8% supports further expanding gender- separated transportation services. Among those supporting the abolition or reduction of gender-segregated public bus lines are 75% of Likud voters, 76% of Yisrael Beytenu voters, and 88% of Kadima voters. A Jerusalem Post online poll found that 76% of those who responded did not approve of segregated buses, 6% approved and 18% said that segregation should only exist in lines that operate in Haredi neighborhoods.  Petition and court ruling  Sticker at top reads: \\"Every passenger may sit wherever s/he chooses (except seats designated for disabled persons), harassing a passenger in this regard may be a criminal offense\\". (June 2011) In 2007, the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), an organization close to Israel's Reform movement, together with several women who were harassed while traveling on gender-segregated buses (including Shear and Ragen), submitted a petition demanding the introduction of alternative lines without gender segregation and requiring the authorities to ensure the safety of female passengers. The Ministry of Transportation replied that the gender segregation is a \\"voluntary arrangement\\" and that the ministry did not intend to intervene. In January 2008, the Supreme Court recommended that the Ministry of Transportation appoint a committee to examine the matter. In its report published in October 2009, the committee came to the conclusion that gender segregation in public buses is illegal and that arrangements in public transportation that include segregation, inherently entail a dimension of coercion. The committee's main recommendation was to introduce a temporary arrangement on the bus lines that had imposed gender segregation, in which both the door in front and in the back would be opened at the bus stops, instead of just the door in front, as customary in Israel, giving women the possibility to use the back door and sit in the back, but that each passenger, male or female, could choose where to sit with no defined segregation, and no specific seating arrangement would be enforced. Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, in an affidavit to the High Court, said in February 2010, that the state would not tolerate the use of threats and violence to enforce the separation. However, he suggested, that bus operators should be permitted to hang \\"behavior-directing\\" signs asking passengers to sit separately, but indicating that this is not mandatory. According to the state, who was required to monitor these buses, there were no problems, but data collected by IRAC showed numerous cases of abuse, harassment, and even women being denied entrance to the bus. In its ruling on January 6, 2011, the High Court of Israel did not allow the creation of additional segregated lines and ruled that gender segregation was illegal and ordered that signs designating buses as segregated were to be removed and new signs to be put up informing passengers that they had the right to sit wherever they wanted, and stressed that neither passengers nor the driver could pressure anyone into complying with a segregated seating arrangement. In his ruling, Supreme Court Justice Elyakim Rubinstein wrote: \\"A public transportation company (like any other person) cannot say, ask or order women where to sit on a bus simply because they are women, nor what they should wear, and they are entitled to sit anywhere they wish. Of course, this also applies to the men, but for reasons that are obvious, the complaints have to do with the harmful behavior toward women.\\" And he added: \\"As I now read over these lines emphasizing this I am astounded that there was even a need to write them in the year 2010. Have the days of Rosa Parks, the African American woman who collapsed the racist segregation on an Alabama bus in 1955 returned?\\" In a one-year experiment to see whether a voluntary segregation system could function, about 50 bus lines, serving both inter and inner city, are registered under the High Court of Justice as lines in which voluntary segregation is followed. They reportedly operate in and between ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods with a Hasidic majority. The Egged bus company was also ordered to publish ads about the cancellation of the \\"mehadrin\\" gender-separation arrangement in three daily publications, including at least one haredi newspaper. In February 2011, the Jerusalem Post reported that all haredi newspapers had refused to publish the ads. One of them even presented the High Court's decision \\"as a victory, enshrining the arrangement\\".  Enforcement  Fearing that the court's orders might not be properly enforced by the bus companies, IRAC launched a year-long Rosa Parks- inspired Freedom Rider project. Foreign and local female volunteers will be assigned a bus route that has been considered \\"mehadrin\\" until the court's ruling, and will sit in the front section of the buses which used to be reserved for men. In early June 2011, Haaretz reported that Egged allegedly violated the Supreme Court ruling. According to the report, a haredi magazine published an ad describing arrangements for gender segregation on Egged buses linking Ashdod and Jerusalem for the holiday of Shavuot. The ad announced separate buses for families and for men only, accompanied by a supervisor on board. Egged called the announcement \\"a forgery which was done without the knowledge of Egged\\", affirming that there is no \\"mehadrin\\" concept on their buses and that the company \\"operates only in line with Supreme Court instructions and allows every passenger to select his seat without gender discrimination.\\" If there were only men on a bus, it was \\"because there was no demand by women, and not because there were instructions from anyone which prevented the travel of women\\", according to the bus company. The head of the Free Israel movement which fights segregated bus lines doubts this, and claims that \\"Egged and the Ministry of Transportation ... use any means, to cooperate with the Haredi politicians in order not to carry out the Supreme Court decision, and in essence maintain these bus lines which discriminate against women\\". On December 17, 2011, Tanya Rosenblit, a secular Israeli woman, refused to move to the back of Egged bus 451 from Ashdod to Jerusalem, where women commonly sit in the back, when told to by a Haredi man, who allegedly called her a shikse, a derogatory word for a non-Jewish woman. A policeman called to the scene by the busdriver, instead of explaining the law to the offending man, asked Rosenblit to move to the back. The incident made headlines both in Israeli and international media, and Rosenblit was hailed as \\"Israeli Rosa Parks\\". According to an Egged spokesperson, who condemned the incident, the number of such incidents is increasing. On December 28, 2011, on city bus line 49A in Jerusalem's Ramat Eshkol neighborhood, a Haredi man allegedly asked Doron Matalon, a female IDF soldier at the time, to move to the back of the bus. When she refused, he allegedly called her a \\"slut\\" and continued to harass her until the driver called the police. The man was arrested and charged with sexual harassment and unruly misconduct in a public place before being released on bail.  Response  On December 3, 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking to a closed forum in Washington, expressed concern about Israel's democracy and shock over discrimination against Israeli women, some of which she said reminded her of Iran, mentioning among other examples that females sit in the back of buses in certain places in Israel. Members of the Israeli government denied that there is any justification in Clinton's criticism of Israeli democracy. However, finance minister Yuval Steinitz agreed that \\"the matter of excluding and segregating women is completely unacceptable and needs to be put to a stop\\", and environmental protection minister Gilad Erdan said he shares \\"the concern over the dignity of women\\", adding that \\"the government should take steps to demonstrate its commitment to equality between men and women\\". On the Sunday after the incident on Egged bus 451 on December 17, 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the weekly cabinet meeting: \\"I heard about an incident in which a woman was moved on a bus. I adamantly oppose this. Fringe groups must not be allowed to tear apart our common denominator. We must preserve public space as open and safe for all citizens of Israel\\". Opposition leader Tzipi Livni made a personal call to Tanya Rosenblit and praised her for her \\"personal bravery\\", stating that \\"her determination symbolizes the need for all of us who fear for Israel′s image to fight and not give in\\". Rosenblit was invited to testify before an inter- ministerial committee headed by Culture and Sports Minister Limor Livnat that is to develop a government action plan dealing with the exclusion of women in public places.” Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger declared on an ultra- Orthodox radio station that \\"if we want there to be segregation, it would be most legitimate for us to create a special bus company for these specific lines, so that we can be their 'landlords'. But as long as they pay as we do, and it is a public company that serves not only the ultra-Orthodox sector, what can we do?\\" Even close associates of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, a leading rabbi of the non-Hasidic ultra-Orthodoxy in Israel, who is signatory to a kol koreh in favor of bus segregation, declare to the media that they oppose forced segregation.

It is located west of Condon, Oregon. It was closed in 1970. History Condon AFS was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 636th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the station on 15 August 1951,Cornett & Johnson, p. 155 and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. By 1952 the squadron was operating AN/FPS-3 search and AN/FPS-4 height-finder radars at Condon. These sets were replaced in 1957 and 1958 with AN/FPS-20 and AN/FPS-6 radars. In 1959 a second height-finder radar came with the installation of an AN/FPS-6A. During 1960 Condon AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-15 at Larson AFB, Washington. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 636th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 8 September 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction, altitude, speed, and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. The AN/FPS-20 subsequently was upgraded in 1961 and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-32. In 1964 an AN/FPS-27 search radar was installed and in 1965 the AN/FPS-66 was relocated to Burns AFS, OR, to replace the AN/FPS-7B search radar there. The Air Force inactivated the 636th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 30 September 1970 as a result of budget restrictions, and the general phase down of air defense radar stations. Most of the site has been redeveloped for commercial use, the housing area being used as single-family homes.

The cheese takes its name from La Alpujarra (or Las Alpujarras), a mountainous region which occupies a part of southern Granada province and western Almeria province. This area has a long history and tradition of goatherding. Alpujarras cheese is made from the milk of the White Andalusian domesticated goat. The cheese is made as a fresh or matured variety and is classified as fatty to extra fatty. The presentation of the mature cheese is in the form of cylinders, rather wider than they are high. The rind faces are usually marked with patterns of flowers and the sides with lines, which are intended to simulate the imprint of rushes, including the authorising mark of the protected designation of origin P.D.O. The cheese is sold in pieces of between . if fresh, and up to if cured. Manufacturing process Made from fresh milk which is aromatic and high in fats, the milk is pasteurised if used for fresh cheese but left raw if used for cured cheese. The milk is curdled with rennet from young goats which gives the best result and gives the final cheese the best possible qualities. The milk is heated to 30-32 °C and the rennet is added. The coagulation takes between 30 and 45 minutes but can sometimes take up to two hours. The curd is then cut with a so-called lyre into pieces about the size of a pea or bean to facilitate the draining of the whey. It is left to rest for a few minutes before the moulding process where the curd is put into baskets, in old times made of rushes but nowadays made of more hygienic plastic. These baskets have, on their inner surface, the imprints that will show on the rind of the cheese. After 48 hours of pressing they are salted by being placed in an 18% brine at a temperature of 12-14 °C for about 24 hours. The cheeses are then placed in ventilated, high-humidity rooms at 10-12 °C to mature. The fresh cheese can be eaten within 60 days but the mature cheese must remain for at least 60 days and sometimes may be left for up to 4 months. Characteristics This is a cheese with a strong flavour, it has a lacteal base, slightly salty and a little peppery. It is buttery to the palate from the high level of fat it contains. The flavour may vary a little depending on the time of year it was made. The fresh cheese is a little sweeter and more milky. It is not recommended that this cheese is eaten after about 9 months due to the degradation of the fats and the release of caproic fatty acids that will affect the flavour. =Texture= The mature cheese has a firm, non-elastic texture, typical of the way this kind of cheese is made and there are often little cavities evenly spaced throughout the cheese. The color is a matte, ivory-white. The fresh cheese is soft and a shiny white. =Rind= The rind is normally natural, clean and a yellowy straw colour. It may be oiled with olive oil. After maturation the rind can turn dark brownish with possibly some green flecks caused by moulds growing on the surface. Fresh cheese has no appreciable rind. Uses It is recommended that Alpujarra cheese is eaten with white wine of the Jumilla or Cariñena variety, it also goes well with Amontillado and fino sherry. It can be enjoyed as an accompaniment to a range of dishes and is also enjoyable to eat with dried fruit and nuts. Fresh cheese is commonly eaten sliced and grilled as a starter.

The monument was constructed in 1886 to a design by Vilhelm Dahlerup. Ferdinand Edvard Ring was responsible for the statue of the Roman goddess of victory, Victoria, and for the reliefs, while Carl Brummer undertook the monument's architectonic design. Background On 4 October 1710, the ship-of-the-line Dannebrog, which Huitfeldt commanded, was set on fire during an encounter with the Swedes. He gave orders to continue the battle, which only came to an end when the ship blew up. Huitfeldt and 497 crew members were killed. Between 1872 and 1875 various artifacts were brought up from the wreck, including cannons and the ship's anchor. Design The top The base The monument consists of a marble column placed on a tall granite base and topped by a statue of Victoria. It stands approximately 19 metres tall and measures 3.377 x 3.77 metres at the base. Four bronze reliefs on the base of the monument, one oin each side, feature Huitfeldt 's portrait, his coat of arms, his ship and a short text.

History The Ivar Huitfeldt Column in c. 1890 Drawing from 1896 The initial plans for a Huitfeldt memorial called for a much smaller monument, a sort of cairn, but after the intervention of Carlsberg brewer Carl Jacobsen who had already sponsored several monuments in Copenhagen, including a statue of Admiral Niels Juel next to the National Bank, it was decided to launch a design competition. It was won by Vilhelm Dahlerup. The original plan was to erect the monument at the small churchyard attached to the naval Church of Holmen, close to the main entrance in Havnegade, but Dahlerup's monument was ultimately deemed too big for the site. The bronze components were cast in C.F. Holm's bronze foundry at Gammel Mønt.

It is serialized in Shueisha's monthly shōjo manga magazine Ribon, and had been published into fourteen tankōbon volumes. The name of the series is a pun between \\"Hiyoko\\" (, which means \\"chick\\") and \\"Koi\\" (, which means \\"love\\"). A twenty-two-minute-long movie based on the manga and produced by Production I.G. was released in the Ribon Summer festival in July 30, 2010. The movie was later released on a DVD along with the Yumeiro Patissiere OVA. Plot Hiyori Nishiyama is a 15-year-old girl who is extremely short. After being in an accident that caused her bones to stop growing, she starts going to high school as a freshman, along with her best friend Ritsuka. In her class there is a boy whose name is Yuushin Hirose and becomes Hiyori's friend (despite the fact that Hiyori is not very happy with his height or his constant happy attitude). After an accident where her panties were shown to the class, she starts growing closer to Yuushin. Characters ; : A 15-year-old girl on first year of high school. She has a height of 140 centimeters and is very shy, because she doesn't want people to pick on her. She is referred to as cute by her classmates, especially by Natsuki and Yuushin. Her best friend is Ritsuka, who she has known since kindergarten. Her nicknames are Hiyo (used by Ritsuka) and Hiyorin (used by Yuushin and other classmates). Hiyori admires Yuushin because he can make friends easily, while she can't. Later, she falls in love with him. Hiyori also has a cat named Puipui, which was found by Yuushin on the school grounds. She starts to become closer to Yuushin and finally confesses her feelings at the fireworks festival. ; : A 16-year-old boy in his first year of high school and in the same class as Hiyori. He has a height of 190 centimeters, thus his relationship with Hiyori is referred as a \\"reverse Lovely Complex\\". He is very popular and has a lot of friends, and is normally seen smiling. Though he is very popular, Yuushin does not have a girlfriend. He does not accept any honmei chocolate and rejects confessions as politely as possible. Yuushin spends most of his classes sleeping or eating, which annoys Hiyori. He seems to have feelings for Hiyori. When Hiyori confesses he is about to reply but is interrupted by one of his friends. They do not talk to each other until days later during summer break, where he confesses and asks her to go out with him. ; : A 15-year-old girl and Hiyori's best friend. She is the person who encouraged Hiyori to become more sociable and start going to school again. Hiyori calls her Ri-chan. Her most notable feature is her red twintails. She is a part of the archery club, and prefers a guy who \\"will not die even if an arrow pierces his heart.\\" An extra side story reveals that Ritsuka was very popular with boys in middle school and wondered what it would be like to love someone and to have a boyfriend. A boy confessed to her and she goes to the fireworks festival with him. However he says something about Hiyori that Ritsuka finds rude, and she hits him in the face with her bag. She runs to Hiyori's house and says that right now Hiyori is the one she loves the most and then tells Hiyori that if she ever falls in love, Hiyori will be the first to know. It is revealed later in the manga that she have feelings for Kou. ; : A 15-year-old girl who is Hiyori and Yuushin's classmate. She loves cute things and is one of the people who thinks Hiyori is cute. She has been classmates with Yuushin since middle school. It is revealed that Natsuki had a crush on her homeroom teacher back in her last year in middle school, but when she learned he was married she was heartbroken, so she cut her hair. Natsuki decided that she will only grow her hair when she has found someone that she loves. Her birthday is on July 18. She starts to cry when Hiyori goes out with Yuushin and is seen saying \\"Hiyori, I wish you the best\\", and her classmates comment that she looks like a girl who got her heart broken. She is in Hiyori's homeroom class during her first and second year and is one of Hiyori's close friends. ; : Kisaki is a former classmate of Yuushin's. She confessed to Yuushin when they were young, but it is unknown what he said to her. She asked Hiyori to deliver some Valentine's chocolate to Yuushin, but Hiyori broke down and couldn't do it. Kisaki attends a prestigious school. She is very beautiful, and has a 'short person complex' (she envies short people like Hiyori). She later moves to England as her dad's job is transferred there. She doesn't tell Yuushin when her flight is, but Hiyori finds out and goes with Yushin to say one last goodbye. She later sends a postcard to Yuushin and Hiyori and tells Hiyori to become closer to Yushin, as he may be taken by someone else if she doesn't, revealing that Kisaki has gotten over her crush and wants Hiyori to be with Yuushin. ; : Kou is one of Hiyori's classmates in her second year, and sits beside her in class. He has a similar personality and height to Hiyori, causing him to constantly be teased about being perfect for Hiyori during his first year. When he first met Hiyori, he disliked her because he thought that she had a calculating personality, and believed that Hiyori was an attention seeking person. He eventually becomes one of Hiyori's good friends. He does not enjoy school trips. He later meets Ri-chan who he finds weird, and notices that she eats a lot. Hiyori thinks that Kou and Ri-chan would look good as a couple. Near the end of Chapter 24, it is seen that he has developed feelings for Hiyori, and shows he is thinking of her relationship with Yuushin. At the end of Chapter 37, he confesses to Hiyori. ; : Reina is Hiyori's second year classmate, but is a year older because she is a returning student from the United States. She is a happy-go-lucky girl, and isn't afraid to speak her mind. She sits beside Yuushin in class, and has a crush on him, which the entire class (including Yuushin) is aware of. She considers Hiyori her rival and comrade, because they were both 'rejected' by Yuushin, although Hiyori has not yet given Yuushin a direct confession. She also told Yuushin that Hiyori and Kou looked good together. It is revealed that she wasn't always so outspoken and was very shy in her first year of high school, so she moved abroad to study and sees Hiyori as the 'past her'. She dresses Hiyori up for the fireworks display and is happy that Yuushin and Hiyori are going out. She has a boyfriend from America, which shocks everyone as she says she likes Yuushin. She tells Yushin that she loves her boyfriend and him the same amount. ; : Yuushin and Hiyori's first and second year homeroom teacher. She is 28 years old when the manga starts, and has a hard time finding a boyfriend, although she frequently goes to \\"kouko\\"s. She is affectionately called Mi-tan by her first year class. She has about three cats, all of whom have been saved and given to her by Yuushin. At the end of some chapters she has an after school diary where she talks about the classmates and her relationships in the past. One talks about when she confessed to a boy and they started going out. When he asks what she likes about him she replies with strange answers such as \\"the way you chew your food 20 times before swallowing\\", implying that she's been watching him and probably stalking him. He of course becomes creeped out and doesn't talk to her again. Another side chapter showed Yuushin and the homeroom class discussing why Mi-tan has had relationship problems, and showed an interview with a man who said that she is really pretty but when she gets drunk she becomes \\"annoying\\". Mi-tan says that she only drinks so that she can engage in conversation, and Yushin concludes the meeting by saying that Mi-tan's personal mistakes cause relationship problems.

Archbishop Ebbo (d. 851) promoted artistic production at the abbey at Hautvillers, near the city.

Early life  Although it is not known exactly where and when Uloqsaq was born, it is thought he was born around 1887, as he was about 30 during his murder trial in 1917.  The murders  In late 1913, Jean-Baptiste Rouvière and Guillaume Le Roux, two Missionary Oblates, were on a mission to convert the Copper Inuit in the Coppermine River region to Roman Catholicism while heading towards Coronation Gulf. They were doing this, they claimed, because they had heard rumours that Anglican missionaries were attempting to perform the same in that region, and wanted to convert the Inuit in the area to their denomination first. The priests enlisted the assistance of Uloqsaq as well as Sinnisiak, another hunter, and paid them in traps. However, Le Roux, who had a short temper, quickly got angry with the two Inuit men, who soon decided that Le Roux's anger meant that the priests wanted to kill them. Sinnisiak urged Uloqsaq to help him kill the two men, and the priests were shot, stabbed and axed to death. For ritualistic reasons, the two Inuit ate a portion of the two priests' livers. Some Inuit later told the investigating policemen a different story. One man, an Inuit elder named Koeha, told the story quite differently. He claimed that at an Inuit camp, a man had stolen a rifle from one of the priests and gotten into a fight with Le Roux. Although the Inuit who had stolen the weapon wanted to kill Le Roux, the priests managed to escape. Sinnisiak and Uloqsaq began to follow the priests, and caught up with them at Bloody Falls, where Sinnisiak stabbed and shot the two men. Although Uloqsaq assisted on Sinnisiak's urging, he said that he did not want to kill the priest and only did so because he had been told to by Sinnisiak.  Investigation and trial  A Royal North-West Mounted Police investigation began after word reached Fort Norman that Inuit had been seen wearing the priests' clothing, and the two men surrendered themselves without incident in May 1916. Part of Uloqsaq's police statement read, \\"I wanted to speak; Ilogoak [Le Roux] put his hand over my mouth... Ilogoak pointed the gun at us. I was afraid and I was crying... Sinnisiak said to me 'We ought to kill these white men before they kill us.'\\" Partly due to a previous incident with similar circumstances following which no action was taken, the authorities wished to make an example out of the two Inuit men, and Sinnisiak was tried in Edmonton for the murder of Rouvière, largely because it was thought that Sinnisiak had been the 'ringleader'. He was found not guilty because the jury thought that the Inuit man had cause to kill the priest. Following the not guilty verdict, the two Inuit men were taken to Calgary in late August, where they were found guilty of the murder of Le Roux. This was the first time Inuit had been found guilty of murder in a Canadian court. The law at that time had a mandatory sentence of death for the crime of murder, yet the jury and the judge did not wish for the pair to die for their crimes owing to the provocative nature of the priests' actions before their deaths. To avoid the death penalty, the judge sentenced the pair to death by hanging, with the execution date set as October 15. The sentence was immediately commuted to life imprisonment at a Fort Resolution police station. In 1919, the pair assisted police in establishing a new police contingent at Tree River, and in 1922 were released.  Later life  By the late 1920s, Uloqsaq has established himself in Bernard Harbour, and was found unable to hunt due to spinal tuberculosis by the Anglican archdeacon Archibald Lang Fleming in 1928. The tuberculosis, which was most likely contracted during his time in prison, was part of an epidemic of the same sweeping Inuit populations in Canada at the time. Uloqsaq was taken to a hospital, but as the hospital was unable to provide for his long- term needs, he was taken home to the Coppermine River region, where he died in September 1929.

It is one of three motorcycles claimed to be the first motorcycle, along with the Roper steam velocipede of 1867 or 1868, and the internal combustion engine Daimler Reitwagen of 1885. Perreaux continued development of his steam cycle, and exhibited a tricycle version by 1884. The only Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede made, on loan from the Musée de l'Île- de-France, Sceaux, was the first machine viewers saw upon entering the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum rotunda in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York in 1998. First motorcycle? Motoring author L. J. K. Setright commented that, \\"the simplest way to define a motorcycle is as a bicycle propelled by a heat engine; and if we accept this we must go on to admit that its prototype is unidentifiable, shrouded in the mists of industrial antiquity.\\" Both the Michaux-Perreaux and Roper machines have been assigned years of origin of 1867, 1868, and 1869 by different authorities, and which combination of these three years is given to the two steam motorcycles determines whether it was a tie, or whether one can be called the first. Both steam cycles are rejected as the first motorcycle by other experts, such as Cycle World's Technical Editor Kevin Cameron, who either argue that a true motorcycle must use a gasoline internal combustion engine, or that the first motorcycle must use the same technology as the successful motorcycles that later went into mass production, and not a 'dead end'. They therefore give credit to Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler's 1885 Daimler Reitwagen. After the period of experimental steam and internal combustion motorcycles, the uncertainty dissolves on the question of the first production motorcycle. The liquid cooled four-stroke Hildebrand & Wolfmüller of 1894 was the first motorcycle produced in quantity and sold commercially. =Year of origin= Drawing from 1872 patent addition. The earliest year suggested for the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede is 1867, which could be either the same year, or earlier than the Roper velocipede, which some authorities also date as early as 1867, while others such as motorcycling historians Charles M. Falco and David Burgess-Wise, and Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr date the Roper later, to 1868, and the AMA Hall of Fame member and author Mick Walker have it as 1869. Walker also dates the Michaux-Perraux at 1869, declaring a tie. Louis-Guillaume Perreaux patented his steam velocipede on December 26, 1869, while Roper did not seek patents on any of his steam vehicles, and Daimler took out a patent for his Reitwagen on 29 August 1885. Classic Bike editor Hugo Wilson says because the Perreaux-Michaux has patents to verify its date, it has a stronger claim on being first than the Roper, even if they both probably appeared in about the same year. =Definition of first motorcycle= The Oxford English Dictionary and others include having an internal combustion engine as a criterion for a motorcycle. This definition of motorcycle worked for nearly the entire 20th century until electric motorcycles grew in prominence and were accepted as true motorcycles without question. A different tack in favor of the internal combustion Reitwagen is that it was the prototype for virtually all successful designs that followed, in so far as the powerplant is concerned. Cameron said, \\"History follows things that succeed, not things that fail.\\" Design columnist Glynn Kerr, ignoring the Michaux-Perraux altogether and championing the Roper, feels it would be more accurate to call the Daimler Reitwagen, \\"the predecessor of all gasoline-driven vehicles on land, sea, or air\\", but not a true motorcycle because it used two outrigger wheels to remain upright and could not lean. Further, Kerr notes the design was not up to the standards Daimler and Maybach's engineering skill, because they had no interest at the time in motorcycles, but only wanted an expedient test bed for their engine, and immediately dropped the Reitwagen in favor of a four wheeled stagecoach, a hot air balloon and a boat for their ongoing research. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed \\"a crude makeshift\\", saying that \\"as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date.\\" Development The Michaux velocipede had a straight downtube and a spoon brake. Pierre Michaux's son Ernest is credited by L. J. K. Setright and David Burgess-Wise as having first fitted the Perreaux patented engine to the velocipede, while Charles M. Falco says it was Louis-Guillaume Perreaux. The Michaux-Perreaux machine was constructed using the first commercially successful pedal bicycle, a boneshaker which Michaux had been building over 400 of annually since 1863, and the single cylinder alcohol fueled Perreaux engine, which used twin flexible leather belt drives to the rear wheel. A steam pressure gauge was mounted in the rider's view above the front wheel, and steam to the cylinder was engaged and regulated with a hand control. The base Michaux velocipede came with a spoon brake but the steam version had no brakes. The engine weighed , and the total weight of the steam velocipede was . A 14 June 1871 addition to Perreaux's patent included the removal of the cranks and pedals from the front wheel, and using an arched instead of straight downtube to allow space for the engine. Although the steam velocipede was functional, it did not have any commercial successors. Drawing of tricycle version, circa 1884 Only one example of the original 1867-1871 machine was ever made, but by 1884, Perreaux exhibited a tricycle version of his steam velocipede, with two rear wheels and the belt driving the front wheel, at the Industrial Exhibition on the Champs-Élysées, Paris.

Its territory was bounded to the west by Rhoiteion and to the east by Dardanus. It was located about 1.5 km north-east of the village of İntepe (previously known as Erenköy) in Çanakkale Province, Turkey.Cook (1973) 72-7 with Fig. 3. The city was situated on the steep brow of a hill overlooking the Dardanelles, hence the origin of its Ancient Greek name (ophrus), meaning 'brow of a hill', 'crag'.The usage of in Greek is the same as that of 'brow' in English, where it denotes both the physionomic feature and, by virtue of the likeness, the geographical feature: LSJ s.v. A.2.II. Foundation Ophryneion was supposedly one of a series of cities founded by Akamas the son of Theseus which he subsequently passed off as being founded by Ascanius and Skamandrios, the sons of Aeneas and of Hector respectively.Scholia in Euripides, Andromache 10. This story was taken from the 2nd century BC scholar Lysimachus of Alexandria, who related it in Book 2 of his Nostoi, who in turn derived it from a late 4th century BC historian known as Dionysios of Chalkis.Lysimachus of Alexandria, Nostoi, BNJ 382 F 9; see A. Schachter, 'Biography', BNJ (= Brill's New Jacoby) 382. It has been argued that this tradition reflects a pro-Athenian bias, as it makes the founder of many places in the Troad the son of Athens' most important hero, Theseus, while at the same time explaining away the fact that contemporary traditions made no mention of such a connection.B.C. Rose, 'Separating fact from fiction in the Aiolian migration' Hesperia 77 (2008) 419. An example of the opposing tradition is Hellanicus FGrHist 4 F 31 = Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities 1.46.1, 47.2, which associates the people of Ophyneion with Aeneas' escape from Troy. By contrast with the story of Ophryneion being founded by Akamas, which puts the city's origins in the period immediately following the destruction of Troy, surface surveys conducted on the site suggest that it was occupied no earlier than the 6th century BC.Cook (1973) 77. The Tomb of Hector thumb300pxright O: bearded Hector wearing triple crested helmet R: infant Dionysos holdig bunch of grape, OΦPY this bronze coin was struck in Ophryneion 350-300 BC In Antiquity Ophryneion was considered to be the site of the Tomb of Hector, the famous Trojan hero killed by Achilles in Homer's Iliad. It is possible that a lost play of the 5th century BC tragedian Sophocles referred to this tradition, and it likewise appears to be referred to on a vase from c. 500-490 BC depicting the sack of Troy.The reference to the play by Sophocles has been restored in an inscription listing the plays of Sophocles immediately before another which named Hector in its title. The inscription was found in the Piraeus of Athens and dates to the 1st century BC: SEG 37.130.19-20; of course, we do not know the play's actual contents. A label on a vase by Onesimos reads 'Ophrynos': SEG 55.107. A scholion on line 1206 of the early 3rd century BC poem Alexandra by Lycophron explains that Ophrynos is Ophryneion, the place where Hector was buried until his remains were moved to Thebes. Again, we do not know what meaning 'Ophrynos' had for Onesimos, even if it seemed self-evident to the scholiast on Lycophron. However, the first secure reference to this tradition appears on the coinage of Ophryneion, c. 350-300 BC, which depicted Hector.B.V. Head, Historia Numorum2 547, SNG Cop. Troas 455-60. After the city of Thebes was rebuilt in 316 BC (it had been destroyed by Alexander the Great in 335 BC), the bones of Hector were moved from Ophryneion to Thebes in accordance with an oracle which promised Thebes prosperity should this happen.Lycophron (early 3rd century BC), Alexandra 1189-1213, Aristodemos of Thebes (2nd century BC), FGrHist 383 F 7 = scholion on Homer, Iliad 13.1. It has been argued that we should therefore restore 'Ophryneion' instead of 'Antigoneia' in a lacuna of the inscription which lists the cities that contributed to refounding Thebes after 316 BC: IG VII 2419.16 with SEG 31.502. In the early 1st century AD, the geographer Strabo described there being a sacred precinct of Hector near Oryphneion in a conspicuous spot, but scholars have been unable to identify it.Strabo 13.1.29; Cook (1973) 77. In the summer of 399 BC Xenophon sacrificed at Ophryneion, but he does not say to which deity: Xenophon, Anabasis 7.8.5. History Ophryneion is rarely mentioned in extant sources from Antiquity. Herodotus mentions that in 480 BC Xerxes passed by his way up the coast before crossing to Europe at nearby Abydos.Herodotus 7.43.2. Later that century, it was one of the Actaean cities which Mytilene lost control of following the end of the Mytilenean revolt in 427 BC.IG I3 71.III.131 (restored), IG I3 77.IV.20 (restored). The restored tribute assessment of 5 talents is considered suspiciously high: Cook (1973) 77, Carusi (2003) 37. An inscription from Athens dating to 414/413 BC, which records property confiscated from Athenian nobleman implicated in the mutilation of the Herms, indicates that a relative of Alcibiades, Axiochus, earned revenues from land in the territory of Ophryneion.IG I3 430.11. In the summer of 399 BC Xenophon stopped here to offer sacrifice while marching home with the Ten Thousand.Xenophon, Anabasis 7.8.5. Later in the 4th century BC, a speech of the orator Demosthenes relates how a man who had been exiled from Byzantium, Parmeno, had decided to settle at Ophryneion, but was forced to move when an earthquake struck the Chersonese and brought down his house, presumably causing similar damage in the rest of the town.Demosthenes 33.20. For the speech's authenticity (often doubted), see D. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator (2009) 275-9. Some time shortly after 316 BC, the bones of Hector were moved from Ophryneion to Thebes (see above, The Tomb of Hector), although Strabo's description of Hector's precinct at Ophryneion in the 1st century AD suggests that he was still worshipped there after his bones had moved.Strabo 13.1.29. Strabo indicates that before the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC, Ophryneion had been under the sway of Dardanus to the north-east, whereas after this point it instead belonged to Ilium.Strabo 13.1.39, Cook (1973) 77. Pot sherds and coins found at Ophryneion indicate that the site was continuously occupied until at least the Byzantine period, but with the exception of its fame as the one-time location of the bones of Hector, we hear no more about it.Cook (1973) 74-7.

The crater lies in a volcanic field at a base elevation of about , and prominence heights of about . The northwestern end of the crater is covered with lava flows, while the southern end is filled with low cinder cones. Several of the surrounding cones include the better known, taller and younger Sunset Crater in the adjacent Sunset Crater National Monument. The wilderness area that includes Strawberry Crater covers , consisting mainly of hills, cinder cones, and arid terrain ranging in elevation from . The surface landforms are about 50,000 to 100,000 years old.  Name  The cone shape and the reddish cinders that created the cone resemble a giant strawberry.  Geology  Experts say that Strawberry Crater is relatively young compared to other craters in the United States. It was formed from volcanic eruptions around 800 and 1604 B.C. There were several volcanic periods, during which multi-colored rocks were deposited on Earth's surface. Nine-hundred-year-old Sinagua ruins in the vicinity include evidence of gardens that used volcanic cinders as a water-retaining mulch. There are many different paths leading to the crater, but there is only one trail that is marked. Surrounding the crater, there are rolling cinder-strewn hills with a variety of different plants from pinons to junipers. From the top of the cinder cones there are views of the Kachina Peaks Wilderness, the Hopi Buttes, the Painted Desert, and the valley of the Little Colorado River. The geologic forms and twisted junipers make Strawberry Crater Wilderness a popular place for photography.  Climate  Hiking and recreation at Strawberry Crater is open year round. Winters near the crater average to around 50 degrees, while summers tend to be very hot and dry. There are very few natural water sources near the hiking trail, so travelers are advised to bring a sufficient amount of water.  Archaeology  Around the actual crater, there are low walls of stacked rock. These walls are said to be Native American constructions. There are also remnants of ancient gardens where inhabitants used volcanic cinders for water-retaining mulch.  Recreation  Strawberry Crater offers a variety of recreational activities such as day hiking and horseback riding.

September 6, 2006. Arts 9. Retrieved from Google Books (5 of 10) on April 29, 2011. Hamtramck Disneyland was started in 1992 and came to be finished in 1999. It is built on a 30-foot backyard on top of two adjacent garages. Dmytro was born in Ukraine, and also once lived in Germany. After immigrating to the United States, he worked for General Motors, but soon after his retirement he felt the need to find a hobby. Dmytro began piling together different objects—some old, some new, and some bought, while others were hand crafted. This towering structure stands tall above his house and garage. Over the course of 12 years, Dmytro continued to add different pieces to his work, which eventually grew to be a collage.  History  The notion of building his artwork began when Dmytro Szylak, a Ukrainian immigrant, retired from General Motors. After working 32 years, Szylak began to search for a hobby, which led to the creative idea of building Hamtramck Disneyland. To utilize his spare time, and with the idea of bringing something new to the city, Szylak began to convert his own backyard into a piece of art. It is a homemade construction built on top of two adjacent garages; a 30-ft. collage filled with pictures of Elvis and other pop stars, year-round Christmas lights, wooden soldiers armed with toy guns, and American flags, among many other things. In 1992, when Szylak started building his work in his backyard, he endured many difficulties. Neighbors and city officials were against Szylak’s idea of constructing artwork in his garage rooftop. Szylak was later honored by the mayor of Hamtramck and his works have been displayed in many local art shows. In 2006 Bruce Weber shot a photo shoot with Kate Moss for Women’s Wear magazine in the site and around various other places in Detroit.Walter Wasacz. \\"Unofficial Art.\\" Model D Home—Detroit's Online News Magazine. 15 Aug. 2006. Web. 26 Jan. 2011. . Dmytro Syzlak died on 1 May 2015 at the age of 92. As of June 2015, the future of the work was uncertain—his estate was still tied up in probate court. The site went on the market on 3 March 2016 and was bought by a local group, Hatch Art, for $100,000. The houses consist of four apartments—three are rented out to defray costs and the other is for an artist in residence.  Design and theme  The work is a collaboration of various ordinary objects put together to form a towering structure. The creator of this collage, Dmytro Szylak, used these objects to create his own interpretation of Disneyland. It is decorated with various objects ranging from mechanical fan propellers to plastic horses and a massive handmade jet aircraft. The major theme that seems very much evident throughout the collage is that of a carnival. One will notice that Dmytro has a recurring design throughout the entire structure. He used plastic horses for a carousel. The primary colors he chose to use were yellow, blue and red. These three colors were on many of the structures, which would signify his heritage. Dmytro was a native Ukrainian and he used the yellow and blue colors on his project to show his pride for his home country. He also used yellow and red for some of his propellers, seeing as he once resided in Germany before immigrating to America. Dmytro also used many handcrafted cutouts of men in uniform. The wooden cutouts of men were placed under what seemed to be missiles that were intensely decorated with Christmas lights. The men also had one eye painted in the middle of their heads. On the other side of the yard, there stands a windmill which has different cutouts of men and women who appear to be doing manual labor such as cutting a log with a saw and cooking. Toward the back of the structure, which can be seen through the alley, the structure takes a different turn with more vivid colors and paintings placed next to each other. There are also framed newspapers featuring Dmytro's work, as well as a collage of pictures of him with his artwork. The back of the structure covers both garage tops. From the back the fans and propellers are seen next to each other, giving the structure a flying movement. On the back side there sits a sign saying “Welcome to Art Show”. It really is an art exhibition; on the back side of the structure there are many more frames, and wooden objects such as the Statue of Liberty and soldiers. Way above all the rest of the objects are a carousel. On that side you can see the distinct connection between his American, Ukrainian, and German heritage. The collaboration of all these objects was just Dmytro's way of self-expression through a form of art. Dmytro said everything he made with this “Disneyland” was unplanned, and it fell together on its own. He had no set plan and no blueprint of how it should look; he began from the ground up.  Visiting the site  The exhibition is located in an alley between Klinger and Sobieski Streets, south of Carpenter Avenue, in Hamtramck, Michigan.

The album's first single, \\"In a Place of Lesser Men\\", was released via SoundCloud two months prior on March 21, 2011. Subsequently, \\"Non Populus\\" was also released four days later. Five days ahead of the album release, the entire album was available to stream online via ExploreMusic. The album debuted at #5 on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album was nominated for Rock Album of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards. Good has stated that it is his favourite of his own albums. Background Produced by Warne Livesey, Lights marked the sixth album the two had worked together on (including Matthew Good Band discography). While Good's lyrics on Lights remain socio-political and personal in nature, the album marks a departure from Good's rock-driven style with layered arrangements and instrumentation featuring horns, strings, woodwinds and piano – a reflection of Good's musical upbringing and tastes, listening to big bands from Glenn Miller to Count Basie, as well as modern jazz, such as Miles Davis and Mingus. He also singled out the horn section on Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied\\" as a particular influence for the album's fifth track, \\"Zero Orchestra\\". The musical style also marked an effort from Good and Livesey to create something that was not necessarily \\"commercially viable\\", an idea that the two first discussed when they were mixing 1997's Underdogs. Good has recalled writing what would be the eighth track on Lights, \\"Set Me on Fire\\", as having re- energized the concept. Good and Livesey first experimented with a Vancouver- based group of musicians to play the horns on the album, but described the results as \\"horrifying\\". They subsequently contacted Nashville-based Terry Townson, who they ultimately stuck with, on the advice of The Odds' Craig Northey. Townson, in turn, brought in other musicians to complete the recording. Lights also features Good's daughter singing in the background on \\"Shallow's Low\\".

Made up of brothers Martin Welham, Adrian Welham and school friend Dez Allenby, they started out performing unaccompanied traditional folk music in a similar vein to contemporaries The Watersons and The Young Tradition. The band were pioneers of the nascent 1960s underground acoustic-psychedelic/acid-folk scene writing unconventionally crafted songs evoking Britain's ancient groves using a variety of acoustic instruments. History Beginning life under the name The Foresters of Walesby, the group began singing unaccompanied vocal harmony folk songs in Lincolnshire folk clubs. After relocating to Birmingham, West Midlands, in 1968, they shortened their name to Forest and soon progressed to writing within the burgeoning psychedelic/acid folk movement in the wake of the Incredible String Band's emergence in the mid-1960s. They were championed by DJ John Peel and performed several sessions for BBC Radio 1. In 1969, they were signed by Blackhill Enterprises and were amongst the first wave of signings for EMI's new progressive Harvest Records label. The non-album single \\"Searching for Shadows\\" was released in 1969, followed by Forest's debut eponymous album which featured an array of acoustic medieval sounding instruments, contrapunctal harmonies and pastoral lyrical imagery. Full Circle was released a year later, an eclectic set of songs with dark themes that saw more disparate styles incorporated into their brand of pagan folk, including the neo-classical piece 'Graveyard' and the bleakly baroque \\"Midnight Hanging of a Runaway Serf\\". Opening track \\"Hawk The Hawker\\" was given a country hint by the inclusion of steel guitar (played by session musician Gordon Huntley) and the traditional folk piece 'Famine Song' saw the band return to their unaccompanied three-part harmony roots. Both gatefold album covers featured strikingly haunting artwork by artist Joan Melville. Dez Allenby left the band in 1971 and the Welhams drafted in Dave Panton (viola, oboe and saxophone) and Dave Stubbs (bass) for their live work. Forest's final festival appearance was at the 1971 Pinkpop Festival in Geleen, Netherlands, which saw them record their final BBC Radio 1 sessions before disbanding later that year. The Forest song \\"A Glade Somewhere\\" featured on the Harvest Records sampler Picnic - A Breath of Fresh Air in 1970. \\"Graveyard\\" was included on the 2004 Castle Records acid-folk compilation Gather in the Mushrooms and the Albion Records collection Strange Folk released in 2006, included the Forest album track \\"Fading Light\\". Legacy Forest's second album, Full Circle, was one of The Guardian's 1000 albums to hear before you die. Martin Welham is now one half of psych-folk duo, The Story, with his son Tom. Dez Allenby is active playing music in East Yorkshire and beyond.
