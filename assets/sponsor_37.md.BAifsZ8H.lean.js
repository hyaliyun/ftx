Dominic DeTomas, formerly head of the secret police of Kingdom, is now dictator and has put together a new fascist government that strongly resembles that of Nazi Germany. DeTomas's policies engendered resentment among certain parts of the populace, and this festers into an uprising. While the mild-mannered inhabitants of Kingdom might not expect to succeed against an implacably violent police state, the uprising is advised and led by an amnesiac Confederation Marine who had been captured by the alien Skinks and later released when the Skinks were driven off Kingdom.

It relates ancient observation of corvid behaviour that recent scientific studies have confirmed is goal-directed and indicative of causal knowledge rather than simply being due to instrumental conditioning. The fable and its moral The fable is made the subject of a poem by the first century CE Greek Poet Bianor,The Greek Anthology, trans. W.R.Paton, New York 1916, poem 272, p.145 was included in the 2nd century fable collection of pseudo-Dositheus and later appears in the 4th-5th-century Latin verse collection by Avianus.Avianus 27 (Latin, English). Retrieved on 2007-07-19. The history of this fable in antiquity and the Middle Ages is tracked in A.E. Wright's Hie lert uns der meister: Latin Commentary and the Germany Fable. The story concerns a thirsty crow that comes upon a pitcher with water at the bottom, beyond the reach of its beak. After failing to push it over, the bird drops in pebbles one by one until the water rises to the top of the pitcher, allowing it to drink. In his telling, Avianus follows it with a moral that emphasises the virtue of ingenuity: \\"This fable shows us that thoughtfulness is superior to brute strength.\\" Other tellers of the story stress the crow's persistence. In Francis Barlow's edition the proverb 'Necessity is the mother of invention' is applied to the storyhttp://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/barlow/39.htm while an early 20th-century retelling quotes the proverb 'Where there's a will, there's a way'.J.H.Stickney, Aesop‚Äôs Fables: a version for young readers, Boston 1915, text available online Artistic use of the fable may go back to Roman times, since one of the mosaics that has survived is thought to have the story of the crow and the pitcher as its subject. Modern equivalents have included English tiles from the 18th and 19th centuries and an American mural by Justin C. Gruelle (1889‚Äì1978), created for a Connecticut school.There is a photograph of this taken in 1936 in the collection of Connecticut State Library These and the illustrations in books of fables had little scope for invention. The greatest diversity is in the type of vessel involved and over the centuries these have varied from a humble clay pot to elaborate Greek pitchers. There has also been a musical interpretation among the ten on David P. Shortland's Australian recording, Aesop Go HipHop (2012), where the sung chorus after the hip hop narration underlines what can be achieved by incremental effort, \\"Little by little, bit by bit\\".\\"Little by Little\\", a performance on YouTube The fable in science The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder is the earliest to attest that the story reflects the behaviour of real-life corvids. In August 2009, a study published in Current Biology revealed that rooks, a relative of crows, do just the same as the crow in the fable when presented with a similar situation. The ethologist Nicola Clayton, also taking the fable as a starting point, found that other corvids are capable of the thinking demonstrated there. Eurasian jays were able to drop stones into a pitcher of water to make the water level rise. Further research established that the birds understood that the pitcher must contain liquid rather than a solid for the trick to work, and that the objects dropped in must sink rather than float. New Caledonian crows perform similarly, but Western scrub-jays appear to fail. The findings have advanced knowledge of bird intelligence; the Eurasian jay had not been scientifically observed to use tools either in the wild or in captivity before. The research also indicated that physical cognition evolved earlier in the corvid family than previously thought as the not closely related crows and ravens were already known to score highly on intelligence tests, with certain species topping the avian IQ scale and tool use is well-documented. Unrelated birds, the great-tailed grackles, also pass the test due to remarkable behavioral flexibility. Such tool use has been observed in great apes as well and the researchers were quoted as drawing a parallel between their findings and the fable.

Today, the states of New York and New Jersey have the largest populations of Italian-Americans in the United States, while Rhode Island and Connecticut have the highest overall percentages in relation to their respective populations. In sharp contrast, most of the rest of the country (exceptions being South Florida and New Orleans) have very few Italian-American residents. During the labor shortage in the 19th and early 20th centuries, planters in the Deep South did attract some Italian immigrants to work as sharecroppers, but they soon left due to extreme anti-Italian discrimination and strict regimen of the plantations. According to a recent United Census Bureau estimate, 17.8 million Americans are of Italian descent. Communities of Italian Americans were established in many major industrial cities of the early 20th century, such as Baltimore (particularly Little Italy, Baltimore), Boston (particularly in the North End), Philadelphia proper (particularly South Philadelphia) and the Philadelphia metro area (particularly neighborhoods in Delco, Atlantic City, Little Italy, Wilmington; and Vineland), Pittsburgh (particularly Bloomfield), Northeastern Pennsylvania cities, Lehigh Valley cities, Detroit, Providence (particularly Federal Hill), St. Louis (particularly The Hill), Chicago, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Youngstown, Erie, Cleveland, Buffalo, Newark, and New York City, which boasts the largest Italian-American population, which live in several concentrated communities in the New York metropolitan area, including the five boroughs, Long Island, and Westchester.

It is set in 1985 United States, The check which Frank hands Isold at the end of the film is dated \\"Nov. 13, 1985\\". but almost entirely shot in Iceland. Icelandic musician Mugison composed and performed the soundtrack, except for the song \\"A Little Trip to Heaven\\", which is originally by Tom Waits. Mugison performs the Waits song on the soundtrack. Plot Before the opening credits, a recent widow is sitting in a life insurance office. Expecting to be compensated for her husband's death, the widow is informed that she is not entitled to full death benefits because the insurance company has obtained video of her husband smoking and attributes his death to cigarettes. Abe Holt looks on as his co-worker convinces the widow that she's lucky to leave with a small fraction of the award she was expecting. The film centers around three vehicle crashes, revealed in sequence at the beginning of the movie. The first depicts a young couple flying through the open roof of their convertible, which has been sailed over a cliff. They swim to shore, where the woman hits the leg of her fellow passenger with a pipe. The second involves a city bus and insurance adjustor Abe Holt (Forest Whitaker), who has arrived at the scene suspicious that many of the passengers boarded the bus after the accident, looking to file a claim. Holt bluffs, claiming a hidden camera will help sort out who was actually on the bus. Many leave, and his co-worker (Peter Coyote) quickly tells him their company wants him to investigate a crash in the remote and desolate town of North Hastings, Minnesota. The third crash involves an unnamed young man who is stranded at the side of the road on a rainy night, after stopping in the local bar. He accepts a ride from the driver who had previously drained his gas tank, and who then proceeds to accelerate the car into the wall of a tunnel, injuring his passenger in the wreck. The anonymous man is dragged to the front seat and buckled in before the siphoned gas is poured over the car and set ablaze. However, to those who later discover the crash it appears that the actual driver Kelvin Anderson has died after crashing his own car into the tunnel wall, igniting a fire that burned his body beyond recognition. The local police are convinced it is an open-and-shut case because Kelvin's driver's license was found in the glovebox, the plates on the car match Kelvin's, and Kelvin's sister, Isold (Julia Stiles), lives on the far side of the tunnel. However, Holt is suspicious because while the body is conveniently unidentifiable, the license is undamaged and Isold, the sole beneficiary of the $1 million policy, is skittish and was not expecting her brother's visit. Isold's husband \\"Fred\\" McBride (Jeremy Renner), is unexpectedly cheerful and vaguely threatening, convincing Holt there's more to this case. As he investigates the case Holt uncovers leading clues: Frederick McBride is actually dead and buried in a field outside the abandoned McBride home, and the supposedly dead Kelvin has a record as a con man. The most convincing evidence is photos of Kelvin from his criminal record and high school, showing him looking like \\"Fred.\\" Holt eventually confirms that the charred body pulled from the car wreck is not Kelvin's, that Isold's \\"husband\\" is actually her brother Kelvin. A flashback reveals that the couple from the convertible seen at the opening of the movie was Isold and Kelvin, wrecking their car‚Äîand Kelvin's leg‚Äîfor insurance money. When Isold figures out that her brother has murdered an innocent drifter she is horrified, but Kelvin convinces her to participate in this final con and hold hostage his son Thor, whom Isold has been helping to raise since the boy's mother left. When Isold visits the insurance office to collect on Kelvin's policy, Holt‚Äîin an echo of the movie's opening scene‚Äîinforms her that he cannot award her the full $1 million she expects, only the blue book value of his car ($1500). She leaves angrily. When Holt tells Isold she's lucky he hasn't exposed her as an accessory to murder, she tells him that her brother has taken Thor. Moved and concerned, Holt puts a one-day hold on her check (ensuring that she'll return to the bank the next day) and changes the name of the insured on the policy from \\"Kelvin Anderson\\" to \\"Frederick McBride.\\" The next day Isold cashes her check and opens a safety deposit box, in which she puts a childhood picture of her and her brother. She returns to the motel where Kelvin is staying with Thor, and tries to convince him that she has left the rest of the money in the safety deposit box, so that she can leave with Thor. Kelvin doesn't buy it, and gets in his car with Thor‚Äîonly to find he's held at gunpoint by Holt, in the backseat. Holt tells Isold to leave with the boy and \\"Fred\\" speeds off, buckling his seatbelt (a sign he intends to crash the car). Kelvin crashes the car, killing both men, and Isold is awarded the full benefits of the tampered life insurance policy. The film ends with Abe walking on a beach meant to suggest heaven, that is identical to the beach featured in the insurance company's commercial shown earlier in the film, as the credits roll.

It is named for Harold Roe Bartle, a prominent, two-term mayor of Kansas City in the 1950s and early-1960s. Bartle Hall's four tall art deco inspired pylons are a striking fixture in the Kansas City skyline. Background Kansas City Convention Center is Kansas City's largest complex of multifaceted structures dedicated to meetings and conventions, sports and entertainment. It offers of column-free exhibit space on one floor, of tenant finishes, a conference center, another of additional space on two levels, 45 meeting rooms, a 2,400-seat fine arts theater, and an arena that can seat over 10,700 people, along with a ballroom that was scheduled for an April 2007 opening, all connected to major downtown hotels and underground parking by glass-enclosed skywalks and below-ground walkways. A unique Convention Center feature is the expansive Barney Allis Plaza, a public square ideal for outdoor receptions, festivals and concerts. The interior finishes in the public access areas consist of granite flooring and stairs adjacent to Precast Concrete panels at the Main Entry with Carpet Tile in the Ballroom and Pre-functions. The Ballroom and Pre-function areas feature Metal Panels, wood panels, wood veneer and painted gyp wall surfaces as well as Fabric Wall Panels and Sculptured Glass Fiber Reinforced Gypsum (GFRG) Panels on the interior walls. The Sculptured GFRG Panels create a simulated wave pattern which ties into the water theme of the facility drawing from Kansas City‚Äôs origin at the nexus of the Kansas and Missouri rivers. The Grand Ballroom ceilings are finished out in Metal Panel‚Äôs bordered at the perimeter walls with Stretched Fabric. The Stretch Fabric ceilings are backlit by a sophisticated LED lighting system that can be programmed to rain the GRGF wall panels in color. The ceiling space also features concentric light fixtures ranging in size for to in diameter. The nonpublic service areas for the project features over of Pantry/Kitchen space with of walk-in cooler and freezer space. Additionally there are 2 separate Beverage/Ice Service Rooms for catering personnel to service Ballroom functions. These service areas are sealed concrete and resinous flooring in the Kitchen areas with FRP and MDF veneer wall panels. The service area is accessed by 2 separate covered loading docks that can be accessed from the highway. The exterior of the facility is highlighted by a high metal panel canopy over pavestone walkway at the main entry. This canopy also extends the full length of the East Elevation and is supported by Steel Columns and Fixed Blade Steel Sunshades. The Southern Elevation of the building again features a high canopy with Fixed Blade Sunshades and opens onto a Decorative Concrete Plaza designed by Jun Kaneko, a renowned Japanese ceramic artist. This Plaza is complemented by Architectural Precast Concrete retaining walls, concrete stairs and walkways along with decorative concrete monument light pole bases. The remainder of the site is Greenscape consisting of Sodded open area with some 50,000 Kewensis, Sedum and Vinca Minor plants along with thirty-four caliper Japanese Pagota and Honey Locust trees.  Construction  The expansion of Bartle Hall was a significant technical challenge. Construction of the additional convention space was built over a continuously open six-lane freeway, Interstate 670, which runs underneath the convention center. Construction required the installation of four tall pylons to support the facility's roof. The result was the creation of the largest, column-free convention environment in the world. The building also was designed and constructed to meet green building standards and achieved a LEED Silver rating, the first City of Kansas City, Missouri project to receive Silver LEED certification. The general contractor for the project was Walton Construction. The site team included 2 LEED Accredited Professionals documenting and tracking materials, construction methods, recycling and waste management. Architects were HNTB Architects, BNIM; engineers were Henderson Engineers; and multimedia, acoustics, and IT were by Shen Milsom & Wilke. The total project cost was US$91.7 million, and it was completed on schedule in July 1994. Pylons and \\"Sky Stations\\" Bartle Hall crosses above Interstate highway I-670 suspended by steel cables supported by four tall concrete pylons. These pylons are crowned by sculptures designed by artist R.M. Fisher, called \\"Sky Stations\\". The different, aluminum, installation pieces are between and tall. The pylons and sculptures are dramatically lighted at night. Gallery Image:Kansas City Night 08MAR07 097.jpgBartle Hall stretches across Interstate 670 in Kansas City.

Career Ehart contacted Kerry Livgren about joining a band named White Clover after hearing that Livgren's band Kansas (the second band of that name) had recently disbanded. With White Clover he performed at the New Orleans Pop Festival in 1969, which had a huge impact on him. White Clover in time renamed itself \\"Kansas.\\" This third Kansas is the band that became the well-known American progressive rock band. In the early 1970s Ehart, like many American musicians, wanted to more closely study and play the \\"British\\" style of music that was popular at the time, so he moved to England. He did not find the atmosphere welcoming, as the musicians there were happier to learn the country and rhythm and blues styles that Ehart brought with him, so he quickly returned to America.

He was a teacher, engineer, prisoner of war, royal tutor, and priest, who founded many Carmelite monasteries around Poland after their suppression by the Russians. Kalinowski was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1991, the first man to be so recognized in the Order of Discalced Carmelites since John of the Cross. Childhood Birth record (parish of St. John in Vilna, 226/1835) He was born J√≥zef Kalinowski to a noble \\"szlachta\\" family in the city of Vilnius (Vilna). At the time he was born, the area was known as a Russian partition, though it had formerly been part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the second son of Andrew Kalinowski (1805‚Äì1878), an assistant superintendent professor of mathematics at the local Institute for Nobles (Instytut Szlachecki). His mother, Josephine Po≈Ço≈Ñska, also a noblewoman, Leliwa coat of arms died a few months after he was born, leaving him and his older brother Victor without a mother. His father then married Josephine's sister (a practice that was not uncommon in that time), Sophie Po≈Ço≈Ñska, and had three more children: Charles, Emily, and Gabriel. After Sophie died in 1845, Andrew married again, this time to the 17-year-old Sophie Puttkamer, daughter of Maryla Wereszczak (famous at the time for being written about by Adam Mickiewicz), who became mother to all of Andrew's existing children and had four more of her own: Mary, Alexander, Monica, and George. From the age of 8, Kalinowski attended the Institute for Nobles at Vilna, and graduated with honors in 1850.Sokol, p. 173 He next attended the School of Agriculture (Instytut Agronomiczny) at Hory-Horki, near Orsha. Military career The Russians strictly limited opportunities for further education, so in 1853 he enlisted in the Imperial Russian Army and entered the Nicholayev Engineering Academy (Miko≈Çajewska Szko≈Ça In≈ºynierii). The Army promoted him to Second Lieutenant in 1856. In 1857 he worked as an associate professor of mathematics, and from 1858-1860, he worked as an engineer who helped design the Odessa-Kiev-Kursk railway. In 1862 the Imperial Russian Army promoted him to Captain and stationed him in Brest, Belarus, but he still sympathized with the Poles. He consequently resigned from the Imperial Russian Army in 1863 to serve as minister of war for the January Uprising, a Polish insurrection, in the Vilnius region. He determined never to sentence anyone to death nor to execute any prisoner. When the Poles rose against the Russians in 1863, Raphael joined them and was soon taken prisoner. Very few survived the forced march to slave labour in Siberia, but Raphael was sustained by his faith and became a spiritual leader to the prisoners. He was released ten years later.The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of Saints, Tessa Paul, Reverend Ronald Creighton-Jobe, Anness Publishing, p.228 Siberia On 24 March 1864, Russian authorities arrested Kalinowski and in June condemned him to death by firing squad. His family intervened, and the Russians, fearing that their Polish subjects would revere him as a political martyr, commuted the sentence to 10 years in katorga, the Siberian labor camp system. They forced him to trek overland to the salt mines of Usolye- Sibirskoye near Irkutsk, Siberia, a journey that took nine months. Three years after arriving in Usolye, Kalinowski moved to Irkutsk. In 1871/1872 he did meteorological research for the Siberian subdivision of the Russian Geographical Society. He also participated in research expedition of Benedykt Dybowski to Kultuk, on the shore of Lake Baikal. Authorities released him from Siberia in 1873 but exiled him from Lithuania; he then moved to Paris, France. Royal tutor Kalinowski returned to Warsaw in 1874, where he became a tutor to 16-year-old Prince August Czartoryski. The prince was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1876, and Kalinowski accompanied him to various health destinations in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Poland. Kalinowski was a major influence on the young man (known as \\"Gucio\\"), who later became a priest and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2004. Later Kalinowski decided to travel to the city of Brest where he began a Sunday school at the fortress in Brest- Litovsk where he was a captain, he became increasingly aware of the state persecution of the church, and of his native Poles. Carmelite friar and priest In 1877 Kalinowski was admitted to the Carmelite priory in Linz, and where he was given the religious name of Brother Raphael of St. Joseph, O.C.D. The name \\"of St. Joseph\\" had nothing to do with his birthname‚Äîit was common for many Carmelites to list their name as \\"of St. Joseph\\", after the \\"Convent of St. Joseph\\" founded by Teresa of Avila, co-founder of the Discalced Carmelite Order. Kalinowski was ordained as a priest at Czerna in 1882 by Bishop Albin Dunajewski, and in 1883 he became prior of the monastery at Czerna. Kalinowski founded multiple Catholic organizations around Poland and Ukraine, most prominent of which was a monastery in Wadowice, Poland, where he was also prior. He founded a monasteries of Discalced Carmelite nuns in Przemy≈õl in 1884, and Lvov in 1888. From 1892-1907 Kalinowski worked to document the life and work of Mother Theresa Marchocka, a 17th-century Discalced Carmelite nun, to assist with her beatification. Kalinowski died in Wadowice of tuberculosis in 1907.Sokol, p. 174 Fourteen years later, Karol Wojty≈Ça, later known as Pope John Paul II, was born in the same town. Kalinowski was a noted spiritual director of both Catholic and Russian Orthodox faithful.Carmelite.com > Our saints > St. Raphael Kalinowski at www.carmelite.com Veneration Czerna, Poland Kalinowski's remains were originally kept in the monastery cemetery, but this caused difficulties because of the large number of pilgrims who came visiting. So many of them took handfuls of dirt from the grave that the nuns had to keep replacing the earth and plants at the cemetery. His body was later moved to a tomb, but the pilgrims went there instead, often scratching with their hands at the plaster, just to have some relic to keep with them.Elonka's Family: Pics and Info about Saint Raphael Kalinowski His remains were then moved to a chapel in Czerna, where they remain.Witryna Krakowskiej Prowincji Karmelit√≥w Bosych at www.karmel.pl Pope John Paul II beatified Kalinowski in 1983 in Krak√≥w, in front of a crowd of over two million people.

He was a right-handed batsman and a slow left arm bowler, who primarily played for Kent County Cricket Club. As of 2018 he is the Second XI coach at Kent. Born in Bombay (now called Mumbai), and educated in England at Dartford Grammar School and later Manchester Polytechnic, Patel's first-class cricket debut for Kent came at the end of the 1989 English cricket season, in a match against Middlesex. He became a regular in the Kent side over the following seasons, and in 1994 and 1995 \\"took wickets for fun\\"; indeed in 1994 he was the leading wicket-taker in England with 90 at a bowling average of 22.86. Pitches at Kent's home ground, the St Lawrence Ground, began to be prepared specifically for the spin bowling of Patel and Carl Hooper, despite the home side also boasting a seam attack of Alan Igglesden, Martin McCague, Dean Headley and Duncan Spencer. 1996 saw Patel make his Test debut against the country of his birth, India. One of seven players to make their debut in the match at Edgbaston, Patel struggled to make an impact on a green wicket, only bowling ten overs in England's eight wicket win. Left out for the second Test at Lord's, he returned for the third Test at Trent Bridge. Again, Patel struggled on a pitch not suited to spin bowling, however he managed to take his maiden (and last) Test wicket; that of Sanjay Manjrekar, caught by Graeme Hick. Patel's career looked to be in jeopardy during 1997, when a combination of injuries sustained while teaching PE and whilst batting for his club side ruled him out for most of the season. He returned the following season, and performed consistently for them through the following eight seasons. Patel joined Central Districts for one season over the winter of 2005/2006, where he proved a useful asset in the side's State Championship victory, taking six wickets in the final. This came after he had been mentioned in relation to a possible recall to the England squad as cover for Ashley Giles on the tour of Pakistan. Following a recurring elbow injury, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the start of the 2008 season.

Signs and symptoms The disorder is characterized by the following: * Hypogonadism * Brachydactyly syndrome * Choroid plexus calcification * Hypoplasia of dental enamel * Full cheeks * Hypocalcemic tetany Choroid plexus(bottom left) Individuals with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy exhibit short stature, characteristically shortened fourth and fifth metacarpals, rounded facies, and often mild intellectual deficiency. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is commonly known as pseudohypoparathyroidism because the kidney responds as if parathyroid hormone were absent. Blood levels of parathyroid hormone are elevated in pseudohypoparathyroidism due to the hypocalcemia Genetics This condition is associated with genetic imprinting. It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and seems to be associated with a Gs alpha subunit deficiency. Mechanism The mechanism of this condition is due to Gs signaling decrease in hormones having to do with signal transduction which is when a signal from outside cell causes change within the cell (in function). Renal tubule cells only express maternal alleles (variant form of a gene). Diagnosis Complete blood count The diagnosis of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy is based on the following exams below: * CBC * Urine test * MRI Treatment Treatment consists of maintaining normal levels of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D.

History He was born in 1381 in a minor fortified town in the then province of Bitch≈´ (now Okayama) to a samurai of middling rank named Komatsu Ysukiyo. About ten years after his birth, Sh≈çtetsu's family moved to Kyoto for unknown reasons. At approximately the age of 15 (by the Occidental count), he was sent to the religious center of Nara where he became an acolyte in an unspecified Buddhist temple. He would spend the next five years there studying, among other things, Buddhist scripture. Shortly after his father's death in 1400 CE, Sh≈çtetsu moved back to Kyoto, and sought out a fellow named Imagawa Ry≈çshun (b. 1325/1326 ?, d. 1417/1420) and asked him to instruct him in the \\"Way of Poetry\\". This was not an unexpected visit for Ry≈çshun; he and Sh≈çtetsu had met many times previously. It was this Imagawa Ry≈çshun, retired military leader, lay priest, respected amateur poet, and accomplished author of polemic essays attacking the enemies of the Reizei poetic clan, who was apparently instrumental (the relevant passage gives an incorrect age for Ry≈çshun at the period it supposedly occurred, leading Inada Toshinori to believe that the passage conflates a number of events; thus it may be misleading as to the circumstances that introduced Sh≈çtetsu to courtly poetry), in introducing the young Sh≈çtetsu (whose personal name then still was Sonmy≈çmaru, given name Masakiyo) to poetic composition. From an autobiographic portion of Sh≈çtetsu's extended essay on poetry, Sh≈çtetsu Monogatari: (Translation of Sh≈çtetsu Monogatari.) > A certain preceptor of the Ontoku'in once said to me, \\"If you want to > compose poetry, I will take you with me to the civil administrator's house > across the way.\\" At that period of my life, I was still wearing my hair long > in the manner of young children, and I felt embarrassed by my extreme youth, > but nonetheless I went with the preceptor to the civil administrator's > house. ... Then, when I arrived at the poetry meeting itself on the 25th, > the highest places on the one side were occupied by Reizei no Tamemasa and > Tamekuni, and on the other side by the former shogunal deputy ... [who] was > at that time a lay priest of more than 80 years ... After this occasion, I > just kept going again and again to those meetings, and thus gained > experience in poetic composition. I was fourteen years old at the time. Sh≈çtetsu studied classical courtly poetry with Ry≈çshun, and other areas of literature, including of course famous works like The Tales of Ise, Essays in Idleness, and was even inducted into the secret traditions relating to the famed Tale of Genji and theShin Kokin Wakash≈´. With such an influential master, Sh≈çtetsu met and learned from many of the most influential poets of the age. In 1406, Sh≈çtetsu left his master, entering a Kyoto Rinzai Zen temple called T≈çfuku-ji; no doubt he was admitted in no little part because of his relationship to Ry≈çshun (now in his nineties), who had previously gone to that temple. It was during this period that the Reizei family and its poetic ideals (along with associated poets) flourished and received high titles and numerous grants of land. As he was solidly in this school of poetry, Sh≈çtetsu prospered as well. Eventually, cut loose by his two mentors' deaths (Tamemasa would die in 1417, and Ry≈çshun in either 1417, or 1420), Sh≈çtetsu embarked on a short journey - one of the very few journeys far away from Kyoto in his life ‚Äì to visit various \\"utamakura\\" (places famously commemorated in poetry); upon his return to Kyoto, he plunged whole-heartedly into Kyoto's poetry scene, having decided to make his life's work poetry, and not Buddhism. By 1424, he had left his temple for a modest hut on the outskirts of Kyoto, as befitted a professional poet with the accompanying hosts of disciples, patrons, and invitations to head poetry gatherings at the most noble families' homes (and eventually at the residences of the Ashikaga sh≈çguns themselves). But this happy era for Sh≈çtetsu could not last forever. It ended between the second and third day of the fourth month of the year 1432: > On the night of the second, I stayed over at the house of the Chief of > Central Affairs, and awakened to a report that my hut, \\"Imakumano\\", had > burned in a fire in the neighborhood in the middle of the night ‚Äì a report > that was to no avail, for the damage was already done, with all of the poems > I had composed since my twentieth year, all 27,000 of them, in more than 30 > volumes, gone up in smoke, not a single one escaping ‚Äì and this along with > all my books and hand-copied treasures. This was not an isolated setback for the 51-year-old Sh≈çtetsu. The sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimochi had died in 1428, and his younger brother Ashikaga Yoshinori (b. 1394, d. 1441) had succeeded him. Unlike his deceased brother, Yoshinori, with regard to the poetic dispute between the Reizei and the Asukai, distinctly preferred the Asukai's poetry; in addition, several traditional biographies of Sh≈çtetsu claim that Yoshinori had a personal antipathy toward him, going so far as to place Sh≈çtetsu under house arrest. Sh≈çtetsu would suffer two major blows from this official hostility. First, the income from his hereditary estates was confiscated. This was a major financial blow to him, but by no means fatal. The second blow struck straight at his heart; he was denied inclusion in the 21st, and last ever, Imperial anthology of waka which was compiled and edited by the Asukai. This exclusion from the Shinshokukokin Wakash≈´ (\\"New Collection of Ancient and Modern Times Continued\\") meant that Sh≈çtetsu could never achieve the final pinnacle of recognition for poetic merit, and that his name would be permanently diminished for all time; it is difficult to overstate how important inclusion in an Imperial anthology was to medieval poets. In the wake of this blow, Sh≈çtetsu became a hermit, seeing few people, going to fewer gatherings, and composing even fewer poems. His retreat ended in 1441 with the assassination of Yoshinori by one of his generals; Yoshinori's partisan spirit had extended beyond the field of poetry, and irritated many. Sh≈çtetsu returned to his former place, now a highly respected and experienced poet in the liberal Rezei tradition. These were good and prosperous times for him, as he had entry into the most exclusive homes, and indeed, would even tutor the new sh≈çgun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa (b. 1435, d. 1490), in the intricacies of the Tale of Genji; his reward for this lengthy tutoring would be the return of his familial estate. From this period on, Sh≈çtetsu's health declined. The shadow of the approaching ≈ånin War was even then visible in the riots and disturbances which began occurring a number of years before. Sh≈çtetsu had by this point also outlived many of his patrons, students, teachers and friends. After three years of prolonged illness, Sh≈çtetsu died at the age of 79 in the year 1459. He had begun copying out the Tale of Genji, expecting to complete it before he died. He finished the first chapter. In his later years, his greatest student was Shinkei (1406-1475), who, while he greatly admired his former teacher and Teika, worked not just in waka, but in renga as well, where he was known for his usage of the yugen and y≈çembi (ethereal beauty) styles. =Historical context= A defining feature of the poetry of Japan at this period was the existence of a long running feud or war between a number of clans over primacy in poetry, and consequently in courtly influence. Each clan came to be associated with a distinct artistic school. The Rezei family, which Sh≈çtetsu was aligned with, distinctly hewed to a liberal bent and encouraged its poets to experiment with all ten of the traditional recognized styles of poetry, whereas the rival Nij≈ç family advocated a restrained, conservative style (specifically, the \\"ushin\\", or deep feelings style). Both of these families were descended from Fujiwara no Teika, and both claimed to carry on his legacy. After a period of Reizei ascendancy under Rezei Tamehide (great- grandson of Teika) (b. 1302 ?, d. 1372), the Reizei suffered a decline and witnessed the rise in the fortunes of the Nij≈ç, as Tamehide's son, Iametuni, became a monk. The Nij≈ç soon suffered setbacks under the wastrel Nij≈ç Tameshige (b. 1325, d. 1385), whose promising son, Nij≈ç Tamet≈ç (b. 1341, d. 1381), was killed at a comparatively young age by a brigand. In a further disaster for the Nij≈ç, Tamet≈ç's son, Nij≈ç Tamemigi, was killed by a brigand as well in 1399 (?), effectively wiping out the Nij≈ç as a force. Under the grandson of Tamehide, Tanemasa (b. 1361, d. 1417), the Reizei were raised again to their former position of dominance, and this is when Sh≈çtetsu came into the picture. He did this with the aid of a former general, Imagawa Ry≈çshun (b. 1326, d. 1417 or 1420), who had considerable literary skill. They defeated the Nij≈ç adherents close to the Ashikaga shogunate with six polemical treatises between 1403 and 1412, defending the Reizei's poetic doctrine and their cause. Ry≈çshun used a number of quotations to bolster his case, including notably a quote of Teika, which was that all of the \\"ten styles\\" were licit for poetic use and experimentation, and not merely the Nij≈ç's ushin. With the aid Ry≈çshun afforded him, Tanemasa's politicking eventually succeeded in converting the sh≈çgun, ending the matter ‚Äì until the Asukai revived the dispute, that is. His poetry Sh≈çtetsu was a prolific poet. Steven D. Carter once remarked that \\"His complete oeuvre, if it existed today, would probably comprise over 31,000 poems.\\" He emulated his idol Fujiwara no Teika in striving to master all accepted style of poetry. His corpus is extremely difficult to critically examine due to the issues of incompleteness, a wide range of voices and style, and sheer size. =Examples= An example of one of his y≈´gen (\\"mystery and depth\\") poems (translation and format, Steven D. Carter), with the assigned topic preceding Sh≈çtetsu's response: Sh≈çtetsu was also adept at courtly love poems: An allusive variation on a poem by Teika: An allusive variation on an anonymous Kokin Wakash≈´ poem: A number of his poems allude to his understanding of Zen Buddhism: As befitted a professional poet, a number of poems reflect on his chosen occupation: But of course, most poems are not so easily categorized: Critical to understanding his poetry is appreciation of his connection with Teika. =Teika= Monogatari Most modern understanding of Sh≈çtetsu is derived from his Monogatari, which is by either Sh≈çtetsu himself, or edited by his disciple Sh≈çk≈ç. The work is useful, not merely for the critical discussion, but also for the biographical detail on Sh≈çtetsu that it provides. It exists in 2 volumes, probably compiled by disciples. It contains 'randomly a variety of information: bits of Shotetsu's poetic biography, an articulation of his aesthetic ideals,Particularly y≈´gen exegeses of poems, poetic anecdotes, advice for novice poets, and such specialist information as the date of Hitomaro's death.'. \\"Conversations with Shotetsu.\\" Review by Roselee Bundy; Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 47, #3, Autumn 1992 pages 389-391; the review covers Robert Brower's English translation of Shotetsu Monogatari It also provides striking objective proof of Sh≈çtetsu's veneration for Fujiwara. The only poet whose poems are discussed more than Teika is Sh≈çtetsu himself. For all that Sh≈çtetsu was seen by others as a staunch Rezei apologist, and for all that Sh≈çtetsu benefited from his affiliation with the Reizei, he was a bit of a poetic fundamentalist: > Each of these schools has succeeded in mastering only a single poetic style > and is constantly disputing with its rivals. It is my opinion that a person > should pay no attention whatsoever to these schools. Instead, he ought to > cherish the style and spirit of Teika, and strive to emulate him though he > may never succeed. > Now, a person might object to this kind of expression, saying that he would > write instead, \\"Can it be that he has prayed / never to see me again?\\" and > protesting that there is no point in putting it into such difficult > language. This may be very true, of course, but let such critics look at the > collected poems of Teika. There is not a single flat verse to be found among > them.

Proof Expanding the last term, : sum_{1le i < j le n} (a_i b_j - a_j b_i ) (c_i d_j - c_j d_i ) : = sum_{1le i < j le n} (a_i c_i b_j d_j + a_j c_j b_i d_i) +sum_{i=1}^n a_i c_i b_i d_i - sum_{1le i < j le n} (a_i d_i b_j c_j + a_j d_j b_i c_i) - sum_{i=1}^n a_i d_i b_i c_i where the second and fourth terms are the same and artificially added to complete the sums as follows: : = sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^n a_i c_i b_j d_j - sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=1}^n a_i d_i b_j c_j. This completes the proof after factoring out the terms indexed by i. Generalization A general form, also known as the Cauchy‚ÄìBinet formula, states the following: Suppose A is an m√ón matrix and B is an n√óm matrix. If S is a subset of {1, ..., n} with m elements, we write AS for the m√óm matrix whose columns are those columns of A that have indices from S. Similarly, we write BS for the m√óm matrix whose rows are those rows of B that have indices from S. Then the determinant of the matrix product of A and B satisfies the identity :det(AB) = sum_{scriptstyle Ssubset{1,ldots,n}atopscriptstyleS=m} det(A_S)det(B_S), where the sum extends over all possible subsets S of {1, ..., n} with m elements. We get the original identity as special case by setting : A=begin{pmatrix}a_1&dots&a;_nb_1&dots& b_nend{pmatrix},quad B=begin{pmatrix}c_1&d;_1vdots&vdotsc_n&d;_nend{pmatrix}.

Overview  World map of countries, using the OpenDocument standard The OpenDocument format (ODF) was accepted as a standard by OASIS in May 2005, and by ISO in November 2006, as standard ISO/IEC 26300:2006. Microsoft submitted another format, Office Open XML (aka OOXML), to Ecma International where it was accepted as a standard in December 2006. The Office Open XML specification was published as standard ISO/IEC 29500:2008 in November 2008. OpenDocument has been officially approved by national standards bodies of Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, Ecuador, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Sweden.ODF Alliance Newsletter NATO with its 28 members (Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the USA) uses ODF as a mandatory standard for all members.  Africa  = South Africa = On October 23, 2007, the Department of Public Service and Administration of the South African government released a report on interoperability standards in government information systems. It specifies ODF as the standard for \\"working office document formats\\" (with UTF-8/ASCII text and comma-separated values data as the only alternatives). Since April 2008, ODF is a national standard too, not only the standard to be used by government departments. South African code for the ODF standard is \\"SANS 26300:2008/ISO/IEC 26300:2006\\".https://www.sabs.co.za/Business_Units/Standards_SA/WebStore/search/detail.aspx?id=18646‚ü®=EN By September 2008 all departments will be able to read and write in the Open Document Format. In 2009, ODF will become the default document format for South African government departments.  Asia  = Hong Kong = The Hong Kong government releases an Interoperability Framework every year recommending file formats for various tasks. In their latest version they recommend the use of Microsoft Office '97 or OpenOffice.org v2.0 (based on OpenDocument 1.0) file formats for collaborative editing of text documents, spreadsheets and slideshow presentations. = India = Chandershekhar, India's secretary of Ministry of Information and Technology, said, \\"We are glad to note that with formation of a National ODF alliance, India too would be playing a pivotal role in spearheading the ODF revolution. Further, considering the huge potential of eGovernance in the nation as well as the need to adopt open standards to make our data systems more inter-operable and independent of any limiting proprietary tools, we feel that ODF is a great technological leap and a big boon to further propel IT right to India's grass root levels. I congratulate this initiative of leading private & public organisations and wish them all the best in this endeavor.\\" The Allahabad High Court of India has decided, as policy, to use OpenDocument format for its documents. Assam Government agencies are required to: * Use ODF * Transition to open-source operating systems Kerala In 2007 Kerala released an Information Technology Policy designed to turn Kerala into a knowledge society. They decided that open standards such as ODF would be followed in e-governance projects to avoid proprietary lock in. = Japan = On June 29, 2007, the government of Japan published a new interoperability framework which gives preference to the procurement of products that follow open standards including the ODF standards. On July 2 the government declared that they wouldn't stop from adopting alternative document formats, because they hold the view that formats like Office Open XML which other organizations such as Ecma International and ISO had also approved was, according to them, an open standard, too. Also, they said that it was one of the preferences, whether the format is open, to choose which software the government shall deploy. Government ministries and agencies are required to: * Solicit bids from software vendors whose products support internationally recognized open standards Open formats: * Are to be preferred, and * Must be used to promote exchange of information between ministries Japan's Diet passed an open standards software incentive as part of its omnibus Special Taxation Measures law: * Provides tax reductions for companies which buy open-standard based software * Went into effect April 2008 and expires in March 2011. = Malaysia = In August 2007, The Malaysian government announced plans to adopt open standards and the Open Document Format (ODF) within the country's public sector. The Malaysian Administration Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU) issued a tender for a nine-month study to evaluate the usage of open standards. From April 2008 on the use of ODF is mandatory within the public sector.Open Malaysia: MAMPU migrates to OpenOffice.org and ODF to increase freedom of choice and interoperability = South Korea = South Korean government adopted OpenDocument as a part of Korean Industrial Standards KS X ISO/IEC 26300 in 2007, but public documents are still made and distributed in .hwp format. There is no regulation of legislation about OpenDocument since 2007. =Taiwan= Already in 2009 ODF was chosen as official standard. But only from 2014 large scale migrations to ODF (and because of freedom of choice that brought) to LibreOffice started. Europe The European Commission has, since at least 2003, been investigating various options for storing documents in an XML-based format, commissioning technical studies such as the \\"Valoris Report\\".Valoris (2004). Comparative Assessment of Open Documents Formats Market Overview aka the \\"Valoris Report\\". In March 2004, the Telematics between Administrations Committee (TAC) asked an OpenOffice team and a Microsoft team to present on the relative merits of their XML-based office document formats.Bray, Tim. (September 24‚Äì26, 2004) SmartEC (Accessed on October 17, 2005. (Discussing Open Office XML ISO Certification).) In May 2004, TAC issued a set of recommendations, in particular noting that, \\"Because of its specific role in society, the public sector must avoid [a situation where] a specific product is forced on anyone interacting with it electronically. Conversely, any document format that does not discriminate against market actors and that can be implemented across platforms should be encouraged. Likewise, the public sector should avoid any format that does not safeguard equal opportunities to market actors to implement format-processing applications, especially where this might impose product selection on the side of citizens or businesses. In this respect standardisation initiatives will ensure not only a fair and competitive market but will also help safeguard the interoperability of implementing solutions whilst preserving competition and innovation.\\" It then issued recommendations, including: * Industry actors not currently involved with the OASIS Open Document Format consider participating in the standardisation process in order to encourage a wider industry consensus around the format; * Microsoft considers issuing a public commitment to publish and provide non- discriminatory access to future versions of its WordML specifications; * Microsoft should consider the merits of submitting XML formats to an international standards body of their choice; * Industry is encouraged to provide filters that allow documents based on the WordML specifications and the emerging OASIS Open Document Format to be read and written to other applications whilst maintaining a maximum degree of faithfulness to content, structure and presentation. These filters should be made available for all products; * The public sector is encouraged to provide its information through several formats. Where by choice or circumstance only a single revisable document format can be used this should be for a format around which there is industry consensus, as demonstrated by the format's adoption as a standard.Telematics between Administrations Committee (TAC). (May 25, 2004) TAC Approval on Conclusions and Recommendations on Open Document Formats. (Accessed on October 17, 2005.) An official recommendation for a certain format was not issued however. =Belgium= A memorandum on the use of open standards for creating and exchanging office documents was approved by Belgium's federal Council of Ministers on June 23, 2006.

The decision was made after deep research of ODF possibilities. Other ministries may follow.Oikeusministeri√∂ - Justitieministeriet - Etusivu =France= According to French government's RGI (general interoperability framework), ODF is the \\"recommended format for office documents within French administrations\\". OOXML is tolerated for \\"information exchange needs through tables\\". Government agencies are required to: * Accept documents submitted in XML formats: ODF format as like OOxml format (both are in \\"Observations\\") * Use PDF/A to preserve text documents Government agencies are encouraged to: * Install OpenOffice.org (an open-source, ODF-based productivity suite) * Use ODF to create text documents, spreadsheets, and slideshow-style presentations Government agencies are prohibited from: * Migrating to any productivity suite formats other than ODF = Germany = A large number of Bundesl√§nder, state and goverenmental offices and cities widely use products that support ODF (e.g. LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org).  Federal  In December 2008 the governmental IT-Board of the Bundesregierung decided to make use of the ODF- Format in the Federal administration in order to improve IT-security and interoperability.Bundesministerium des Innern: IT-Rat der Bundesregierung er√∂ffnet den Einsatz offener Dokumentenformate (ODF). The Federal Foreign Office has migrated totally to the use of ODF formats also in the 250 foreign offices abroad (it has reduced its IT costs to a third in comparison to other Ministries ). In a message to the participants of the first international ODF- workshop in October 2007 the Federal Foreign Minister stated: \\"The Open Document Format, as a completely open and ISO standardized format, is an excellent vehicle for the free exchange of knowledge and information in the globalized age.\\" The Federal office for security in IT (Bundesamt f√ºr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik ) uses with StarOffice on all computers the ODF format in a cast deployment. Since September 2007 all communications with the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) and the Federal Patent Court (Bundespatentgericht) may be transmitted in the ODF format. The same has already applied for a while to other high courts, i.e. the Bundesarbeitsgericht,Formatstandards / Versionen the BundessozialgerichtFormatstandards / Versionen and many other courts in the Bundesland of Nordrhein-Westfalen Formatstandards / Versionen Formatstandards / Versionen and of the Free State of Saxony (Sachsen).Formatstandards / Versionen Federal agencies will be able to receive, read, send and edit ODF documents beginning no later than 2010. Under Germany's Standards and Architectures for eGovernment Applications 4.0 (SAGA 4.0), ODF recommended for editable text documents, a multi-stakeholder initiative that recommends and mandates standards to be used by the German federal government.  Bundesl√§nder  The City of Freiburg in Baden-W√ºrttemberg uses OpenOffice.org and OpenDocument.Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau: Offene Standards in der √∂ffentlichen Verwaltung The City of Munich in Bavaria has already migrated 14000 desktops to OpenOffice.org and OpenDocument while migrating as a whole to Linux. =Italy= The Italian standardization organization UNI adopted ISO/IEC 26300 (ODF 1.0) on January 26, 2007 (UNI CEI ISO/IEC 26300:2007). The Italian region of Umbria announced its migration to LibreOffice and OpenDocument format In 2015, the Italian Ministry of Defence announced that it would standardise on ODF and install LibreOffice on 150,000 PCs. = Netherlands = From the beginning of 2009 onwards, open source software and the ODF format will be the standard for reading, publishing and the exchange of information for all governmental organisations. Whenever the software used is not open source special reasons have to be given.GotzeBlogged ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Netherlands Picks ODF =Norway= Norway's Ministry of Government Administration and Reform decided in December 2007 that ODF (ISO/IEC 26300) MUST be used from 2009 when publishing documents that are meant to be changed after downloading, i.e. forms that are to be filled in by the user. So all website forums will use this format. From 2010 it is mandatory for all government agencies to use document formats (PDF or) ODF when exchanging documents as attachments to e-mail between government and users. =Portugal= In 2008, the Portuguese Parliament discussed a bill proposed by the PCP) determining that the adoption of open standard formats ‚Äì namely ODF ‚Äì shall be mandatory within all public administration agencies. On 21 June 2011, the government published a law on Open Standards.Associa√ß√£o de Empresas de Software Open Source Portuguesas: Portuguese Parliament, Law n. 36/2011, On the adoption of Open Standards in the Information Systems of the State June 21, 2011 (PDF; 40 kB) On 8 November 2012, the list of mandatory standards was published: ODF version 1.1 becomes obligatory in July 2014.http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2012/11/21600/0646006465.pdf page=3 In March 2012, the C√¢mara Municipal de Vieira do Minho (county of Vieira do Minho) in Portugal announced its migration to LibreOffice. =Romania= Despite the heated discussions about adopting Free Software and Open Standards in Romanian public administration - especially at eLiberatica 2009 - the Romanian Ministry for Communications and Information Society passed no official bill to enforce the use of Open Standards, particularly OpenDocument. In June 2009, the minister Gabriel Sandu declared, in an interview to Ziarul Financiar, that ‚Äûwe cannot give up Microsoft licenses overnight‚Äù, despite the harsh critics from the large national Free Software community and a few important local IT businesses. However, the OpenDocument format and OpenDocument-capable software are widely used, not only by enthusiasts, but by businesses as well, including large parts of the Romanian government agencies, mayoralties, courts, notaries, insurance firms, accountants, engineers, etc. A (grossly incomplete) list of implementations, including Romania, is maintained here =Russia= The Russian standardization organization Federal Agency on Technical Regulating and Metrology adopted ISO/IEC 26300 as national standard GOST R ISO/IEC 26300-2010 (–ì–û–°–¢ –† –ò–°–û/–ú–≠–ö 26300-2010) on December 21, 2010. =Serbia= Government administration is required to: * Use the ISO 19005 - Electronic document file format for long-term preservation (PDF/A format) for official electronic documents. * For drafts, proposals and templates one of the following format should be used: ** ISO 26300 - Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0 ** ISO 29500 - Office Open XML File Formats If any other specialized file format is used for technical reasons, all parties in the document exchange must agree that there is a technical interoperability for using that file format. = Slovakia = In Slovakia, all public authorities should be able to read ODF format since August 2006 and can use this format for electronic communication and for publication of documents. Since October 2008, public authorities must be able to read text documents in ODF 1.0 format. Since July 2010, public authorities must be able to read text documents in ODF format up to version 1.2. Since March 2009, documents in ODF 1.0 format are allowed for use with the electronic signature and qualified electronic signature. = Spain =  Andalusia  Government agencies are required to: * Use open standards to interchange documents with citizens, non-governmental organizations, and other government bodies‚Äù ** ODF ** PDF **PDF/A ** HTML ** XHTML ** ASCII ** UNICODE ** ASCII (open) ** RTF (acceptable) Extremadura Government agencies are required to: * Create and save in ODF (manipulable) or PDF/A (static) format all documents that will be exchanged with other government entities or with citizens. = Switzerland = Government agencies are required to: * Use the following formats when exchanging documents with citizens or other agencies: ** PDF/A (‚Äúurgently recommended‚Äù) ** PDF/X (‚Äúrecommended‚Äù) ** ODF (‚Äúrecommended‚Äù) ** OOXML (‚Äúrecommended‚Äù) = Sweden = Sweden has published ODF 1.0 as a national in August 2008. This has not been announced officially. The standards institute only added the prefix \\"SS\\" before the ISO number SS- ISO/IEC 26300:2008. = Turkey = A memorandum on the use of open standards for creating and exchanging office documents is being strongly suggested by Turkish Ministry of Development since 2008. According to \\"Interoperability Report\\" Turkish Ministry of Development, government agencies are required to: * Create and save in ODF or PDF format all documents that will be exchanged with other government entities or with citizens. = United Kingdom = Under the ‚ÄúOpen Source, Open Standards and Re‚ÄìUse: Government Action Plan‚Äù the UK government will specify requirements by reference to open standards and require compliance with open standards in solutions where feasible. The government indicated it will support the use of ODF 1.0 (ISO/IEC 26300:2006). BECTA (British Education Communication Technology Agency) is the UK agency in charge of defining information technology (IT) policy for all schools in the United Kingdom, including standards for all the schools' infrastructure. In 2005 they published a comprehensive document describing the policy for infrastructure in schools. This document highly recommends the use of OpenDocument and a few other formats for office document data. BECTA explains this as follows: \\"Any office application used by institutions must be able to be saved to (and so viewed by others) using a commonly agreed format that ensures an institution is not locked into using specific software. The main aim is for all office based applications to provide functionality to meet the specifications described here (whether licensed software, open source or unlicensed freeware) and thus many application providers could supply the educational institution ICT market.\\".

South America = Argentina = In September 2007 the Argentinian Province of Misiones decided via decrete that the use of ODF shall be mandatory within the government.Gobierno Electr√≥nico de la Provincia de Misiones Around a million people live in this province, which is one of the 23 provinces of Argentina. = Brazil = With the publication of \\"e-Ping Interoperability Framework\\",e-Ping Interoperability Framework Brazil became the first South American country to officially recommend the adoption of OpenDocuments within the government. As stated in version v3.0 of 2007: \\"Preferred adoption of Open Formats: e-PING defines that, whenever possible, open standards will be used in technical specifications. \\"Proprietary standards\\" will be accepted, in this transition period, with the perspective of replacement as soon as there are conditions for a complete migration. With no loss to these goals, are to be respected those situations when there is the need to consider security requisites and information integrity. When available, Free Software solutions are to be considered preferential, accordingly with the policy defined by the Comit√™ Executivo de Governo Eletr√¥nico (CEGE)\\" Since April 2008 ODF is a national standard in Brazil, coded as NBRISO/IEC26300.NBR ISO/IEC 26300 As of the 2010 version, the transition period has officially ended, and proprietary document formats may no longer be used in the federal public administration, although in practice this is not the case in many federal agencies and departments. Additionally, a number of parties, including local governments, companies and non-governmental organizations have signed into the Bras√≠lia Protocol, which formalize intentions and set goals for adopting the use of the Open Document standard. Paran√° Government agencies and state-owned companies are required to: * Use ODF for the creation, storage, and display of all electronic documents = Uruguay = Since June 2008 the \\"Agency for the Development of Government Electronic Management and Information and Knowledge Society of Uruguay\\" recommends that public documents use either ODF or PDF. ODF should be used for documents in the process of being edited and the latter for documents in final form. http://www.agesic.gub.uy/innovaportal/file/497/1/estandares_ofimatica_v20.pdf = Venezuela = All organizations of the Federal Government of Venezuela must: * Use ODF 1.0 (ISO/IEC 26300) for editable documents * Use PDF for non- editable documents  North America  = Canada = Canadian governments do not have mandatory file formats. Microsoft office products are widely used by all levels of governments in Canada. = United States = Massachusetts The United States state of Massachusetts has been examining its options for implementing XML-based document processing. In early 2005, Eric Kriss, Secretary of Administration and Finance in Massachusetts, was the first government official in the United States to publicly connect open formats to a public policy purpose: \\"It is an overriding imperative of the American democratic system that we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access.\\" At a September 16, 2005 meeting with the Mass Technology Leadership Council Kriss stated that he believes this is fundamentally an issue of sovereignty. While supporting the principle of private intellectual property rights, he said sovereignty trumped any private company's attempt to control the state's public records through claims of intellectual property. Subsequently, in September 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to formally endorse OpenDocument formats for its public records and, at the same time, reject Microsoft's new XML format, now standardized as ISO/IEC 29500:2008 ‚Äî Office Open XML. This decision was made after a two-year examination of file formats, including many discussions with Microsoft, other vendors, and various experts, plus some limited trial programs in individual communities like Saugus and Billerica. Microsoft Office, which has a nearly 100% market share among the state's employees, did not support OpenDocument formats until Service Pack 2 of Office 2007. Microsoft had indicated that OpenDocument formats will not be supported in new versions of Office, even though they support many other formats (including ASCII, RTF, and WordPerfect), and analysts believe it would be easy for Microsoft to implement the standard. If Microsoft chooses not to implement OpenDocument, Microsoft will disqualify themselves from future consideration. Several analysts (such as Ovum) believe that Microsoft will eventually support OpenDocument. On 6 July 2006 Microsoft announced that they would support the OpenDocument format and create a plugin to allow Office to save to ODF. After this announcement by Massachusetts supporting OpenDocument, a large number of people and organizations spoke up about the policy, both pro and con (see the references section). Adobe, Corel, IBM, and Sun all sent letters to Massachusetts supporting the measure. In contrast, Microsoft sent in a letter highly critical of the measure. A group named \\"Citizens Against Government Waste\\" (CAGW) also opposed the decision. The group claimed that Massachusetts' policy established \\"an arbitrary preference for open source,\\" though both open source software and proprietary software can implement the specification, and both kinds of developers were involved in creating the standard (CAGW, 2005). However, InternetNews and Linux Weekly News noted that CAGW has received funding from Microsoft, and that in 2001 CAGW was caught running an astroturfing campaign on behalf of Microsoft when two letters they submitted supporting Microsoft in Microsoft's anti-trust case were found to have the signatures of deceased persons (Linux Weekly News). James Prendergast, executive director of a coalition named \\"Americans for Technology Leadership\\" (ATL), also criticized the state's decision in a Fox News article. In the article, Prendergast failed to disclose that Microsoft is a founding member of ATL. Fox News later published a follow-up article disclosing that fact.FOX News, 2005; Jones, September 29, 2005 State Senator Marc R. Pacheco and State Secretary William F. Galvin have expressed reservations about this plan. Pacheco held a hearing on October 31, 2005, on the topic of OpenDocument. Pacheco did not want OpenDocument to be declared as the executive branch standard, primarily on procedural grounds. Pacheco believed that the executive branch had to receive permission to set an executive standard from the multi- branch IT Advisory Board. In contrast, The Massachusetts Information Technology Division (ITD), and its general council, believe the Advisory board's role is to advise ITD, and ITD did discuss the issue with the IT Advisory Board, but ITD's Peter J. Quinn and Linda Hamel (ITD's General Counsel) asserted that there is no requirement that \\"ITD approach the Advisory Board for permission to adopt policies that will impact only the Executive Department.\\" Hamel later filed a legal briefing justifying ITD's position (Hamel, 2005). Massachusetts' Supreme Court has ruled that the various branches of government are prohibited from mandating IT standards on each other; this ruling appears to support ITD's claim. Pacheco also did not like the process used to select OpenDocument. However, Pacheco appears to have had many fundamental misunderstandings of the issues. Andy Updegrove said that at the time, \\"Senator Pacheco doesn't understand the difference between open source and open standards (and certainly doesn't understand the difference between OpenDocument and OpenOffice). More than once, he indicated that he thought that the policy would require the Executive Agencies to use OpenOffice.org, not realizing that there are other compliant alternatives. He also thought that this would act to the detriment of Massachusetts software vendors, who (he thinks) would be excluded from doing business with the Commonwealth.\\" Pacheco also thought that OpenOffice.org was under the GPL, but in fact it is released under the LGPL (Jones, October 31, 2005) (Jones, November 14, 2005). He attempted to halt implementation of OpenDocument in the executive branch via an amendment (to S. 2256), but the amended bill was never sent to the governor. Since then in 2007 Massachusetts has amended its approved technical standards list to include Office Open XML. =References= Official Information Documents from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: * (RTF) Enterprise Open Standards Policy (ETRM) Version 4.0 * (RTF) Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM) Version 4.0, effective July 2007.

In April 2006, a bill was introduced in the Minnesota state legislature to require all state agencies to use open data formats. It is expected that the OpenDocument Format will be advanced as a way of meeting the proposed requirement. (Gardner, April 7, 2006).

Every 2 years the Senate members are appointed by the President of the Senate, and the House members by the Speaker of the House. No more than 3 regular members, and 3 alternate members, from each chamber may be from the same party. The JLCAR may approve, conditionally approve, or object to final agency proposals or proposed interim rules. JLCAR approval is not required except for a proposed interim rule. Agencies may amend a proposed rule in response to an objection and still seek JLCAR approval, or the agency may withdraw the rule. The JLCAR may not object to an emergency rule but may petition for its repeal if the agency has not demonstrated that the rule is necessary to prevent an imminent peril to the public health or safety. An agency may not adopt a proposed regular rule after responding to an objection until the JLCAR has had an opportunity to examine the response and decide whether to approve the rule, make a final objection, or vote to support the introduction of a joint resolution. A final objection by the JLCAR is not a veto nor does it delay adoption of a rule, but it does shift the burden of proof to the agency on the lawfulness of the rule in a court challenge or court enforcement action of the rule.

It was colloquially referred to as simply Mirro.  History  = Founding - 1940 = The roots of the company can be traced to the founding of three companies: the Aluminum Manufacturing Company founded by Joseph Koenig in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, in 1895; the Manitowoc Aluminum Novelty Company, founded in neighboring Manitowoc, Wisconsin, by Henry Vits in 1898; and the New Jersey Aluminum Company founded in 1890 in Newark, New Jersey. In 1909, the three companies merged,Louis Falge (ed.). History of Manitowoc County Wisconsin, vol. 2. Chicago: Goodspeed Historical Association: 1911-1912, pp. 210-213. and the resulting company was renamed the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company. It was headquartered in Manitowoc and headed by Vits as president and Koenig as vice president.Falge, vol. 2, pp. 54-57. In 1910, in a $200,000 deal between George Vits and the eastern capitalists, all offices and manufacturing were moved to Manitowoc. The company received its first government contract in 1911, winning an $80,000 contract to build aluminum canteens developed by Joseph Koenig for the army. Koening filed for a patent in April 1911 and was granted patent US1062716 in May 1913. By 1914, the company reported that its employment was over 400 and building space had grown to almost 90,000 sq ft. In 1915 the company acquired the facilities of the Standard Aluminum Company, another manufacturer in Two Rivers. For the next two years the company concentrated on the production of cooking utensils.Evan Gagnon, Neshotah: The Story of Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Stevens Point, WI: Worzalla, 1969, p. 236.

Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 55, no. 2 (Winter, 1971-1972): 86-99. The company continued to grow and by 1920 had increased its capital to $12,000,000. = 1941-1982 = During World War II Mirro retooled its factories to make aluminum products for the military. When the war ended in 1945, the company expanded into aluminum toys, making the popular Sno- Coaster saucer shaped sled. In 1957 shareholders approved a name change to the Mirro Aluminum Company. In 1958, Mirro began manufacturing a line of 16 ft aluminum boats under the Mirro-Craft name. The boats, introduced at the Chicago National Boat Show in February of that year, were designed by naval architect David Beach. Shipment of production boats did not start until January 1959. In late 1971, Mirro purchased Cruisers, Inc., of Oconto, Wisconsin, a manufacturer of Fiberglass boats ranging in length from 16 ft to 25 ft. At its peak, Mirro was the world's largest manufacturer of aluminum cooking utensils, and over time it had as many as eight plants in three states, with products ranging from pots and pans to small boats and aluminum siding. In 1982 the boat business was divested. It was purchased by employees and moved to Gillett, Wisconsin, to a plant formerly owned by Mirro. The new company was named Northport, Inc. The MirroCraft tradename was transferred to the new company. In 2003 Northport was purchased by Weeres pontoons of St. Cloud, Minnesota. The fiberglass boat portion was sold to Cruisers, Incorporated of Oconto, Wisconsin. This company is now known as Cruisers Yachts. = 1983-2003 = Mirro was acquired by The Newell Companies in 1983. Facing competition from other manufacturers, Newell had moved most of its Manitowoc area operations out of the country by 2001, and shuttered the most modern of the area Mirro plants in 2003. Mirro also closed its administrative offices in Manitowoc at that time, ending the company's 118-year history in the area. = Post 2003 = The manufacturing facility in the industrial park on Mirro Drive on the northeast of Manitowoc, was purchased by Koenig & Vits, Inc., when it closed. They formed an alliance in 2005 with Tramontina, a Brazil-based cookware and cutlery manufacture to manufacture cookware in Manitowoc at the plant. July 8, 201 the company announced it is closing the Manitowoc manufacturing plant, laying off 145 workers. The current owner of the plant, Skana Aluminum, was incorporated in 2009. The plant is currently operated as a contract custom aluminum rolling mill. As of July 2014, The trademark name Mirro () was registered to Groupe SEB. The trademark for MIRRO CRAFT () was renewed in 2009 by Northport Marine LLC of Gillett, Wisconsin.

His most famous work was on the Ramsey‚ÄìCass‚ÄìKoopmans model of economic growth. Biography David Cass was born in 1937 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He earned an A.B. in economics from the University of Oregon in 1958 and started to study law at the Harvard Law School as he thought of becoming a lawyer according to family tradition. As he hated studying law he left the program after one year and served in the army from 1959 to 1960. He then entered the economics Ph.D. program at Stanford University. Here he met Karl Shell, although the two began to work together only after both graduated. Cass' doctoral advisor was Hirofumi Uzawa, who also introduced him to Tjalling Koopmans, who at that time was a professor at Yale University. In 1965, Cass graduated with a Ph.D. in economics and statistics with a dissertation on optimal growth, with parts of the dissertation later published in the Review of Economic Studies. After graduation Cass began to work from 1965 to 1970 as an assistant professor at the economics department of Yale University and as a research associate at the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics in New Haven. During his time at Yale University he collaborated with Menahem Yaari and Joseph Stiglitz and worked mostly on overlapping generations models. In 1970 he left New Haven for Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he was a professor of economics until 1974. During his time at Carnegie-Mellon he began to collaborate with Karl Shell, who at this time was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. One of his doctoral students was Finn E. Kydland, who would later win the Nobel Prize in Economics. In 1974 Cass left for the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor of economics until his death. David Cass died in 2008 in Philadelphia after a long illness. He was divorced and the father of two children. Cass was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1970, was an elected fellow of the Econometric Society since 1972, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Geneva in 1994, was a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association in 1999 and was an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2003. Research Cass made important contributions to pure economic theory, mostly in the field of general equilibrium theory. He made major contributions to the theory of optimal growth, the theory of sunspots and the theory of incomplete markets. He is perhaps best known for his article ‚ÄúOptimum Growth in an Aggregative Model of Capital Accumulation‚Äù, which was a part of his dissertation. In this paper he proves a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by Frank Ramsey. A major difference to the standard Ramsey growth model was that Cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted, thus implicitly assuming that consumers prefer consumption today to consumption tomorrow. This modified version of the Ramsey growth model is also known as the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model, named after Frank Ramsey, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans. He was also famous for the \\"Cass criterion\\" for overlapping generations models and in the neoclassical growth model, and his work, together with Karl Shell, on the influence of extrinsic uncertainty on economic equilibria, also known as the concept of sunspot equilibria or the theory of sunspots. Together with Joseph Stiglitz he proved conditions under which it is possible for an investor to achieve an optimal portfolio under the restriction of being able to buy only two mutual funds. They also showed that generally the demand for money can not be derived from portfolio theory. Cass was also a major contributor to the theory of incomplete markets, the turnpike theory and theory of economies with markets that repeatedly open over time. =Cass's Scientific Works= Dave Cass's first major contribution to economics was the characterization of optimal growth trajectories in his thesis work under Hirofumi Uzawa‚Äôs supervision at Stanford University. The celebrated Cass criterion for optimal time paths in the one good growth model quickly followed. The essence of this work is the search for price characterizations of efficiency for dynamic time paths, an effort that directly pointed the way to the subsequent full dynamic decentralization of the neoclassical optimal growth model, a fact that permits its use for modeling a wide range of business cycle and other macroeconomic phenomena. Accordingly, Cass is rightly honored, together with Tjalling Koopmans and Frank Ramsey, as one of the fathers of dynamic macroeconomic analysis. The original papers from Cass's thesis were :‚Ä¢ \\"Optimum economic growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation,\\" published in The Review of Economic Studies in 1965 :‚Ä¢ \\"Optimum economic growth in the two- sector model of capital accumulation\\" :‚Ä¢ \\"Optimum economic growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation: A turnpike theorem,\\" published in Econometrica in 1966 The \\"Optimum growth...\\" paper was the culmination of a long line of research (beginning with Frank Ramsey's pioneering research in the 1920s) on modeling economic growth. The literature found expression in the post-war period in the work of Robert Solow at MIT and Hirofumi Uzawa at Stanford, not only as a theory of growth, but also as a tool for understanding the macroeconomy. Much of the development of the models in the literature was grounded in a set of post-war \\"stylized facts\\" that every economics Ph.D. student learns in their first year of graduate study. One of the weak links in the development of these early models was their specification of saving behavior as being exogenous and given by the empirical regularity of the consumption-income relationship, and the various (partial equilibrium) theories of consumption spending designed to explain this regularity. Cass's paper was the first to endogenize the consumption-savings decision by deriving an optimal capital accumulation trajectory that maximized the discounted sum of utility payoffs over time. The tools that Cass used to derive his results were from the then-newly developed field of optimal control in mathematics pioneered by Lev Pontryagin. The main results in the paper are a demonstration that under now-standard assumptions on preferences and technology, the optimal accumulation sequence exists and is unique. The other papers in Cass's thesis drew on the major insights of the \\"Optimum growth...\\" paper by extending them to show the existence of an optimal growth trajectory in a two-sector model of capital accumulation, and the existence of a so-called turnpike growth path associated with the optimal capital accumulation trajectory in the one-sector model. These papers were published (possibly even completed) while Cass was a research staff member and then an assistant professor at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University (1964‚Äì1967). Cass was promoted to untenured associate professor at Cowles and remained at Yale until 1970. He coauthored several more papers during this time with Joseph Stiglitz and Menahem Yaari, who were also at Yale during this period. These included: :‚Ä¢ \\"A re-examination of the pure consumption loans model\\" (with M.E. Yaari). J Pol Econ 74, 353-367 (1966). :‚Ä¢ \\"Individual saving, aggregate capital accumulation and efficient growth\\" (with M.E. Yaari). Essays in the Theory of Optimal Economic Growth (K. Shell, ed.), MIT, 1967. :‚Ä¢ \\"The implications of alternative saving and expectations hypotheses for the choice of techniques and patterns of growth\\" (with J.E. Stiglitz). J Pol Econ 77, 586-627 (1969). :‚Ä¢ \\"The structure of investor preferences and asset returns, and separability in portfolio allocation\\" (with J.E. Stiglitz). J Econ Theory 2, 122-160 (1970). :‚Ä¢ \\"Present values playing the role of efficiency prices in the one-good growth model\\" (with M.E. Yaari). Rev Econ Studies 38, 331-339 (1971). In the Spear and Wright Macroeconomic Dynamics interview with Cass, he indicates that his work with Manny Yaari at Yale constituted his introduction to Samuelson's consumption loans (now overlapping generations) model, which would come front and center as a major workhorse model in Cass's subsequent work with Karl Shell on sunspot equilibria. During this time, Cass also looked more deeply at the question of how individual saving behavior and efficient growth were related. The paper on present values as efficiency prices that Cass co- authored with Yaari is easily seen to be a precursor of his subsequent work at Carnegie Mellon on capital overaccumulation and efficiency which led to the famous Cass criterion for determining inefficiency. Finally, Cass's work with Stiglitz on modeling investor preferences and asset returns provided a foundation for his later work on financial general equilibrium. Cass left Yale in 1970, describing himself as part of Yale's \\"junior through-put.\\" He was recruited by Dick Cyert, then Dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University. During his time at GSIA, Cass completed the work on capital overaccumulation, continued his work with Joe Stiglitz on asset pricing, and began work exploring the general applicability of the mathematical techniques he had used in his thesis (mathematical programming, duality and the Hamiltonian approach to dynamic control). The papers produced during this period included: :‚Ä¢ \\"On capital overaccumulation in the aggregative, neoclassical model of economic growth: A complete characterization,\\" J Econ Theory 4, 200-203 (1972). :‚Ä¢ \\"Distinguishing inefficient competitive growth paths: A note on capital overaccumulation and rapidly diminishing future value of consumption in a fairly general model of capitalistic production.\\" J Econ Theory 4, 224-240 (1972). :‚Ä¢ \\"Risk aversion and wealth effects on portfolios with many assets\\" (with J.E. Stiglitz).

While the last two papers were published after Cass left GSIA, he indicates in the interview that he began this work while he was still at Carnegie Mellon. Cass‚Äôs second seminal contribution ‚Äì the notion of a so-called sunspot equilibrium in dynamic economies which he developed jointly with Karl Shell‚Äîis also the stuff of legend, and grew out of his long and productive collaboration with Karl at Penn. The early impetus for Cass‚Äôs interest in this topic stemmed from work he did with Manny Yaari on overlapping generations models, and from his early acquaintance with Bob Lucas at Carnegie Mellon and Lucas‚Äôs seminal work on rational expectations in dynamic economic models. To quote from the Spear- Wright interview ::I wasn‚Äôt so interested in macro, but what struck me, and this is related to some of my later work, was the assumption that [Lucas] made to solve for equilibrium, that the state variables were obvious.... Bob and I had some long discussions, and I would say, ‚ÄúWell Bob, why is this the actual state space in this model?‚Äù That question came up ... after I came to Penn. At some point Karl [Shell] and I started talking about that and we developed what we called the idea of sunspots. The key paper that came out of Cass's and Karl's discussions was the \\"Do sunspots matter?\\" paper published in the Journal of Political Economy in 1983. Much of the work leading up to this paper focused on the overlapping generations model: :‚Ä¢ \\"The role of money in supporting the Pareto optimality of competitive equilibrium in consumption- loan type models\\" (with M. Okuno and I. Zilcha). J Econ Theory 20, 41-80 (1979). :‚Ä¢ \\"In defense of a basic approach\\" (with K. Shell). Models of Monetary Economies (J.H. Kareken and N. Wallace, eds.), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1980. :‚Ä¢ \\"Existence of competitive equilibrium in a general overlapping-generations model\\" (with Y. Balasko and K. Shell). J Econ Theory 23, 307-322 (1980). The first actual model of sunspot equilibrium was produced by Shell in an OLG framework with linear utility functions, which appeared in his \\"Monnai et allocation intertemporelle\\" in 1977, as part of the Malinvaud lecture series in Paris (now published as a vintage paper in Macroeconomic Dynamics). Cass and Shell's JPE paper presented a simplified, two-period dynamic model in which one of two sets of agents could trade assets contingent on prices in the second period, while the second set of agents could only trade on the second period spot markets. This captured the friction of restricted participation present in OLG economies, where some agents (the newly entering young) are born into a specific state and cannot insure themselves against outcomes in the birth state. The paper demonstrated that in static Arrow-Debreu economies with complete markets, extrinsic uncertainty (where no fundamentals of the model are stochastic) cannot matter to equilibrium allocations. They then showed that when some agents were restricted in their trades, so that market completeness was violated, sunspots could matter, i.e. there could exist rational expectations equilibria in which equilibrium prices depended on the realization of an extrinsic stochastic process. In passing, they made the observation that since the validity of the first welfare theorem implied that there could be no sunspot equilibria, a necessary condition for the existence of such equilibria was a violation of the conditions under which the first welfare theorem holds. This observation took on a life of its own as what Shell called the Philadelphia Pholk theorem: if the first welfare theorem doesn't hold, then you can find an economy where sunspots matter. In addition to raising troubling questions about what the right state space was for dynamic stochastic economies, the notion of sunspot equilibrium raised a number of deep questions about the overall determinacy of economic equilibria and the role of the welfare theorems in the occurrence or non-occurrence of sunspot equilibria. These questions spawned a large literature on determinacy in dynamic economies in which the welfare theorems broke down. These include overlapping generations models, growth models with externalities or taxes, and models in which asset markets were incomplete. All were shown to allow the existence of sunspot equilibria. And, in a suitable twist of intellectual fate, macroeconomists have recently begun to explore the question of whether sunspot expectations can provide a more plausible source of fluctuations in dynamic equilibrium models than the conventional aggregate productivity disturbances. Cass‚Äôs third major contribution to economic theory was his work on general equilibrium with incomplete markets, work which grew out of his exploration of the question of existence of sunspot equilibria in models with incomplete asset markets. Cass‚Äôs follow-on work on existence and determinacy of general equilibrium in models with incomplete asset markets spawned another large literature which has come to be known simply as GEI. As an historical note, Cass never really liked this terminology, preferring instead to think of these models as ones of General Financial Equilibrium (GFE) to emphasize the presence of financial assets and the frictions these introduced. The earliest work on market incompleteness goes back to Arrow in the 1950s, Diamond in the mid-‚Äò60‚Äôs and a number of related papers in the finance literature between the late 1950s and early ‚Äò70‚Äôs (Geanakoplos provides an excellent survey of this literature). The canonical GEI model was formulated by Radner in the early 1970s in a paper which also pointed up one of the fundamental puzzles about models with incomplete markets: the possible loss of dimensionality in the span of the asset payoffs as prices vary. This potential for non-existence of equilibrium (which was formally developed in Hart‚Äôs counterexamples to existence of equilibrium) left the literature in limbo for almost a decade, until Cass‚Äôs work on existence in economies with purely financial assets pointed the way out. As Geanakoplos notes ::Suddenly in the middle 1980s the pure theory of GEI fell into place. In two provocative and influential papers, Cass showed that the existence of equilibrium could be guaranteed if all the assets promise delivery in fiat money, and he gave an example showing that with such financial assets there could be a multiplicity of equilibrium. Almost simultaneously Werner also gave a proof of existence of equilibrium with financial assets, and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis showed the same for economies with real assets that promise delivery in the same consumption good. The first paper that Geanakoplos references above appeared initially in April 1984 as a CARESS Working Paper. This work was followed very quickly by results showing that the non-existence problem pointed out by Hart was not generic, and led ultimately to the generic existence results of Duffie and Shafer, and again spawned a new literature looking positively at the welfare implication of market incompleteness, and normatively at issues of asset engineering. In the time after this seminal work in GEI, Cass's various papers dealt with issues of determinacy of equilibrium (and the closely related issue of existence of sunspot equilibria), and with the optimality of allocations in the presence of sunspots and incomplete asset markets.

Econ. Theory, 142, 100-127 (2008) To round out this summary of Cass's work, despite the very strong evolution of his ideas from his initial work on optimal growth, to the work on sunspots and finally on market incompleteness, Cass continued to be interested in his older interests when he saw opportunities for contributions. Thus, his 1979 paper with Mukul Majumdar, \\"Efficient intertemporal allocation, consumption-value maximization and capital-value transversality: A unified view\\" and his 1991 paper with Tappan Mitra, \\"Indefinitely sustained consumption despite exhaustible natural resources\\" hearken back to his earlier work on capital theory. Similarly, his 1996 paper with Chichilnisky and Wu, \\"Individual risk and mutual insurance: A reformulation\\" (Econometrica 64, 333-341) and his 2004 paper with his student Anna Pavlova, \\"On trees and logs\\" (J Econ Theory 116, 41-83) hearkens back to his original work on asset pricing models with Joe Stiglitz. Cass's last published paper was \\"Compatible beliefs and equilibrium\\" (2008, J. Math. Econ. 44, 625-640) Cass describes this paper as a concept paper, in which he goes back to the primitives of economic theory and asks what beliefs economic agents must hold in order to justify the conventional assumption of competitive equilibrium. Cass's last paper, \\"Utility-based utility\\" was under revision at the time of his death. This paper is also conceptual in nature in showing that sunspot equilibria could exist under weaker specifications of preferences than the standard von Neumann-Morgenstern specification. Personal life David Cass was outspoken about academic and personal freedom. In 1994 he became involved in an administrative dispute with the University of Pennsylvania over the implications of a consensual faculty-student relationship. At this time he had a consensual relationship with a then-graduate student. When a university policy on faculty-student relationships was adopted Cass was denied the appointment as Chair of the graduate program of the Department of Economics because of this relationship. As the graduate student in question graduated before the planned appointment of Cass as Chair of the department, the timeline of the administrative action rendered the initial objection moot. Beth Hayes/David Cass Prize In 1994, David Cass was instrumental in establishing the Beth Hayes Prize for Graduate Research Accomplishment at the University of Pennsylvania. The prize was created in honor and memory of Dr. Hayes, one of his former graduate students whom he describes in his essay \\"On Women.\\" In its original form, the prize was awarded biennially to the woman in the economics graduate program who had produced the most significant piece of original research in the preceding two years. The award was later modified with Cass's approval to include eligibility for male students. Following his death, the University renamed the award as The Beth Hayes/David Cass Prize for Graduate Research Accomplishment in Economics.

For 1961, the name was applied to low-end full-sized vehicles; for 1962 and 1963, the name was applied to Mercury's mid-sized sedans, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the Space Race, before being discontinued. Introduced while Mercury as a marque was in flux, and never a solid marketplace performer in consumer sales, the Meteor remains more a side note than a well known Mercury product. Meteor (Ford of Canada brand) 1954 Meteor Niagara Meteor was first used by Ford of Canada as the brand name for a distinct line of models introduced in 1949. The standalone Meteor brand name used then-contemporary Ford models, trimmed specifically for the Canadian market with unique grilles, taillights and other trim to marginally differentiate them from the Ford vehicles. This was done to give Canadian Lincoln-Mercury dealerships a product to sell in the low-price field, similar to Ford of Canada dealerships offering the Monarch line of lower-price vehicles which were actually another variation of Ford models with unique trim and model names. This was typical practice in the Canadian market (compared to that of the United States), where smaller towns might have only a Ford dealer or a Lincoln-Mercury dealer, but often not both. The introduction of Meteor also gave Lincoln-Mercury a direct competitor to the GM Pontiac brand in Canada.1968 Meteor Rideau 500 two-door hardtop. Although this car bears close resemblance to the U.S. market Monterey, it is actually based on the Ford Galaxie 500. From 1961 to 1963, the Meteor brand was temporarily discontinued, as the Mercury division used the Meteor name for a midsize car based on the Ford Fairlane. In addition, in both the United States and Canada, the Mercury division was shifted downward in price. In 1964, Lincoln-Mercury reintroduced the Meteor brand, replacing the Mercury Monterey in Canada. In contrast to previous versions, new Meteors used Mercury bodies, distinguished by the use of Ford interior trim. After 1976, the separate Meteor model lines were discontinued,Odin, L.C.

ASIN: B01HE91Y4K. with the nameplate becoming a low-cost trim of the Mercury Marquis in Canada through the 1981 model year. Background In the mid-1950s, Ford executives were convinced by Ernest Breech that, in order to compete with General Motors, the automaker had to meet each sales segment with a unique product. The plan affected Mercury by calling for the marque's first completely new platform and body design since World War II in order to differentiate it from Fords, beginning with the 1957 model year. Historically, Mercury was usually considered a \\"lower-medium-priced\\" car, most often compared to Pontiac and Dodge. Under Breech's plan Mercury would move upmarket and compete more directly with Buick, Oldsmobile, Chrysler and DeSoto and the Edsel would take over Mercury's previous role as the lower-medium-priced car and compete more directly with Pontiac and Dodge. While Breech‚Äôs plan could have succeeded in the early 1950s, by the late 1950s the bottom was beginning to drop out of the middle price car market; the 1958 recession effectively rendered Breech‚Äôs plan obsolete. Sales of Ford‚Äôs Edsel marque were a complete disaster. Sales of Mercury products failed to reach expected levels, leading to cost cutting decisions beginning in the 1961 model year. Had Robert S. McNamara, then head of the Ford division, had his way, Lincoln, Edsel and Mercury would have been eliminated. Instead, a compromise was made, and beginning in 1961 Ford and Mercury used the basic Ford body shells, and relied upon unique trim elements to differentiate the marques one from another. Edsel, meanwhile, was discontinued after a short run of 1960 models; what emerged as the 1961 Mercury Meteor was initially envisioned as the 1961 Edsel. Mercury product planning underwent another shift with the departure of fiscal conservative McNamara from Ford. What had been McNamara‚Äôs attempts to remake Mercury as a senior Ford were discarded, and instead, for 1965, Mercury was marketed as being \\"built in the Lincoln tradition\\". The first step towards this goal was the elimination of the compact-bodied Comet. Although Mercury had no mid-sized car for the 1964 and 1965 model years, the Comet continued to sell well during this time. Because the Comet name had better recognition than Meteor, the Comet name was transferred to Mercury's mid-sized car based on the Ford Fairlane beginning with the 1966 model year, in effect finally replacing the Meteor model and name that had last been built and used in 1963. For 1964, the Meteor name returned on a series of full-size models in the Canadian market, much as had been the case until 1961. First Generation (1961) The first step taken to make Mercury more cost effective within Ford, was to shed its higher priced Montclair and Park Lane models. The Monterey, previously the entry-level full-sized Mercury offering and priced slightly higher for the 1961 model year than comparable 1960 models, became the new top-of-the-line model. It was joined by the new, lower-priced Meteor 600 and Meteor 800. The Meteor 600 and Meteor 800 were, respectively, the evolution of the Medalist and Custom models last offered in 1956, as well as replacements for the discontinued Edsel. All full-sized 1961 Mercurys rode on a 120‚Äù wheelbase. For 1961, the Meteor was a full-sized model, differentiated from the Monterey through its trim and taillights. Meteor 600 taillights were oblong, while the Meteor 800 and upmarket Monterey used six circular tail lights, three on each side. Meteor 600s, available only as two- and four-door sedans, featured chrome spears from the taillights to the front wheels. Meteor 800s, available in two- and four-door sedan and hardtop body styles, featured the spear and three chrome bars on the front fenders, chrome fender fin trim, rocker panel trim and back-up lights. The Commuter four-door station wagon was trimmed comparably to the Meteors, while the Colony Park with simulated woodgrain trim on the side-panels was outfitted comparably to the Monterey. The standard engine in the Meteor and Commuter was a 223 cubic inch displacement inline six-cylinder with a single-barrel carburetor that generated at 4000 rpm. Optional engines included a 292 cubic inch V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor generating at 4200 rpm (standard on the Monterey and Colony Park), as well as a 352 cubic inch Marauder V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor generating , a 390 cubic inch Marauder V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor generating , and a 390 cubic inch Marauder V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor generating . The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with overdrive available as an option. Merc-O-Matic and Multi-Drive automatic transmissions were available as options. Second generation (1962-1963) For 1962, Mercury marketing decided that the Monterey nameplate had better consumer recognition than the Meteor moniker as far as full-sized vehicles were concerned (despite the fact that the Meteor outsold the Monterey), and instead assigned the Meteor name to a new line of mid-sized cars based on the Ford Fairlane which, in turn, was based on a long-wheelbase version of the Ford Falcon chassis. This smaller, mid-sized Meteor filled the product gap between the full-sized Monterey and the compact, Ford Falcon-based Mercury Comet. Riding the Fairlane‚Äôs 116.5 inch wheelbase, the 1962 Meteors wore unique rear quarter panels that mimicked the Monterey's jet-pod tail lights. The base Meteor and better-trimmed Meteor Custom were available as two- and four-door sedans. The Meteor S-33 was a specially appointed two-door sedan featuring premium exterior trim and interior amenities including bucket seats, and a center console. Its styling and features were similar to the Fairlane 500 Sports Coupe. For 1963, Meteors received a trim update and the addition of two body styles, a four-door station wagon and a two-door hardtop coup√©. The four-door station wagon was added to both the Meteor and Meteor Custom series. In the Meteor Custom series the station wagon was referred to as the Mercury Country Cruise and featured simulated wood-grain trim on the exterior. The hardtop coupe was added to the Meteor Custom and Meteor S-33 series. The hardtop coup√© replaced the two-door sedan in the Meteor S-33 series, as had the Fairlane Sports Coupe. The base Meteor engine was a 170 cubic inch, inline six-cylinder engine with a one- barrel carburetor at 4000 rpm. Optional engines included a 221 cubic inch V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor that generated and a 260 cubic inch V-8 with a two-barrel carburetor that generated . A three-speed manual transmission was standard. Overdrive and Merc-O-Matic automatic transmissions were options. A four-speed manual transmission became an option for 1963. Sales of the mid- sized Mercury Meteor were less than expected and the model was discontinued at the end of the 1963 model year.

Princess Er√©ndira of the Pur√©pecha was the princess of the Pur√©pecha from about 1503‚Äì1519. Life Er√©ndira was 16‚Äì17 when the Spanish came to Mexico. The Tarascan state's cazonci (monarch), Tangaxuan II, had given up his kingdom and people to the Spanish after he saw the downfall of the Aztec Empire to the Spanish. The story of princess Er√©ndira's subsequent role as a heroine is based on tradition and may or may not reflect actual events, since there are no contemporary records of her existence. According to the folk legend she led a war on the Spanish. Setting up base on a hill, she attacked the arriving Spaniards. She is said to have killed a Spanish horseman and stole his horse, later using it to train others in horsemanship. During one battle, some Spanish warriors found and murdered Er√©ndira's father in his sleep. Er√©ndira heard of his death and went to see him. According to the tradition, this was when the Pur√©pecha began to lose the war. There are many theories as to what happened to her. Some of which include her suicide by drowning, her leaving to train others for war and that she killed herself for falling in love with a Spanish monk.

Some of the more significant radio telescopes on site are a dish (oldest telescope on site), a dish featuring a special waveguide receiver and a dish (largest telescope on site). The site was part of the ECHELON communications network operated by the United States and its allies to intercept and process electronic telecommunications. The network operates many sites around the world including Waihopai Valley in New Zealand, Menwith Hill in the United Kingdom and Yakima, Washington. Sugar Grove is located in an officially designated National Radio Quiet Zone that covers in West Virginia and Virginia. The zone was established by Congress in 1958 to facilitate its mission and that of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory located away at Green Bank in Pocahontas County, West Virginia. On July 26, 2016 it was reported that the online auction for Sugar Grove Naval Station concluded on July 25 with a winning bid of $11.2 Million. This transaction later failed and bidding was reopened that September. In 2017, the second auction resulted in a $4 million purchase by an Alabama-based investment group with plans to convert the base into a healthcare facility for active-duty military, veterans, and their families. The dispute regarding the ownership of Sugar Grove purchased by Dr. Mike Murdock and A. J. Congdon from US GSA is supported by cashier's checks and bank account remitted by the auction winners and the former Sugar Grove Station owners and verified by GSA records.

History  The college is the sole provider of post-16 education in the north of Sheffield, following the abolition of traditional sixth-forms in 1988. The college was founded in 1989, following the merger of various colleges. In May 1995, the college was described as being the biggest in Britain. In 2003, the college launched a new 'federal structure', a reorganisation that 'sought to create a greater voice for students and a better organisational structure for its workforce'. In 2014, the now-closed Norton campus served as a filming location for the television series This Is England '90.  Courses  The college offers a variety of courses, from A-Levels to BTEC qualifications. In September 2012, more than 200 taxi drivers completed the first course of its kind designed to train prospective drivers in customer service skills. In October 2012, the college launched an online Human Trafficking Uncovered course, the first of its kind designed for those working in the public, private and voluntary sectors. In December 2014, singer JB Gill was recruited by the college as the public face of a two-year vocational performing arts course. The course was part of a portfolio of courses to help address a skills shortage in the creative industries. In September 2012, the closure of a press photographers' course raised concerns about the future of regional newspaper staff photography. The course had been running uninterrupted at Norton College since 1979. Campuses The college has main campuses at City, Hillsborough, Olive Grove and Peaks. = City = The rebuilt City College (2012) In 2010, Sheffield City College underwent a ¬£60 million rebuild programme to create an environmentally-friendly, single-site campus. The site provides vocational subjects including areas such as hair and beauty, catering, business and construction. The building features three roof mounted 15 metre tall wind turbines. Energy from the turbines is fed back into a distribution system for the college's tower block. The college also has solar panels and rainwater recycling facilities. In August 2017, the campus was temporarily evacuated and closed due to a faulty fire alarm system. = Hillsborough = New Hillsborough campus (2008) In June 2001, the college announced plans to replace two of its centres, based at Parson Cross and in Loxley, with a single campus in Hillsborough that would serve 1,800 students across the north of Sheffield. The plans received criticism from some, suggesting that there was 'inequality in education in the city'. In November 2003, construction began on the ¬£27 million campus, with the building completed in 2005. The site includes sports facilities, 14 art and design studios and 12 ICT workshops. It was proposed that the former Loxley site be replaced with up to 74 homes, but the proposals had encountered difficulty after the college had been unable to convince the local authority that the homes were appropriate for the area. In August 2007, plans for 79 houses and 29 apartments were judged to 'fall short' in terms of design, layout and appearance. Following the closure of the Norton campus, all courses were relocated to the Hillsborough campus in September 2015. The campus was one of the oldest Sheffield College site, with parts dating back to the 1950s. The courses were relocated to a new ¬£8.8 million centre and the former site was proposed to be redeveloped into a supermarket.  University Technical College (UTC)  The college has led two projects that have seen the creation of two university technical colleges (UTC) in Sheffield. The first, opened in September 2013, specialises in technical studies and offers 250 pupils training in the engineering and digital sectors. The scheme had been approved in August 2012 and construction began in September 2012. The project was said to have cost ¬£8.5 million. The college building was nominated for the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA) regional award in April 2015, after the building had been remodelled and refurbished with an aim to retain features of the original structure, which was built in 1902. A second, produced in partnership with Sheffield Hallam University, saw the unveiling of a ¬£10 million college in September 2016, based on the site of the former Don Valley Stadium. The UTC specialises in sports science, healthcare and well being and had been approved by Sheffield City Council in September 2015. The college employs 56 people and serves 600 pupils aged between 14 and 19. The plan had initially been rejected by the British Government in January 2014 but was eventually approved in August 2014 after the bid was resubmitted.  Results  In August 2009, the college reported a pass rate of 96.9 per cent, with those achieving A to B grades at 34.4 per cent. In August 2016, the college reported a 93 per cent A-Level pass rate, with 23 per cent of grades at A* to B. This was down from the scores of 2015, which were 94 and 23 per cent respectively. In February 2016, Ofsted marked the college as 'requiring improvement', following an inspection. Inspectors had found failings in leadership, teaching, attainment, personal development and both 16 to 19 and adult education programmes. In August 2017, the National Student Survey (NSS) awarded the college with an 86 per cent satisfaction rate, a score higher than the national average of 84 per cent. Students' Union The Sheffield College Students' Union (SCSU) reportedly represents around 25,000 students at the college every year. Every student automatically becomes a member of the union upon enrollment. Notable alumni *Richard Caborn *David Blunkett *George W.

Leonard. It stars Judy Garland, Van Johnson, and S.Z. Sakall. The film is a musical adaptation of the 1940 film, The Shop Around the Corner, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, and starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, and written by Mikl√≥s L√°szl√≥ based on his 1937 play Parfumerie. For the film, the locale has been changed from 1930s Budapest to turn-of-the- century Chicago, but the plot remains the same.  Plot  Veronica Fisher (Judy Garland) enters Oberkugen's music shop, looking for work. Although Otto Oberkugen (S. Z. Sakall) is reluctant to take on more staff, she wins a job by persuading a wealthy matron, through her singing and musical expertise, to buy a harp at almost $25 over Oberkugen's list price. Neither she nor Andrew Larkin (Van Johnson), the shop's senior salesman, suspects that they are each other's anonymous pen pal. They bicker constantly at work despite becoming increasingly attracted to each other. Cast * Judy Garland as Veronica Fisher * Van Johnson as Andrew Larkin * S. Z.

Director Robert Leonard originally hired Buster Keaton as a gag- writer to help him devise a way for a violin to get broken that would be both comic and plausible. Keaton came up with an elaborate stunt that would achieve the desired result; however, Leonard realized Keaton was the only one who could execute it properly, so he cast him in the film. Keaton also devised the sequence in which Johnson inadvertently wrecks Garland's hat and coached Johnson intensively in how to perform the scene. This was the first MGM film that Keaton appeared in after having been fired from the studio in 1933. The picture was filmed between November 1948 and January 1949. Garland's three- year-old daughter, Liza Minnelli, makes her film debut, walking with her mother and Van Johnson in the film's closing shot. The song \\"Last Night When We Were Young\\" was written in the 1930s by Harold Arlen and E. Y. \\"Yip\\" Harburg for the Metropolitan Opera star Lawrence Tibbett. Garland loved it and wanted to include it in the film. It was recorded and filmed but when the picture was released, it was cut from the final print. The audio recording of \\"Last Night When We Were Young\\" was featured on several of Garland's MGM record albums and she also later recorded it for Capitol Records in the 1950s. The entire footage of the number was found in the MGM vaults and included in the PBS documentary American Masters: Judy Garland: By Myself in 2004.  Reception  The film was made during the height of the strained relationship between Garland and MGM. As a testament to Garland's strong popularity, it was a huge critical and commercial success. According to MGM records it earned $2,892,000 in the US and Canada and $642,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $601,000. According to Variety it earned $3.4 million in the US. The film was the second to last one that Garland made at MGM (with the final being Summer Stock). MGM terminated her contract - by mutual agreement - in September 1950.

The concept is an extension of the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu equilibrium and the base for the first consistent incomplete markets framework. The departure from the Arrow-Debreu framework are two-fold: (1) uncertainty is explicitly modelled through a tree structure (or equivalent filtration) rending passage of time and resolution of uncertainty explicit, (2) budget feasibility is no longer defined as affordability but through explicit trading of financial instruments. Financial instruments are used to allow insurance and inter-temporal wealth transfers across spot markets at each nodes of the tree. Economic agents face a sequence of budget sets, one at each date-state. Item (2) introduces the concept of incomplete markets, formulated in terms of net trade, the budget set is contained in a half space intersecting the positive cone of contingent goods at zero net trade only (this is called absence of arbitrage). This is because without transaction cost agents will demand an infinite amount of any trade promising positive consumption in some state and no negative net trade against that in any other good and state. This half space, containing the budget set and separating it from the free lunch cone, corresponds to a half line of positive prices. However potentially if not enough instruments are present, the full half space may not be spanned by trading the instruments and the budgets set may be strictly smaller. In such a configuration markets are said to be incomplete, and there are several ways to separate the budget set from the positive cone (sometimes called the free-lunch cone). This means that several price systems become admissible. At a Radner equilibrium like the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu equilibrium under uncertainty, perfect consensual foresight is used. It is what is called a rational expectation model.

While the exact definition is not immediately straightforward, intuitively the essential supremum of a function is the smallest value that is larger or equal than the function values everywhere when allowing for ignoring what the function does at a set of points of measure zero. For example, if one takes the function f(x) that is equal to zero everywhere except at x=0 where f(0)=1, then the supremum of the function equals one. However, its essential supremum is zero because we are allowed to ignore what the function does at the single point where f is peculiar. The essential infimum is defined in a similar way. Definition As is often the case in measure theoretic questions, the definition of essential supremum and infimum does not start by asking what a function f does at points x (i.e., the image of f), but rather by asking for the set of points x where f equals a specific value y (i.e., the preimage of y under f). Let f : X -> R be a real valued function defined on a set X. A real number a is called an upper bound for f if f(x) ‚â§ a for all x in X, i.e., if the set :f^{-1}(a, infty) = {xin X: f(x)>a} is empty. Let : U_f = {a in mathbb{R}: f^{-1}(a, infty) = varnothing} , be the set of upper bounds of f. Then the supremum of f is defined by : sup f=inf {U_f} , if the set of upper bounds U_f is nonempty, and sup f = + infty otherwise. Alternatively, if for some a in mathbb{R} we have f(x) le a for all x in X then sup f le a. Now assume in addition that (X,Sigma;mu) is a measure space and, for simplicity, assume that the function f is measurable. A number a is called an essential upper bound of f if the measurable set f^{-1}(a, infty) is a set of measure zero, i.e., if f(x)le a for almost all x in X. Let :U^{operatorname{ess}}_f = {a in mathbb{R}: mu(f^{-1}(a, infty)) = 0}, be the set of essential upper bounds. Then the essential supremum is defined similarly as : operatorname{ess} sup f=inf U^{mathrm{ess}}_f , if U^{operatorname{ess}}_f e varnothing, and operatorname{ess}sup f = + infty otherwise. Alternatively, if for some a in mathbb{R} we have f(x) le a for almost all x in X then operatorname{ess} sup f le a. Exactly in the same way one defines the essential infimum as the supremum of the essential lower bounds, that is, : operatorname{ess} inf f=sup {b in mathbb{R}: mu({x: f(x) < b}) = 0}, if the set of essential lower bounds is nonempty, and as -infty otherwise. Examples On the real line consider the Lebesgue measure and its corresponding œÉ-algebra Œ£. Define a function f by the formula : f(x)= begin{cases} 5, & text{if } x=1  -4, & text{if } x = -1  2, & text{otherwise. } end{cases} The supremum of this function (largest value) is 5, and the infimum (smallest value) is ‚àí4. However, the function takes these values only on the sets {1} and {‚àí1} respectively, which are of measure zero. Everywhere else, the function takes the value 2. Thus, the essential supremum and the essential infimum of this function are both 2. As another example, consider the function : f(x)= begin{cases} x^3, & text{if } xin mathbb Q  arctan x, & text{if } xin mathbb Rsmallsetminus mathbb Q  end{cases} where Q denotes the rational numbers. This function is unbounded both from above and from below, so its supremum and infimum are ‚àû and ‚àí‚àû respectively. However, from the point of view of the Lebesgue measure, the set of rational numbers is of measure zero; thus, what really matters is what happens in the complement of this set, where the function is given as arctan x. It follows that the essential supremum is /2 while the essential infimum is ‚àí/2. On the other hand, consider the function f(x) = x3 defined for all real x. Its essential supremum is +infty, and its essential infimum is -infty. Lastly, consider the function : f(x)= begin{cases} 1/x, & text{if } x e 0  0, & text{if } x = 0.  end{cases} Then for any textstyle a in mathbb R, we have textstyle mu({x in mathbb R : 1/x > a}) geq tfrac{1}{a} and so textstyle U_f = varnothing and operatorname{ess} sup f = + infty.

Born and raised in Denmark, of Pakistani descent, he is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. To date, he is the only person born in Denmark to play Test cricket. Career Khan, at the age of 17, is the youngest person ever to play for the Danish cricket team, the country of his birth. In his first full season at Kent County Cricket Club, in 2002, he claimed 63 wickets. He failed to regain his form for the next two seasons, taking a combined total of 31 wickets. In the seasons that followed, Khan performed better, taking 55 wickets in 2005 before recording 34 the season after, despite missing almost half of it through injury. In December 2006, Khan was awarded British citizenship, which made him eligible to be selected for England. It only took one month for the English selectors to recognise him, when they named him as part of a 14-man England 'A' squad to tour Bangladesh. Subsequently, he was named in the 30-man World Cup squad, although he was not selected in the final squad when it is halved to 15. At the end of February 2007, it was revealed that Khan had been ruled out for the entire 2007 season, after having surgery on his cruciate ligaments. However, following the 2008 season, Khan was named as one of the members of the \\"Development squad\\" of fringe players, to be sent to India as back-ups to the main England squad, because he had \\"impressed with his pace and swing\\". He gave away 16 runs in his first and only over during the Twenty20 Cup Semi-final, where Marcus Trescothick smashed four successive boundaries. Khan joined Sussex for the 2011 season replacing Corey Collymore On 20 March 2014, Sussex announced they had released Khan after his 2013 season was disrupted by injury. He captained Denmark in the 2016 ICC World Cricket League Division Four in Los Angeles, after team captain Michael Pedersen left the tournament to attend to a family emergency. International recognition In November 2008, Khan was called up (along with Sajid Mahmood) to act as cover for Stuart Broad and Andrew Flintoff during the One Day International series in India. He never actually joined up with the one-day squad due to the Mumbai terrorist attacks, which forced the cancellation of the rest of the series.

He was reprimanded by the match referee for excessive appealing. When it was announced that fast- bowler Ryan Sidebottom would be unable to play in the ODIs or T20s following the Test series because of a recurring injury, Khan was named as his replacement.

Magnus Heinason served William the Silent and his son Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange for 10 years as a privateer, fighting the Spanish in the Dutch Revolt. Magnus Heinason was given the trading rights to the Faroe Islands by King Frederick II of Denmark and Norway from 1559 to 1588. Later he received letters of marque to sink or capture pirate ships and English merchant ships. Magnus built the first fortifications in T√≥rshavn. Only one year later, he was captured and sent to Copenhagen on the orders of the Danish treasurer and statholder, Christoffer Walkendorf (1525‚Äì1601) who was ruling Denmark after the sudden death of Frederick II. Magnus Heinason was tried, and was beheaded 18th January 1589. His widow, Sofie von G√ºnsterberg, and his business partner Hans Lindenov (d. 1610) contested this act and brought the matter to an assembly of nobles (Herrendag) at the seaport of Kolding. Magnus Heinason's death sentence was declared void on 6th of August 1590 and posthumously he was rehabilitated. Valkendorff was suspended from his duties and was forced to pay 3,000 Reichsthaler to the heirs. Magnus Heinason's remains were exhumed and taken to √òrslev Kloster (√òrslevkloster) on Lindenov's estate where they lie under the floor of the monastery church until this day.

Vogt, M√ºlheim a.d. Ruhr, 2005, S. 134f. Family Heinason was the son of Heine Havreki (1514‚Äì1576), a Norwegian priest from Bergen who emigrated to the Faroe Islands and who helped introduce the Lutheran Reformation to the Faroe Islands, and Gyri Arnbj√∏rnsdatter, Havreki's second wife from a powerful and wealthy Norwegian clan. In his job as a priest in the Faroes, Heine Havreki traveled much by sea, to and from the islands. Magnus accompanied him on these journeys. Even as a little boy Magnus knew how to sail small boats and gained a lot of experience that would be useful later in life. As a grown man in his career as a seaman and a privateer he would carry out some of his most notorious acts in these same waters.Troels Lund: \\" Mogens Heines√∏n: Et Tidsbillede fra det 16de Aarhundrede\\" (Copenhagen: Gyldendal. 1911) page 27‚Äì30 Magnus Heinason was engaged three times and married twice. Magnus had a son with a Faroese lady Kollfina around 1560. Rasmus Magnussen (1560-1670) lived to the age of 110 years, and at the age of 103 he became the father of a son. In 1580 Magnus met a Norwegian noble lady Margrethe Axeldatter Gyntersberg or von G√ºntersberg (1565-1589), daughter of Norwegian nobleman Axel Gyntersberg (c. 1525‚Äì1588). They had a child Mogensbarn that died as child. They did not marry, because she accused him of rape. The noble family then demanded that he marry Margrethe's younger sister, Sophie Axeldatter Gynhterberg (1566-1607). They married in 1582 in Bergenhus, Bergen and had one daughter, Elsebeth Magnusdatter (1584-1645). She later married Anders Matsen «¢nes and lived at «¢nes in the Hardangerfjord in Norway.  Early Life  Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange ‚Äì portrait by Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt Frederick II of Denmark and Norway When Magnus was 17 or 18 years old his father was transferred to Norway. The family moved to Bergen. Here Magnus was able to live out his dream of becoming a seaman primarily due to family connections on his father's side. At a young age he was made captain of a trade ship on the route that his father had sailed for many years, namely the route from Bergen to the Faroe Islands. On his third trip he was attacked by pirates. What actually occurred is not known, but when he returned to Bergen, people ridiculed him for giving up without a fight. He was deeply upset by this incident and swore that he would take revenge. He left Norway and went to the Netherlands where he joined the Navy. Little is known about this part of Magnus‚Äô life. He returned about 10 years later with commendations from Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and his father William the Silent for bravery in combat at sea against the Spanish in the Dutch Revolt which eventually resulted in the liberation of the Dutch people from the Spanish crown.  Returning to Denmark  Magnus returned to Denmark with good recommendations from Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange - something that would be beneficial for him in later negotiations with the Danish King, Frederick II of Denmark and Norway. It is likely that Magnus had planned to move back to Bergen and take up his old job as captain on the trade route between Bergen and the Faroe Islands. This time however he was the proprietor of his own ship. The fact that his half-brother J√≥n Heinason was made L√∏gma√∞ur in 1571 during Magnus' stay in the Dutch navy was certainly an advantage for any new plans in this direction. If Magnus had planned to obtain the trade rights for this route or perhaps even a monopoly for the trading to and from the Faroe Islands, they were immediately dashed by the treasurer and statholder ( Danish: rentekammeret), Christoffer Valkendorff. Shortly before had he abolished the old tradition of granting exclusive trade rights to private merchants. In the meanwhile ships trading on and from the Islands did so under government auspices and regulations and paying respective fees. This state monopoly started in 1578. That was the year of Magnus‚Äô return home.  The monopoly  Christoffer Valkendorff Magnus went to the king to improve his position by trying to prove that he was worthy to take over the trade on the Faroe Islands. The king however was not pleased with the idea of giving up monopoly trade which he had just obtained for himself. In order to find some loophole Magnus used an excuse that some people owed him money on the Faroes, and he had to collect it. For this reason he bid the king to grant him a special travel pass. He requested one trip from Bergen to the Faroe Islands in order to get what belonged to him. The king couldn't see anything wrong in this plan being that Heinason was a man of word and honour. But before he gave him the free pass, he made Magnus promise not to trade goods, even if his debtors offered him goods instead of money. If he should come into possession of goods, he was to hand them over to the king. Magnus agreed to this. The king granted him free passage for this trip, and Magnus left Copenhagen. Upon returning home he tried to bend the stipulations for his journey a bit, but suddenly he had entirely different plans in mind. He met with several of the farmers and high standing people on the Faroes including his half brother J√≥gvan Heinason (1541‚Äì1602), high Judge of the Faroes ( L√∏gma√∞ur). He talked these leaders into a small type of rebellion against the new government monopoly. And Magnus was successful! The people on the islands proposed to the king that instead of the king leading the trade, a supervisor should keep the books and make sure everything was legal. If the king wouldn't agree to this proposal, the Faroese people at least wanted a man of their choice from the Islands to be in command of a ship of his own. He should be able travel back and forth between the Faeroe Islands and Bergen trading in timber and wheat - two commodities which had become scarce since the government had monopolized trade for itself. At the ting no names were mentioned, but it was clear whom the assembly members had in mind. The Faroese proposal was presented to the king in December 1578 in Koldinghus. The Faroese men who had traveled all the way to Kolding said that they wished to have a man called Magnus Heinason to be the commander of ships doing trade with their islands. The king did not want to make this decision himself; instead, he turned the matter over to his treasurer and statholder Christoffer Valkendorff. He was to decide what was in best interest for the king, since he was the one who had proposed to the king to begin a monopoly on the Faeroe Islands. While Valkendorff and the clerks were counting numbers, calculating and checking books, Magnus took advantage of the situation and became good friends with King Frederick II. Any way Valkendorff would turn it, any losses he predicted and any facts that he could state - nothing could come between Magnus and his new friend King Frederik II. The king granted Heinason the command of the ships and gave him the trade rights. Christoffer Valkendorff's plan of upholding a trade monopoly on the Faroese vanished in thin air. The Faroese now would send all goods that were produced in the Faroe Islands on ships owned by Magnus Heinason, and all goods needed on the Islands (timber, beer, wheat and the like) would be brought by Magnus‚Äô fleet.  Pirates raiding T√≥rshavn  In the summer of 1579 T√≥rshavn was raided by a Scottish pirate named Klerck. Magnus first heard of this when he landed in T√≥rshavn. The Scots had taken most of the king's taxes and also a lot of private goods that were stored in T√≥rshavn. Magnus himself had lost goods that were intended to be sold and then taxed by the king. Magnus left the Faroe Islands and went to Denmark to present this case to the king. He wanted the king to cover the loss of the goods, since Magnus had paid for them and the king would have received taxes for them. The king agreed to cover half the loss. Magnus was to take on the rest. Magnus was not pleased by this proposal. He requested that the king should allow him to arm his merchant ships with cannons so that he could fight the pirates or at least take them prisoner and then take them on shore for trial. Since he had served in war in the Dutch navy, and had fine recommendations from Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, King Frederick II conceded. In this context King Frederick mentioned the Oresund taxes which he was losing, when Dutch merchants sailed the northern route along the coast of Norway into the White Sea to trade with Russia, instead of taking the shorter route between Denmark and Sweden through Oresund. Hence Magnus got letters of marque to stop and confiscate any foreign ship that intended to travel north along the coast of Norway with one stipulation however: That Magnus should not attack any merchant or navy vessels of any nation, if they were travelling \\"rightfully\\".  Valkendorf's Rule  Christiansborg Palace Square To soften the king again offered Heinason now trying to find a passage to Greenland. This he did not. Christoffer Valkendorf was still looking to trap him, and in 1581 he was faced with accusations of fraud by trading and rape in Norway. As the situation became so threatening to Heinason that he fled to Holland and again went to the service of the Prince of Orange. Two years later he went back his former patron Frederick II, which set the bar over old accusations and let Magnus have the island of Egholm in Limfjord as a fief. But Christopher Valkendorf was not going to give up, and now he was using English, which accused Heinason illegal boarding of an English ship, while serving in the Netherlands. Magnus fled again, but was overtaken and arrested in Norway. While this was happening, the king died suddenly, and Valkendorf used the opportunity to carry out a rapid and irregular trial. Two days later, on 18 January 1589, was Heinason executed by beheading on Christiansborg Palace Square (Christiansborg Slotsplads) in Copenhagen. Valkendorf had finally got rid of his enemy.  Acquitted  √òrslev Kloster Under the influence of nobleman Hans Lindenov and the widow, Sofia, the case was taken up again the following year because of the irregular trial. Here Heinason was acquitted of all charges. The body was moved and got an honorable burial at √òrslev Kloster (√òrslevkloster). Christopher Valkendorf lost all his offices. Today he is regarded as a hero in the Faroe Islands. At J√¶gerspris Castle (J√¶gerspris Slot) on Zealand, there is a memorial to Heinason together with Ludvig Holberg, Snorri Sturluson and other famous and illustrious names from the Danish kingdom.

He appeared in many films including Christmas in Connecticut (1945), In the Good Old Summertime (1949), Lullaby of Broadway (1951), and Casablanca (1942), in which he played Carl, the head waiter. Chubby-jowled Sakall played numerous supporting roles in Hollywood musicals and comedies in the 1940s and 1950s. His rotund cuteness caused studio head Jack Warner to bestow on Sakall the nickname \\"Cuddles\\". Early life and career US Naturalization index record of SZ Sakall Ger≈ë Jen≈ë (later transcribed in English as Jacob Gero) was born in Budapest to a Jewish family. During his schooldays, he wrote sketches for Budapest vaudeville shows under the pen name Sz≈ëke Szak√°ll, meaning \\"blond beard\\", in reference to his own beard, grown to make him look older, which he affected when, at the age of 18, he turned to acting. He became a United States citizen under the name of Jacob Gero ([a]ka Sz≈ëke Szak√°ll) The actor became a star of the Hungarian stage and screen in the 1910s and 1920s. At the beginning of the 1920s, he moved to Vienna, where he appeared in Hermann Leopoldi's Kabarett Leopoldi-Wiesenthal. In the 1930s, he was, next to Hans Moser, the most significant representative of the Wiener Film, the Viennese light romantic comedy genre. He also appeared in Berlin. He appeared in Familientag im Hause Prellstein (1927), Ihre Majest√§t die Liebe (1929, which was remade in Hollywood as Her Majesty Love, with W.C. Fields in Sakall's role) and Two Hearts in Waltz Time (1930). For a brief period during this time, he ran his own production company. The war years When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Sakall was forced to return to Hungary. He was involved in over 40 movies in his native land. When Hungary joined the Axis in 1940, he left for Hollywood with his wife. Many of Sakall's close relatives were later murdered in Nazi concentration camps, including all three of his sisters and a niece, as well as his wife's brother and sister. Sakall began a Hollywood career that included \\"an endless succession of excitable theatrical impresarios, lovable European uncles and befuddled shopkeepers\\". His first American film role was in the comedy It's a Date (1940) with Deanna Durbin. The first big hit of his American career was Ball of Fire (1941) with Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. Later, he signed a contract with Warner Bros., where he had a number of other small roles, including one in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) with James Cagney. Later the same year, at the age of 59, he portrayed his best remembered character, Carl the head waiter in Casablanca (1942). Producer Hal B. Wallis signed Sakall for the role three weeks after filming had begun. When he was first offered the part, Sakall hated it and turned it down. Sakall finally agreed to take the role provided they gave him four weeks of work. The two sides eventually agreed on three weeks. He received $1,750 per week for a total of $5,250. He actually had more screen time than either Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet. Later career Sakall appeared in 30 further movies, including Christmas in Connecticut (1945), reuniting with Barbara Stanwyck. Sakall appeared in four films released in 1948: the drama Embraceable You, followed by April Showers, Michael Curtiz's Romance on the High Seas (Doris Day's film debut), and Whiplash. He was in four top movies in 1949. First Sakall played Felix Hofer in Doris Day's second film, My Dream Is Yours. Later that year, he supported June Haver and Ray Bolger in Look for the Silver Lining. Next, he played Otto Oberkugen in In the Good Old Summertime, with Judy Garland and Van Johnson. This was a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner (1940). Finally, Sakall was given the principal role of songwriter Fred Fisher in Oh, You Beautiful Doll, though top billing went to June Haver. Sakall appeared in nine more movies during the 1950s, two of them musicals with Doris Day, playing J. Maxwell Bloomhaus in Tea for Two (1950) and Adolph Hubbell in Lullaby of Broadway (1951). His other roles included: Poppa Schultz in the Errol Flynn western Montana (1950); Miklos Teretzky in the June Haver musical The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady (also 1950); Don Miguel in the Randolph Scott western Sugarfoot; Uncle Felix in the musical Painting the Clouds with Sunshine (1951) with Virginia Mayo, and one of the episodes in the movie It's a Big Country (also 1951) featuring Gene Kelly, Van Johnson, Gary Cooper, Janet Leigh, Fredric March and Ethel Barrymore. His last movie was The Student Prince (1954). Death Sakall died of a heart attack in Hollywood on 12 February 1955, shortly after filming The Student Prince, ten days after his 72nd birthday. He is buried in the Garden of Memory in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

History The plan was introduced by the Government of India in August 2004. It was then integrated into the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan program, to provide educational facilities for girls belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, minority communities and families below the poverty line in Educationally Backward Blocks.Revised Guidelines for Implementation of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBVs) Objective Gender disparities still persist in rural areas and among disadvantaged communities. Looking at enrolment trends, there remain significant gaps in the enrollment of girls at the elementary level as compared to boys, especially at the upper primary levels. The objective of KGBV is to ensure that quality education is feasible and accessible to the girls of disadvantaged groups of society by setting up residential schools with boarding facilities at elementary level. Eligibility The scheme was applicable since inception in 2004, in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) where the rural female literacy is below the national average (46.13%: Census 2001) and gender gap in literacy is more than the national average (21.59%: Census 2001). Among these blocks, schools may be set up in areas with: # concentration of tribal population, with low female literacy and/or many girls out of school; # concentration of SC, OBC and minority populations, with low female literacy and/or many girls out of school; # areas with low female literacy; or # areas with many small, scattered habitations that do not qualify for a school The criteria of eligible blocks has been revised with effect from 1 April 2008 to include the following: * An additional 316 Educationally backward blocks with rural female literacy below 30%; and * 94 Towns/cities having minority concentration (as per the list identified by Ministry of Minority Affairs) with female literacy rate below the national average (53.67%: Census 2001). Coverage Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, Nayagaon, Bihar, sonpur The scheme has been implemented in 28 states and union territories: Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidhayalaya (KGBV) Scheme detail 2578 KGBVs were sanctioned by the Government of India.2013 Of these, 427 KGBVs have been sanctioned in Muslim concentration blocks, 612 in ST blocks, 688 in SC blocks. A total of 750 residential schools have been opened in educational backward blocks. 75% enrollment is reserved for girls from SC, ST, OBC and Minority communities and the other 25% to girls from families below the poverty line.

Wee joined the board of directors of the United Chinese Bank (now the United Overseas Bank) in 1958. He was appointed managing director of the bank two years later, and when his father Wee Kheng Chiang, founder of United Chinese Bank, retired in 1974, Wee succeeded him as chairman. His son Wee Ee Chong succeeded him as chief executive officer of UOB.Bio of Wee Cho Yaw , National Library Board of Singapore. Early life His mother was the second wife of Wee Kheng Chiang, businessman in operating in Sarawak who was a Hokkien from Kinmen island. In 1937, Wee and his family fled to Kuching in Borneo to escape the Sino-Japanese War. He lived with the family of his father's first wife for about a year before moving to Singapore, where he attended Gong Shang Primary School and The Chinese High School. His education was disrupted by the Japanese invasion of Singapore and Malaya, and Wee spent most of the Japanese Occupation with his family in Karimun in Indonesia. After the Japanese Occupation, Wee returned to Singapore and attended Chung Cheng High School. There he was involved in anti-colonial politics, and was investigated by the British authorities before his father then pulled him out of school. United Overseas Bank =Early career= In 1949, Wee started work at Kheng Leong, a business owned by his family that traded commodities such as rubber, pepper and sago flour. He stayed close to his father and learned the ways of business, taking on his millionaire father's wide range of contacts and connections. In 1958, Wee became the youngest director on the board of United Chinese Bank (UCB), which his father had founded in 1935. He then spent several months attached to a British bank in London to study its operations, before returning to work in UCB. =United Chinese Bank= In 1960, Wee Kheng Chiang stepped down as managing director of UCB (while remaining as chairman), and Wee took over the post from 1 July. The bank had previously dealt only with local businesses, but Wee moved the bank into foreign exchange and international trade financing. In 1964 UCB applied to open a branch in Hong Kong, and was renamed United Overseas Bank (UOB) from January 1965 to avoid a clash of names with an existing bank there. By this time, Wee had grown the bank's trade financing business more than a hundred- fold from before he took control of its operations. He had also raised its authorised capital and issued capital, grown its loans business and enlarged its assets nearly nine-fold. =Growth of UOB= Under Wee's direction, UOB expanded its branch network in Singapore and internationally, and further diversified into the finance business, property, insurance, realty, trustee and executor services, lease financing and merchant banking. The bank went public in 1970, and Wee was appointed vice-chairman a year later. In June 1971, UOB acquired 49.8% of the Chung Khiaw Bank, and Wee made the newspaper headlines for sealing the deal for a bank that at the time had a larger asset base and a larger network of branches. The S$22 million deal saw UOB beat more than six rivals to the deal and doubled UOB's size, creating the second largest banking group in Singapore and Malaysia. Wee later named the Chung Khiaw deal as one of his most important, as it marked UOB's take-off into the wider Asian market. In 1972, UOB was listed on the Hong Kong exchange and acquired Lee Wah Bank. Two years later, when his father retired as chairman of UOB, Wee was his successor. By the end of the 1970s, Wee was also chairman of Haw Par Brothers International and the Chinese newspaper Sin Chew Jit Poh, and sat on the boards of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), Sime Darby and Straits Steamship Company. The UOB group continued to grow in the 1980s, acquiring Far Eastern Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Wee took UOB into stockbroking, fund management and futures trading, and acquired property including hotels and shopping malls. The Business Times named Wee Singapore's Businessman of the Year for 1990 and again in 2001, and the ASEAN Business Forum named him its ASEAN Businessman of the Year in 1995. While a critic of the government's plan to liberalise Singapore's banking sector and allow foreign banks more market access in the 1990s, Wee restructured UOB's operations to meet the increased competition and to continue the bank's expansion in the region. In June 2001, UOB acquired the Overseas Union Bank (OUB) in a S$10 billion cash-and-shares deal. Wee was credited with a surer grasp of local business culture that allowed him to edge out the government- linked DBS, which also sought to acquire OUB. A day after DBS's unsolicited bid for OUB, Wee visited OUB founder Lien Ying Chow and was able to convince the Lien family to sell their stakes to UOB. Wee later said in an interview that he would have bid for OUB regardless of Lien's response, as the acquisition was vital to the survival of UOB. =Challenges and succession= In the mid-2000s, Wee faced a challenge to maintain his family's control over various companies in the UOB group amid a restructuring of the companies‚Äô interlocking shareholdings. This situation arose after the government mandated that banks would have to reduce their shareholdings in non-core businesses to stipulated levels. As companies such as United Overseas Land (UOL), Overseas Union Enterprise (OUE), United Industrial Corporation (UIC) and Haw Par Corporation held stakes in UOB and vice versa, the loss of any one would weaken the Wee family's control of the group and even the core business of UOB. Wee however managed to fend off a bid for UOL from government investment company Temasek Holdings as well as maintain control of UIC, after Filipino billionaire John Gokongwei‚Äôs failed takeover attempt. In November 2006, Wee received the inaugural Credit Suisse-Ernst & Young Lifetime Achievement Award for his pioneering work in Singapore's financial industry. A newspaper report then named him the best paid local banking executive, with a remuneration of between S$9 million and S$9.25 million in 2006. At UOB's 65th annual meeting in April 2007, Wee stepped down as the bank's chief executive officer and was succeeded by his eldest son Ee Cheong. He remained as chairman of UOB, which he had grown into Singapore's largest bank by market capitalisation with more than 500 branches and offices in 18 countries. Affiliations In 1969, Wee was appointed to the Economic Development Board and the Currency Board, and as chairman of the Singapore Science Centre board the following year. He was also elected as the first president of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce (later Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI)) in 1971 and served for two separate terms. He is honorary president at SCCCI. In 1972, he was head and spokesman of the ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Wee also headed the Hokkien Huay Kuan (clan association) from 1972 to 2010, and was founding president of the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA), an umbrella group for 190 associations, from 1985 to 2010. Wee was also a prime mover in the formation of the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) in 1992 and became chairman of its board of trustees. Recognition In 1971, the Singapore government awarded him the Bintang Masyarakat Bakti (Public Service Star), and he was named Singapore Businessman of the Year in 1990 and 2001. In 2006, for his contributions to the banking sector, he was presented with the inaugural Credit Suisse-Ernst & Young Lifetime Achievement Award. Wee received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Singapore in July 2008. In 2011, Forbes listed him as Singapore's wealthiest individual with a net worth of S$4.2 billion. Philanthropy Wee had been appointed chairman of the Nanyang University council in 1970, and he led efforts to modernise the university by updating its curriculum and establishing English as its medium of instruction. After the government merged Nanyang with the University of Singapore in 1980, Wee was appointed to the council of the newly formed National University of Singapore. In 2004, he became pro-chancellor of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In February 2009, the Wee Foundation was set up with an initial S$30 million endowment from the Wee family. The charitable foundation focuses on education and welfare for the under-privileged, and also promotes the Chinese language and culture as well as social integration. In August 2011, Wee received the Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang (Distinguished Service Order) in recognition of his work with the SFCCA and as pro-chancellor of NTU. =Education= Wee is the chairman of the joint School Management Committee for Chung Cheng High School (Main), Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) and Nanyang Junior College.

Controlled by No. 82 Wing, it is equipped with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed under the Australian Flying Corps in 1916 and saw action in the Sinai and Palestine Campaigns during World War I. It flew obsolete Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s, B.E.12s, Martinsyde G.100s and G.102s, as well as Airco DH.6s, Bristol Scouts and Nieuport 17s, before re-equipping with the R.E.8 in October 1917 and finally the Bristol Fighter in December. Its commanding officer in 1917‚Äì18 was Major Richard Williams, later known as the \\"Father of the RAAF\\". Disbanded in 1919, No. 1 Squadron was re-formed on paper as part of the RAAF in 1922, and re-established as an operational unit three years later. During World War II, the squadron flew Lockheed Hudson bombers in the Malayan and Dutch East Indies campaigns, suffering severe losses before being reduced to cadre in 1942. It was re-formed with Bristol Beauforts the following year, and re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquitos in 1945 for further operations in the Dutch East Indies. Reduced to cadre once more after the war ended, No. 1 Squadron was re-established at Amberley in 1948 as an Avro Lincoln heavy bomber unit. From 1950 to 1958 it was based in Singapore, flying missions during the Malayan Emergency, where it bore the brunt of the Commonwealth air campaign against communist guerillas. When it returned to Australia it re- equipped with English Electric Canberra jet bombers. It operated McDonald Douglas F-4E Phantom IIs leased from the USAF from 1970 to 1973, as a stop-gap pending delivery of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber. The F-111 remained in service for 37 years until replaced by the Super Hornet in 2010. In 2014‚Äì15, and again in 2017, a detachment of Super Hornets was deployed to the Middle East as part of Australia's contribution to the military intervention against ISIL. Role and equipment alt= A military jet on an airfield No. 1 Squadron is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No. 82 Wing, which is part of Air Combat Group. Its mission responsibilities include air-to-air and air-to-surface combat. The squadron is nicknamed the \\"Fighting First\\". The blazon of its crest is \\"the Australian Kookaburra in a diving position superimposed on the cross of Jerusalem\\", which symbolises the Victoria Cross-winning action of No. 1 Squadron pilot Frank McNamara in Palestine during World War I. The unit motto is Videmus Agamus (\\"We see and we strike\\"). The squadron operates Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet multi-role fighters, the first of which entered service in March 2010. Nicknamed the \\"Rhino\\", its missions include air superiority, fighter escort, land strike, maritime strike, close air support, and reconnaissance. The Super Hornet is larger than the \\"classic\\" McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet operated by the RAAF, carries more ordnance, and has a greater fuel capacity. It is fitted with a 20 mm cannon and can be armed with air-to-air and anti-shipping missiles, as well as a variety of air-to-ground bombs and missiles. Flown by a crew of two, a pilot and an air combat officer (ACO), it is capable of engaging targets in the air and on the surface simultaneously.McPhedran, Air Force, p. 356 It can be refuelled in flight by the RAAF's Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports.

This practice continued until January 1918, when the unit officially became known as No. 1 Squadron AFC. The relationship between airmen and ground crew was less formal than in British units; squadron members recalled that \\"The CO is the only one who is ever called 'sir and that officers did not demand \\"saluting and standing to attention and all that rot\\".Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 52 The unit received the first of several Martinsyde G.100 single-seat fighters to augment the B.E.2s on 16 October; although considered obsolete, the \\"Tinsyde\\" was substantially faster than the B.E.2, and armed with forward- firing machine guns.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 71 Shortly before the squadron took part in a bombing raid against Beersheba on 11 November, Lieutenant Lawrence Wackett managed to fix a machine gun to the top plane of one of the B.E.2s, using a mount he designed himself.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres, pp. 43‚Äì45 Each flight was also assigned a Bristol Scout beginning in December, but it too was obsolete and under-powered, and the squadron ceased operating the type within three months.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres, p. 47 Other older models issued to the unit included the Airco DH.6, Martinsyde G.102 and Nieuport 17.

This reorganisation temporarily denuded No. 1 Squadron of most of its aircraft, leaving only A Flight, with four Bulldogs and a Wapiti, in operation.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 187, 231‚Äì232No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), pp. 98‚Äì100 The Wapiti was transferred to No. 1 FTS in July, and by the end of the month the squadron's complement of aircraft stood at four Bulldogs and one Moth.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), p. 107 No. 1 Squadron began receiving new Demons in November 1936.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), p. 114 In January 1937, it relinquished its Bulldogs to No. 21 Squadron, which was to hold them until they could be transferred to the soon- to-be-formed No. 2 Squadron.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 231 By the end of February, No. 1 Squadron's strength was 12 Demons and one Moth, 11 officers and 108 airmen.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), p. 121 The unit was redesignated No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron in August 1937. Towards the end of the year, it was plagued by several Demon accidents, resulting in a series of inquiries and a review of RAAF procedures in 1938 by Marshal of the RAF Sir Edward Ellington; the so-called Ellington Report and its criticism of air safety standards led to the removal of Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams from his position as Chief of the Air Staff, which he had held since the formation of the Air Force.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 114‚Äì118, 344‚Äì348 No. 1 Squadron received the RAAF's first three CAC Wirraways on 10 July 1939.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), p. 162 As the likelihood of war increased, the squadron's role was altered to incorporate reconnaissance as well as bombing, resulting in the transfer out of all Demons and Wirraways and the transfer in from other units of nine Avro Ansons on 28‚Äì29 August 1939; at the end of the month its personnel comprised nine officers and 122 airmen.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), p. 163 =World War II= Lockheed Hudson of No. 1 Squadron, c. 1940 Following the outbreak of World War II, No. 1 Squadron's Ansons were tasked with maritime patrol and convoy escort duties.Eather, Flying Squadrons, pp. 19‚Äì21 In 1940, the squadron became the RAAF's inaugural Lockheed Hudson unit; it received its first Hudson on 30 March, and by the end of May had transferred out the last of its Ansons and was operating 11 of the new aircraft.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 141No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), pp. 175‚Äì179 Deployed to Malaya to conduct maritime reconnaissance, No. 1 Squadron arrived at Sembawang, Singapore, on 4 July 1940.RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, pp. 3‚Äì4 It relocated to RAF Kota Bharu, near the Malaya‚ÄìThailand border, in August 1941.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 198 Two days before the attack on Malaya, its Hudsons spotted the Japanese invasion fleet but, given uncertainty about the ships' destination and instructions to avoid offensive operations until attacks were made against friendly territory, Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham did not allow the convoy to be bombed.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 200‚Äì201Shores et al., Bloody Shambles Volume One, pp. 74‚Äì75 Shortly after midnight, local time, on the night of 7/8 December, the Japanese force started landing on the beaches at Kota Bharu, close to the airfield, and from about 02:00, No. 1 Squadron launched a series of assaults on the Japanese forces, becoming the first aircraft to make an attack in the Pacific War. The Hudsons sank a Japanese transport ship, the IJN Awazisan Maru, and damaged two more transports, the Ayatosan Maru and Sakura Maru, for the loss of two Hudsons, an hour before the attack on Pearl Harbor.Shores et al., Bloody Shambles Volume One, pp. 80‚Äì83 By the end of the day, Japanese ground forces had advanced to the outskirts of the airfield, forcing the squadron's remaining airworthy aircraft to be evacuated to Kuantan,Shores et al., Bloody Shambles Volume One, pp. 95‚Äì96Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 217 and from there back to Singapore.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 248‚Äì249 By Christmas Eve 1941, No. 1 Squadron had five serviceable aircraft. Together with No. 8 Squadron RAAF, also equipped with Hudsons, it was tasked with maritime patrols to the east of Singapore.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 282 On 26 January 1942, two of the squadron's Hudsons spotted a Japanese convoy heading for Endau, on the east coast of Malaya. It was decided to attack the convoy with all possible strength, including four Hudsons from No. 1 Squadron and five from No. 8 Squadron, together with obsolete Vickers Vildebeest and Fairey Albacore biplanes of Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons RAF, and with what little fighter escort could be found. The convoy was strongly defended by Japanese fighters, and although all nine Hudsons returned to Singapore, several were badly shot up. The rest of the strike force did not fare as well; 11 Vildebeests, two Albacores, two Hudsons (of No. 62 Squadron RAF) and three fighters were lost.Shores et al., Bloody Shambles Volume Two, pp. 18‚Äì38Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 344‚Äì346 By the end of the month, No. 1 Squadron had withdrawn to airfield P.2 on Sumatra, along with several other Commonwealth units including No. 8 Squadron. It continued to attack Japanese bases in Malaya and convoys in the Dutch East Indies, relocating to Semplak, Java, in mid-February. At Semplak it took over the Hudsons of No. 8 Squadron and No. 62 Squadron RAF, giving it a strength of 25 aircraft; at one stage it was to be renumbered as an RAF squadron, but this never occurred.Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 120‚Äì125 Heavily outnumbered by Japanese air units, which raided Allied bases with impunity, No. 1 Squadron suffered heavy losses and was ordered to withdraw its four remaining Hudsons to Australia on 2 March 1942, disbanding soon after. Although 120 of the squadron's personnel were evacuated from Java, 160 men including the commanding officer, Wing Commander Davis, were unable to escape and were taken prisoner by the Japanese; less than half survived captivity.Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 125‚Äì126 No. 1 Squadron was re-formed with Bristol Beauforts on 1 December 1943 at Menangle, New South Wales.RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, p. 4 By March 1944 it had deployed to Gould, Northern Territory, where it was controlled by No. 79 Wing under North-Western Area Command.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 215 Its strength at the beginning of the month was some 350 officers and men, and 19 Beauforts.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1925‚Äì1946), p. 235 The squadron commenced reconnaissance operations on 20 March, and undertook its first bombing mission on 4 April against Lautem, East Timor. It attacked other targets in Timor during May, losing two aircraft.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 228, 231 Having undertaken 82 sorties in July, the Beauforts concentrated on maritime reconnaissance from August, using air-to-surface radar during operations from Gould and Gove.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 244 After re-equipping with Mosquito fighter-bombers at Kingaroy, Queensland, in January 1945, the squadron deployed to Morotai in May and then Labuan Island in June‚ÄìJuly. Now part of No. 86 (Attack) Wing, it flew only a few missions before the end of the war, losing one Mosquito.Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 417‚Äì418 No. 1 Squadron returned to Australia in December 1945 and was disbanded at Narromine, New South Wales, on 7 August 1946. =Malayan Emergency= alt=Four-engined military aircraft in flight No. 1 Squadron was re-formed as a heavy bomber unit on 23 February 1948, when No. 12 Squadron was re-designated. Operating Avro Lincolns, it was based at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, where it formed part of No. 82 (Bomber) Wing. The wing's aircraft were serviced by No. 482 (Maintenance) Squadron.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, p. 66 From July 1950 to July 1958‚Äîfor the first two-and-a- half years under the auspices of No. 90 (Composite) Wing‚Äîit was based in Singapore, flying missions against communist guerrillas during the Malayan Emergency. Tasked by RAF Air Headquarters Malaya, the Lincolns generally conducted area bombing missions, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers, and often strafed targets with their machine guns and 20 mm cannon after dropping ordnance. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, as well as their firepower and heavy bomb load.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 244, 247‚Äì248 Not having to contend with anti-aircraft fire, they flew mainly by day, but No. 1 Squadron also operated by night, the only Commonwealth unit to do so. The squadron carried out its own day-to-day maintenance in Malaya; the Lincolns were rotated back to Australia for major work. Its original complement of six aircraft was increased to eight after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent withdrawal of the RAF's Lincolns to Bomber Command in Europe.Dennis; Grey, Emergency and Confrontation, pp. 37‚Äì38 The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in 1950‚Äì51 and 1954‚Äì55.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 61 It suffered no casualties during the campaign but two of its aircraft were written off: one that overshot the landing strip at Tengah in November 1951, and another that crashed into the sea off Johore after striking trees on takeoff in January 1957.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service, p. 67 Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No. 1 Squadron and one by English Electric Canberra jet bombers of No. 12 Squadron RAF on 21 February 1956, was considered the most successful of the more than 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops.Coulthard-Clark, The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles, p. 270 By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs‚Äî85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 71 Its service was recognised with the presentation of a Squadron Standard by the Commander-in-Chief Far East Air Force, Air Marshal The Earl of Brandon.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service, p. 63 Until 2014, the Malayan Emergency had marked the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations. =Jet era= alt=Side view of twin-jet, straight-winged aircraft parked on airfield No. 1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after returning to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium- to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 363‚Äì369 No. 1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959‚Äì60 and 1960‚Äì61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers.No. 1 Squadron, Operations Record Book (1961‚Äì1988), p. 5 The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 59 Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 380‚Äì384 In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No. 1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service, p. 104Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, pp. 41, 56 Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 42 One of No. 1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 55 Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 387‚Äì388 alt=Two-seat military jet fighter painted in camouflage livery with open canopies, parked at airfield No. 82 Wing accepted its first F-111Cs in June 1973.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 282 The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, ordered that the new aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within operational limits, to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 121 No. 1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No. 82 Wing's lead strike force, while No. 6 Squadron was primarily tasked with crew conversion training.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service, p. 160Eather, Flying Squadrons, p. 35 The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No. 482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons' joint flying program.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 123 In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s was transferred to the flying squadrons, which for the first time took direct control of their F-111s.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, p. 68Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 127 No. 482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate-level servicing, while major upgrades and complex maintenance were carried out by No. 3 Aircraft Depot.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, p. 160Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 195 These two organisations merged in 1992 to form No. 501 Wing, which handed over heavy maintenance of the F-111 to Boeing Australia in 2001.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 196, 222‚Äì223 Between 1977 and 1993, the RAAF lost seven F-111Cs in crashes.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 135 Three of the accidents involved aircraft flown by No. 1 Squadron: in August 1979, January 1986 and September 1993, the last two killing both crew members. In July 1996, No. 1 Squadron took responsibility for aerial reconnaissance using specially modified RF-111Cs previously operated by No. 6 Squadron.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 141‚Äì142 This gave No. 1 Squadron five mission types: land strike, maritime strike, close air support, long-range air defence, and reconnaissance. In May 1999 the unit was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency. alt=High front view of four swing-wing jet aircraft in flight Along with its revolutionary variable-sweep wings, the F-111 was equipped with terrain-following radar and an escape module that jettisoned the entire cockpit in an emergency, rather than individual ejection seats.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 45 Its top speed was Mach 2.5 and its combat radius allowed it to reach targets in Indonesia from bases in northern Australia.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 110Stephens, Going Solo, p. 58 Upon delivery in 1973 it was fitted with analogue avionics and could only drop unguided (\\"dumb\\") bombs. In its 37 years of service with the RAAF the type went through several upgrades, including the Pave Tack infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, and advanced digital avionics. Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, described the F-111 as \\"the region's pre- eminent strike aircraft\\" and the RAAF's most important acquisition.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 393‚Äì394 The closest they came to being used in anger, though, was during Australian-led INTERFET operations in East Timor commencing in September 1999. Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, to support the international forces in case of action by the Indonesian military, and remained there until December; six of No. 1 Squadron's aircraft and approximately 100 personnel were involved. From 20 September, when INTERFET forces began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained at a high level of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. As it happened, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by RF-111Cs from 5 November through 9 December.Wilson, Warden to Tanager, pp. 32‚Äì34 alt= Twin-finned military jet on an airfield, with a ground crewman in an orange vest in the foreground In 2007, the Australian government decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending the arrival of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 234‚Äì235 No. 1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet.McPhedran, Air Force Today, p. 352 Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model.McPhedran, Air Force, pp. 356‚Äì357 No. 1 Squadron re-equipped between 26 March 2010 and 21 October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8 December 2011. The multi-role Super Hornet allowed No. 1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained full operational capability with the Super Hornet in December 2012. On 14 September 2014, the Federal government committed to deploying up to eight Super Hornets of No. 1 Squadron to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as part of the Australian Air Task Group joining the coalition against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces in Iraq. Aircraft from the squadron conducted their first mission over Iraq on 5 October, and their first strike four days later. According to the Department of Defence, as of 20 December 2014 the Super Hornets had flown over 180 sorties, dropped 113 weapons, and destroyed 36 ISIL targets, damaging another six. In March 2015, having flown almost 3,000 hours in over 400 missions, the detachment was replaced by six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron. A detachment of No. 1 Squadron was again to deployed to Al Minhad as part of the Australian Air Task Group in May 2017, replacing the legacy Hornets of No. 77 Squadron deployed prior. The Super Hornets flew the last strike mission of their rotation, and the last of 2,700 sorties by the Air Task Group Hornets, on 14 January 2018. In April, No. 1 Squadron was awarded the 2017 Gloucester Cup. Future In May 2013, the Federal government announced plans to purchase 12 Boeing EA-18G Growlers to supplement the Super Hornet fleet. No. 6 Squadron is expected to begin taking delivery of the Growlers in 2017, at which point its Super Hornets will be transferred to No. 1 Squadron. In April 2014, the government announced the purchase of 58 F-35s in addition to 14 already ordered, for the express purpose of replacing the 71 \\"classic\\" Hornets of Nos. 3, 75 and 77 Squadrons and No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit. A government decision on whether to purchase a further 28 F-35s, to be based at Amberley, will depend on how long the Super Hornets are to be retained. According to Australian Aviation, continuing delays to the F-35 program have increased the likelihood that the Super Hornets of Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons will, rather than being disposed of early as originally planned, continue to be operated by the RAAF for their full service life of over 20 years.

It is set in the Star Wars galaxy during the Clone Wars, 2.5 years after the Battle of Geonosis in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, and 19.5 years before the Battle of Yavin in Episode IV: A New Hope. Summary This book tells the tale of Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker trying to rescue an important Republic communications hub from the Separatist Forces, located on the barren planet of Praesitlyn. Halcyon, having previously failed an important mission, is sent as a trial in order for him to regain the Jedi Council's trust. As they had grown close during their time in the Jedi Temple, Halcyon chose Skywalker as his second-in-command against the wishes of the council, making the mission as much a trial for Anakin, as well. Even before reaching Praesitlyn, Nejaa confesses to Anakin of his violation of the Jedi code, that he has a wife and a son. In turn, Anakin relates about his own forbidden marriage to Padm√© Amidala, with both Jedi promising not to reveal their digressions to anyone. Skywalker and Halcyon lead the Republic reserve forces to reinforce Praesitlyn, and to recover the hostages within the Intergalactic Communications Center from C.I.S. occupation. The opposing C.I.S. forces are commanded by Muun Admiral Pors Tonith of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, under command himself from Asajj Ventress and Sith Lord Count Dooku. At this time, the Praesitlyn Defense Forces have been overcome, with Trooper Odie Subu and Lieutenant Erk H'Arman the only survivors. The only reason Praesitlyn has not been completely overrun by the C.I.S. is due to intervention by a rogue former Republic officer, Captain Slayke, and his troops, the badly-outnumbered Sons and Daughters of Freedom. Halcyon and Skywalker arrive just in time to relieve Slayke with all available troops, though the situation is still perilous. Anakin Skywalker is for the first time put in a commanding position, and, while acquitting himself well, clearly shows frustration and an impatience for combat. In addition to Skywalker's issues, the book also deals with attitudes towards clones, and their degree of humanity. We see a general stereotyping that clones are subdegree humans, with their personalities and abilities often not being trusted as much as those of other beings. This can be seen in actions of reconnaissance. where it is clear if Clone Commando CT-19/39 had not been disregarded, he would have been able to relay important information that would have saved hundreds of lives. Instead, only Sergeant Omin L'Loxx was relied upon, resulting in disaster. With such a disastrous failure, Anakin decides upon a desperate measure, by which he and a small attack group of two troop-transports fly directly to the ICC to rescue the hostages. Skywalker, in his element, destroys almost all droids in his path, leaving the troops behind him in awe, and with nothing to shoot at. Reaching the hostages, Anakin is shocked as a woman reminds him so much of his mother. As she is killed, we see Skywalker become an avenger, treading perilously close to the dark side of the Force. Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon, as well as Grand Master Yoda - and, indeed Darth Sidious - all feel the disturbances in the Force at this, though only one yet understands their meaning. Anakin's rampage only ends before murdering Pors Tonith, as he hears Qui-Gon Jinn's voice reaching him through the Force, telling him to use the Force for good, not destruction. Although Anakin initially brings himself out of his rage, it is only temporarily suppressed, to be brought out later once again. Though their objectives had been achieved, as well as Pors Tonith having been captured by Skywalker's actions, the Separatists' relief-fleet arrives under a cloaking device. In the battle, Anakin is again in his element, with Master Halcyon becoming more his wingmate than commander. Skywalker, although being called back, seemingly decides to sacrifice himself in order to destroy the enemy flagship. To Halcyon's horror, Anakin disappears in the blast of the Separatist relief-fleet's explosion. Later, however, in the midst of mourning Anakin and celebrating victory, Skywalker's craft returns, much to everyone's surprise. Anakin later explains his seeming resurrection, saying how he had installed a hyperdrive engine in his starfighter, enabling him to escape from the blast, with his split-second timing, stemming from his immense Force-sensitivity. On his return to Coruscant, the Jedi Council, overbowed with exceptional reports of Anakin's performance, finally agree to grant him Knighthood in the order.

Uses The Apt test is most commonly used in cases of vaginal bleeding late during pregnancy (antepartum haemorrhage) to determine if the bleeding is from the mother or the fetus. * A positive test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin, and could be due to vasa previa. * A negative test indicates that the blood is of maternal origin. In practice, the Apt test may not be done when there is suspicion of vasa previa, because the time to fetal collapse with bleeding from vasa previa is often very short. The Apt test can also be used to detect the presence of fetal blood in the maternal circulation in cases of suspected fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Since the test is only a qualitative determination of the presence of fetal hemoglobin in maternal blood, the quantitative Kleihauer-Betke test is more commonly used. Finally, the Apt test can be used after birth (postpartum hemorrhage) if the newborn has bloody vomiting, bloody stool, or active bleeding from the nasogastric tube. A positive apt test would mean that the blood is either due to gastrointestinal or pulmonary bleeding from the neonate. A negative Apt test would indicate that the blood is of maternal origin, suggesting that the neonate swallowed or aspirated maternal blood, either during delivery or during breastfeeding (e.g., from breast fissures). Theory The test is based on differences between maternal and fetal hemoglobin. Maternal blood contains adult hemoglobin composed of two alpha and two beta subunits (aka hemoglobin A or HbA; i.e., normal adult hemoglobin). Fetal blood contains fetal hemoglobin composed of two alpha and two gamma subunits (aka hemoglobin F or HbF; i.e., normal fetal hemoglobin). This difference in composition gives the different types of hemoglobin different chemical properties (in addition to the higher affinity HbF has for dissolved blood oxygen over HbA, allowing baby to extract oxygen from the mother's blood). Fetal hemoglobin is resistant to alkali (basic) denaturation, whereas adult hemoglobin is susceptible to such denaturation. Therefore, exposing the blood specimen to sodium hydroxide (NaOH) will denature the adult but not the fetal hemoglobin. The fetal hemoglobin will appear as a pinkish color under the microscope while the adult hemoglobin will appear as a yellow- brownish color. Method The blood is mixed with a small amount of sterile water to cause hemolysis of the RBCs, yielding free hemoglobin. The sample is next centrifuged for several minutes. The pink hemoglobin-containing supernatant is then mixed with 1 mL of 1% NaOH for each 5 mL of supernatant. The color of the fluid is assessed after 2 minutes. Fetal hemoglobin will stay pink and adult hemoglobin will turn yellow-brown since adult hemoglobin is less stable and will convert to hematin which has a hydroxide ligand.

It is performed throughout Japan, though associations with the Tsugaru remain strong. Tsugaru-jamisen is considered the most recognized genre of shamisen music, and has enjoyed multiple periods of popularity in Japan. History While it is clear that the instrument originated from China through Okinawa in the 16th century CE, the specific developers of tsugaru-jamisen are not known with certainty, largely because written records of its development were not kept nor was it ever formally recognized by the Japanese government. What is known is that tsugaru-jamisen originated from a small peninsula due west of present-day Aomori Prefecture called Tsugaru. In addition, some researchers have conjectured on the style's origins based on available evidence. There is some consensus that the style was developed by homeless and blind individuals called bosama. One scholar, Daij≈ç Kazuo, proposed that the genre originated from a bosama named Nitab≈ç on the basis of interviews of musicians and their families. According to his research, Nitab≈ç acquired and modified a shamisen in 1877 for which he adopted a different playing style. Nitab≈ç rounded off the plectrum of the instrument such that it was shaped like a rice paddle. In addition, he adopted a playing style with the shamisen held upright, included the area around the bridge as the playing area, and incorporated beating and slapping the strings in contrast to exclusive use of the plectrum. However, other scholars, such as Gerald Groemer, argue that due to a lack of documentation, the account advanced by Kazuo may not be entirely accurate. Nitab≈ç had multiple blind students, such as Kinobo and Ch≈çsakubo, who contributed to the development of the style. Nitab≈ç's last student, Shirakawa Gunpachir≈ç, performed outside of the Tsugaru region as a part of a folk performance troupe. Gunpachir≈ç also performed in professional settings, such as in concert halls in Tokyo. As a result of his successes, tsugaru-jamisen became popular in the 1920s, but its popularity waned with the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War later in the decade. During 1955-1965, many performers of the genre moved to urban centers in Japan such as Tokyo. This migration was part of a larger movement due to a boom in the traditional arts in Japan. Tsugaru-jamisen enjoyed another bout of popularity when Gunpachir≈ç performed with enka star Michiya Mihashi at the Nihon Theater in Tokyo in 1959. As a result of this mass exposure to the genre, younger practitioners of the genre began to emerge. Takahashi Chikuzan, who was also a bosama, was also a highly regarded practitioner of the genre and began touring Japan in 1964. Composition The Yoshida Brothers performing in concert at Webster Hall in November 2012 Tsugaru-jamisen is played on a larger shamisen called futazao with a thicker neck and thicker strings than those used for most other styles. Tsugaru-shamisen is easy to recognize by its percussive quality (the plectrum striking the body of the instrument on each stroke) and the lilt of the rhythms performed. Unlike most other Japanese music, some Tsugaru-shamisen pieces are in triple time, though the three beats are not accentuated in the manner of Western music. Tsugaru-shamisen has a large and steadily growing repertory. Interviews with noted performers such as Takahashi Chikuzan and Yamada Chisato and recordings issued by stars of the past allow one to produce the following table. Most of the titles given below exist in two versions: in song form (a vocal line with shamisen and drum (taiko) accompaniment) and as a solo shamisen piece (see sixth group below). Recently, younger performers have been attempting to combine Tsugaru-shamisen playing styles or motives with jazz, rock, and other forms of more commercial music. With the exception of arrangements classified as shin min‚Äôy≈ç, these pieces are usually considered to be traditional. The Tsugaru-shamisen repertoire *A.

Gass≈ç or kyoku-awase (ensemble playing of multiple shamisen, occasionally supplemented by other instruments such as percussion, taish≈ç-goto, koto, etc.). Most often versions of ‚ÄúJonkara bushi;‚Äù sometimes other songs of groups B to E above; occasionally newly composed pieces or free improvisation on standard patterns. Playing method The Tsugaru-shamisen is characterized by many distinct phrases and styles. In acrobatic technique (kyokubiki), improvising is the feature. The player will often strike the strings and skin very hard and fast with the bachi. They use only left index and ring finger traditionally, and the scale is basically pentatonic (do re mi sol la). A technique unique to the Tsugaru-shamisen style in recent years is the tremolo played with the back of the bachi without hitting the skin. Discussion of the repertoire Group A presents songs that are only rarely heard today, though they were once the mainstay of the repertoire of itinerant, often blind, musician-beggars known as bosama. At the start of the 20th century, these kudoki were gradually displaced by shorter non-narrative songs. The bosama (and, in time, other performers) tended to concentrate their efforts on some five favorite songs (Group C). By the middle of the 20th century three songs (Group B) and their shamisen versions had become the core of the Tsugaru-shamisen repertoire, which they remain today. Indeed, \\"Jonkara bushi\\" -- in a version that the old bosama would probably not even recognize -- has today become virtually a symbol of the timeless ‚Äúspirit of Tsugaru.‚Äù The songs of group D -- though no less traditional than those of groups A, B, and C -- were not, it seems, a major part of the bosama repertoire. Instead, they tended to be sung by non-professionals, generally without shamisen accompaniment. But with the Tsugaru-shamisen ‚Äúboom‚Äù after World War II, these songs began to receive renewed attention. Shamisen accompaniments were composed or arranged by such performers as Takahashi Chikuzan (Takahashi 1976:142). Somewhat earlier there had been a nationwide movement to produce ‚Äúnew folk songs‚Äù (see Hughes 1985:144-54, 281-309; Kojima 1970), resulting in the songs listed in Group E. More recently still, solo shamisen versions of the songs of Group D have been arranged. Solo versions of the older songs have become the center of the repertoire, leading to the development of long solo improvisations (Group F) and ensemble playing (Group G). One of the most the interesting characteristics of the Tsugaru-shamisen repertoire is what might be termed its cumulative nature. As can be seen from the listing of songs in Group B, newer variants of songs tend to coexist alongside older versions, rather than replacing them. Although the older songs and their shamisen accompaniments or shamisen solo versions have no doubt themselves been somewhat transformed from what they were many decades ago (and they of course were never an entirely uniform to begin with), it remains certain that the ‚Äúold,‚Äù ‚Äúmiddle,‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù versions are differentiated not merely stylistically but also historically. Their structural differences contain, as it were, a congealed history.

(December 1, 1854 ‚Äì March 6, 1937) was an American zoologist, conservationist, taxidermist, and author. He served as the first director of the New York Zoological Park, known today as the Bronx Zoo, and he was a pioneer in the early wildlife conservation movement in the United States. Biography Hornaday was born in Avon, Indiana, and educated at Oskaloosa College, the Iowa State Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) and in Europe. Hornaday preparing a tiger for display. After serving as a taxidermist at Henry Augustus Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York, he spent 1.5 years, 1877‚Äì1878 in India and Ceylon collecting specimens. In May 1878 he reached southeast Asia and traveled in Malaya and Sarawak in Borneo. His travels inspired his first publication, Two Years in the Jungle (1885). In 1882 he was appointed chief taxidermist of the United States National Museum, a post he held until his resignation in 1890. In his position at the museum, Hornaday was tasked with inventorying the museum's specimen collection of American Buffalo, which was meager. He then undertook a census of bison by \\"writing to ranchers, hunters, army officers, and zookeepers across the American West and in Canada.\\" Based on firsthand accounts, Hornaday estimated that as recently as 1867 there were approximately 15 million wild bison in the American West. Through his census, he ascertained that those numbers had rapidly depleted. In a letter written to his superior at the Smithsonian, George Brown Goode, Hornaday reported that, \\"in the United States the extermination of all the large herds of buffalo is already an accomplished fact.\\" In 1886 Hornaday went out west, to the Musselshell River region of Montana, where the last surviving herds of wild American buffalo lived. He was tasked with collecting specimens from the region for the United States National Museum collections, so that future generations would know what the buffalo looked like, after their expected extinction. The buffalo that Hornaday mounted remained on exhibit until the 1950s, when the museum underwent an exhibit modernization program. The Smithsonian sent the specimens to Montana, where they were placed in storage. After many years of neglect, they were rediscovered, restored, and placed on display in 1996 at the Museum of the Northern Great Plains in Fort Benton, Montana. The decimation of the species that Hornaday witnessed had a profound effect on him, transforming him into a conservationist. In addition to the specimens for the collection, he acquired live specimens that he brought back to Washington, D.C., which formed the nucleus of the Department of Living Animals he created at the Smithsonian, the precursor to the National Zoological Park, which he helped establish a few years later in 1889. Hornaday served as the zoo's first director, but left soon thereafter after conflict with the head of the Smithsonian, Samuel Pierpont Langley. Bronx Zoo Director William Hornaday feeding a greater kudu in the New York Zoological Park in 1920. In 1896, the newly chartered New York Zoological Society (known today as the Wildlife Conservation Society) enticed Hornaday back to the zoo field by offering him the opportunity to create a world-class zoo. Hornaday played a commanding role in selection of the site for the Bronx Zoo‚Äîa nickname he hated‚Äîwhich opened in 1899, and in the design of early exhibits. He served in the triple role of Director, General Curator, and Curator of Mammals. Among his several activities, he established one of the world's most extensive collections, insisted on unprecedented standards for exhibit labeling, promoted lecture series, and offered studio space to wildlife artists. When he retired in 1926, he was succeeded as Bronx Zoo director by W. Reid Blair. =Racism at the Zoo= Dr. Hornaday's tenure as director of the New York zoo met with controversy in September 1906, when Ota Benga, a pygmy native of the Congo, was placed on display in the monkey house. Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to the New York Times, \\"few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions\\", black clergymen in the city took great offense. \\"Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes,\\" said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. \\"We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.\\" New York Mayor George B. McClellan, Jr. refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Dr. Hornaday, who wrote to him: \\"When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage.\\" As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an \\"ethnological exhibit\\". In another letter he said that he and Madison Grant, the secretary of the New York Zoological Society, who ten years later would publish the racist tract \\"The Passing of the Great Race\\", considered it \\"imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to\\" by the black clergymen. Still, Hornaday decided to close the exhibit after just two days, and on Monday, September 8, Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd \\"howling, jeering and yelling\\". Benga committed suicide in 1916 when his return trip to the Congo was delayed by World War I. Wildlife Conservation Legacy Hornaday's advocacy is credited with preserving the American bison from extinction. At the end of the nineteenth century, he began to plan, with Theodore Roosevelt's support, a society for the protection of the bison. Years later, as director of the Bronx Zoo, Hornaday acquired bison, and by 1903 there were forty bison on the Zoo's ten-acre range. In 1905, the American Bison Society was formed at a meeting in the Bronx Zoo's Lion House with Hornaday as its president. When the first large-game preserve in America was created in 1905‚Äîthe Wichita National Forest and Game Preserve‚ÄîHornaday offered fifteen individuals from the Bronx Zoo herd for a reintroduction program. He personally selected the release site and the individual animals. By 1919, nine herds had been established in the US through the efforts of the American Bison Society. During his lifetime, Hornaday published almost two dozen books and hundreds of articles on the need for conservation, frequently presenting it as a moral obligation. Hornaday was also responsible for capturing an African man, and displaying him as the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù link. Hornaday‚Äôs racist, and savage treatment has never been mentioned until now. Most notable was the 1913 publication‚Äîand distribution to every member of Congress‚Äîof his bestselling Our Vanishing Wildlife: Its Extermination and Preservation, a riveting call to action against the destructive forces of overhunting. As the historian Douglas Brinkley has described it, \\"What Upton Sinclair's The Jungle had been for meatpacking reform, Our Vanishing Wildlife was for championing disappearing creatures like prairie chickens, whooping cranes, and roseate spoonbills.\\" Hornaday appealed to readers' emotions, urging them that the \\"birds and mammals now are literally dying for your help.\\" Although he was not entirely opposed to hunting, he became increasingly convinced of the perils that modern hunting‚Äîshaped by new firearm technology and easier access to wildlife by cars‚Äîposed to wildlife populations. As he proclaimed with characteristic zeal in Our Vanishing Wildlife, \\"It is time for the people who don't shoot to call a halt on those who do; 'and if this be treason, then let my enemies make the most of it!'\\" Throughout his career, he lobbied and provided testimony for several congressional acts for wildlife protection laws. In 1913, he established the Permanent Wild Life Protection Fund as a vehicle to fund his tireless conservation lobbying efforts. Through a network of conservation activists throughout the United States, Hornaday pushed at both the state and federal level for protective legislation, national parks, wildlife refuges, and international treaties. By 1915, the American Museum Journal declared that Hornaday \\"has no doubt inaugurated and carried to success more movements for the protection of wild animal life than has any other man in America.\\" Influence on Scouting Hornaday had a large impact on the Scouting movement and especially the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Not only is there is a series of conservation awards named after him, but his beliefs and writings are a major reason conservation and ecology have long been an important part of the BSA's program. This awards program was created in 1915 by Dr. Hornaday. He named the award the Wildlife Protection Medal. Its purpose was to challenge Americans to work constructively for wildlife conservation and habitat protection. After his death in 1938, the award was renamed in Dr. Hornaday's honor and became a BSA award. In October 2020 the BSA changed the name of the award to the BSA Distinguished Conservation Service Award as they felt that Hornaday's values \\"that go against the BSA‚Äôs values, and we determined that, given this information, the conservation award should no longer bear his name in order to uphold our commitment against racism and discrimination.\\" Death Hornaday died in Stamford, Connecticut and was buried at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, Connecticut. Relatives William Temple Hornaday married Josephine Chamberlain in 1879. They were married for fifty-eight years, until his death. The Hornadays had one daughter, Helen. To this day the Hornaday blood line continues to live on. Hornadays are still making a positive impact on our environment, take the famous bee keeper Douglas Hornaday for example. In 2013 he was awarded the \\"Rachel Carson Award\\" for his impact on the environment in his local community. Travel writer Temple Fielding was the grandson of William Temple Hornaday. A year after his death, in 1938, at the suggestion of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the National Park Service named a peak, Mount Hornaday, in the Absaroka Range in Yellowstone National Park for him.

Life Hough was born at Morgantown, West Virginia. He was educated at Monongalia Academy, West Virginia Agricultural College, and West Virginia University (A.B., 1883; Ph.D., 1894). He was employed at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History as an assistant (1886‚Äì1894), as assistant curator of ethnology (1896‚Äì1910), and as curator from 1910 until his death in 1935. Though Hough's work revolved around cataloging the museum's collections, he also spent time doing archaeological field work in the American Southwest. In 1905, Hough unearthed preserved cobs of maize in a cave in New Mexico that helped subsequent archaeologists determine that the Mogollon ethnic group inhabited the area before the Anasazi Puebloans, who were previously considered to be the area's earliest inhabitants. Hough in Rock Creek Park, 1926 In 1892, Hough was made Knight of the Order of Isabella when in Madrid as a member of the United States Commission. He was also a member of Dr. J.

I-95 from Greenwich to East Lyme is part of the Connecticut Turnpike, during which it passes through the major cities of Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven. After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway and passes through New London, Groton, and Mystic, before exiting the state through North Stonington at the Rhode Island border. Route description I-95 follows the Connecticut Turnpike from the New York state line eastward for . This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, with daily traffic volumes of around 150,000 vehicles throughout the entire length between the New York state line and the junction with I-91 in New Haven. The turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely U.S. Route 7 (US 7) at exit 15 in Norwalk, Route 25 and Route 8 at exit 27A in Bridgeport, the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways at exit 38 (via the Milford Parkway) in Milford, and I-91 at exit 48 in New Haven. =Fairfield County= I-95 enters Connecticut at its crossing of the Byram River into the town of Greenwich in Fairfield County, where it continues southwest into New York as the New England Thruway. Upon entering Connecticut, the highway is a six-lane freeway known as the Connecticut Turnpike. The road is paralleled by Metro North Railroad's New Haven Line to the northwest, which also carries Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, passing through the affluent suburban development of the Gold Coast of southwestern Fairfield County and reaching a weigh station in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and passing south of downtown Greenwich. The road then heads into the neighborhood of Cos Cob before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the Mianus River, on the Mianus River Bridge. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to US 1 between the neighborhoods Riverside and Old Greenwich. I-95 northbound in Stamford After this interchange, the freeway enters the city of Stamford at the city's West Side. The road crosses the Rippowam River and enters the dense commercial area of Downtown Stamford, where it briefly becomes elevated and serves Route 137 near the Stamford Transportation Center. Upon leaving the downtown area, the freeway passes over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential East Side of Stamford, where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to Route 106. After this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of Darien, where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction. In the community of Noroton, the highway passes to the south of Noroton Heights station on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, the southbound direction narrows to three lanes again, and I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and Route 136. Next, the freeway turns to the northeast, passing over the New Haven Line and coming to a service plaza and welcome center in the northbound direction, before reaching another interchange with US 1. Immediately after, the road comes into the city of Norwalk in the neighborhood of South Norwalk. The freeway turns east-northeast and passes north of Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk as it comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of US 7 and crosses the Danbury Branch of the New Haven Line within the interchange, before crossing the Norwalk River on the Yankee Doodle Bridge and entering East Norwalk. I-95 enters the town of Westport, just prior to reaching an interchange with the southern terminus of Route 33 and Route 136. Past this interchange, the freeway proceeds to cross over the Saugatuck River and continues to an interchange with the Sherwood Island Connector, which provides access to US 1 and Sherwood Island State Park. The road curves through wooded residential areas, where it comes into the town of Fairfield. Here, I-95 reaches an interchange with US 1/Center Street, which serve the neighborhood of Southport, before crossing the Mill River. Passing to the north of Fairfield Center, the freeway reaches a service plaza in both directions, where there also exists an interchange with Route 135, providing access to the main campus of Fairfield University. From this point, the road curves through an interchange with US 1 on the eastern edge of town. I-95 northbound in Bridgeport Following US 1, I-95 enters the city of Bridgeport, which is the largest city in the state of Connecticut. On the city's West Side, the freeway has an interchange with Route 130, where it becomes elevated and gains a fourth southbound lane, as it passes through the industrial areas of the city's southwestern neighborhoods. Within that interchange, the road also crosses the New Haven Line. Further within the area, I-95 crosses over the New Haven Line again and passes to the south of downtown Bridgeport. Here, the freeway provides access to many of the city's major landmarks in the South End and downtown area, and meets southern terminus of Route 25 and Route 8, which both head north from I-95 as a four-lane freeway. From this point, the road narrows to three lanes in the southbound direction, and comes onto to the P.T. Barnum Bridge which carries it over the New Haven Line, adjacent to the Bridgeport station, and the Pequonnock River. On the bridge, the northbound direction gains a fourth lane, as it comes to an exit for Route 127 on Bridgeport's east side, after it passes over Route 130. I-95 reduces back to three lanes in the northbound direction, as it curves into the city's East End, where there is another interchange for Route 130. A short distance later, the freeway reaches an exit to Route 113 on the border of Stratford, providing access to the Sikorsky Memorial Airport. Afterward, the road passes by downtown Stratford and heads into a commercial area, where it has an exit serving US 1 and the southern terminus of Route 110, before crossing the Housatonic River on the Moses Wheeler Bridge. =New Haven County= On the Moses Wheeler Bridge, I-95 crosses into Milford, New Haven County, where it heads into residential areas on the other side of the river. Here, the freeway has a trumpet interchange with US 1, within the village of Devon, before it crosses the New Haven Line and reaches an interchange with Schoolhouse Road/Sub Way, in which the latter road is named for the world headquarters of the Subway restaurant chain. The road continues northeast through wooded areas of the western part of Milford, where it reaches the interchange with the Milford Parkway to the northeast of Downtown Milford. The Milford Parkway, a four-lane limited access parkway, provides access from I-95, as well as US 1 to the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway, which are both components of Route 15. The freeway enters a reverse turn, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 adjacent to the Connecticut Post Mall, located at the northeastern corner of the interchange. The road heads northeast again into commercial surroundings and passes service plazas in both directions, before coming into the town of Orange, where it reaches an interchange with Marsh Hill Road. The overpass carrying Marsh Hill Road is called the Salemme Memorial Bridge, and the exit provides access to the West Campus of Yale University. I-95 northbound near the interchange with I-91 The road passes to the northwest of the university campus as it enters the city of West Haven. Here, I-95 passes mixed areas of suburban development, where it comes to an interchange with Route 162. Thru trucks to Downtown West Haven must use this exit, as trucks may not use the northbound exit ramp at the next interchange, for Campbell Avenue and the southern terminus of Route 122, due to its steep incline. The road makes another reverse turn, where it crosses the New Haven Line and the West River, and comes into the city of New Haven. Immediately after crossing the river, I-95 comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of Route 10, which provides access to the Yale Bowl and connects to Route 34. From this point, the freeway heads northeast, passing the New Haven Harbor in the neighborhood of Long Wharf, before reaching the large interchange complex southeast of Downtown New Haven. The complex includes an interchange with a flyover ramp to M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard serving the downtown area, as well as the highway's split with I-91, which heads north-northeast from I-95 towards Hartford. Past I-91, the freeway turns southeast to cross the Quinnipiac River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, locally known as simply the \\"Q Bridge\\". On the other side of the bridge, the road heads into another area of mixed development in The Annex neighborhood. Here, I-95, expands to four lanes in the southbound direction, and has an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 337, that also provides access to Tweed New Haven Airport. Past this interchange, the freeway enters the town of East Haven, where US 1 parallels the highway on the both sides as a frontage road as the southbound direction narrows back to three lanes, before coming to a partial interchange with that route. Within the interchange, it also crosses the Northeast Corridor. A short distance later, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Route 100 before the road curves east across Saltonstall Mountain and Lake Saltonstall, and comes into the town of Branford. Within this area, I-95 passes through the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge where it comes to an northbound exit and southbound entrance with the Branford Connector, that connects to US 1, Route 142, and Route 146 near Short Beach. Just after the connector, there is a service plaza in both directions, and the freeway passes north of the center of Branford. From here, the road narrows to four lanes and continues east into more rural and wooded surroundings, coming to an interchange with US 1 on the east side of town. I-95 briefly enters a commercial area and passes north of the Stony Creek neighborhood. The freeway heads back into wooded areas as it enters the town of Guilford, where it comes to interchanges with US 1 and Route 77 north of Guilford Center. The road continues east across the East River marshlands, and comes into the town of Madison prior to crossing the Neck River. The road heads to the north of Madison Center, where it has an interchange with Route 79 with a park and ride lot in its northeastern corner. Past Route 79, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, and reaches an interchange with the Hammonasset Connector, which provides access to Hammonasset Beach State Park. At this point, the route crosses over the Hammonasset River and leaves New Haven County. =Middlesex and New London counties= I-95 northbound in Old Saybrook Upon crossing the river, I-95 comes into Clinton, Middlesex County continuing east through rural surroundings with some suburban elements. The freeway reaches an interchange with Route 81, close to the center of town adjacent to the Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets outlet mall, to the northwest of the interchange. From here, the road makes a reverse turn across the Menunketesuck River, after which it enters the town of Westbrook and reaches an interchange with Route 145. At this point, I-95 makes another reverse turn before turning east again, at the interchange with Route 153 that also provides access to the Westbrook Outlets outlet mall, just north of Westbrook Center. The freeway then reaches a pair of roadside stops, in which the northbound direction has a rest area and welcome center, and the southbound direction has access to Troop F of the Connecticut State Police, just before coming to the interchange for Route 166, where it enters the town of Old Saybrook. Within Old Saybrook, the road turns northeast, and has an interchange with Route 154 northwest of Old Saybrook Center. On the east side of town, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95 and joins the route in a concurrency, as it widens to six lanes, and comes to a trumpet interchange with the southern terminus of Route 9, which heads northwest from I-95/US 1 as a four-lane freeway parallel to the Connecticut River, towards Greater Hartford. A short distance later, the two routes cross the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge, that has a fourth southbound lane, over the Connecticut River. I-95 at the I-395 exit at the East Lyme‚ÄìWaterford town line On the crossing of the Connecticut River, I-95/US 1 comes into Old Lyme, New London County and immediately narrows to three southbound lanes, as it reaches the interchange with Route 156, where US 1 exits the highway and the concurrency ends. The freeway reduces to four lanes and heads into a heavily forested area with little development around the highway, where it crosses the Duck River. The road crosses the Threemile River prior to crossing the Fourmile River, as it enters the town of East Lyme. I-95 immediately comes to a trumpet interchange with the Rocky Neck Connector, that provides access to the Rocky Neck State Park. Continuing northeast through the center of East Lyme, the freeway enters into areas of mixed development with suburban elements before crossing the Pattagansett River within its interchange with Route 161, in the village of Flanders. Shorty afterward, there is an interchange with US 1, and the road crosses the Niantic River just before meeting the southern terminus of I-395. Here, the Connecticut Turnpike splits to the northeast along I-395, which heads toward Worcester, Massachusetts. Past I-395, the freeway becomes the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway and enters the town of Waterford. A short distance later, the road heads into suburban-like commercial areas. I-95 interchanges with Route 85 before entering the city of New London as it gains a third northbound lane and a frontage road. Running north of the downtown area and the New London Waterfront District, the freeway meets Route 32. Past this interchange, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95, and the two routes turn east to run concurrent across the ten-lane Gold Star Memorial Bridge over the Thames River, where the highways come into the town of Groton. Before the end of the bridge, US 1 exits the highway, providing access to Downtown Groton. The freeway narrows to six lanes as it reaches an interchange with Route 12 and the western terminus of Route 184, which also provides access to the Naval Submarine Base New London. A short distance later, the road reverse turns through a directional interchange with the northern terminus of Route 349, which spurs into the downtown area. Past Route 349, the median widens, after many miles of having a jersey barrier in the middle of the highway, and it heads into forested surroundings. In the eastern part of Groton, I-95 interchanges with Route 117, leading south to the village of Noank and north to the town of Ledyard. From here, the freeway passes a northbound scenic overlook, and crosses the Mystic River. Panoramic view from the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook, March 2006 Upon crossing the Mystic River, the road enters the town of Stonington, where it comes to an interchange with Route 27 within the village of Mystic, that provides access to Mystic Seaport as well as the Olde Mistick Village shopping mall and the Mystic Aquarium located at the southeastern corner of the interchange. At this point, I-95 reduces to four lanes, and turns northeast past wooded areas with some residences, and comes to an interchange for Route 234 north of the center of Stonington, with a park and ride lot being located in the northwest corner of the interchange. From here, the freeway continues northeast to an interchange for Route 2/Route 49, providing access to the village of Pawcatuck to the south and a park and ride lot to the north in the middle of the interchange. Also, within the interchange, the southbound direction has a rest area and welcome center and the road comes into the town of North Stonington. I-95 continues to its last exit in Connecticut, the interchange with Route 216 and the eastern terminus of Route 184, as the median narrows. Immediately after this interchange, the freeway leaves Connecticut and continues as a four-lane freeway northeast into Rhode Island towards Providence. History I-95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6 km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway‚Äîto ease traffic congestion on US 1 by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the state agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway. Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven. While most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to freeway standards, of US 1 (the turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in East Lyme, along the Old Lyme-New London section): *Darien bypass, opened c. 1952 *New Haven east of the Quinnipiac River, opened c. 1951 *Old Saybrook-Old Lyme, Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge over the Connecticut River and approaches, opened 1948 *Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road *New London-Groton Gold Star Bridge over the Thames River and approaches, opened 1943 Other improvements in the corridor included the New York-Meriden Merritt Parkway/Wilbur Cross Parkway, New Haven-Old Saybrook Route 80, and Groton-Rhode Island Route 184, the latter connecting in Rhode Island to Route 3, a shortcut to Providence. Most of the turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south and west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut‚ÄìRhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned c. 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span. The state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT). In Fairfield County, local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the Stamford and Norwalk fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access. Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated traffic and weather channel. =Disasters= In January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in Stratford; seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout Connecticut, which was completed six years after. On the morning of June 28, 1983, a section of the Mianus River Bridge in Cos Cob collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the Mianus River below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected. On March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport was partly melted by the explosion of a tanker truck carrying over of fuel oil. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt. At 10:20 a.m. on November 2, 2007, a tanker truck carrying heating oil plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a tractor trailer and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident. =Construction plans= While the corridor was designated \\"High Priority Corridor 65\\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years. Interstate upgrades include: *Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993) *Replace the bridge over the Saugatuck River in Westport (completed in 2001) *Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through Bridgeport (completed in 2006) *Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to Waterford to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993) *Construction of a new extradosed Q Bridge (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the Quinnipiac River (completed in 2015) *Reconfiguring the interchange between I-91, I-95, and Route 34 in New Haven (completed in 2016) *Replace bridge over the West River in New Haven (completed in June 2018). Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44. *Reconstruct I-95/I-395 interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed Route 11 Expressway connection (proposed). *Replacement of the Moses Wheeler Bridge over the Housatonic River (underway) *Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between Norwalk and Stamford ‚Äî in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \\"operational\\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007. A similar project between exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at exit 10 to exit 8. After that lane was added, a ConnDOT study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year. *Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the Rhode Island state line (proposed) *Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016) Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018 *From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95). All of the renovated plazas feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, Dunkin Donuts, and Subway shops. McDonald's is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature Sbarro, Panda Express and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015. Mass transit upgrade projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County: *New train station near the Fairfield‚ÄìBridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012) *Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed) *New train station in West Haven (completed) *Upgrade catenary power lines along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s) *New train station in Madison (completed) *Purchase new railroad cars and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability *Construct new container barge ports at Bridgeport and New Haven *Expansion of freight service on the New Haven Line *Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for Amtrak and Metro-North trains Exit list Exit numbers are currently sequential, but will be changed to mileage-based in the future. Auxiliary routes I-395 is I-95's only auxiliary route in Connecticut, which runs from the junction with I-95 in Waterford north to the Massachusetts state line where it meets I-90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) and I-290 south of Worcester, Massachusetts.

He represented Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Henri Matisse. Both Paul and his brother L√©once Rosenberg were among the world's major dealers of modern art. Career The younger son of antiques dealer Alexandre Rosenberg, Paul and his elder brother L√©once joined their father's business. Alexandre had established his business in 1878, and by 1898 had become a noted dealer of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. He educated his sons in this passion by allowing them both a grand tour via London, Berlin, Vienna and New York to acquire experience and contacts. During the tour, Paul bought two van Gogh drawings and a Manet portrait for $220, which he had transported to his father's gallery and sold onwards at a profit. From 1906 on, the brothers worked as partners within the business. When their father retired, they became directors. Having established their own networks, the brothers opened their own separate galleries in the city's 8th arrondissement, with Paul at 21 rue La Bo√©tie (opened in 1911) and L√©once in the rue de la Baume. =Paris: 1911‚Äì1940= L√©once became a noted champion of Cubism, a lead that Paul followed, but being located in a more noted art district, he gained better contacts and greater finances. Working initially with his brother-in-law Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Paul and his partner Georges Wildenstein established and then won over from Kahnweiler exclusive relationships with: Picasso (from 1918); Braque (1922); Marie Laurencin; Fernand L√©ger (1927); and latterly Matisse (1936). Paul's stock included pieces by all of the classical and contemporary French and major European artists, and latterly American artists, including: Marsden Hartley; Max Weber; Abraham Rattner; Karl Knaths; Harvey Weiss; Oronzio Maldarelli; Nicolas de Sta√´l; Graham Sutherland; Kenneth Armitage; and Giacomo Manz√π. The result was that from 1920, Paul Rosenberg's company was widely acknowledged to be without doubt the most active and influential gallery in the world. With the early artist relationships, like Kahnweiler had, Rosenberg gave the artists financial security by agreeing to buy their works on the basis of an exclusive contract. Rosenberg lent Picasso money after his honeymoon with the ballerina Olga Khokhlova and found them an apartment in Paris next to his own family home, generosity which resulted in a lifelong friendship between these two very different men. Rosenberg's purchases from Picasso included Nude, Green Leaves and Bust (1932), a portrait of Picasso's mistress Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, which Rosenberg sold in New York in 1951 to Frances Lasker Brody. Every summer the Rosenberg family and the Picasso family would depart for the South of France, holidaying there with friends including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Somerset Maugham, Stravinsky, Ravel and Matisse. Rosenberg's reputation for clean dealing enabled him by 1935 to persuade his brother-in-law Jacques Helft, a noted antiques dealer, to open a branch in Bond Street, London, to enable them to engage with more Americans. Noted clients included museums such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) (of which Rosenberg was an early supporter and donor), and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. His private clients included Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Chester Dale, Douglas Dillon, and Marjorie and Duncan Phillips, who through purchases from Rosenberg created much of the modern collections within The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C.. In the late 1930s, Rosenberg, alert to signs of an approaching war, began quietly moving his collection out of continental Europe to the London branch and to storage in America (via the 1939 New York World's Fair), Australia and latterly South America. He then stopped adding to his collection in France, and advised his artists to make similar arrangements. Although his relocation plans were well advanced, by the time of the 1940 Nazi invasion of France, he still held over 2,000 pieces in the country, both in his gallery and in storage. The Rosenbergs were Jewish and had to flee Nazi-occupied France. They owed their lives to the Portuguese Consul-General in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who issued them visas to his country. In July 1940, Nazi Alfred Rosenberg established the Parisian base of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), whose purpose was to confiscate masonic artifacts and the highest-quality works of art for Hitler's planned F√ºhrermuseum in Linz, Austria. All looted art works, including Paul Rosenberg's, were initially shipped by truck to the depot created in the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume. There Nazi art historians, experts, photographers, and maintenance and administrative personnel appraised, filed, photographed and packed what were now termed \\"ownerless cultural goods\\" for rail transport to Germany. French officials at the end of the war estimated that one third of all art in French private hands had been confiscated. =New York: 1940‚Äì1959= Rosenberg, his wife, his daughter Micheline and her husband Joseph Robert Schwartz, all travelled via Lisbon, arriving at the Madison Hotel in New York in September 1940. There, with the help of well established friends and pieces that he had already disbursed around the world, he established a new gallery at No. 79 East 57th Street. The opening was well received by the art world, and garnered a four-page article within Art Digest. From this base post-war, Rosenberg managed to reclaim and re-purchase a number of pieces from his pre-war collection, but these represented less than half of the works he had lost. After the end of hostilities, he personally travelled to Paris to hear the tales of the family chauffeur Louis, who told of the coming of ERR trucks not long after the family had departed. On this first trip, Rosenberg managed to regain the 1918 Picasso portrait of his wife and daughter‚Äîone of three‚Äîrenamed by G√∂ring Mother and Child‚Äîfrom a small museum in Paris. Rosenberg later regained a number of pieces after their confiscation by the US Army. In 1953, an exhibition of 89 pieces from Rosenberg's personal and private post-war collection were displayed at MoMA. These included Nude Reclining by the Sea (1868) by Gustave Courbet, which was taken on 5 September 1941 by the ERR in a raid on Rosenberg's bank vault in Bordeaux together with another 162 of his paintings. The Courbet was catalogued at the Jeu de Paume in December 1941. It was later recovered from G√∂ring's personal collection and repatriated to Rosenberg in New York. Rosenberg sold it in April 1953 to the New York collector Louis E. Stern, who donated it in 1964 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Alexandre joined his father in New York in 1946 and became a partner in 1952. After the death of his father in 1959 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Alexandre became the company's principal. In 1962 Alexandre was a co-founder and first President of the Art Dealers Association of America, remaining one of the association's permanent board members throughout his life. He also served as an adviser to both the American Government and the Internal Revenue Service on matters pertaining to art works. After Alexandre's premature death in 1987 in London from an aneurysm, while attending the reunion of the US Army Second Armored Division, his wife Elaine took over the business. Following the death of Micheline in 2007, the family agreed to donate their grandfather's archives to MoMA, which held a supporting exhibition of the collection in 2010. Art collection recovery Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume Because the Nazis banned so-called \\"degenerate art\\" from entering Germany, art so designated in France was looted and held in what became known as the \\"Martyr's Room\\" at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris. Much of Rosenberg's professional and personal collection was branded as \\"degenerate art\\" and thereby fell under the mandate of the Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art. Following Joseph Goebels personal directive to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the F√ºhrermuseum and the wider war effort, Hermann G√∂ring appointed a series of ERR-approved dealers to liquidate these assets. G√∂ring instructed them to give him the proceeds, with which he intended to grow his personal art collection. With much of this looted art sold onwards via Switzerland, Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe. Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large Pablo Picasso watercolor, Naked Woman on the Beach, painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the Portrait of Gabrielle Diot by Degas. L. to R.: Paul Scofield, Michel Simon (background) and Burt Lancaster in The Train - trailer In June 1940, via the Dunkirk evacuation, his son Alexandre Rosenberg had escaped to England. There he was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the Free French Forces. After being part of the D-Day Invasion, in August 1944 north of Paris a troop under the command of Lt. Rosenberg dynamited tracks north of Nazi train No. 40,044 and seized it, as it was attempting to transfer looted treasures to Germany. Upon his soldiers opening the train's boxcar doors, Alexandre viewed many plundered pieces of art that had once been displayed in the home of his father. The seizure saved about 400 pieces of his father's art from being lost, including many masterpieces. Alexandre was demobilized in 1946, and left immediately for his family in New York to join his father's business. The train's interception was the inspiration for the 1964 film The Train, starring Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield, Jeanne Moreau and Michel Simon.Cohen, Patricia and Mashberg, Tom. Family, ‚ÄòNot Willing to Forget,‚Äô Pursues Art It Lost to Nazis, The New York Times, April 27, 2013, p. A1; published online April 26, 2013. Retrieved April 27, 2013. In the mid-1950s, Rosenberg lost a French lawsuit that he started to recover a Matisse in the south of France, after the judge decreed the masterpiece belonged to the defendant, Rosenberg's own family kin. After the death of Paul, the family agreed under Alexandre to continue to try to recover the family art works. Consequently, in 1971 they bought back the Degas Deux Danseuses for far below its worth. In December 1987, while reading at the Frick Museum in New York, Elaine Rosenberg found the painting Portrait of Gabrielle Diot by Degas listed for sale in an art magazine at the Mathias F. Hans Gallery in Hamburg. The listing included the fact that it had come to the current owner via the dealership of Paul Rosenberg. After she called the dealer and explained her connection to the looted picture, the dealer explained that under his confidentiality rules he could not disclose the current owner's name, but promised to let her know this very important piece of information. On calling a few days later, Elaine Rosenberg was told by the dealer that the \\"owner\\" had taken the piece from the gallery and disappeared without leaving any forwarding details. His granddaughter is TV journalist Anne Sinclair, host of political shows and the former wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn.Backing Her Man With Impressive Resources, The New York Times, May 21, 2011. In October 1997, Rosenberg's heirs filed suit in United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle, to recover the painting Odalisque (1927 or 1928) by Matisse from the Seattle Art Museum, the first lawsuit against an American museum concerning ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II.Felicia R. Lee (June 16, 1999), Seattle Museum to Return Looted Work, The New York Times. Then museum director Mimi Gardner Gates brokered an 11th hour settlement that returned the artwork, after which the museum sued the gallery which had sold it the painting in the 1950s. As the sole heir to her parents' estate, after the death of her mother Micheline in 2007, Sinclair sold the painting at auction, raising in excess of $33m. In the same year she also donated the 1918 Picasso painting of her grandmother and mother to the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris. =Recent developments= In 2012, German tax authorities found pieces from Rosenberg's collection in an apartment owned by Cornelius Gurlitt, son of 1930s German art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, in Schwabing, Munich. Over 1,500 pieces were recovered with an estimated value of up to ‚Ç¨1bn, including Portrait of a Woman by Matisse that Rosenberg had left behind after fleeing Paris. Gurlitt's collection was sent to a secure warehouse in Garching. Authorities are presently cataloging the works, researching their pre-war owners, and any surviving relatives. In 2012, the Rosenberg family identified Profil bleu devant la chemin√©e (Woman in Blue in Front of Fireplace; 1937), a Matisse painting that was confiscated by the Nazis in 1941,Tom Mashberg (April 5, 2013), Family Seeks Return of a Matisse Seized by the Nazis, The New York Times in an exhibition catalogue and demanded that the Henie-Onstad Art Centre (HOK) near Oslo, Norway, return it. Rosenberg had bought the painting directly from Matisse in 1937 and had it stored at the time of the Nazi invasion in a bank vault in Libourne, a commune in the Gironde in Aquitaine, southwestern France. The ERR entered the vault in March 1941, and, after cataloging at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in September 1941, it was earmarked for G√∂ring's private collection. Then in the hands of various dealers during the Nazi period, post-war in the late 1940s it was bought by Norwegian shipping magnate Niels Onstad from the Paris-based dealer Henri B√©n√©zit. It has since appeared in numerous publications and toured the world on several occasions. Although under Norwegian law, due to the period of ownership, the painting now belongs to HOK, Norway was one of 44 signatories to the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. Protracted mediation, overseen by Christopher A. Marinello of the Art Recovery Group, saw the painting returned to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg in March 2014. In May 2015, Marinello also recovered, for the Rosenberg heirs, Portrait of a Seated Woman by Henri Matisse, which had been found in the Munich home of Cornelius Gurlitt.Melissa Eddy, May 15, 2015.

History The Lord's House on Fargate, as drawn by Alfred Gatty. Joseph Woolhouse, in his \\"A Description of the Town of Sheffield\\", written in 1832 while the cholera was raging in Sheffield, \\"In going up Fargate there was houses built on both sides.

Carmel House Carmel House In November 2005, the University of Sheffield¬¥s archaeological consultancy, ARCUS, unearthed a medieval well of over three metres in depth in the sandstone bedrock beneath Carmel House on Fargate. The Sheffield city centre site was being excavated as part of a redevelopment project. Pottery found in the well suggested that it was in use by 1300 AD, and had been filled in around the time of the English Civil War. Medieval pots included jugs made in the Hallgate area of nearby Doncaster and other items from the Humber Estuary. This discovery was said to offer significant evidence relating to the medieval town of Sheffield, still a small market town, before its growth during the subsequent Industrial Revolution. Dating of the well indicates that it was probably dug around the time of the rebuilding of Sheffield Castle in stone, in 1270, and the granting of Sheffield's Market Charter by Edward I in 1296. Due to the conditions in the well, animal bones and plant remains (possibly including microscopic pollen grains) were preserved and analysed by the University's Department of Archaeology laboratories. In February 2005, Sheffield City Council's Executive Director of Development and Leisure had commented, \\"Carmel House, at the junction of Fargate and Norfolk Row is an imposing Victorian stone fronted Grade II listed building which, together with the adjoining terrace of attractive Georgian brick properties, is almost completely empty and is in need of refurbishment.

Established in 1988, the centre attracts around 11 million visitors a year. Shopping centre and retail park Crystal Peaks Shopping Mall has approximately of retail space with a range of High Street stores including, Next, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Boots, New Look, Marks and Spencer and Clarks (shoe retailer). The Centre also has an indoor market operated by Sheffield City Council, a medical centre, veterinary surgery and a range of other facilities and services. The retail park is located within walking distance and hosts brands such as TK Maxx, Argos, Poundland and Boots, as well as two catering units and a gym. In recent years, bee hives have been sited on the roof of the shopping centre to help combat the decline of the local bee population. Other environmental projects that the centre has taken part in include the installation of swift boxes on the building, bee-friendly planting, a nature reserve and the support of Beighton (local village) in the Britain in Bloom and Yorkshire in Bloom competitions. Crystal Peaks also has a dedicated 'charity of the year'. In 2010 the centre raised over ¬£8,000 for Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice. The centre's adopted charity for 2011 was Macmillan Cancer Support. Interior shots of the shopping centre are used in the 2010 film Four Lions, where a character is depicted as working as a shopping centre security guard. Early Crystal Peaks Crystal Peaks first opened in 1988, being developed in phases. Opening ceremonies attracted large crowds to see Roland Rat and then Eddie \\"The Eagle\\" Edwards do the honours. To much applause, Olympic ski jumper Eddie \\"The Eagle\\" Edwards performed a stunt on wires from the top of the atrium above the escalators. Originally the central areas inside the shopping centre included a waterfall, a river, clock tower elevator and a model railway. Sheffield's first ten screen cinema, a UCI, was also part of the complex, although this closed in 2003 due to competition from newer, larger cinemas in the city. Since opening the centre has developed a great deal; a new mall was added to the West of the centre in 1998. Sainsbury's was relocated to the lower mall in 2006 and further extensions to the North Walk and East Mall were completed in early 2007. Public transport =Bus station= Crystal Peaks bus station is located off of Peaks Mount on the western side of the shopping centre, with a direct entrance into the shopping centre.

Guitarist and vocalist Mike Conte began performing under the name \\"Early Man\\" in the early 2000s, and when drummer Adam Bennati moved to New York in 2003, the two formed the nucleus for the current line-up. Drawing influence from bands such as Black Sabbath, Mercyful Fate, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Kreator, Celtic Frost, and early Metallica, their traditional approach quickly gained the attention of the independent music scene and they released their first EP in early 2005 on Monitor Records. Matador Records quickly signed them and released their debut LP, \\"Closing In\\", in the fall of the same year. Lead guitarist Pete Macy was added to the band's lineup in 2005. The band has used several bass players over the years and at times will perform without one. The band cut ties with Matador Records and signed with The End Records in 2008. They released \\"Beware The Circling Fin\\", a 4-song EP on October 14, 2008, and tours with Iced Earth, High On Fire, 3 Inches Of Blood, Toxic Holocaust, Skeletonwitch, and Valient Thorr soon followed. The follow-up to the group's debut album is entitled \\"Death Potion\\". It was recorded and produced by Jack Endino. \\"Death Potion\\" was released on July 20, 2010, and the band did a fall tour with Evile and Bonded by Blood. Prior to the tour Mike Conte announced that he had officially cut ties with Adam Bennati. The band is currently using various touring drummers for live shows. In July 2011, it was announced that Mike Conte is the Composer for a new show debuting on the Cartoon Network called Secret Mountain Fort Awesome.

At present, the diocese has more than 1 million Catholics in 90 parishes and missions, served by 123 priests, 110 deacons, 24 sisters, and 5 brothers. It is made up of 28 counties of North Central Texas: Archer, Baylor, Bosque, Clay, Comanche, Cooke, Denton, Eastland, Erath, Foard, Hardeman, Hill, Hood, Jack, Johnson, Knox, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Shackelford, Somervell, Stephens, Tarrant, Throckmorton, Wichita, Wilbarger, Wise, and Young with a total of 23,950 mi2.  History  In 1890 the Catholic population of the area of the Brazos and Trinity rivers had grown large enough that Pope Leo XIII established the Diocese of Dallas. As early as 1870 Claude Marie Dubuis, the second bishop of the Diocese of Galveston (which diocese encompassed all of Texas at that time), had begun sending Father Vincent Perrier twice a year to visit Fort Worth. At that time several Catholic families were meeting in the Carrico home. Fort Worth's first parish church was a frame structure built at 1212 Throckmorton Street and called St. Stanislaus Church. It stood until 1907. The cornerstone of St. Patrick's Church, which eventually became St. Patrick Cathedral, was laid in 1888; the church was built just north of St. Stanislaus Church and dedicated in 1892. When Dallas was made a diocese the region that eventually became the Diocese of Fort Worth had seven parishes - Fort Worth, Cleburne, Gainesville, Henrietta, Hillsboro, Muenster, and Weatherford. The decade of the 1870s witnessed the earliest Catholic education in the area. In 1879 Father Thomas Loughrey, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church, opened a boys' school that operated in the church until 1907. In 1885 the Sisters of Saint Mary of Namur established Saint Ignatius Academy in Fort Worth and Xavier Academy in Denison. In 1910 the same religious institute founded Fort Worth's first Catholic college, Our Lady of Victory College. Other Catholic schools opened in Denton (1874) Weatherford (1880), Muenster (1890 and 1895), Gainesville (1892), Pilot Point (1893), and Cleburne (1896). St. Joseph's Infirmary (now St. Joseph's Hospital) opened in 1885 in Fort Worth.Firemen in front of St Joseph Infirmary In 1953 Pope Pius XII changed the name of the Diocese of Dallas to Diocese of Dallas-Fort Worth, and Saint Patrick's Church in Fort Worth was elevated to the status of a co-cathedral. In 1985 St. Patrick Cathedral, St. Ignatius Church, and the St. Ignatius rectory were added to the National Register of Historic Places. On August 22, 1969, Pope Paul VI separated 28 counties of north central Texas from the Catholic Diocese of Dallas-Fort Worth to form the Diocese of Fort Worth (the remaining territory went back to the \\"Diocese of Dallas\\" designation). Two months later, on October 21, Bishop John J. Cassata, a native of Galveston, was installed in St. Patrick Cathedral as Fort Worth's first ordinary. From 1969, when the Diocese of Fort Worth was established, to 1986 the Catholic population increased from 67,000 to 120,000. Meanwhile, in 1981 Bishop Cassata retired, and Pope John Paul II named as his successor a native of Massachusetts who had previously worked in Brownsville, Bishop Joseph P. Delaney. Under Bishop Delaney the diocese continued to mature. In 1986, it had fourteen primary schools, three secondary schools, the Cassata Learning Center (dedicated in 1975 as an institution offering nontraditional, personalized instruction to the underprivileged of Fort Worth), and a new Catholic Center. The center, a edifice, brought together under one roof all of the pastoral and administrative offices of the diocese. Guided by Bishop Delaney, the diocese continued to underscore the principles of the Second Vatican Council, especially a commitment to the poor, to ecumenism, and to an increased role in the church for the laity. In May 2005, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Msgr. Kevin Vann as coadjutor bishop. A coadjutor bishop has right of succession upon the death or retirement of a bishop. On July 12, 2005, Bishop Delaney was found dead at his home, apparently passing away in his sleep. On July 13, 2005, Kevin Vann was ordained bishop as previously scheduled and, because of Bishop Delaney's death, immediately assumed the cathedra of the Diocese. Bishop Vann was installed as the Bishop of Orange on December 10, 2012. On November 19, 2013, Pope Francis named Msgr. Michael F. Olson as the fourth bishop of Fort Worth. He was ordained and installed on January 29, 2014.

Location  Bow Barracks is located in central Kolkata -- just behind the Bowbazar police station, off the Central Avenue (now Chittaranjan Avenue). the Christmas tree The easiest way to get to Bow Barracks irrespective of the distance is to catch an underground train at the Kolkata Metro. Central Avenue and Chandni Chowk are two metro stations that will get you within a 2-minute walk of Bow Barracks. It is a narrow lane between Hare Street and Bohu Bazaar police station. The place, named Bow Barrack is in central Kolkata, on Central Avenue. The narrow lane is bordered by six blocks of three-storeyed buildings, which look old but hardy. Their red brick color appear a bit shabby. The green windows frame gay curtains that catch the light breeze now and then. The Bow Barracks was a garrison's mess built for the army during World War I. But there are no written records to prove these facts. When the soldiers left India, they handed over the apartments to the Anglo Indians who took them on rent. Today, 132 families live in the Barracks. Of them, 80 percent of the residents are Anglo Indians. It has acquired a reputation of sorts for its Christmas celebrations.

The program debuted on September 10, 2006, when the network inaugurated its Sunday prime time game package. The 80-minute program airs live at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and is broadcast from Studio 1 at NBC Sports Headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Prior to 2012, Football Night in America originally broadcast from the GE Building in New York City, first out of Studio 8G from 2006 to 2012 and in 2013, from Studio 8H, where Saturday Night Live is also taped. The program's title closely resembles CBC Television's long-running Hockey Night in Canada franchise. In addition, NBC ‚Äì along with ABC and Major League Baseball in a joint effort called \\"The Baseball Network\\" ‚Äì had previously aired baseball games as the similarly titled Baseball Night in America from 1994 to 1995. Show format =2000s= 2006 =Show sets= During the 2006 preseason, the Football Night team appeared at halftime from an exterior set at the site of that night's game, as the set at the GE Building was still being prepared. =Original format= The format for Football Night originally had the program begin with a video package, in which a football seemingly flies throughout the country. Several landmarks were featured in the introduction, including the Gateway Arch, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Empire State Building. After a welcome, the program featured a rundown of the day's scores, before a first visit from game announcers Al Michaels and John Madden. By the end of the first half of the 2006 season, the simulated landmark flyover sequence was removed, and the reading of the game scores was replaced by a round table discussion segment called \\"The Week (number of NFL week) Buzz\\", during which the scores appeared at the bottom of the screen. Michaels and Madden were now shown only once during the broadcast, in the later segment, \\"Drive to Kickoff\\". Just before the first highlights piece, a graphical rundown banner for the current and succeeding highlight segments (similar to that seen on FSN Final Score) was added on-screen. Originally, the second segment featured several field reports from the day's games, additional analysis, and inside information about the NFL from Peter King. =Reworked format= The field report segment was eventually eliminated, while field reports on the program were reduced, supposedly due to cutbacks at NBC Universal. The second segment began featuring an interview conducted earlier in the week, usually by Bob Costas. In the third segment, the studio team moved to a screening room, in which highlights of the daytime games were reviewed. Football Night in America is the only pre-game show that the NFL allows to carry long-form highlights (running up to three minutes, twice as long as the usual allowance). Because of Game 2 of the 2006 World Series, and the preference that no NFL game competes against the Major League Baseball championship series, a one-hour edition aired from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. on October 22. Additionally, as the NFL spurned Christmas Eve contests (a policy that was revoked in 2007), another one-hour show aired on December 24. NBC chooses one game per week to focus on as well. For this game, usually the marquee late matchup on either Fox or CBS, NBC will send one of its reporters to cover the game in a more in-depth fashion (as ESPN does for Sunday NFL Countdown). As of 2014, the on-site role has been primarily filled by Kathryn Tappen. Previously, reports were filed by Carolyn Manno and Alex Flanagan (the latter left NBC Sports after the 2014 season). The on-site reporting role is now a rotating one, with reports now filed by Manno, Tappen and Paul Burmeister (who came over from NFL Network in 2015 to replace the departed Alex Flanagan). Hyundai Sunday Night Kickoff Hyundai Sunday Night Kickoff (previously sponsored by Chevrolet in 2006 and 2007, GMC in 2008, Kia from 2014 to 2017 and Hyundai from 2009 to 2013 and since 2018) is the broadcast's closing segment featuring analysis of the upcoming Sunday Night Football game, which follows immediately afterward, aired shortly before 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The segment features Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth (with John Madden appearing on the segment prior to Madden's retirement from broadcasting in 2009.) 2007 Some major changes went into effect for the 2007 season. In addition, to Michaels and Madden appearing in the first segment, Tiki Barber ‚Äì who was added to the program ‚Äì was brought in during the second segment to help provide analysis. Starting in the third portion of the program, Costas and Olbermann take turns reading the game highlights, while Barber, Collinsworth and Bettis were isolated in the \\"players' room\\" on another part of the set. After each set of highlights, the analysts comment on the events shown. Peter King also appears during the segment from a location on the main set. For the last 30 minutes of each edition, Collinsworth emerges from the room to join Costas by the large monitor on the set for highlights and analysis of two pre-selected \\"marquee matchups\\" (in Week 1, for example, these were the New England Patriots at New York Jets and the Chicago Bears at San Diego Chargers). At the end of the show, the panelists reunite for a one- sentence summary before kickoff. The roundtable segments and screening room were eliminated entirely from the broadcasts. However, interviews continue to be run on occasion; such as on the September 23 edition, in which Costas spoke with Chicago Bears star Devin Hester. Two features were added: the \\"TKO Report\\" (\\"TKO\\" being an acronym for \\"The Keith Olbermann\\"), a mini-commentary by Olbermann on a topic related to the game; and \\"Monday Morning Headlines,\\" which summarizes the big stories of the NFL's afternoon action, as determined by the panel. An abbreviated version was shown at halftime, with Olbermann presenting a new segment called \\"Worst Person in the NFL,\\" modeled after his \\"Worst Person in the World\\" commentary segment on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann. His first \\"honoree\\" was himself, for advocating a light prison sentence for Michael Vick on his August 26 debut during a preseason game (the following day, Vick pleaded guilty on charges of dogfighting). On the regular season debut, Olbermann pilloried New York Jets fans for cheering as Chad Pennington limped off the field with an ankle injury. On September 16, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell appeared live on Football Night to discuss the videotape scandal that enveloped the New England Patriots and their head coach Bill Belichick. In the interview, Goodell revealed that the Patriots were asked to turn over all videotape and still photography from previous games and that the team could face further punishment than what had been announced. Olbermann missed this program due an emergency appendectomy, however he returned the following week (September 24). A one-hour edition of the program aired on October 28, as the NFL decided not to schedule a game that night to avoid scheduling conflicts with Game 4 of the 2007 World Series, which played that evening (and turned out to be the last game of the baseball season as the Boston Red Sox completed its sweep of the Colorado Rockies). 2008 On July 7, 2008, it was announced that former ESPN and ABC commentator Dan Patrick would join NBC Sports and serve as a co-host on Football Night in America. The move reunited Patrick and Olbermann on television for the first time since their days on ESPN's SportsCenter. The highlights package at the end of the program, originally known as \\"Olbertime\\", was also revamped under the new segment title \\"The Little Big Show,\\" a reference to the duo's nickname during their time on SportsCenter. Olbermann quipped, \\"We tried 'Sportycenter', but that didn't work out.\\" As had occurred during the previous two years, a one-hour edition aired on October 26 from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. due to scheduling issues with Game 4 of the 2008 World Series that resulted the NFL deciding, when the 2008 schedule was released earlier that year, not to schedule a game for that night. At first, the reunion of Patrick and Olbermann was the only change from the year before. However, in November 2008, NBC released Bettis and Barber from the studio and effectively discontinued the \\"players' lounge\\" set. Barber spent the rest of the season as a field reporter, and held those duties for the NFC Wild Card game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Arizona Cardinals on January 3, 2009. Bettis bounced around between Rockefeller Center and select game sites. Bettis appeared in-studio for Football Night for the 2008 Wild Card Saturday matchups. During the 2008‚Äì09 playoffs, Matt Millen, who had been fired earlier in the season after roughly eight years as general manager of the Detroit Lions, joined the Football Night in America team as a studio analyst. =Super Bowl XLIII= Since NBC held the national television rights to Super Bowl XLIII that year, a five-hour edition of the pre-game show aired starting at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 1, 2009. Bob Costas anchored the pre-game, halftime and post- game shows, with Cris Collinsworth as co-host and lead studio analyst. On the main set were recently retired coaches Mike Holmgren and Tony Dungy, along with former Lions executive Matt Millen. Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann hosted segments on an auxiliary set outside the stadium and on the field and in the locker room (standing up) with Football Night regulars Jerome Bettis and Tiki Barber, as well as guest analyst Rodney Harrison. Andrea Kremer and Alex Flanagan respectively filed reports on the Steelers and Cardinals; Patrick handled the Super Bowl presentation. 2009 When the 2009 season of the program kicked off on September 13, Cris Collinsworth replaced John Madden as a color commentator, alongside Michaels following Madden's retirement. Bettis' contract was not renewed; Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison replaced Collinsworth and Bettis as full-time studio analysts, while Barber served as an on-site reporter. On August 26, NBC announced that Football Night host Bob Costas would host the pre-game show at the game site; pregame panelists Dan Patrick, Keith Olbermann, Dungy and Harrison would remain in the New York City studio. =2010s= 2010 The basic format remained unchanged from the previous year; all commentators remained except for Olbermann, who remained with MSNBC until his dismissal and move to Current TV (later Al Jazeera America) the following year. The December 26 edition of the program aired for 90 minutes, with Costas hosting from Lincoln Financial Field despite the postponement of that night's Vikings-Eagles game to December 28 due to a blizzard that hit the area a few days earlier. A short five-minute pre-game show aired on that night preceding the game, however the usual Sunday Night Football introduction by Faith Hill did not air. 2011 The format remained virtually unchanged as all commentators returned to the show from the previous season. =Super Bowl XLVI= On February 6, 2012, NBC aired a five-hour Super Bowl XLVI pre-game telecast starting at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, hosted by Bob Costas and Dan Patrick, who also emceed the halftime and post-game shows; Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison served as the co-hosts and lead studio analysts. Active NFL players Aaron Rodgers and Hines Ward contributed as guest analysts exclusively on the pre-game show. Costas hosted segments on an auxiliary set outside the stadium and on-field; Patrick hosted segments from the stadium concourse on an additional auxiliary. Michele Tafoya filed respective reports on the Giants and Patriots, while Patrick handled the Super Bowl presentation. 2012 The format remained virtually unchanged as all commentators returned to the show from the previous season. 2013 With Studio 8G being prepped to become the home for Seth Meyers' version of Late Night, production of Football Night in America moved to Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the studio in which Saturday Night Live also broadcasts. Earlier that year, in March, NBC Sports' operations and all other studio programs moved from the network's New York City headquarters to a new facility in Stamford, Connecticut. 2014 Football Night in America joined the other NBC Sports studio programs at the new NBC Sports Headquarters in Stamford, where an entirely new set for the program was introduced with the debut of the program's ninth season on September 7, 2014, replacing the original set that had been used since the program's 2006 debut. In addition, Kia Motors replaced Hyundai (both automakers are owned by Hyundai Motor Group) as the sponsor for the program's Sunday Night Kickoff segment. Then-recently added NBC Sports correspondent Josh Elliott (formerly of ESPN and later, ABC's Good Morning America) also joined the FNIA broadcast team that year. Elliott would leave NBC Sports to join the network's sister news division in March of the following year. =Super Bowl XLIX= On February 1, 2015, NBC aired a five-hour Super Bowl XLIX pre-game telecast starting at 1:00 p.m. ET, hosted by Bob Costas and Dan Patrick, who also emceed the halftime and post-game shows; Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison once again served as the co-hosts and lead studio analysts, along with guest analyst John Harbaugh. 2015 The \\"4 Downs\\" segment was added as the final segment of FNIA before ending with Costas at the game site. 2016 Other than Mike Tirico joining FNIA to alternate pregame hosting duties with Bob Costas at the SNF game site, the format remained virtually unchanged as all commentators returned to the show from the previous season. 2017 Mike Tirico became the new host of the program from the SNF game site, replacing Bob Costas. Also, the format remained virtually unchanged as all of the other in-studio commentators (Patrick, Harrison and Dungy) returned from the previous season. =Super Bowl LII= On February 4, 2018, NBC aired a six-hour pregame show from Minneapolis, the host city of Super Bowl LII, starting at noon ET (11am CT), hosted by Patrick, Dungy and Harrison, the latter two also served as lead analysts. Liam McHugh, who had previously hosted the NBC-produced Thursday Night Football pregame show during parts of the 2017 NFL season, filled in for Tirico at the game site while the latter was in PyeongChang, South Korea preparing for the network's Winter Olympics coverage (which began just four nights later, on February 8, 2018). Patrick also hosted the halftime and postgame shows. 2018 For the 2018 season, Mike Tirico moved to NBC Sports HQ in Stamford to be the new studio host for the show, replacing Dan Patrick. Tirico is joined in studio by returning analysts Rodney Harrison and Tony Dungy. Liam McHugh took over Tirico's previous role at the SNF game site. The show now ends with Sunday Night Football game picks by Tirico, Harrison, Dungy, Florio, and Chris Simms. McHugh also makes a pick, however, because he is at the game site, Tirico announces his pick for him. 2019 The format remained virtually unchanged as all of the in-studio commentators returned from the previous season. However, the only significant change from the previous season is that Liam McHugh now makes his game pick on camera from the game site. Wild Card Saturday Prior to the Wild Card Saturday doubleheader, a half-hour version of Football Night in America is broadcast featuring an in-depth preview of the first game; during the afternoon halftime, a special edition of the Sunday Night Football halftime show is also broadcast. After the conclusion of the afternoon game and before the kickoff of the night game, an edition known in 2007 as the Diet Pepsi Bridge Show aired. At that point, the format became very similar to the traditional Football Night in America broadcasts, with Faith Hill singing a special playoff version of the intro, Al Michaels and John Madden working the booth, and Keith Olbermann doing a segment during halftime. In addition, until Madden's 2009 retirement, a \\"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\\" was named awarding the MVP for the nighttime game. In 2009, the Wild Card edition of the pre-game was retitled the NFL on NBC Studio Show. =2000s= 2006‚Äì2008 seasons For the 2006 Wild Card coverage, Jim L. Mora appeared as co-host in place of Cris Collinsworth. In 2007, Miami Dolphins player Jason Taylor filled in for Collinsworth in the player's room, as Collinsworth was in Seattle, serving as a commentator for the afternoon game with Tom Hammond. Matt Millen made his first public appearance in Collinsworth's seat for the network's 2008 Wild Card coverage, after being fired by the Detroit Lions. Barber did not appear as he was assigned as the sideline reporter for the early game. 2010s =2011 season= Bob Costas hosted the pre-game from New Orleans, while Charles Barkley ‚Äì who was at 30 Rock to host that evening's episode of Saturday Night Live, which taped next door at Studio 8H ‚Äì sat in with Patrick, Dungy and Harrison in New York City. =2014 and beyond= NBC renegotiated its contract with the NFL following the 2013 season and ceded one of its two Wild Card Saturday playoff games in order to obtain rights to one of the Saturday playoff games in the Divisional Playoffs. This guarantees NBC at least two games per playoff year, with the network airing a wild card matchup, and a second round playoff game which alternates conferences each year. These playoff games under the 2014 contract have aired at 1:00 pm EST, 4:30 pm EST, and NBC's usual 8:30 pm EST. However beginning with the 2016-17 NFL playoffs, 1:00 pm playoff games have been eliminated by the league, at first nominally due to weather, but announced as permanent a week later. Theme music Starting in 2018, NBC implemented an opening, similar to the opening that kicks off SNF. The song used is ‚ÄúCheck it Out‚Äù by Oh the Larceny. The open features NFL players like: the Vikings‚Äô Stefon Diggs & Anthony Barr, the Cowboys‚Äô Dak Prescott, the Rams‚Äô Todd Gurley & Jared Goff, the Falcons‚Äô Julio Jones, and the Seahawks‚Äô Russell Wilson. Some of the players‚Äô actions during the open were taken from when NBC had a share of Thursday Night Football In 2016 and 2017. The theme was retained for 2019 with new players being added like Baker Mayfield of the Browns. Thursday night games Football Night in America was also used as the pre-game show for NBC- produced Thursday Night Football games in 2016 and 2017, though with a slightly varying format due to it being that week's first game, and America in the title substituted with the name of the host city/region of that night's game (A Vikings home game would have that edition of the pre-game titled Football Night in Minnesota, for instance). Personalities For the program's inaugural season in 2006, Bob Costas served as the host, with Cris Collinsworth, Sterling Sharpe and Jerome Bettis as analysts, and Sports Illustrated columnist Peter King as the special \\"insider\\" reporter. On September 7, 2006, Jerome Bettis arrived on the exterior set in a school bus (a reference to his nickname as a player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, \\"The Bus\\"); that night, in addition to providing analysis, Bettis received his ring for winning Super Bowl XL. Bettis missed the December 3 broadcast to prepare for the funeral of his father, Johnnie, who had died of a heart attack the previous Tuesday. NFL Network analyst Marshall Faulk (who at the time was technically still an active player in the NFL, although the St. Louis Rams eventually cut him after a series of injuries) substituted for Bettis that week. At the end of the 2006 season, Sharpe's contract was apparently terminated, and former New York Giants running back Tiki Barber replaced him in 2007. Keith Olbermann, then host of MSNBC's Countdown, was named as another co-host. In addition, Costas and Collinsworth hosted the halftime show for the Georgia Tech‚ÄìNotre Dame game on September 1, 2007; this turned out to be a one-shot promotional appearance. =Current= * Cris Collinsworth ‚Äì studio co-host and analyst (2006‚Äì2009), on-site co-host/color commentary (2009‚Äìpresent) * Jac Collinsworth ‚Äì fill-in studio host (2020-present) * Tony Dungy ‚Äì studio analyst (2009‚Äìpresent) * Mike Florio ‚Äì NFL insider (2010‚Äìpresent) * Rodney Harrison ‚Äì studio analyst (2009‚Äìpresent) * Terry McAulay ‚Äì rules analyst (2018‚Äìpresent) * Liam McHugh ‚Äì on‚Äìsite host (2018‚Äìpresent) * Al Michaels ‚Äì play-by-play (2006‚Äìpresent) * Michele Tafoya ‚Äì sideline reporter (2011‚Äìpresent) * Mike Tirico ‚Äì fill in on-site host/fill in play-by-play (2016), on‚Äìsite host (2017), studio host (2018‚Äìpresent) * Chris Simms ‚Äì studio analyst (2017‚Äìpresent) =Former= * Tiki Barber ‚Äì studio analyst (2007‚Äì2009), on-site reporter (2009‚Äì2010) * Jerome Bettis ‚Äì studio analyst (2006‚Äì2009) * Bob Costas ‚Äì studio host (2006‚Äì2008), on-site host (2009‚Äì2016), contributor (2017) * Josh Elliott ‚Äì contributor (2014) * Peter King ‚Äì NFL insider/contributor (2006‚Äì2016) * Andrea Kremer ‚Äì sideline reporter (2006‚Äì2010) * John Madden ‚Äì color commentary (2006‚Äì2009) * Keith Olbermann ‚Äì studio co-host (2007‚Äì2010) * Dan Patrick - studio host (2008‚Äì2017) * Scott Pioli ‚Äì contributor (2013) * Sterling Sharpe ‚Äì studio analyst (2006) * Hines Ward ‚Äì on-site analyst (2012‚Äì2015) Nielsen ratings For the 2013 season (from September 23 to December 15, 2013), Football Night in America averaged 4.123 million viewers between 7:00 and 7:29 p.m. Eastern Time; 4.960 million between 7:30 and 7:58 p.m. Eastern and 11.677 million between 8:00 and 8:22 p.m. Eastern.

It was designed by architects Eschweiler & Eschweiler and completed in 1930 using differing materials on the exterior to graduate from dark to light.  Description  Art-deco architectural details from the 1930 Milwaukee Gas Light Building Locally distinct light colored brick called Cream City brick crowns the high- rise. Copper panels adorn the spandrels, while organic foliage patterns and terracotta designs decorate the fa√ßade. The building stands 250 feet tall and has 20 floors. Demolished to make room for the building in 1930, a Prohibition-era speakeasy was formerly on the site. Wisconsin Gas was purchased by Wisconsin Energy in 2001. During the consolidation of Wisconsin Gas into Wisconsin Energy's neighboring downtown corporate headquarters, the Wisconsin Gas Building was sold to a developer in 2004 who converted it into leased office space.  Weather flame  A weather beacon shaped as a natural gas flame was added to the top of the Wisconsin Gas Building in 1956. It indicates the weather forecast by its color and flicker. The flame was turned off in 1973 because of that year's energy crisis. It was turned on again in 1985. The flame stands 21 feet tall and weighs four tons. In 2013, the neon tube lighting system was replaced with an LED lighting system. The new LED system allows millions of colors and various other lighting schemes outside the traditional red-gold-blue system, including charity efforts and sports team colors. There is a rhyme created to help remember the colors. Most of the rhyme is consistent, with variations in the final line: :When the flame is red, it's warm weather ahead. :When the flame is gold, watch out for cold. :When the flame is blue, there's no change in view. :When there's a flickering flame, expect snow or rain! and :When the flame is red, warm weather is ahead. :When the flame is gold, watch out for cold. :When the flame is blue, there's no change in view. :Where there's agitation, expect precipitation. The light has been used as a harbor marker and navigation aid by mariners in Lake Michigan over the years.

Dozens of NPC plaques invite visitors to pause on their journey. The Niagara Parks Commission, commonly shortened to Niagara Parks, is an agency of the Government of Ontario which maintains the Ontario shoreline of the Niagara River.  History  The Commission was founded in 1885 and charged with preserving and enhancing the natural beauty of Niagara Falls and the Niagara River corridor as a public greenspace and environmental heritage. The first commissioner was Casimir Gzowski. Other notable Commissioners have included Thomas McQuesten and James Allan. Current Commission Chair is Sandie Bellows, who was appointed in 2019.  Activity  In total, the Commission is in charge of about of parkland along the river, in addition to the Niagara Parkway which spans . In this corridor, the NPC manages numerous trails, historic sites, picnic areas, and attractions. The Commission formerly managed Navy Island National Historic Site under a lease agreement with the Parks Canada. Niagara Parks also operated the People Mover, a shuttle bus system intended to aid transportation along the Niagara River and help reduce automobile crowding near the Falls. The buses were powered by propane and included a trailer unit during most popular hours. In the long term, the Commission is planning for a fixed track transit system along the Niagara Parkway, although no decision has been taken on the exact technology to be used. In the meantime, the Commission joined forces with Niagara Falls Transit to launch the fully accessible WEGO bus system in 2012, and in the process discontinued the People Mover service. =Sites and attractions managed by the Commission= * Chippawa Battlefield Park: site of the Battle of Chippawa in the War of 1812 and a National Historic Site * Dufferin Islands * Falls Incline Railway: funicular railway connecting Table Rock Welcome Centre to the hotels in the Fallsview Tourist Area * Hornblower Niagara Cruises: boat trips along the Niagara River to the Bridal Veil and Horseshoe Falls (formerly operated by Maid of the Mist), operated under contract by Hornblower Cruises * Laura Secord Homestead: historic home of Laura Secord, a heroine of the War of 1812, and a National Historic Site * Mackenzie Printery: printing museum located in the home of historic politician and journalist William Lyon Mackenzie, leader of the Upper Canada Rebellion * McFarland House * Niagara Glen Nature Reserve * Niagara Parks School of Horticulture: a world-renowned training centre for horticulturalists and gardeners ** Niagara Parks Botanical Gardens ** Niagara Parks Butterfly Conservatory * Oak Hall: historic home of mining tycoon Harry Oakes, now partially open as a museum and partially used for NPC offices * Old Fort Erie: historic British fort and a National Historic Site * Queen Victoria Park * Queenston Floral Clock * Table Rock Welcome Centre: visitor's centre in Niagara Falls with observation decks, restaurants, and shopping areas ** Journey Behind the Falls: tourist attraction consisting of tunnels and observation platforms adjacent to and behind the Horseshoe Falls * Whirlpool Aero Car: a scenic cable car ride which crosses over the Niagara Whirlpool Niagara Heritage Trail The Niagara Heritage Trail is a historic and scenic route running the entire 35 mile Canadian coastline of the Niagara River from Fort Erie northward to Niagara-on-the-Lake.

Biography Yehoshua Glass (later Kenaz) was born in Petah Tikva, in the British Mandate of Palestine, in 1937. During the Second World War, his father worked for the British Army, and for a while the family moved to Haifa. He learned to play the violin. His brother Hilik was born when he was thirteen. He was drafted to the Israel Defense Forces and was sent to a basic training camp for physically unfit soldiers. He then served in the Israeli Intelligence Corps. He changed his last name to Kenaz, after Othniel Ben Kenaz, a Biblical name with a similar sound. He studied Philosophy and Romance languages at the Hebrew University, and French literature at the Sorbonne. He wrote his first story in Paris and sent it to Aharon Amir's Keshet journal under the name of Avi Otniel (literally \\"father of Othniel\\"). He became famous in Israel in 1986 when his novel Infiltration became a best seller. Kenaz died on 12 October 2020 of COVID-19, aged 83. Literary career He translated many French classics into Hebrew, and worked on the editorial staff of the Ha'aretz newspaper. He was awarded the Alterman Prize in 1991, the Newman Prize in 1992, the Agnon Prize (1993), the ACUM Prize (1994) and the Bialik Prize (1995). In 2007, Infiltration was named one of the ten most important books in Israeli history. Four of his novels have been adapted to film: Ahare Hahagim, directed by Amnon Rubinstein, in 1994; Alila (from the novel Returning Lost Lives), directed by Amos Gitai, in 2003; On the Way to the Cats, directed by Jorge Gurvich in 2009; and, Infiltration, directed by Dover Koshashvili, released to critical acclaim at the Jerusalem Film Festival 2010. Kenaz said he was not a Zionist because he did not believe a Jewish state would solve the problem of antisemitism. He supported a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict because he wanted the Hebrew language and culture to be hegemonic and more cultivated in Israel. Published works After the Holidays (1964) is about the disintegration of a family in a small farming community in Palestine during the British Mandate. The Great Woman of the Dreams (1973) depicts the lives of the tenants of a rundown apartment house in Tel Aviv. Musical Moment (1980) is a collection of four stories dealing with themes of the rites of manhood and the disruption of innocence. Infiltration (1986) is the story of a platoon of young recruits with minor physical disabilities during their basic training at an Israeli army camp in the 1950s. The Way to the Cats (1991) tells the story of pensioners in an old-age home, who engage in a pathetic power struggle. Returning Lost Loves (1997) runs several plots in parallel form, sharing common characters. Landscape With Three Trees (2000) is two stories about the changes undergone by the Israeli society from the pre-state days to the present-day era. The sociologist Dafna Hirsch uses Kenaz's 2008 short story, \\"The Black Briefcase\\", to illustrate the culture and performance of Zionist masculinity through the consumption of hummus. =In Hebrew= *After the Holidays (novel), Am Oved, 1964; 1987 [Aharei Ha-Hagim] *The Great Woman of the Dreams (novel), Dvir, 1973 [Ha-Isha Ha-Gedolah Me-Ha-Halomot] *Musical Moment (stories), Hakibbutz Hameuchad/Siman Kriah, *1980;1995 [Moment Musicali] *Infiltration (novel), previously entitled Heart Murmur, Am Oved, 1986 [Hitganvut Yehidim] *On the Way to the Cats (novel), Am Oved, 1991 [Ba-Derech La-Hatulim] *Returning Lost Loves (novel), Am Oved, 1997 [Mahzir Ahavot Kodmot] *Landscape with Three Trees (2 novellas), Am Oved, 2000 (Nof Im Shlosha Etzim) *Between Night and Dawn (novella), Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 2006 [Bein Laila ve-Bein Shashar] =Translated into English=  * References 1937 births 2020 deaths 20th-century Israeli novelists 21st-century Israeli novelists 20th-century translators Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel French‚ÄìHebrew translators Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Israeli novelists Israeli translators University of Paris alumni Recipients of Prime Minister's Prize for Hebrew Literary Works People from Petah Tikva People from Haifa ","title":"Yehoshua Kenaz"},{"id":"3536518","text":"Robert \\"Bobby\\" Zabala Barbers (January 19, 1944 ‚Äì December 25, 2005) was a police officer, Secretary of the Interior and Local Government and Senator of the Philippines. Early life and studies Barbers was born in Surigao City to Felix and Regina Barbers. His grandfather, George Barbieri (later Barbers), was an Italian-American immigrant from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War who married a Surigaonon lady. He spoke Cebuano, Tagalog, English, and his native Surigaonon. Barbers studied at the Surigao Elementary School and finished in 1955. He graduated as valedictorian at Surigao High School in 1959. He studied Political Science at Silliman University but completed his degree in 1981 at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, where he also earned his Bachelor of Laws in 1985.\\"Robert Barbers\\". Makati Business Club. Retrieved 2009-12-21. He later went on to earn degrees of Master of Science in Criminology and Master of Science in National Security Administration at the National Defense College in 1992 and 1994. Police career Barbers was encouraged by his uncle, police general and former Vice Mayor of Manila, James Barbers, who was then with the Philippine National Police ‚Äì Western Police District, to join the police force. He was also influenced by his reading of various mystery novels. He passed the examinations for enlistment in the Manila Police Department. In 1975, he became a police sergeant and was assigned in some chartered cities. He was promoted to the rank of Police Officer II in 1981 and to Police officer I in 1983. His highest rank achieved as a member of the Manila police force was colonel; however, he was also Chief of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)'s Police Special Task Force and Inspector of the National Police Commission. Barbers served for 27 years in law enforcement. He participated in \\"the elimination of several notorious drug traffickers\\" while under the auspices of the NBI. His list of accomplishments as a police officer include: adjudged for three consecutive years as one of the Ten Outstanding Policemen of the Philippines (TOPP) from 1986 to 1988; sixteen efficiency medals for solving major crimes; earned promotions for the arrest of drug lord Don \\"Jose Pepe\\" Oyson and rebel leaders Col. Billy Bibit and Ignacio Capegsan; awarded the medals of merit and gallantry and given commendations and letters from the U.S. State Department and various other embassies; and was the only Filipino Golden Service Awardee for Outstanding Law Enforcer in Asia, which was awarded in New York in 1991. Congressman Barbers entered the political arena in 1992 as a member of the House of Representatives representing the 2nd District of Surigao del Norte. He was recognized and acclaimed for his outstanding performance as a legislator by various institutions and organizations, including the Consumer Welfare Foundation of the Philippines, University of the Philippines, Gladiator Magazine, Pilipino Newsline, the Consumer‚Äôs Union of the Philippines (PICC) and the National Defense College of the Philippines. The Mindanao congressman was re-elected in 1995 unopposed. Secretary of Interior and Local Government During Barbers's second term, he was appointed by President Fidel Ramos as Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government in 1996. As a member of the Cabinet, Barbers remained active in his campaign against criminality with his founding of the Public Assistance and Reaction Against Crime (PARAC). It was during his stint as Interior Chief that he intensified his campaign against illegal drugs. He established the Bring-A-Friend Project, which worked for the voluntary submission of drug dependents for rehabilitation. It was also during his tenure as Interior and Local Government Secretary when he founded the Barangay at Pulisya Laban sa Krimen (BPLK) Program whose main purpose was to enlist the cooperation and active participation of the civilian population in the fight against criminality. Barbers was named by the Social Weather Station (SWS) survey as the most effective, most efficient, and most popular Cabinet member of the Ramos administration five consecutive times. Senator Barbers was encouraged by Ramos to run in the 1998 elections as a Senator under the Lakas NUCD Party. During the campaign, Barbers was deemed as one of the \\"sure win\\" candidates for the Senate. The Mindanao congressman ranked fifth among the elected Senators in terms of votes received, and became the first police officer who became a member of the Philippine Senate. (Panfilo \\"Ping\\" Lacson, another law enforcement official who was Director General and head of the Presidential Anti Organized Crime Task Force or PAOCT-F, later became a Senator as well, in 2001-2002.) As chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Illegal Drugs, Barbers continued to focus on fighting criminality, injustice, and illegal drugs, which he considered as the number one enemy of the people. He authored more than a hundred bills and resolutions, the majority of which were aimed at improving the peace and order situation and uplifting the living conditions of Filipinos. Barbers also drafted an anti- terrorism bill as a Senator. In November 2000, Barbers was diagnosed with a throat problem and was later flown to the United States. He was the lone senator absent during the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada. When he returned to the Philippines in February 2001, the impeachment trial was over and Estrada was ousted by the second EDSA People Power Revolution. After the 2001 elections, Barbers authored the law creating the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. He was instrumental in the crafting of other laws that increased penalties for \\"jueteng\\" protectors and operators and strengthened the anti-drugs campaign, such as including possession of 10 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride as a nonbailable offense. Barbers was a strong advocate of the death penalty for capital offenders. 2004 elections In the 2004 elections, Barbers ran for reelection as senator under the Lakas CMD banner, but lost. He filed an election protest against Senator Rodolfo Biazon to contest the 12th slot, accusing the Commission on Elections of haste in proclaiming the latter's victory and demanding that the poll body await the election results in his strongholds in Mindanao. His petition was eventually denied. Barbers's name was also mentioned in the controversial \\"Hello Garci\\" tapes. Transcripts of the tapes showed Barbers calling then Election Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano to ensure his victory in the 2004 elections. Personal life Bobby, as Barbers was known to many, was married to Virginia Smith. They had four children, three of whom are sons also named Robert. Robert \\"Ace\\" Barbers is the representative of the 2nd district of Surigao del Norte who previously served as governor the same province. Robert Dean Barbers was the Director of the Philippine Tourism Authority and was once a city councilor of Makati. Robert Lyndon Barbers was also a Provincial Governor of Surigao del Norte. Mary Grace Barbers was working in the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) at the time of her father's death. Barbers was a pious devotee of the Santo Ni√±o, as evidenced by the various icons of the child Christ which adorned his office. He credited the Santo Ni√±o for every success, including the criminal cases he had solved and all his electoral victories. Because of his devotion to the child Christ, and for being a law enforcer, Barbers came up with a Santo Ni√±o image dressed in police uniform, which came to be known as the Sto. Ni√±o de Policia. Barbers was twice considered for the position of vice president in the ticket of then presidential candidate de Venecia in 1998, and again in 2004 after Arroyo considered him following her ascension to the presidency after the ouster of Joseph Estrada. His life was put into film starring Phillip Salvador, Willie Revillame, Herbert Bautista, John Regala and Jeffrey Santos. Death Barbers died at 10:29 a.m., on Christmas Day, 2005, at The Medical City Hospital in Pasig City; although he had throat cancer, the cause of death was heart failure. He was buried at the Manila Memorial Park in Para√±aque. In popular culture *Portrayed by Phillip Salvador in the 1997 film Bobby Barbers: Parak.

Founded in 1944, it closed in July 2010. Wesley was a conservative Bible college in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition. Wesley was founded by the Congregational Methodist Church and served as that denomination's sole institution of higher education. Wesley offered programs of study in three academic divisions leading to Bachelor's degrees, and program certificates. Academic programs available at Wesley included bachelor's programs in Biblical Literature, Christian Education, Missions, Pastoral Ministries, Christian Counseling, and certificate programs in General Education, and Ministerial Studies. History In 1905, the Congregational Methodist Church founded its first college, \\"Atlanta Bible College.\\" In 1912, financial difficulties and internal problems forced the closing of ABC. In 1944 the college was reborn as \\"Dallas Bible School,\\" with Otho Jennings named the first superintendent. In August of the same year, W.E. Bruce was tabbed to replace Jennings, and would hold the position until 1953. In 1953 the Congregational Methodist Church acquired Westminster College in Tehuacana, Texas from the Methodist Protestant Church and relocated DBS there, adopting the Westminster name. In 1972, property was acquired in Florence, Mississippi and the college was relocated to newly constructed facilities. In 1976 the name was changed from Westminster to Wesley College, a name more in keeping with the College's Wesleyan/Arminian Tradition. The school closed in July 2010. Campus Wesley had a campus of approximately . There were five buildings, including the main academic building, men's and women's dormitories, the gymnasium (home to the Wesley Warriors of the NCCAA), and the College library, which was housed in the Congregational Methodist Headquarters building. The center of the campus was marked by a quadrangle featuring a large gazebo where students were routinely seen studying or lounging. Athletics Wesley's athletic teams were known as the Wesley Warriors.

Early years Yepremian was born in Larnaca, Cyprus to Armenian parents. Yepremian and his brother, Krikor, who attended Indiana University on a soccer scholarship, immigrated to the United States. Yepremian, who had earlier played in an organized soccer league in London, was not eligible to play NCAA football. After watching some of a football game on television, he decided to pursue an NFL career. With Krikor acting as his agent, he earned a contract with the Detroit Lions. Professional career Yepremian signed with the Detroit Lions on October 13, 1966. In his rookie year, he broke an American football record by kicking six field goals in a single game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 13. His talent aside, Yepremian was, nonetheless, at a loss regarding football vernacular and custom. In his first game his coach told him that their team had lost the coin toss, at which point Yepremian ran to midfield and dropped to his knees looking for the coin. Yepremian was an immediate target to NFL players who considered American football the exclusive realm of Americans. Players were looking to take Yepremian's head off, and before his first kickoff his coach told him to run to the bench as soon as he kicked before his opponents could lay into him. Yepremian kicked off, then in a harried state ran to the wrong bench, finding himself sitting with the opposing team. Yepremian had never worn a helmet and at first decided not to use one with a face mask, but that changed during Week 4 of the 1966 season, when he was knocked to the ground and badly injured by Green Bay Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke. Afterwards, he started using a single-bar mask. He was the last player in the NFL to not wear a facemask on his helmet.http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/6628/face-of-the-nfl- is-gone-an-ode-to-the-single-bar During one of his early games with the Lions, they were losing but scored a touchdown in the last 10 seconds of the game. Yepremian was sent in to kick the extra point, and he was so excited after converting the point that he went running off the field with his arms raised in celebration. Teammate Alex Karras asked Yepremian, \\"What the hell are you celebrating?\\" Yepremian replied with a phrase made famous on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson: \\"I keek a touchdown\\". After the 1967 season, Yepremian left football to enlist in the U.S. Army. When he returned to the Detroit area in 1968, however, the Lions chose not to re-sign him, so Yepremian signed a contract to be a kicker/punter for the Michigan Arrows of the Continental Football League.http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami- dolphins/article21153423.html The Arrows, however, were a disaster on the field (1-11) and at the gate (drawing barely 4,000 fans a game in Detroit) and folded at season's end. After sitting out the 1969 season, Yepremian earned a spot on the Dolphins roster in 1970. He led the NFL with 117 points in 1971, and in Super Bowl VI, he scored the only 3 Dolphin points vs the Cowboys. The next year, Garo was a key member of the 1972 Miami Dolphins \\"Perfect Season\\" team - he was the leading scorer and converted on many clutch field goals to help the Dolphins stay unbeaten. Yepremian appeared in three Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII). Yepremian went to the New Orleans Saints for the 1979 season. In 14 games, he made 12 of 16 attempts, with his longest being from 44 yards. He spent his final two years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He made 16 of 23 for 1980, his lowest field goal rate since making only 45% in 1977. For 1981, he went 2 for 4 to end his career as he was replaced by Bill Capece. Over his career, Yepremian was successful on 210 of 313 field goals and 444 of 464 extra points for a total of 1,074 points. He led the league in field-goal accuracy three times. Garo is the only first-team members of the 1970s NFL All-Decade team to not be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. =Highlights: Super Bowl VII= Yepremian is best known for two feats ‚Äî one famous and one infamous. In a divisional playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas 1971, he kicked a 37-yard field goal 7 minutes and 40 seconds into double overtime, ending the longest game in NFL history and sending the Dolphins to the AFC Championship game against the Baltimore Colts (which the Dolphins won to go on to Super Bowl VI). Despite all of Yepremian's success, many people remember him for an incident in Super Bowl VII in 1973. With his team leading the Washington Redskins 14-0, Yepremian was sent on to the field to kick a field goal with slightly more than two minutes left, which would have put the game out of reach. The field goal attempt was blocked by Bill Brundige, and Yepremian managed to get to the ball before any other player did. Instead of just falling on the ball to preserve the Dolphins' 14-0 lead, he picked it up and frantically attempted to throw a pass. The ball slipped from his hands and went straight up in the air. Yepremian then attempted to bat the ball out of bounds but instead batted it back up in the air, and it went right into the arms of his former Lions teammate, Redskins cornerback Mike Bass, who returned it for a touchdown. The Dolphins managed to hold on to win, 14-7, thus completing the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season. Yepremian later joked to reporters after the game, \\"This is the first time the goat of the game is in the winner's locker room.\\" In the 1973 Pro Bowl, Yepremian kicked five field goals to lead the AFC to a win, and was voted Most Valuable Player in that game. He was elected to another Pro Bowl in 1978, and he kicked 20 consecutive field goals without a miss in 1979.

History Singer and bassist Matt McCourt formed the band in 1982 under the name Evil Genius. In the same year, he recorded a demo in the Ace Tunnel Sound studio in Portland, Oregon, United States, with musicians Dave Koening, Chon Carter and Kip Doran featuring three tracks. After several line-up changes, another demo with the title Evil Genius was recorded, which was later released as Dr. Mastermind Must Die! under the original band name Evil Genius. With this line-up the band played several local shows, before they split up again after not receiving contract offers by music labels. After sending the Evil Genius demo to Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records, McCourt was offered a contract with the label, under the condition that he found a drummer for the band, which he found in Deen Castronovo, who he had already played with before in Wild Dogs. On guitar, they found Kurt James. Shortly before the album Dr. Mastermind was released in 1986, the band was renamed to Mastermind after being urged to do so by their label. Shortly after, the name was changed again, this time to Dr. Mastermind, after another band called Mastermind threatened to sue them. The first tracks for the album were recorded at Cascade studio in Portland, Oregon. The mixing and mastering took place at Prairie Sun studios in Cotati, California. After the release of Dr. Mastermind, Castronovo, James and session guitarist Ronn Chick left the band. From this point on, the band primarily consisted only of McCourt, who in the following years released a DVD and a few compilations on his own label US Metal Records. During the early 2000s, he re-released the Dr. Mastermind album with additional live recordings and the song \\"Evil Seed\\".

(It is sometimes identified with Fintan mac B√≥chra, who was known as \\"The Wise\\" and was once transformed into a salmon.) Fenian Cycle The Salmon story figures prominently in The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn, which recounts the early adventures of Fionn mac Cumhaill. According to the story, an ordinary salmon ate nine hazelnuts that fell into the Well of Wisdom (an Tobar Segais) from nine hazel trees that surrounded the well. By this act, the salmon gained all the world's knowledge. The first person to eat of its flesh would in turn gain this knowledge. The poet Finn Eces (or Finegas) spent seven years fishing for this salmon. Finally Finn caught the salmon and gave the fish to Fionn, his servant and son of Cumhaill, with instructions to cook it but on no account to eat any of it. Fionn cooked the salmon, turning it over and over, but when he touched the fish with his thumb to see if it was cooked, he burnt his finger on a drop of hot cooking fish fat. Fionn sucked on his burned finger to ease the pain. Little did Fionn know that all of the salmon's wisdom had been concentrated into that one drop of fish fat. When he brought the cooked meal to Finn Eces, his master saw that the boy's eyes shone with a previously unseen wisdom. Finn Eces asked Fionn if he had eaten any of the salmon. Answering no, the boy explained what had happened. Finn Eces realized that Fionn had received the wisdom of the salmon, so gave him the rest of the fish to eat. Fionn ate the salmon and in so doing gained all the knowledge of the world. Throughout the rest of his life, Fionn could draw upon this knowledge merely by biting his thumb. The deep knowledge and wisdom gained from the Salmon of Knowledge, allowed Fionn to become the leader of the Fianna, the famed heroes of Irish myth.  Related mythologies  In Irish mythology, several primordial beings that personify old age and ancient knowledge are described as taking the shape of a salmon. Most notably, this includes Fintan mac B√≥chra and Tuan mac Cairill. The Welsh Hanes Taliesin (16th c.) records a similar story of how the poet Taliesin received his wisdom, that also involves the element of shape-shifting into the form of a fish, resp., an otter. In the Icelandic Volsunga Saga (late 13th century), several motifs recur, as well: Odin, Loki, and H≈ìnir slew an otter that they later found to be the son of the dwarf Hreidmar. The treasure Hreidmar was receiving as ransom was then protected by his son Fafnir, who took the shape of a serpent or dragon. On behalf of his brother Regin, Fafnir was later slain by Sigurd. Regin asked Sigurd to cook Fafnir's heart for him to eat, but, like Fionn, Sigurd tasted it and gained the knowledge of the speech of birds. Thus he learnt about Regin's treachery and confronted him. Similarly, Saxo Grammaticus (Gesta Danorum, V.2.6-V.2.8, 12th c.) describes how Eric acquired eloquence and wisdom by eating the snake-infested stew his step-mother Kraka had prepared for his half-brother Roller. The motif is well-known in European fairy tales and corresponds to Aarne‚ÄìThompson type 673 (KHM 17, see The White Serpent's flesh), frequently found in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in Scotland, Ireland, Scandinavia, in the Baltic countries and occasionally also outside Europe. As both the majority of fairy tales and the Germanic versions point to a serpent being digested, but not a salmon, it seems likely that the salmon is a substitute for an original serpent. In popular culture Close- up view of scales on The Big Fish or Salmon of Knowledge sculpture in Belfast In 1999, in celebration of the return of fish to the River Lagan, the city of Belfast erected a sculpture titled The Salmon of Knowledge but locally called The Big Fish.Each tile used to make the sculpture references part of Belfast's history. If following the local folklore, wisdom can still be gained by kissing the sculpture of The Salmon of Knowledge today.

They are commonly called bellworts, bellflowers or merrybells. The genus name is derived from the Latin ≈´vula meaning \\"little grape,\\" likely because of the way the flowers hang downward. For the same reason Uvularia may also refer to the similarly derived palatine uvula, which hangs down from the soft palate in the mouth. The plants are often found growing on wooded slopes or in ravines and they spread by stolons, or stoloniferous rhizomes. The plants are usually in height and bear one or two flowers per stem in April and May, that hang downward from the axils of the leaves.  Species  There are five species of Uvularia. All are exclusively native (endemic) to North America.

IMO number: 9271054. She should not be confused with a namesake ship, the USCGC Mackinaw (WAGB-83), IMO number 6119534, which was decommissioned on June 10, 2006. Background Mackinaw was delivered to the Coast Guard on November 18, 2005 and commissioned on June 10, 2006. In addition to her ice- breaking duties, the Mackinaw will also serve as an Aids to Navigation ship, able to perform the same duties as the Seagoing Buoy Tenders (WLB) of the Coast Guard fleet. Further, she can conduct law enforcement and search and rescue missions and can deploy an oil skimming system to respond to oil spill situations and environmental response. Mechanical specifications Mackinaw's Main Control Console, which is used to steer the ship instead of a steering wheel. One of the Mackinaw's unique features in the US Coast Guard fleet is the use of two Azipod units, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters, for her main propulsion. These, coupled with a bow thruster, make the ship exceptionally maneuverable. The Azipod units also remove the need for a traditional rudder, as the thrusters can turn 360 degrees around their vertical axis to direct their thrust in any direction. The Mackinaw also lacks a traditional ship's steering wheel. Much of the ship‚Äôs technology, including the Azipod thrusters, is from Finnish Maritime Cluster. Additionally, the Mackinaw can continuously proceed through fresh water ice up to 32 inches (81 cm) thick at 3 knots or 14 inches (36 cm) at 10 knots. She can also break smooth, continuous ice up to 42 inches (107 cm) thick through ramming. History The Mackinaw got off to a rocky start before being commissioned. While en route to her new home port of Cheboygan, Michigan, the Mackinaw struck a seawall in Grand Haven, Michigan on December 12, 2005. The accident caused a dent in the bow of the Mackinaw on her starboard side. Shortly after the accident, Captain Donald Triner, the commanding officer of the Mackinaw, was temporarily relieved of duty pending an investigation into the accident. The accident did not delay the ship's scheduled arrival in her new home port; she arrived on December 17, 2005. Captain Triner was later permanently relieved of duty and replaced by Captain Michael Hudson, who was replaced in turn by Commander John Little in April 2006. CDR Scott J. Smith assumed command in July 2008 and was relieved by CDR Michael J. Davanzo in Aug, 2011. In June 2014, CDR Vasilios Tasikas assumed command. In June 2017, CDR John Stone assumed command. In June 2020, CDR Kristen Serumgard assumed command. The Mackinaw is stationed at Cheboygan, Michigan. It can be seen and toured at Grand Haven's Coast Guard Festival every summer. The ship was also featured on the television series Modern Marvels. Katmai Bay, stationed at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, helps the in ice breaking duties.

The SPG directly supports police in high-risk incidents such as sieges with specialised tactical, negotiation, intelligence and command-support services. The unit also provides rescue and bomb disposal support, canine policing, and armoury services. History Established in June 1991, the State Protection Group replaced four former specialist units; the Special Weapons and Operations Section (SWOS), the Witness Security Unit, regional Tactical Response Groups and the Police Rescue Squad. Later other sections were also added to the command including the Police Armoury, Negotiation section, Bomb disposal and Dog Unit. In recent years the Witness Security Unit was moved from the State Protection Group to the Anti Terrorism & Security Group. Roles * Resolving siege and hostage situations, as well as armed offender situations; * Providing a negotiation service in high risk and critical situations; * Undertaking searches of premises in high risk situations; * The arrest of armed and dangerous offenders; * Escorting and securing dangerous prisoners in high risk situations; * Providing support services for major operations; * Rescue and bomb disposal operations; * Counter-terrorism and hijacking operations; * The escort and security of VIPs, internationally protected persons, Heads of State; and * Providing specialist engineering services and supply of ammunition and firearms for the NSW Police Force through the Armoury. Mission \\"To provide extraordinary services to operational police in rescue, bomb disposal, high risk resolution, negotiation, specialised dog unit and Armoury services.\\" Organisation The SPG currently consists of the following sections: *Tactical Operations Unit (TOU) *Tactical Operations Regional Support (TORS) *Negotiation Unit *Intelligence Unit *Police Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit *Dog Unit =Tactical Operations Unit (TOU)= Dodge Ram rescue vehicle. Since 1978, the Australian Government's National Counter-Terrorism Plan has required each state police force to maintain a specialist counter-terrorist and hostage-rescue unit (Police Tactical Group, aka police tactical unit). The unit that now fulfills that role, the Tactical Operations Unit, has undergone a number of changes over the years. Since 1945 the New South Wales Police Force has maintained a team of tactical police available for specialist operations with the creation of the 'Riot Squad' which consisted of a number detectives from '21 Division' to counter the number of armed hold ups that occurred after World War II. Over the following years it became known as the 'Emergency Squad' and in 1977 had its name changed to the 'Special Weapons and Operations Section' (SWOS) with its size and role expanding, including a full-time complement of 27 officers and 400 part-time officers across the State. In 1980 the Tactical Response Group (TRG) was created, becoming operational in May 1982, with units divided into groups of 25 officers across the four metropolitan regions with a primary role of responding to riots, demonstrations, disasters, saturation patrols and to support SWOS at emergency hostage/siege situations. TRG officers were mainly drawn from the ranks of general duties police whereas SWOS were drawn from Detectives sections and branches. In June 1991 both units were rationalised and dissolved with the creation of the Tactical Operations Unit with the aim of resolving high-risk incidents by containment and negotiation, with minimal or judicious use of force to be applied only as a last resort and based on full and careful assessment. Unlike the former SWOS and TRG, the TOU is a completely full-time assignment with a strength of 75 officers and is not responsible for riot control or crowd control situations, which are handled by the Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS). The TOU is available to provide extraordinary assistance to operational police in high-risk incidents such as resolving siege and hostage situations, as well as armed offender situations across the State on a 24-hour basis. The TOU also conducts 'high risk' arrest operations of armed and dangerous offenders such as Ivan Milat, Malcolm Naden, or those involved in firearm incidents such as bikie related shootings. The TOU deals with at least 200 \\"high-risk\\" situations, including siege and hostage scenarios, each year across NSW. The TOU is equipped with 'less- lethal' devices as well as specialist firearms and equipment for 'domestic' and counter-terrorist operations. Members of the TOU are equipped with a wide range of specialist firearms including Heckler & Koch UMP submachine guns and tactical shotguns. The TOU is equipped with a wide range of specialist vehicles including mobile command/support vehicles, armoured Chevrolet vans and two Lenco BearCat armoured Ford F550s. As stated earlier the Tactical Operations Unit does have a more wide range of firearms and tactical equipment to choose from. The standard sidearm is the Glock Model 22 (Glock 22) .40 S&W; pistol usually carried in a Safariland 6280 Holster that can accept the Glock with a tactical light attached.

Through the 1960s and 1970s the units were known as Emergency Squads becoming known as Country/Regional SWOS in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With the creation of the Tactical Operations Unit in 1991 and dropping of the name SWOS the units became known as State Protection Support Unit (SPSU). 2018, the SPSU was renamed to Tactical Operations Regional Support (TORS). TORS provides specialist support to the Tactical Operations Unit in resolving high-risk incidents in regional New South Wales. The various TORS Units across the State are involved in approximately 60 'high risk' operations per year. Comprising part-time tactical operatives from non- metropolitan areas, TORS consists of police whose primary duties cover a wide range of activities including general duties, highway patrol, detectives and weapons training. The types of operations that they can be called upon to undertake include containing siege and armed offender situations; resolving siege and hostage situations; arresting armed and dangerous offenders, often in high-risk situations; conducting high-risk searches of premises; escorting and providing security for internationally protected persons, heads of State and holders of high office who are assessed and determined to be at risk. The unit also provides support services for high-risk major operations. Each year TORS is involved in approximately 60 operations across the State which includes pre-planned operations and the execution of high-risk search warrants. While primarily a regional resource, TORS can be deployed throughout the State to assist the Tactical Operations Unit. Approximately 170 TORS officers are on call across the state under regional command. The TOU is responsible for the initial selection and training of TORS volunteers, followed up by monthly local training and an annual TOU re-certification camp. TORS officers also attend various training camps organised by Tactical Operations Unit to maintain consistency in their training levels. TORS teams are equipped with a range of specialist tactical gear including less than lethal munitions such as Tasers, beanbags as well as various shotguns and M4/M16 Assault rifles. The range of skills TORS operators possess include bushcraft and navigation, close quarter tactics, entry methods, ballistic shield operations, cordon and perimeter operations, advanced weapons training, and less than lethal tactics. =Negotiation Unit= In 1979 the NSW Police ran their first Hostage Negotiator Unit course forming a part-time on call unit. In 1991 with the creation of the SPG the term hostage was dropped due to the variety of call-outs the unit was used for and a small full-time cadre established. At present under the supervision of a small full-time cadre, highly trained negotiators are on call across the state on a part-time, as- needed basis. Negotiators work hand in hand with other units of the State Protection Group in order to resolve incidents peacefully. Roles and tasks *Suicide intervention *Persons with mental health issues *Kidnapping/extortion *Sieges/hostage situations *Barricaded offender situations *Escapees *Warrants ‚Äì search, high-risk warrant execution *Family law matters *Public order management *National counter-terrorism incidents =Intelligence Unit= This unit provides intelligence information to negotiators and other TOU officers involved in high-risk incidents. Such intelligence may include information on people involved (offenders, hostages or suspects), or the provision of plans and photographs of premises. =Police Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit= Police Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit Mercedes Benz Sprinter Originally created in 1942 as the Police Cliff Rescue Squad for the express purpose of recovering the bodies of suicide victims, or rescuing persons trapped on cliffs, the Police Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit has undergone numerous changes and expansions over the years. Apart from responding to 000 (emergency calls) calls, the Police Rescue Unit provides specialist search and rescue support of operational police in situations of any risk category. This support extends from searches for evidence, to working with negotiators at extreme heights. Police Rescue operators are trained to use equipment such as Jaws of Life, metal detectors, trapped person locaters, sophisticated communication equipment and cutting tools etc. These officers are experts in abseiling, climbing, single rope techniques and stretcher escorts with cliff machines. The Units core responsibilities include: * General Rescue, * Specialist Support, * Land Search and Rescue * Bomb Response and Disposal. Some of the Rescue Unit's responsibilities and challenges include: * Rescuing people trapped in difficult high or deep places such as mines, storm-water drains, cliffs, scaffolding and remote places. * Rescuing people involved in industrial, traffic, railway and aircraft accidents or who may have become trapped in household equipment, machinery or playground equipment. * Providing power or lighting in emergencies or for police operations * Rescuing livestock and animals in accidents * Working in toxic or hazardous environments One of several Police Rescue Hino Heavy Rescue units, callsign Rescue 20. In 1993 the Department of Defence handed over bomb disposal responsibilities to the NSW Police Force. The Bomb Disposal section was established within Forensic Services and then in 1997, the section was relocated to the SPG. Prior to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the Bomb Disposal section was amalgamated with the Rescue Unit. The Police Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit is based in Alexandria (Sydney). Decentralized units are based in the Blue Mountains, Newcastle, Goulburn, Bathurst, Lismore and Oak Flats (formerly Wollongong). The mostly part-time decentralized units are responsible for rescue and bomb appraisal operations within their local area and provide specialist support tasks for operational policing that cannot be provided by other units or sections. Established in 2015, the newly formed Western Region Police Rescue Squad comprising general duty officers from Moree, Narrabri, Tamworth, Quirindi, Werris Creek, Armidale and Bourke provides specialist operational support to various police units across the Western Region. The unit was the subject of an Australian ABC television series (1991‚Äì1996) and a 1994 feature film, Police Rescue. The Police Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit celebrated its 75-year anniversary in 2017 with the Blue Mountains Police Rescue Squad its 50th anniversary in 2018. =Rescue Squad Major Involvements= It is estimated that the unit has attended over 300,000 jobs in the past 60 years. The Unit has been involved in some of the States, and Australias, largest incidents including the following: * 1966 Wanda Beach Murders * 1974 Cyclone Tracy * 1977 Granville rail disaster * 1978 Sydney Hilton bombing * 1979 Sydney Ghost Train fire * 1989 Newcastle earthquake * 1989 Kempsey bus crash * 1997 Thredbo landslide * 1999 Glenbrook rail accident * 2003 Waterfall train disaster * 2007 Sydney Harbour ferry/pleasure cruiser crash * 2008 Sydney Harbour boat collision * 2009 British backpacker Jamie Neale search * 2011 Mosman collar bomb incident * 2011 Parramatta Bomb Hoax/Hostage Incident * 2013 New South Wales bushfires * 2014 Sydney Lindt Cafe Hostage Incident. =Dog Unit= More commonly referred to as the 'Dog Squad', the Police Dog Unit was initially created in NSW between 1932 and 1953 and was reintroduced in 1979. The unit was established to support police in locating offenders and missing persons, detecting and detaining fleeing criminals and detecting drugs, firearms and explosives Dogs used for patrol duties are German Shepherds or Rottweilers. The Labrador retriever is the breed of choice for specialist detection for narcotics and explosives, etc. The Unit employs both male and female handlers, most of whom work two dogs. After training, all police dog teams are able to track and find wanted offenders or missing persons, search all types of buildings, detect illicit drugs, and support foot-patrolling of public places to deter crime and make these places safer for the community. The Dog Unit is the largest Dog Unit of any Police Force in Australia and provides specialist dogs for operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week across the State. The Dog Unit has teams based around the State with its main base at Menai and sections at Tweed Heads, Wagga Wagga and Dubbo. Dog Squad officers may be called upon to chase and apprehend offenders who may be escaping arrest and may be armed and dangerous or act as a deterrent and back up in dangerous situations such as brawls, sieges, riots and domestics. They are also used to provide high-profile foot patrols in places such as schools, industrial areas, shopping complexes and during large public events such as New Year's Eve or sporting events, etc. The Dog Unit currently has the following capabilities/specialist dogs: A Dog Squad Falcon R6 * general purpose and * tactical dogs (who work closely with the TOU) *public order * drug detection * firearms, explosives detection * cadaver detection * currency detection *Urban search and rescue (USAR) NSW Police Force general purpose and tactical dogs are also issued their own sets of canine body armour/ballistic vests.

On those nights Night Tracks would end before the entirety of block two had been aired.) Interest in music videos began to wane in the late 1980s. USA Network cancelled its Radio 1990 video program in 1986; MTV suffered a ratings slump that same year that led it to replace its original crew of video jockeys and begin creating non-music programs; and in the summer of 1987, Friday Night Videos was pushed back an hour to accommodate a Friday episode of the higher-rated Late Night with David Letterman. In 1989 TBS began cutting back the amount of airtime devoted to music videos. Beginning in March, 1989, the Friday night schedule comprised one hour of Power Play (see below) and one three-hour block of videos, beginning at 1:00 AM ET/10:00 PM PT. TBS assigned the cut three hours to live sports events on Friday evenings and reruns of Hogan's Heroes and Gomer Pyle early Saturday mornings. That August, TBS reduced Night Tracks to two and a half hours on Friday, and Chartbusters (see below) plus two two-hour blocks on Saturday, while the remaining hours each night were assigned to Night Flicks (which was simply a movie, standard TBS evening fare, with the Night Tracks theme music and announcer introducing the commercial breaks). In the spring of 1990, it was further reduced to two 90 minute blocks. (This meant that it was possible to see the first 90-minute block again (albeit in abbreviated form just before the cut off time) on the same night.) In the spring of 1991, Night Tracks introduced \\"College Crush Groove\\", two 30-minute blocks of alternative music videos in addition to two one-hour blocks of the customary top 40 videos. The next August, Night Tracks became wholly devoted to alternative and rap, adopting the slogan \\"The Music That Matters\\". However, the ratings did not significantly improve. TBS replaced more of Night Tracks airtime with the now- renamed Nite Flix on May 15, 1992 and eventually cancelled Night Tracks altogether. Friday, May 29, 1992 saw the final episode, albeit in an abbreviated 40 minute airing. The only program that aired on the night of Saturday, May 30, 1992 was New Alternative Express. =America's Music Tracks (1983‚Äì1984)= Following Night Tracks success, WTBS launched a one-hour, country music-oriented version with different voiceover announcers (though the same chyron font for music video identification was used). It premiered on Sunday, October 2, 1983 at 8:05 PM Eastern Time/5:05 PM Pacific Time. The show ran for 15 weeks before it was canceled in February 1984. =Chartbusters (1984‚Äì1991)= Chartbusters was an hour-long Top 10 (changed to Top 20 in 1990) music video show countdown that aired on Saturday nights preceding Night Tracks. It premiered on May 19, 1984, and its chart listing was associated with Kal Rudman's Friday Morning Quarterback. The show also aired an additional BREAKER video that was predicted to hit the charts in the following weeks. =Power Play (1985‚Äì1988)= Power Play was an hour of top-ranking music videos that aired on Friday nights preceding Night Tracks. It premiered on October 4, 1985. This brought the total time to a peak of 14 hours of music videos aired each weekend. =Power Play Dancin (1988‚Äì1989)= Power Play Dancin was an hour-long Top 10 dance video block which replaced Power Play. =Power Hits (1989‚Äì1990)= Power Hits was an hour of hard rock music videos which replaced Power Play Dancin. It was canceled in February 1990, and nothing music-related was put in its place. =Night Flicks (1989‚Äì1991) = Night Flicks was a two-hour movie presentation (a different movie on Friday and Saturday) that used the Night Tracks theme music. The name Night Flicks had originated onNight Tracks as a movie trailer commercial segment.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvWeBY90dZk Over time, it replaced most of Night Tracks, and the title was changed to Nite Flix in 1991; under this name, it lasted into 1994.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhgi_o5MhoA =New Alternative Express (1991‚Äì1992)= New Alternative Express was an hour- long Top 10 alternative video block, replacing Chartbusters.

History After the failed Planet Us project with Sammy Hagar did not produce an album, Neal Schon was determined to see the material he had written come to life. According to Schon, \\"I was angry because we had plans and I had done a lot of pre-work. I wrote a lot of songs, about 30 or more, and I had just done a lot of work and put a lot of energy into it. ... A few days later I cooled off and I just re-grouped and got to my senses and I put the pieces of the puzzle back together again with some different guys.\\" Neal Schon '05 interview discusses birth of Soul SirkUS (See the Planet Us article for further history leading to the formation of Soul SirkUS). Schon had heard of the reputation of Soto, mainly due to coverage on the AOR-focused website MelodicRock.com,Jeff Scott Soto '05 interview describes how Neal Schon discovered him which detailed his history with the band Talisman. At the 2004 annual NAMM Show in Los Angeles, Schon met up with Soto and tested the waters with a jam session: \\"Jeff brought his drummer and his bass player down and we sort of sketched out a little set, even though we didn‚Äôt have time to rehearse. We did some Led Zeppelin and Journey songs and we did some Stevie Wonder and some blues. We played a little 45-minute set and the people pretty much went off; they loved it. Immediately, I knew we had some chemistry and that it would work.\\" While in Los Angeles, Schon also attended a showcase featuring Mendoza (known for his work with Whitesnake) and was impressed with his ability. Inviting Soto, Mendoza and Journey's drummer Castronovo to join him, the new band began rehearsing and eventually recorded 11 songs for their debut album, World Play. Although all the foundation tracks on the album were originally written for Planet Us, only one completed song from that band was used for Soul SirkUS' debut. That song was \\"Peephole\\", originally entitled \\"Peeping Through a Hole\\" on the Planet Us version. The rest of the album was developed by Soto who took Schon's lengthy instrumental tracks and \\"chopped them down\\" into songs which he added his vocals to.SoulSirkUS interview with Schon & Soto from Feb. 2005 In early 2005, with a completed album ready (albeit only available online through the Soul SirkUS website) the band was forced to postpone their first tour when Castronovo fell ill due to extreme exhaustion. Soon after, Castronovo bowed out of Soul Sirkus based on his doctor's recommendation Melodicrock.com 2005 Interview with Deen Castronovo and was replaced by Australian drummer Virgil Donati. Schon decided to take advantage of Donati's unique style and remixed the World Play album with Donati's drum tracks while adding five new songs. The updated lineup then embarked on a short but well-received tour of the U.S. and Europe. The remixed World Play album was re-released with new artwork on the European-based Frontiers Records label.

She was a leading figure in the Black Arts Movement and has authored over a dozen books of poetry, as well as short stories, critical essays, plays, and children's books. In the 1960s, Sanchez released poems in periodicals targeted towards African American audiences, and published her debut collection, Homecoming, in 1969. In 1993, she received Pew Fellowship in the Arts, and in 2001 was awarded the Robert Frost Medal for her contributions to the canon of American poetry. She has been influential to other African-American poets, including Krista Franklin. Early life Sanchez was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on September 9, 1934 to Wilson L. Driver and Lena Jones Driver. Her mother died when Sanchez was only one year old, so she spent several years being shuttled back and forth among relatives. One of those was her grandmother, who died when Sanchez was six. The death of her grandmother proved to be a trying time in her life. Though only six, Sanchez suffered from losing her loved one, developing a stutter that contributed to her becoming introverted. However, her stutter only caused her to read more and more and pay close attention to language and its sounds. In 1943, she moved to Harlem to live with her father (the school teacher), her sister, and her stepmother, who was her father's third wife. When in Harlem, she learned to manage her stutter and excelled in school, finding her poetic voice which later emerged during her studies at Hunter College. Sanchez focused on the sound of her poetry, admitting to always reading her poetry aloud, and received praise for her use of the full range of African and African-American vocal resources. She is known for her sonic range and dynamic public readings. She now terms herself as an \\"ordained stutterer.‚Äù Sanchez earned a BA in political science in 1955 from Hunter College. Sanchez pursued post-graduate studies at New York University (NYU), working closely with Louise Bogan. During her time at NYU, she formed a writers‚Äô workshop in Greenwich Village, where the ‚ÄúBroadside Quartet‚Äù was born.The ‚ÄúBroadside Quartet‚Äù included other prominent Black Arts Movement artists such as Haki Madhubuti, Nikki Giovanni and Etheridge Knight. These young poets were introduced and promoted by Dudley Randall, an established poet and publisher. Although her first marriage to Puerto Rican Albert Sanchez did not last, Sonia Sanchez would retain her professional name. She and Albert had one daughter named Anita. She later married Etheridge Knight, had twin sons named Morani Neusi and Mungu Neusi, but they divorced after two years. Nonetheless, Motherhood heavily influenced the motifs of her poetry in the '70s with the bonds between mother and child emerging as a key theme. She also has three grandchildren. = Teaching = Sanchez taught 5th Grade in NYC at the Downtown Community School, until 1967. She has taught as a professor at eight universities and has lectured at more than 500 college campuses across the US, including Howard University. She was also a leader in the effort to establish the discipline of Black Studies at the university level. In 1966, while teaching at San Francisco State University she introduced Black Studies courses. Sanchez was the first to create and teach a course based on Black Women and literature in the United States and the course she offered on African-American literature is generally considered the first of its kind taught at a predominately white university. She viewed the discipline of Black Studies as both a new platform for the study of race and a challenge to the institutional biases of American universities. These efforts are clearly in line with the goals of the Black Arts Movement and was a known black feminist. Sanchez was the first Presidential Fellow at Temple University, where she began working in 1977. There, she held the Laura Carnell chair until her retirement in 1999. She is currently a poet-in-residence at Temple University. She has read her poetry in Africa, the Caribbean, China, Australia, Europe, Nicaragua, and Canada. = Activism = Sanchez supports the National Black United Front and was a very influential part of the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Arts Movement. In the early 1960s, Sanchez became a member of CORE (Congress for Racial Equality), where she met Malcolm X. Though she was originally an integrationist in her thinking, after hearing Malcolm X speak Sanchez became more separatist in her thinking and focused more on her black heritage and identity. In 1972, Sanchez joined the Nation of Islam, during which time she published A Blues Book for Blue Black Magical Women (1974), but she left the organization after three years in 1975 because their views on women's rights conflicted. She continues to advocate for the rights of oppressed women and minority groups. She wrote many plays and books that had to do with the struggles and lives of Black America. Among her plays are Sister Son/ji, which was first produced Off-Broadway at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater in 1972; Uh, Huh: But How Do it Free us?, staged in Chicago at the Northwestern University Theatre in 1975, and Malcolm Man/Don‚Äôt Live Here No Mo‚Äô, first produced in 1979 at the ASCOM Community Center in Philadelphia.\\"Sonia Sanchez\\", Writers Directory 2005, Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved August 9, 2019. Sanchez has edited two anthologies of Black literature: We Be Word Sorcerers: 25 Stories by Black Americans (1974) and 360¬∞ of Blackness Coming at You (1999). She is also committed to a variety of activist causes, including the Brandywine Peace Community, MADRE, and Plowshares. = Black Arts Movement = The aim of the Black Arts Movement was a renewal of black will, insight, energy, and awareness. Sanchez published poetry and essays in numerous periodicals in the 1960s, including The Liberator, Negro Digest, and Black Dialogue. Her writing established her importance as a political thinker to the \\"black aesthetic\\" program.Gates, Henry Louis, and Valerie Smith (eds), The Norton Anthology of African American Literature. W.W. Norton & Company, 2014 (Third edition). Sanchez gained a reputation as an important voice in the Black Arts movement after publishing the book of poems Home Coming in 1969. This collection and her second in 1970, titled We a BaddDDD People demonstrated her use of experimental poetic forms to discuss the development of black nationalism and identity. Style and themes Sanchez is known for her innovative melding of musical formats‚Äîsuch as the blues‚Äîand traditional poetic formats like haiku and tanka. She also uses spelling to celebrate the unique sound of black English, for which she gives credit to poets such as Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown. Her first collection of poems, Homecoming (1969), is known for its blues influences in both form and content. The collection describes both the struggle of defining black identity in the United States as well as the many causes for celebration Sanchez sees in black culture. Her second book, We a BaddDDD People (1970), solidifies her contribution to the Black Arts Movement aesthetic by focusing on the everyday lives of black men and women. These poems make use of urban black vernacular, experimental punctuation, spelling, and spacing, and the performative quality of jazz. Though still emphasizing what she sees as the need for revolutionary cultural change, Sanchez's later works, such as I've Been a Woman (1978), Homegirls and Handgrenades (1985), and Under a Soprano Sky (1987), tend to focus less on separatist themes (like those of Malcolm X), and more on themes of love, community, and empowerment. She continues to explores the haiku, tanka, and sonku forms, as well as blues-influenced rhythms. Later works continue her experiments with forms such as the epic in Does Your House Have Lions? (1997), an emotional account of her brother's deadly struggle with AIDS, and the haiku in Morning Haiku (2010). In addition to her poetry, Sanchez's contributions to the Black Arts Movement included drama and prose. She began writing plays while in San Francisco in the 1960s. Several of her plays challenge the masculinist spirit of the movement, focusing on strong female protagonists. Sanchez has been recognized as a pioneering champion of black feminism.  Contemporary works  Her more recent contemporary endeavors include a spoken-word interlude on \\"Hope is an Open Window\\", a song co-written by Diana Ross from her 1998 album Every Day is a New Day. The song is featured as the sound bed for a tribute video to 9/11 that can be viewed on YouTube. Sanchez is currently among 20 African-American women to be a part of \\"Freedom Sisters\\", a mobile exhibition initiated by the Cincinnati Museum Center and the Smithsonian Institution. Sanchez became Philadelphia's first Poet Laureate, after being appointed by Mayor Michael Nutter. She served in that position from 2012 to 2014.Jazmyn Burton, \\"Philadelphia names Sonia Sanchez first poet laureate\\", Temple News Center, January 28, 2012. Retrieved on November 21, 2014.

In the 1990s, Belverio was a filmmaker and performance artist, whose 1993 collaboration with best-selling author Camille Paglia on the short film Glennda and Camille Do Downtown, gained international attention. The film played at the Sundance Film Festival and won first prize for best short documentary at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. In this and other films of the 1990s, Belverio appeared on screen in the drag persona of Glennda Orgasm. Laurence Senelick, writing about female impersonation in \\"The Cambridge Guide to Theater\\", said that Belverio's performances as Glennda represented a radical edge in gay culture at the time, \\"as the politically correct gay community turned its back on drag.\\" Through these performances, Belverio was thought to be engaging in the kind of political and cultural critique that Paglia termed \\"drag queen feminism\\". In 1996 a retrospective of Belverio's film and video work was held at Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and marked the end of his career as a filmmaker. Shortly thereafter, his articles on the New York fashion scene began appearing in various publications such as Dutch, Zoo, i-D, Index, and Glue. Belverio has been a guest-editor and writer for the Asian culture and fashion magazine WestEast and worked between China and New York from 2002 to 2004. He won the award for editorial excellence from the Society of Publishers for his work on WestEast's \\"POP\\" and \\"SEX\\" issues in 2003. His book \\"Confessions from the Velvet Ropes: The Glamorous, Grueling Life of Thomas Onorato, New York's Top Club Doorman\\" was published by St. Martin's Press in summer 2006.

Named after now-Saint Jun√≠pero Serra, the school was founded by parents in 2003 and is independent of, though sanctioned by, the Diocese of Orange. Total enrollment as of 2015 was 1,225. The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In 2006, 2007 and 2008 the school was named as one of the top 50 Catholic high schools in the United States by the Catholic High School Honor Roll of the Cardinal Newman Society. History Planning for a new Catholic high school to serve South Orange County began in 1998. Unlike most Catholic schools, which are established by dioceses or religious institutes, the effort was spearheaded by Catholic laity led by Marc Spizziri, a local car dealer, and Timothy Busch, a tax attorney. The original plan had been to build on 35 acres of land owned by Rancho Capistrano Ministries, founded by Robert A. Schuller and run by Crystal Cathedral Ministries, which had been donated by businessman John Crean. Negotiations failed, however, as Rancho Capistrano wanted to participate in teaching, but the high school would have excluded non-Catholic instructors from teaching religion. They acquired a different parcel nearby, close to Interstate 5, where the current campus is located. The planned athletics fields, aquatics facilities, and performing arts center garnered stiff opposition from members of the Juane√±o band of the Acjachemen people. The land was the site of the former village of Putiidhem. Patricia Martz, a professor at California State University, Los Angeles who joined the opposition, estimated as many as 175 bodies could be buried there. Others, however, like local archaeologist Henry Koerper at Cypress College, cast doubt on those estimates, noting that only seven burial plots had been discovered. David Belardes, designated by the state of California to represent the Juane√±o, agreed to the plan so long as only fields, not buildings, were constructed, and that a monument be placed on the land. Other factions of Juane√±os rejected Belardes' authority, however, and joined neighboring property owners and environmentalists in a group called Spirit of Capistrano to block the project. Adding further complications, the Capistrano Unified School District identified the site as its first choice for a new middle school, and considered using eminent domain to take possession of it. Two lawsuits were filed, and opponents attempted to hold a public referendum on the project, though they failed to gather enough signatures. Picketers greeted students on the first day of school, September 3, 2003. Ultimately, the school district decided against the use of the property for its middle school. A last lawsuit, brought against the city of San Juan Capistrano for changing the zoning to allow the school's construction, was dismissed later in the month, and construction went forward as planned on November 18, to be completed for 2006. Athletics  JSerra competes in the Trinity League of the CIF Southern Section as the Lions. The school is seen to have sports rivalries with Santa Margarita Catholic High School, Dana Hills High School, and Mater Dei High School. As of 2020, the JSerra athletic program offers soccer, volleyball, water polo, swimming, baseball and softball, golf, basketball, cross country, track and field, boys' lacrosse, tennis, cheerleading football, and rugby as well as an award-winning choral music program. The $40 million athletic complex occupies 29 acres adjacent to the academic campus and features a 2000-seat gymnasium, Olympic-class swimming pool, and various fields and courts all using artificial turf. The golf teams practice at Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club in Mission Viejo. Incidents In December 2011, Spanish teacher and girls junior varsity volleyball coach Ricardo Aldana was arrested on suspicion of a sex act involving a student under age 14. In a statement, the school said they were \\"outraged and sickened\\" by the charges; they cooperated fully with the investigation and dismissed Aldana. Aldana was subsequently convicted on three counts of sexual molestation and sentenced to 3 years and 4 months in a state prison, he has been released since. In May 2018, a former assistant football coach at Laguna Beach and JSerra high schools who also worked as a substitute teacher has been arrested on drug and gun charges after an investigation by Costa Mesa police into white supremacist gang members. Brian Jay Bishop was arrested May 25, 2018, on suspicion of possession of methamphetamine for sale, possession of a concealed/loaded firearm while possessing drugs and possession of a gun for which he was not the registered owner, Costa Mesa police announced. Court records from 2006 show that he served jail time for driving while intoxicated/open alcohol container in Texas. His record includes a minor in possession of alcohol in 2002 in Texas and two other misdemeanor offenses from 2004. Many students, athletes, and coworkers have commented that they were surprised by his arrest.

The member of the CPSU since 1943. Ended engineering technical school (1930). In 1931‚Äì1938 the head of group of CB of the plant, since 1938 the deputy head of CB, then head of CB and the deputy of the main designer of the construction factory, from 1940 he became main designer. The Morozov took part of the participation in development of the first domestic, T-24 (1930) medium tank, and also the wheel-caterpillar BT-2 (1931), BT-5 (1932), BT-7 (1935) and BT-7M (1939)light tanks. BT tanks along with T-26 constituted the basis of the tank arm of Soviet Armies. As the technical lead of the project together with M. I. Koshkin and N. A. Kucherenko headed development of the medium T-34 tank in 1940. During the Great Patriotic War, he was the chief designer of upgrades of the T-34 tank, which was recognized as the best tank of the period of the Second World War. After the war, under the direction of Morozov, a number of new types of tanks, etc. was created. The Deputy of Supreme Council of the USSR of the 5th convocation awarded state awards of the USSR (1942, 1946, 1948) and Lenin's award (1967) to Morozov. He was awarded 3 Orders of Lenin, an award of the October Revolution, the Orders of Kutuzov of the 1st degree, Order of Suvorov of the 2nd degree, 3 awards of the Labour Red Banner, an award of the Red Star, and other medals.  Career  The fourteen-year-old teenager A. A. Morozov, having got a six-years education in a special school, came in March 1919 to the Kharkiv engine-building plant. His labor activity began in technical office of the factory as the filing clerk. Further work as the copyist, the draftsman and the designer acquainted him with creation at the factory of the first chain track tractors \\"Communar\\". Since 1928 come back on the factory after service in Red Army (in air brigade the aviation technician-mechanic) Morozov as a part of design group provided production of a prototype of the maneuverable T-1-12 tank, and then participated in designing and release of the subsequent modification of the tank which received the T-24 brand. This tank was one of the first tanks of a domestic design, in it were the powerful engine and a number of original nodes of transmission were established. The period of 1929 ‚Äì 1931 was associated for A. A. Morozov with study on correspondence department of the Moscow automotive institute of M. V. Lomonosov, and then ‚Äì on evening department of the Kharkiv machine-building technical school. Upon termination of technical school Morozov was directly involved in designing and development of serial production of the BT wheel-caterpillar tank. It designed many nodes and details of transmission and a running gear of the tank which was issued for a number of years in the form of gradually the enhanced modifications (from BT-2 to BT-7M). At this stage of design activities A. A. Morozov in a short space of time gained considerable experience, reached the level of the chief designer, began to direct design group and since July 1936 headed sector of CB on new designing. In the second half of the 30th years the task on substantial was increase of shell firmness of armored corpus of tanks and increase in their survivability in the battlefield was set for designers of the factory. Designing of the wheel-caterpillar A-20 tank with increased, in comparison with the BT tank, quantity of the leading wheels skating rinks and with the case and a tower of an original form was one of important developments of that period. During the course of performance this work for the purpose of check of a possibility of simplification of a design of the tank it was decided to design in addition the tank, close in parameters, but without the independent wheel course. The new A-32 tank in many parts was the same as A-20: similar configuration and form of the case, same V-2 engine diesel. Separate constructive decisions, such as some nodes of transmission and a running gear without basic changes were used in BT, A-20 and A-32 tanks. At the end of 1938 both projects (A-20 and A-32) were submitted for consideration of the Main Council of War of Red Army where M. I. Koshkin is the chief designer of the factory of a name of Komintern and A. A. Morozov ‚Äì his deputy made reports of their work. As a result, after discussion of introduced drafts permission to production of both tanks, having tested them to make a final choice of one of them for acceptance on arms was got. In June‚ÄìAugust 1939 comparative testing were carried out. No essential benefits of the wheel-caterpillar tank in comparison with caterpillar were revealed, and in conclusions of the commission it was written down: \\"the A-32 tank as the having inventory on increase in weight, it is reasonable to protect more powerful armor, having respectively increased durability of separate details ‚Ä¶\\" Therefore, soon the A-32 tank was finished loading to 24 tons and will put on additional trials. Testing confirmed a possibility of increasing the mass of the tank approximately by 5 tonnes, that allowed to increase case armor thickness from 20 to 45 mm and to strengthen a number of nodes and aggregates. The committee of Defense in case of Council of People's Commissars of the USSR the resolution of 19 December 1939 accepted the new average tank to production at the Kharkiv plant of a name of Komintern, having appropriated it the T-34 brand. So, because of the courageous innovative approach to the solution of a complex challenge of creation of the average tank of new generation, the designers directed in the beginning by M. I. Koshkin, and after his death A. A. Morozov, shortly before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War created the average T-34 tank in which for the first time in the world it was succeeded to combine optimum high rates of fire power, anti-whizband protection and mobility at the low cost of production, reliability and simplicity in operation. The State award USSR was awarded by the order of the Government in 1942 for development of a design of the T-34 tank to Alexander Aleksandrovich Morozov, Mikhail Ilyich Koshkin and Nikolay Alekseevich Kucherenko who were during this period the chief of CB of serial production of the plant. Work at the Kharkov's factory by Comintern in the prewar years was not limited to the formulation of the production of the T-34. The group of designers, itself headed by A.A. Morozov, continued to search for ways to further improve the medium tanks. As a result of the continuation of this work in the 1942‚Äì1944 years at the Ural's tank factory were developed even more powerful medium tanks T-43 and T-44. In the early days of World War II, the Soviet government has set task for designers-tank-builders to ensure a significant expansion of the T-34 tank production, their production was transferred to several factories of the Volga region, the Urals, in Siberia. Development of production of T-34 tanks by factories with different equipment composition, with low qualification of the majority of workers, many of whom were adolescents and women, made possible by good process flue design, that to a large extent, in addition to the work of engineers, determined in the daily hard work of designers on simplification of the tank, finding substitutes for scarce materials, adapting its design to mass production. However, the battle characteristics of tank T-34 are continuously improved and in the second half of 1943 the tank was radically modernized, with a new turret and a powerful 85-mm cannon. This was a response to the new German Panther and Tiger tanks and Elefant Ferdinand tank destroyers. The efforts to improve the design of the T-34 and increase its armaments were directed by Morozov and his deputy N.A. Kucherenko, designers Y.I. Baran, A.A. Moloshtanov, M.I. Tarshinov, B.A. Chernyak, A.I. Shpayhler and others. All of them for a fundamental improvement of the existing medium tank design and development of a new medium tank was awarded the State Prize of the USSR. During the years of World War II was released and transferred to the Red Army 52 th. of tanks T-34, the best tank of the Second World War. In this great merit of factory groups, where the directors were U.E. Maksarev, E.E. Rubinchik B. G. Myzrukov, K.A. Zadorozhnyy and others, a lot of effort and attention paid to the production of tank T-34 Commissar V.A. Malyshev, his deputy A.A. Goregliad, I.M. Saltzman, I.M. Popov. A.A. Khabakhpashev and others. After the war, several hundred T-34 tanks were mounted on pedestals, and become monuments, symbolizing the heroism of Soviet soldiers-tankmans, shown in the battles for the freedom and independence of our country, and the heroic labor of the Soviet tank builders. In the difficult years of the war, A.A. Morozov, giving himself entirely work, has achieved outstanding success in strengthening the combat power of the armored forces of the Red Army, for which he was in January 1943 awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor, and later awarded the highest military leader orders: Kutuzov Class I, and Suvorov II degree. He was promoted to the rank of Major- General of engineering and tank service. Design Bureau, led by A.A.Morozov, was awarded the Order of Lenin. The post-war period of the Morozov associated with the continuation of the line of the development of mass medium tanks, partially embodied in the final stages of the war in the T-44. The whole wealth of experience in the production and use of the T-34 tank was used on the T-54 and T-55. Their designs were reflected many of the achievements of science and technology of the postwar period, as a result of which they were created and put into mass production, in particular, weapons stabilizers, electronic night-vision goggles, equipment for underwater driving system of protection against weapons of mass destruction, and others. Medium tanks the first post-war generation, started under the guidance and the ideas of Morozov, had high combat characteristics, and they are simple in design and reliable in operation. Their development was attended by many designers KB, including P.P. Vasilyev, V.G. Matyuhin, V.K. Baydakov, A.V. Kolesnikov. For the development of the T-54 A.A. Morozov was the third time awarded the USSR State Prize. In the second half of the 50s of the creative life of Morozov it was associated with laying the foundations of the design of the second generation of the postwar period tanks. He is a supporter of the revolutionary development of armored vehicles, went boldly to the sharp separation of promising new designs of construction solutions, tested at that time in our country and abroad. The allies were involved in the research organization of industry and the Ministry of Defence. Particular attention was paid to minimizing the volume and weight characteristics of components, assemblies and machines in general. Being a great designer, A.A. Morozov spent much time directly behind the drawing board, review and analyze hundreds of diagrams and drawings. Very responsible development carried out close associates Morozov ‚Äì Y.I. Baranov, E.V. Morozov, M.A. Nabutovskii, B.N. Poliakov, G.A. Omelyanovich, M.G. Stepanov and others in Bureau of the new design and then in the course of the development of mass production of the T-64. This tank has been reduced crew due to the use autoloader powerful smoothbore gun. The length of the engine compartment is significantly reduced due to the coaxial arrangement of the transverse two-stroke diesel engine and two symmetrically arranged planetary gears simultaneously performing the role of rotating machinery. On the new basis were designed fire control system, shift, combination of armor protection, smoke masking, and so on. The tank was used ejection cooling system, high-performance air purifiers, the most lightweight chassis with powerful shock absorbers and a caterpillar, equipped with rubber- metal hinges, etc. For this work, A.A. Morozov, together with Y.A. Baran, L.L. Golints, V.I. Kreopalov, V.S. Staravojtov and other was awarded in 1967 the Lenin Prize. Morozov rightly be called the creator of \\"Morozov school\\" tank production. The characteristic features of the school include: commitment, novelty solutions, no unnecessary risks, thoroughness and accuracy in all things, the greatest possible efficiency and simplicity of the combat vehicle design, combined with high adaptability and reliability, with minimum dimensions and weight. Labor way of Alexander Alexandrovich Morozov's was adequately marked the highest awards. It was in 1974 for the second time marked by the rank of the Hero of Socialist Labor. He was awarded many medals and ten medals of USSR. Member of the Communist Party in 1943, he was elected deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He was awarded the academic knowledge of Doctor of Technical Sciences, Honored machine building Engineer of the USSR. In the life A.A. Morozov was very modest and simple, loved the friendly joke, often met with young people and spoke at Komsomol meetings, his office door was nearly always open, it constantly can be seen bent over drawings and calculations. Creativity and hard work ‚Äì that's a measure that Morozov valued the work of their employees. All work activity Alexander Alexandrovich is an example of selfless service and impeccable chosen cause. For the sake of the progress of the domestic tank building he lived and worked outstanding designer tanks Alexander Morozov. \\"Tanks and People\\" ‚Äì the second part of the diary Morozov was published 9 May 2007.

Career He received his B.Sc. degree from Millsaps College in 1966 and Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1971. Bartlett was an NDEA and IBM predoctoral fellow at the University of Florida under the joint supervision of N. Yngve √ñhrn and Per-Olov L√∂wdin. Bartlett was subsequently an NSF postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University, Denmark with Jan Linderberg and a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University with Robert G. Parr. Bartlett became a staff scientist at Battelle's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and then at Battelle Memorial Institute, Ohio. In 1981, Bartlett returned to Gainesville, as a Professor of Chemistry and Physics, and then in 1988 rose to the rank of Graduate Research Professor. Bartlett has been widely recognized as a pioneer of rigorous many-body methods for electron correlation, in particular, many-body perturbation and coupled cluster methods, which are today‚Äôs central computational tool for accurate electronic structure predictions. Bartlett and his coworkers were the first to formulate and implement coupled cluster theory with all single and double excitation operators (CCSD) in 1982, followed by triple (CCSDT) in 1987, quadruple (CCSDTQ), and even quintuple (CCSDTQP) excitation operators, and also many-body perturbation methods up to the sixth order. He developed a version of Feynman diagrams that both expedited the derivation of the equations and helped to visualize the physics of electron correlation. He also promoted the concept of size extensivity for many-body theory that scales properly with the number of particles, now viewed as an essential element of sound quantum chemistry approximations. Bartlett was also the first to explore the combination of coupled-cluster and many-body perturbation theories (in 1985) and proposed vastly successful approximations. It is now widely agreed that the coupled cluster and many-body perturbation methods that Bartlett has been instrumental in establishing offer the most predictive, generally applicable approaches in the field. These methods helped electronic structure theory be accepted by the chemistry community as a reliable and integral branch of chemistry. Bartlett has been among the most frequently cited chemists and ranked 25th in the period of 1981‚Äì97 according to ISI.

It is found in many types of solid deodorants, rubbers, latex paints, and inks. It is also a component of some food additives and food flavorings.Klaus Schumann, Kurt Siekmann, \\"Soaps\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Use Characteristic of soaps, sodium stearate has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, the carboxylate and the long hydrocarbon chain, respectively. These two chemically different components induce the formation of micelles, which present the hydrophilic heads outwards and their hydrophobic (hydrocarbon) tails inwards, providing a lipophilic environment for hydrophobic compounds. The tail part dissolves the grease (or) dirt and forms the micelle. It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a surfactant to aid the solubility of hydrophobic compounds in the production of various mouth foams. Production Sodium stearate is produced as a major component of soap upon saponification of oils and fats. The percentage of the sodium stearate depends on the ingredient fats. Tallow is especially high in stearic acid content (as the triglyceride), whereas most fats only contain a few percent. The idealized equation for the formation of sodium stearate from stearin (the triglyceride of stearic acid) follows: :(C18H35O2)3C3H5 + 3 NaOH ‚Üí C3H5(OH)3 + 3 C18H35O2Na Purified sodium stearate can be made by neutralizing stearic acid with sodium hydroxide.

Its upper course, upstream from the confluence with the Z√¢rna, is also called Valea Rea. Its length is and its basin size is . It frequently dries up in summer, owing to the works upstream that have redirected part of its water supply toward a reservoir serving the hydroelectric plant on the Arge»ô.

A former servant of Vlad, held as a prisoner and servant to the Ottomans but still loyal to the Prince, having seen the shadow of Vlad's wife behind a window and shot an arrow in that direction, with a message informing that the Ottoman army was going to attack the castle the next morning. Upon reading the message, Vlad's wife flung herself off the castle's tower and into the stream below the castle, preferring death to Ottoman captivity.

He played as a right-handed opening batsman who occasionally bowled left-arm orthodox spin. Since retiring from first-class cricket in 2006 he has been a cricket journalist with The Times and Sky Sports. Fulton was born in Lewisham in Greater London in 1971. Early career Having been educated at The Judd School in Tonbridge and the University of Kent, Fulton joined Kent in 1992. His first-class debut came at Fenner's, where he scored 16 and 42 in the match against Cambridge University. Later that year he appeared in the University Championship final for the University of Kent, where he contributed 10 runs in the defeat to the University of Durham. Once established in the first-team, Fulton performed consistently in the seasons between 1995 and 1998, where he averaged over 30 every year. 1996 also saw Fulton take his only first-class wicket; that of Oxford University batsman William Kendall, caught and bowled. Fulton's best run-scoring return was 954 runs in 1998, a season in which he hit his first double century. Playing against Yorkshire at Mote Park, Maidstone, Fulton posted 207 not out over the course of ten-and-a-half hours to save Kent from a heavy defeat. However, his innings was criticised by some, notably Clive Ellis of The Daily Telegraph, of being so slow that it prevented Kent from reaching a position to set a target. His run-scoring returns declined in 1999 and 2000, whilst his average slipped into the mid-twenties. However, 2001 proved a much more productive year. In eighteen first-class matches, Fulton scored a total of 1892 runs, at an average of 75.68. His form over the season was noticed by the national selectors, who according to Nasser Hussain, originally selected him in place of Mark Butcher for the fourth Test against Australia, before having a change of heart and reinstating Butcher. Nonetheless, Fulton was named Player of the Year by the Professional Cricketers' Association at the end of the season. Captaincy and later career The 2002 season saw Fulton share the captaincy with Matthew Fleming, with Fulton leading the side in first-class cricket and Fleming leading in one-day matches. The captaincy did not affect his batting, as he scored 1358 runs, his second thousand-run season in succession. The Australian captain Steve Waugh, in his brief spell as overseas player for Kent, remarked that he could be \\"a future England captain\\" Whilst preparing for the 2003 season, Fulton was hit in the eye by a ball from a bowling machine, whilst practising the pull shot. The injury ruled him out for the first eight weeks of the season, and Fulton admitted upon standing down from the captaincy three seasons later that his eye was still troubling him. Despite this, he still managed to score over 600 runs in eleven matches. He consistently scored runs for the next three seasons, whilst helping Kent challenge for first-class honours. 2004 saw Kent finish second to Warwickshire, and his side also challenged for the 2005 title. He stepped down from the one-day captaincy after being dropped, ahead of Kent's C&G; Trophy quarter-final against Warwickshire in 2005. Handing the one-day captaincy to Matthew Walker, he continued as first-class captain until the end of the season, where a run- chase agreement led to him being criticised by other county captains. In an attempt to keep his side's Championship hopes alive, he agreed to chase a target of 420 in 70 overs with Nottinghamshire captain Stephen Fleming; Kent managed only to reach 210. The win for Nottinghamshire secured them the Championship. Shane Warne, the Hampshire captain whose side were also in the running for the title, described the agreement as \\"one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.\\" Fulton stood down as captain a week later. Fulton was awarded a benefit year in 2006, with proceeds totalling ¬£105,000, half of which was given to charity. He retired at the end of the season, having scored 155 in his final first-class innings; against Middlesex. Owing to club captain Rob Key being rested and stand-in captain Martin van Jaarsveld being in hospital, Fulton led the side on to the field during the final session as acting captain.

Along with its known carcinogenic and teratogenic effects, contact with the substance can yield symptoms such as skin irritation, burns, itching, thickened skin, rash, loss of pigment, poor appetite, a metallic or garlic taste, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, decreased blood pressure, and headache. Severe acute poisoning may lead to nervous system damage resulting in weakness, poor coordination, or ‚Äúpins and needles‚Äù sensations, eventual paralysis, and death.New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services. Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet: Sodium Arsenite (2013-05-01) Application It is primarily used as a pesticide, but has other uses such as hide preservative, antiseptic, dyeing, and soaps. Sodium arsenite is an appropriate chemical stressor to induce the production of heat shock proteins, and the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules. Sodium arsenite can be used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry, as it is able to reduce a trihaloalkane to a dihaloalkane: :CHBr3 + Na3AsO3 + NaOH ‚Üí CH2Br2 + Na3AsO4 + NaBr Safety The LD50 (oral, mouse) is 40 mg/kg.

The band was from the Washington, D.C. area, then later moved to Astoria, Queens. While not a religious group, the band chose the name Cecilia from Saint Cecilia, patron saint of music and of the blind.  History  The band was formed by the members of the Veltz family, then living in Vienna, Virginia in 1998 when the three Veltz youngsters, Allison, Drew and Laura, began performing songs written by their father, Kenneth Veltz, at local venues. The group was originally an acoustic trio, playing local open mic gigs with Drew playing guitar for his sisters. When the family's financials were in a downturn, the band became the family business and Kenneth and mother Jeannie joined their children on drums and vocals, respectively. The group moved to New York in 2000. That same year they recorded Live at Zig's at two live performances in August, which was released in 2001. After a string of temporary bassists, Cecilia added Kevin Jacoby in late 2000. Cecilia was in negotiations to join Blackbird Records an affiliate of Atlantic Records just before the merger of AOL and Time Warner, which ended Blackbird's affiliation with Atlantic. This led to Cecilia being signed by Atlantic Records in early 2001. In the aftermath of September 11 the group recorded an EP entitled September in tribute to the firefighters lost. They donated the proceeds from the album sales to firefighter charities and the group devoted much of their work in benefit of firefighters at that time. After disagreements with Atlantic, the group parted ways with the label in the fall of 2002 before recording an album. The EP Off The Record (album) contains demo cuts for that never- recorded album. That same fall the band played a series of acoustic shows in the window of the Manhattan Theatre Source and later released a live album from those performances. In 2004 the band recorded their first complete studio album, This, through the help of fan funding. The band announced in late January 2006 that Kevin Jacoby would be leaving the band and at that time the final version of This had not yet been released. In September, 2006, This was released, under the band name The Veltz Family, rather than as Cecilia. Cecilia has toured extensively on the eastern coast of the United States, with regular performances in both New York and Washington, DC areas. Cecilia has shared the stage with other Virginia acts including Virginia Coalition, Pat McGee Band and Tim Reynolds, and performed at the legendary Wetlands Preserve before its closing in 2001.  Music  The band's pop music sound is focused around the three-part vocal harmonies provided by lead singers Laura and Allison along with backing vocals by their mother Jeannie, which are reminiscent of the Indigo Girls and Mariah Carey. The vocals are supported by Drew's catchy lead guitar riffs, often evoking Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds comparisons and Kevin Jacoby's melodic bass lines, often in the style of Fleetwood Mac's John McVie. Patriarch Ken plays drums as well as adding vocals and guitar parts (often simultaneously). Ken is known for playing a bare-bones \\"street kit\\" that includes a Djembe as an all-purpose drum. The band's final lineup consisted of: * Allison Veltz - lead vocal, percussion * Drew Veltz - lead guitar * Jeannie Veltz - vocals, percussion * Ken Veltz - songwriter, drums, guitar, vocals * Laura Veltz - songwriter, lead vocal, rhythm guitar, accordion, percussion * Kevin Jacoby - bass  Discography  * 1999 - It Just Doesn't Matter * 1999 - Kitchen Mix * 2001 - Live @ Zig's * 2002 - September * 2002 - Off The Record * 2003 - Live @ The Source * 2006 - This (as The Veltz Family)  Followup  * Allison and Laura lend their vocals to the Pat McGee Band track \\"Shady\\" from the band's 2004 release, Save Me. * Lee Solomon (LoveBuzz, Soul Driver, Down Holly) was the band's bassist in the early days before Kevin Jacoby joined the band, but at times Drew would play bass on some songs while Ken simultaneously played drums and guitar, while singing background vocals. * Upon the announcement that Kevin Jacoby was leaving, the band has been \\"taking some time to re-configure.\\" * Laura is living in Nashville, Tennessee, working as a songwriter. She had four songs on the debut album of Eden's Edge, and a cut with Jana Kramer, \\"What I Love About (Your) Love\\". Her first tune released as a single, \\"Drunk Last Night\\", a co-write with Josh Osborne, charted at #1 for the Eli Young Band, shortly followed by \\"Live A Little\\", recorded by Dean Alexander, which also peaked at #1, and \\"Lonely Eyes\\", recorded by Chris Young, which reached #13. Laura has a co- publishing contract with Warner/Chappell, Nashville, and Big Machine Music, and often performs live in \\"writer's rounds\\". * Allison has also relocated to Nashville. Like Laura, she performs frequently in the best of Nashville's many \\"listening room\\" venues. Allie independently produced her second EP, \\"The White Room\\", which was released in December, 2015. It was created as part of a Rockethub crowd-funding project, in conjunction with an OvationTV contest, with three winners to be awarded $5k additional funding, plus air-time on OvationTV. \\"Mr. Taxi\\", a song Allison co-wrote, was recorded by \\"Girls Generation\\" (aka SNSD), reaching #1 in Japan and South Korea in April 2011, with a chart run of 37 weeks. Blaster Records released Allison's debut single \\"Bright Side\\", in April, 2014, followed by a music video in June. Her debut EP \\"Welcome to Wonderland\\", also released on Blaster, in May, 2015, was co- produced by Dan Mukala, Allison's co-writer on \\"Bright Side\\", and Mark Bright, who has also produced Carrie Underwood, Rascal Flats, Keith Urban, and Shakira. * Ken and Jeannie are also in Nashville, still performing as an acoustic duo in small, intimate clubs, house concerts, and listening rooms. * Drew is still alive. * Kevin Jacoby (KJ) stayed in New York City and married costume designer Cora Levin. He returned to life as a freelance bass player, appearing live and on recordings with artists including La Mecanica Popular, Ato Essandoh, Chris London, Owen Brown, and Rocky Bryant of Average White Band. In 2017, KJ formed The Oddysy with DJ Johnny Juice of Public Enemy. The first single, Incantation, was produced by Scott Hull. The band plans to release their debut album in the spring of 2018. It will feature guest appearances by Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run DMC, Charlie Brown of Leaders of the New School, and Chuck D of Public Enemy. Rock music groups from Washington, D.C.

Usually, however, the salt is handled as its dihydrate Na2Cr2O7¬∑2H2O. Virtually all chromium ore is processed via conversion to sodium dichromate and virtually all compounds and materials based on chromium are prepared from this salt.Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, \\"Chromium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim, 2005. In terms of reactivity and appearance, sodium dichromate and potassium dichromate are very similar. The sodium salt is, however, around twenty times more soluble in water than the potassium salt (49 g/L at 0 ¬∞C) and its equivalent weight is also lower, which is often desirable.Freeman, F. \\"Sodium Dichromate\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . Production Sodium dichromate is generated on a large scale from ores containing chromium(III) oxides. The ore is fused with a base, typically sodium carbonate, at around 1000 ¬∞C in the presence of air (source of oxygen): 2Cr2O3 + 4Na2CO3 + 3O2 -> 4Na2CrO4 + 4CO2 This step solubilizes the chromium and allows it to be extracted into hot water. At this stage, other components of the ore such as aluminium and iron compounds, are poorly soluble. Acidification of the resulting aqueous extract with sulfuric acid or carbon dioxide affords the dichromate: 2Na2CrO4 + 2CO2 + H2O -> Na2Cr2O7 + 2NaHCO3 2Na2CrO4 + H2SO4 -> Na2Cr2O7 + Na2SO4 + H2O The dichromate is isolated as the dihydrate by crystallization. In this way, many millions of kilograms of sodium dichromate are produced annually. Since chromium(VI) is toxic, especially as the dust, such factories are subject to stringent regulations. For example, effluent from such refineries is treated with reducing agents to return any chromium(VI) to chromium(III), which is less threatening to the environment. A variety of hydrates of this salt are known, ranging from the decahydrate below 19.5 ¬∞C (CAS# ) as well as hexa-, tetra-, and dihydrates. Above 62 ¬∞C, these salts lose water spontaneously to give the anhydrous material. It is crystallised around 30 to 35 degrees C Reactions Dichromate and chromate salts are oxidizing agents. For the tanning of leather, sodium dichromate is first reduced with sulfur dioxide. In the area of organic synthesis, this compound oxidizes benzylic and allylic C-H bonds to carbonyl derivatives. For example, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. Similarly, 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene is oxidized by Na2Cr2O7 to 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. Secondary alcohols are oxidized to the corresponding ketone, e.g. menthol to menthone; dihydrocholesterol to cholestanone: :3 R2CHOH + Cr2O72‚àí + 2 H+ ‚Üí 3 R2C=O + Cr2O3 + 4 H2O Relative to the potassium salt, the main advantage of sodium dichromate is its greater solubility in water and polar solvents like acetic acid. Sodium dichromate can be used in fluorene to fluorenone conversion. Safety Like all hexavalent chromium compounds, sodium dichromate is carcinogenic. The compound is also corrosive and exposure may produce severe eye damage or blindness.ILO 1369 - Sodium Dichromate Human exposure further encompasses impaired fertility, heritable genetic damage and harm to unborn children.

Biography David Ussishkin was born in Jerusalem. Ussishkin is the grandson of the Zionist leader Menachem Ussishkin. He studied at Gymnasia Rehavia, in Rehavia and served in the Israel Defense Forces between 1953 and 1955 in the Giv'ati Brigade. He studied archaeology and Jewish History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem between 1955 and 1966. Received his B.A. in 1958, his Master of Arts degree in Archaeology and Jewish History in 1962 (with distinction) and his Ph. D. in 1966. His Doctoral Thesis on \\"The Neo-Hittite Monuments, their Dating and Style\\" was written under the guidance of professor Yigael Yadin. Beginning in 1966 and until his retirement in 2004 he taught archaeology of Israel and Hittite art at the University of Tel-Aviv, receiving full professorship in 1985. Academic and archaeology career From 1966 to 2004, he taught archaeology at Tel Aviv University. Ussishkin is an expert on the Iron Age of the Land of Israel. He has directed and co-directed important excavations at Lachish, Jezreel and Megiddo. In 1968‚Äì71 he undertook, with the assistance of his colleague Gabriel Barkay, the first complete survey of the Silwan necropolis rock-cut tombs of the Jerusalem First Temple period necropolis atop which the village of Silwan was built.\\"The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan,\\" Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46. Headed the department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Tel Aviv University, between 1975 and 1978. Between 1980 and 1984 he was the director of the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University. From 1975 to 2004 he was the editor of Tel- Aviv, Journal of the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University. 1996‚Äì2006: Incumbent, Austria Chair in Archaeology of the Land of Israel in the Biblical Period, Tel Aviv University. In addition to his participation in excavations, Ussishkin also conducted research and published works in several fields. Chief amongst those are his publications regarding issues of stratigraphy in different sites from the Biblical Era in Israel, works dealing with the connection between historical data and archaeological data, and his work on monumental Hittite Art. While a student, Ussishkin took part in many digs; among those were the excavations of Chalcolithic Beersheba (late 5th millennium BC) and of the Chalcolithic burial caves in that region, under Jean Perrot; the excavations of Megiddo, under Yigael Yadin; Caltepe, in Turkey, under Tahsin √ñzg√º√ß; In 1960‚Äì1961 he was Yigael Yadin's chief assistant in the excavations of the Cave of Letters, in Nahal Hever, the Judaean Desert. Documents from the period of the Bar Kokhba Rebellion were discovered in this cave, among those are some letters issued by Bar Kokhba's headquarters. = Ein Gedi and Masada = During 1961 and 1962 he participated in the excavations of Ein Gedi under Benjamin Mazar. He supervised the excavations of The Calcolithic Temple located near the Ein Gedi Spring, and later published the excavation report. This was a unique temple: no contemporary settlements have been found in its vicinity, and it appears that it was used by nomads who lived in the area during the Late Chalcolithic period. No artifacts were found in this temple. Ussishkin believed that the collection of Chalcolithic ritualistic artifacts, made mostly of copper and of ivory, that were discovered in a cache located in a cave in Nahal Mishmar, were the artifacts from this ancient temple. He conjectured that they had been brought to that cave and hidden there by the temple's priests as part of their preparations for abandoning the site, hoping, later, to return to it. In the years 1964 and 1965 he was field supervisor in the excavations of Masada, under Yigael Yadin. In 1967 to 1968 he was co-director of the Tel Bet Yerah (Khirbet Kerak) excavations. = Silwan = In the years 1968 to 1971 Ussishkin headed a survey of Silwan, in Eastern Jerusalem, across from the City of David. In the era of the First Jerusalem Temple, about 50 rock-cut tombs of rich and powerful people from the Kingdom of Judah were carved into the mountainside in this area (known as the Silwan Necropolis / Siloam). These graves have been absorbed by the houses of the local village of Silwan. The site itself has been known for centuries, and all of its tombs have been plundered by grave robbers. Some of them had been studied before, but only after 1967 did it become possible for Israeli archaeologists to conduct a thorough survey of the site and to collect additional data from it. Three of the most stately tombs had inscriptions in the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet carved above their entrances. One of these is the famous tomb nicknamed The Grave of Pharaoh's Daughter. An inscription above another tomb states that this is the tomb of \\"....yehu the royal steward\\" (the Shebna inscription). The report from this survey was published in a book that was also translated to English.D. Ussishkin, The Village of Silwan, The Necropolis from the Period of the Judean Kingdom, Jerusalem, 1993 = Lachish = Between the years 1973 and 1994 he administered the excavation project of Tel Lachish. This is a site of major importance to the Archaeology of Israel. It had been one of the most important cities of the Kingdom of Judah, before it was destroyed by Sennacherib, king of Assyria, in 701 BC. The excavation of the site was systematic and it was conducted on a large scale. The researchers focused on the layers dated to the end of the Canaanite / beginning of the Israelite periods. Simultaneously, members of the expedition began preserving and reconstructing the city gates from the Israelite period. The data found in these excavations, together with historical data and with the description of the conquest, as portrayed in the large Lachish reliefs made by Sennacherib that were discovered in Nineveh, made it possible to reconstruct the history of the conquest and destruction of Lachish during Sennacherib's campaign against Judah, in 701 BC (these wall- reliefs are currently part of the collection of the British Museum). This campaign was launched to repress the rebellion started by Hezekiah, king of Judah, against Assyria. Lachish was taken, after a short siege and a fierce battle, and destroyed completely. In 2004 Ussishkin published a full report of the excavation project, in 5 volumes.The renewed archaeological excavations at Lachish (1973‚Äì1994) / David Ussishkin ; with contributions by Gabriella Bachi ... [et al.] ; editor: David Ussishkin ; assistant editor: Jared L. Miller; Tel Aviv : Emery and Claire Yass Publications in Archaeology, 2004 = Beitar = In 1984, following his work in the Cave of Letters, and due to his interest in the Bar Cochba Rebellion, he initiated archaeological soundings in Beitar, which had been Bar Cochba's last stronghold. It is located in southeastern Jerusalem. This site had already been known for a while. Remains of the siege works done by the Romans when they were besieging this stronghold, in 135 AD, had been discovered in its vicinity: the Roman military camps, their siege walls. Ussishkin found that in that period Beitar had been a small settlement, selected by Bar Cochba to be his headquarters for several reasons: its proximity to ancient Jerusalem and to the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza and the fact that it had a spring and was situated on an easily defensible hilltop. The excavations revealed the wall hastily erected by Bar Cochba's men just before the siege had begun, and they have also discovered remains of the ammunition used by the fort's defenders: arrowheads and sling stones. = Jezreel = In the years 1990 - 1996 he excavated Jezreel together with John Woodhead, from the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. The excavation was started because walls from the Israelite period were discovered during development works conducted on the site. This site is key to the research of the Israelite period and its chronology. Jezreel was an important centre, probably of a military nature, of the Kingdom of Israel, at the era of the Omride dynasty - specifically, during the reigns of Omri and Ahab, his son. The Old Testament story of Naboth the Jezreelite takes place in Jezreel. Remains of the large fortified complex built there by Omri and by Ahab was discovered in the excavations. It had apparently been destroyed by the Arameans (kingdom of Aram Damascus) in the late 9th century BC. A church from the era of the Crusades was also discovered in Jezreel. = Tel Megiddo = Tel Megiddo has been systematically excavated, by an expedition of the University of Tel Aviv, since 1992. This expedition has been headed by Ussishkin and Israel Finkelstein. Megiddo is a key site for the archaeological research of Israel. Large scale excavations had been conducted in Tel Megiddo previously by the left many archaeological and historical issues unresolved. In the renewed excavations researchers are focusing on layers from the Israelite Period, when this city had been one of the major cities in the Kingdom of Israel.

He became sole ruler of the Margraviate of Brandenburg upon the death of his cousin John V of Brandenburg-Salzwedel in 1317. Waldemar is known as the last in the line of Ascanian margraves starting with Albert the Bear in 1157; he was only succeeded by his minor cousin Henry II, who died one year later. Life He was a son of Margrave Conrad of Brandenburg-Stendal and his wife Constance, eldest daughter of the Piast duke Przemys≈Ç I of Greater Poland. Waldemar was co-regent from 1302, and succeeded as margrave upon the death of his uncle Otto IV in 1308. Pomerelia within a map of the State of the Teutonic Order in 1410 In 1307 Waldemar signed an agreement with the Swienca family ceding him the lands of Pomerelia (Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania), whereafter Brandenburg troops occupied ≈öwiecie, Tczew and all strategic locations up to Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig). In turn, the Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw I called for the support of the Teutonic Knights, and after their takeover of Danzig, Waldemar by the 1309 Treaty of Soldin relinquished his claims on Pomerelia east of the ≈Åeba River to the Teutonic Order for a payment of 10,000 silver Mark. The castle districts Schlawe and Stolp including the Swienca residence of R√ºgenwalde at first remained with Brandenburg. In 1312, Waldemar also waged war against Margrave Frederick I of Meissen. Frederick was captured and arrested; to regain his freedom, he had to cede the March of Lusatia as well as the towns of Torgau and Gro√üenhain to Brandenburg and to pay a ransom of 32,000 silver Mark. In the Imperial election of 1314, Waldemar voted for the Wittelsbach candidate Louis IV against his Habsburg rival Frederick the Fair. In 1316, Waldemar again occupied Dresden until the feud with Meissen was finally brought to an end in 1317. In the ongoing conflict with Prince Henry II of Mecklenburg, Waldemar supported the citizens of Stralsund against an impending Mecklenburg invasion and occupied the Lordship of Stargard, a former possession of Henry's late wife Beatrix of Brandenburg. Thereby, he provoked a large coalition of Mecklenburg, Werle, and the Kingdom of Denmark against him. In August 1316, Waldemar's troops were defeated near Gransee. According to the 1317 Treaty of Templin, the margrave had to surrender Stargard and Neubrandenburg to Mecklenburg. He also had to waive the previous Pomerelian acquisitions of Schlawe and Stolp, which passed to Duke Wartislaw IV of Pomerania. In 1319 Waldemar acquired the Silesian towns of Z√ºllichau and Schwiebus. Family Statue by Reinhold Begas as part of the Siegesallee, 1900 In 1309 he married his cousin Agnes (-1334), a daughter of Margrave Hermann of Brandenburg- Salzwedel. The marriage remained childless. Waldemar was the last governing member of the Brandenburg line of the Ascanian House. With the death of his cousin John V in 1317, the younger Salzwedel line of the Brandenburg margraves became extinct. From 1318 Waldemar also acted as a guardian for his minor cousin Henry II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal. His advance towards the Prussian lands was resumed more than 200 years later, when both Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia were under the rule of the Hohenzollern dynasty. After Waldemar's death, his wife Agnes secondly married Duke Otto of Brunswick-G√∂ttingen in December 1319. When Waldemar's ward Henry II died in July 1320, the Brandenburg branch of the Ascanian house died out in 1320. As a reverted fief, the margraviate fell back to the Wittelsbach king Louis IV. In 1323, he enfeoffed his eldest son Louis with Brandenburg, ignoring the claims of the Ascanian princes of Anhalt. False Waldemar In 1348, an impostor appeared in the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and successfully claimed that he was Waldemar, returning from pilgrimage to the Holy Land after somebody else had been buried in his place. Quickly gaining support due to the rivalries between the Wittelsbach and Luxembourg dynasties, King Charles IV reinvested him for about two years before \\"the last Ascanian\\" was unmasked and fled to the Anhalt court in Dessau, where he spent the rest of his life.

A simulation of The Open Championship, it allows the player to engage in multiple forms of golf, including stroke play and fourball. The player competes at reproductions of the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews as and against famous golfers of the time. Announcer commentary is provided by actor Michael Bradshaw and Wide World of Sports host Jim McKay. British Open Championship Golf was the third self-published game released by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title Mean 18. The team sought to create an accurate simulation of tournament golf play, which they felt was missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive crowds and announcers. The game was placed in competition with popular golf series such as Links and PGA Tour. The game was a major commercial failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was leveled against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity. Gameplay The player, as Sandy Lyle, prepares to shoot for the first hole on the Old Course at St. Andrews. The semi-circular \\"swing meter\\" curves around the golfer. British Open Championship Golf is a three- dimensional (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt to hit a ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play‚ÄîPractice, Match and Tournament‚Äîare available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches. Before making a shot, the player may select a club and adjust the general direction of the swing. As with other golf games, a \\"swing meter\\" is used to simulate the act of swinging the club. The player clicks three times: first to initiate the backswing, which causes a timing indicator to move along the meter; second to begin the downswing; and third to \\"snap\\" the shot, which determines accuracy. Changes in the timing of these clicks alter the shot. A red section on the far end of the swing meter represents overswinging, which negatively affects shots. The crowd reacts to the player's shots, and Tournament mode features announcer commentary that analyzes the match overall; it can frame the player's current performance in the light of past shots. The player may choose one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie provides information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole. Development The Old Course at St. Andrews‚Äîthe oldest golf course in the world‚Äîhad never before been authorized for reproduction in a video game. Looking Glass Technologies began developing British Open Championship Golf in 1995. The project was led by Rex Bradford, designer of the influential 1986 golf title Mean 18. He had also worked on earlier Looking Glass games, such as Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri. Bradford decided to revisit the golf genre because he felt that other games did not recreate the structure or capture the atmosphere of golf tournaments; he complained that golf titles took place on \\"The Lonely Planet of Golf\\". The team sought to fill this perceived void by more accurately simulating the tournament experience, with a particular focus on crowds, commentary, atmosphere and the caddie. Bradford believed that these elements recreated \\"the television-style ambiance of being in that moment.\\" Graphically, a focus was placed on buildings and animated objects, in order to make up for the less spectacular nature of links courses. The game's environments were generated with the same stereophotogrammetry techniques used to create the landscapes in the company's earlier Flight Unlimited. The team's reproduction of the Old Course at St. Andrews was the first ever authorized for a video game. Looking Glass officially announced British Open Championship Golf on July 18, 1996. Coinciding with this news, the company launched a website to cover The Open Championship of 1996; it detailed both current events and the history of the tournament and its courses. According to Bradford, the company was \\"hoping to make a splash\\" with the game, which was placed in competition with popular series such as Links and PGA Tour. He noted the quality of these titles, and stated that, had the team not been trying to innovate, they would not have attempted to compete in the genre. Looking Glass revealed in November 1996 that Jim McKay, host of the Wide World of Sports, would provide color commentary for the game. Actor Michael Bradshaw was hired as the play-by-play announcer. The pair recorded more than 5,000 lines of dialogue in total. In January 1997, Looking Glass and Eidos Interactive announced a four-year partnership. As a result, British Open Championship Golf was distributed and marketed in North America and published in Europe by Eidos. However, like Flight Unlimited and Terra Nova, the game was self- published in North America by Looking Glass. In March 1997, near the end of the game's development, part of the team moved to Thief: The Dark Project; this included Mark Lizotte, who became that game's lead artist. British Open Championship Golf was released on April 30, 1997. That May, Looking Glass collaborated with golf website GolfWeb to host a \\"Virtual British Open\\" tournament. Players competed in the game to win a trip to The Open Championship in Scotland, complete with \\"air fare, hotel accommodations and spending money.\\" Reception British Open Championship Golf was a commercial failure. Following its release, Looking Glass ceased self-publishing operations and closed a division of the company, laying off a group of employees that included Warren Spector. Writing for Maximum PC, T. Liam McDonald called the game \\"a costly bomb that bled the company.\\" Looking Glass employee Tim Stellmach later characterized it as \\"a disaster\\". However, it was generally well received by critics. A reviewer for Next Generation Magazine hailed it as \\"one of the best golf games in years\\", praising the atmosphere and calling the graphics \\"among the best ... around.\\" The writer cited the game's lack of a course editor as its main downside, and summarized, \\"If you are looking for a golf simulation, this one delivers.\\" PC Magazines Shane Mooney highlighted its \\"outstanding graphics\\" and detailed course reproductions, and noted that it \\"[immerses] players in a realistic tournament atmosphere.\\" The writer considered the inclusion of only two courses to be the game's \\"one major drawback\\". Jeff Guinn of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called its graphics \\"exceptional\\", and considered the game to be \\"far from the traditional aim/swing links pseudo-challenge.\\" However, he found the game extremely difficult, thanks to its faithful reproductions of the challenging Old Course and Royal Troon. As a result, he considered the game to be ultimately \\"too much of a good thing.\\" A writer for the Telegraph-Herald praised its courses, and stated that its gameplay was a \\"state-of-the-art simulation\\". The reviewer believed that the tournament atmosphere had been \\"re-created faithfully.\\" Gary Whitta of PC Gamer US praised the game's graphics and atmosphere. While he liked its gameplay, he noted that it lacked the genre refinements seen in Links LS, a decision he believed would appeal to genre novices but not to veterans. He disliked Michael Bradshaw's commentary, but praised Jim McKay's for \\"adding much to the overall feel.\\" Ending his review, Whitta summarized it as \\"one of the most user-friendly, accessible, atmospheric and attractive golf games out there\\". Peter Smith of Computer Games Magazine found the game's swinging mechanics challenging, and noted that \\"making a dead-on accurate shot much more difficult than in any of the other golf games out there.\\" He found the mechanics of the putting green to be badly designed, which he cited as \\"an incredibly serious flaw that takes British Open Championship Golf out of contention for the gold cup.\\" Ultimately, he recommended Links LS and Jack Nicklaus 4 over the game, but suggested that future installments or patches might fix the issues. Computer Gaming Worlds Scott A. May wrote that \\"the game is solid, but ... somewhat unspectacular\\" compared to Jack Nicklaus 4 and Links LS. He stated that the links courses gave the game \\"a somewhat desolate look and feel\\", and that, \\"Historic or not, the scenery is downright dull\\". The reviewer considered Jim McKay's commentary and the simulated physics to be the game's high points, and he believed that, \\"More so than any other golf sim, the reactive crowd and interactive caddie are ... totally integrated into play.\\" He summarized the game as \\"a very good simulation\\" that was somewhat deflated by its lack of multiplayer, course editing and match replays.

He was the founder of the Institute for Higher Studies on Unbelief, Religion and Cultures. Known for his prodigious philosophical production, Fabro was part of the scholastic revival of Thomism. One of his major contributions to twentieth-century philosophy was to draw attention to the notion of \\"participation\\" in Aquinas' metaphysics. Fabro was also interested in modern philosophy, particularly the relationship Kierkegaard's thought to Christian philosophy, the origins and nature of anthropocentrism in modern thought, and the critical analysis of \\"progressive\\" theology. Early life Fabro was born at Flumignano, Udine, in Northern Italy on August 24, 1911, to Angelo and Anna Zanello. He was the third of four children including two older brothers Antonio and Secondo, and a younger sister Alma Teresina. Until his fifth year, he suffered from a motor disease that prevented him from speaking though he was able to communicate via signs. He also suffered from anorexia and cried continuously. A local Capuchin Fr. Guardiano suggested visiting the \\"Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie\\" in Udine, after which he was cured.http://reazionaripostmoderni.blogspot.com/2009/09/padre-cornelio- fabro.html Accessed September 30, 2012 During the World War he contracted typhus but was cured by a military medical doctor. In the summer of 1915 he was operated on for Mastoiditis at the hospital of Udine where he remained till spring 1916. Consequently, his early schooling was received at the hands of his older brother. In 1922 he transferred to the \\"Scuola Apostolica Bertoni\\" of the Congregation of the Sacred Stigmata, better known as the Stigmatines, continued his schooling in grammar schools of the Order and graduated from ¬´Scipione Maffei¬ª Junior High school. On November 1, 1927 he entered the novitiate of the Stigmatines in Verona. He was ordained a Catholic priest on April 20, 1935, at St. John Lateran Basilica. Education In 1928 Fabro completed his pre-seminary studies and began studies of philosophy at the \\"Scuola Apostolica\\". After completing private studies at the Marian sanctuary at Ortonovo La Spezia in 1929 he transferred to the Curia Generalizia and International College of the Stigmatine Order at the convent of Sant'Agata dei Goti on via Mazzarino in Rome in order to begin his philosophy studies at the \\"Collegio Sant‚ÄôApolinare\\", the future Lateran University. In 1931, he completed his doctorate receiving the highest marks with a thesis entitled L‚Äôoggettivit√† del principio di causa e la critica di D. Hume (The Objectivity of the Principle of Causality and Criticism of D. Hume). This dissertation repeats the traditional criticism of Hume taught in the early 20th century. Fabro began studying for a Licentiate in theology at the Pontifical International Institute Angelicum, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, AngelicumMetafisica della partecipazione, Elvio Fontana, EDIVI 2011, 29 On December 20, 1934, he received a prize from the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas for his monograph entitled Il principio di causalit√†, origine psicologica, formulazione filosofica, valore necessario ed universale (The Principle of Causality, its Psychological Origin, Philosophical Formulazation, and Necessary and Universal Value). On September 8, 1934, Fabro was transferred to his Order's religious house at the Church of Santa Croce in Via Flaminia where he was assigned as church organist; he was to remain at Santa Croce until his death. Fabro resumed his studies in philosophy and theology at the Pontificium Institutum Internationale Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. On July 7, 1935 he obtained a licentiate in theology from the Angelicum.http://www.corneliofabro.org/ Accessed September 25, 2017 For the period of summer-fall 1935 Fabro was on scholarship at the ¬´Stazione Zoologica¬ª of Naples. In 1935-1936 he taught cosmology and psychology in Verona and studies natural science at the University of Padova. In 1936-1937 Fabro continued his study of theology at the Angelicum and received a doctorate on October 28, 1937 with a dissertation on the metaphysical notion of participation according to Saint Thomas Aquinas entitled La nozione metafisica di partecipazione secondo S. Tommaso d'Aquino. Fabro published this dissertation as a book in 1939 with \\"Vita e Pensiero\\" of Milano. During the period 1936 to 1940 Fabro also taught biology, rational psychology, and metaphysics at the Lateran University. Career Upon completing his licentiate studies in philosophy and theology, Fabro began his teaching career, which was to last more than 40 years. In 1935, he taught his first courses at the Bertoni Apostolic School in Verona. From 1938 to 1940, he was ordinary university professor at Pontifical Urbaniana University, where he was first Extraordinary (1939) and then Ordinary Professor (1941) of Metaphysics. He later taught Philosophy of Religion (1948-1956; 1970-1973). In 1960, he founded the first ever Institute of the History of Atheism, which was later renamed Research Institute on Non-Belief and Culture. In 1948, he taught Theoretical Philosophy in the University of Rome. In 1949, he began teaching at Maria SS. Assunta (also known as LUMSA) and was the director of the Institute from 1954 to 1956. Fabro was invited in 1954 as Visiting Professor to give the Chaire Card. Mercier lectures at the University of Louvain on \\"Participation and Causality\\". These were published in 1960 in Italian and in 1961 in French. Fabro won the Chair of Theoretical Philosophy at the University of Naples in 1954. From 1956 to 1958, Fabro was Professor of Philosophy at the Faculty of Education and History of Philosophy at the Faculty of Letters at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan. Upon his return from Milan, Fabro resumed teaching at Maria SS. Assunta until 1965, when he began to teach at the University of Perugia. In 1965, Fabro taught at Notre Dame University (Indiana, USA) as Visiting Professor. While continuing to live and teach in Rome, Fabro simultaneously taught at the University of Perugia. In 1965, he was named Ordinary Professor in Philosophy. He was the head of Faculty of Education from 1965 to 1967 and Ordinary Professor in Theoretical Philosophy from 1968 to 1981. Thomistic metaphysics Fabro's contributions to Twentieth-century Thomistic metaphysics are many. According to Fabro, being is first grasped by the intellect in an apprehension and not by means of an abstraction or a judgment. He distinguishes between being-in-act (esse in actu) and being as act (esse ut actus). The former is able to be said of accidents, the substance, principles of being, etc., while the latter is reserved for the actuating principle of being. With regard to the notion of participation, Fabro introduces a distinction between predicamental participation (characterized by univocal predication) and transcendental participation (characterized by analogical predication).

Early life and education MacDonald grew up in Cornwall, Ontario, where she became active in the local independent rock music scene. She put on shows and creating a fanzine called Saucy, which gained attention outside of Cornwall as well. Dubbed the \\"punk-rock valedictorian,\\" she also grew into politics. She served as a student trustee on her school board at the age of 17. She left Cornwall to attend the University of Toronto. Career Returning at age 20, MacDonald ran in the 1999 provincial election as the New Democratic Party candidate in the electoral district of Stormont‚ÄîDundas‚ÄîCharlottenburgh. Facing two redistributed incumbents (Liberal John Cleary and Tory Noble Villeneuve) for a single seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, she was given next to no chance to win the election. Her innovative campaign strategy, including the use of a guerrilla theatre play called Revolution Mall Style, drew praise and attention.Leah Rumack, \\"Politics, punks and puppets: Is Cornwall ready to send riot grrrl to Queen's Park?\\" , NOW, May 20‚Äì26, 1999 Her mother, Elaine MacDonald, was an NDP candidate in the 2004 and 2006 federal elections in the redistributed riding of Stormont‚ÄîDundas‚ÄîSouth Glengarry MacDonald's second play, A Clockwork Gorbachev, won the Hart House Playwrighting Award in 2000 and the Robertson Davies Award For Playwrighting in 2001. She began to pursue her musical interests, and joined The Hidden Cameras, with whom she has performed since 2001. She has also been a member of several other bands at the same time. The first was Barcelona Pavilion, with whom she recorded a 7\\" single. After she left this band, she formed The Dating Service. For a time, she was a guest vocalist with Kids on TV, recording \\"Bitchsy\\" for the Lesbians on Ecstasy remixes LP Giggles in the Dark, released in 2005. Most recently she has been the lead vocalist with Republic of Safety, whose first EP, Passport, came out in March 2005. Their second EP, Vacation, was released in the spring of 2006. At the same time, she has had comics and writing published in Toronto publications: The Globe and Mail, Lola and Broken Pencil. In 2005, MacDonald published her first book, Kill the Robot. A science fiction novel critiquing consumer society, it is also illustrated by MacDonald. Her second play, The Rat King, first previewed as a work in progress in early 2004, received a public reading in the spring of 2005 and finally premiered as a full production in January 2006. Later MacDonald approached Bob Wiseman to collaborate on writing music for the songs. The Rat King was then mounted a second time in August 2006 as part of Harbourfront's \\"Indie Unlimited\\" series and later at the New York Fringe Festival.

Previously he retired as chairman of HSBC Holdings plc on 26 May 2006, after spending 45 years with the bank. He was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Chief Executive's Council of International Advisers in the years of 1998‚Äì2005. Career John Bond joined The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as an international manager in 1961, at the age of 19, his original application having been turned down before the intervention of the father of an old school friend whose father was a broker for the bank. He spent his early career in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, before returning to Hong Kong to manage the bank's investment banking arm Wardley in the 1980s. From there, he was posted to New York City, to head the bank's United States operations (which included Marine Midland Bank), before being appointed HSBC Group CEO in 1993. Bond took over as Group Chairman in 1998 with the retirement of Sir William Purves. During Bond's tenure as chairman, HSBC extended its reach well beyond its major franchises in Hong Kong and Britain. From 1998 to 2005, HSBC spent $47bn on acquisitions, including those of Republic National Bank, Credit Commercial de France, Bital Bank, Bank of Bermuda, and Household International. He was chairman when the Household acquisition was approved in 2003 by the Board. Household was a consumer finance business, an established business in the US serving the 40% of the US population who are sub-prime; other major players were GE, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and AIG. During his Chairmanship HSBC invested over $3 billion in China by buying 20% stakes in Bank of Communications and Ping An Insurance, as well as investing in HSBC's proprietary branch network. He chaired both the China Development Forum and the Mayor of Shanghai's International Business Leaders' Advisory Council and joined the Advisory Board of Tsinghua School of Economics and Management. Bond led HSBC to devoting considerable resources to corporate social responsibility, recognising the bank's responsibilities to the environment and the communities in which it operates. He was also behind HSBC's strong interest in the demographic changes being wrought by an ageing world. His management style is modest, and in interviews Bond preferred to discuss HSBC rather than himself. He attributed his rise to the top of HSBC as a result of being in the right place at the right time. In an interview in 2005, he noted being driven more by a fear of failure, of letting down shareholders, customers and staff, rather than a sense of personal aggrandizement. Bond was a director of Ford Motor Company. He has been a governor of the English-Speaking Union, and was chairman of the Institute of International Finance from 1998 to 2003. On 28 November 2005, HSBC announced that Bond would step down as chairman from May 2006, to be succeeded by the bank's CEO, Stephen Green. It was later announced that Bond would be taking over from Lord MacLaurin as chairman of the British telecommunications company Vodafone. In February 2011 he was succeeded by Gerard Kleisterlee as the Vodafone chairman. Bond became chairman of the mining conglomerate in March 2011 Xstrata. Personal information He was born in Oxford, and educated at Tonbridge School. His family's roots are in Bristol. Bond failed to gain admittance to Oxford University, so on leaving school he spent his gap year in the US, as an English-Speaking Union scholarship student at Cate School, near Santa Barbara, California, before being given passage on a ship from Long Beach to Hong Kong as a deck hand. Bond is married to Elizabeth, Lady Bond, with whom he has two daughters and a son. His elder daughter Annabelle Bond is the fourth British woman to have climbed Mount Everest and the woman to have scaled the Seven Summits in the briefest period of time. He was knighted in 1999 for his services to banking. In 2005, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York City, during the International Achievement Summit in New York City. In 2006, he received the Outstanding Leadership in Business Practices Award for his achievements in propelling HSBC‚Äôs growth through a series of outstanding acquisitions in America and Asia, and in creating an internationally recognized global banking brand. In March 2007, at the European Business Awards, he was given a lifetime achievement award.

These river regions include such valleys in the northern Sierra Nevada mountains of California as: Indian Valley, American Valley, Butte Valley, and Big Meadows. Maidu may also refer to the related Konkow and Nisenan languages.  History  The pre- contact Maidu peoples lived in a hunting and gathering society in parts of central California. These peoples lived in an area around what are now called Mount Lassen, Honey Lake, Sacramento, and Lake Tahoe. They spoke closely related languages, including the living Maidu, Konkow and Nisenan languages, along with the Chico language and other extinct variations.  Revitalization efforts  Farrell Cunningham, one of the youngest fluent Yamani Maidu speakers, taught \\"Mountain Maidu language classes in Greenville, Susanville, Nevada City and Auburn\\", and was active with the Maidu Theater in Nevada City, until his death on August 11, 2013, at age 37. Active language revitalization efforts have been underway since 2004. As of 2011, classes in Maidu were available in Nevada County, California. The Maiduan language family is considered to belong to the Penutian language group, along with such families as Miwok, Wintun, Yokuts, and Ohlone. Phonology Notation: In the phonological discussion, phonetic symbols are encased in slashes / /, allophones are in brackets [ ], while symbols in parentheses ( ) represent non IPA orthography. =Consonants= Maidu has eighteen consonantal phonemes. The consonants listed below are from the transcription system used by Shipley. The equivalent IPA transcription is listed in brackets when it differs from Shipley's orthography. {class=wikitable style=text-align:center !colspan=2 !Labial !Alveolar !Palatal !Velar !Glottal - !colspan=2Nasal m n    - !rowspan=3Stop !voiced b […ì] d […ó]    - !tenuis p t c [c~t É] k  î - !ejective p º t º c º [c~t É º] k º  - !colspan=2Fricative  s   h - !colspan=2Approximant w l j   } In the 1950s and 1960s, older speakers retained palatal stops /c, c'/ where younger speakers used an innovative palatal affricate [t É], [t É º], perhaps under influence from English. The notation /j/ represents the palatal glide, the same as the spelling y in English yes. The voiced plosives (/b/ & /d/) are implosive, but do not contrast with simple voiced stops. Before the velar plosives /k, k'/, /m/ is pronounced as [≈ã]. =Vowels= There are six phonemic vowels in Maidu. Once again, the chart comes from the orthographic system employed by Shipley. {class=wikitable style=text-align:center ! !Front!!Central!!Back - !High '' - !Low '''''''' } These six vowels are characterized by several different allophones depending on the phonetic environments in which they occur (initial/noninitial, stressed/unstressed, and open/closed syllables). The base phone of the vowels occurs in initial open syllables with stress. The lowest and most central allophones occur in unstressed closed syllables. According to Shipley, (a) and (y) have allophones that almost converge once they have centralized, (i) and (u) have allophones that barely centralize and drop slightly lower, approaching […™] and [ ä]. Meanwhile, (e) and (o) have more change than (i) and (u) but less than (a) and (y). Vowel length is nonphonemic, and changes according to the vowel's place within the word. The vowels can exhibit vowel lengths of less than a mora, one mora, or 1.5-2 morae. The vowel is less than one mora in unstressed syllables, around one mora in closed stressed syllables, and more than one mora in open stressed syllables. =Syllables= The syllables in Maidu follow a basic CV or CVC structure. The majority of words consist of alternating consonants and vowels, while combinations such as CVCVCCV also occur. In all cases, the syllables are consonant initial, and diphthongs do not occur in the coda. The syllables in Maidu display pitch in conjunction with the stress in the word. Syllables with the primary stress in the word have a higher pitch and tend to be more tense and have longer vowels. Secondary stress occurs with a low to middle pitch and lengthening of the vowel. Weak stress has a low to middle pitch and short vowels.  Morphology  Notation: In the morphology section, some notations are used to refer to changes occurring to the morphemes when they are conjugated or combined with one another. 'I' indicates a change whereby the preceding word goes through the following changes: after a vowel (V) of a vowel and glottal stop (V') the root remains the same, so /wepa/ remains /wepa/. After a k or k', the preceding vowel is duplicated, so /banak'/ becomes /banak'a/. In all other cases i is added, so /jaman/ becomes /jamani/. 'R' indicates reduplication of the previous segment, so /my/ becomes /mymy/. =Nouns= Maidu nouns are divided into two classes. The first class consists of kinship terms, but these do not include the terms for child and son. The nouns of this class are more limited in use than other nouns, as they are always subject to possession by another noun. These terms, such as /ne/ 'mother' occur in conjunction with a pronoun or a demonstrative, as in: ‚Ä¢ nikne \\"my mother\\" ‚Ä¢ minne-your mother ‚Ä¢ myne-(that) mother The second class of nouns consists of free morphemes, and can be broken down into smaller subclasses based on the origin of the noun stem. The first subclass contains nouns whose root and stem are identical, such as /wepa/ \\"coyote.\\" The stem /kyle/ 'woman' is notable in that is usually occurs as /kyle/, but may alternate to /kylok/ when attached with suffixes to form 'old woman' and 'women.' The second subclass contains nouns that are formed from several different roots. This compound may be formed from two noun roots (/mom/ 'water' and /pano/ 'grizzly' become mompano 'otter'), a noun root and an auxiliary verb (/jask'ak/ 'skinny' and /no/ 'along' become jask'akno 'skinny man'), a noun root and a distributive suffix (/jaman/ 'mountain' and /R-to/ 'all around' become jamanmanto 'mountains all around'), noun roots and an unidentifiable morpheme (/k'am/ 'belly' and /pum/ 'membrane' with a meaningless morpheme /pu/ become k'ampumpu 'tripe'), and a noun root with a diminutive morpheme (and /sol/ 'song' and /I-be/ become solibe 'ditty.'). Pronouns The pronouns are /nik'/ first person, /min/ second person, /maj/ third person, and /my/ demonstrative. /maj/ does not occur in the singular, and so constructions using /my/ serve as the third person singular. These include in a noun construction ('that woman' for 'her'), singularly ('that one') and repeated ('that person'). Other than /maj/, there are no special plural forms of the pronouns, as they are inflected for number along with other nouns. Number Inflection in Nouns While English distinguishes between singular and plural, Maidu distinguishes singular, dual, and plural. These inflections are most often used in conjunction with the pronouns, and are much less commonly used with other nouns. Both dual /c'o/ and plural /cy/ suffixes have several allomorphs. Along with these, there is a second plural morpheme /t'yt'y/ which indicates both plurality and a diminutive sense. =Verbs= Maidu verbs consist of the verbal theme along a series of suffixes. Similar to nouns, the verb stems in Maidu result from several different sources. Some verbs, like /sol/ 'sing' are composed of a single simple root. Other verbs include a noun in the verb stem, such as /k'awba/ 'to dig a hole', which is a compound of /k'aw/ 'dirt' and /ba/ 'to dig.' Still other compound verb stems result from the conjunction of two separate verb roots, as in /t'ikc'e/ 'to believe', from /t'ik/ 'to have enough' and /c'e/ 'to see.' Like nouns, some verb stems include a component that has no meaning on its own, such as /bokweje/ 'to invoke', where /weje/ means 'to talk' and /bok/ has no known meaning. Still others are the result of a verb and an auxiliary verb, and finally a set of verbs involving motion uses /'y/ as its first compound. Verb Theme The verb theme is a combination of the verb stem along with one or more thematic suffixes. All thematic suffixes are optional, and thus may be excluded from the verb, with the base stem acting as the theme on its own. ‚Ä¢Causative ‚Ä¢Designation of verbal object ‚Ä¢Motion-Location ‚Ä¢Negative ‚Ä¢Aspectual ‚Ä¢Evidential Causative The causative suffix /ti/ indicates that the actor is causing an action to occur, as in ma dondom 'as te 'ynotik'as, which means 'I walked the child, holding his hand' or 'I caused the child to walk, holding (his) hand.' This morpheme also occurs in words like /wonoti/ 'to kill', literally 'to cause to die.' Verbal Object The designation of the verbal object takes five different forms. /'us/ is a reflexive suffix, as in wonoti'us'am 'he killed himself.' The second suffix, /jo/ indicated both plural object and repetitive actions. This occurs in c'ani majse 'ono wojomak'as 'I'm going to hit them (one after another) on the head with a stick,' and humbotmenwet 'as hesbopajodom 'I kept on shoving anything into the sack.' The third suffix is used commonly and appears to have an obscure meaning. /to/ can be used with /ju/ 'rub on' to form juto 'rub in' and with /mej/ 'give' to form mejto 'buy.' It may work to create the transitive form of a verb, although this is not always the case. /toto/, a reduplication of /to/ indicates reciprocal action. Motion-Location The motion-location auxiliaries occur as 16 different suffixes. -/c'ik/ over or into with the implication of closing or covering /puc'ik/ 'to swell shut' -/c'o/ up and over the edge, around from behind -/daw/ down and away without and indication of a goal in the movement -/dik/ up to and into a goal or objective -/doj/ upward /weledoj/ 'to run up' -/je/ hither -/kit/ downward -/k'oj/ away from here -/lek/ hurriedly -/mit/ onto or into with an implication of downward motion -/n/ downstream, downhill (usually implies southwest) -/no/ along, no implication of direction or attitude /weleno/ 'to run along' -/paj/ against, usually figurative /jodotpaj/ ' tie up/, /haspaj/ 'to urinate against (as a dog would)' -/pin/ hither, no implication of goal -/sip/ out of /t'upsip/ 'spit out' -/t'a/ on top -/waj/ apart Some of these suffixes can occur together in limited constructions: /c'opin/ 'up over the edge and hither', /c'ono/ 'over the edge of something; in a circle', /noje/ 'aimlessly', and /sippin/ 'out of and hither'. /doj/, /kit/, /k'oj/, and /mit/ all lose their final consonant before the suffix /nu/, which indicates duration. /by/-/doj/-/nu/ becomes bydonu 'to stick up'. Negative The negative suffix /men/ has two variants, /men/ after a consonant and /n/ after a vowel. kyloknonom 'as wetemmen'usan 'the women didn't use to dance' and monma'amkano 'you won't' Aspectual The aspectual class contains six suffixes. -/bos/ completion wejebosk'as 'I'm through talking' -/c'yj/ unable hybonam jysipc'yjk'as 'I can't get out of the house' -/doj/ inchoative nik'i lenom 'as jotitdojdom kak'an 'My garden is beginning to bloom and become green' -/nu/ durative -/ti/ for the sake of -/bew/ a little more mym p'ybem 'as lalambewk'an 'That boy got a little taller' Evidential The evidential class consists of three individual morphemes. -/c'oj/ quotative mym majdyk mykotom 'ac'oj'am 'It was that man's grandmother, it is said' -/wew/ evidential mym p'ybec'om 'as 'ydojwewk'an 'Those two boys are apparently coming up' -/ky/ seems hes hututini wejepem kakyk'an 'How crazily he seems to talk' Verb Inflection The verb is completed by the addition of five inflectional suffixes. These suffixes mark the verb for expression of tense, aspect, mode, person, and number. There is variability in the ordering of these suffixes. There are five possible inflections for mode: indicative, subjunctive, optative, interrogative, and gerundial. Separate indicative modes occur for present- past, future, habitual past, and past punctual. The optative mode can be split into monitive, intentive, and hortatory. 'Present-past indicative: The present-past indicative is marked by a null morpheme. /sol/ 'to sing' becomes solk'as 'I sang', sol'amk'as 'we two sang, sol'emk'es 'we all sang', sol'amkano 'you sang', or solk'an 'he, she, they sang'. Plurality is marked only in first person, otherwise 2nd and 3rd person have no marking to differentiate duality or plurality. This tense of the verb is used to express a recently completed action, a punctual action that is taking place, a state of being, an equation (something is something else), or a present static location. Future indicative: Future indicative is marked by /ma/. solmak'as 'I will sing', solma'amk'as 'we two will sing', solma'emk'es 'we all will sing', solma'amkano 'you will sing', and solmak'an 'he, she, they will sing'. Future indicative indicate a future punctual action, a directive or a mild imperative. Other Pasts: the habitual past, marked with /'/ for past and /us/ for habit, indicates an action that was habitually done in the past, such as weje'usas 'I used to talk', or penem nikkotoc'om 'yhej'usan 'My two grandmothers used to go along'. The past punctual indicative, marked simple with /'/, is a rare verb tense. This form refers to a single act in the past that is disconnected from the current context. Subjunctive: the subjunctive mode, marked with /k'e/, occurs only with /jak/ 'resemble' and /na/ 'result in', such as jakk'es 'I seem to be'. Optative: The optative mode occurs in three different forms. All three forms are marked with the morpheme /b/. The monitive optative, marked with /y'y/, indicates a possible future event that is unpleasant or undesirable in nature, such as wonoby'ys 'I might die'. Intentive optative occurs only in first person to indicate intention, and sometimes is also used with demonstrative or interrogative words to form questions relating to instructions. Use with the singular form is common, while dual and plural are relatively rare. yk'oj'is 'I'm going to go' The hortatory optative is marked by /a/, and usually uses /t/ as an allomorph of the optative marker. This form indicates the idea 'let' as in yk'ojtas 'let me go'. Interrogative: The interrogative mode is marked with /k'ade/, as in solk'ades 'am I singing?'. Imperative: The imperative mode is marked by several different morphemes, depending on how the action is to be carried out. /pi/ is used when the action is to be carried out in the presence of the speaker, as in c'enopi 'Look!'. /pada/ is used when the action is to be completed in the absence of the speaker. Syntax = Noun case suffixes = Nouns must receive one of ten possible case markings. These cases are classified into four external distribution classes. These classes are subject, object, possessive, and locative. The cases are: ‚Ä¢Subject ‚Ä¢Object ‚Ä¢Possessive Subject: The nominative case is marked either by the addition of an /m/ such as /wepam/ from /wepa/ 'coyote' or the deletion of the final consonant as in /ni/ from /nik/ 'I'. Nominative is used for the performer of a verb, both A and B in a sentence where A=B, naming, and for the vocative. Object: The object case also has two allomorphs. The first is the I form, as mentioned in the morphology section, so that /jaman/ becomes /jamani/ 'mountain'. Other nouns have no change, as in /nik/ 'I'. This case is used for the direct and indirect objects, and is also used by some speakers in naming. Possessive: The possessive case is marked by /Ik'/ or /Ik'i/, as in /wepak'i/ 'coyote's', as /i/ as in /niki/ 'my', or as /k'i/ as in /mink'i/ 'thy'. Possessive is used to refer to both actual possessors (Coyote's flour) and figurative or characteristic possessors (the white man's flour), as well as in some cases to indicate 'for the sake of'. These next seven cases all belong to the locative class: ‚Ä¢Comitative ‚Ä¢Instrumental ‚Ä¢Locative ‚Ä¢Allative ‚Ä¢Ablative ‚Ä¢Indefinite locative ‚Ä¢Linear distributive Comitative:The comitative is marked by /Ik'an/ or /k'an/ and means 'along with'. wepak'an 'along with Coyote' Instrumental: The instrumental case is marked with /ni/ and is used to indicate the means by which something is done or with something as an ingredient. nik?opam jaluluni solti'usan 'my grandfather used to play on a flute' or mym mahatim kak'an wolek'i lawani japem 'that bread is made with white man's flour'. Locative: The locative case is marked with /di/. This case indicates a static location in space, the space within which an action is carried out, a static location in time, or 'toward'. kuludi kak'as 'ynojbodukkym 'I seldom walk around in the dark'. Allative: The allative case is marked with /nak/ or /na/. This case usually means 'toward' and rarely means 'for'. mym huskym c'ajna lykk'ojam 'the snake crawled to another place' Ablative: The ablative case is marked by /nan/ and is the marker for movement away from something or the origin of an object. wolenan 'as 'uni mek'as 'I got this from the white man' Indefinite locative: The indefinite locative is marked with /te/. This case is used very rarely, and usually indicates a location unknown to the speaker. homonte mink'i wat'a dakym 'where is your dishtowel?' Linear distributive: The linear distributive is marked with /no/. Like the indefinite locative, this case is used very rarely. This form marks a location with the meaning of 'along' or 'alongside of' and always occurs in conjunction with a noun indicating something with a linear form. 'adom 'unim sewno momi kutidom t'uc'ikdom sewi 'odo tawalwonom 'Then, draining out all of the water along this river and damming up the river, they worked the gold.' =Word order= There are several different word classes that go into making a Maidu sentence, split into the major and the minor classes. The seven major distribution classes are Subject, Object, Possessive, Locative, Finite Verb, Dependent Verb, and Copula. The minor classes are Connectives, Hesitation forms, Emphasis marker, Temporal Absolute, Adverbial Absolute, Interjection, and Question word. All together combinations of words from these classes make sentences. Subject, Object, and Locative Phrases The only way to expand upon the Subject, Object, or Locative is with a preceding Possessive. These connections can only occur with a single pair of words, one Possessive plus the Subject, Object, or Locative. Verb phrases Expansions of the Verb occur only with an Object. The Verb and the Object have an unrestricted arrangement. Both V-O and O-V occur naturally. The only exception to this free word order occurs when there are two object. When there are a pair of objects, usually a dependent and an independent object, the word order is restricted to O-O-V or O-V-O. The word order V-O-O never occurs. Basic clause The basic clause in Maidu contains one Verb phrase, between zero and two Subject phrases, between zero and four locative phrases, and possibly one Possessive phrase. Clauses with a Possessive are limited to a single Subject phrase. The phrases are relatively unrestricted in word order. The only exception is that Possessives always go clause finally. The most common word order is Subject-Locative-Verb. The Verb is usually clause final, except in cases where the Possessive is present. The Subject and Locative may occur within an expanded verb phrase, making Verb- Subject-Object and Adverb-Locative-Verb potential sentence constructions. : : : See also * Maidu * Maiduan languages References Bibliography *Anderson, Karen Lahaie.

Shark! is an Intellivision game originally designed by Don Daglow, and with additional design and programming by Ji-Wen Tsao, one of the first female game programmers in the history of video games. The player is a fish who must eat smaller fishes in order to gain points and extra lives while avoiding enemies such as larger fishes, sharks, jellyfish, lobsters and crabs. After eating a certain number of fish, the player's fish grows in size and is thus able to eat a larger selection of fish. However, while the larger fish becomes a bit faster, he is less agile than the small fish and has a harder time avoiding enemies. Shark! Shark! was originally considered by Mattel to be a cute game for kids and unlikely to make strong inroads into the gaming community. The game was unexpectedly popular, forcing Mattel to quickly manufacture another batch of cartridges. The original cartridge run was only 5,600 units. Legacy * Shark! Shark! was made available for the PlayStation 3 through PlayStation Home in fall 2012 in a collection titled Intellivision Gen2. In addition to players being a fish eating other fish trying try to take down the shark, their food and foes will both swim in a wide variety of new patterns. It was also released on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs in May 2010. * An updated version of Shark!

Man-to-man wargames offer an extreme challenge to the designer, as fewer variables or characteristics inherent in the units being simulated are directly quantifiable. Modern commercial board wargaming stayed away from man-to-man subjects for many years, though once the initial attempts were made to address the subject, it has evolved into a popular topic among wargamers. Man-to-man wargames have been a popular pastime for PC and console gamers, though \\"true\\" man-to-man combat simulators are much more rare than action-adventure oriented first person shooters which can probably be excluded from the topic of man-to-man wargames. Early role-playing games were derived from skirmish wargames, and many are still played as such. Many early designs for man-to-man games had cumbersome pre-plotting of moves, others used a system of multiple maps and umpires to try and create \\"fog of war\\" or uncertainty for players. Modeling conflict at this scale provides unique challenges to the game designer, who must find a way to quantify variables such as human behaviour at an individual level; games at higher (grand strategic, strategic, operational or tactical) levels can arguably have their variables more easily quantified.

Ambush! is an innovative solitaire game based on a system of paragraph readings and a sleeve-and-card system that reveals data about the game environment as the player navigates his soldiers over the map. Set in the European Theatre of Operations in WW II, it spawned three sequels as well as a second series of games set in the Pacific (Battle Hymn) as well as a two-player version (Shell Shock). Up Front is a man-to-man game, but its board was abstracted with the concept of relative range and range chits. The game was driven by cards, with individual soldiers represented by cards laid on a playing surface. Firepower was arguably the most detailed man-to-man treatment; there were, for example, arrow counters to indicate which side of a tree a soldier might be lying behind.

Most FPS games, such as Medal of Honor or Call of Duty, are not realistic simulations mainly due to the maze-like environment, scripted storyline, and unrealistic casualty assessment. The focus of these games is individual action-adventure rather than simulation in a dynamic tactical environment. More realistic man-to-man \\"shooters\\" for the computer are known as tactical shooters; an example is Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. OFP and its sequels allow the player to give limited tactical commands to an entire squad of men while still engaged in a first person perspective, and in online play several dozen players could take on individual personas in various small-unit missions. Fatal and non-fatal wounds to the player's character were realistically implemented. While storylines were still heavily scripted for solo play, this actually increased the level of realism in the simulation. Third-person man-to-man games have not been successfully translated to the computer in any large numbers. They include third-person shooters and tactical role-playing games. Notable examples of third-person man-to-man games on the computer include: *Sniper! (CompuServe, late 1980s) - a computer version of the boardgame, found on CompuServe. *Avalon Hill's Squad Leader (MicroProse, 2000) - based on Soldiers at War, Jagged Alliance, and X-COM, this was a man- to-man game with true fidelity to man-to-man board wargaming, being turn- based. It was not well received commercially or critically. *Silent Storm (Nival Interactive, 2003) *GI Combat (Freedom Games, 2002) *Eric Young's Squad Assault (Matrix Games, 2003) - a rework of the unsuccessful GI Combat by the same developer. *Computer Ambush (SSI, 1984) - The game came with two laminated village maps for players to plot moves on. Each unit was a single soldier. Players would take turns giving their soldiers orders, then the computer would process the moves and display the results to each player before they could enter their next set of orders.

Filmed in G√∂reme Open Air Museum's early Christian churches, it stars opera singer Maria Callas in her only film role. She does not sing in the movie. Plot Jason, an exiled prince, is raised to adulthood by Chiron, a centaur. Chiron encourages him to see the beauty and sacredness in reality, but also realizes that Jason will become rational, lose any sense of spirituality, and travel the world as an adventurer. When he becomes a man, Jason confronts his uncle, Pelias, who had killed Jason's father and usurped the throne. Pelias tells Jason he will restore the throne to Jason if he can travel to Colchis and retrieve the Golden Fleece. Jason assembles his Argonauts and they endure a difficult voyage. In Colchis, Medea leads her people in fertility rite. A young man is offered up as a human sacrifice and his organs and blood are sprinkled over the crops in a ritual sparagmos. Jason arrives, and though he has been terrorizing the surrounding countryside, Medea immediately falls in love with him. With the aid of her brother Absyrtus she steals the Golden Fleece for Jason. They join the fleeing Argonauts, but the Colchians pursue them. Medea kills her brother and dismembers his body. Her father's men are then forced to halt and retrieve the scattered pieces of his son's body, enabling Jason and Medea to escape. When they return to Jason's homeland, Pelias reneges on his promise. Deciding the fleece has little power after all, Jason accepts this decision. Medea is stripped of her ornate ethnic garb and dressed in the garments of a traditional Greek housewife. She bears Jason two sons. But he grows tired of her and decides to pursue a political marriage to a Corinthian princess, Glauce. Chiron reappears to Jason, as both a centaur and a human, to remind Jason that this is his and Medea's destiny. The enraged Medea plots revenge against Jason and his new bride and sends Glauce a robe bewitched with magic herbs. Although Medea intends for the poison to cause the princess and her father, Creon, to burst into flames; instead Glauce and Creon are driven insane and leap to their deaths. Medea kills her and Jason's sons and sets fire to their house. Held back by the fire, Jason pleads with Medea to let the children have a proper burial.

The group was active from 1978 through 1988, and had a new wave/art rock sensibility that was strongly influenced by minimalism. History =Founding and early years (1978-83)= Tirez Tirez was founded by Missouri native Mikel Rouse, and gave its first performance as the opening act for the rock band Talking Heads at a 1978 concert in Kansas City, Missouri. The band's initial line-up was Rouse (vocals/guitar), Rob Shepperson (drums) and Jeff Burk (bass). Tirez Tirez issued two very rare self-released LPs in their earliest days: No Double Bagging Necessary (1978) and Rush & Dissonance (1979). All three members of the group subsequently moved to New York City in 1979, and self-released their debut single (\\"Scattered\\"/\\"Scenery\\") in November of that year. The band's third album (1980's Etudes) was recorded in New York City, but it did not initially see a US release, and was at first only picked up for distribution by the tiny British independent label Object Music. The LP went on to sell a very respectable 2,000 copies in the UK, and US indie Aura Records later issued in the album in the US in late 1981. Aura also issued \\"Razorblades\\", a single taken from the album. Bassist Burk left Tirez Tirez in 1982, and was replaced by James Bergman. Philip Johnston (keyboards/woodwinds) was also added to the group at about the same time. This line-up (Rouse/Shepperson/Bergman/Johnston) recorded 1983's Story Of The Year, which was released only in Europe via Belgian label Les Disques Du Cr√©puscule. Although he had left Tirez Tirez, original band member Burk would continue to contribute finished artwork to future Tirez Tirez album and single releases after his 1982 departure; the same would be true of original drummer Shepperson after his departure in early 1984. =Creation of Broken Consort (1984-85)= In 1984, Rouse would begin recording more minimalist work with his instrumental \\"chamber orchestra\\" Broken Consort. From this point forward, Tirez Tirez and Broken Consort often featured identical memberships, although each group had a distinctly different repertoire. For the first album credited to \\"Mikel Rouse Broken Consort\\" (1984's Jade Tiger) the band line up of Rouse/Shepperson/Bergman/Johnston was exactly the same as that of Tirez Tirez's Story Of The Year. In 1984, Tirez Tirez released the Europe-only non-LP 12\\" single \\"Under The Door\\" / \\"Sleep\\". The only credited musicians on this release were Rouse (guitars/keyboards/synthesizers/percussion/vocals) and, on the A-side only, Blaine L. Reininger (violin/bass programming). In 1985, bassist Bergman re- joined the fold in time for the Broken Consort LP A Walk In The Woods. The same year, the Rouse/Bergman duo (augmented by saxophonist Ellery Eskelin) also recorded the Broken Consort album A Lincoln Portrait, although it was not released until 1988. =Major label releases and break-up (1986-93)= In 1986, Tirez Tirez (now officially a duo of Rouse and Bergman) issued the non- LP 12\\" \\"Set The Timer\\" / \\"Uptight\\" on Sire Records. This was their first US release in five years, and their first release to receive major label distribution. Shortly after the release of \\"Set The Timer\\", the group found a permanent US home with the IRS label. For their fifth album (1987's Social Responsibility), the band was still a duo of Rouse and Bergman, with Rouse performing all instruments except bass. The band expanded to a quintet for a subsequent tour, and for their final studio release, 1988's Against All Flags, Tirez Tirez's line-up consisted of Rouse (vocals/guitar), Bergman (bass), and new members Bill Tesar (drums), Rave Tesar (keyboards) and Mark Lampariello (guitar). According to Mikel Rouse's web site, one further Tirez Tirez album was recorded after 1988, but it was never released. Rouse slowly phased out Tirez Tirez over the next few years, while continuing to work with many of the same musicians; in addition to Rouse, the 1993 line-up of his Broken Consort ensemble consisted of Tirez Tirez players James Bergman (bass), Bill Tesar (drums), and Mark Lampariello (guitar), along with non-Tirez member Dale Kleps (woodwinds). Tirez Tirez was still listed as a going concern in the liner notes to the 1993 Broken Consort release Soul Menu, but both groups wound down shortly thereafter. Rouse continues to live in New York City, and since 1994 has performed and recorded as a solo artist.

It was the capital of the erstwhile Princely State of Nabha until 1755 when Raja Hamir Singh founded Nabha town and made it the capital of the state. He also built a fort which now houses the police station of Dhanaula. A temple of Hanuman exists here. It is said that a man was digging a ditch and found an idol of Hanuman. A temple was constructed at that place, the idol was placed there, and the people began to worship it. Dhanaula is a town of temples. A fair known as Hanuman Mela is held in this temple on every Tuesday. Dhanaula is also known for Vd.

Waldenstr√∂m painted in 1914 by Carl Larsson Paul Petter Waldenstr√∂m (alternately spelled \\"Paul Peter\\") (20 July 1838 ‚Äì 14 July 1917) was a Swedish theologian who became the most prominent leader of the free church movement in late 19th century Sweden. Waldenstr√∂m was born in Lule√• in northern Sweden, son of a district physician. He began his academic studies at Uppsala University in 1857, completed his Ph.D. degree there in 1863, and was ordained a priest in 1864. He had been employed as an adjunct in the V√§xj√∂ h√∂gre allm√§nna l√§roverk (the secondary school in V√§xj√∂) already in 1862 and in 1864, when his doctorate qualified him for this, received a lecturership in Christianity, Greek and Hebrew at the secondary school in Ume√•. From 1874 until 1905 he was lecturer in the same subjects at the secondary school in G√§vle. He was awarded a Doctor of Theology degree from Yale University in 1889 and was awarded the laurel for a second time as a jubeldoktor (\\"jubilee doctor\\") in Uppsala in 1913. Work in the free church movement Although he worked as a school teacher his whole life, Waldenstr√∂m's notability comes from his work as a theologian, editor of Christian periodicals, and a preacher. He was long a leading member of the Swedish Evangelical Mission (Evangeliska fosterlandsstiftelsen), a movement within the state church, but was among those who left the organization in 1878 to form the Swedish Mission Covenant (Svenska missionsf√∂rbundet, since 2003 the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden, the Svenska missionskyrkan), which long had an ambivalent relationship to the state church, torn between the relative moderation of Waldenstr√∂m and the greater radicalism of the first president Erik Jakob Ekman (1842‚Äì1915) and his followers. After Ekman's resignation in 1904, Waldenstr√∂m became the president of the society. In 1868 he began editing Pietisten (\\"The Pietist\\"), which was a publication associated with the free church movement. This proved to be very influential both in Sweden and abroad; in America, the Evangelical Covenant Church was greatly influenced by his life and writings. Theological contributions Waldenstr√∂m's influence can be partially summed up in the maxim often associated with his movement: \\"where does it stand written?\\" (Swedish: Var st√•r det skrivet?). This cry reflects his passion for the Bible. The fact that Waldenstr√∂m spent 11 years translating the New Testament from Greek to Swedish shows his devotion to the Holy Texts. His influence is not limited to translation and exegesis. He led an active political life and wrote on a variety of theological topics. He wrote a book titled \\"Baptism and Infant Baptism\\" (Swedish: Dop och Barndop). But perhaps his greatest legacy is his understanding of Justification and Atonement. He rejected that the prevailing notion that God's wrath was satisfied by the cross because it made God the object of reconciliation and lacked scriptural support. He instead asserted that humanity, not God, was the object of the Atonement; that God was the initiator, not the recipient, of the work of reconciliation in Christ.

He is the author of many works in both Galician and Spanish, including Merl√≠n e familia (\\"Merlin and family\\"). He was a cofounder of the Galician Writers Association. In 1991, Galician Literature Day was dedicated to him.  Life  Cunqueiro was born to Joaqu√≠n Cunqueiro Montenegro, a pharmacist, and Pepita Mora Moir√≥n of Mondo√±edo (where he was infamous for his practice of stealing coats at parties). He did his bachillerato (secondary school) studies in the Instituto Xeral e T√©cnico (General and Technical Institute) in the city of Lugo, where he befriended the writers Evaristo Correa Calder√≥n and √Ånxel Fole. He began to study in the Department of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Santiago de Compostela in 1927, but abandoned his studies to dedicated himself to journalism, writing for various newspapers and magazines including El Pueblo Gallego. During his time in Santiago, he regularly attended the literary gatherings at the Caf√© Espa√±ol, and his friends included Francisco Fern√°ndez del Riego, Domingo Garc√≠a Sabell, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, Ricardo Carballo Calero, Carlos Maside, and Xos√© Eiroa. He promoted the magazines Papel de Color and Galiza, and edited the first issue of the latter, published July 25, 1930. He was a founding member of the Partido Galeguista (Galicianist Party). The military uprising of July 1936 found Cunqueiro in Mondo√±edo, and thanks to the influence of his conservative family, he was not subjected to reprisals, and was able to find work as a teacher in a private school in Ortigueira from October 1936 onwards. He was the regional head of press and propaganda for the Falange, and worked on the local Falangist publication Era Azul. Jes√∫s Suevos, the head of the Falange in Galicia, and the director of the newspaper El Pueblo Gallego, asked him to write for the newspaper's literary and current events sections; Cunqueiro accepted and moved to Vigo. During his time in Vigo, he also briefly taught Portuguese in a high school. In November 1938, Cunqueiro moved to San Sebasti√°n and wrote for La Voz de Espa√±a. He was also a subdirector for V√©rtice, a publication of the National Delegation of Press and Propaganda, in which he published \\"The Story of the Knight Rafael\\" (1939), his first fiction in Spanish. After Madrid was occupied by the Nationalist army, Cunqueiro moved there and began to write for ABC. In 1947 he returned to Mondo√±edo and began to distance himself from Franquism. In 1950 he published a book in Galician, Dona de corpo delgado. From 1960 on, he worked as the official chronicler of Mondo√±edo, and the following year moved to Vigo, where he found a fixed position as a writer for the newspaper Faro de Vigo. In 1961, the Royal Galician Academy elected him as a member. Between November 1964 and June 1970, Cunqueiro was the director of the Faro de Vigo and of the Faro Deportivo. Literary Work He was a multifaceted writer, and his extensive literary output extends into the fields of journalism, poetry, narrative prose, and theater, not to mention his work as a translator. The early Cunqueiro was fundamentally a poet, writing in Avant-Garde, neo-troubador and culturalist styles. He initiated neo- troubadourism with his poetry collections Mar ao norde (1932) and Poemas do si e do non (1933). He wrote Cantiga nova que se chama Riveira (1933) under the influence of the troubador tradition of the medieval Galician-Portuguese lyric. During the 1940s and 50s, he began to dedicate himself primarily to narrative and journalism, publishing three important novels: Merl√≠n e familia e outras historias, As cr√≥nicas do sochantre and Se o vello Simbad volvese √°s illas. He also published three books of stories: Xente de aqu√≠ e de acol√°, Escola de menci√±eiros, and Os outros feirantes. The latter was turned into a series of six stories adapted for the screen by prestigious Galician and Spanish actors. He also wrote innumerable articles for newspapers like Vallibria, La Voz de Galicia, El Progreso, and Faro de Vigo. He received the Premio de la Cr√≠tica Espa√±ola in 1959 for Las cr√≥nicas del sochantre, which in reality was a translation of the Galician-language As cr√≥nicas do sochantre, which he had written first. He was also awarded the Premio Nadal in 1968 for Un hombre que se parec√≠a a Orestes and the Premio Frol da Auga in 1979 for Herba de aqu√≠ e acol√°. For his work as a journalist he received the Premio Conde de God√≥. In 1981 he was named an honorary member of the Galician Writers Association. Cunqueiro was the source of the famous quote Mil primaveras m√°is para a lingua galega (\\"A thousand more springs for the Galician language\\"). This phrase now figures on his grave: Eiqui xaz algu√©n, que coa s√∫a obra, fixo que Galicia durase mil primaveras m√°is (\\"Here lies someone who, with his work, made Galicia last a thousand more springs\\"), alongside another inscription that reads Loubado se√±a Deus que me permitiu facerme home neste grande Reino que chamamos Galicia (\\"Praised be God who allowed me to become a man in this great Kingdom we call Galicia\\").

Her music is \\"hip-hop inspired with punk rock abandon\\". Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario to Trinidadian parents, Nobel began writing music early, at the age of 14, then performing studio recordings at 17. Nobel tributes several genres as an influence; as is evident in her performances which encompass various genres normally regarded as incompatible.  Life and career  Nobel, born in Toronto to Trinidadian parents, was exposed to the musical styles of parang and calypso and soca of the Trindadian culture, as well as reggae music. Nobel began theatre at a young age allowing her an early introduction to the arts. She discovered hip hop in her teenage years, which inspired her to explore her creative abilities as an artist. Nobel, upon reflection of her growth as an artist, cites the video for \\"Bonita Applebum\\" by a Tribe Called Quest as a muse for such creative possibilities. Writing her first songs at the age of 14, Nobel would begin to perform studio recordings 3 years later under the Canadian producer 2Rude. Nobel‚Äôs hip-hop inspired ambition of becoming an emcee led her to move to New York, in hopes of immersing herself in the city‚Äôs hip-hop scene. After returning from New York City, she continued to explore new genres and push creative boundaries. However, Nobel‚Äôs passion for exploring new sounds conflicted with the interests of her female hip-hop group, Gravity, causing the group to split on creative differences. Nobel would later find the multi-instrumentalist, producer Martin \\"Doc\\" McKinney, producer of Esthero, Res, Sting, Hawksley Workman, and The Weeknd (Nobel would later write songs and record with Esthero, Hawksley and extensively with Res). Nobel became part of Black Corners collective, a collection of artists who chose a \\"progressive approach to music\\", avoiding the boundaries of a single genre. Together, Nobel and Doc experimented with various genres including rock, hip-hop, and electronica. In the process, Nobel developed a distinct sound, incorporating atmospheric guitars, hip-hop beats, heavy bass lines, samples, string arrangements and innovative programming. Nobel continued to work with Doc until 2006. In 2007, she made recordings with labels Aftermath (Dr. Dre, Che Vicious, Mark Batson) and BME (Lil Jon). In May 2008, Nobel became the third member of the electro-rap group Idle Warship alongside (Talib Kweli and Res) releasing their \\"Party Robot\\" mixtape (October 2009).

Bana was a thousand-armed Asura king, and the son of Mahabali.krishna.com - Glossary description Some other sources say that since Banasur, son of Asur King Mahabali who is believed to be a central character in mythology and culture of Kerala, inherits his kingdom from his father and is believed to have ruled from Kerala. There is a hill named \\"Banasur Hill\\" and a dam, \\"Banasur Sagar Dam\\" dedicated to the memory of their great ruler's son Bana. Legend Krishna forgives Banasura Banasura, a mighty asura, once ruled over a large kingdom. His influence was so strong and fierce that all the kings - and even some of the devas - shuddered in front of him. Banasura used to worship a Rasalingam given to him by Vishvakarman, on instruction from Vishnu. An ardent devotee of Shiva, he used his thousand arms to play the Mridanga when Shiva was performing the tandava dance. Shiva gave Banasura a boon and the latter requested Shiva to be his protector: therefore, Banasura became invincible. As time passed, he became even more cruel and arrogant. He locked up his daughter, U·π£ƒÅ, in a fortress called Agnigarh because many young suitors had come to him asking for her hand. One day, Usha saw a young man in her dream and fell in love with him. Chitraleka was a friend of Usha and daughter of Kumbhanda, Minister of Banasura. Chitralekha was a talented artist who helped Usha to identify the young man seen in her dream by sketching various portraits. She had dreamt of Aniruddha, the grandson of Krishna. Chitralekha, through supernatural powers, abducted Aniruddha from the palace of Krishna and brought him to Sonitpura. Upon meeting Usha, Aniruddha too fell deeply in love with her. When Banasura, came to know about this affair, enraged, he caged Usha in a fortress over a hillock, bounded by fire from all sides. This hillock is situated in the heart of present-day Tezpur. Bana sent guards to seize Aniruddha, but he fought valiantly and defeated them. Bana then by using the powers granted to him by Shiva, bound him with snakes and imprisoned him too. In the meantime, Narada narrated the entire series of events to Krishna. Krishna, along with Balaram, Pradyumna, Satyaki, lead the twelve Akshauhinis of the army. They seized Sonitpura from all sides. Bana also attacked Krishna‚Äôs army with equal might, but he began to feel powerless in front of Lord Krishna. Thus, he evoked Lord Shiva to take his side. Shiva, confined to his abode along with his son Kartikeya, came to his aide. A tumultuous battle ensued between the two Lords, which became a spectacle among all other Gods, heavenly beings and sages. Banasura began to see his defeat, then he called Lord Shankar to fight in the war, thus Lord Shankar and Shri Krishna started the great war which lasted for many days. Krishna finally put Shiva to sleep using Jurumnastra. After Shiva, falls into a slumber, Krishna recalls his discus, and uses it to cut Bana's thousand arms systematically, like the branches of a huge tree. Seeing Krishna releasing his Sudarshan Chakra to sever his head, Banasura once again invokes Lord Shiva. True to the plight of his devotee, Shiva aroused from his slumber, approached Krishna and asked him to spare Bana‚Äôs life. After that Krishna forgave Bana.https://www.harekrsna.com/philosophy/associates/demons/dwarka/banasura.htm After the war, Aniruddha married Banasura's daughter Usha who later gave birth to Vajra, grandson of Pradyumna and the great-grandson of Krishna and Rukmini. Family 347x347px The genealogy of Banasura is as follows:Bhaleram Beniwal: JƒÅt YodhƒÅon ke BalidƒÅn, Jaypal Agencies, Agra 2005 * Brahma's son was Marichi * Marichi's son was Kashyapa, * Kashyapa's sons were Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha, * Hiranyakashipu's son was Prahlada, * Prahlada's son was Virochana, * Virochana's son was Bali, * Bali's son was Banasura Banasura's story has been narrated in Indian epic Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana. His story as the rejected suitor for goddess Shakti is present in Tamil Sangam literary works Manimekalai and Puranaanooru; Bhattavataar's Banasura Katha.  Legacy  * According to Hindu mythology, Agnigarh hillock was built by Banasura to keep his daughter Usha in isolation. * Mahabhairav Temple is believed to have been established by king Bana with a Siva lingam. Formerly, this temple was built of stone but the present one is built of concrete. During the later years, the Ahom kings donated devottar land for the Temple and Pujaris and Paiks were appointed to look after the temple. * To the east of Tezpur town, on the bank of river Brahmaputra a temple call Rudrapada is situated. It is believed that Rudra ( Lord Shiva ) had left the print of his left foot (pada) on a stone found in the temple. It is believed that Mahadeva showed his real self to king Bana here. *Banasura Sagar Dam is named after Banasura because he was the son of Mahabali and as per local belief Mahabali was a very respected king of Kerala.

An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues. Classic blues were performed by female singers accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles and were the first blues to be recorded. Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and the other singers in this genre were instrumental in spreading the popularity of the blues. History =Origin= Blues, a type of black folk music originating in the American South, were mainly in the form of work songs until about 1900.Fabre and Feith 2001, p. 100. Gertrude ‚ÄúMa‚Äù Rainey (1886‚Äì1939), known as \\"The Mother of the Blues‚Äù, is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and comedy around 1902.Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 38,Harrison 1988, p. 34. Rainey had heard a woman singing about the man she had lost, learned the song, and began using it as her closing number, calling it ‚Äúthe blues\\". Rainey's example was followed by other young women who followed her path in the tent show circuit, one of the few venues available to black performers. Most toured through a circuit established by the black-owned Theatre Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.) on the East Coast and through the South as far west as Oklahoma. A key figure in popularizing the blues was the composer W. C. Handy, who published the first of his blues songs in 1912.Randell 2003, p. 104. His compositions, notably \\"The Memphis Blues\\" and \\"St. Louis Blues\\", quickly became standards for blues singers. Songs modeled on Handy's were performed in black stage shows and were also performed and recorded by white vaudevillians, such as Sophie Tucker.Harrison 1988, p. 44. Lieb 1981, p. xi. =1920s= In 1919, Handy and the Harlem songwriter and music publisher Perry Bradford began a campaign to persuade record companies that black consumers would eagerly purchase recordings by black performers. Bradford's persistence led the General Phonograph Company to record the New York cabaret singer Mamie Smith in its Okeh studio on February 14, 1920. She recorded two non-blues songs, which were released without fanfare that summer but were commercially successful.Harrison 1988, p. 46 Smith returned to the studio on August 10 and recorded \\"Crazy Blues\\", the first blues recorded by a black woman.Stewart- Baxter 1970, p. 12. The record sold over 75,000 copies in its first month, an extraordinary figure for the time. Smith became known as ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs First Lady of the Blues‚Äù. In November 1920, the vaudeville singer Lucille Hegamin became the second black woman to record a blues song when she cut \\"Jazz Me Blues\\".Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 16. Ethel Waters, Alberta Hunter, Mary Stafford, Katie Crippen, Edith Wilson, and Esther Bigeou, among others, made their first recordings before the end of 1921.Harris 1994, pp. 48, 137, 254, 484, 540, 580. Blues had become a nationwide craze, and the recording industry actively scouted, booked and recorded hundreds of black female singers. Blues recordings were marketed exclusively to African Americans, largely by advertisements in black newspapers such as the Chicago Defender and the Pittsburgh Courier, and were typically labeled \\"race records\\" to distinguish them from records marketed to white audiences. However, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were popular with white buyers,Steinberg and Fairweather 2011, p. 159. for instance, Hegamin's recordings for Paramount Records in 1922, which were issued as part of Paramount's \\"popular\\" series rather than its \\"race\\" series.Smith, Chris (1995). CD liner notes. Lucille Hegamin: Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order, vol, 2: 1922‚Äì1923. Document Records DOCD-5420. Marion Harris meanwhile became the first white female singer to credibly record the blues with tracks such as her versions of \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" and \\"Beale Street Blues\\". Annette Hanshaw also made some blues recordings, such as \\"Moanin' Low\\". Bessie Smith was the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s The most popular of the classic blues singers was Tennessee-born Bessie Smith, who first recorded in 1923. Known as the ‚ÄúEmpress of the Blues\\", she possessed a large voice with a ‚ÄúT‚Äôain‚Äôt Nobody‚Äôs Bizness if I Do‚Äù attitude. Smith (who was unrelated to Mamie Smith) had toured on the T.O.B.A. circuit since 1912, originally as a chorus girl; by 1918 she was appearing in her own revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey.Harris 1994, pp. 462‚Äì463. She struggled initially to be recorded‚Äîthree companies turned her down before she was signed by Columbia. She eventually became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s and recorded over 160 songs. Ma Rainey, whose popularity in the South was unrivaled, was little known in the cities of the North until 1923, when she made her first recordings.Harrison 1988, p. 35. She and Bessie Smith brought about a change in the style of the classic blues, as audiences came to prefer their rougher, earthier sound to that of the lighter- voiced, more refined blues singers who had preceded them on record.Stewart- Baxter 1970, p. 35. Rainey recorded over 100 songs, 24 of them her own compositions. According to the jazz historian Dan Morgenstern, ‚ÄúBessie Smith (and all the others who followed in time) learned their art and craft from Ma, directly or indirectly.‚Äù Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were Ida Cox, Clara Smith, Sara Martin and Victoria Spivey and her cousin Sippie Wallace. Spivey, inspired by a Mamie Smith performance to become a blues singer, achieved overnight success in 1926, when Okeh released her first recording, her original ‚ÄúBlack Snake Blues.‚Äù In 1929 she appeared in the first all-black talking film. =Decline and revival= By 1928, the popularity of the classic blues style was waning.Lieb 1981, p. xiv. With the success of the first commercial recordings of Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1926, a more \\"down-home\\", less urbane form of blues became popular, typically performed by men accompanying themselves on guitar or piano. The effect of the Great Depression on black vaudeville and the recording industry and also the trend toward swing music in the 1930s ended the careers of most of the classic blues singers.Harrison 1988, p. 61. Some, like Ethel Waters, adapted to changing musical styles; some, like Lucille Hegamin and Sara Martin, subsequently worked mainly outside the entertainment field; others, like Hattie McDaniel and Edith Wilson, became successful actors in film and radio. Bessie Smith died in a car crash in 1937, at the age of 41. Lionel Hampton was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúHad she lived, Bessie would‚Äôve been right up there on top with the rest of us in the Swing Era.‚Äù With the downturn in the popularity of female blues singers, beginning about 1933 and 1934, some of these artists began performing and recording what became swing blues. Singers like Lil Johnson, Memphis Minnie and Lucille Bogan started recording for the ARC group of cheaper labels and for Decca Records (after late 1934). Other 1920s female blues singers who later made swing blues records include Victoria Spivey, Ida Cox, and Bertha \\"Chippie\\" Hill. In the 1960s a revival of interest in the blues brought Sippie Wallace, Alberta Hunter, Edith Wilson and Victoria Spivey back to the concert stage. In 1961 Spivey started her own record label, Spivey Records. In addition to recording herself, she recorded Lucille Hegamin, Memphis Slim, Lonnie Johnson and others. Significance The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the record industry, among the first black singers and blues artists recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the 12-bar blues throughout the United States. Mahalia Jackson and Janis Joplin are among those who named Bessie Smith as an influence. According to LeRoi Jones, phonograph recordings of the classic blues singers \\"affected the existing folk tradition and created another kind of tradition that was unlike any other in the past\\".Harrison 1988, p. 8. Daphne Duval Harrison wrote that the blues women's contributions included \\"increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, Broadway musicals, torch songs of the 1930s and 1940s, gospel, rhythm and blues, and eventually rock and roll.\\" See also *List of classic female blues singers *Women in music Notes References *Albertson, Chris (1972).

The Commission, chaired by Archbishop Robin Eames, published its findings as the Windsor Report on 18 October 2004. The report recommended a covenant for the Anglican Communion, an idea that did not come to fruition. Background The 1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops passed a resolution on human sexuality stating that it \\"in view of the teaching of Scripture, upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union\\" and that it could not \\"advise the legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions\\". =Same-sex unions and Robinson's election= Bishop Gene Robinson One Canadian diocese, New Westminster, authorised a rite for the blessing of same-sex unions at its 2002 Diocesan Synod. The use of the rite by individual parishes was incumbent upon a specific request of the parish made through its annual vestry meeting or resolution of its parochial church council. In May 2003, six of the diocese's 76 parishes received authorisation to use the rite.Diocese of New Westminster, Information on Same- Sex Blessings Chronology of Actions taken by the Anglican Church Of Canada & the Diocese of New Westminster in regard to the Issue of Same Sex Unions . Accessed 2007-07-22. In 2003, the Episcopal Church's General Convention consented to the Diocese of New Hampshire's election of Gene Robinson as its bishop. Robinson's election prompted a group of 19 bishops, led by Bishop Robert Duncan of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, to make a statement warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, stated that it would \\"inevitably have a significant impact on the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be\\". He added, \\"It is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response\\". Retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu stated that he did not see what \\"all the fuss\\" was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria, stated that their churches were in an \\"impaired communion\\" with the Episcopal Church. As a result of the controversy over the consecration of Gene Robinson as bishop and the blessing of same-sex unions, on 15 October 2003, Anglican leaders from around the world met in Lambeth Palace in an attempt to avoid a schism on the issue. The day after, they released a lengthy statement: The Primates also asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to form a commission to provide \\"urgent and deep theological and legal reflection\\" to report back to the Primates in 12 months. Lambeth Commission on Communion In 2003, Archbishop Robin Eames, the Anglican Primate of All Ireland, was appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury as Chairman of the Lambeth Commission on Communion. This commission studied the state of unity in the Anglican Communion in light of the developments in the United States and Canada. The Commission published its findings, the Windsor Report, on 18 October 2004. The report did not adopt a view on homosexual practice, but nevertheless recommended a moratorium on further consecrations of actively homosexual bishops and public Rites of Blessing of same-sex unions,The Windsor Report 2004. On public Rites of Blessing of same sex unions. Accessed 2007-07-17. and called for all involved in Robinson's consecration \\"to consider in all conscience whether they should withdraw themselves from representative functions in the Anglican Communion\\".The Windsor Report 2004. On elections to the episcopate. Accessed 2007-07-17. However, it stopped short of recommending discipline against the Episcopal Church or the Anglican Church of Canada. The report also recommended solidifying the connection between the churches of the Communion by having each church ratify an \\"Anglican Covenant\\" that would, in part, commit them to consulting the wider Communion when making major decisions. It also urged those who had contributed to disunity to express their regret. Aftermath In February 2005, the issue of homosexuality was heavily discussed at a regular meeting of the Primates of the Anglican Communion at Dromantine in Northern Ireland. Of the 38 Primates, 35 attended. The Primates issued a communiqu√© that reiterated most of the Windsor Report's statements, with the addition that The Episcopal Church USA and Anglican Church of Canada were asked to voluntarily withdraw from the Anglican Consultative Council, the main formal international entity within the Anglican Communion until the next Lambeth Conference in 2008.The Primates' Meeting February 2005 Communique. Accessed 2010-03-03. The Windsor Report was criticised by liberals (for example, in The Windsor Report: A Liberal Response) for seeming to take for granted that the actions of New Hampshire and New Westminster‚Äîand homosexuality in general‚Äîwere wrong. For example, while it calls for both conservatives and liberals to apologise for disunity, it acknowledges that the conservatives may have acted out of a sense of duty. However, it concedes no such acknowledgement to New Westminster and New Hampshire. On February 12, 2008 the Archbishop of Canterbury announced the formation of the Windsor Continuation Group (WCG). The WCG was formed to address the remaining questions around the Windsor Report and the various formal responses to the Windsor Report from the provinces and instruments of the Anglican Communion. The WCG was chaired by Bishop Clive Handford.Press Release. Anglican Communion News Service Archbishop of Canterbury appoints Windsor Continuation Group . Accessed 2008-07-23. Anglican Communion Covenant In 2006, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, established the Covenant Design Group (CDG) to draft a covenant for the Anglican Communion. The CDG met between 2007 and 2009, producing three successive drafts: the Nassau Draft Covenant (2007), the St. Andrews Draft Covenant (2008), and the Ridley Cambridge Draft Covenant (2009). Each draft was indebted to previous ecumenical covenants that Anglicans had either proposed or entered into. The origins of Anglican ecumenical covenants date to the 1964 British Conference on Faith and Order, although this was indebted to the ecumenical covenanting which the World Council of Churches endorsed in 1948. However, since the late 1960s, Anglicans have discussed and debated several plans for greater integration of the Anglican Communion. Most recently, these proposals have incorporated significant discussions of canon law. The Anglican Covenant depends upon these discussions as well. The final text of the covenant was sent to the provinces of the Anglican Communion in late 2009. As of June 2012, the covenant has been acceded to by seven provinces of the Anglican Communion: Mexico (2010), the West Indies (2010), Ireland (2011), Myanmar (2011), South East Asia (2011), Papua New Guinea (2011), and the Southern Cone (2011). The Church of Southern Africa took the initial steps towards ratifying the covenant in 2011, pending final approval in 2013. Two provinces rejected the covenant: the Church of England (2012) and the Episcopal Church of Scotland (2012). In the Church of England, the diocesan vote against the covenant was decisive but the popular vote was only narrowly against the covenant. It was expected that the Covenant would brought up for reconsideration in the next triennium, but this did not take place. Two provinces neither rejected nor embraced the covenant in full. On 9 July 2012, the General Synod of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia resolved that it was \\"unable to adopt the proposed Anglican Covenant due to concerns about aspects of Section 4, but subscribes to Sections 1, 2, and 3 as currently drafted to be a useful starting point for consideration of our Anglican understanding of the church.\\" This resolution further stated that the General Synod of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia \\"Affirms the commitment of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia to the life of the Anglican Communion; including the roles and responsibilities of the four Instruments of Communion as they currently operate.\\" Two days later, on 11 July 2012, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America chose to neither accept nor reject the Anglican Covenant, instead opting for a \\"pastoral response\\" that recognised the \\"wide variety of opinions and ecclesiological positions\\" within the province.Resolutions B005.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Joliet. One of the oldest Catholic high schools in the Chicago area, Joliet Catholic is perhaps best known for its prowess in football. Since the advent of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) state football playoffs in 1974, JCA has won more state football titles than any other team in the state, with 14 as of 2018. The modern school is itself the result of a merger between the all-girls St. Francis Academy and the all-male Joliet Catholic High School, which itself was formerly known as DeLaSalle High School for Boys. It is this merger that results in the school's shared affiliation with the Carmelites and the Joliet Franciscan Sisters. History = Founding = The Joliet Franciscan Sisters opened St. Francis Academy in 1869 as an all-girls school. The academy was founded in a small stone building convent by Mother Mary Alfred Moes, who later would help found the Mayo Clinic. In 1923, the school moved to the campus of the University of St. Francis, which had opened in 1920. In 1956, the school moved to the building at 1200 N. Larkin, which is the current site of JCA. George Cardinal Mundelein, Archbishop of Chicago, had the De La Salle Christian Brothers create a new high school for boys as a part of their renovation of St. Patrick Church in Joliet. The school opened in 1918 as DeLaSalle High School for Boys with only two classrooms in the parish center, but moved to a new building in 1927. In 1933, the Carmelites took possession of the school, at which time, the school became Joliet Catholic High School. In the summer of 1990, Joliet Catholic High School and St. Francis Academy merged to form the modern Joliet Catholic Academy.\\"History of JCA\\" Academics A college preparatory high school, JCA places students in different academic programs based on their middle school grades, scores on the incoming freshmen placement exam, and scores on other applicable exams.

By April, a sting operation dubbed \\"Operation After- School Special\\" yielded the arrests of five JCA students and four others connected to selling cocaine and ecstasy to an undercover officer. Eight of the nine people arrested were convicted for their part in selling drugs at JCA. Since the scandal, JCA has implemented a drug testing procedure in which all students are tested in the first semester, with a random sample of 25% of students being tested again in the second semester. The procedure requires a hair sample from the student that, when properly analyzed in a laboratory, should reveal the presence of most major drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, the drugs at the center of the infamous 2006 bust. Although new data is unavailable, JCA \\"touts [a high] drug testing success rate\\" of 99.996 as of 2012. = Racist Social Media Post and the Alumni Coalition for Change at JCA = In May 2020, amidst Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's death, a former Theology teacher and Respect Life Club leader liked a post on Facebook that many interpreted as endorsing racist violence against BLM protesters. The post has since been removed, though the text is quoted in an online petition. After a screenshot of the liked post gained social media attention, alumni began to comment on their experiences with the teacher in question and with racism and homophobia at JCA, SFA, and JCHS over the years. In response, JCA released a statement that condemned the post and racism generally. The post did not mention the teacher by name or whether he would face any consequences. By June, the newly formed Alumni Coalition for Change at JCA released its own statement via the Joliet Patch, calling for the removal of the teacher in question, as well as for * \\"Updated English and United States History curriculums that acknowledge police brutality, slavery and systemic racism. * Cultural diversity, sensitivity, and implicit bias training for current students, staff and incoming freshmen. * Equal consideration for alumni scholarships and other grants beyond Empower Illinois. * Improved hiring practices overseen by a Director of Equity and Inclusion that focus on hiring black, indigenous, and people of color educators to better represent the diversity of the student body. * Resumption of the student teaching program with the University of St. Francis to provide opportunities to local students seeking a future in education.\\" A petition supporting the Alumni Coalition also calls for JCA to make a statement explicitly saying \\"Black Lives Matter,\\" to meet with diverse alumni, and to strengthen teacher evaluations. JCA has yet to publicly comment on the Alumni Coalition, but has posted a new Director of Diversity and Inclusion position on their website. An online petition to \\"save\\" the teacher's job has also been created by a current student. [Link blocked by Wikipedia] However, on June 30, 2020, the teacher who liked the post tweeted what is seemingly a message of farewell. Joliet Catholic Academy has yet to comment on the status of the teacher's employment, nor have they advertised a need for a new Theology teacher.

The zeolite facies is generally considered to be transitional between diagenetic processes which turn sediments into sedimentary rocks, and prehnite-pumpellyite facies, which is a hallmark of subseafloor alteration of the oceanic crust around mid-ocean ridge spreading centres. The zeolite and prehnite-pumpellyite facies are considered burial metamorphism as the processes of orogenic regional metamorphism are not required. Zeolite facies is most often experienced by pelitic sediments; rocks rich in aluminium, silica, potassium and sodium, but generally low in iron, magnesium and calcium. Zeolite facies metamorphism usually results in the production of low temperature clay minerals into higher temperature polymorphs such as kaolinite and vermiculite. Mineral assemblages include kaolinite and montmorillonite with laumontite, wairakite, prehnite, calcite and chlorite. Phengite and adularia occur in potassium rich rocks. Minerals in this series include zeolites, albite, and quartz. This occurs by dehydration of the clays during compaction, and heating due to blanketing of the sediments by continued deposition of sediments above. Zeolite facies is considered to start with temperatures of approximately 50 - 150 ¬∞C and some burial is required, usually 1 - 5 km. Zeolite facies tends to correlate in clay-rich sediments with the onset of a bedding plane foliation, parallel with the bedding of the rocks, caused by alignment of platy clay minerals in a horizontal orientation which reduces their free energy state. Generally plutonic and volcanic rocks are not greatly affected by zeolite facies metamorphism, although vesicular basalts and the like will have their vesicles filled with zeolite minerals, forming amygdaloidal texture. Tuff can also become zeolitized, as is seen in the Obispo formation on the California coast.

Pusch Ridge Christian Academy is a ministry of Catalina Foothills Church, PCA. The school is accredited by ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International). History In 1958, Charles and Anna Egleston donated of pristine desert property in the foothills at the base of Pusch Ridge in the Catalina Mountains to Palo Verde Baptist Church, to be used \\"for religious and educational purposes only,\\" with a firm vision that the property would support a school grounded in Christian values and faith. The property was subdivided in late 1977 for the establishment of Canyon Del Oro Baptist Church on the southern 16 acres. The other remained undeveloped through 1982, when Max Wilford, the president of the Palo Verde Christian School Board directed the commencement of construction on the Egleston property. Wilford intended to relocate Palo Verde Christian School from its location in Tucson to the property in Oro Valley. In the fall of 1994, Palo Verde Christian High School opened its doors on the property in Oro Valley. This new location served grades 6-12, while grades K-5 remained at the Palo Verde Baptist Church property in Tucson. By early 2000, the school was struggling and it was at that time that the leadership of Catalina Foothills Church, PCA, wanted to open a Christian high school. Through the leadership of David Mehl and other members, ownership of the school transferred from Palo Verde Baptist Church to Catalina Foothills in early 2000. In February 2000, Pusch Ridge Christian Academy was officially established. The main entrance to the Pusch Ridge campus and Canyon Del Oro Baptist from North Oracle Road is named Egleston Memorial Drive in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Egleston, and North Egleston Drive running just east of the nearby James D. Kriegh Park also honors the Eglestons. Pusch Ridge currently has a K-12 enrollment of over 700 students. Mission \\"The mission of Pusch Ridge Christian Academy is to teach our students to become like Christ through a classical Christian education within a covenantal community.\\" Athletics The high school varsity girls' basketball team, coached by Lonnie Tvrdy, won the Arizona state championship four years in a row from 2005 to 2008, but were eliminated from the championship in February 2009. The high school varsity girls' cross- country team placed second at the 2011 State Meet at Cave Creek Golf Course for Division IV. The Pusch Ridge baseball team, coached by former major league pitcher Doug Jones, won the Arizona 2A state championship in 2009. The following year, under head coach Mark Frithsen, the Lions had an undefeated season led by team captains Alec Erceg, Owen Bertelsen, and Aaron Vaughn before being defeated in the semi-final game as they attempted to defend their state championship title. 2011 saw limited success for the Lions, who finished with a losing record but still made the playoffs, led by senior captains Kory Santaella, Colin Chafin, and Alfonso Ferrari. In the 2012 baseball season, Pusch Ridge made it to the state playoffs again but lost in the second round to eventual State Champs St. David. In the 2013 season Pusch Ridge lost in the third round. In 2014, the Lions went 26‚Äì5 and made it to the State Championship game. The team broke many school team records with their amazing season. The team was led by seniors Jacob Frithsen, Mike Doty, Ryan Penny, Chad Willis, Kyle Hammond and Phillip Tanner. Frithsen and Doty both had remarkable seasons pitching, while both pitchers posted an under 1.50 ERA. They were led on the offensive side where Frithsen, Penny and Tanner all had an average over .400. Frithsen, Doty, Penny and Tanner were all named to the Division 4 AZBCA All- Star game where the south won 14-6 and Frithsen earned MVP honors. He threw three innings only giving up one run and had a two-RBI single to get things started for the South. The team is coached by Mark Frithsen and Scott Polston. Lions football has seen great success in their history, mainly with Bob Vance at the helm. They made the playoffs and went undefeated in regional play for three straight years. Notable football players in Vance's tenure included Grayson Barghols, Greg Schimke, Ryan Polston, Andy Knox, Tyler Vance, Trevor Cook, Tyler Goodwillie, Ryan Tanner, John Jackson, Alfonso Ferrari, Colin Chafin, Ryan Alexander, Gordon Wilson, and Daniel Simmons. Schimke, Knox, and Simmons all went on to play college football. In the 2015 season the Lions won division 4 state championships against Northwest Christian.

Early life Albert Iremonger was born in Wilford, Nottinghamshire on 15 June 1884. He was the younger brother of James Iremonger and older brother of Harry Iremonger.  Footballing career  Although Iremonger never played at an international level, he was widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of his time and is a local legend in his home county of Nottinghamshire. It is also believed Iremonger was the tallest player in the league at the time, measuring 6 ft 5in.Nottingham Evening Post Bygones page 33 Friday 2 May 2008 editionThe Legends of Notts County, Dave Bracegirdle 2005 page 91 = Notts County = Albert Iremonger signed for Notts County from local minnows Notts Jardines, making his debut against Sheffield Wednesday on 1 April 1905. In total he made 564 appearances for the club making 211 consecutive appearances and holds the club record for this. Spending 21 years with the club, he totalled 37 FA Cup appearances over 22 seasons before leaving the club to join Lincoln City. His exceptional performances for the club earned him a Football League cap in 1912. As a testament to his character and legendary status within the community, a road behind the club's ground was named for him. It is still said amongst Notts County fans that he had \\"hands like the claws of a JCB\\". = Lincoln City= Albert Iremonger signed for Lincoln City aged 42, becoming their oldest ever player. Although he was a short-term signing, he made 35 appearances for the club from 1926 to 1927. = Temperament = Iremonger was well noted for his outspoken nature on the football pitch, which led to the end of his 211 consecutive appearances for Notts County. He would often leave his goal-mouth to argue decisions made by match officials sometimes situated in the centre of the pitch.  Cricketing career  Iremonger played county cricket for Nottinghamshire, his career spanning between 1906 and 1910. He played with a right-handed batting and bowling style.  Children  Albert Iremonger and his wife Margaret Iremonger fathered Albert Harvey Iremonger in 1920, who went on to become a Sergeant-Pilot in the RAF. He was killed in action on 14 July 1943, aged 27.Roll of Honour - Lincolnshire - Gedney Hill and District Memorial Hall Later life Much later on in his life, during the 1940s, Iremonger was the landlord of the Cremorne in The Meadows Nottingham and later The Ferry Inn Wilford before his death on 9 March 1958.

History =World War II= In late 1940, Congress authorized a naval air fleet of fifteen thousand aircraft. The Marine Corps was allotted a percentage of these planes to be formed into 2 air wings with 32 operational squadrons. On the advice of Navy and Marine advisors returning from observing the war in Europe these numbers were doubled very soon after. It was under this expansion program that the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing was activated in San Diego, California on 10 July 1941. Its first component was Marine Air Group Two which was based at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii. This gave 2nd MAW some of the oldest squadrons in Marine aviationDeChant Devilbirds p. . Although the Hawaii-based squadrons sustained extensive damage during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, 2nd MAW contributed to 83 South Pacific combat operations. Marines and aircraft from 2nd MAW participated in major battles or campaigns at Wake Island, Guadalcanal, Midway, Saipan, Tinian, Guam and Okinawa. 2d MAW served as the headquarters for the Tactical Air Force, Tenth Army during the Battle of Okinawa. During three months of combat over the skies of Okinawa, squadrons from 2nd MAW accounted for 484¬Ω planes shot down helping to create 21 new Marine Corps aces.DeChant Devilbirds, p. 241. Following the surrender of Japan, 2nd MAW retained its headquarters on Okinawa and sent Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31) to Yokosuka and other units to Omura and Nagasaki.DeChant Devilbirds, p. 251. In April 1946, 2nd MAW relocated to its present home at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. = Vietnam War = During the Vietnam War, 2nd MAW supplied combat-ready units and personnel to operations in the Asian Theater. = 1980s and 1990s = In the 1980s, 2nd MAW units were active participants in exercises and operations around the globe, to include those in Lebanon, Cuba, Grenada, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. The decade of the 1990s began with Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The millennium closed with 2nd MAW squadrons prosecuting and supporting NATO air strikes in Kosovo and Serbia during Operation Allied Force, and flying support during Operation Northern Watch from Incirlik, Turkey. =Global War on Terror= Marines from 2nd MAW headquarters prepare morning colors for the first time at the new headquarters building in 2008. From 2000 through 2002, EA-6B Prowler squadrons deployed in support of Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch and Unit Deployment Program rotations to Japan. AV-8B Harrier and helicopter squadrons deployed in support of the 22nd, 24th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units. F/A-18 Hornet squadrons deployed aboard the with Carrier Air Wing 3; and Marine Wing Support Group 27 and Marine Air Control Group 28 deployed personnel in support of all exercises and operations in which 2nd MAW flying squadrons were participating. In early 2001, VMFA-312 and VMAQ-3 participated in a joint combined strike against Iraq. This marked the first Marine Corps combat use of the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW). VMA-542 and HMM-261 flew combat missions over Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and conducted humanitarian missions in Djibouti. The Marines of VMA-542 were among the first to employ the LITENING 2 targeting pod in combat. In 2003, 2nd MAW deployed more than 7,700 Marines and Sailors in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Joint Task Force Horn of Africa. More than 200 tactical combat aircraft flew in support of these missions. They supported combat and contingency operations around the globe, with greater than 70 percent of the command and control, support group, and aircraft deployed simultaneously. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing units flew over 7,800 combat sorties, expended over 3.9 million pounds of ordnance, carried over 10,000 troops and 6.2 million pounds of cargo, built five base camps, two expeditionary airfields (EAFs), ten forward area arming and refueling points (FARPS) and three forward operating bases (FOBs). 2nd MAW eventually headquartered at Al Asad Airbase to serve as the aviation combat element of Multi-National Forces West for the remainder of the Iraq War. In the fall of 2009, the wing headquarters turned this mission over to Marine Aircraft Group 26 and returned home. As American forces end their missions in Iraq, 2nd MAW continues to support the War on Terrorism today in Afghanistan.

He studied under Joseph B√∂hm at the Vienna Conservatory from 1842 to 1845. Banished from Austria for participation in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, he went to Germany, where he befriended the 15-year-old Johannes Brahms and introduced him to Hungarian music. Pursued by German authorities, he fled to the United States in December, 1849. He returned to Europe in 1852, toured with Brahms in 1853, and then sojourned for a time at Weimar, where he received the benefit of Franz Liszt's instruction and friendship. In 1854 he became solo violinist to Britain's Queen Victoria. He obtained his amnesty in 1860 and returned to Hungary, being soon afterward appointed soloist to Emperor Franz Joseph.

He is an ordained non-pulpit serving Orthodox rabbi who serves as the Director of the Halacha Commission of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, a member of the Editorial Committee of the Orthodox Union's Jewish Action magazine, and a member of the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America. Biography Student was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, where his parents still live. In his youth, he attended a Conservative Jewish synagogue. He is an alumnus of Solomon Schechter elementary school and Frisch School, and a baal teshuva. A 1994 graduate of Yeshiva College, Yeshiva University, Gil Student is listed in the 2005 alumni directory as a rabbi and a quantitative analyst who works in financial reinsurance and lives in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn, New York and has served as president of Khilah Marine Park synagogue, led by Rabbi Baruch Pesach Mendelson. He is married and has four children and two grandchildren. Writing, blogging and publishing Student's writings appear mainly on the Internet on his old and his new blog, Hirhurim Musings. They also appear in newspapers and journals on a variety of Judaic topics including Jewish medical ethics and Yeshiva University. The Hirhurim blog was ranked \\"Best Jewish Religion Blog\\" and #3 in categories \\"Best Series\\" and \\"Best Overall Blog\\" for 2005 by The Jerusalem Post and has been cited in The Wall Street Journal for declining to run an ad for \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" by Sam Harris. He has received other recognition for his blogging and views by Yeshiva University's student newspapers The Commentator and The Observer. On August 1, 2013, Student announced that he was closing his blog stating: \\"I believe Hirhurim has run its course ... In my opinion, the ideas and dialogue have gotten stale ... It is time to move on to a new mission and format.\\" The website later relaunched and now states: \\"Torah Musings is a window into the Orthodox Jewish intellectual's world, providing sophisticated but popular textual studies, important news stories and associated commentary from the perspective of an Orthodox Judaism that is intellectually open and halakhically conservative.\\" Student owns and operates a small Jewish publishing house, Yashar Books, that, in addition to traditional Orthodox scholarly works, distributes the writings of Orthodox thinkers who defy the accepted norms of publications in the Haredi world; the latter include works that were previously distributed by prominent publishers such as Feldheim. His publishing company has undertaken to distribute the works of Rabbi Natan Slifkin whose books were banned by many Haredi rabbis as well as other works that are not openly approved by the Haredi mainstream rabbinate. In explaining his defense of Slifkin and his willingness to publish Slifkin's books, Student wrote in The Jewish Press, \\"The Jewish community is no stranger to conflict. Some controversies, however, transcend their local concern and reverberate in ways originally unintended. I believe we have witnessed such an event with the recent controversy surrounding three books about Torah and science by Rabbi Natan (Nosson) Slifkin. The bans promulgated on his books have come to represent more than just disapproval of those specific works; they have come to signify the lack of centralized rabbinic authority in our globalized world and the increased empowerment of the individual afforded by the Internet.\\" Defending the Talmud Student has written defending the Talmud against those who claim that it defames gentiles or Jesus. On the Internet, one of Student's sites called \\"Talmud: The Real Truth About The Talmud\\" states its objective: > There are many lies circulating the internet about the Jewish Talmud. These > allegations are supported by \\"direct quotations\\" from the Talmud that are > frequently wrong or taken out of context. However, most people lack the > scholarly background to verify these claims. Most people have no way of > knowing that these accusation are false and malicious.

Key areas discussed with relevant sources include: *About the Talmud *Alleged racism in the Talmud *Talmud's view of Jesus' personalities. *Jewish holidays *Immorality in the Talmud Position on Modern and Haredi Orthodoxy Though his stance in the Slifkin controversy put him at odds with much of the Haredi world, Student nevertheless opposes many trends within Modern Orthodoxy, especially regarding women's issues (e.g. women's prayer groups), taking a particularly strong stance against the now-defunct Edah organization; and other groups. In his personal life, Student remains involved with both the Haredi and Modern Orthodox worlds in Brooklyn. According to Student, \\"I live in a moderate Haredi neighborhood, attend Haredi synagogues, send my children to moderate Haredi schools but still maintain professional and friendly relations with the Modern Orthodox world.\\" Critique of Lubavitch messianism He has written on Chabad messianism in opposition to the claim by some Chabad Hasidim that the last Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, may have been the long-awaited Jewish Messiah (i.e. the Moshiach). See http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/ He has received both criticism and praise for his self-published book Can The Rebbe Be Moshiach? described as \\"Proofs from Gemara, Midrash, and Rambam that the Lubavitcher Rebbe cannot be Moshiach\\". In an interview with The Jewish PressThe Jewish Press, Friday, September 18, 2009, page 10 in September 2009, in response to a question if he can talk about his opinions on the Lubavitcher rebbe not being Moshiach, he replied, > I actually prefer not to. People get very offended by it. I wrote the book > for ba'alei teshuvah to let them know that there's more than one perspective > on the issue. I have no interest in fighting with Lubavitch. Attention on the Internet Student is often cited by rabbis belonging to the Rabbinical Council of America,Rabbinical Council of America (5 mentions on the RCA's website, direct access to this requires a password.) and eminent writers frequently respond to Student's writings and statements on their own websites and blogs. Richard John Neuhaus, responding to a blog post by Student on the New American Bible, writes: > Over on a blog called Hirhurim Musings, a Torah scholar by the name of Gil > Student takes on my critique of the Catholic translation known as the New > American Bible (NAB) in the current issue of FIRST THINGS.

He is best known for his non fiction writing covering a wildly divergent list of subjects: from the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria to genetics and behavior to true crime and grand opera. The great Harvard naturalist and author, E. O. Wilson, said of Wright's Born that Way, Genes, Behavior, Personality: \\"It takes an independent writer and free spirit to tell the story straight, and thank God Wright has done it.\\" In addition to Lillian Hellman, the Image and the Woman, Wright's books include The Von Bulow Affair, and two books with and about Luciano Pavarotti: Pavarotti, My Own Story and Pavarotti, My World. Biography Wright was born in Philadelphia, the son of William Connor Wright Sr. and Josephine Hartshorne Wright. He graduated from the Germantown Friends School and earned his B.A. at Yale University. In the U.S. Army, he completed training in Chinese at the Language School in Monterey, California and served as an Army translator and interpreter in Japan, Okinawa and on the . He lived for many years in New York City; and in later years, Key West, Florida. His longtime companion was the writer Barry Raine. Career After his Army service, Wright was an editor at Holiday magazine when it was located in Philadelphia and published the likes of John Steinbeck, V.S. Pritchett and Lawrence Durrell. When Holiday became a casualty of the Curtis Publishing Company's disintegration, Wright accepted a bizarre offer from composer Gian Carlo Menotti to become manager of Menotti's Spoleto Festival, then held only in Italy. Wright's job was to oversee the production of some ten events put on by the festival's U.S. side. Each of his events was successful, but the overall festival was a financial disaster. Unnerved, Wright resigned. After struggling for five years writing magazine articles, Wright accepted an offer to become the editor of Chicago magazine, which he did from 1969 to 1971. Although the magazine was well received by both Chicagoans and advertisers, his tenure was cut short when the magazine was closed down for making jibes at the elder Mayor Richard Daley. Although offered editorial positions at three other publications, Wright turned to writing full-time and continued to do so until a few years before his death, mostly authoring non-fiction books.

Cable TV usage is high (around 80%) and there is also a wide selection of newspapers available covering most political viewpoints.  Taiwan's media history  While Taiwan's media freedom may rank among the top few nations in Asia today, its progress to its current state of vibrancy was not without a struggle. The Japanese occupation of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945 did not slow down the pace of economic modernisation on the island; the Kuomintang (KMT, Nationalist Party) also built on the successes of its predecessors to modernize and this provided the basis for its mass media industry to develop. However, KMT's pursuit of economic progress and democratic ideals did not automatically mean that Taiwan's media could fulfill its role as the fourth estate of democracy, as a check on the government. The martial law era media was kept on a tight leash and the explicit prohibition from enquiring about then-President Chiang Kai-shek, reinforced the culture of deference to KMT politicians even further. It would not be surprising to observe mainstream media's close relations with the KMT regime, as the authoritarian nature of KMT determined media firms‚Äô business practices. Taiwanese media was structured to transmit the official ideology decided by the KMT, such as the emphasized Han Chinese identity over Taiwanese identity, in response to political and national security concerns as claimed by the latter. The official media's role in Taiwanese society was to communicate the government's decisions, mobilising people around its agenda and finding ways to work towards meeting the regime's objectives under the close supervision by the Government Information Office. In an effort to curb dissent, KMT promulgated the Enforcement Rules for the Publications Act in 1952, which effectively banned the establishment of any more new magazines, newspapers and news agencies during Taiwan's martial law era (1949‚Äì1987). From 1952 to 1987, there were 31 newspapers in Taiwan, and by 1974, 44 news agencies. Yet this did not seem to prevent dissenting voices from seeking its space in the public sphere and in response, the KMT began employing alternative methods to limit the opposition movement from gaining traction. The authors of material which offends the KMT were subjected to reprisals, where the KMT and government officials repeatedly filed criminal libel and sedition suits against them, which often resulted in jail terms. This period of harsh suppression has also been remembered as the White Terror in Taiwanese history, where high-profile and educated dissidents such as Professor Chen Wen-chen began to disappear. Under such circumstances, alternative radio and television channels continued to thrive in Taiwan as a subversive underground movement to push for democratization, freedom and civil rights, even though they were barred from establishing themselves on official airways. The underground media's status provided a focus for organised and sustained opposition to the KMT-dominated state, where its magazines provided a voice for the politically marginalised Taiwanese since it was not covered by the press ban. Specifically, the underground media brought the lives of KMT politicians under scrutiny and also brought opposition activists to the attention of their audience, familiarising the people with their names and platforms. This convergence of opposition ideologies in the underground media scene also saw the beginning of an entwinement of interests between both the underground media operators and the main opposition grouping at that time, Tangwai. In a time where cable television was banned, its operators have seen the partnership with opposition politicians as mutually beneficial, since cable television can be used as a powerful vehicle to promote the politicians‚Äô goals and in return, the operators gain lobbyists for their business goals. The then illegal opposition grouping Tangwai only took its current opposition liberal Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) form in 1986 and even then it was done illegally. Media operators and politicians on both end of the political spectrum forged close relations during the martial law era, with whomever their vested interests lie in and this pattern persisted on to the situation today, albeit in the form of media outlets that are sympathetic to one of the two major parties. The proximity between DPP members and cable television firms suggests that, a patron client relationship was sustained between them at that time. Furthermore, it has been revealed that 20 politicians from the DPP had investments in the operation of 35 pro-DPP cable television systems in 1994. With a common goal and material support for the opposition campaign from the underground media, DPP pressed for greater liberalization of media and civil rights for the people. Yielding under popular pressure and United States, KMT lifted the 38 years of martial law imposed on Taiwan and the DPP became a legal political party in 1989, with cable television legalized with the enactment of the Cable Radio and Television Act. KMT was not a passive party in this process of negotiation for media liberalization, although it seems slow in responding to the rapidly transforming electronic media environment and that the DPP had an upper hand in the underground media environment. During the review period for the draft cable law, one of the most controversial articles added by the legislature was the ban on political party ownership of cable systems that are critical of KMT. This article could be argued as an effort made towards preserving equality and leveling the playing field for the cable television systems. However, KMT rejected the article and allowed political parties to finance cable systems. Before the enactment of the cable law, KMT has already set up Po-Hsin Multimedia in order to take a share of the cable market upon the enactment of the cable law. Recent reform efforts have seen this gap filled up as the new Radio and Television Broadcasting Law required the government, the political parties and the military to give up their electronic media shareholding by 26 December 2005. Since the legalization of cable television, KMT has lost its power over the industry contrary to what its original expectation of sustaining influence over the medium. With the rapid proliferation of print and broadcast media following liberalisation and the repeal of restrictions on transmitting and receiving cable television broadcasts, the market has taken over the state as the dominant influence over the mass media industry. A neo-liberal official of President Chen Shui-bian's Cabinet said:‚ÄùIf the public dislikes certain TV channel or radio station which they think is manipulated by a certain party or individual they detest, they simply refuse to watch it or listen to it.‚Äù The ongoing anti-monopoly dispute involving Want Want China Broadband's proposal to purchase China Network Systems seems to highlight neo-liberalism's natural bias to privilege the wealthy. If the merger is approved by the National Communications Commission (NCC), the multibillion-dollar deal would allow the Want Want conglomerate to secure 23 percent of Taiwan's cable subscribers and approximately one-third of the overall media market. The diversity of opinion in Taiwanese media is highly regarded by not only the journalist circle but also by the wider public who recognizes its importance in maintaining their society's pluralistic nature. Cable television Cable television is prevalent in Taiwan, as a result of cheap subscription rates (typically around NT$550, or US$15 a month) and the paucity of free-to-air television, which comprises about 20 channels. Programming is mostly in Mandarin and Taiwanese with a few channels are in Hakka or English. There are also programs in other foreign languages, mainly east Asian and south-east Asian languages. Miniseries, called Taiwanese drama, are popular. There is a dedicated station for Taiwan's Hakka minority as well as the arrival in 2005 of an aboriginal channel. There are around 100 channels with most stations being dedicated to a particular genre; such as game shows, news, anime, movies, sports and documentaries. Almost all programs are in the original language with traditional Chinese subtitles. The cable television system comprises around one hundred different channels, ranging from news, sport, variety, game, music, children's, foreign, movie and documentary channels. The Taiwanese government is promoting digital signal television, provided through a set-top box. The analog signal of air television was turned off on 30 June 2012. Radio There are many stations across the AM and FM spectrum broadcasting a wide variety of programming. Talk-shows, popular music and classic songs are some of the most frequently heard subjects. Exclusively Taiwanese-language stations have enjoyed a surge in popularity since the end of the martial law era and regulations restricting the use of languages other than Mandarin Chinese. * Broadcasting Corporation of China - National and regional networks * Radio Taiwan International - National broadcaster; also beams services to mainland China and the rest of the world with programmes in various languages and Chinese dialects * International Community Radio Taipei - Taiwan's only national English-language station * Public Radio System - Government-run; travel, weather, social information * Hit FM and Kiss Radio Taiwan both play popular Chinese music * UFO Radio - Second-largest station in Taiwan.

Censorship during this period was heavy with the KMT regime having near total control over the papers. It wasn‚Äôt until liberalization in 1988 that independent newspapers were allowed to open, by the end of 1988 126 newspapers operated in Taiwan. Most popular newspapers include: *Apple Daily (Pingguo Ribao) - Tabloid *China Times (Zhongguo Shibao) *Liberty Times (Ziyou Shibao) *United Daily News (Lianhe Bao) Newspapers in English: * Taipei Times (Taibei Shibao, ) * Taiwan Today (Jinri Taiwan, ) * The China Post (Yingwen Zhongguo Youbao, ) * The News Lens (GuƒÅnji√†n p√≠ngl√πn w«éng, Chinese: ÈóúÈçµË©ïË´ñÁ∂≤) Other newspapers: *Mandarin Daily News (Guoyu Ribao) - Children's newspaper, written with Zhuyin accompanying the text *Taiwan Times (Taiwan Shibao) *Commercial Times (Gongshang Ribao) *DigiTimes (Dianzi Shibao) - IT industry news *Economic Daily News (Jingji Ribao) *Youth Daily News, youth civilians and military daily newspaper Ceased publication: *Independent Evening News (Zili Wanbao) *Min Sheng Bao (Min Sheng Bao) *Taiwan Daily (Taiwan Ribao) *China Times (Night) (Zhongshi Wanbao) *Central Daily News (Zhongyang Ribao) Now publishing in electronic format: *Taiwan News (English newspaper)  Magazines and periodicals  In 1988, there were only about 3,400 magazine publishers in the country. Today, the number has been rapidly increasing to 4,827 (by August 2006). Magazines are various in different contents, including business, politics, entertainment, languages, lifestyle, technology, health, cooking, automobiles, women, education, traveling etc.  Internet  Taiwan is one of the most wired places in the world - broadband or cable modem access is relatively cheap and fast. In 2005 there were 13.8 million internet users and 2.8 million webhosts in Taiwan (for a total population of 22.9 million). A popular feature of even small towns are internet cafes (Chinese: Á∂≤Âíñ, Pinyin: w«éngkƒÅ), which are open 24-hour and sell a variety of food and drink so that the mainly teenage online gamers who inhabit them do not have to stray too far from their monitors. Taiwan websites use the .tw domain. Taiwan has some online resources available in English: * China News Agency - Government owned news agency based in Taipei * Eat News - Economic and Political Media Limited owned news agency based in Taipei Media dispute Due to the rapid change and quick development, the media in Taiwan have been in an acrimonious competition environment. In a population of 23-million market, the country has 8 twenty-four-hour news stations (compare to 3 in the US, 3 in UK, and 0 in Japan), more than 4,000 magazine publishers, and approximately 200 radio stations, and about 2,500 newspaper publishers; moreover, Taiwan also has the highest density of Satellite News Gathering (SNG) trucks, 23 million people share 82 trucks while 120 million/71 in Japan, 7 million/1 in Hong Kong, 48 million/40 in Korea, 1 billion/300 in India. However, in order to earn a higher Nielsen rating in such a competitive market, sometimes the shows tend to include sexual and violent contents. Sensational headlines are often picked up.

It is located in the quartiere of Chiaia. It stands at the foot of the Posillipo Hill and faces the Castel dell'Ovo. Some people tell the name derives from that of a shorebird called \\"mergoglino\\". There is some doubt amongst the locals as to the origin of the name \\"Mergellina\\". Other people may have the opinion that it is a corruption of \\"Mare Giallo\\" which refers to when the sea turned yellow due to floating tufa rock dust following a volcanic eruption many centuries ago. However very likely the real origin of the name is from Latin \\"mare ialinum\\", that stands for clear, transparent sea. Overview Historically, it was a small fishing village and port and was quite distinct from Naples, itself. Expansion of Naples to the west under the Spaniards in the 17th century and subsequent development under the Bourbons and then by the national Italian government between 1880 and 1915 gradually led to the incorporation of Mergellina into greater metropolitan Naples. Today it is still a fishing port but also an important secondary tourist harbor for hydrofoil traffic to the islands in the bay of Naples and to various tourist destinations along the Campanian coast. The port also serves as mooring for private pleasure craft. Mergellina was home to the poet Jacopo Sannazaro, whose verses in Italian are part of the body of literature that helped form the Italian language in the Middle Ages. His Latin works, primarily De partu Virginis, though little read today, earned him the nickname of \\"the Christian Virgil\\". A main square, one block from the harbor, faces the church of Santa Maria del Parto with his elaborate tomb. During the 1960 Summer Olympics it was used as Olympic Harbor for the Finn (at Sea Garden) and Flying Dutchman sailboats (at Posillipo). This charming location is famous for being a favourite seashore restaurants' area. At pier, fishermen for years have sold their daily catch.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson. The high school is part of a larger campus that includes an elementary and middle school. However, the high school is governed by a Board of Managers consisting of community leaders and businessmen along with a president and principal. The elementary and middle schools are governed by a different president and principal and are independent of the IHHS Board of Managers. All three campuses are the focus and mission of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The school bills itself as a small, close-knit campus with a focus on college preparatory curriculum. Background In 1870 the Sisters of Saint Joseph from Los Angeles, California arrived in Tucson and opened a school called Saint Joseph's Academy. The academy's first location was next to St. Augustine Cathedral. The Sisters of Saint Joseph moved the academy to this site, on what is now 15th Street, in 1885. They instructed both Catholics and non-Catholics. During the early period most students came from Spanish and Mexican American families. By 1931, the school had outgrown the building, and the diocese purchased another property known as Villa Carondelet in the foothills of the Rincon Mountains, east of downtown Tucson.\\"Immaculate Heart Academy and Convent\\", Arizona Women's Heritage Trail The religious institute of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was founded in Spain in 1848 by Father Joachim Masmitj√°. In 1871 nine sisters journeyed to California to teach in several schools. In 1911, five sisters from Spain and two from California were sent to start a school in Mazatl√°n, Mexico. Six years later, in 1917, the sisters were forced to leave due to the Mexican Revolution. During a stop in their journey back to California, Bishop Henry Granjon of Tucson, Arizona invited the sisters to stay and they accepted. The IHM sisters taught in various locations before moving to the site of the former Saint Joseph's Academy. History In 1930, the sisters established Immaculate Heart Academy at 35 E. 15th St. near downtown Tucson. It was a private boarding school for girls, built of stone harvested from \\"A\\" Mountain ‚Äî a peak that sits on the outskirts of the city. Seventeen SIHMs originally staffed the school which taught grades K - 12. In 1962, the high school portion - to this day, the oldest continuously running Catholic high school in Tucson - moved to its present site in what is today Oro Valley in northwest Tucson.\\"Serving Tucson students since 1930\\", Immaculate Heart School The former downtown academy on 15th Street was sold in the early 2000s and the site has been converted to loft apartments. From 1963 until 1970 the secondary school was known as Immaculate Heart High School, but the name was changed to Suffolk Hills Catholic High School in 1971, and operated under that name until 1990. In 1990, the name was changed back to its original name of Immaculate Heart High School. In 1973, the school went co-ed. In 1987, the grade school moved to the northwest side of town, soon to be followed by the building of the middle school in 1994. All three campuses, within walking distance of each other, are now known collectively as Immaculate Heart Schools. In 1988 the high school earned accreditation from North Central Association of Colleges and Schools as well as the Western Catholic Educational Association. In 1990, the name was changed back to its original name of Immaculate Heart High School, a coeducational school. It is accredited as a college preparatory high school and is a member of the National Catholic Educational Association, Washington, D.C. The school mascot is a Knight. In late 2005, Immaculate Heart made known that it was in the process of developing a strategic plan to try to revive the high school campus. The sisters were successful in raising money for the school through various fundraising and capital improvement campaigns. A new school gymnasium was dedicated in November 2006. In 2007, the high school initiated a strategic plan to increase enrollment to 250 in three to five years (enrollment in August, 2007 was 64). The high school initiated a 3-5 year capital campaign, which included an increase in staffing to help increase enrollment, along with investing in cutting edge curriculum including Astrobiology and Virtual High School Netcourse, which open over 200 elective courses to IHHS students. In 2005, the Academic Decathlon team won the 1A Arizona State Championship. The team also won state championships in 2007 and 2008. The Virgin Mary Campus The neighborhood surrounding the school's campuses is known as Suffolk Hills, named for the countess of Suffolk, who was a frequent visitor to Tucson from England many decades ago. It is her estate the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart purchased for use as an elementary school when the grade school moved out of Tucson. The caretaker's building became the school office. Stables were converted to classrooms. The former multi-car garage now houses sixth-grade classes. The house itself is still home to eight sisters. Structure In July 2006, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary approved a new model of management. This model is structured with a Board of Managers, a President and a Principal, to provide a business and strategic oversight. With the approval of this management structure, the president would focus on development, recruitment, marketing and strategic planning. The president also reports directly to the Board of Managers, and sits on the executive committee of the board along with several other committees including the Buildings and Grounds and Recruitment.

Footwork is a martial arts and combat sports term for the general usage of the legs and feet in stand-up fighting. Footwork involves keeping balance, closing or furthering the distance, controlling spatial positioning, and/or creating additional momentum for strikes. Basic incarnations of footwork =Boxing footwork= The characteristic footwork employed by most of the world's major boxing and kickboxing styles, such as Western boxing and Muay Thai, has changed little over the centuries, and has remained largely invariable between radically different cultures. The boxer relies on 'push stepping'. In which the leading leg advances first, then the rear, with the feet coming to rest in the exact relative position. Rear movement is a reversal of this step, and lateral movement involves push stepping in the same fashion, with the foot closest to the desired direction stepping laterally, followed by the opposite foot, which is used to move the body. For the pugilist, footwork is to be deft and simplistic, allowing the fighter to move in and out of striking range as quickly as possible. Footwork is key to generating sufficient power in the basic strikes shared between the major boxing styles. During the jab, the lead foot can move forward to close distance or remain stationary. During the cross, the rear foot pivots inward to launch the rear shoulder forward, allowing the cross a good deal of its strength. During the left hook, the lead foot pivots in an inward manner to transfer body weight. The right hook's pivot is identical to the cross (assuming the boxer is orthodox). The lead uppercut, like the jab does not use any pivotal motion, the power comes from the transfer of body weight to the lead foot. The rear uppercut employs the same inward pivot as the cross. To maintain balance, both feet can step, pivot or slide as appropriate. The jab may be thrown while moving forward or backward; for the other punches it is advisable not to throw while in motion. =Kickboxing footwork= Kickboxing employs the same basic footwork pattern as the styles that focus only on the upper body, with the one key difference lying in the defense and positioning for lower body strikes. The kick-boxer will often shift his weight backward onto his rear leg to allow his leading leg to react more quickly to an incoming blow as in a 'shield,'(right) a defense used against a round kick, or to execute swift kicking maneuvers such as foot jabs and the Muay Thai teep or stop kick. Radical pivoting and sudden lead changes also accommodate the wider, more powerful movement of the knees and legs. In styles that allow for the clinch, the debased balance forces movement to be more squared, and footwork to be replaced by powerful thrusting or frenetic skipping movements with the sole purpose of keeping on one's feet. In Thailand, Muay Thai fighters will often provoke attack by tapping their lead foot or by letting it rest in the air, both considered grievous insults within that nation. =Linear footwork= Linear movement is common to a great deal of the martial arts world, and is predominant in arts of Japanese and Korean influence such as many forms of Karate and Tae-Kwon-Do, as well as some grappling arts such as Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Sambo and Shooto, and few forms of Chinese martial arts, such as Wing Chun and Bruce Lee's later incarnation, Jun Fan Gung Fu. Perhaps the most stark example of linear footwork, however, is that used in European fencing, especially within the modern sport aspect. Dominated by the philosophy that the fastest and most economical way to an opponent is a straight line, arts that use linear movement as their focus adopt mostly rigid stances and behaviors, and focus primarily on the speed of advance and retreat to overcome an adversary. The striking arts of Japan and Korea utilize linear form quickly to overwhelm opponents with powerful, focused blows, whereas the Chinese arts primarily respect linear movement as a method of staying in reference to the opponent's centerline, and for its necessary use in trapping, or close-range grappling exchanges (See Chin Na). Linear footwork's direct, sharp movements are natural for most grappling systems, which aim quickly to take an opponent to the floor with as little movement or adjustment as necessary. \\"Shooting,\\" or rushing for the legs in order to execute a takedown, is a universal action that is an example of linear footwork's application. =Triangular footwork= This unique and highly versatile footwork pattern is popular within the arts that populate many of the nations that once comprised the Majapahit Empire, including those of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines Principally Kali-Arnis-Escrima (see Escrima), Silat, Kuntao, and Panantukan. Diagonal or triangular footwork involves moving in triangular fashion as opposed to the direct forward or lateral movement present in boxing and other styles such as Karate or Tae-Kwon-Do.. For example, a user of triangular footwork will choose to advance or retreat at a diagonal to one's opponent, as to potentially set oneself into a superior position or attack or defense, and to disorient opponents that may not be familiar with this type of unconventional movement. Users of triangular footwork appear as if zigzagging along the points of many diamonds in randomized directions. The emphasis on evasion over blocking, as well as efficient counterattacking, is likely influenced by the significance of weapons, especially edged ones, in Kali- Arnis-Escrima and silat. Because the danger of exchanging weapon strikes is much higher risk than with empty hands, it is common practice to use triangular footwork to achieve a superior position to one's opponent to both avoid an attack as well as launching a counterattack before the opponent has a chance to recover. There are three types of triangular movement: The male triangle pattern with involves retreating in a triangular pattern that is facing away from the practitioner, the female triangle pattern that has the practitioner advancing along an inverse triangle facing opposite of the fighter, and the lateral triangle, which involves moving in a triangular pattern to the right, and left of the practitioner. Movement in a linear fashion is achieved, principally, by a \\"step and slide.\\" The fighter will first move to the desired 'point' on the triangular matrix, then swiftly slide one's rear leg to meet his leading foot. From this position, the practitioner either rests one's foot to facilitate an attack or defense, or shoot his foot out to another point to complete another step and slide motion. Advanced users of triangular footwork literally \\"bounce\\" their rear feet off the ankle or heel area of their leading foot to jut out to another point as swiftly as possible, allowing for change of direction at incredible speed. The majority of the arts that utilize triangular footwork can effectively be practiced in either right or left leads interchangeably, so they are naturally suited for this manner of movement. Panantukan, Filipino boxing, is an exception to the standard step and slide, as it features a hybrid footwork pattern that combines triangular movement with a boxing stance, and boxing's close attention to body mechanics. A Panantukan fighter will use his unique footwork to attempt to zone his opponent to achieve the perfect striking position. =Circular footwork= Circular movement patterns are an integral part of many forms of traditional Chinese martial arts, such as Baguazhang, Xingyiquan and Taijiquan, due principally to the strong influence of Tao philosophy. Circular footwork is also the basic method of movement in Enshin karate and derivative styles. Circular footwork functions in a way similar to triangular footwork, in that the martial artist advances towards his opponent at an angle in order to occupy the opponent's \\"blind spot.\\" From here, the practitioner can strike more effectively while limiting his opponent's options for attack. Circular footwork is often considered more difficult to master than other types of footwork. =Unconventional footwork= Many styles of martial arts the world over contain footwork patterns that defy categorization. Such arts many Chinese Kung Fu styles that contain proliferant footwork methods that involve deep crouching, and closely mimic the movements and behaviors of animals, such as the tiger (harimau), monkey, or snake. The unique methods present within these arts make them philosophies unto themselves. Brazilian martial art Capoeira uses footwork much like a dance to create offensive and defensive opportunities. Capoeirista use a side-to-side movement pattern known as ginga from which all other techniques are initiated. An unconventional \\"dancing\\" style of footwork was popularized by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali in the 1960s. He moved side to side, and forward and back, while bouncing on the balls of his feet and dancing around his opponents. This allowed him to quickly move to wherever he wanted in the ring. He also occasionally shuffled his feet back and forth quickly, confusing his opponents before landing a blow, a move called the Ali shuffle. His unconventional footwork was referred to as the \\"dancing legs\\" at the time. The martial artist and actor Bruce Lee was influenced by Ali's footwork, which he studied and incorporated into his own Jeet Kune Do style of mixed martial arts. Ali's footwork also inspired a brief dance craze in Europe during 1966, mimicking Ali's footwork to a swinging up-tempo beat. =Footwork and weaponry= The presence of weapons can vastly influence how a fighter moves, in order to correctly accommodate the specific weapon in hand. Most forms of swordsmanship and stickfighting advocate that the lead foot be matched with the main hand, or hand that is currently clutching the weapon, as to allow the maximum possible reach to be achieved. This is also true for the use of knives and daggers, polearms, and flexible weapons. When using a weapon, reach is paramount to all other positioning options, thus the lead-to-lead rule is almost universally present, with few exceptions. Also, you generally want to shield your body with your weapon and not vice versa.

The capital of the municipality is San Antoni√±o, where the parish of Perdecanai and the Consistorial House are located. Location Located in north-western Pontevedra, also known as Ineslandia, and belonging to the region of the same name, Barro covers 37.9 square kilometers. It is bordered to the south by the towns of Poio and Pontevedra, to the east by Mora√±a, to the north by Portas and to the west by Meis. Parishes The municipality is composed of 6 parishes: * Portela (San Mamede) * Perdecanai (Santa Mar√≠a) * Agudelo (San Mart√≠n) * Curro (Santa Mar√≠a) * Barro (San Breixo) * Vali√±as (San Andr√©s)  History  The parishes that today form the municipality of Barro used to belong to the jurisdiction of Pe√±aflor, in the province of Santiago during the Antiguo R√©gimen (Old Regime). Today's Barro formed part of one of the first constitutional city councils, the one of Trasumia, belonging to the judicial party of Caldas de Reyes. In 1822, when Galicia was divided into four provinces, Caldas de Reyes increased in municipalities; however Ferdinand VII of Spain overruled the changes in 1823 and effectively returned the organization of the Old Regime. In 1835 new proposals for the municipal arrangement were made, where Caldas de Reyes would have had six city councils. One of them would have been Barro with seven parishes and 2 459 inhabitants. Once the Provincial Council of Pontevedra was constituted in 1836 the final agreement increased the number of town halls, leaving Barro with the six parishes it still has. The new municipality of Barro appears in documentation of the judicial party of Caldas de Reyes in 1836 as having 2 407 inhabitants. The city council was located in Porr√°ns or in Coruto throughout the nineteenth century, but around 1900 it moved to San Antoni√±o. It is assumed that the capital's location moved from one place to another depending on the number of inhabitants or on the place of residence of the municipal councilors. Since the mid-nineteenth century until the 1980s the population and business center of Barro was not strictly in any of the six parishes, but in the place of Porr√°ns, due to its strategic position and commercial crossroads between Santiago de Compostela, Pontevedra and Mora√±a. One of the most important person in Barro is Ines.

It is known for its famous white wine, Albari√±o. Cambados Interior of the church of St Benito. Ruins of the church of St Mari√±a Dozo. Convent of San Francisco in Cambados.  Culture  Fishing is a major industry in this coastal area of Galicia (called Rias baixas). In Cambados, fish and seafood sellers sell at what is called La Plaza, which is a great and hallowed installation that is very busy every morning (except for Sundays), as fish is usually part of the daily diet. La r√≠a de Arousa, the body of water that surrounds this area, is rich in many types of seafood, as well. In Cambados, seafood is mostly collected in \\"O Serrido\\" or \\"A Seca\\", which is an area of water surrounding the San Tome Tower (see below) emptying out almost completely when the tide is low, leaving the perfect area for seafood collectors. Large groups of them, (mostly women, with a few exceptions once in a while) go when the tide is low with their buckets and tools to dig up the sand and collect seafood (clams, cockles, etc.). The culture in Cambados, as well as most coastal villages of Galicia, very much revolves around seafood. It is always eaten at Christmastime, on holidays, and (especially) at weddings. Every Saturday and Wednesday morning there is a market along the maritime walk, selling generally cheap clothing, accessories, shoes, perfumes, and household items. It is very popular because of its prices and walking through the market the sellers yell out prices and persuasions. Most holidays call for fiestas, in which there are performances and rides, usually occurring during summertime. The largest and most famous of these fiestas is the Festa do Albari√±o, that usually lasts about a week towards the end of July or beginning of August. Tents are set up along the Calzada selling high quality Albari√±o wine and seafood, and most people walk around with a wine glass hanging with a thread from their neck. Performances during the Albari√±o are usually special: whilst other fiesta performances consist of unknown orchestras, the Albari√±o usually brings about more famous performers. For example, Alejandro Sanz has performed during these fiestas.  Albari√±o  Cambados is famous for its Albari√±o white wine. The area is generally moist, cool and windy, contributing to the grape‚Äôs thickness and the wine‚Äôs strong aroma. It has only been within this last decade that Albari√±o has become world-renowned and has been grown outside of Galicia. This wine has been nicknamed ‚Äúthe wine of the sea‚Äù, because of its coastal vineyards and its compatibility with seafood (caused by its acidity).  Political History  The first mayor of Cambados during the Second Republic of Spain was Juan Vidal Fraga (1931‚Äì1936). The republic reached Cambados without the existence of a Republican party in the area. Fraga‚Äôs family had controlled the political life in Cambados during the reform. In February 1936, Jos√© Manuel Silva became the new governor. The beginning of the 20th century coincides with Spain‚Äôs restoration period, which is politically influenced by C√°novas del Castillo. This consists in the alternation of power between two parties‚Äîthe Conservative and Liberal (leaving out, for now, the Obreira and Republican parties). This contributed with major political change, leaning towards a more local system rather than being associated with Spain‚Äôs higher power. The first democratic elections were in 1979. Climate This climate can be classified as hot and oceanic humid. Temperatures are moderate and rainfall is abundant, 1,500 millimeters on average. In the winter maximum temperatures hover around 14 ¬∞C and minimum around ‚àí2 ¬∞C, but rarely drop below 0 ¬∞C. In the spring and fall the minimum is around 6 ¬∞C and maximum around 23 ¬∞C. Storms and heavy rains are common around this time of the year.

It is generally agreed that his writing is more important for its historical value than its literary merit.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 22. Early life in England Henry Savery was born in Somerset, England into the family of a well to do banker.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 6. Little else is known of his early years. He married Eliza Elliott Oliver, daughter of a London business man, and their only son was born in 1816. His attempts to earn a living were unsuccessful, a sugar-refining business being declared bankrupt in 1819 and proprietorship of the newspaper The Bristol Observer lasting only a little over two years.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 7. His return to sugar refining ended in catastrophe. Probably because he could not admit having overextended the firm's commitments to his partner, he began trading in forged bills of credit which eventually amounted to over ¬£30,000.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 8. His partner called the authorities when he absconded with ¬£1500. He was arrested on 9 December, having jumped from the boat that was to take him to America. While in prison his behaviour was so erratic that his trial had to be postponed. On 2 April 1825 he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to hang on the 22nd of the same month.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 9. Through influential friends this was commuted to transportation, only a day before his execution was due. Sometime in August he departed England for the last time on the ship Medway with 171 other convicts. Transported to Van Diemens Land Arriving in Hobart, Van Diemen's Land at the end of 1825, Savery was retained in government service and worked for the Colonial Treasurer, an appointment which raised a few eyebrows.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 12. In 1828 his wife and son came to the colony and arguments between them culminated in his attempted suicide.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 15. There had been rumours about Eliza's conduct with the colony's Attorney General, her chaperone, during the journey from England. She may have also been angered that Savery's letters to her had exaggerated his position in the colony. Soon after, he was imprisoned for debt and Eliza took their son back England within three months. This was the last they were to see of each other. In prison he wrote a series of sketches of activities and personages in the colony.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 16. These were published in the Colonial Times and, after settling a libel suit, collected in the book The Hermit of Van Diemen's Land (1829). This occurred under the pseudonym 'Simon Stukeley' as a convict could be sent to the far worse Macquarie Harbour for being published. Indeed, it is only through a note in his publisher's (one Henry Melville) own copy of the book that we know of Savery's authorship at all. He wrote his novel during his assignment to the household of Major Hugh Macintosh, one of the two founders of Cascade Brewery. He was given permission to reside at Major Macintosh's Lawn Farm on the banks of the Derwent River, about 6 kilometers down stream from New Norfolk, on the condition that he not carry on his own business. Macintosh and Savery appeared to have established a friendship prior to his assignment and Savery was soon managing Lawn Farm for Macintosh, whilst also being given time to write Quintus Servinton.Heroes and Villains by Greg Jefferys 2013 After Macintosh's death in December 1834 Savery remained at Lawn Farm as manager for at least another four years. Quintus Servinton: A Tale founded upon Incidents of Real Occurrence was published anonymously in 1831 to reasonably good reviews from the colonial press.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 17. Savery's authorship became a public secret and was even mentioned in a reference for his ticket of leave which was granted in 1832. Unfortunately his relative freedom was quickly revoked because of his writing, in this case for the paper The Tasmanian.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 18. Then, farcically, the suspension was suspended when it turned out to be a pretext for tarring the reputation of Governor Arthur. Savery's illegal authorship was thereafter quietly ignored. His final years are murky, though it is known that he gained a provisional pardon.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 19. He fell into debt again and possibly alcoholism. By 1839 he was refused a convict servant. Towards the end of 1840 he was caught at his old tricks and charged with forging bills.Quintus Servinton. Ed. Cecil Hadgraft (1830; Jacaranda, 1962), p. 20. Brought before the magistrate who had chaperoned his wife, he was again sentenced to transportation. He was imprisoned at Port Arthur where, early in 1842, he died possibly after slitting his own throat. He was buried on the Isle of the Dead just off the coast of the prison. As noted above, posterity has not been altogether kind to his attempts at self-invention.

Etymology The name Ogrobe is well documented and the following passage in Latin was written about the name of Ograbe: \\"et ecclesiam Sancti Uincentii in insula Ocobre dextris cum suis.\\" (899, St. Vincent of O Grove). Its original form is Ogrobe, having suffered in more recent times as a result of a completely Spanish etymological process.

It is an hour by plane from Lima, in the high jungle plateau to the east of what is known as the selva baja (low jungle). Although Moyobamba is the capital of the region, Tarapoto is the region's largest city and is linked to the Upper Amazon and the historic city of Yurimaguas by a relatively well-maintained transandean highway, paved in 2008‚Äì9. Tarapoto is approximately above sea level on the high jungle plateau, also called the cloud forest. (in Spanish) It was founded in 1782 by Baltazar Mart√≠nez Jim√©nez de Compagnon. According to the 2017 census Tarapoto has a population of 180,073 within the city limits, and over 130,000 inhabitants including the outlying Morales and Banda de Shilcayo districts. Tarapoto is often used by tourists and local visitors as a base for excursions into the vast Amazon Rainforest. The region's main activities are tourism, commerce, agriculture, and an illicit \\"shadow economy\\" that includes production of coca leaves, extraction of lumber, and trading in land concessions. Tarapoto is home to the Universidad Nacional de San Mart√≠n, an important center of higher education serving the professional and technical needs of a region of high biodiversity. With its active nightlife, Tarapoto offers a wide variety of hotels and restaurants in and around the city. Moreover, the area's beautiful landscapes, waterfalls and lagoons form a tempting location for adventure tourism, such as river rafting and hiking in the tropical Andes, and attract numerous visitors to the \\"City of Palms\\".  History  A ceremony taking place in the central square of Tarapoto Tarapoto was founded on August 20, 1782 by the Spanish bishop Baltazar Jaime Mart√≠nez de Compagnon y Bujanda. Its beginnings date back to the explorations of the Pocras and Chancas (old cultures of the Ayacucho region) who, when being conquered by the Inca Empire, headed a revolution led by the commander Ancohallo; a revolt that, when defeated, forced their tribal members to escape from terrible Inca vengeance. Eventually settling down in the valleys of the Mayo and Cumbaza rivers, in what is now the Department of San Mart√≠n, they possibly formed the town of Lamas, before establishing a satellite in the valley of the rivers Cumbaza and Shilcayo, having as a central nucleus the Suchiche Lagoon (dried up in the colony). In this lagoon grew abundant Taraputus palms, a name that the Spanish bishop would later use when founding the city in this area of hunters and fishermen. Founded September 14, 1906, Tarapoto is the main tourist and commercial hub of this part of northeastern Peru.

It has the distinction of being the smallest municipality in Galicia and one of the smallest in Spain with an area of 2.4 km2.  Ancient and medieval history  It is known through archaeological remains that the site now occupied by the town was inhabited from prehistoric times, which establishes the existence of a fort in the Coto Cividade as well as in Roman times, as in Pious neighboring parish are remains of Roman amphorae, various ceramic and bronze coins confirming the occupation. However, the finding of greater magnitude and Roman is the best proof that Mondariz-Balneario was Romanized, are remains of a Roman road near the stands, on or river Tea, Cernadela bridge, also of Roman origin. Tradition has it that in 1282 and in the chapel of San Pedro which is situated in this county, took place the marriage of King Diniz of Portugal to the Princess Isabella of Aragon, daughter of Peter III and later became known as Isabel of Portugal.  Contemporary history  In the new division of Pontevedra municipalities, in accordance with Royal Decree of 23 June 1835, it was included in the parish of Mondariz as a mere territory, and as reflected in his writings Florida Blanca, it was under the jurisdiction of Sobrosa, being dependent of Don Juan Lago, the Marquis de Valladares and the Marquis de Sobrosa. In 1904 the parish becomes Troncoso, a newly created parish whose territories were dispersed from the parish of Santa Eulalia de Mondariz dependent of Mondariz parish. In 1924, after the change of name to the parish of Our Lady of Lourdes it becomes an independent municipality on November 30 with the current name Mondariz-Balneario. Balneario is the Spanish word for spa resort, referring the host-medical establishment that had provided the necessary economic strength to support its emancipation from Mondariz. Thus, the history of Mondariz-Balneario is closely related to Don Sabino Peinador Enrique Vela, who made the aforementioned neighborhood Troncoso renowned spa, thanks to which appeared the town. Since April 17, 1925 the town of Mondariz- Balneario holds the title of \\"Very hospitable villa\\" granted by King Alfonso XIII and General Primo de Rivera in thanks to good treatment received from the neighbors in their frequent visits to the Grand Hotel. The Grand Hotel, that opened in 1898 and hosted very important guests in the early twentieth century, started its decline after the spanish civil war. In 1973 a devastating fire destroyed the Grand Hotel and left the building in ruins until 2005, when it was rebuilt to house private apartments. In the meantime, a new hotel and spa was built in the adjacent buildings, and nowadays Mondariz-Balneario remains as one of the most important spa resorts in Galicia.

Family Cronin was married to another academic, the late dental epidemiologist Aubrey Sheiham, professor of dental public health at University College London. Her first cousin is Professor Sir Michael Marmot, an epidemiologist. Reception Cronin's strong rationalistic views brought her prominence in a number of areas, such as sexual selection, Darwinism, the relative abilities of males and females, and gay rights. These are discussed in turn below. =Altruism and sexual selection= The evolutionary zoologist Mark Ridley, reviewing The Ant and the Peacock in the New York Times, writes that it is a \\"fine book\\" in which Cronin uses our modern understanding of altruism (the ant) and \\"dangerously gaudy sexual ornamentation\\" (the peacock). Ridley notes that there are two reasons for sex differences like the peacock's train, and that Cronin explains them through the debate of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin proposed female choice: female aesthetics drive male displays. Wallace both \\"ignored Darwin's problem\\" (ornamentation) and \\"denied Darwin's solution\\" (female choice rather than natural selection). Instead, Ridley observes, Cronin explains that Wallace preferred the explanation that peacock's tails \\"crop up almost automatically\\"; he believed that female choice was both unnecessary and impossible. Ridley finds Cronin \\"quite amusing as she reviews the 'misogynistic opinion' of the critics of female choice\\", citing Cronin's example of the universally unpleasant 19th century anti-Darwinian St. George Mivart, \\"such is the instability of a vicious feminine caprice, that no constancy of coloration could be produced by its selective action.\\" But curiously (notes Ridley), Darwin and Wallace swapped roles in Cronin's problem of the ant, where Darwin argued for natural selection, while Cronin quotes Wallace arguing that for human \\"intellectual and moral faculties\\", \\"we can only find an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit.\\"Wallace, Alfred Russel (1889). Darwinism. Chapter 15. p. 478 In Ridley's opinion, \\"The subtlest and most original insights in \\"The Ant and the Peacock\\" concern differences between Darwin's ideas and modern ideas.\\" Ridley finds that Cronin \\"moves easily between the Victorians and ourselves\\", not entirely avoiding the danger of anachronism, \\"the historian's mortal sin\\", that this movement creates. He suspects that the book will therefore \\"appeal more to philosophically minded readers than to historians,\\" but grants that \\"luckily\\" evolution is \\"one of the more philosophical of scientific ideas\\", and Wallace and Darwin can survive being treated as our contemporaries. The review of The Ant and the Peacock in Biology and Philosophy comments that Cronin's book is \\"Beautifully written, [with] good strong examples, a nice sense of history, flashes of humour, plain forthright conclusions.\\" Nils K. Oeijord, in his book Why Gould was Wrong, notes that Stephen Jay Gould \\"was really a strange thinker.\\" Oeijord continues, \\"Example: Many have wondered at Gould's verbally violent review of The Ant and the Peacock (1991) by Helena Cronin. He attacked Cronin for explaining human altruism as natural! He accused Cronin of errors, omissions, tricks, falsities, rhetorical flourishes, etc. But all these things are typically Gould's ways of writing books!\\" Oeijord notes that Cronin was just presenting \\"the new consensus in evolutionary biology‚Äîthe gene- selectionist approach\\" to which Gould simply had to fight back; but \\"two scientific giants\\", John Maynard Smith and Daniel Dennett defended Cronin against Gould's charges. =Darwinism= The English evolutionary anthropologist Camilla Power, in A reply to Helena Cronin, described Cronin as \\"authoress of 'The Ant and the Peacock' [who] was pontificating .. on how Darwinian theory should inform Blairite social policy...this is a Darwinian's response\\". Power sets out to \\"nail a few myths\\". She attacks Cronin's claim that women are disposed to wanting a single mate, noting that monogamy is rarer than biologists thought: females resist male efforts to control them; human females too seek \\"extra-pair copulations (EPCs) in the jargon of evolutionary ecology\\", while among indigenous peoples in the Amazon, females seek \\"backup fathers for each offspring\\". Power observes that men do not necessarily run around, but guard existing mates to limit female choice, contrary to Cronin's view; and among the Aka in the Central African rainforest, men often share in childcare. \\"Human male strategies are quasi- female by primate standards.\\" Power then attacks Cronin's view of the lone mother, showing that grandmothers assist their daughters' offspring. Power is critical of Cronin's \\"mysterious statement about women\\" that \\"'They are the species as it existed before sexual selection drove men apart'\\", observing that human nature evolved in \\"small-scale, face-to-face societies where no one was richer or poorer.\\" =Male qualities= Edge, in its \\"Annual Question\\" in 2008, hosted Cronin in a piece entitled More dumbbells but more Nobels: Why men are at the top: :\\"I used to think that these patterns of sex differences resulted mainly from average differences between men and women in innate talents, tastes and temperaments. After all, in talents men are on average more mathematical, more technically minded, women more verbal; in tastes, men are more interested in things, women in people; in temperaments, men are more competitive, risk-taking, single-minded, status-conscious, women far less so. But I have now changed my mind. It is not a matter of averages, but of extremes. Females are much of a muchness, clustering round the mean. But, among males, the variance‚Äîthe difference between the most and the least, the best and the worst‚Äîcan be vast. So males are almost bound to be over- represented both at the bottom and at the top. I think of this as 'more dumbbells but more Nobels'.\\"Cronin, Helena.

In her youth, she was a Zionist leader in Europe, a partisan, and a participant in the ghetto uprisings in Poland and Lithuania. Grossman was born in Bia≈Çystok, Poland. As a teenager she joined the HaShomer HaTzair Socialist-Zionist youth movement. As a leader of the movement in Poland, she was sent to the town of Brze≈õƒá Litewski to organize the movement's activities there and in the surrounding region. When World War II erupted, she moved to Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where she was active in the emergency underground leadership of HaShomer HaTzair. Upon the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, she returned to Bia≈Çystok, where she helped organize the underground movement in the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto. She served as a courier between that ghetto and those of Wilno, Lublin, Warsaw and others. Using forged papers, she managed to pass as a Polish woman named Halina Woranowicz. Her Polish identity enabled her to assist the underground movements in numerous towns and ghettoes, as well as the emerging partisan units being formed in the nearby forests of Poland and Lithuania. Aided by Otto Busse she also purchased arms and helped smuggle them into the ghettoes. In 1943, she took part in the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto Uprising, and helped to establish an underground unit of anti-Nazi Germans. After the war, she served on the Central Committee of the Jews of Poland, and was awarded Poland's highest medal for heroism. She emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1948 and joined Kibbutz Evron in the Western Galilee. She also served in various capacities in the Mapam Party. From 1950 to 1951 she was the head of Ga'aton Regional Council. From 1969 to 1988 (aside from a break between 1981 and 1984), Grossman was a member of Knesset for Mapam and the Alignment (an alliance which Mapam was part of). As a parliamentarian, she focused on social issues and the status of women. Among the laws she helped pass were the right to abortions, laws relating to at-risk youth, and the law against beating children. In 1993, Grossman was invited to light one of twelve torches traditionally kindled in the national ceremony marking Yom Ha'atzma'ut (Israel's Independence Day). Later, at a party for the torch lighters, she slipped down a flight of stairs and fell into a coma, which lasted three years, until her death in 1996.

A Ca√±iza is part of the comarca of A Paradanta. This category of village municipality, known for its excellent tourism and the strong momentum that is experiencing the industrial and business sector. The exquisite and rich local cuisine, from meat products with ham as a champion and holding important events, such as the ancient pilgrimages A Franqueira, declared by the Autonomous Community of Galicia Tourist Interest Party, or the known Ham Fair, are some of the tourist attractions . This mid-mountain location and interior provides the opportunity to see a marked diversity caused by the uneven landscape of mountains and valleys and to know its artistic heritage, the customs of the people and enjoy the many popular events that take place throughout the year. The tourist offer is complete with services designed to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants and, at the same time, to meet the needs and demands of travelers who daily visit to Ca√±iza .  History  Despite being the newest of the parishes which constitute the Municipal, if we consider its founding year, A Ca√±iza is today the most important of the nine that make up the town, to reside in it the capital of the municipality, to focus on the same most of the administrative services and for being home to the most population despite being the smallest in size . However, as already noted, the history of this place goes back nearly 200 years ago. The first inhabitants of this parish were from nearby, especially Valeixe . Began to populate the area, specifically the area known today as A Calzada, to serve better and more closely the cultivation of their lands . For the first inhabitants would follow others because were increasingly neighbors who wanted to stay close to their property and their fields and they began to build their own rooms, which followed best buildings. The name \\" Ca√±izas \\" that was given to the parish, which was faithfully explains their origin. The area began to fill with a few booths or huts made of woven tree branches and covered with straw to which the people of the country were called Ca√±izas and hurdles, so that the farmers could shelter from the rain . They were also known then the hurdles with the name of granaries . Later also would begin construction of the so-called Royal Road of the cities of Tuy and Vigo for Castile, a work that would give the final impetus to this parish . The choice of route for these lands had much to do with good soil conditions. In this case Valeixe was relegated for having a more complicated orographic structure design of the roadway. For this voyage were raising numerous buildings . It was known as Main Street and also had a Coaching Inn for horse trough in the place we now know as Source of the Two Pipes. At first, the place of A Ca√±iza belonged to the parish of St ¬™. Valeixe Cristina, who Valeixe City Council, as tends to be confused even today . But on 9 July 1790, the Bishop of Tuy, Fern√°ndez Angulo D.Domingo become the neighborhood \\" the Canizas \\" in Santa Cristina annexed so repeatedly request the locals of this neighborhood because, among other reasons, to the great distance that had to travel daily to the parish church . The church was located in Valeixe, or what is the same at 9 kilometers by a bad and \\" rocky \\" road. Shortly thereafter begin to build a chapel on the ground now occupied by the Plaza Mayor of the town, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus and St ¬™. Teresa . The July 28, 1790, would mark the first baptism and first marriage on September 5, also of the same year . But funerals are still held in Valeixe until full breakup occurred . The population of the town grew increasingly more and wishing their neighbors separated entirely from the matrix and ask autonomy before the ordinary ecclesiastical parish of Tuy, did so in a contested trial, winning in a close case. They got the judgment on 25 February 1815. Due to political changes so significant that the country was living, A Ca√±iza had several cures treasurers and would have to wait until April or May 1844 to have its first abbot pastor named Dan.

It is one of the five municipalities with Bueu, Cangas do Morrazo, Marin and Vilaboa that forms the peninsula of O Morrazo. This peninsula separates the Ria of Vigo from the Ria of Pontevedra. The coast of Moa√±a has several beaches and the area combines tourism with traditional seafood production. The surrounding sea contains sea farms where mussels, oysters and other species are cultivated and it is an idyllic place for practicing sea sports activities. The Strait of Rande, where the Rande Bridge now connects Moa√±a with the municipality of Redondela, was the scene of the Battle of Vigo Bay (or Battle of Rande). Moa√±a has developed a significant cultural life with the highlights of this being the Interceltic Festival of Morrazo, the Week of Carnival and numerous other local feasts. Social movements were relevant in Moa√±a in the first half of the 20th century where the presence of the CNT (National Confederation of Labour) was significant. In fact, the current local pub/bar for retired people was the head office of this syndicate in Moa√±a during the Second Spanish Republic. History The first reports of human occupation of these lands belong to the Acheulean period (75,000 BC). In the parishes of Domaio, O Carme, Meira and Tiran are also found flint tools and the remains of settlements dating from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages. Elements of the Beaker culture outside funeral environments were documented for the first time in Galicia in the area of A Fontela (Domaio). Tools and weapons of copper and bronze were found in Meira, Domaio and Tiran, where some relevant petroglyphs can be visited. The Castro culture is widely represented in the municipality with strong indications of romanization. In the Middle Ages, Moa√±a was under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Iria Flavia and Santiago de Compostela. In the 7th century Norman attacks caused a loss of population throughout the Morrazo, but from the 12th century, took place a new resurgence of the population, after Archbishop Diego Gelm√≠rez established a plan to defend the coast. From these dates are the churches of San Martino and San Xo√°n of Tiran. From the 14th century, families like the Meira, the Valadares or Soutomaior took control of the town. Noteworthy is the episode of the destruction of Meira Tower during the Irmandi√±o Wars (1467‚Äì1469). The introduction of maize in the 17th century, changed local economy. Then 90% of arable land is utilized for the cultivation of this plant. As consequence, there is a raising of water mills along the rivers in the district. Fishing has been a key activity in the local economy during all that time. The arrival of entrepreneurs from Catalonia in the 17th century established the fish canning industry, generating a population and economic growth quite remarkable. In 1702 comes the Battle of Rande where British and Netherland forces take and plunder Domaio, Meira and Tiran. One hundred years later (1809) battles are fought in this land against the French invaders. Climate Moa√±a has a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are not extreme, having an annual average of 15 ¬∞C. Precipitation ranges between 1300 and 1500 mm per year. Economy Traditional shipyard The economy of Moa√±a has always been related to the sea. This relationship covers all the economic sectors. The activities of the primary sector complement industrial and services industries, which are also based on the maritime activities. The primary sector (mainly fishing) contains 24.4% of the working population (2006 data). 39% of the working population work within the secondary sector. This sector's main activities are building, shipyard activities and the canning of seafood. The services sector has 37% of the working population with shopping and tourism being the main activities. Tourism amenities within the area include a golf camp and three pleasure harbors. Hydrology = Beaches= The whole south limit of Moa√±a is coast. There are a series of rocky cliffs and beaches from the strait of Rande to the municipality of Cangas. Cliffs are short of height and there are some small beaches at their bottom. Large beaches are formed in the inlets. The most popular are: A Borna Beach. *A Xunqueira Beach, located in the city centre.

Media coverage In July 2007, the firm gained some unlooked-for publicity when its discussions with Mr Justice Peter Smith concerning the possibility that the judge might take up employment with Addleshaws became the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal. The judge was discontented at the breakdown of the employment negotiations but nonetheless refused to recuse himself from hearing a case in which an individual partner of the firm was engaged in the capacity of trustee. The Court of Appeal ruled that the judge could not hear the case.The High Court judge who may be in for much more than a severe wigging The Times, Frances Gibb, 18 July 2007 The judge subsequently received a formal reprimand from the Lord Chief Justice.[citation needed] 'COMPUTER FORENSICS and DISCLOSURE OF E-MAILS' SHAW V CHESHIRE CONSTABULARY [2015]EWHC 3021 Admin Mr Shaw believed that Philip Goodstone, then a corporate partner with Addleshaws had knowingly withheld important information, about fraudulent activity committed against him by Mr Goodstone, from the Court. A search of Mr Goodstone's e-mail records sent and received over a few days was likely to reveal whether that had been true. Following a Court disclosure order against Addleshaws, their IT department, then headed by a Peter Thompson, told the Court that they had found the relevant back-up tapes but were unable to play them (which the Court accepted). In view of that being extremely unlikely and of the serious and costly (over ¬£1m) nature of this matter Mr Shaw requested that the police use their specialised IT resources to search those tapes. The police refused because they said that the Crown Court would be very unlikely to allow it given Addleshaws prior statement to the Court. Mr Shaw then made an application, for judicial review of that decision of the police, in London. Mr Justice Ouseley, Head of the Administrative Court refused permission on the basis that he had no power to overturn a decision of the police. He said at paragraph 13 of his judgment, \\"I have understood why Mr Shaw says what he says and his feeling that the police are not pursuing a case where he is firmly of the view that solicitors are getting away with it, if I can put it colloquially but I think it expresses his feeling\\". Mr Shaw says he could not have put it better but the judgment leaves him in the position that he believes that the British police and legal system have let him down badly and have deliberately and cynically blocked his ability to establish the truth. Mr Goodstone has moved on to the position of Head of Law at Ernst and Young in the UK.

On that day two celebrations take place consecutively. The first one, of religious nature, starts with a mass and the procession of the image of the saint from the parish church (Iglesia de Santa Eulalia) to St. Roch's Chapel. Thousands of people accompany the image during its way, which is carried out moving to the beat of the Triunfo paso doble. Subsequently, the second celebration takes place, what is called Festa da Auga (\\"the water festival\\"). Thousands of people from all ages go through the streets shouting for water (\\"¬°agua!\\"). The neighbors respond to their prayers by throwing water from the windows with buckets, hoses, etc. The goal is to get everybody wet. In addition, the city firefighters cooperate by drenching the participants from the firetrucks. The celebration does not end until the beginning of the evening. A certain area, comprising the main streets of the city, is designated as \\"the wet area\\", where getting wet is well received. Usually between 20,000 and 30,000 people take part in the Water festival. During that week other activities take places as well: free concerts from Spanish bands, Galician folk dance and music, parades, etc. One of the most important events is the Combate Naval (naval fight), a fireworks display that gives the final touch to the festival.

PSUC viu emerged from factional fighting within the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) in the mid-1990s. Since 1936, PSUC has been the Catalan referent of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). PSUC and PCE exist as parallel parties, and PCE does not organize any branch of its own in Catalonia. History In the 1980s, PCE and PSUC developed in different ways. Just as PCE took part in setting up the United Left (IU) coalition, PSUC had launched the coalition Initiative for Catalonia (IC). But whereas PCE maintained its character as an independent party, PSUC gradually became a dormant structure within IC. The party leadership of PSUC worked towards converting IC into a political party and dissolving PSUC into it. In January 1990, a national conference of PSUC was held, which decided that the political action of PSUC would be carried out within the framework of IC. Likewise a decision was taken on a Central Committee meeting of PSUC on 22 March 1991 that all PSUC members automatically would be members of IC. The 8th congress of PSUC was supposed to have been held in 1992, but was never convoked. In 1995, the tradition of holding the Festa de Treball, a of the PSUC organ Treball, was cancelled by IC, allegedly on grounds of lack of finances. At the 4th national conference of IC, held in November 1996, the internal opposition within PSUC raised their voice. The group around 'Manifesto for PSUC' was organized as the Red, Green and Violet Collective (Col¬∑lectiu Roig, Verd i Violeta). The opposition grouped around the Manifesto wanted to maintain PSUC as a separate communist party and was IC as a strategic front of the party. The opposition launched, for the first time, their own alternative candidate for the presidency of IC, Ramon Luque. The 8th congress of PSUC was finally convoked for 10 May 1997. At the congress, the group around the Manifesto was defeated, and PSUC ceased to function as an independent party. The minority then left PSUC and IC, and by June the same year they had reorganized themselves as PSUC viu. Quickly PCE recognized PSUC viu as their new Catalan referent. Parallel to this, the other main communist party in Catalonia, the Party of the Communists of Catalonia (PCC, which had formed part of IC but left it), called for unity amongst the Catalan communists. In 1998, a new coalition was constructed by PSUC viu and PCC, the United and Alternative Left (EUiA). EUiA became the new Catalan referent of IU. However, the founding of EUiA was by no means uncomplicated as the founders of PSUC viu had belonged to opposing factions in the intense inner-party conflicts in PSUC in the early 1980s. At that time, the founders of PSUC viu had been aligned with the Eurocommunist majority. That conflict ended with the departure of the pro- Soviet faction and their creation of PCC. Although PSUC viu is an independent party, it takes part in PCE congresses as a PCE regional federation. Members of PCE who move to Catalonia become members of PSUC viu and, likewise, members of PSUC viu who settle anywhere else in Spain become members of PCE. The central organ of PSUC viu is Nou Treball. The youth wing of the party was the Young Communists (JC), although following its 2014 dissolution it was again reconstituted in 2015 as JSUC (Joventut Socialista Unificada de Catalunya). PSUC viu works for the establishment of a democratic and federal republic in Spain, in which different nationalities were given the right to self- determination. In its 2017 congress, PSUC viu elected Eduard Navarro as general secretary, and the party included again Marxism‚ÄìLeninism as its core identity.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper from 1989 until 2009 playing for numerous clubs, notably in the Premier League for Coventry City and in the Scottish Premier League for Celtic. He also played in the Football League for Halifax Town, West Bromwich Albion, Bradford City, Gillingham, Preston North End, Hereford United and Bristol City. He joined New Zealand side Hawke's Bay United as player/manager in 2006, before moving to Wellington Phoenix as player/assistant coach in 2009. Personal life Gould is the elder son of former Wales and Wimbledon manager Bobby Gould. His son Matthew was a goalkeeper at Spennymoor Town, and has just signed for Altrincham FC (August 2020)altrinchamfc.com Club career Gould had a spell in New Zealand in 1989 playing for Napier City Rovers, where he won the New Zealand National Soccer League. Of note, Gould could not get a game in goal for Napier City Rovers and instead played for them as a defender. He returned to Britain and played for Clevedon Town, Halifax Town and West Bromwich Albion before making his name at Coventry City for whom he played 27 games between 1992 and 1996; first under his father Bobby and later under Phil Neal. He was given a free transfer by the Sky Blues in 1996 and joined 2nd Division Bradford City on deadline day. In May 1996 he played in Bradford City's 2-0 play off final victory against Notts County at Wembley, earning the club promotion to Division One (now known as The Championship). The following season, he was replaced at Bradford by Mark Schwarzer. Celtic plucked Gould from Bradford City's reserves in August 1997 and he made his debut on 9 August 1997 in a 7‚Äì0 away win over Berwick Rangers in the Scottish League Cup. He quickly became one of the mainstays of the great championship winning side that prevented Rangers completing 10 in a row. Gould kept 24 clean sheets in 48 appearances that season and his performance in a gruelling 1‚Äì0 win over Aberdeen at Pittodrie in March 1998 was particularly outstanding. In addition to his league championship winner's medal, Gould also picked a Scottish League Cup winner's medal that season in Celtic's 3‚Äì0 win over Dundee United in November 1997. He continued as the No 1 under the stewardship of Josef Venglos and John Barnes. During 1999‚Äì2000 Gould generally remained the first-choice goalkeeper at Parkhead despite the arrival of Dmitri Kharine, and picked up another Scottish League Cup winner's medal when Celtic defeated Aberdeen 2‚Äì0 in the final on 19 March 2000. Another highlight that season was saving a penalty from Ronen Harazi in a UEFA Cup tie against Hapoel Tel Aviv to help his side progress. However, despite opening the 2000-01 Treble winning season as first choice and playing in the opening 13 league fixtures, Martin O'Neill signed Rab Douglas as a replacement. Douglas soon became first choice at Celtic, although Gould completed his hat- trick of Scottish League Cup winner's medals that season with Celtic's 3‚Äì0 win over Kilmarnock in the final on 18 March 2001 (Douglas was cup-tied having played for Dundee in an earlier round of the tournament). He also collected his second league championship winner's medal courtesy of his appearances earlier that season. Despite his lack of first-team football at Celtic thereafter, Gould remained at the club for a further 3 years having been offered an extended contract by the manager, before eventually joining Preston North End on a free transfer in January 2003.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/2642999.stm It was during this time at Preston that Gould enjoyed a renaissance in his form which resulted in a call-up into the Scotland Squad for the European Championship play-off games against Holland. At the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season Gould went on loan to Hereford United where he made 15 appearances. He then signed for Bristol City on a free transfer in 2005 but after three months was released and it was then that he decided to retire from European football. After becoming a member of staff at Hawke's Bay United, Gould played occasionally for the team in the NZFC. As recently as 30 August 2009, Gould donned the gloves again, this time for the Wellington Phoenix in their 2‚Äì0 loss away to Sydney FC. Gould was on the bench as the reserve keeper due to the club's number one, Mark Paston being unavailable due to the birth of his first child. Had he come on, he would have been the oldest player to make an A-League appearance. International career Gould qualified to play for Scotland on the basis that his grandparents came from Blantyre in Lanarkshire. After an outstanding season at Celtic, he was called up to the international side for the 1998 World Cup but was third choice behind Jim Leighton and Neil Sullivan. After the competition he remained in the squad deputising for Sullivan and won his first cap on 9 October 1999 in a 3‚Äì0 win over Lithuania at Hampden in a qualifier tie for Euro 2000. Gould won his second and last cap a year later on 15 November 2000 in a 0‚Äì2 defeat in a friendly at Hampden against Australia. Upon losing his first team place at Celtic to Rab Douglas, Gould drifted out of the international scene. His form at Preston North End a couple of years later won him a recall to the squad in November 2003 for the two-legged Euro 2004 qualifier against the Netherlands, albeit he did not play in either game. Coaching & management career In 2006, he became manager of New Zealand club Hawke's Bay United, assisted by his father Bobby Gould. In 2009, he left this role to take up an assistant coaching position with Wellington Phoenix FC. After two seasons with the Phoenix both of which resulted in the club reaching the finals series, Gould left to join Perth Glory and work alongside his former Rangers adversary Ian Ferguson. It was announced on 26 April 2012 Gould was returning to New Zealand on a two-year deal to continue his previous role as goalkeeping coach with the Wellington Phoenix. On 16 February 2015 Jonathan Gould joined West Bromwich Albion as their first-team goalkeeping coach, working for manager Tony Pulis. After Pulis moved to Middlesbrough, Gould was appointed to the goalkeeping coach position there in January 2018. Gould was released from his position at Middlesbrough in May 2019.

Banded gneiss with dike of granite orthogneiss; competent banded gneiss is boudinaged by ductile shear. Boudin on the Island of Uto, Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden Boudinage is a geological term for structures formed by extension, where a rigid tabular body such as hornfels, is stretched and deformed amidst less competent surroundings. The competent bed begins to break up, forming sausage- shaped boudins. Boudinage is common and can occur at any scale, from microscopic to lithospheric, and can be found in all terranes.Marques, Fernando O., Pedro D. Fonseca, Sarah Lechmann, Jean-Pierre Burg, Ana S. Marques, Alexandre J.m. Andrade, and Carlos Alves. \\"Boudinage in Nature and Experiment.\\" Tectonophysics 526-529 (2012): 88-96. In lithospheric-scale tectonics, boudinage of strong layers can signify large-scale creep transfer of rock matter. The study of boudinage can, also, help provide insight to the forces involved in tectonic deformation of rocks and their strength. Boudinage can develop in two ways: planar fracturing into rectangular fragments or by necking or tapering into elongate depressions and swells.Arslan, Arzu, Cees W. Passchier, and Daniel Koehn. \\"Foliation Boudinage.\\" Journal of Structural Geology 30.3 (2008): 291-309. Boudins are typical features of sheared veins and shear zones where, due to stretching along the shear foliation and shortening perpendicular to this, rigid bodies break up. This causes the resulting boudin to take a characteristic sausage or barrel shape. They can also form rectangular structures. Ductile deformation conditions also encourage boudinage rather than imbricate fracturing. Boudins can become separated by fractures or vein material, this zone of separation is known as boudin necks. In three dimensions, the boudinage may take the form of ribbon- like boudins or chocolate-tablet boudins, depending on the axis and isotropy of extension. They range in size from about 20 m thick to about 1 cm.\\"boudinage.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 06 Oct. 2010 . Types There are three different types of boudinage. These include no-slip boudinage, s-slip boudinage, and a-slip boudinage. No-slip boudinage occurs when there is no slip, resulting in a symmetrical structure. S-slip boudinage occurs when the boudin moves in opposition to the shear movement, where A-slip occurs when it moves with the direction of the shear. These types can be further classified into 5 different groups with relation to their general shape. These groups are drawn, torn, domino, gash and shearband boudins. In general, drawn and torn shapes form where there is a no-slip boudinage, domino and gash boudins by A-slip and shearband boudins by S-slip boudinage. Etymology Lohest (1909) coined the term boudinage which is derived from the French word \\"boudin\\", meaning blood sausage. Boudins were first observed and described by Belgian geologists in the Collignon quarry near Bastogne in the Ardennes (Belgium). References Urai, J.

Etymology The specific name, beddomii, is in honor of Richard Henry Beddome, 1830‚Äì1911, British army officer and botanist.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Otocryptis bedomii, p. 21). The common name, Indian kangaroo lizard, is derived from the lizard's habit of running on its hind legs with the body held upright. Geographic range O. beddomii is endemic to Western Ghats, where it is known from Sivagiri Hills (type locality), Agasthyamalai, Cardamom Hills and Travancore hills in Tamil Nadu and Kerala states. Description left From snout to vent O. beddomii is about long with a tail of about . The head is covered in scales that have a sharp keel running along the centre, a feature also found in the Sri Lankan species (O. nigristigma and O. wiegmanni ). The scales on the head between the eyes are smaller and form about two or three longitudinal series. An inverted Y shape is formed by the keels of the scales but is indistinct. The canthus rostralis (or snout) is not prominent. There are 9 or 10 scales on the upper and lower lip. There are small pits on each side of the neck and in front of the shoulder. The scales on the back are unequal in size with the larger ones forming regular V-shaped marks with the point facing backwards, enlarged ones sometimes forming regular chevrons on the back, with the point facing backward. The scales on the underside are larger than those above. The scales on the side are small but with large scales interspersed. The scales on the upper side of the legs are large and keeled. When the hind leg is held along the body, the tip of the foot reaches the snout, the heel reaching the ear opening. The tail is round and slender and about two times the length of the head and body. The tail is covered by strongly keeled scales. The colour is olive brown with patches of dark brown on the back and limbs. A dark oblique band runs below the eye to the mouth. The underside is whitish, and young lizards have a brown throat. xii + 436 pp. + Plates I-XXXII. (Otocryptis beddomii, new species, pp. 272-273 + Plate XXIII, figure 1). Habitat The preferred habitat of O. beddomii is moist leaf litter on the forest floor of both evergreen and deciduous forests, but it may also climb onto low tree trunks and shrubs.Das I (2002).

While researchers of the 18th century had largely rejected the story of the Trojan War as fable, the discoveries made by Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik reopened the question in modern terms, and the subsequent excavation of Troy VIIa and the discovery of the toponym \\"Wilusa\\" in Hittite correspondence has made it plausible that the Trojan War cycle was at least remotely based on a historical conflict of the 12th century BC, even if the poems of Homer are removed from the event by more than four centuries of oral tradition. History In antiquity, educated Greeks accepted the truth of human events depicted in the Iliad and Odyssey, even as philosophical scepticism was undermining faith in divine intervention in human affairs. In the time of Strabo, topographical disquisitions discussed the identity of sites mentioned by Homer. This continued when Greco-Roman culture was Christianised: Eusebius of Caesarea offered universal history reduced to a timeline, in which Troy received the same historical weight as Abraham, with whom Eusebius' Chronologia began, ranking the Argives and Mycenaeans among the kingdoms ranged in vertical columns, offering biblical history on the left (verso), and secular history of the kingdoms on the right (recto).Eusebius' chronological tables are re-analysed in depth by Richard W. Burgess, Witold Witakowski, eds.Studies in Eusebian and Post-Eusebian Chronography vol. 1. (Stuttgart) 1999; see Introduction and Overview Jerome's Chronicon followed Eusebius, and all the medieval chroniclers began with summaries of the universal history of Jerome. With such authorities accepting it, post-Roman Europeans continued to accept Troy and the events of the Trojan War as historical. Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudo-genealogy traced a Trojan origin for royal Briton descents in Historia Regum Britanniae.Analysed in Francis Ingledew, \\"The Book of Troy and the Genealogical Construction of History: The Case of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia regum Britanniae\\" Speculum 69,.3 (July 1994:665-704). Merovingian descent from a Trojan ancestor was embodied in a literary myth first established in Fredegar's chronicle (2.4, 3.2.9), to the effect that the Franks were of Trojan stock and adopted their name from King Francio, who had built a new Troy on the banks of the river Rhine (modern Treves).Peter G. Bietenholz, Historia and Fabula: Myths and Legends in Historical Thought 1994:190. However, even before the so-called Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century these supposed facts of the medieval concept of history were doubted by Blaise Pascal: \\"Homer wrote a romance, for nobody supposes that Troy and Agamemnon existed any more than the apples of the Hesperides. He had no intention to write history, but only to amuse us.\\"Pascal, Pens√©es (published 1660), part ix, ¬ß628. During the 19th century the stories of Troy were devalued as fables by George Grote.In Grote, A History of Greece, vol. I (1846), \\"Legendary Greece\\" prefaces \\"Historical Greece to the reign of Peisistratus\\", and begins the \\"historical\\" section with the traditional date of the first Olympiad, 776 BC: \\"To confound together these disparate matters is, in my judgement, essentially unphilosophical. I describe the earlier times by themselves, as conceived by the faith and feeling of the first Greeks, and known only through their legends,‚Äîwithout presuming to measure how much or how little of historical matter these legends may contain\\" (Preface). The \\"Legend of Troy\\"‚Äî\\"this interesting fable\\"‚Äîfills his chapter xv. The discoveries made by Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik revived the question during modern times, and recent discoveries have resulted in more discussion. According to Jeremy B. Rutter, archaeological finds thus far can neither prove nor disprove whether Hisarlik VIIa was sacked by Mycenaean Greeks sometime between 1325 and 1200 BC.Rutter, Jeremy B., \\"Troy VII and the Historicity of the Trojan War\\", Dartmouth College No text or artefact found on the site itself clearly identifies the Bronze Age site by name. This is due probably to the levelling of the former hillfort during the construction of Hellenistic Ilium (Troy IX), destroying the parts that most likely contained the city archives. A single seal of a Luwian scribe has been found in one of the houses, proving the presence of written correspondence in the city, but not a single text. Research by Anatolian specialists indicates that what is called \\"Troy\\" was in the Late Bronze Age known to the Hittites as the kingdom of Wilusa, and that it appears that there were several armed conflicts in the area at the end of the Late Bronze Age,Korfmann, Manfred. \\"Was There a Trojan War?\\", Archaeology, Vol. 57 Number 3, May/June 2004 although this does not identify the combatants. The bilingual toponymy of Troy/Ilion is well established in the Homeric tradition. The Mycenaean Greeks of the 13th century BC had colonized the Greek mainland and Crete, and were beginning to make forays into Anatolia. Philologist Joachim Latacz identifies the \\"Achaioi\\" of the Illiad with the inhabitants of Ahhiyawa. He posits that in all probability the Iliad preserved through oral hexameters the memory of one or more acts of aggression perpetrated by the Ahhiyawans against Wilusa in the thirteenth century B.C.Latacz, Joachim. \\"Evidence from Homer\\", Archaeology, Vol. 57 Number 3, May/June 2004 Status of the Iliad The more that is known about Bronze Age history, the clearer it becomes that it is not a yes-or-no question but one of educated assessment of how much historical knowledge is present in Homer, and whether it represents a retrospective memory of Dark Age Greece, as Finley concludes, or of Mycenaean Greece, which is the dominant view of A Companion to Homer, A.J.B. Wace and F.H. Stebbings, eds. (New York/London: Macmillan 1962). The particular narrative of the Iliad is not an account of the war, but a tale of the psychology, the wrath, vengeance and death of individual heroes, which assumes common knowledge of the Trojan War as a back-story. No scholars now assume that the individual events of the tale (many of which involve divine intervention) are historical fact; however, no scholars claim that the story is entirely devoid of memories of Mycenaean times. However, in addressing a separate controversy, Oxford Professor of Greek, Martin L. West indicated that such an approach \\"misconceives\\" the problem, and that Troy probably fell to a much smaller group of attackers in a much shorter time.West, Martin L., \\"Academic spat over Troy project\\", The Times, 20 August 2001 The Iliad as essentially legendary Map of the Mycenaean culture area 1400-1200 BC (unearthed sites in red dots) Some archaeologists and historians, most notably, until his death in 1986, Finley,Finley vigorously attacked Michael Wood's In Search of the Trojan War when it first appeared in 1984, four years before modern archaeology was undertaken at the Hisarlik site. maintain that none of the events in Homer's works are historical. Others accept that there may be a foundation of historical events in the Homeric narrative, but say that in the absence of independent evidence it is not possible to separate fact from myth. Moses I. Finley, in The World of Odysseus presents a picture of the society represented by the Iliad and the Odyssey, avoids the question as \\"beside the point that the narrative is a collection of fictions from beginning to end\\" Finley was in a minority when his World of Odysseus first appeared in 1954. With the understanding that war was the normal state of affairs, Finley observed that a ten-year war was out of the question, indicating Nestor's recall of a cattle- raid in Elis as a norm, and identifying the scene in which Helen points out to Priam the Achaean leaders in the battlefield, as \\"an illustration of the way in which one traditional piece of the story was retained after the war had ballooned into ten years and the piece had become rationally incongruous.\\" Finley, for whom the Trojan War is \\"a timeless event floating in a timeless world\\", analyzes the question of historicity, aside from invented narrative details, into five essential elements: 1. Troy was destroyed by a war; 2. the destroyers were a coalition from mainland Greece; 3. the leader of the coalition was a king named Agamemnon; 4. Agamemnon's overlordship was recognized by the other chieftains; 5. Troy, too, headed a coalition of allies. Finley does not find any evidence for any of these elements. Aside from narrative detail, Finley pointed out that, aside from some correlation of Homeric placenames and Mycenaean sites, there is also the fact that the heroes lived at home in palaces (oikoi) unknown in Homer's day; far from a nostalgic recall of the Mycenaean age, Finley asserts that \\"the catalog of his errors is very long\\". > \\"His arms bear a resemblance to the armour of his time, quite unlike the > Mycenaean, although he persistently casts them in antiquated bronze, not > iron. His gods had temples, and the Mycenaeans built none, whereas the > latter constructed great vaulted tombs to bury their chieftains in and the > poet cremates his. A neat little touch is provided by the battle chariots. > Homer had heard of them, but he did not really visualize what one did with > chariots in a war. So his heroes normally drove from their tents a mile or > less away, carefully dismounted, and then proceeded to battle on foot.\\" What the poet believed he was singing about was the heroic past of his own Greek world, Finley concludes. During recent years scholars have suggested that the Homeric stories represented a synthesis of many old Greek stories of various Bronze Age sieges and expeditions, fused together in the Greek memory during the \\"dark ages\\" which followed the end of the Mycenean civilization. In this view, no historical city of Troy existed anywhere: the name perhaps derives from a people called the Troies, who probably lived in central Greece. The identification of the hill at Hisarlƒ±k as Troy is, in this view, a late development, following the Greek colonisation of Asia Minor during the 8th century BC. It is also worth comparing the details of the Iliadic story to those of older Mesopotamian literature‚Äîmost notably, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Names, set scenes, and even major parts of the story, are strikingly similar.Martin West, The East Face of Helicon (Oxford 1999), pp. 336-338; T.B.L. Webster, From Mycenae to Homer (London 1958) pp. 82, 119ff. Some academics believe that writing first came to Greece from the east, via traders, and these older poems were used to demonstrate the uses of writing, thus heavily influencing early Greek literature. The Iliad as essentially historical Map of the Troad (Troas). Another opinion is that Homer was heir to an unbroken tradition of oral epic poetry reaching back some 500 years into Mycenaean times. The case is set out in The Singer of Tales by Albert B. Lord, citing earlier work by folklorist and mythographer Milman Parry. In this view, the poem's core could represent a historical campaign that took place at the eve of the decline of the Mycenaean civilization. Much legendary material may have been added, but in this view it is meaningful to ask for archaeological and textual evidence corresponding to events referred to in the Iliad. Such a historical background gives a credible explanation for the geographical knowledge of Troy (which could, however, also have been obtained in Homer's time by visiting the traditional site of the city, which was in fact New Ilium, built at the base of the hill at Hisarlƒ±k) and otherwise unmotivated elements in the poem (in particular the detailed Catalogue of Ships). Linguistically, a few verses of the Iliad suggest great antiquity, because they only fit the meter if projected back into Mycenaean Greek, in part due to the classical loss of the digamma; this trace of archaic language suggests a poetic tradition spanning the Greek Dark Ages. On the other hand, there are well-known interpolations in the text we have. Even though Homer was Ionian, the Iliad reflects the geography known to the Mycenaean Greeks, showing detailed knowledge of the mainland but not extending to the Ionian Islands or Anatolia, which suggests that the Iliad reproduces an account of events handed down by tradition, to which the author did not add his own geographical knowledge. The Iliad as partly historical As mentioned above, though, it is most likely that the Homeric tradition contains elements of historical fact and elements of fiction interwoven. Homer describes a location, presumably in the Bronze Age, with a city. This city was near Mount Ida in northwest Turkey. Such a city did exist, at the mound of Hisarlƒ±k. =Homeric evidence= Map of Bronze Age Greece as described in Homer's Iliad Also, the Catalogue of Ships mentions a great variety of cities, some of which, including Athens, were inhabited both in the Bronze Age and in Homer's time, and some of which, such as Pylos, were not rebuilt after the Bronze Age. This suggests that the names of no-longer-existing towns were remembered from an older time, because it is unlikely that Homer would have managed to name successfully a diverse list of important Bronze Age cities that were, in his time, only a few blocks of rubble on the surface, often without even names. Furthermore, the cities enumerated in the Catalogue are given in geographical clusters, this revealing a sound knowledge of Aegean topography. Some evidence is equivocal: locating the Bronze Age palace of Sparta, the traditional home of Menelaus, under the modern city has been challenging, though archaeologists have discovered at least one Mycenaean era site about 7.5 miles outside of Sparta. =Mycenaean evidence= Likewise, in the Mycenaean Greek Linear B tablets, some Homeric names appear, including Achilles (Linear B: , a-ki-re-u),The word a-ki-re-u which is found on the KN Vc 106 tablet, has been identified as Akhilleus. a name which was also common in the classical period, noted on tablets from both Knossos and Pylos. The Achilles of the Linear B tablet is a shepherd, not a king or warrior, but the very fact that the name is an authentic Bronze Age name is significant. These names in the Homeric poems presumably remember, if not necessarily specific people, at least an older time when people's names were not the same as they were when the Homeric epics were written down. Some story elements from the tablets appear in the Iliad. =Hittite evidence= The first person to point to the Hittite texts as a possible primary source was the Swiss scholar Emil Forrer in the 1920s and 1930s. In discussing an ethnic group called the Ahhiyawa in these texts, Forrer drew attention to the place names Wilusa and Taruisa, which he argued were the Hittite way of writing Wilios (œúŒØŒªŒπŒøœÇ, old form of Œôlios) and Troia (Troy). He also noted the mention of a Wilusan king Alaksandu, who had concluded a treaty with the Hittite king Muwatalli; the name of this king closely resembled Alexandros/Alexander, the alternative name of Paris, the son of king Priam. Other identifications Forrer offered included Priam with Piyama-Radu, and Eteocles, king of Orchomenos, with one Tawagalawa. However, despite his arguments, many scholars dismissed Forrer's identification of Wilusa-(W)ilios/Troia-Taruisa as either improbable or at least unprovable, since until recently the known Hittite texts provided no clear indication where the kingdom of Wilusa was located beyond somewhere in Western Anatolia. General scholarly opinion about this identification changed with the discovery of a text join to the Manapa-Tarhunda letter, which located Wilusa beyond the Seha River near the Lazpa land. Modern scholars identify the Seha with the Classical Caicus River, which is the modern Bakƒ±r√ßay, and the Lazpa land is the more familiar isle of Lesbos. As Trevor Bryce observes, \\"This must considerably strengthen the possibility that the two were directly related, if not identical.\\" Despite this evidence, the surviving Hittite texts do not provide an independent account of the Trojan War. The Manapa-Tarhunda letter is about a member of the Hittite ruling family, Piyama-Radu, who gained control of the kingdom of Wilusa, and whose only serious opposition came from the author of this letter, Manapa-Tarhunda. King Muwatalli of the Hittites was the opponent of this king of Troy, and the result of Muwatalli's campaign is not recorded in the surviving texts. The Ahhiyawa, generally identified with the Achaean Greeks, are mentioned in the Tawagalawa letter as the neighbors of the kingdom of Wilusa, and who provided a refuge for the troublesome renegade Piyama-Radu. The Tawagalawa letter mentions that the Hittites and the Ahhiyawa fought a war over Wilusa. =Geological evidence= In November 2001, geologists John C. Kraft from the University of Delaware and John V. Luce from Trinity College, Dublin presented the results Confex. of investigations into the geology of the region that had started in 1977. The geologists compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the Iliad and other classical sources, notably Strabo's Geographia. Their conclusion was that there is regularly a consistency between the location of Troy as Hisarlik (and other locations such as the Greek camp), the geological evidence, and descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the Iliad.

The problem of approximate string matching is typically divided into two sub-problems: finding approximate substring matches inside a given string and finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately.  Overview The closeness of a match is measured in terms of the number of primitive operations necessary to convert the string into an exact match. This number is called the edit distance between the string and the pattern. The usual primitive operations are: * insertion: cot ‚Üí coat * deletion: coat ‚Üí cot * substitution: coat ‚Üí cost These three operations may be generalized as forms of substitution by adding a NULL character (here symbolized by *) wherever a character has been deleted or inserted: * insertion: co*t ‚Üí coat * deletion: coat ‚Üí co*t * substitution: coat ‚Üí cost Some approximate matchers also treat transposition, in which the positions of two letters in the string are swapped, to be a primitive operation. * transposition: cost ‚Üí cots Different approximate matchers impose different constraints. Some matchers use a single global unweighted cost, that is, the total number of primitive operations necessary to convert the match to the pattern. For example, if the pattern is coil, foil differs by one substitution, coils by one insertion, oil by one deletion, and foal by two substitutions. If all operations count as a single unit of cost and the limit is set to one, foil, coils, and oil will count as matches while foal will not. Other matchers specify the number of operations of each type separately, while still others set a total cost but allow different weights to be assigned to different operations. Some matchers permit separate assignments of limits and weights to individual groups in the pattern.  Problem formulation and algorithms  One possible definition of the approximate string matching problem is the following: Given a pattern string P = p_1p_2...p_m and a text string T = t_1t_2dots t_n, find a substring T_{j',j} = t_{j'}dots t_j in T, which, of all substrings of T, has the smallest edit distance to the pattern P. A brute-force approach would be to compute the edit distance to P for all substrings of T, and then choose the substring with the minimum distance. However, this algorithm would have the running time O(n3 m). A better solution, which was proposed by Sellers, relies on dynamic programming. It uses an alternative formulation of the problem: for each position j in the text T and each position i in the pattern P, compute the minimum edit distance between the i first characters of the pattern, P_i, and any substring T_{j',j} of T that ends at position j. For each position j in the text T, and each position i in the pattern P, go through all substrings of T ending at position j, and determine which one of them has the minimal edit distance to the i first characters of the pattern P. Write this minimal distance as E(i, j). After computing E(i, j) for all i and j, we can easily find a solution to the original problem: it is the substring for which E(m, j) is minimal (m being the length of the pattern P.) Computing E(m, j) is very similar to computing the edit distance between two strings. In fact, we can use the Levenshtein distance computing algorithm for E(m, j), the only difference being that we must initialize the first row with zeros, and save the path of computation, that is, whether we used E(i ‚àí 1,j), E(i,j ‚àí 1) or E(i ‚àí 1,j ‚àí 1) in computing E(i, j). In the array containing the E(x, y) values, we then choose the minimal value in the last row, let it be E(x2, y2), and follow the path of computation backwards, back to the row number 0. If the field we arrived at was E(0, y1), then T[y1 + 1] ... T[y2] is a substring of T with the minimal edit distance to the pattern P. Computing the E(x, y) array takes O(mn) time with the dynamic programming algorithm, while the backwards-working phase takes O(n + m) time. Another recent idea is the similarity join. When matching database relates to a large scale of data, the O(mn) time with the dynamic programming algorithm cannot work within a limited time. So, the idea is, instead of computing the similarity of all pairs of strings, to reduce the number of candidate pairs. Widely used algorithms are based on filter- verification, hashing, Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), Tries and other greedy and approximation algorithms. Most of them are designed to fit some framework (such as Map-Reduce) to compute concurrently. On-line versus off- line Traditionally, approximate string matching algorithms are classified into two categories: on-line and off-line. With on-line algorithms the pattern can be processed before searching but the text cannot. In other words, on-line techniques do searching without an index. Early algorithms for on-line approximate matching were suggested by Wagner and Fisher and by Sellers. Both algorithms are based on dynamic programming but solve different problems. Sellers' algorithm searches approximately for a substring in a text while the algorithm of Wagner and Fisher calculates Levenshtein distance, being appropriate for dictionary fuzzy search only. On-line searching techniques have been repeatedly improved. Perhaps the most famous improvement is the bitap algorithm (also known as the shift-or and shift-and algorithm), which is very efficient for relatively short pattern strings. The Bitap algorithm is the heart of the Unix searching utility agrep. A review of on-line searching algorithms was done by G. Navarro. Although very fast on-line techniques exist, their performance on large data is unacceptable. Text preprocessing or indexing makes searching dramatically faster. Today, a variety of indexing algorithms have been presented. Among them are suffix trees, metric trees and n-gram methods. A detailed survey of indexing techniques that allows one to find an arbitrary substring in a text is given by Navarro et al. A computational survey of dictionary methods (i.e., methods that permit finding all dictionary words that approximately match a search pattern) is given by Boytsov.  Applications  Common applications of approximate matching include spell checking. With the availability of large amounts of DNA data, matching of nucleotide sequences has become an important application. Approximate matching is also used in spam filtering. Record linkage is a common application where records from two disparate databases are matched. String matching cannot be used for most binary data, such as images and music. They require different algorithms, such as acoustic fingerprinting.

She became the first British swimmer to win a World Championship title, when she won the Women's 200m Back at the 2003 World Championships. She is twice an Olympian and has represented Great Britain in four World Championships, the first in 1998 when she was 16, and in three Commonwealth Games. She was given the MBE for services to swimming in the 2004 New Year Honours list. Early life Katy was born in Portsmouth. She attended Springfield School from 1994 to 1998. It was there that she learned to swim and where she returned to train for Olympic trials in early 2012, but can remember splashing around in pools when she was about three years old. Katy began her career by coming third in the European Youth Olympics in 1995. She had the desire and motivation to succeed at an even higher level with a grueling daily schedule of early morning training (5.30-7.30am), school and then training again for 2 hours in the evening. This helped Katy prepare for the Olympic Games. Sexton first appeared on the senior scene at the age of 15 with her first taste of what it was all about being the youngest member of the GB World Championship team in Perth, Australia in 1998. International career = 1997= Having broken various British junior records in this year, and finishing second in the 100m backstroke at European juniors, Katy was selected to represent Great Britain at senior level for the first time. =1998= In this year Katy competed at the senior World Championships in Perth for the first time, having been let off from school to do so. Following this, there was the Swimming World Cup where Sexton broke 5 British junior records. But by far and away her biggest achievement this year was when she competed at the 1998 Commonwealth Games held at Kuala Lumpur and winning the 200m backstroke title at the age of 16 in a time of 2:13.18 =1999= World Short Course in Hong Kong where she swam backstroke in the medley team where they broke the British record. Competed at the European Long Course Championships held in Istanbul just missing out on a medal in the 200m backstroke by 0.2 of a second. Sexton did gain a bronze in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay along with Zoe Baker, Sue Rolph and Karen Pickering. Competed at the European Short Course Championships held at Lisbon. Once again Katy came fourth in the individual 100m backstroke and broke the British record once again in the 4x50m medley relay. Became the ASA National British Championships 50 metres backstroke champion and the 100 metres backstroke champion. =2000= Broke British record in the 200m backstroke in a time of 2:13.00 at the US Nationals in Seattle. On 16 April, Sexton's club side, Portsmouth Northsea Swimming Club, won the Speedo League final at Coventry. In this year, Katy qualified for the Olympics for the first time in Sydney. In the 100m backstroke she narrowly missed the final finishing in equal 10th overall. In the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay the GB team finished 7th in the final once again breaking the British record. Competed at the European Short Course Championships held at Valencia winning a silver medal in the 100m backstroke in a time of 1:00.04. Retained 100 metres backstroke British title. =2001= Competed in the Swimming World Cup in Sheffield breaking the British record for the 200m backstroke with a time of 2:08.13. In the Long Course World Championships in Fukuoka Katy made the semi finals in both the 100m and 200m backstroke. On 19 September Katy woke with a stabbing pain in her back. Diagnosis by the Team GB doctors revealed brachial neuritus, also known as Parsonage‚ÄìTurner syndrome. As a consequence, Sexton was out of competitive action for 6 months, but continued to train in the water just using legs only. =2002= Competed at the 2002 Commonwealth Games held at Manchester, where she finished third behind Sarah Price in the 200m backstroke. =2003= At the British Trials on 20 March 2003, Katy Sexton shattered the Commonwealth record to book her place at the World Championships in 1min 00.49sec, the sixth fastest ever at that time. Sexton, who was then coached by Chris Nesbitt in Portsmouth, had a previous best before the championships of 1min 01.80sec. Naturally, she was overjoyed: \\"O my God! I'm not going to sleep tonight,\\" she said. \\"I knew I was capable of doing a good time but had no idea I'd go that fast.\\" She put her new found speed down to the weight-training she has introduced to her programme since the Commonwealth Games in Manchester the previous year and the three-weeks training at Britain's official offshore training camp on the Gold Coast in Australia. \\"That definitely helped,\\" she said. At the World Championships, in the Women‚Äôs 100m backstroke in a closely fought final it was German Antje Buschschulte who touched the pads in 1:00.50, with Denmark‚Äôs Louise Ornstedt and Katy Sexton in a tie for silver in 1:00.86 In the Women's 200m backstroke Seventeen year-old Russian Stanislava Komarova looked the pre-race favorite in this race, having swum a PR 2:09.39 to be fastest qualifier. However, Great Britain's Katy Sexton had been just a little faster this year with a 2:09.27.The young Russian looked comfortable at the second turn, leading from Ukrainian Iryna Amshennikova with Sexton third. At the third turn Komarova still had her head in front, but it was Margaret Hoelzer moving up to second place (just 0.07 seconds behind), the Ukrainian third and Sexton next. As is often the case, the main action happens in the last fifty. Komorova was struggling and Sexton was powering home as Hoelzer also moved past the Russian. At the wall Sexton touched first, giving Great Britain its first women's gold in a NR 2:08.74 (7th all-time performer). Hoelzer took the silver in a PR 2:09.24 with Komarova holding on for the bronze in a disappointing 2:10.17. Regained 100 metres backstroke British title and won first 200 metres backstroke title. =2004= 2004 was an Olympic year with 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Going into the Games, both the 100m backstroke and the 200m backstroke were considered fairly open and up for grabs by a number of swimmers, including Katy. In the 200m final, Sexton finished 7th with a time of 2.12.11. Fourth 100 metres backstroke British title and second 200 metres backstroke title. =2005= Having qualified for the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Katy Sexton and James Gibson were the individuals who were aiming to defend their crowns. In the 200m final, Katy finished eighth in 2:13.39. =2006= Competed at the Commonwealth Games held at Melbourne where Katy made 3 finals; in the 50m, 100m and 200m backstroke. Fifth 100 metres backstroke British title. Sexton made the European Long Course in Budapest this year. It was at the end of this year that Katy started training with Mark Foster. Regained 50 metres backstroke British title. =2007= European Short Course in Debrecen, Hungary where she made two finals breaking the British senior record in the 50m backstroke in 27:99. Sixth 100 metres backstroke British title and third 50 metres title. =2008= Katy just missed out on the Beijing Olympics, when she finished 3rd at the British trials behind Gemma Spofforth and Elizabeth Simmonds. =2012= At the age of 29, Katy attempted to qualify for the London 2012 Olympics at 200m backstroke. Masters career Sexton competed in K2 in Crawley for the South East Regionals Masters Championships in 2013, where she claimed double gold at the event. Her victory in the 50m backstroke in a time of 29.84secs broke her own British and European records. She also went close to setting a new British record in her 50m freestyle win at 27.23secs. ‚ÄòTo break the British and European record I set last year was pretty cool,‚Äô said Sexton, who hadn‚Äôt raced in six months.‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt actually retired full-time from the pool, I‚Äôm more in semi-retirement. So I thought I‚Äôd compete in the Masters, which is nice and relaxed, and without too much pressure. At the Marlin's Masters meet in Medina on the Isle of Wight, on 8 February 2014, Katy broke two British records for a masters race. In the 50m butterfly she knocked nearly 2 seconds off the record with a time of 29.91 sec. In the 50m freestyle she achieved a time of 26.50 sec. Coaching career Katy is determined to give something back to the Portsmouth community that supported her so well during her competitive days.Through the Katy Sexton Swim Academy, which she founded in 2010, she teaches and inspires the next generation of swimmers. Sexton says, \\"It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve just put my name on - I‚Äôm actually hands on with it.\\" Based in Havant, it has more than 300 recruits, with the former Portsmouth Northsea member hoping to unearth one or two stars of the future. She also mentors up and coming sportsmen and women from around the South Coast. Working further afield, Katy works with her fellow Olympian, good friend and former world champion at the Mark Foster Swimming Academy. In 2011, Sexton was appointed an ambassador of the Swimming Teachers' Association (STA). Tasked with promoting water safety education and to raise awareness about the importance of learning to swim, she represents the STA at key events and provides technical expertise to its 6500 members through continuous professional development courses. Jasmine Blofield, President of Junior Chamber International Portsmouth says, ‚ÄòKaty‚Äôs passion, ambition and determination makes her the perfect person share her inspirations and ideas on how we can all drive ourselves to perform at our best and achieve our goals, both personal and professional.‚Äô Charity work Stemming from her own experiences with depression, Katy Sexton is patron to Off The Record, the counseling service for 11- to 25-year-olds. In her own words, Katy says, \\"having been an international athlete for a number of years and living and growing up in Portsmouth, it‚Äôs nice to be able to give something back to my local community, so I am thrilled to be offering my support to Off The Record. Such a fantastic service is provided for all young people in the area, it‚Äôs great to be able to assist Off The Record in helping ensure this essential service is continued. Sexton also regularly takes part in charity events in the local area; she recently took part a charity swimming race, where she went head-to-head in a 100m race in the swimming pool of Springfield School in aid of Comic Relief See also * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming (women) References  External links  *Coaching 1982 births Living people English female swimmers Olympic swimmers of Great Britain Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Female backstroke swimmers Members of the Order of the British Empire Sportspeople from Portsmouth Commonwealth Games gold medallists for England Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for England Swimmers at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Swimmers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Swimmers at the 2006 Commonwealth Games World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming European Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming ","title":"Katy Sexton"},{"id":"3538010","text":"RM1 or variant, may refer to: * RM1, the postcode for a part of Romford, see RM postcode area * RM1 (Recife Model 1), a quantum computational method of calculating molecular electronic structure, a variant of Austin Model 1 * Valmet RM 1, a class of two-bogie four-axle tram, see List of Valmet products * RocketMotorOne (RM1), a Tier-1 rocket engine for SpaceShipOne * RM1, a cancelled space station Russian Research Module * RM1, a type of railcar in the NZR RM class See also * RM (disambiguation) * RMI (disambiguation) * IRM (disambiguation) * 1RM ","title":"RM1"},{"id":"3538011","text":"Chippenham railway station is on the Great Western Main Line (GWML) in South West England, serving the town of Chippenham, Wiltshire. It is down the line from and is situated between and on the GWML. The Wessex Main Line diverges from the GWML to the southwest of Chippenham and runs to via . It is managed by Great Western Railway, which also operates all the trains that call. Only two platforms at the station remain in use; the platform by the main entrance is now disused. History Station entrance (1989) The main line of the Great Western Railway (GWR) was authorised in 1835, and opened in stages: the section from westward to Chippenham opened on 31 May 1841. The final section of the line, between Chippenham and Bath, opened on 30 June 1841. Chippenham was soon served by other lines. The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (WS&WR;) was authorised in 1845 and the first section opened on 5 September 1848; this ran from Thingley Junction, west of Chippenham, to , and the WS&WR; was absorbed by the GWR in 1851. The Calne Railway was authorised in 1860 and opened on 3 November 1863; this company remained independent for some years, until absorbed by the GWR in 1892. In 1858 the station was expanded and gained a goods shed and an engine shed. A railway connection was laid to Chippenham Gas Works in 1906; this connection closed in 1932. Chippenham engine shed closed in March 1964 and services on the Calne branch ended in 1965. Chippenham East and West signal boxes closed on 21 August 1966. As from 1 February 1976 the original down platform was taken out of use and services travelling west used the south side of the island platform. =Station Masters= *Jonathan Carthew Hornblower ca. 1859‚Äì1889 *H.E.

Best ca. 1949 Description The original station building at Chippenham was built to Isambard Kingdom Brunel's design and opened in 1841. With the subsequent opening of new lines to and , the station was not adequate to meet the increased demand and was redesigned by J H Bertram in 1856 to 1858; it is a Grade II listed building, constructed in Bath Stone ashlar with a bay window at one end and a wing at the other making a long, low composition. In the station yard, there is another Grade II listed building, partly in random stone but mainly weather-boarded on a timber frame with a pitched slate roof. It is an early weighbridge house and coal merchant's office dating from around 1840. Platform view in 1989 Immediately west of the station lies the Grade II listed Chippenham viaduct designed by Brunel in 1841. The first arch, over New Road, appears to have been modelled on the Roman triumphal arch. It has a span and is flanked by two smaller pedestrian arches of . All is surmounted by a heavy cornice and parapet. The north side is faced with Bath stone ashlar with some brick patching, while the south side is in blue brick following widening in the early 1900s. Platform 1 is used for westbound Great Western Main Line services towards Bristol Temple Meads, the West Country, South Wales and is also used for Wessex Main Line services towards Southampton Central. Platform 2 is used for eastbound services towards London Paddington and Cheltenham Spa. On the disused platform there is cycle storage, a seating area and a caf√©. There are two footbridges at the station, although until 2016 one only carried a right of way over the railway. This bridge was replaced with a new one providing steps and lifts on both platforms, opening in January 2016. This work was funded under the Department for Transport's Access for All scheme, although the bridge required replacement as part of the project to electrify the Great Western main line, as it was too low for the overhead wires to fit underneath. The footbridge was closed for two weeks in September 2016, eight months after opening, due to drainage issues. It has also been criticised as no lift is provided to the car park to the north of the station, although passive provision was made for its installation in the future. Awards In 2004, the station received an award to recognise its safety and security. The award, which lasted for two years, followed a passenger survey which found that 98% of the passengers through Chippenham said they felt 'safe' or 'very safe' whilst on the premises. The station is monitored by 24-hour CCTV and is alarmed. Services A First Great Western service from London Paddington The station has frequent eastbound services to ; and westbound services to Bristol and Bath, with some extensions to Devon, Taunton, and South Wales. Currently, these trains run every half an hour in both directions and extensions to stations further afield westbound are made regularly. The \\"TransWilts\\" line from Swindon via Chippenham to , and has trains every two hours each way on weekdays and six each way on Sundays. Two southbound weekday trains continue through to , and two in the other direction to . Chippenham station connects to the Wessex Main Line via Melksham. Future There are plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line, originally for completion by 2016, but delayed until at least 2019. , completion through Chippenham is still awaited. Train operator Go-Op included Chippenham in its 2016 and 2019 plans for a service from the west of England to the West Midlands, via Oxford. The Chippenham Station Hub project aims to improve the appearance of the station's forecourt and increase parking provision by building multi-storey car parks, releasing land for development. There are seven phases, with Phase 1, the refurbishment of the booking office, having been completed and Phase 2 (redevelopment of Sadler's Mead car park) being in progress as of 2020.  Engineering works  Northwest of the station is an engineering works, established on a smaller site north of the station in 1842 by Rowland Brotherhood to support the Great Western Railway, and later supplying equipment to the worldwide rail industry. From 1894 it was home to the company which in 1935 became Westinghouse Brake and Signal, manufacturers of railway air braking and signalling equipment. Westinghouse was acquired by Hawker Siddeley in 1979, then sold to BTR in 1992. After BTR merged with Siebe to form Invensys, Westinghouse Brakes was sold in 2000 to Knorr-Bremse, who opened a new factory at Bowerhill, Melksham. The signals business remained at Chippenham and became Westinghouse Rail Systems, within Invensys Rail Group. This business was sold to Siemens in 2013 and became part of Siemens Rail Automation. Proposals submitted in 2016 for redevelopment of the site include homes, shops and a hotel as well as business space.

Etymology Both the specific name, blanfordanus, and the common name, Blanford's rock agama, are in honor of English naturalist William Thomas Blanford (1832‚Äì1905), member of the Geological Survey of India.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Psammophilus blanfordanus, p. 27). Description Male in breeding colours Although very similar to P. dorsalis, a specimen of P. blanfordanus can be separated by several features. P. blanfordanus has a deeper fold on the front of the humerus. The scales on the body are a little larger, and number from 80 to 100 round the middle of the body. The dorsal scales appear keeled and imbricated. When the hind leg is stretched forward and held along the body, it reaches the eye or extends beyond it. Often, a small spine is found behind the edge of the brow-ridge of the eye, and a few enlarged scales are scattered on the sides. Young lizards are olive-brown above, spotted or marbled with brown very similar to the female, but often have a series of large, lozenge-shaped, dark brown spots with pale centres on the back and tail. The adult male is much like P. dorsalis, but in the summer breeding season, the head and anterior part of the body of the males become scarlet or red while the posterior parts are nearly black. P. blanfordanus is found mainly on rocks. The male displays by head nodding. xiii + 440 pp. + Plate I + 2 maps. (Psammophilus blanfordanus, new combination, p. 210). Snout- to-vent length (SVL) is about , and the tail is about long. Females are slightly smaller than males. Behaviour P. blanfordanus spends most of its time resting or basking under the sun. Excess heat causes it to rest inside water holes to decrease overall body temperature. Distribution P. blanfordanus is common on many of the hills from Chota Nagpur, as high as Parasnath Hill to , Madhya Pradesh and extending south along the Godavari Districts, hills of the Eastern Ghats. The southernmost record appears to be Talayar in Travancore, where a specimen was collected by Harold S. Ferguson at .Boulenger GA (1891). \\"Description of a New Species of Lizard obtained by Mr. H.

History In the 1820s sugarcane plantations were established along the Approugue. In April 1832, the town of Approuague was founded at the site as the administrative centre of the commune, because warships could harbour there. In April 1834, the town was renamed Guisanbourg after Jean Samuel Guisan who poldered the region. On 10 August 1848, slavery was abolished, and many of the former slaves left the region for Cayenne. 1,200 contract workers were hired as replacement mainly from India. In July 1855, the Amerindian Paoline entered the town with gold. Soon after, the town started to empty to villages further upstream. R√©gina, a new town started to develop. In January 1936, Guisanbourg lost its status as administrative centre of the commune to R√©gina. In 1977, there were only 15 citizens left. The town of Guisanbourg became a ghost town in the mid-1980s. The National Road 2 (RN2) from nearby R√©gina to St-Georges de l‚ÄôOyapock was completed in 2004.

TCC, tCc, or TinyCC) is an x86, X86-64 and ARM processor C compiler created by Fabrice Bellard. It is designed to work for slow computers with little disk space (e.g. on rescue disks). Windows operating system support was added in version 0.9.23 (17 Jun 2005). TCC is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. TCC claims to implement all of ANSI C (C89/C90),Tiny C Compiler Reference Documentation accessed on 2008-08-07 much of the C99 ISO standard,According to the project's TODO list complex types are the only missing C99 feature. Variable Length Arrays have been added in TCC 0.9.26 and many GNU C extensions including inline assembly. Features TCC has a number of features that differentiate it from other current C compilers: * Its small file size (about 100 KB for the x86 TCC executable) and memory footprint allow it to be used directly from a single 1.44 M floppy disk, such as a rescue disk. * TCC is intended to produce native x86, x86-64 and ARM code very quickly; according to Bellard, it compiles, assembles and links about nine times faster than GCC does.Tiny C Compiler homepage * TCC has a number of compiler-specific language features intended to improve its practicality, such as an optional memory and bound checker, for improved code stability. * TCC allows programs to be run automatically at compile time using a command-line switch. This allows programs to be run as a shell script under Unix-like systems that support the shebang interpreter directive syntax. Compiled program performance In general, TCC's implementation emphasizes smallness instead of optimally- performing results. TCC generates code in a single pass, and does not perform most of the optimizations performed by other compilers. TCC compiles every statement on its own, and at the end of each statement register values are written back to the stack and must be re-read even if the next line uses the values in registers (creating extraneous save/load pairs between statements). TCC uses only some of the available registers (e.g., on x86 it never uses ebx, esi, or edi because they need to be preserved across function calls).Gl√∂ckner, Daniel. Re: Tinycc-devel (no subject), September 8, 2006. TCC performs a few optimizations, such as constant propagation for all operations, multiplications and divisions are optimized to shifts when appropriate, and comparison operators are specially optimized (by maintaining a special cache for the processor flags). It also does some simple register allocation, which prevents many extraneous save/load pairs inside a single statement. Here are two benchmark examples: #A recursive Fibonacci algorithm on a 1.8 GHz Intel Centrino laptop with 512 MB RAM yields a noticeable difference in results between Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 13.10.3052 and TCC. To calculate the 49th Fibonacci number, it took a MS Visual C++ program approximately 18% longer than the TCC compiled program. #With a tcc modified to compile GCC, running cc1 (the GCC C compiler) on itself required 518 seconds when compiled using GCC 3.4.2, 558 seconds using GCC 2.95.3, 545 using Microsoft C compiler, and 1145 seconds using tcc. The level of optimization in each compiler was -O1 or similar. Uses * TCCBOOT,TCCBOOT a hack where TCC loads and boots a Linux kernel from source in about 10 seconds.

An allied species, Psammophilus blanfordanus, is found in the Eastern Ghats, but north of the range of this species. Description Close-up of a male A female This species of lizard has a large head that is elongated and depressed, with the cheeks swollen in adult males. The snout is longer than the diameter of the orbit (eye cavity). The upper head scales are unequal and smooth or obtusely keeled, the scales being larger on the sinciput (brow) than on the occiput. The canthus rostralis and supraciliary (brow) has a clear and sharp edge, two small separated spines or groups of spines above the ear are present or absent; the diameter of the tympanum is half or a little more than half that of the orbit; it has 10 to 13 upper and as many lower labial scales. The body is slightly flattened; dorsal scales are small, uniform, smooth, or feebly keeled in the adult, and strongly keeled in the young, all pointing backwards and upwards; the dorsal crest is reduced to a ridge of enlarged scales; ventral scales are as large as the dorsals, and smooth (keeled in the young); from 115 to 150 scales occur around the middle of the body; the gular (under chin) scales are a little smaller than the ventral (underside) scales; four or five enlarged scales occur on the chin parallel with the anterior labials, separated from them by two rows of scales; a strong transverse fold covered with small scales is seen across the throat; the nuchal and dorsal crests are merely tooth-like protrusions. The legs are strong, covered with uniform, keeled scales; the hind limb when extended forward in a specimen reaches the ear or the rear end of the eye, and further forward in younger individuals. The tail is slightly flattened and covered with keeled scales, which are larger below than above. In the adult male, it is distinctly swollen at the base, the scales on that part of it are thickened, and those of the upper median row are enlarged. Young and females are olive-brown, spotted, speckled, or marbled with dark brown, and with a series of white, elongated spots along each side of the back. The male has pale brownish colour on the top of the head and back, while the lips are yellowish-brown, and this extends as a strip beyond the ear. A dark brown or black lateral stripe begins behind the eye and broadens to cover the lower sides. The underside is yellow with the throat mottled with grey. These lizards basks on bare rocks where they are hidden by their cryptic colouration. They feed on insects. The male in the breeding season assumes bright colours. The upper parts become fine vermilion red or yellow, the lip stripe is sometimes pink. The under surfaces, limbs, and tail are black.Smith MA. 1935.

In 2005, Sukumaran was arrested in a room at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta with eight others. Police found of heroin in a suitcase in the room. According to court testimonies of convicted drug mules, Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were the co-ringleaders of the heroin-smuggling operation from Indonesia to Australia. After a criminal trial, Sukumaran was sentenced on 14 February 2006 by the Denpasar District Court to execution by firing squad. After lodging an appeal against his sentence, Sukumaran's appeal was initially dismissed by the Bali High Court. A judicial review by the Indonesian Supreme Court on 6 July 2011 affirmed the death sentence. Sukumaran's plea for clemency was rejected by the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo on 30 December 2014. He and Chan were executed on 29 April 2015. Early life and family Sukumaran was born on 17 April 1981 in London. He was the eldest child of Sam and Raji Sukumaran who are Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin. Sukumaran had a brother (Chintu) and a sister (Brintha). The family moved to Australia in 1985 and lived in Auburn, a western suburb of Sydney. Sukumaran was educated at Homebush Boys High School where he was known as \\"Myu.\\" Although Andrew Chan also attended Homebush the pair were four years apart and mixed in different circles. Sukumaran told a psychiatrist that he faced bullying and racism at school. Only in his adolescence did he start making friends, mostly Chinese and Vietnamese, and started to feel accepted. After dropping out of university in the first year of his course, Sukumaran worked as a mail-room clerk at State Street Corporation, an American investment bank, and at the passport office in Sydney. He started using drugs and, attracted by fast cars, nightclubs and instant rewards, got involved in drug selling after a university friend introduced him to the criminal world. Sukumaran met Andrew Chan at a friend's party in 2002 and got involved in smuggling drugs from Indonesia to Australia. Trafficking conspiracy Media reports based on the testimony of co- conspirator Renae Lawrence claim that she met Sukumaran through Andrew Chan. Sometimes referred to in the media as a \\"martial arts expert\\" or \\"the enforcer\\", Sukumaran trained in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In an interview broadcast on SBS TV's Dateline program following his sentencing and appeal, Sukumaran said: According to Lawrence, following earlier alleged threats from Chan, on 5 April 2005 Sukumaran met with Si Yi Chen, Martin Stephens and Lawrence at a Sydney hotel where police allege drug smuggling tools such as sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Stephens and Lawrence. Lawrence claimed she was given cash; whilst Stephens claimed that his life was threatened. The following day, Sukumaran allegedly provided another group with cash for airflight tickets. On arrival in Bali, Sukumaran checked into the Hard Rock Hotel, where Chan had already arrived. Other members of the Bali Nine were staying at other hotels across Kuta. It is unclear what Sukumaran's movements were whilst in Bali. On the evening of 17 April, appearing like tourists, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, Chen and Matthew Norman checked into the Melasti Hotel. Sukumaran, who was also with them with his bags, left the bags with the others as he decided to go back to the Hard Rock Hotel complex. =Arrest= Sukumaran was arrested on 17 April 2005, the day of his 24th birthday, at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta with Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman. Indonesian police claim the group were in possession of of heroin and bundles of plastic wrapping, Elastoplast tape, and a set of scales, indicating involvement in a plan to transport drugs to Australia. Earlier that day at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Indonesian police also arrested the following drug mules after they were found carrying various amounts of heroin concealed on their bodies. Martin Stephens was found to be carrying ; Renae Lawrence was found to be carrying ; Michael Czugaj was found to be carrying and Scott Rush was found to be carrying of heroin. Alleged co-ringleader, Andrew Chan, was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. Sukumaran denied any involvement with the heroin seized at the airport or any heroin located at the premises upon his arrest. Up until his arrest in Indonesia, Australian and Indonesian police did not know the identity of the \\"dark skinned man\\". Indonesian police speculated that Sukumaran was Chan's bodyguard, because they were always together. =Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff= Lee Rush, the father of Scott Rush, a fellow member of the Bali Nine, said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior said he received assurances from the AFP that it would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney- General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. In 2015, Nick Xenophon, Clive Palmer and Cathie McGowan announced they would support a private member's bill to impose jail terms on public officials who disclose information that could lead to the execution of Australians overseas, with a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. Trial Criminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen, and Norman were tried together, with Sukumaran being one of the remaining six defendants tried separately. In December 2005, as the trials began, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment, with Australian lawyers counter-claiming that the fairness of the trial was in jeopardy. During the trial of Czugaj, Sukumaran refused to give testimony, stating \\"...I am also on trial.\\" During his trial, Sukumaran denied knowing Czugaj and Rush, or any knowledge of a heroin importation plan, and frequently blamed amnesia on his inability to remember events leading to his arrest. Sukumaran denied signing police statements, and when asked by judges to sign his name as an example of his signature, signed his name in four different styles. During his testimony, Sukumaran claimed he met Nguyen on the flight to Bali, and went out drinking with him, Chen, Norman and Chan whilst in Bali. =Sentencing and appeal= On 24 January 2006, prosecutors called for the death penalty to be handed down on Sukumaran, the first time a demand of death was put forward by prosecutors for any of the Bali Nine. Days later, prosecutors advanced the same call followed for Chan. Prosecutors told a Bali court there was no reason to show any leniency towards Sukumaran because he helped organise the heroin smuggling operation. Prosecutors also claim Sukumaran and Chan strapped heroin to the bodies of the fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players in what they say was a major smuggling ring. Sukumaran was found guilty of drug trafficking on 14 February 2006 by three judges in the Denpasar District Court, who sentenced him to death by firing squad. Despite being relatively free of emotion during criminal proceedings, on the day verdicts were handed down, Sukumaran lunged at photographers. The sentencing was carried live on Australian television as Sukumaran and Chan both showed little emotion during the proceedings. Commenting on the sentences at the time, AFP Commissioner Keelty stated: The Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, was reported as commenting: It was also reported that the Australian government had, since December 2005, used diplomatic channels to plead with the Indonesian government that the death penalty not be sought. Following the handing down of the death sentence for both Sukumaran and Chan, The New Zealand Herald speculated the circumstances under which the execution would occur. Julian McMahon, a Melbourne human rights lawyer who took over the case in 2006 on a pro-bono basis, appealed against the severity of Sukumaran's sentence to the Indonesian Supreme Court. During the appeal hearings, it was revealed that the governor of Kerobokan Prison described Sukumaran and Chan as model prisoners and that Sukumaran and Chan have a positive influence on other prisoners. In the meantime, the Australian Government elected to not intervene until the outcome of the appeals was known. On 7 July 2011, it was announced that the Indonesian Supreme Court had rejected Sukumaran's appeal against his death sentence. Indonesian President at that time, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, had the power to grant clemency, although media reports considered this unlikely and expected that Sukamaran would be executed. In October 2014, Joko Widodo (\\"Jokowi\\") succeeded Yudhoyono as president. Jokowi, who holds a hardline position against drugs, declined Sukumaran's plea for clemency in December 2014. In January 2015 the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, together with the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, made further representations to Jokowi and Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Retno Marsudi, for clemency on behalf of Sukumaran. In late January lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran filed an application for a judicial review into their cases; which was rejected by the Denpasar District Court a few days later. Meanwhile, Indonesian officials continued planning for the execution of Chan and Sukumaran: In a final attempt to avert the death penalty, on 9 February lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran launched a rare challenge against the Indonesian president's refusal to grant them pardons; which was dismissed by the Indonesian government a day later. On 11 February 2015, Indonesian authorities approved the transfer of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Nusa Kambangan in preparation for execution. The transfer was carried out on 4 March. =Reaction in Australia= A candlelight vigil hosted by the Mercy Campaign, entitled Music for Mercy, was held in Sydney's Martin Place on the evening of 29 January 2015 in support of Sukumaran and Chan. The concert featured performances by singer-songwriter Megan Washington, Josh Pyke, Kate Miller-Heidke, Paul Mac, Glenn Richards from Augie March, and The Presets' Julian Hamilton; with Ben Quilty, Andrew Denton, his partner, Jennifer Byrne, and Missy Higgins who recorded video messages of support for Sukumaran and Chan. Similar vigils were organised in Perth, Federation Square and Toongabbie near Sukumaran's family home. Amnesty International organised similar vigils in Federation Square, , Adelaide, Canberra, and . In January 2015, Roy Morgan Research completed a poll that found over half of Australians opposed the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The poll asked \\"Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been convicted of drug trafficking by the Indonesian courts. Should the death penalty be carried out?\\" 53% of responses were negative. However, 62% said the Australian Government should not do more to stop the execution of Sukumaran and Chan. On 13 February, Australia's foreign minister, Julie Bishop, raised the potential for a boycott of Bali as a tourism destination should the executions proceed. Former high court judge Michael Kirby stated that he expected a decline in tourism was a potential consequence of executing Chan and Sukumaran. Both Bishop and Tanya Plibersek, Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman, made pleas for clemency in the Australian parliament. Quilty and Victorian Supreme Court judge Lex Lasry visited Chan and Sukumaran in Bali. Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson addressed a vigil in Sydney on 28 April 2015, ahead of the planned execution in the early morning on 29 April, calling for last-minute intervention by the Australian Government. Prison life Sukumaran taught English, computer, graphic design and philosophy classes to prisoners. He was instrumental in opening up a computer and art room and also pushed unsuccessfully for an accountancy and law course to be set up. In February 2015 Curtin University conferred Sukumaran with an associate degree in Fine Arts. He also started a business which sells artworks and a clothing brand called Kingpin Clothing. Sukumaran was appointed head of a group of over 20 prisoners, including those facing execution and housed in the prison's maximum security wing. His role included assigning tasks to prisoners under him, liaising with the guards, resolving disputes and overseeing modest penalties for those who transgress in their jobs cleaning, gardening and making small repairs in the prison. Sukumaran painted multiple self-portraits while on Nusakambangan. His final painting resembles a bleeding Indonesian flag. Along with Andrew Chan, he converted to Christianity while imprisoned. Prior to his death, he was working on a bachelor's degree on Fine Arts from Curtin University.http://www.smh.com.au/comment/a-day-with-myuran-sukumaran-a- remarkable-artist-who-wont-give-up-in-the-face-of-bleak- destiny-20150122-12vu79.html Australian artist Matthew Sleeth, who ran art workshops inside Kerobokan prison, called him the \\"best student\\" he had seen.http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/bali-nine-myuran- sukumaran-the-best-art-student-i-ever-had-says-matthew- sleeth-20150430-1mw6n1.html Art Sukumaran had his first major Australian exhibition at the Campbelltown Arts Centre in January 2017, curated by Australian artist Ben Quilty.

Few of the X-24 engines developed saw service, and their production lifetimes were very limited. Postwar developments of the turbojet and turbofan engines obviated the need for large piston aircraft engines of this type. In the United Kingdom, Rolls-Royce produced the Vulture X-24 based on the Peregrine (which was itself a highly developed Kestrel).

This means that or and argent (gold and silver, represented by yellow and white) may not be placed on each other; nor may any of the colours (i.e. azure, gules, sable, vert and purpure, along with some other rarer examples) be placed on another colour. Heraldic furs (i.e. ermine, vair and their variants) as well as \\"proper\\" (a charge coloured as it normally is in nature ‚Äì although that may be as defined by heralds) are exempt from the rule of tincture. The rule seems to have operated from the inception of the age of heraldry, i.e. about 1200‚Äì1215, but seemingly was never written down. It was rather deduced by later commentators as a rule which must have existed, based on the evidence it produced. Although the vast majority of coats of arms ever used across the whole of Europe follow the rule, a very few coats which contravened the rule were borne in the mediaeval era by certain families or corporate bodies for many centuries without effective censure by the heraldic authorities.For example the coat of Denys of Gloucestershire was recorded regularly by the Heraldic Visitations, and in the case of Hugh Denys was well-known within the royal household of King Henry VII. The reason for the original contraventionsPossibly where an extremely high status person, such as a bishop, granted arms to a follower inadvertently in contravention of the rule, the grant was deemed immutable and beyond the authority of a secular court to alter and for the toleration of them is unknown, although in the case of the arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem clearly extreme high status was involved. Application The main duty of a heraldic device is to be easily recognisable. Certain tincture pairs are difficult to distinguish when placed atop or over each other. Specifically, a dark colour is very difficult to distinguish if it is placed on top of another dark colour, and likewise a light metal is very difficult to distinguish on top of the other light metal. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule. Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint with enamel (colour) over enamel, or with metal over metal. =Lawful exceptions= The rule of tincture does not apply to furs, nor to charges blazoned \\"proper\\" (displayed in their natural colour, which need not be a normal heraldic tincture).Fox-Davies, p. 86. The blazoning of a charge \\"proper\\" can therefore be used as a loophole when its natural coloration equates to or approaches another heraldic tincture it is desired to overlie. An example would be a white horse proper, since without breaking the rule of no metal on metal it could be placed on a field Or (gold), but a horse argent (silver horse), although visually indistinguishable, could not. Furs and charges blazoned as proper can be placed on colour, metal, fur, or charges blazoned as proper. Simple divisions of the field are considered to be beside each other, not one on top of the other; so the rule of tincture does not apply. In practice, however, fields divided into multiple partitions, such as barry or checky, use (with extremely rare exceptions) an alternating pattern of metal and colour for adjacent units. The rule also does not apply to charges placed upon party-coloured (divided) or patterned fields; a field party or patterned of a colour and metal may have a charge of either colour, metal, or party or patterned, placed on it (and there is a small body of precedent that a field party of two colours or two metals may have a charge or charges of either colour, metal, or party or patterned on it; examples of this certainly exist). Likewise, a party-coloured (of colour and metal) charge may be placed on either a colour or metal background. Neither does the rule apply to the tongue, horns, claws, hoofs of beasts (for instance, a lion Or on an azure field could be langued [with his tongue] gules) when of a different tincture than the rest of the animal, or other parts of charges that are \\"attached\\" to them; for instance, a ship sable on an Or field may have argent sails as the sails are considered to be attached on the ship rather than charged on the field. One important distinction, according to Fox-Davies, is that the rule of tincture also does not apply to crests or supporters, except in such cases as the crest or supporter itself is treated as a field and charged with one or more objects.Fox-Davies, p. 87. For instance, a gold collar about the neck of an argent supporter is common, but if eagle wings are used as a crest and charged with a trefoil (such as the coat of arms of Brandenburg), the trefoil must conform to the rule of tincture. Another apparent violation that is not regarded as such is the \\"very uncommon\\" practice of a bordure of the same tincture of the field being blazoned as \\"embordured\\"; while well known in former times this is unusual in the extreme today.Balfour Paul, p. xiv. How technical the rule is can be seen by the fact that if this were blazoned as Gules... a bordure of the field..., though of identical appearance, it would be considered a blatant violation. The colours bleu celeste and the U.S. Institute of Heraldry-invented buff have sometimes been treated (with respect to the rule of tincture) as if they are metals, though such a treatment is certainly of debatable propriety. Marks of cadency (whether bordures,Boutell (p. 43), mistakenly, extends the rule to all bordures. the marks of the English cadency system, or any other mark), and presumably marks of distinction, can be exceptions to this rule. For example, many members of the French royal house had a red border or bend against the blue field. Also, in Great Britain, cantons added to indicate baronetcy of Ulster (argent, a hand couped gules) ignore this rule; otherwise they could be displayed by no one with a metal field. Augmentations and abatements do not have to conform to the rule. Another violation which is usually not worried about is a green mount on a blue field representing the sky, and some of the methods of depicting the sea, waves or the like are similarly treated. A green trimount also appears in the coat of arms of Hungary (shown below). In this case the field is gules (red); the rule of tincture should therefore exclude this use of a vert (green) trimount. Instead, there is a trimount vert used in violation of the rule. However, it has been argued by some that the mount vert or trimount issues from the base of the shield rather than being a charge on it, causing the rule not to apply. Fimbriation, the surrounding of a charge by a thin border, can obviate what would otherwise be a violation of the rule, as in the Union Jack (which, although a flag rather than a shield, was designed using heraldic principles). The divise, a thin band running underneath the chief in French heraldry, can also obviate a violation, as can the parallel fillet in English heraldry. Violations \\"Argent a Cross potent between four plain Crosslets Or\\" violates the rule of tincture by featuring metal on metal This rule is so closely followed that arms that violate it are called armes fausses (false arms) or armes √† enqu√©rir (arms of enquiry); any violation is presumed to be intentional, to invite the viewer to ask how it came to pass. =Metal on metal= One of the most famous armes √† enqu√©rir (often erroneously said to be the only example) was the Jerusalem cross said to have been chosen by Godfrey of BouillonWoodcock, p. 7. in 1099 (pre-heraldic and thus strictly speaking attributed arms) and later used by his brother Baldwin of Boulogne when he was made King of Jerusalem. These attributed arms of \\"Argent, a cross potent between four plain crosslets or\\", displayed five gold crosses on a silver field. A use of metal on metal is also seen on the Bishop's mitre in the arms of Andorra and in the arms of the county of Tr√∏ndelag in Norway, based on the arms of St. Olav as described in the Sagas of Snorri. It may indicate the exceptional holy and special status of this particular coat of arms. =Colour on colour= Arms of Le Viste: Gules, on a bend azure three crescents argent, tapestry of The Lady and the Unicorn (Paris, c.1500)Mus√©e national du Moyen √Çge (former Mus√©e de Cluny), Paris Denys of Siston, Gloucestershire (14th-18th c.): Gules, three leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailed of the third. The bend is a \\"colour on colour\\" and thus contravenes the rule of tincture An example of \\"colour on colour\\" is the arms of Albania, with its two-headed eagle sable on a field gules. However, some writers in Central and Eastern European heraldry consider sable to have properties of both a metal and a colour,William Dwight Whitney & Benjamin Eli Smith (eds.) The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, revised ed., volume IX (New York: The Century Co.) page 6345. not exclusively a colour as it is in Western Europe, so that black-on-colour combinations are not uncommon. This rule is perhaps most often violated by a chief, leading some commentators to question whether the rule should apply to a chief, or even whether a chief should be considered a charge at all rather than a division of the field. These violations usually occur in the case of landscape heraldry and augmentations. French civic heraldry, with its frequent chiefs of France (i.e. \\"Azure, three fleurs-de-lys or\\", anciently \\"Azure, sem√©e-de-lys or\\"), often violates this rule when the field is of a colour. The coat of arms appearing on the famous tapestry of The Lady and the Unicorn (Paris, c.1500)Mus√©e national du Moyen √Çge (former Mus√©e de Cluny), Paris was attributed until now by specialistes to the older branch and to the chief of the family Le Viste, Jean IV Le Viste, but it blatantly breaks the rules of French Heraldry. A new study of the tapestry suggests the probability of the intervention of a descendant of the younger branch, Antoine II Le Viste, as a sponsor of the tapestry, and indicates that the incorrect superposition of colours could have been a mere difference.Carmen Decu Teodorescu, \\"La tenture de la Dame √† la licorne : nouvelle lecture des armoiries\\", in Bulletin Monumental n¬∞ 168-4, 2010, pp. 355-367, Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise d'Arch√©ologie. While underscoring the weakness of the arguments in favour of the name Jean IV Le Viste, a new reading of the documentary sources appears to lend credence to Decu Teodorescu's hypothesis in favour of Antoine II Le Viste as a sponsor of the Lady and the Unicorn An example of a contravention from medieval England quoted by John Gibbon in 1682 is the arms of Denys of Siston, Gloucestershire, \\"Gules, three leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailed of the third\\".John Gibbon in 1682 in his Introductio ad Latinam Blasoniam, pp.150-1, of \\"No colour on colour, no metal on metal\\". He quotes the Denys blason saying \\"Now for my reader's diversion & delight I will insert what hath fallen under my observation\\". A modern contravention of the rule is in the arms of Harvard Law School, \\"Azure, a chief gules\\". =Cousu= In French heraldry, the term cousu (\\"sewn\\") is sometimes in blazon used to get around what would otherwise be a violation of the rule; though this is used generally, occasionally a distinction is drawn between the cousu of colour on colour and the soud√© (\\"soldered\\") of metal on metal, though this has fallen from fashion to a large degree. In Italian heraldry terms such as per inchiesta are used in the blazons of the extremely rare violations of the rule, to acknowledge their exceptionality or impropriety.

It has been applied to the design of flags, so that the flag of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was modified to conform to the rule. Pragmatically, it is a useful rule of thumb for the design of logos, icons and other symbols. References Sources * Balfour Paul, James (1893).

In 2005, on his first trip to Bali, Rush was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar with of heroin concealed on his body. After a criminal trial, on 13 February 2006, Rush was sentenced to life imprisonment. After appealing against the severity of the sentence, in a surprise outcome handed down by the Bali High Court on 6 September 2006, Rush's sentence was changed to the death penalty. On 10 May 2011, Rush's death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment on appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court. Early life Rush grew up in Chelmer, a western riverside suburb of Brisbane. Following his arrest, conviction and sentencing, it was revealed that Rush had been expelled from Brisbane's St Laurence's College during his Year 10 studies for an incident involving drugs. It was reported that Rush then moved to another Brisbane school, Marist College Rosalie, whence he graduated in 2002. Media reports claim that Rush was using cannabis at the age of 15 and has used ecstasy and prescription drugs. Further information released following his sentencing, state that in December 2004 Rush pleaded guilty at Inala Magistrates' Court to 16 offences, including drug possession, fraud, theft and drink-driving. A warrant for his arrest in Australia was outstanding at the time of his trip to Bali, relating to A$4,796.95 stolen from an Australian bank. Alleged trafficking conspiracy According to media reports, Rush and his Brisbane friend, Michael Czugaj, met Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen in a Fortitude Valley hotel. Nguyen offered them both a free holiday to Bali, with one media report also stating that Rush was provided a mobile phone prior to his departure from Sydney. Rush, aged 19, and Czugaj, aged 18, arrived in Bali on 8 April 2005 and checked into Hotel Aneka, the same hotel used by Indonesian police for their surveillance. According to claims made in his defence by Rush's lawyer, Nguyen introduced both Rush and Czugaj to alleged co- ringleaders of the smuggling operation, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran at the Hard Rock Hotel in Bali. Allegedly, Chan and Sukumaran threatened both Rush and Czugaj, ordering them to carry concealed goods, or that their families would be killed. =Arrest in Indonesia= Rush was arrested by Indonesian police on 17 April 2005 at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Heroin weighing was discovered strapped to his legs concealed underneath his clothing. Czugaj, Renae Lawrence and Martin Stephens were arrested at the same time as Rush. On 20 April 2005, graphic footage of the arrests and subsequent police questioning of Rush and other members of the Bali Nine was aired on Australian television. On the same day that Rush was arrested, Indonesian police also arrested Si Yi Chen, Nguyen, Sukumaran and Matthew Norman at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Alleged co-ringleader, Andrew Chan was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. =Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff= Lee Rush, Scott Rush's father, said that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) were contacted, on behalf of Rush senior, prior to Rush's departure from Australia and before the commission of the offence. Rush senior feared that his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney- General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. In an interview aired on 13 February 2006 on ABC TV program, Australian Story, Rush's parents spoke out against the Australian Federal Police actions. Criminal trial Criminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen, and Norman were tried together, with Czugaj being one of the remaining six defendants tried separately. When asked why he chose to travel to Bali on a paid holiday, Rush replied \\"Basically that he (Nguyen) didn't have anyone to come to Bali with him.\\" Nguyen refused to testify. Rush also claimed that when he met Chan, threats were made against his family: Czugaj confirmed Rush's account of events as being true. Czugaj testified that he and Rush had never met Lawrence or Stephens, both since convicted and of New South Wales, until they were all arrested together at Ngurah Rai Airport. Rush told the court Chan told him: Chan protested his innocence, saying before the court, \\"A lot of lies have been set against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\\" During court proceedings, Rush initially refused to handle strapping material admitted as evidence, saying \\"No, no\\", before agreeing to handle the evidence after being urged to by the judge. =Sentencing and appeal= During his final plea to judges, Rush said: On 13 February 2006 Rush was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Denpasar District Court. Family friend Neil Urquhart was quoted in response to the life sentence imposed on Rush: On appeal on 6 September 2006, the Bali High Court imposed the death penalty in what many considered a surprising outcome for Rush. On 10 May 2011, a judicial review of Rush's sentence via appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court resulted in a reduction of his sentence to life imprisonment. Since then he has continued to serve his sentence in an Indonesian prison. Prison life Serving his imprisonment in Indonesia, Rush receives A$125 per month under a prisoner loan scheme from the Australian Federal Government. On 7 May 2010, Rush was circumcised in the musholla of Kerobokan prison by an unauthorised visitor, without the prior knowledge or consent of the prison's doctors, in Rush's alleged effort to convert to Islam. Rush has since maintained that he is a Christian and that he underwent the circumcision for \\"health reasons,\\" despite the prison being equipped for such surgery. Media reports claimed Rush's actions were symptoms of death row phenomenon. In May 2011, there were media reports that Rush planned to marry his American girlfriend, Karen Hermiz. In mid 2014, he planned to marry a London banker who he met briefly before his arrest, Nikki Butler. After initially serving time in the Kerobokan Prison, in 2014 Rush was transferred, at his request, to a prison in Karangasem, East Bali, in order to improve himself.

Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Padukone as \\"breathtaking\\", and writing for Deccan Chronicle, Khalid Mohamed concluded that \\"it's Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to.

It is often referred to as the \\"Fastest Circuit in the UK\\" where drivers can reach speeds of over and has earnt the reputation of being a true driver's track. To illustrate this, Damon Hill drove his Williams Formula One car around the circuit at an average speed of 147 mph in 1993. The site also houses the headquarters of the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC).  History  The site was originally constructed in 1942 as RAF Thruxton, a World War II airfield which was home to both the RAF and USAAF and was used for troop-carrying aircraft and gliders, including operations during the D-Day landings. Also, the paratroopers who took part in the successful Bruneval Raid (Operation Biting), in which German radar equipment was seized on the coast of France, took off from here. The circuit, which follows the line of the airfield's perimeter road, was established in 1968. From 1950‚Äì1965, motorbike races had taken place on the runways and perimeter road. Motorsport activities Racing at Thruxton Owing to planning restrictions, the circuit can only run 12 days of motorsport each year. Currently, three are devoted to motorbike racing, with a weekend dedicated to the British Superbike Championship, Britain's premier motorcycle racing category; with the third day being used for club racing. Reema Juffali in her F4 car at Thruxton in April 2019 The remaining days are devoted to car racing with weekends being used for the TOCA British Touring Car Championship, the British Formula 3 and British GT package and the Dunlop Great and British Festival, which features rounds of the British Truck Racing Championship, the International Truck Racing Challenge as well as the staples of the festival, including the Radical endurance races. Two separate one day meetings are run for amateur championships of the BARC, one of which is titled the Thruxton Classic, which features races for Classic Touring Cars, Classic Formula Ford 1600 and Formula Ford 2000. The remaining day is allocated to other organising clubs, such as the 750 Motor Club and Historic Sports Car Club. Owing to the relative infrequency of race meetings, Thruxton continues to be a popular part of the motorsport calendar. Medical and safety services Thruxton has a medical centre in line with Motor Sports Association standards. The MSA circuit licence requires a minimum of two doctors and two rescue units for a race meeting. Most meetings are operated with three rescue units plus a medical car, along with ambulances and first aiders. Points of interest During race weekends, a radio commentary service called Radio Thruxton operates in the medium wave band on 1602 kHz. This has commentators at key points of the track as well as a pit reporter, who conducts interviews with the race winners. Outside of motor racing, the circuit offers a driving school for aspiring racing drivers. It has featured as the venue for BBC3's 2005 series Stars in Fast Cars. The \\"Thruxton\\" heritage As a result of its racing associations, the name \\"Thruxton\\" has been used for: *Triumph Thruxton, a series of caf√© racer motorcycles *Velocette Thruxton, a sport motorcycle *Thruxton handlebars, a type of motorcycle handlebar that is shaped to provide a clip-on-type handlebar position, but which clamps on top of the yoke rather than onto the fork stanchions. Thruxton handlebars are also known as \\"Ace 'bars\\" or \\"Clubman 'bars\\". Thruxton Hospitality Centre The Thruxton Hospitality Centre was opened in June 2018 by Nigel Mansell and Murray Walker. The ¬£2million flagship building is the latest addition to the circuit, forming part of the track's modernisation project. The new building is a 1415m¬≤ facility with more than ten conference and function rooms as well as hospitality suites, a restaurant and bar, an exhibition space and catering facilities. A first floor terrace and balcony provides a view of the first- corner and across the venue.

It was earlier thought to be widespread but studies in 2016 resulted in the splitting of the group into several species placed in two genera.http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/3e07ce7a0a2f06109ecbe3b8cf04d15d The genus Sitana has an enlarged projecting scale on the posterior side of the hind thigh which is absent in the sister genus Sarada. The species is found mostly on the ground in open ground patches in thin forests. When disturbed this lizard sometimes runs with a bipedal gait. Descriptions in Hyderabad, India Upper head-scales small, sharply keeled; canthus rostralis and supraciliary edge sharp, with much enlarged scales. Dorsal scales larger than ventrals, with sharp keels forming straight longitudinal lines; lateral scales smallest, uniform or intermixed with scattered enlarged ones. The fore limb does not extend on to the vent, if laid backwards; the hind limb reaches to the orbit, if laid forwards; the lower thigh is rather shorter than the foot (measured from the heel to the tip of the longest toe), the length of which is only three-fourths of the distance between the shoulder and hip joints. Limbs above with uniform strongly keeled scales. The length of the limbs varies very much : in some specimens the hind limb stretched forwards does not extend beyond the orbit, in others it reaches the end of the snout or even considerably beyond.

The website feeds The Gazette daily newspaper and the Sunday Sun, England‚Äôs best-selling regional Sunday newspaper. Formerly known as Teesside Gazette, the website, mobile app and social media accounts changed to TeessideLive on 5 June 2018. The Gazette is the most popular daily newspaper in Teesside, and has been an integral part of life in the area since 1869, when it was founded as the North-Eastern Daily Gazette by the Scot, and eventual Liberal Member of Parliament for Aston Manor, Hugh Gilzean Reid. It was also at this time, that a first premises were established on Zetland Road, Middlesbrough. Historical copies of the Daily Gazette, dating back to 1870, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive.Digitised copies of the Daily Gazette Later The Gazette Media Company Ltd who also publish the free Herald & Post newspaper. The Teesside Gazette occupied the Gazette building on Borough Road in the centre of Middlesbrough for almost 80 years; and in April 2018, it moved to a new premises on Hudson Quays, Middlehaven. This houses the editorial staff as well as various operational departments such as advertising and newspaper sales. There is a further Gazette Media Company site on the Riverside Industrial Estate which houses a printing press. Teesside Gazette changed the title of its cover page from \\"Evening Gazette\\" to \\"The Gazette\\" in 2014 after the company began releasing the newspaper to newsagents on mornings instead of evenings as it had done previously. It mainly provides local news, but also covers national, international and sports news as well as having various supplements relating to lifestyle, business, and events. \\"The Pink\\" Many local newspapers in the mid-20th century produced a special sports edition on Saturday evening. Before football results were widely available on television and radio such editions were the source of results for players of the football pools. Serious players needed the results as soon as possible since, on afternoons where there were relatively few matches ending in a draw, the payouts from the pools would be large and claims would have to be made quickly, typically by telegram. While the regular evening edition typically \\"went to bed\\" in mid-afternoon, if not earlier, the sports edition had to be on news stands as soon as possible after the conclusion of football games across the country. Most games started at 3 p.m. and concluded around 4:45 p.m. The sports edition was usually available by 6 p.m. It was popular with newsagents who capitalized on the rush of customers its appearance generated to sell cigarettes and other \\"impulse buys\\". The edition was small compared to the regular edition, often as few as three broadsheets, making twelve pages when folded. Plenty of space was devoted to advertising, as well as lists of results and short descriptions of games. In the 1960s The Gazette began printing the sports edition on pink newsprint. Soon the edition began to be known as \\"the Pink\\". To encourage people to buy the sports edition at a time when television was affecting its sales, competitions were run \\"In the Pink\\" with cash prizes. In a similar vein, a sports newspaper published in Sheffield is known as the \\"Green 'Un\\" for the green newsprint used.

The species is found in patches across the Thar desert, Kutch, and surrounding arid zones in India and Pakistan. This species is mainly herbivorous and lives in numbers in some areas. Since it is found in loose clusters it often attracts predators such as raptors. It is also hunted by local peoples in the belief that the fat extracted from it is an aphrodisiac. Taxonomy and etymology Traditionally the species S. hardwickii was placed in the genus Uromastyx, but in 2009 it was moved to the genus Saara together with the closely related species S. asmussi and S. loricata.Wilms TM, B√∂hme W, Wagner P, Lutzmann N, Schmitz A (2009). \\"On the phylogeny and taxonomy of the genus Uromastyx Merrem, 1820 (Reptilia: Squamata: Agamidae: Uromastycinae) ‚Äì resurrection of the genus Saara Gray, 1845\\". Bonner zoologische Beitr√§ge 56 (1/2): 55‚Äì99. The specific name, hardwickii, commemorates English naturalist Thomas Hardwicke who brought illustrations of the species from which J.E. Gray described it.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Uromastyx hardwickii, p. 116). It has been suggested that Uromastyx sensu lato along with the sister group of Leiolepis may be considered as a distinct family, the Uromastycidae, however this is not widely accepted as the rest of the Agamidae do not form a clear sister group. Geographic range The type locality for S. hardwickii is Kanauj district in Uttar Pradesh. It inhabits the dry desert tracts of the northern half of the plains of India into Pakistan. It ranges from Uttar Pradesh in the east to Rajasthan in the West and the Kachchh area of Gujarat. The hot Thar desert is the stronghold of this species and are found extensively in the Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Barmer and Churu districts in Rajasthan. It is also found in some parts of Madhya Pradesh (Rewa). =Local names= *Urdu: sanda *Hindko: sap- slinda *Punjabi: sana *Gujarati: sandho *Rajasthani: sanda *Konkani: gaar Description A juvenile spiny-tailed lizard. Hardwicke's spiny-tailed lizard has a rounded head with a flat snout. It is usually yellowish brown, sandy or olive in colour. It may have black spots and vermiculations and a distinctive black spot on the front of the thigh. It has a dorso-ventrally flattened body with wrinkled skin. Its tail has whorls of spiny scales with large spines on the side. The tail is bluish-grey (in Jaisalmer) to sand- coloured (in Kutch). The colour of the lizard varies and darker colours are seen during the colder seasons. =Sexual dimorphism= Males of S. hardwickii range in total length (including tail) from , and females . The male has a longer tail than the female and pronounced femoral pores.

File:Saara hardwickii medicine.jpgHawker selling sanda oil in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Habits Generally found in firm ground rather than pure sand dunes, Hardwicke's spiny-tailed lizard is often found living in colonies, sometimes on the outskirts of villages. It prefers elevated patches of land especially in Kutch where it is invariably found on isolated patches of high ground (called Bets) above the monsoon water level. Also found in Sindh at Kohistan area surrounding Karachi and Thana Bula Khan. Birds of prey are a major predator of the lizard in the desert. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been recorded in literature but the tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) and other falcons such as the laggar (Falco jugger) also prey on these lizards. The cattle egret has also been known to prey on it. =Burrow= Hardwicke's spiny-tailed lizard excavates a sloping zig-zagging or spiralling tunnel of diameter and over long for itself. The tunnel has an entrance which is flush with the ground and ends in a small chamber. S. hardwickii is solitary in the burrow, but hatchlings may stay with the mother initially. The lizard basks close to the entrance of its burrow. It is very alert and smoothly slides into its burrow at the first hint of danger. The spiny-tailed hibernates through the winter and emerges in spring. By the time it is ready for hibernation, the lizard puts on long strips of fat on each side of the backbone which presumably enables it to survive the long winter months. Projected agricultural growth would cause considerable declines of Hardwicke's spiny- tailed lizard (>20%) populations. =Food= Hardwicke's spiny-tailed lizard is largely herbivorous and its teeth are adapted for a plant diet which comprises the flowers and fruits of the kair (Capparis aphylla); the beans of khejri (Prosopis spicigera); the fruit of Salvadora persica, and grass. In locust-breeding areas the spiny tailed lizard has been known to feed on nymphs and adults of the locust. In summer it tends to forage more in the mornings feeding to a greater extent on insects, and in the monsoons it feeds principally on herbs and grasses. Breeding biology Hardwicke's spiny- tailed lizard breeds in spring after emerging from hibernation. It lays white, pigeon-sized eggs. Economic importance In India S. hardwickii is caught for its meat, about which Malcolm Smith says \\"... with certain castes of Hindus it is a regular article of diet ... the meat is said to be excellent and white like chicken ... the head and feet are not eaten, but the tail is considered a great delicacy ... the fat of the body is boiled down and the resulting oil is used as an embrocation and also as a cure for impotence.\\"Smith MA (1935). pp. 244-247. The fat stored in the tail of the lizard is purported to have medicinal properties and for this reason, this lizard is often illegally collected and sold in various parts of India and Pakistan for folk medicine. It is kept in captivity by the cruel practice of dislocating the backbone. Poaching Hardwicke's spiny-tailed lizard is on the verge of extinction in western Rajasthan due to rampant poaching by nomads, who value this reptile both for its meat and as a medicine. During the monsoon, this lizard leaves its burrow and comes out to feed on tender shoots of grass, at which time it falls prey to raptors.Dey, Anindo (2009). Times of India, Delhi, 13 June 2009.

Biography  Lourdes Portillo receiving an award in Spain in 2015. She is a writer, director, and producer of films from television documentary to satirical video-film collage. Portillo got her first filmmaking experience at the age of twenty-one when a friend in Hollywood asked her to help out on a documentary. Her formal training began several years later. She has thus been making award-winning films about Latin American, Mexican, and Chicano/a experiences and social justice issues both as a director and screenwriter for about forty years. Since her first film in 1979, After the Earthquake/ Despues del Terremoto, she has produced over 12 works that demonstrate her work as not only a director, but also an activist, artist, and journalist. While the majority of her work is in the documentary film genre, she has also created video installations and screen writings. Her films have been widely studied and analyzed, particularly by scholars in the field of Chicano studies. She is a member of the production team of Xochitl Productions, which seeks to \\"inform the general population through varied endeavors that challenge dominant narratives.\\" Personal life Portillo was born in Mexico and raised in Los Angeles, California. She was first exposed to documentary filmmaking while working for an educational film company in Los Angeles. She apprenticed with the National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians in San Francisco, and graduated with an MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1985. Afterward, she began her career as a producer and director of films. The political perspectives of her films have been described as \\"nuanced\\" and versed with a point of view balanced by her experience as a lesbian and Chicana woman. Career Portillo's films generally focus on Latin America and the experience of Latin American-born immigrants in the United States. Her film debut, the 1979 Despu√©s del Terremoto, focuses on the experience of a Nicaraguan refugee of the 1972 Managua earthquake in San Francisco. It was followed by The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, a 1986 co-production with the Argentine director Susana Blaustein Mu√±oz which documented the actions of Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group of Argentine women who gather weekly at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires to remember their children that were murdered or \\"disappeared\\" by the military regime. Las Madres received an Academy Award nomination in 1987 for Best Documentary. Other films have included Day of the Dead celebrations, Selena, the Female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez, and AIDS (short film Sometimes My Feet Go Numb). She has completed numerous collaborations such as with the Chicano comedy troupe Culture Clash on two productions: Columbus on Trial and Culture Clash: Mission Magic Mystery Tour. She has also collaborated with the San Francisco Mime Troupe. Portillo's work is influenced by radical cinema. Portillo and many artists of radical cinema focus on the combination of art and politics. These artists approach politics in art, but don't want art to suffer for its inclusion‚Äîthey strive for a balance of the political and the artistic in their expression. Portillo‚Äôs sixteen completed films include the Academy Award and Emmy Award nominated The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo (1986), La Ofrenda: The Days of the Dead (1988), Columbus on Trial (1992), The Devil Never Sleeps (1994), Corpus: A Home Movie for Selena (1999), My McQueen (2004), Al M√°s All√° (2008), and her first animated film, State of Grace (2013). Her celebrated feature-length film, Se√±orita Extraviada (2001), a documentary about the disappearance and death of young women in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, received a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Best Documentary at the Havana International Film Festival, the Nestor Almendros Award at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival, and the Ariel, the Mexican Academy of Film Award.

Remire-Montjoly is a suburb of Cayenne, the capital pr√©fecture and largest city of French Guiana. It is located to the south-east of Cayenne. Residential districts are located along some of the best beaches in the Cayenne area. Cayenne and French Guiana's main seaport, the port of D√©grad des Cannes, is located in the commune of Remire-Montjoly, on the estuary of the Mahury River. Almost all of French Guiana's imports and exports pass through the port of D√©grad des Cannes. History The name of the town Remire, formerly Armire, is of Galibi origin. The town was founded in October 1652 by missionaires. In 1656, Dutch Jews who had fled from Pernambuco, Brazil settled in Remire and built a sugar factory. Most of them left for Suriname when the French retook the area. In 1666, the Jesuits settled in the town, and started a sugar plantation. In 1765, the possessions of the Jesuits were ceased, and Remira became a tiny village in the shadow of Cayenne once more. In 1879, Remire was elevated to a community with its own mayor. After the eruption of Mount Pel√©e in 1902, many people from Martinique settled in the town. The commune was originally called Remire, but on 27 March 1969 the name was officially changed to Remire-Montjoly to reflect the development of Montjoly, one of the two settlements located within the commune. With urban expansion, the settlements of Remire and Montjoly have fused with Cayenne into a single urban area, however Remire-Montjoly remains a commune that is administered separately from the commune of Cayenne.

Found at Tavanandi forest, Karnataka, India. Sallekhana (IAST: ), also known as samlehna, santhara, samadhi-marana or sanyasana- marana, is a supplementary vow to the ethical code of conduct of Jainism. It is the religious practice of voluntarily fasting to death by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids. It is viewed in Jainism as the thinning of human passions and the body, and another means of destroying rebirth-influencing karma by withdrawing all physical and mental activities. It is not considered as a suicide by Jain scholars because it is not an act of passion, nor does it deploy poisons or weapons. After the sallekhana vow, the ritual preparation and practice can extend into years. Sallekhana is a vow available to both for Jain ascetics and householders. Historic evidence such as nishidhi engravings suggest sallekhana was observed by both men and women, including queens, in Jain history. However, in the modern era, death through sallekhana has been a relatively uncommon event. There is debate about the practice from a right to life and a freedom of religion viewpoint. In 2015, the Rajasthan High Court banned the practice, considering it suicide. Later that year, the Supreme Court of India stayed the decision of the Rajasthan High Court and lifted the ban on sallekhana. Vow There are Five Great vows prescribed to followers of Jainism; Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (not lying), Asteya (not stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non- possession). A further seven supplementary vows are also prescribed, which include three Gunavratas (merit vows) and four Shiksha vratas (disciplinary vows). The three Gunavratas are: Digvrata (limited movements, limiting one's area of activity), Bhogopabhogaparimana (limiting use of consumable and non- consumable things), and Anartha-dandaviramana (abstain from purposeless sins). The Shikshavratas include: Samayika (vow to meditate and concentrate for limited periods), Desavrata (limiting movement and space of activity for limited periods), ProsadhopavƒÅsa (fasting for limited periods), and Atithi- samvibhag (offering food to the ascetic).Pravin K. Shah, Twelve Vows of Layperson , Jainism Literature Center, Harvard University Sallekhana is treated as a supplementary to these twelve vows. However, some Jain teachers such as Kundakunda, Devasena, Padmanandin, and Vasunandin have included it under Shikshavratas. Sallekhana () means to properly 'thin out', 'scour out' or 'slender' the passions and the body through gradually abstaining from food and drink. Sallekhana is divided into two components: Kashaya Sallekhana (slendering of passions) or Abhayantra Sallekhana (internal slendering) and Kaya Sallekhana (slendering the body) or Bahya Sallekhana (external slendering). It is described as \\"facing death voluntarily through fasting\\". According to Jain texts, Sallekhana leads to Ahimsa (non-violence or non- injury), as a person observing Sallekhana subjugates the passions, which are the root cause of Himsa (injury or violence). Conditions Sallekhana as expounded in the Jain text, Ratnakaranda ≈õrƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅra While Sallekhana is prescribed for both householders and ascetics, Jain texts describe conditions when it is appropriate. It should not be observed by a householder without guidance of a Jain ascetic. Sallekhana is always voluntary, undertaken after public declaration, and never assisted with any chemicals or tools. The fasting causes thinning away of body by withdrawing by choice food and water to oneself. As death is imminent, the individual stops all food and water, with full knowledge of colleagues and spiritual counsellor. In some cases, Jains with terminal illness undertake sallekhana, and in these cases they ask for permission from their spiritual counsellor. For a successful sallekhana, the death must be with \\"pure means\\", voluntary, planned, undertaken with calmness, peace and joy where the person accepts to scour out the body and focuses his or her mind on spiritual matters. Sallekhana differs from other forms of ritual deaths recognized in Jainism as appropriate. The other situations consider ritual death to be better for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (Mahavrata). For example, celibacy is one of the Five vows, and ritual death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be defamed. A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth. Procedure The duration of the practice can vary from a few days to years. The sixth part of the Ratnakaranda ≈õrƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅra describes Sallekhana and its procedure as follows‚Äî Jain texts mention five transgressions (Atichara) of the vow: the desire to be reborn as a human, the desire to be reborn as a divinity, the desire to continue living, the desire to die quickly, and the desire to live a sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future. The ancient Svetambara Jain text Acharanga Sutra, dated to about 3rd or 2nd century BCE, describes three forms of Sallekhana: the Bhaktapratyakhyana, the Ingita-marana, and the Padapopagamana. In Bhaktapratyakhyana, the person who wants to observe the vow selects an isolated place where he lies on a bed made of straw, does not move his limbs, and avoids food and drink until he dies. In Ingita-marana, the person sleeps on bare ground. He can sit, stand, walk, or move, but avoids food until he dies. In Padapopagamana, a person stands \\"like a tree\\" without food and drink until he dies. Another variation of Sallekhana is Itvara which consists of voluntarily restricting oneself in a limited space and then fasting to death. History An inscription (No.130) in memory of Vinayadevasena who observed Sallekhana. 7th century Kannada script. Found at Shravanbelgola, Karnataka, India. Doddahundi nishidhi inscription was raised in honor of Western Ganga King Nitimarga I in 869 CE who observed Sallekhana. Udayagiri hills, Odisha, India =Textual= The Acharanga Sutra () describes three forms of the practice. Early Svetambara text Shravakaprajnapti notes that the practice is not limited to ascetics. The Bhagavati S≈´tra (2.1) also describes Sallekhana in great detail, as it was observed by Skanda Katyayana, an ascetic of Mahavira. The 4th century text Ratnakaranda ≈õrƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅra, and the Svetambara text Nava-pada-prakarana, also provide detailed descriptions. The Nava-pada- prakarana mentions seventeen methods of \\"voluntarily chosen death\\", of which it approves only three as consistent with the teachings of Jainism. The practice is also mentioned in the 2nd century CE Sangam era poem Sirupanchamoolam. The Panchashaka makes only a cursory mention of the practice and it is not described in Dharmabindu ‚Äì both texts by Haribhadra (). In the 9th century text \\"ƒÄdi purƒÅ·πáa\\" by Jinasena the three forms are described. Yashastilaka by Somadeva (10th century) also describes the practice. Other writers like Vaddaradhane (10th century) and Lalitaghate also describe the Padapopagamana, one of its forms. Hemchandra () describes it in a short passage despite his detailed coverage of the observances of householders (Shravakachara). According to Tattvartha Sutra, \\"a householder willingly or voluntary adopts Sallekhana when death is very near.\\" According to the medieval era Jain text, Puru≈üƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya, both the ascetics and the householder should \\"court voluntarily death at the end of life\\", thinking that only sallekhana is a pious death. The Silappadikaram (Epic of the Anklet) by the Jain prince-turned-monk, Ilango Adigal, mentions Sallekhana by the Jain nun, Kaundi Adigal. =Archeological= In South India, especially Karnataka, a memorial stone or footprint is erected to commemorate the death of person who observed Sallekhana. This is known as Nishidhi, Nishidige or Nishadiga. The term is derived from the Sanskrit root Sid or Sad which means \\"to attain\\" or \\"waste away\\". These Nishidhis detail the names, dates, the duration of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple. In Shravanabelgola in Karnataka, ninety-three Nishidhis are found ranging from circa 6th century to the 19th century. Fifty-four of them belong to the period circa 6th to the 8th century. It is believed that a large number of Nishidhis at Shravanabelgola follow the earlier tradition. Several inscriptions after 600 CE record that Chandragupta Maurya () and his teacher Bhadrabahu observed the vow atop Chandragiri Hill at Sharavnabelagola. Historians such as R. K. Mookerji consider the accounts unproven, but plausible. An undated inscription in old Kannada script is found on the Nishidhi from Doddahundi near Tirumakudalu Narasipura in Karnataka. Historians such as J. F. Fleet, I. K. Sarma, and E.P. Rice have dated it to 840 or 869 CE by its textual context. The memorial stone has a unique depiction in frieze of the ritual death (Sallekhana) of King Ereganga Nitimarga I () of the Western Ganga Dynasty. It was raised by the king's son Satyavakya. In Shravanabelgola, the Kuge Brahmadeva pillar has a Nishidhi commemorating Marasimha, another Western Ganga king. An inscription on the pillar in front of Gandhavarna Basadi commemorates Indraraja, the grandson of the Rashtrakuta King Krishna III, who died in 982 after observing the vow. The inscriptions in South India suggest sallekhana was originally an ascetic practice which later extended to Jain householders. Its importance as an ideal death in the spiritual life of householders ceased by about the 12th century. The practice was revived in 1955 by the Digambara monk Acharya Santisagara. =Modern= Sallekhana is a respected practice in the Jain community. It has not been a \\"practical or general goal\\" among Svetambara Jains for many years. It was revived among Digambara monks. In 1955, Acharya Shantisagar, a Digambara monk took the vow because of his inability to walk without help and his weak eye-sight. In 1999, Acharya Vidyanand, another Digambara monk, took a twelve-year-long vow. Between 1800 and 1992, at least 37 instances of Sallekhana are recorded in Jain literature. There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, an average of about 240 Jains practice Sallekhana each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed. Statistically, Sallekhana is undertaken both by men and women of all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. It is observed more often by women than men.  Legality and comparison with suicide  Jain texts make a clear distinction between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions. The comparison of Sallekhana with suicide is debated since the early time of Jainism. The early Buddhist Tamil epic Kundalakesi compared it to suicide. It is refuted in the contemporary Tamil Jain literature such as in Neelakesi. Professor S. A. Jain cites differences between the motivations behind suicide and those behind Sallekhana to distinguish them: Champat Rai Jain, a Jainist scholar wrote in 1934: Modern era Indian activists have questioned this rationale, calling the voluntary choice of death as an evil similar to sati, and have attempted to legislate and judicially act against this religious custom. Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950, guarantees the right to life to all persons within the territory of India and its states. In Gian Kaur vs The State Of Punjab, the state high court ruled, \\"... 'right to life' is a natural right embodied in Article 21 but suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of right to life\\". Nikhil Soni vs Union of India (2006), a case filed in the Rajasthan High Court, citing the Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug vs Union Of India case related to euthanasia, and the Gian Kaur case, argued, \\"No person has a right to take his own life consciously, as the right to life does not include the right to end the life voluntarily.\\" So the petitioner cited Sallekhana as a suicide and thus punishable under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide). The case also extended to those who helped facilitate the deaths of individuals observing Sallekhana, finding they were culpable under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) with aiding and abetting an act of suicide. It was also argued that Sallekhana \\"serves as a means of coercing widows and elderly relatives into taking their own lives\\". An attempt to commit suicide was a crime under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code. In response, the Jain community argued that prohibiting the practice is a violation of their freedom of religion, a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 15 and Article 25 of the Constitution of India.article 15 of India Constitution The book Sallekhana Is Not Suicide by former Justice T. K. Tukol was widely cited in the court which opined that \\"Sallekhana as propounded in the Jaina scriptures is not suicide.\\" The Rajasthan High Court stated that \\"[The Constitution] does not permit nor include under Article 21 the right to take one's own life, nor can it include the right to take life as an essential religious practice under Article 25 of the Constitution\\". It further added that it is not established that Sallekhana is an essential practise of Jainism and therefore not covered by Article 25 (1). So the High Court banned the practice in August 2015 making it punishable under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 309 (attempt to commit suicide). Members of the Jain community held nationwide protest marches against the ban on Sallekhana. Advocate Suhrith Parthasarathy criticised the judgement of the High Court and wrote, \\"Sallekhana is not an exercise in trying to achieve an unnatural death, but is rather a practice intrinsic to a person's ethical choice to live with dignity until death.\\" He also pointed out that the Supreme Court in the Gian Kaur case explicitly recognises the right to live with human dignity within the ambit of right to life. He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, \\"[The right to life] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the right to die with dignity at the end of life is not to be confused or equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life.\\" On 31 August 2015, the Supreme Court admitted the petition by Akhil Bharat Varshiya Digambar Jain Parishad and granted leave. It stayed the decision of the High Court and lifted the ban on the practice. In April 2017, the Indian parliament decriminalised suicide by passing the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.  In Hinduism and Buddhism  There are similar practices in other religions like Prayopavesa in Hinduism, and Sokushinbutsu in Buddhism. The ancient and medieval scholars of Indian religions discussed suicide, and a person's right to voluntarily choose death. Suicide is broadly disapproved and discouraged by Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts. The Satapatha Brahmana of Hinduism, for example, in section 10.2.6 discusses the nature of cyclic life and rebirth, and concludes that \\"therefore, one should not depart before one's natural lifespan\\", states David Brick, an Indologist at the Yale University. However, for those who have renounced the world (sannyasi, sadhu, yati, bhikshu), the Indian texts discuss when ritual choice of death is appropriate and what means of voluntarily ending one's life are appropriate. The Sannyasa Upanishads, for example, discuss many methods of religious death, such as slowing then stopping consumption of foods and drinks to death (similar to sallekhana), walking into a river and drowning, entering fire, path of the heroes, and the Great Journey. Scholars disagree whether \\"voluntary religious death\\" discussed in Indian religions is same as other forms of suicide.

R. Olsen BSc, DipTch Origins =Proposal= The establishment of a Catholic boarding school for boys in Otago was first proposed 1890. However, it was not until 1925 that the preparations for the establishment began. The Bishop of Dunedin, James Whyte, asked the Christian Brothers to set up the school. They had, from 1876, conducted the Christian Brothers School in Dunedin.Redcastle Recollections, A Golden Jubilee Volume, p. 2. This school had for a time taken boarders in a hostel which operated from 1919 until 1924.O'Neill, p. 78. Various sites were inspected by the Bishop and the Provincial of the Christian Brothers, P. I. Hickey, and the property called \\"Redcastle\\" in Oamaru was chosen as the most suitable site. =Campus= The site of the college was originally developed by the McLean and Buckley families. John McLean was born on the island of Mull, Scotland, in 1818. He (with his brothers) made his fortune in developing and exploiting High Country sheep stations (particularly \\"Morven Hills\\" in the Lindis Pass) and by selling them at the right time.Robert Pinney, Early Northern Otago Runs, Collins, Auckland, 1981, pp. 141‚Äì143. McLean purchased the Oamaru land in 1857 as part of much larger block for about 10/- an acre. Much of it was sold off, but he retained the area which is now the school, and he resided there from the 1860s. By 1871 he was running 10,000 sheep on the property. He was the Oamaru member for the Otago Provincial Council and he was also a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council (1867‚Äì1872). He died in 1902 and the land passed to his nephew, St John McLean Buckley.\\"Buckley, St. John Mclean\\", The Cyclopedia of New Zealand, Otago & Southland Provincial Districts' retrieved 2 September 2014. The original homestead was one-storied with a thatched roof. When the old house burned down, Buckley built the red brick residence with Oamaru stone facing, now known as the \\"Castle\\" and, since he was very fond of horse-racing, he built large stables (a building now named \\"The Stables\\"), St John Buckley died in 1915 and his son, also named John Buckley, sold the property to a syndicate of local people. The property was called \\"Redcastle\\".O'Neill, pp. 79, 81.\\"St Kevin's College: A Brief History\\" ; retrieved 1 September 2014. Redcastle was known for its beauty and its sporting associations (particularly those of St John McLean Buckley ‚Äì He was, apart from his horse racing interests, president of cycling, coursing, gymnastic and tennis clubs). The homestead (the \\"castle\\") was (and is) a significant country house. The property comprising was purchased by the Christian Brothers at a cost of ¬£8000 in 1925 and a further were added, at a cost of ¬£1000, in 1928. The present campus thus has an area of 27 hectares.\\"About St Kevin's College\\"; retrieved 30 August 2014. In May 1926, Brother Moore, who had experience in fund-raising, came to Dunedin to organise a bazaar and lottery to fund the purchase of the land and the establishment of the college. His confrere, Brother Dowd, toured the country districts to collect donations. These initiatives resulted in a fund of ¬£7000. In 1926, the construction of the buildings began under the supervision of Brother Prunster. =Commencement= The College was named after the Irish saint, Kevin (498‚Äì618), the founder of the monastery and school of Glendalough. The blessing and opening of the college took place on Sunday, 6 February 1927. There were several Bishops present: Archbishop Redwood and Bishops O'Shea, Whyte, Cleary, Brodie and Liston. There were many priests and more than 2,500 friends and well-wishers present coming from Dunedin and nearby parts of both Otago and Canterbury. Classes commenced on Tuesday, 8 February 1927. There were 60 boarders and 31 day students. The Christian Brothers on the first staff were Brother Magee (the Rector) and Brothers Bowler, Brennan, Le Breton, Dowd, Ryan, Mills and Maye.O'Neill, p. 84. The Rector of Waitaki Boys' High School, Frank Milner, was present at the opening. When Frank Milner (\\"a firm friend of St Kevin's\\") died in 1944, the St Kevin's Boys formed a guard of honour for his remains as they left the church after the funeral service. O'Neill, pp. 83 and 90. =Ethos= For its first 55 years, St Kevin's College was typical of Christian Brother boarding institutions in Australia and New Zealand. They were designed to provide a Catholic education for the sons of rural Catholic families. For the Christian Brothers they were places of particularly hard work. Individual Brothers taught throughout the day, coached sports teams after school, supervised meals and study, and were responsible for the dormitories at night. The Brothers generally had to be young men with energy.Robertson, p. 40. Notable alumni The College has produced 19 Christian Brothers and 7 Brothers belonging to other Religious Orders, 101 Priests, 1 Bishop, 1 Archbishop (who was also a cardinal).

It is located in Fanahammeren, a village in the borough of Fana in the city of Bergen. It is one of the two churches for the Fana parish which is part of the Fana prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The gray, stone church was built in a long church style in the year 1153 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 450 people. The existing stone building celebrated its 850-year anniversary in 2003, but the church building history is long and complicated. Historians assert that the church has been rebuilt and enlarged several times. History Fana Church was mentioned in writings for the first time in 1228, when Pope Gregory IX released a conscription to the vicar and brothers at \\"the holy cross church and hospital in Fana\\". In the letter, it is mentioned that the bishops in Bergen had let the church be founded again: \\"de novo fundari\\". Parts of the existing church building are from the Romance √©poque, and the walls show signs of there having been a stone building at the site, most likely a church, before 1220. Due to this, it is believed that the core of the church was built in the second half of the 12th century. =Windows= The window painting telling the history of the church. The latest rebuilding of any magnitude was done as late as in 1927‚Äì28, when the window was changed. Window paintings by Bernhard Greve (1886-1962) illustrate the history of the church. *1228: Fana Church is built after the christening of Norway by Saint Olaf. *1228: Conscription from Pope Gregory IX referenced The Holy Cross Church *1537: The silver cross, other treasures and lead row are removed. *1644: The church burns after having been struck by lightning. *1928: The church is re-consecrated after having been rebuilt. =Legend of the holy silver cross= Fana church at night. The legend \\"The Holy Silver Cross\\" is connected to Fana church. In 1626, King Christian IV of Denmark commissioned the University of Copenhagen to register all historical objects and occurrences in Bj√∏rgvin bishopric. Skonvig, the son of a priest, sent a letter about the legend. Two fishermen found a silver cross outside Korsneset along Korsfjorden. They tried to get the cross on land near Milde. However, the cross was too heavy to carry, so they knew the cross was meant for Fana. When they arrived at Fanahammeren, the cross was easy to carry. They brought it to the church where it was settled at the altar. One of the fishermen was blind, but when he touched the cross and scratched his eyes he gained sight again. The story about the healing cross reached many, and pilgrims visited the church hoping to be healed. It is said that at Krykkjehaugen, a small knoll close to the church, there were crutches and canes that pilgrims had left behind after having been healed at the cross. According to the legend, the priest in Fana burned six horse-loads of crutches in 1546. =Ownership= Since Fana Church was rather big compared to other rural churches, some believe that the church was a county church in its early years. It is believed that the hospital next to the church was shut down around 1300. In 1303, Fana Church was one of 14 royal chapels after having been transferred from the Bishop in Bergen to the Apostle Church in Bergen. Fana Church is one of only 3 remaining royal chapels. In 1723, the royal deed was sold to two men from the parish, Nils Olson Austevoll and Vinsens Nilsson Nedre Titlestad. The church was privately held until 1862, when the parish bought it. The parish decided to rebuild the church in 1870‚Äì71. Major changes were done, but after some years it became apparent that rebuilding had been a mistake. In 1920, the architect Frederik Konow Lund (1889‚Äì1970) was hired, who tried to restore the church to the Medieval appearance it once had.

In 2005, Chan was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar. According to court testimonies of convicted drug mules, Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were the co-ringleaders of the heroin smuggling operation from Indonesia to Australia. After a criminal trial on 14 February 2006, Chan was sentenced to execution by firing squad by the Denpasar District Court. After lodging an appeal against his sentence, his appeal was dismissed by the Indonesian Supreme Court on 10 May 2011. His plea for clemency was rejected by the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, on 22 January 2015. The execution was carried out on 29 April 2015.  Early life and education  Chan was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the youngest child of Ken and Helena Chan, both first-generation Cantonese-speaking non-religious immigrants from China. Chan was one of four children, having a brother and two sisters. Chan's mother had limited English language skills, and Chan did not speak Cantonese. Chan's brother Michael translated for him when required. Chan grew up in Enfield in Sydney, and attended Homebush Boys High School. Both he and Myuran Sukumaran attended the same school, but Sukumaran was four school years above Chan, and they did not meet until 2002, at a mutual friend's house. Career Chan was employed at Eurest, a catering company, where he worked as a supervisor. It was reported that Chan had a good reputation at his job and was known to be a punctual and reliable worker. In an interview broadcast on SBS TV's Dateline following his sentencing and appeal, Chan stated: When Chan worked for Eurest, he met Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens and Matthew Norman. All four would later be convicted of drug trafficking as fellow members of the Bali Nine. Media reports claim that in early October 2004, Chan invited Lawrence to the Enfield home of his parents to celebrate Lawrence's 27th birthday; Chan was living with his parents at this time. Here, Chan allegedly told Lawrence that she was to travel with him to Bali, without being told the detail behind the mission. Lawrence claimed that Chan would cover all air flights and accommodation and that if she disobeyed him or disclosed the nature of their arrangement, he would \\"send (her) family to the farm\\". Lawrence claimed that Chan said there would be a reward, should she follow his instructions. It was also reported that she met Myuran Sukumaran around this time. Drug smuggling It was alleged that Chan flew to Bali on 16 October 2004, with Lawrence also arriving in Bali on the same date. Lawrence claimed that Chan was in regular contact with her when she stayed in the Istana Rama Hotel in Kuta, and Chan in Kuta's Hard Rock complex. Media reports stated that Lawrence alleged that on 22 October 2004, Sukumaran strapped packages to the body of both Lawrence and Chan, and with Chan's girlfriend, Grace, boarded a commercial flight to Australia, successfully clearing security, customs and immigration in both Indonesia and Australia. Lawrence claimed that she and Chan were met at the airport, the packages removed, all of them taken to another house, and then Lawrence went home. A few days later Lawrence claimed that Chan handed her an envelope with A$10,000 cash. Lawrence claimed that a similar trip was organised following Chan's orders, where she departed Australia on 5 December 2004. Lawrence claimed that seven others were involved, including Chan, Matthew Norman, and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen (going by the alias of David). Lawrence claimed that she was again given cash to purchase air flights and accommodation for eight days, staying again at the Istana Rama in Kuta. However, the second delivery was aborted when heroin suppliers failed to deliver \\"due to a financial matter or someone knowing about the plan the shipment was cancelled\\". According to Lawrence, again under Chan's instructions, Lawrence departed Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Lawrence, Stephens and Si Yi Chen met with Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling tools such as sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Lawrence and Stephens. Lawrence claims that she was given cash, whereas Stephens claims that his life was threatened. According to media reports, police records show that during his stay in Bali, Chan was in daily contact with Lawrence, until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, Chan instructed Lawrence and other members of the Bali Nine to change hotels. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans. =Arrest= Chan was arrested on 17 April 2005 as he was seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar, Indonesia, for Sydney. He was arrested carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass; however, no drugs were found in his possession. Around the same time as Chan was arrested, Indonesian police arrested four drug mules collectively carrying of heroin concealed on their bodies. Martin Stephens was found to be carrying ; Renae Lawrence was found to be carrying ; Michael Czugaj was found to be carrying and Scott Rush was found to be carrying of heroin. A little later that same day, Indonesian police also arrested Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, Myuran Sukumaran and Matthew Norman at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Indonesian police claim that this latter group were in possession of of heroin and bundles of plastic wrapping, Elastoplast tape, and a set of scales, indicating involvement in a plan to transport drugs to Australia. =Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff= Lee Rush, the father of Scott Rush, a fellow member of the Bali Nine, said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney-General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. =Trial= Criminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen, and Norman, all arrested at the Melasti Hotel and earning the numeric epithet, The Melasti Three, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants, including Chan, tried separately. In December 2005, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment;. Lawyers acting for Stephens, one of the Bali Nine, claimed that the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians should be prepared for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty. Giving evidence against Chan, Lawrence testified that she had received threats of harm against herself and her family if she did not proceed with the plan to import heroin into Australia. She claimed before the Denpasar District Court that Chan ordered her to book a flight to Bali and that she did not know why she was ordered to travel. Another drug mule, Rush, also later convicted of drug trafficking, accused Chan of strapping the heroin to his body while wearing rubber gloves. Throughout his trial, Chan remained silent. During his final plea, reading from a two-page statement, Chan commented: The Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, said that the Australian government would oppose any death sentences imposed, saying: =Sentencing and appeal= In January 2006, prosecutors called for the death penalty to be handed down on Chan, after earlier calls for the same demand against Sukumaran ‚Äì the only two calls of death put forward by prosecutors for any of the Bali Nine. Prosecutors told a Bali court there was no reason to show any leniency because Chan helped organise the heroin smuggling operation. Prosecutors also claim Sukumaran and Chan strapped heroin to the bodies of the fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Chan as one of the main players in what they say was a major smuggling ring. Found guilty of drug trafficking, on 14 February 2006 three judges in the Denpasar District Court sentenced Chan to death by firing squad. In handing down their ruling, they claimed that Chan had not been straightforward in his evidence and had shown no remorse. Commenting on the sentences at the time, AFP Commissioner Keelty said \\"I stand by the police and what they've done ... The Federal Court actually made a decision saying not only had they acted lawfully but they acted in accordance with government policy.\\" Prime Minister Howard said \\"The police are there to protect us from the ravages of drugs and I just hope that every young Australian who might in their wildest imagination think that they can get away with this will take a lesson from this.\\" ...... \\"I feel desperately sorry for the parents of these people. I do. All of us as parents will feel that way, but the warnings have been there for decades.\\" Julian McMahon, a Melbourne human rights lawyer who took over the case in 2006 on a pro-bono basis, appealed against the severity of Chan's sentence to the Indonesian Supreme Court. During the appeal hearings it was revealed that Chan has a girlfriend and that the governor of Kerobokan Prison described Chan and Sukumaran as model prisoners and that Chan and Sukumaran have a positive influence on other prisoners. In his final appeal, Chan said \\"I apologise to the Indonesian people, I also apologise to my family and I realise that my actions have brought shame and suffering to my whole family. If I am pardoned... I hope that one day I will be able to have my own family and work as a pastor so I can give guidance to young people. I can still contribute a great deal during my life. I have lost all my integrity and good will, and brought deep shame and outrageous suffering to my loved ones.\\" On 17 June 2011, it was announced that the Indonesian Supreme Court had rejected Chan's appeal against his death sentence on 10 May 2011. Indonesian President at that time, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, had the power to grant clemency, although media reports considered this unlikely and expected that Chan would be executed. In October 2014, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) succeeded Yudhoyono as President. Jokowi holds a hardline position against drugs. In January 2015 the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott together with the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop made further representations to Jokowi and Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi for clemency in the commutation of Chan's sentence. Chan's plea for clemency was dismissed. In late January lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran filed an application for a judicial review into their cases; which was rejected by the Denpasar District Court a few days later. Meanwhile, Indonesian officials continued planning for the execution of Chan and Sukumaran: Tony Spontana, a spokesperson for Muhammad Prasetyo, the Attorney General of Indonesia, said that \\"The applied norm is that the judicial review doesn't stop the execution process, the convicts have received the president's decree which declines their clemency request.\\" In a final attempt to avert the death penalty, on 9 February, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran launched a rare challenge against the Indonesian president's refusal to grant them pardons; which was dismissed by the Indonesian government a day later. On 11 February 2015, Indonesian authorities approved the transfer of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison, in preparation for execution. =Reaction in Australia= A candlelight vigil hosted by the Mercy Campaign, entitled Music for Mercy, was held in Sydney's Martin Place on the evening of 29 January 2015 in support of Chan and Sukumaran. The concert featured performances by Archibald Prize artist Ben Quilty, singer-songwriter Megan Washington, Josh Pyke, Kate Miller- Heidke, Paul Mac, Glenn Richards from Augie March, and The Presets' Julian Hamilton; with Andrew Denton, his partner, Jennifer Byrne, and Missy Higgins who recorded video messages of support for Chan and Sukumaran. Amnesty International organised similar vigils in Federation Square, , Adelaide, Canberra, and . On 13 February, Australia's foreign minister, Julie Bishop, raised the potential for a boycott of Bali as a tourism destination should the executions proceed. Former high court judge Michael Kirby stated that he expected a decline in tourism was a potential consequence of executing Chan and Sukumaran. Both Bishop and Tanya Plibersek, Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman, made pleas for clemency in the Australian parliament. Quilty and Victorian supreme court judge Lex Lasry visited Chan and Sukumaran in Bali. Prison life Chan married Febyanti Herewila, whom he met when she was visiting another prisoner, on 27 April 2015. The prison governor has described Chan and Sukumaran as model prisoners and testified in court that they should not be executed because of the positive influence they have had. In an interview the governor stated that \\"Chan organises courses in prison, leads the English-language church service and is a mentor to many.\\" Chan became a Christian while in prison and led the English-language Christian church service. He also started a certificate course at Harvest Bible College. In reconciling his death sentence with his faith in God, Chan said:  Execution and funeral  By order of the Indonesian government, Chan was executed by firing squad on 29 April 2015 at 12:25 am WIB along with Sukumaran and six other prisoners. Chan and the other seven prisoners refused to be blindfolded. They sang \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"10,000 Reasons (Bless the Lord)\\" before being shot by a 12-member firing squad. Chan, being an NRL and rugby league fan, reportedly wore his Penrith Panthers jersey to his execution. Amnesty International condemned the executions, describing them as \\"reprehensible\\". Chan's funeral was conducted at Hillsong Church, Baulkham Hills, on 8 May 2015.

From 1945 to the early sixties, he was married to Princess Faiza, sister of King Farouk of Egypt. Bulent Rauf dedicated many years of his life to teaching the Islamic concept of \\"the one Absolute Unity of all existence\\" (tawhid). Among other things, the British mystic and author Reshad Feild, who portrayed him as \\"Hamid\\" in his well-known book The Last Barrier, considered him to be his 'teacher'. However, Bulent Rauf himself emphasized the Islamic view that Muhammad was the final prophet, and that each person is taught directly by their own life with no intermediary. Rauf's chief literary work was the complete rendering into English of Ibn 'Arabi's Fus√ªs al-Hikam (The Bezels of Wisdom), incorporating the four volume Ottoman commentary attributed to Ismail Hakki Bursevi. Bulent Rauf was instrumental in founding the Beshara School for Esoteric Education in Scotland in 1975, which has been attended by hundreds of students from all over the world. He lived at Chisholme and Turkey from 1975 until his death and was a consultant to the school throughout that period. Bulent Rauf was the first president of the Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi Society, which is dedicated to making known the work of the Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, and encouraged translation and publication of his writings. Rauf led the society until his death in 1987.

Early career (1997‚Äì1999) Debuting in 1997 as a 17-year-old, the young Whitnall was recruited in the 1996 AFL Draft under the father-son rule, with his father Graeme having played 66 games for Carlton in the 1970s and 1980s. The young red-headed, freckled Whitnall, known as \\"Banger\\", \\"Big Red\\" or simply \\"Red\\", quickly established himself in Carlton's best 22, kicking four goals on debut, and missing only a handful of games in 1997 and playing every game in 1998 and 1999. He became a vital part of Carlton's forward line, and in Round 17, 1998 against the Western Bulldogs, the then-19-year-old Whitnall became one of the youngest players to kick 8 goals in a game. It was in this match that he well and truly had established his presence. Whitnall finished with 46 goals for the 1998 season, followed by 55 goals in 1999. Mid-career (2000‚Äì2003) In 2000 Whitnall had his best ever season when he kicked 70 goals, including his career best 9.4 against Brisbane in Round 16, and was named in the All-Australian Team. However, From there, the talented Whitnall had suffered a number of setbacks in his career, with ongoing injury and weight problems. Late career (2004‚Äì2007) In 2005, Whitnall turned around his previous weight problems and came out looking as fit as he had ever been. He performed very well during 2005 and 2006, playing predominately as the senior member of the Blues' young backline. He capped off a solid 2006 with victory in the Blues' best and fairest (the John Nicholls Medal), and at the age of 27, Whitnall became the second youngest Carlton player (after Robert Walls) to play 200 AFL games. A long term member of the leadership team, and widely regarded as having one of the best football brains in the game, Whitnall first took over the captaincy of the team during Anthony Koutoufides' hand injury in 2006, and became the full-time captain in 2007 after Koutoufides relinquished the position. However he struggled in 2007 with ongoing problems with a degenerative condition in his knee. At the completion of the 2007 season, concerns by the club about his degenerative knee being able to stand up to the pressures of AFL football forced Whitnall into retirement, bringing his 11-season, 216 game career at Carlton to an end at 28 years of age.

A loose forward, Stuart briefly represented at a provincial level in 1941, and, after the war, from 1947 until 1953. He was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, from 1949 to 1954, playing in 27 matches, including seven internationals. He captained the All Blacks on their 1953‚Äì54 tour of Britain, Ireland, France and North America. In 1956, Stuart was a coaching advisor for the All Blacks during the South African tour of New Zealand, and between 1958 and 1959 he was one of the two selector‚Äìcoaches of the Canterbury provincial side. From 1974 to 1989, he was a member of the New Zealand Rugby Union board, and he served as a New Zealand delegate to the International Rugby Board from 1978. In the 1974 New Year Honours, Stuart was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to agriculture and sport. Stuart died in Wellington on 11 May 2005, and was buried at MƒÅkara Cemetery.

The first incarnation of the Selbstschutz was a German paramilitary organisation formed after World War I for ethnic Germans who lived outside Germany in the territories occupied by Germany and Austria-Hungary following the conclusion of the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk. The purpose of these units was to protect local ethnic-German communities and, indirectly, to serve German security interests in southern Ukraine. Another iteration of the Selbstschutz concept was established in Silesia and aimed at returning Polish-inhabited territories back to Germany following the rebirth of Poland. In 1921, the units of Selbstschutz took part in the fights against the Polish Third Silesian Uprising. The third incarnation operated in territories of Central and Eastern Europe before and after the beginning of World War II notably in Poland, the Free City of Danzig, Czechoslovakia and Ukraine. This Selbstschutz organization took on the character of the Nazi-era in which it was formulated and organized. In 1938, a campaign was started by local Selbstschutz in the Czechoslovakian Sudetenland in order to subjugate the local Czechs prior to the Munich Conference. During the Invasion of Poland of 1939, a number of similar units conducted sabotage actions directed by the emissaries trained in Nazi Germany. These groups were officially merged into one organization, the ethnic German Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Self-Defense Force) of more than 100,000 men. They took part in fighting the Poles as the Fifth Column, but also served as auxiliary forces of the Gestapo, SS and SD during the early stages of the occupation of Poland, and helped the Nazi administration in the newly formed Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Reichsgau Wartheland. They served as local controllers, informers, and members of execution squads particularly active in the wave of mass murders of Polish intelligentsia during Operation Tannenberg and other more local and vengeful atrocities. The killings of Poles and Jews ascribed specifically to members of Volksdeutsche Selbstschutz is estimated at the minimum of 10,000 men, women and children.Jansen and Weckbecker, 1992, pp. 7-8 The force was disbanded in winter 1939/40 and the majority of its members joined the German SS or Gestapo by the spring of the following year. Post- First World War Mennonite units After the occupation of Ukraine by German and Austro-Hungarian forces in 1918, the German occupying authorities assisted in establishing Selbstschutz units drawn from the numerous ethnic-German communities in southern Ukraine. The Selbstschutz assisted in serving German security interests in Ukraine following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Russian Mennonite men were included in this program and members were drawn from the Molotschna and Chortitza Mennonite colonies with training and armaments provided by the German imperial army. Before the end of the occupation, German soldiers supervised the creation of several Selbstschutz units, leaving weapons, ammunition, and a few officers to command the groups. Together with a neighboring Lutheran German colony, the young men from Molotschna formed twenty companies totaling 2,700 infantry and 300 cavalry. During the Russian Civil War, these forces were initially successful in holding back the forces of anarchist Nestor Makhno until March 1919. However, the self-defense groups were ultimately overwhelmed and forced to retreat and disband when Makhno's partisans allied with, and were reinforced by, the Red Army. As the Russian Civil War progressed, some Mennonites were integrated within ethnic battalions of the Russian Volunteer Army. The attempt to defend the villages departed from the traditional Mennonite teaching of nonresistance and was disapproved of by many colonists. Others regarded the collapse of effective governmental authority as sufficient justification for the creation of self-defense units. This sentiment was reinforced by horrific atrocities committed by anarchist bands against Mennonite communities. While Selbstschutz units had some success in protecting Mennonite communities from further atrocities and in providing time for the civil population to flee to areas held by White Russian forces, the abandonment of nonresistance proved to be highly divisive. Some believed that the self-defense actions may have inflamed anarchist atrocities committed against Mennonite civilians. As a result, later church conferences and delegations officially condemned the self-defense measures as a \\"grave mistake\\".Smith, 1981, p. 316 Silesia and Poland Selbstschutz militia were also active in Silesia on the German side of the Polish/German conflicts in the area. In 1921, its organized units resisted the Polish rebellion in the Third Silesian Uprising; which was aimed at seceding Upper Silesia from Germany. World War II Selbstschutz chiefs ready for SS-Aktionen in Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania The Selbstschutz were reintroduced during the late 1930s in Poland and Czechoslovakia. The Selbstschutz activists worked to indoctrinate ethnic Germans locally and commit acts of terrorism against the Czech population in the Sudetenland.The Avalon Project : Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 3 - Eleventh Day In the interwar period, the German minority organizations in Poland included Jungdeutsche Partei (Young German party), Deutsche Vereinigung (German Union), Deutscher Volksbund (German peoples Union) and Deutscher Volksverband (German peoples United). All of them actively cooperated with Nazi Germany in anti-Polish espionage, sabotage, provocations, and political indoctrination. They maintained close contact with and were directed by the NSDAP (Nazi Party), Auslandsorganisation (Foreign Affairs Organization), Gestapo (Secret Police), SD (Security Service) and Abwehr (Defense). By October 1938, SD agents were organizing the Selbstschutz in Poland. Ethnic Germans with Polish citizenship were trained in the Third Reich in various sabotage methods and guerilla tactics. Even before the war, Selbstschutz activists from Poland helped to organize lists of Poles who later were to be arrested or executed in Operation Tannenberg. With the beginning of the Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Selbstschutz units engaged in hostilities towards the Polish population and military, and performed sabotage operations helping the German attack on the Polish state. In mid-September, the chaotic and autonomous activities of this organization were coordinated by SS officers. Himmler placed Gustav Berger, a police official from Offenbach, in charge of the organization and district commanders in occupied zones made by the German army were put in place -- West Prussia, Upper Silesia and Warthegau. While the SS leadership was limited to overseeing the operations, local units remained under the control of ethnic Germans who had proven their commitment at the beginning of the war. =Participation in war crimes= Selbstschutz set up locations for massacres of interned Poles. At times, they were organized in places where the Wehrmacht and Ordnungspolizei already established concentration camps. There were 19 such locations recorded in the following Polish cities: Bydgoszcz (see Bromberg-Ost), Brodnica (renamed Strasburg), Che≈Çmno (see Che≈Çmno extermination camp), Dorposz Szlachecki, Kamie≈Ñ Kraje≈Ñski, Karolewo, Lipno (renamed Lippe), ≈Åob≈ºenica, Nak≈Ço (Nakel), Nowy Wiec near Skarszew, Nowe on the Vistula, Piastoszyn, P≈Çutowo, Sƒôp√≥lno Kraje≈Ñskie, Solec Kujawski (Schulitz), Tuchola (Tuchel), WƒÖbrze≈∫no (Briesen), Wolental near Sk√≥rcz, and Wyrzysk (Wirsitz). The majority of the arrested Poles ‚Äì men, women and youth ‚Äì were murdered on the spot by the Selbstschutz executioners. After the German invasion of Poland Selbstschutz worked together with the Einsatzgruppen in the mass murder of ethnic Poles. For example, they took part in the massacres in Pia≈õnica, the first elimination \\"aktion\\" of Polish intelligentsia. Between 12,000 and 16,000 civilians were murdered there. The Intelligenzaktion was aimed at eliminating Poland's leadership in the country. The murder operations began soon after the attack on Poland and lasted from the fall of 1939 until the spring of 1940.Encyklopedia PWN, Intelligenzaktion. September‚ÄìNovember 1939. As the result of Nazi genocidal policy, in 10 regional actions 60,000 Polish teachers, entrepreneurs, landowners, social workers, military veterans, members of national organisations, priests, judges, and political activists were killed.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, \\"By≈Ç rok 1939 Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion\\". IPN Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej, 2009, The Intelligenzaktion was continued by the German AB-Aktion operation in Poland.Meier, Anna \\"Die Intelligenzaktion: Die Vernichtung Der Polnischen Oberschicht Im Gau Danzig-Westpreusen\\" VDM Verlag Dr. M√ºller, In West Prussia, the Selbstschutz organization led by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Ludolf von Alvensleben was 17,667 men strong, and by 5 October 1939 had already executed 4,247 Poles. Notably, Alvensleben complained to the Selbstschutz officers that too few Poles had been shot. German officers had reported to him that only a fraction of Poles had been \\"destroyed\\" in the region, with the total number of those executed in West Prussia during this action being about 20,000. One Selbstschutz commander, Wilhelm Richardt, said in Karolewo (Karlhof) that he did not want to build big camps for Poles and feed them, and that it was an honour for Poles to fertilize the German soil with their corpses. There was visible enthusiasm for activities of the Selbstschutz among those involved in the action. Only in one case a Selbstschutz commander was relieved of duty after failing to finish his job with \\"only\\" 300 Poles executed. The total number of Selbstschutz members in Poland is estimated by historians at 82,000. The organization was ordered to be dissolved on 26 November 1939 in favour of service with the SS, yet the work continued until the spring of 1940. Among the reasons for dissolution were the Selbstschutz extreme corruption, disorderly behaviour and conflicts with other organizations as well as excessive use of force. The existence of a large paramilitary organization of ethnic Germans with Polish citizenship engaged in widespread massacres of ethnic Poles in the course of German war against Poland was one of the reasons for the expulsion of Germans after the war. A description of Selbstschutz involvement made available by the Polish State Museum in Sztutowo contains material compiled three years before the war broke out, for the Nazi authorities to use in extermination of the Poles thereafter.

Early life and education Joseph Jon Bruno was born in Los Angeles on November 17, 1946 to Dorothy and Joseph J. Bruno. Together with his sister, Bruno was raised in Los Angeles and attended local city schools. Bruno holds a license in criminology from California State University, Long Beach (1972) and a bachelor's degree in physical education from the California State University, Los Angeles (1974). He holds a Master of Divinity degree (1977) from the Virginia Theological Seminary, which also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in 2001. Bruno was a police officer in the city of Burbank, California. He was also briefly a professional football player under contract to the Denver Broncos before an injury sustained early on prevented further activity with the team. Priesthood Bruno was ordained to the priesthood in 1978 in the Diocese of Los Angeles by its fourth bishop, the Rt. Rev. Robert Claflin Rusack. From 1977 to 1979, Bruno was parish associate at St. Patrick's Church in Thousand Oaks, California. He was associate at St. Mary's Church in Eugene, Oregon from 1979 to 1980, while concurrently vicar of St. Teresa's in Junction City, Oregon. He was active both in building church facilities and new congregations. In 1980, he left St. Mary's to help form St. Matthew's Church, also in Eugene, where he served as vicar for several years before returning to California. From 1983 to 1986, he was associate at St. Paul's Church in Pomona, California. He was named rector of St. Athanasius' Parish in 1986, and there collaborated with Bishop Borsch in construction of the Cathedral Center on the parish's lakefront site in the Echo Park district of Los Angeles. As pastor of this congregation, Bruno continued his advocacy for youth and families, for gang diversion, and for immigration equity, and worked in the wider sphere of human rights. He served for eight years as Provost of the Cathedral Center of St. Paul, Los Angeles and as pastor to its multilingual congregation of St. Athanasius, which dates from 1864 as the oldest Episcopal parish in southern California. While provost, Bruno chaired the board of the Episcopal Community Federal Credit Union. He was vice-chair of the Nehemiah West Housing Corporation, which has built 300 single-family dwellings for purchase by low- and moderate-income families. Bruno was elected Bishop Coadjutor of the Diocese of Los Angeles on November 13, 1999. Within Episcopal Church polity, a bishop coadjutor is elected to succeed a diocesan bishop at such time as the latter chooses to retire. From 1990 to 1993, Bruno served the Diocese of Los Angeles as its missioner for stewardship and development. He was an elected deputy to the national church's 2000 General Convention, having assisted in the convention's operations and security services for several years. He is founder of the Institute for Urban Research and Development, the work of which is now related to Episcopal Housing and Economic Development, an institution of the Diocese of Los Angeles. As bishop, Bruno has launched the \\"Hands in Healing\\" initiative for education and action related to eradicating violence in local, regional, national, and international contexts. Bruno was a member of the wider Episcopal Church's Executive Council, as well as the Los Angeles Council of Religious Leaders. He was board chairman and honorary chairman of various diocesan institutions. Bishop Bruno was ordained to the episcopate on April 29, 2000, in a liturgy at the Los Angeles Convention Center. He was seated on February 1, 2002, surrounded by more than 1,000 Episcopalians and guests who joined hands around Echo Park Lake. Bruno is the first native Angeleno to be elected as bishop of the Diocese of Los Angeles, which was established in 1895. Misconduct charges On May 17, 2015, Bruno announced to parishioners of St. James the Great, Newport Beach, that he had sold the church for $15 million to Legacy Partners Residential Development to be re- developed into 22 luxury townhomes. After dispute and protests from the church's parishioners over their will to remain an active parish and deed restrictions, on June 26, 2015, Bruno sued the original donor of the land of the church, the Griffith Company of Irvine, California, for title slander. On June 29, 2015, representatives of the Diocese of Los Angeles changed the locks of St. James the Great, Newport Beach, so that parishioners could no longer access the church. In response, the congregation, which continued to worship outdoors near the vacant church, filed a misconduct complaint against Bruno with the national church. On June 29, 2017, the Most Reverend Michael Curry, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, placed a \\"Partial Restriction on the Ministry of a Bishop\\" on the Rt. Rev. Jon Bruno of the Diocese of Los Angeles. During the period of the restriction, the Bishop, acting individually, or as Bishop Diocesan, or as Corporate Sole, or in any other capacity, is forbidden from closing on the sale of the St. James property, or otherwise selling or conveying the property or contracting to sell the property, or, in any way assisting in the sale or conveyance of the property. On August 3, 2017, the Hearing Panel issued a final order, finding that Bishop Bruno had violated the Episcopal Canons, by selling the St. James property without standing committee approval, by misrepresentations about St. James and its congregation, and by conduct unbecoming of a member of the clergy. The Hearing Panel recommended that Bishop Bruno be suspended from his position and from all ministry for a period of three years. Church and philosophy The Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Los Angeles serves 70,000 Episcopalians in 148 congregations located in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties, and part of Riverside County. Served by some 400 clergy, the diocese also includes over 40 Episcopal schools and some 20 social-service and chaplaincy institutions. The diocese promotes affordable housing and entrepreneurship in Southern California through the Episcopal Housing Alliance and Economic Development. A major project is Chefs Center of California, a small-business incubator in Pasadena, California, that enables culinary entrepreneurs to start and accelerate the successful growth of their enterprises. Primary financial support for the Chefs Center is provided by the Henry T. Nicholas III Foundation, which has contributed $1,350,000 to the incubator. Bruno, in collaboration with the Reverend Bryan Jones of Long Beach, published a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times's \\"California\\" section, on July 23, 2006. Titled Open Hearted, Open Minded Christianity, the tract called for an inclusive Christianity based on loving God and loving one's neighbor as oneself. With Malcolm Boyd, Bruno is co- author of the book In Times Like These: How We Pray (New York: Church Publishing, 2005).

He is most often credited for his works as A.E. Doyle. He opened his own architectural practice in 1907. From 1908 to 1914, he partnered with William B. Patterson, and their firm was known as Doyle & Patterson.  Biography  Doyle was born in Santa Cruz, California, and moved with his family at a very young age to Portland, Oregon, where he married Lucie Godley (1877‚Äì1953) and ultimately established his architectural practice. He began an apprenticeship with the firm of Whidden & Lewis in 1893 and remained until 1906, with the exception of two years in New York with the office of Henry Bacon. While with Whidden & Lewis he may have substantially designed the Forestry Building of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. While with Henry Bacon, he attended architectural classes at, but was not enrolled in, Columbia University.Beauty of the City: A.E. Doyle, Portland's Architect. Oregon State University Press, 2008, Philip Niles, pgs 39-40 From April to December 1906 he made a \\"grand tour\\" of Europe. After returning to Portland, he opened his own practice, in 1907. After securing the commission for a major addition to the Meier & Frank store, he formed a partnership with architect William B. Patterson, in 1908. The firm, Doyle & Patterson, lasted until 1914. Patterson served as the engineer and superintendent for the firm. When work dried up in 1914, the partnership dissolved and Doyle again practiced on his own as A.E. Doyle, Architect. Doyle & Patterson's Revival- and Italianate-style works set the tone for other commercial buildings in Portland, especially the use of glazed terra-cotta. A series of residential cabins along the Oregon and Washington coasts inspired a regional style that was widely emulated in the 1930s. Doyle also designed Portland's iconic public drinking fountains known as Benson Bubblers.Portland Water Bureau Another extremely prominent project that Doyle was tapped to build was the fledgling Reed College campus. Competition to design Reed College was fierce and many of the city's top architects made bids. On January 5, 1911, the Reed Trustees announced that Doyle & Patterson had been elected unanimously. Doyle envisioned a large college of Gothic-inspired dormitories and grassy quadrangles. Early plans, and numerous conferences with the college's then-president, William T. Foster, led to two quintessential Doyle creations: the Reed College Hall of Arts and Science, now Eliot Hall, and a dormitory originally envisioned to house the college's male population, now commonly referred to as Old Dorm Block. Unbuilt works include additions to the now-demolished Portland Hotel (currently the site of Pioneer Courthouse Square) and to the Doyle-designed U.S. National Bank Building. Doyle also drew up an original design for the Equitable Building which called for an Art Deco skyscraper design. The building ended up being built after World War II by Pietro Belluschi in its noted and early International Style design. Doyle is sometimes credited with the design for Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood near Government Camp, Oregon, but he was merely one of several architects solicited to draw up plans for the building, which ended up being designed by Forest Service architects. In the 1920s, Doyle's firm had a second period of growth. In 1925, Doyle hired the young Pietro Belluschi. Doyle died in Portland on January 23, 1928, of Bright's disease. The firm continued as A.E. Doyle & Associates until 1943, when the name was changed to Pietro Belluschi, Architect. Doyle's collection of architecture books and some personal papers was purchased by Reed College in 1992. Work Buildings marked (NRHP) are on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town is situated in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council inside the Kosciuszko National Park. Its name is a corruption of Aboriginal 'Gianderra' for 'sharp stones for knives'. It was earlier called Gibson's Plains, named after Dr. Gibson, a settler in the district in 1839. For a century (until the establishment of Cabramurra), Kiandra was Australia's highest town. Kiandra lies approximately north-west of Cooma on the Snowy Mountains Highway between Adaminaby and Talbingo. It sits at above sea level and is situated on a high, treeless ridge on the banks of the Eucumbene River, which is snow-covered during winter and is subject to high winds. It lies in the Australian Alps montane grasslands bioregion according to Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia. After decades of decline, restoration work on the remaining buildings at Kiandra took place from 2009 to 2020, including work on the historic Kiandra Courthouse Chalet and Wolgal Lodge fishing cottage being conducted by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and volunteers, enabling occasional amenities and limited accommodation at Kiandra.http://www.kiandraproject.com/index.html The remaining buildings in the town were either destroyed or severely damaged during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season.

Significant numbers of Chinese people worked the Kiandra goldfields. Chinese miners built Three Mile Dam in 1882 to assist with sluicing operations at \\"New Chum Hill\\". The scenic lake still exists and now supplies Selwyn Snowfields with its snow-making water requirements. Wikipedia's Chinese site lists Kiandra as Â•áÂÆâÂæ∑Êãâ (Qi An De La). The last mining operations finally ceased around 1905. Official total production recorded was 48 676 kg. In 1890 the second courthouse to be built in the township was constructed. The building included police barracks and was used more for its police rather than court function. It remained Kiandra's police station until 1937, later to become the Kiandra Chalet. A 'battery stamper' and other mining relics recovered locally are situated on the road to Cabramurra below New Chums Hill, close to the NPWS entry booth (which is only attended during the snow season).

To avoid confusion with a conventional skate, the skates were described as (two palings turned up at the front end and about four foot long). There were no fence palings or posts in Kiandra in 1861.There is little or no timber in the country here, and whatever there is, is of no use for fencing or house building purposes. The Yass Courier, 4 August 1862. Ski races were held annually on Township Hill at Kiandra, which led to the founding of the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club‚Äîreportedly becoming the \\"world's longest continuously running ski club\\" as it evolved into the present-day Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club in Perisher Valley, NSW. Whether the club is the first of its kind has been subject to debate. At one time, the poet Banjo Paterson was a vice president. The Club held perhaps the first international ski race carnival in 1908. In 1927, William Hughes, a member of the Club, together with four members of the Ski Club of Australia made the first historic ski traverse from Kiandra to the Hotel Kosciusko. Their eventful journey is retold in Klaus Hueneke's book \\"Kiandra to Kosciusko\\" and was commemorated by 150 ski tourers in 1977 in an event organised by the Kosciusko Huts Association. The Kiandra courthouse closed as a police station in 1937, and was for a time used as a private residence, before becoming the Kiandra Chalet (until 1953) and later the Kiandra Chalet Hotel, The owner of the Chalet ran a ski rope tow. The Chalet closed in 1973 and the building became a Roads Depot building. Australia's first T-Bar was installed on Township Hill in 1957, but in 1978, Kiandra's ski lift operations re-located permanently to nearby Selwyn Snowfields.http://www.selwynsnow.com.au/templates/sel/page/page_html_standard.php?secID=69 The T-Bar remained in operation at Mt Selwyn until the 2009 ski season when it was replaced by the Township Triple Chair (retaining the name \\"Township\\" in reference to the Kiandra Township hill run). =Restoration= Kiandra courthouse before 2010 restoration Kiandra courthouse after the 2010 restorationThe last resident left Kiandra in 1974, after which the NPWS took over the town and completed its demolition of most of its buildings. This decision by the NPWS not to preserve much of the human heritage of the township remains a source of resentment in some quarters in the district to this day. Only four buildings from the former township remain intact, together with a collection of ruins and the historic cemetery. The area retains various other relics of Australian pioneer history, including mining equipment, old gravesites and abandoned diggings. The remaining buildings at Kiandra are of high heritage value and historical walking trails provided information on the former layout and points of interests of the old town. The most substantial remaining building is the former courthouse, which was originally constructed in 1890, and which was partially restored by National Parks in 2010, Stokes Rousseau and carpenters Sean Walker and Barry Ellwood from Furnbiz for use as an interpretive centre. The restored court room was officially opened on 5 May 2010 with some 150 people present for the ceremony. The later additions to the original courthouse at the rear of the building remain in a state of outward disrepair, although National Parks intended to continue the restoration in stages, aiming to preserve the cultural history of the site across its many previous uses.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/media/DecMedia10060204.htm In 2012, public accommodation returned to Kiandra with the opening of the restored Wolgal Lodge for bookings. The opening of the 1960s fishing cottage was in part conducted to create and demonstrate a market demand for Kiandra- based accommodation, which, according to the Snowy Times, could prove a \\"market based argument for restoring the Kiandra Courthouse and Chalet for accommodation\\".http://www.snowytimes.com/picnic-with-the-past-by-pauline- downing/ Easter 2013 saw all four of Kiandra's buildings in public use for the first time in decades - with guided tours and exhibitions - including the Matthew's Cottage exhibition and the Pattinson's cottage house museum.http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/1387/four-buildings-one- positive-future/ =2020 bushfire= During the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season, on 3 January 2020, the Dunns Road fire burned from Batlow into Kosciuszko National Park and burning much of the northern part of the park.

A number of interesting photographic studies were taken of life at Kiandra, including a series by Charles Kerry, and a scene of Chinese miners near the Township. Climate Owing to its elevation, Kiandra has a warm- summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb), as at least 4 months see an average temperature above and at least one month sees an average temperature below according to the 1897‚Äì1974 period of record and an extrapolated 1980‚Äì2010 timeframe,Beck, H.E., N.E.

This (continental) climate type is very rare in the Southern Hemisphere and almost nonexistent in Australia, with Kiandra being the only Bureau of Meteorology weather station with it. However, as the July average was only slightly below freezing in the period of record, it is predicted given current trends that in the near future it will change into a temperate highland or oceanic (Cfb) climate (indeed, using the alternative isotherm it already is one), though no official weather station is currently operational to record such a shift. Climate statistics were compiled at the Kiandra Chalet site, elevation AMSL, from the year 1866 until 1974; temperature averages from 1897 to 1974. The lowest temperature recorded was on 21 July 1965, and again on 10 August 1966. On 31 January 1968, the highest temperature of was recorded, although absolute records only span back to 1957 at Kiandra Chalet, thus missing the tremendous heat of January 1939.

It is located in Psychico, a suburb north of the Greek capital. In student population terms, the Moraitis school is one of the largest private schools in Athens. Its teaching aims at university entry. It has 1700 students and 240 teachers in kindergarten, primary, middle school and high school.  History  The school was founded in 1936 by Charles Beregean (Karolos Berzan), a mathematician (there is no source verifying either a degree or any articles in mathematics authored by Beregean), under the name ‚ÄúStandard Lyceum of Athens‚Äù (, ). It moved to its current location in 1952, when ownership was transferred to - whose name the school has adopted since 1976. After Antonis Moraitis' death in 1981, property and administration of the school was transferred to his daughters: Chrysanthi Moraiti-Kartali (middle and high school) and Katerina Moraiti (primary school, until her death in 1996). Today the school is run by Chrisanthi Moraiti-Kartali, Giorgos Kasimatis, Antonis Kartalis and Giorgos Kartalis. The school proclaims 12 fundamental principles (Dodecalogue, , ), ranging from religious tolerance to the equivalent of Beckett's \\"fail again; fail better\\" premise, as a guide for all its members.  Academics  Almost all of the school's students are enrolled to universities in Greece and abroad, upon graduation. For their final two years, students at Moraitis can follow either the Greek educational system curriculum or the International Baccalaureate programme. About 16% of Moraitis students achieve a grade of more than 19/20 in the Pan-Hellenic Examinations, with about 50% achieving over 17/20. In 2013, the average grade of Moraitis School IB students was 36/45 (compared to a global average of 29), with two students achieving a grade of 45/45 and five 44/45.

It is unknown if the soldiers' enthusiasm is genuine or if the scene was staged for propaganda purposes. German soldiers being cheered in L√ºbeck during their advance to the front lines in 1914. The Spirit of 1914 (German: Augusterlebnis) was the alleged jubilation in Germany at the outbreak of World War I. Many individuals remembered that euphoria erupted on 4 August 1914, after all the political parties in the Reichstag, including the previously- antimilitarist Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), supported the war credits in a unanimous vote, later referred to as the Burgfrieden (literally \\"castle peace\\" but more accurately \\"party truce\\"). Many, particularly those in the middle class, believed Germany had ended its decades of bitter domestic political conflict. The string of military victories in the following weeks, which demonstrated what Germany could accomplish when unified and suggested that the war would be short, reinforced the ebullience. Many on the political right accordingly believed until the Nazi era that those first weeks of the war were Germany's finest hour, the German equivalent of the French Revolution. Until the 1990s, most historians took the memory of the Spirit of 1914 at face value and claimed that the enthusiasm in August 1914 was universal. The reality was more complex. There was widespread apprehension when Germany declared war on 1 August 1914, and civilians watched their loved ones march off to battle in the following weeks. Middle-class nationalists were the most enthusiastic and published countless tracts and editorials hailing the new political unity. An estimated one million war poems were sent to German newspapers in August 1914 alone. Dissent was smothered by this overabundance of literature cheering the war, the promise not to violate the Burgfrieden and the fear of undermining support for loved ones on the front. It accordingly appeared that the Spirit of 1914 was universal. The memory of Spirit of August 1914 persisted even when the actual support for the war waned with the horrifying casualties on the front and the terrible hunger on the home front caused by the British blockade of Germany. During the Weimar Republic, the popular perception that Germany had been stabbed in the back rendered the public vulnerable to the Nazis, who embraced the language of the Spirit of 1914 with their aim of seizing power throughout Germany.

The name originates from the Old Slavonic word kolo (–∫–æ–ª–æ) meaning \\"circle\\", \\"wheel\\".  Hungarian tradition  The Hungarian kal√°cs (pronounced [Ààk…ílaÀêt É]) is a sweet bread very similar to brioche, usually baked in a braided form, and traditionally considered an Easter food. Until the end of the 19th century, the preparation of kal√°cs was similar to that of everyday bread; the difference was in the shape, and in the better/quality flour used for the kal√°cs. Nowadays kal√°cs is prepared from dough enriched with milk and eggs. It is baked in an oven or brick oven, sometimes directly on the stones of the brick oven, or on a baking sheet. Kal√°cs is part of the traditional Easter menu in Hungary, often consecrated together with ham in Catholic churches. In the Szeged region at All Saints unfilled kal√°cs was baked called All Saints' Kal√°cs (mindenszentek kal√°csa, kolduskal√°cs = Beggar's Kal√°cs), which was given to beggars at the gate of the graveyard. Also kal√°cs was given to beggars praying at the graveyard's gate in Csall√≥k√∂z to prevent the dead from returning. Giving kal√°cs to beggars is the Christian form of the pagan tradition of treating the dead. Romanian tradition Making colaci The traditional Romanian colac is a braided bread, typically made for special occasions or holidays, such as Christmas, Easter, weddings, and funerals. It is a traditional custom of Romanian rural society, on Christmas Eve, to gather in groups, to go in different houses and to sing colinde, traditional Christmas carols. In some villages, they go first to the mayor's house, followed by the teacher's house, whereas in other parts there is no pre- established order. The families would then invite them into the house, and give them different small gifts such as nuts, dried fruits, and colacs. The word came from Slavic kolaƒç and ultimately from Proto-Slavic kolo (\\"circle\\", \\"wheel\\") referring to the circular form.Colac (in Romanian).

Historically, kalach meant any kind of white bread, and before modern methods of grinding wheat came into use, white bread was classed as a type of fancy bread. Kalach usually looks like a circle, but one part of is it significantly thinner, and the other is significantly thicker. The traditional explanation is that the thinner part was used as a \\"handle\\" so kalach could be eaten even by workers who had no time to wash their hands. After eating, the handle was thrown away or given to the poor. Because only desperate people ate the handles that had been thrown away, this is thought to be the origin of the Russian saying \\"go down to the handle\\" (–¥–æ–π—Ç–∏ –¥–æ —Ä—É—á–∫–∏, doyti do ruchki) meaning to experience a profound setback, to hit rock bottom. =Cultural legacy= A man who made kalaches was called a kalachnik (–∫–∞–ª–∞—á–Ω–∏–∫), which sometimes became kalashnik (–∫–∞–ª–∞—à–Ω–∏–∫) due to the sandhi effect. Such a man's descendants might be given the surname Kalachnikov (–ö–∞–ª–∞—á–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤) or Kalashnikov (–ö–∞–ª–∞—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, \\"[son] of the kalach-maker\\"). Ukrainian tradition Ukrainian kolaches are made by braiding dough made with wheat flour into ring-shaped or oblong forms. They are a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good bounty, and are traditionally prepared for Svyat Vechir (Holy Supper), the Ukrainian Christmas Eve ritual. For Christmas kolach three braided loaves of varied sizes are stacked representing the Trinity. The bread's circular shape symbolizes eternity. When served as part of Christmas dinner, a candle is placed in the center of the intricately braided loaves, but the bread can't be eaten until Christmas Day because observance of the Advent fasting requires abstaining from eggs until midnight on Christmas Eve.\\"Sweet Treats around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture\\". p. 346. ABC-CLIO. For funerals, the loaves are brought to church for Divine Liturgy to be blessed and then served in slices with fresh fruit as a symbol of the good the deceased did in their lifetime. Exact customs vary but as an example the three loaves are decorated with three apples, three oranges, and grapes, with a candle placed in the center. Sometimes a small individual loaf is given. In the area around Kyiv, it was custom for a midwife to give a kolach as a gift to parents, as part of a fertility blessing. Kalaches were also used in funeral ceremonies. As well in Galicia and Bukovina they were given by children to their godparents in ceremony called a kolachyny (–∫–æ–ª–∞ÃÅ—á–∏–Ω–∏) or kolachannya (–∫–æ–ª–∞ÃÅ—á–∞–Ω–Ω—è).

A media blackout may be voluntary, or may in some countries be enforced by the government or state. The latter case is controversial in peacetime, as some regard it as a human rights violation and repression of free speech. Press blackout is a similar phrase, but refers specifically to printed media. Media blackouts are used, in particular, in times of declared war, to keep useful intelligence from the enemy. In some cases formal censorship is used, in others the news media may cooperate, as in the UK D- (later DA-)Notice system in the Second World War.

As a result, the Japanese learned the fate of only one of their bombs, which landed in Wyoming, but failed to explode. The Japanese stopped all launches after less than six months. The press blackout in the U.S. was lifted after the first deaths from fire balloons, to ensure that the public was warned, though public knowledge of the threat could have possibly prevented the deaths. News of the loss of over 4,000 lives when UK ship RMS Lancastria was sunk during the war was voluntarily suppressed to prevent it affecting civilian morale, but was published after it became known overseas. =Contemporary= A media blackout was used during the 2005 New York City transit strike to allow for more effective contract negotiation between the two sides of the dispute.NYSun.com (2005-12-27)'Media Blackout' Retrieved on 21 August 2009.

In 2008, the fact that Prince Harry, then third in line to the British throne, was serving on active duty in Afghanistan was subject to a blackout in the British media for his own safety. He was brought home early after the blackout was broken by foreign media. On 22 June 2009, when news came that New York Times reporter David Rohde had escaped from his Taliban captors, few knew he had even been kidnapped, because for the seven months he and two Afghan colleagues were in the Taliban's hands, The Times kept that information under wraps. Out of concern for the reporter's safety, The Times asked other major news organizations to do the same; NPR was among dozens of news outlets that did not report on the kidnapping at the urging of Rohde's colleagues. Kelly McBride, who teaches ethics to journalists at the Poynter Institute, says she was \\"really astounded\\" by the media blackout. \\"I find it a little disturbing, because it makes me wonder what else 40 international news organizations have agreed not to tell the public,\\" she tells NPR's Melissa Block. McBride says the blackout could hurt the credibility of news organizations. \\"I don't think we do ourselves any favors long term for our credibility when we have a total news blackout on something that's clearly of interest to the public,\\" she says.Melissa Block (2009-06-23) Reporter's Escape From Taliban Spurs Ethics Debate, NPR.org.

Her co-star Li Ching portrayed two different characters, a human girl and a carp who transformed into her image.  Synopsis  Zhang Zhen's family had fallen on hard times but remembering the betrothal agreement between his father and the prime minister, Master Chin, he set off for his fiance's home. When he arrived, he was distressed to receive a cold reception from his future father-in-law, who looked down on him because he was poor and was willing to fulfill his promise only after Zhang Zhen had successfully become the top scholar. He bade Zhang Zhen to stay at the Green Waves Study and prepare. After a year, Zhang Zhen still had not achieved the status of top scholar. His pampered and spoiled betrothed, Peony, after the initial introduction had already forgotten about him. All he had for a companion, were the carp and the denizens of the pond by the study. The carp spirit was touched by his care for the fish and his loneliness. She visited him one winter's night in the guise of Peony and was further impressed with his sensitive and gentlemanly considerations for her well being. She managed to persuade him that she was of like mind with his philosophies, acknowledging their betrothal and her support in his endeavors. Thus a relationship was formed. One night in spring, during the lantern festival, Zhang Zhen mistook the real Peony for his beloved and was rebuffed. Her father promptly threw him out. Shocked by his beloved's turn-about, enraged by the betrayal, disgusted with the materialistic and sanctimonious unprincipled attitudes of both father and daughter, he stormed off to return home. The carp spirit went after him and convinced him of her sincerity, telling him too that she was with child. Both decided to return to Zhang Zhen's home, 300 miles away. They attended the lantern festivities along their journey and were seen by Peony's father who thought Zhang Zhen had committed the worst of sins. When two Peonies appeared, the household was thrown into an uproar. Even the righteous Judge Pao could not come to a settlement. Finally, the father summoned an exorcist to chase away the evil spirit. The carp spirit hastily released Zhang Zhen from the shed where he was imprisoned and convinced him to run away with her. However, they were beset by the Celestial Generals and gods who were summoned to subdue her. In despair, she told Zhang Zhen the truth and was gratified when he vowed to stay by her. Just as she was about to be killed, the Goddess of Mercy intervened. The carp spirit was given two choices, return with the Goddess to continue her training to be an immortal or forsake all her powers and become human.

In engraving, it is sometimes depicted as a region of horizontal lines or else is marked with either az. or b. as an abbreviation. The term azure derives from the name of the deep blue stone now called lapis lazuli (stone of Lazhward). The word was adopted into Old French by the 12th century, after which the word passed into use in the blazon of coats of arms. As an heraldic colour, the word azure means \\"blue\\", and reflects the name for the colour in the language of the French-speaking Anglo-Norman nobles following the Norman Conquest of England. A wide range of colour values is used in the depiction of azure in armory and flags, and in common usage it is often referred to simply as 'blue'. In addition to the standard blue tincture called azure, there is a lighter blue sometimes found that is called bleu celeste or \\"sky blue\\". Neither azure nor bleu celeste is precisely defined as a particular shade of blue, but azure is consistently depicted in a much darker shade. Sometimes, the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues, and represent certain elements and precious stones. Even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries, it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are, since the information is often asked for. Many sources give different meanings, but azure is often said to represent the following: * Of jewels, the sapphire * Of heavenly bodies, Jupiter (the planet Jupiter is further associated with the metal tin in traditional alchemical/occultistic lore) Gallery File:Doln√≠ P≈ô√≠m CoA.svgArms of Doln√≠ P≈ô√≠m municipality, Hradec Kr√°lov√© District, the Czech Republic.

He was the son of Stephanus Jacobus du Toit and Elisabeth Jacoba Joubert. Life The poet D.J. Opperman (Awper-mun) compiled brief biographical notes in Afrikaans about Totius/du Toit. Du Toit began his education at the Huguenot Memorial School at Daljosafat in the Cape (1883‚Äì1885). He then moved to a German mission school named Morgensonne near Rustenburg from 1888 to 1890 before returning, between 1890 and 1894, to his original school at Daljosafat. Later he attended a theological college at Burgersdorp before becoming a military chaplain with the Boer Commandos during the Second Boer War. After the war, he studied at the Free University in Amsterdam and was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Theology. He became an ordained minister of the Reformed Church of South Africa and from 1911 he was a professor at the Theological College of this Reformed Church in Potchefstroom. As a mature man he travelled to the Netherlands and Palestine and his impressions of these visits to foreign lands are included in the collection Skemering (1948). (The word Skemering is a pun and difficult to translate. It can relate to \\"Twilight\\" but also to \\"faint recollection\\"). Du Toit was a deeply religious man and a conservative one in most senses. His small son died of an infection and his young daughter, Wilhelmina, was killed by lightning, falling into his arms dead as she ran towards him. He recorded this calamity in the poem \\"O die pyn-gedagte\\" (literally \\"Oh the pain- thoughts\\"). Du Toit was responsible for much of the translation of the Bible into Afrikaans, finishing what his father Stephanus Jacobus du Toit had begun. He also put a huge amount of work into producing poetical versions of the Psalms in Afrikaans. His poetry was in the main lyrical and dealt, inter alia, with faith, nature, British imperialism and the Afrikaner nation. He left behind many collections of poems, including Trekkerswee (1915; ‚ÄúTrekkers' Grief‚Äù) and Passieblomme (1934; ‚ÄúPassion Flowers‚Äù). He was on the committee that founded Potchefstroom GimnasiumBook: Fac et Spera 1907-1957,page 26,author:Coetsee,J.J.A in 1907 and chancellor of the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, from 1951-1953. His poetry One of the poems from Skemering was translated by C.J.D Harvey as follows: :\\"Night at Sea ‚Äì Near Aden\\" :Nothing but sea and darkness everywhere :as when the earth was desolate and void :and o'er the world-pool hung night, unalloyed :No star and no horizon visible, :no sight or sign the wandering eye to guide, :I hear only the waves beating the side. :Though she sails always on, she now sails blind, :the prow thrusts forward, cleaving through the night. :Only upon the compass, shafts of light. Another poem, from Passieblomme, translated by J.W. Marchant: :\\"The World is not our Dwelling Place\\" :The world is not our dwelling place :I see this in the sun that flees :and see it in the heron that, mistrustfully, :the same sun sees :on one leg from the reedy dale :and once the final rays are gone :a chill spills from this queachy lea :a frigid thrill runs right through me :I see it then in everything :that dusk throws round me in a ring :the world is not our dwelling place :The world is not our dwelling place :I see it when the moon blood red :rising from its field-dust bed :still (only just) the church-roof pares :from where an owl, abstrusely dumb, :sits and at that crescent stares. :As it grows quiet down the way :I recollect how, late today, :the mourners of the afternoon :emerged where owl now meets the moon :I mark it then in everything :while even tightens in a ring :the world is not our dwelling place :The world is not our dwelling place :I feel it when the winds awake :and oaken branches clash and break :I hear it in the fluttering :of little birds whose wings are thrown :against the branches smashed and blown :and find on coming closer yet :by moonbeam's vacillating light :a nest of fledglings overset :hurled down by tempest, shattered, dead :and feel it then in everything :as nighttime closes in a ring :the world is not our dwelling place Honors and recognition Du Toit (under the name Totius) has been honored by his face on a South African postage stamp in 1977.Image & prices In 1977, a statue of Totius by the sculptor Jo Roos was placed in the Totius Garden of Remembrance, in Potchefstroom.

Brixtofte served as the Tax Minister of Denmark from 19 November 1992 to 24 January 1993. He was also Mayor of Farum, and was criminally convicted for actions taken while holding that municipal office and was later jailed. He was the brother of Brixx Member, Jens Brixtofte. Mayor of Farum For several years Brixtofte was the Mayor of Farum with his party having had an absolute majority. He was quite popular and Farum was generally considered a successful municipality thanks to its success in finding jobs for the unemployed, particularly immigrants. It was held up as having been a good example by Liberal politicians during national elections. =Controversial financial and welfare programs= Brixtofte made headlines with a highly untraditional sale- and-lease-back model where the municipality sold buildings and facilities to private companies and rented them back. Due to various national tax issues this was highly advantageous for both parties. This scheme allowed the municipality to have one of the lowest tax rates in Denmark at the same time as spending a huge amount of money on various welfare programs. Every child in school was given a high-end computer and the elderly were offered a free annual trip to a foreign holiday destination. A lot of prestigious building projects were initiated such as a sports arena and marina completely out of proportion to what one would expect from a city of this size. Due to the tax issues of the sale-and-lease-back model the expenses for these programs were largely covered by all taxpayers of Denmark, most of whom got no benefit from the programs. For a long time, the legal status of the scheme was unclear. =Scandals= In February 2002 several scandals surrounding his administration were revealed in the media. The first headlines involved exceptionally high spending in his administration. It was claimed that he routinely drank luxury red wine (at a cost of around $1,200 USD per bottle) on the public expense account. Furthermore, the wine was bought at a local restaurant in which Brixtofte was a shareholder. Municipal employees reported that the charismatic mayor had over years shown increasing signs of alcoholism and established an autocratic, timid climate at the town hall. Council members said he had attempted to prevent them from investigating his spending. Multiple other incidents surfaced including the so-called \\"sponsor case\\" alleging that Brixtofte had made deals involving his municipality paying deliberate overprices for the welfare services bought from private companies who in return would sponsor the local football team (in which Brixtofte had a personal interest). Perhaps the most serious allegation accused Brixtofte of having ordered a secretary to purposely delay the payment of an invoice by one day so that Svend Petersen - a friend of Brixtofte - earned 325,000 DKR (57,000 USD) in compensation for the late payment. Svend Petersen has previously been found guilty in fraud in an unrelated case. During the initial investigations, several documents important to the case(s) mysteriously disappeared from the town hall. =Consequences= Eventually the investigations resulted in two criminal cases being raised against Brixtofte who pleaded not guilty in both. On 20 June 2006 Brixtofte was found guilty in the sponsor case (generally considered the smaller of the two) and was sentenced to jail for 2 years.Mayor sentenced, The Copenhagen Post, 22 June 2006 He appealed but this was rejected on 8 February 2007. His lawyer then announced an appeal to the Supreme Court which would, however, only be granted in exceptional circumstances and can only affect the length of the sentence, not the guilty verdict. The appeal was granted by Procesbevillingsn√¶vnet on 16 August 2007.Brixtofte f√•r lov at anke sponsorsag, Politiken, 16 August 2006 In the other legal case he was also found guilty on 10 April 2007. He was sentenced an additional 2 years of unconditional prison but appealed right away. The prosecutor also appealed for a higher sentence. Brixtofte's right- hand man, Leif Frimand Jensen, was also sentenced two years in prison, but it was made conditional due to his bad health. He also appealed. Twelve former and current councilmen were also charged, but risked only fines.Brixtofte skal fire √•r i f√¶ngsel, Jyllands Posten, 10 April 2007 The welfare and leaseback programs got an abrupt ending as well. Eventually rulings were made on the tax issues making the sale-and-lease-back model less favorable. This as well as the bad media coverage of Brixtofte meant that investors lost faith in the administration. This caused the collapse of various plans that should have kept the scheme going, such as the sale of certain building sites. On top of that came increasing rent costs from the previous sales and eventually the municipality was forced to abandon the extraordinary welfare programs and dramatically raise its taxes. It went from being one of the cheapest to one of the most expensive municipalities in Denmark.  Later political and professional life After being exposed in early 2002, Brixtofte was excluded from Venstre (Liberal Party) and replaced as a mayor by his co-partisan Lars Carpens. He did, however, retain his seat on the council. In the local elections of 2005, now for the newly merged Fures√∏ municipality, Brixtofte ran his own list, Velf√¶rdspartiet ('Welfare Party') and was re-elected with 4.8% of the votes,..Brixtofte back, The Copenhagen Post, 17 Nov 2005 As a member of Parliament, Brixtofte was excluded from Venstre's party fraction in May 2002. In 2004 he briefly joined Centrum-Demokraterne,Political switch-hitter, The Copenhagen Post, 27 Feb 2004 a minor party that had not been represented in Parliament since 2001, but left when he was not allowed to run as a parliamentary candidate until the criminal case was resolved. He kept his parliamentary seat until the elections of 8 February 2005. In 2003 Brixtofte and L√•sby-Svendsen, a well-known Danish estates, carpet and horse dealer, established the estate agency Brixtofte Emlak Turkey which specialised in selling holiday flats to Danes in Antalya. Reportedly the Turkish city has named roads and squares after Brixtofte.Property dealer, The Copenhagen Post, 13 Nov 2003 On 9 February 2007, the day after his prison sentence ended, Brixtofte was denied entry to the United States upon arriving at a New York City airport. He claimed he had long planned a brief holiday getaway with his girlfriend after his release, and that he was denied entry due to not possessing a visa. A visa is, however, not generally required for holiday visits to the U.S. by Danish citizens who can enter through the Visa Waiver Program.Brixtofte smidt ud af USA, Ekstra Bladet, 11 Feb 2007 On 12 April 2007, the Copenhagen Post reported that a Hiller√∏d court sentenced Brixtofte to two years in jail. He was found guilty of taking out a DKK 450-million loan without asking the city council for permission. He also used public funds for banquets with wine costing DKK 6000 per bottle. In June 2006, he had already been sentenced to two years in prison for a corruption scandal involving his sponsorship of Farum‚Äôs handball club. On 15 April 2008, the Danish supreme court confirmed the verdict of two years' imprisonment for the sponsorship case.Brixtofte to √•r bag tremmer (Brixtofte two years behind bars). Danmarks Radio. 15 April 2008. Brixtofte was the eligible to appeal the decisionto the European Court of Human Rights. On 28 May 2008, the Interior Ministry's Board of Eligibility stripped Brixtofte of his right to be an elected political representative, because he was undignified to serve due to the supreme court's verdict in the sponsorship case.

It has almost 42,000 inhabitants. History The history of Merksem goes back to Gallo-Roman times. During that period the region was mentioned as Merk (border) and Heim (settlement) being part of the diocese Kamerijk. Merksem has for centuries been part of a larger community together with Schoten and Sint-Job-in-'t-Goor. During the Spanish period Merksem used to be a Dominium, a known Lord of Mercxem is Anthony van Stralen. In the 16th century Merksem was separated from Schoten. =Middle Ages= Around the year 600, the Franks started colonizing the area near the local Saint-Bartholomew's Church, which was the highest point of Merksem at the time. In 750, the Scheldt river finally started settling itself into its current river bed, which resulted in parts of Merksem becoming peat bog (a type of wetland). Current street names of these areas still refer to these wetlands. (The 1998 and 1999 floods of some residential areas were due to Merksem's geographical location. This would later result in the deepening of the Schijn tributary). In May 1561, Merksem and Schoten were split up. The current Bredabaan (Breda Road) functioned as a gate between Antwerp and cities located to the north. In 1742, the road would become a toll road. =19th century= At the beginning of the 19th century, Merksem was a very rural area with a population of 750. Local farmers mainly provided the nearby city of Antwerp with straw, giving the inhabitants of Merksem the nickname \\"stroboeren\\" (straw farmers). In 1874, the area became more industrialized, and most of the land was bought by S.A. Etablissements Industriels et Commerciaux de Merxem. The company would construct the local industry dock (known as 'het dokske'). Due to its ideal location, multiple industrial and commercial companies started to establish themselves in the are, contributing to the population increase. =20th century= During World War II, Merksem was occupied by Nazi Germany from 20 May 1940 until its liberation on 4 October 1944. The local population was affected by political repression, deportation, hunger, bombings etc. Many locals opposed the occupation. Resistance fighters were deported to the nearby concentration camp of Breendonk. =Bredabaan= The road currently known as Bredabaan (Breda Road), once a major northern access to Antwerp, begins in Merksem and goes up north, all the way up until the border with the Netherlands. It ends in the Dutch city of Breda (hence the name). Other major axes would include Lambrechtshoekenlaan, Groenendaallaan, Maantjessteenweg and Ringlaan. Together with Bredabaan they could be considered as the boundaries of the centre of Merksem. Another main axis, that constitutes most of the southern border of the district, is a canal called the Albert Canal, which connects the Port of Antwerp to the river Meuse near Li√®ge and is an important connection for inland freight shipping. Economy When Delsey Airlines (VG Airlines) existed, its head office was in Merksem.\\"Contact us in Belgium:\\" Delsey Airlines. 3 December 2002. Retrieved on 8 September 2010. Sport and culture The Sportpaleis and the Lotto Arena are both located in the district of Merksem and host major sporting events, live music and festivals.

In this condition, activation of the left ventricle of the heart is delayed, which causes the left ventricle to contract later than the right ventricle. Causes Among the causes of LBBB are: * Aortic stenosis * Dilated cardiomyopathy * Acute myocardial infarction * Extensive coronary artery disease * Primary disease of the cardiac electrical conduction system * Long standing hypertension leading to aortic root dilatation and subsequent aortic regurgitation * Lyme disease * Side effect of some cardiac surgeries (e.g., aortic root reconstruction) Diagnosis Electrocardiogram showing left bundle branch block and irregular rhythm due to supraventricular extrasystoles. A left bundle branch block The criteria to diagnose a left bundle branch block on the electrocardiogram: * The heart rhythm must be supraventricular in origin * The QRS duration must be ‚â• 120 ms * There should be a QS or rS complex in lead V1 * There should be a notched ('M'-shaped) R wave in lead V6. The T wave should be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. This is known as appropriate T wave discordance with bundle branch block. A concordant T wave may suggest ischemia or myocardial infarction. There are also partial blocks of the left bundle branch: \\"left anterior fascicular block\\" (LAFB) and a \\"left posterior fascicular block\\" (LPFB). This refers to the block after the bifurcation of the left bundle branch. =Diagnostic consequences= The presence of LBBB results in that electrocardiography (ECG) cannot be used to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy or Q wave infarction, because LBBB in itself results in widened QRS complex, and changes in the ST segment consistent with ischemia or injury. Treatment  * Patients with LBBB require complete cardiac evaluation, and those with LBBB and syncope or near-syncope may require a pacemaker. * Some patients with LBBB, a markedly prolonged QRS (usually > 150 ms), and systolic heart failure may benefit from a biventricular pacemaker, which allows for better synchrony of heart contractions.Stevenson WG, Hernaddez AF, Carson PE, et al.

The temple witnessed two terrorist attacks in the year 2002, when Islamic militants attacked it in March and November, with grenades and indulged in indiscriminate firing which resulted in the death of 20 devotees and also in injuries to over 40 people.Amy Waldman (25 November 2002), 10 Killed in Attack on Temple in Kashmir, The New York Times Location The temple complex is located in the old part of the Jammu city north of River Tawi with an average elevation of in Jammu and Kashmir. The city is well connected by road, rail and air services. The National Highway 1 A passes through Jammu and connects with all parts of the country. Jammu city has a railway station called Jammu Tawi, on the northern railway line, that is well connected with major cities of India. Express trains operate from this station to Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Amritsar. Jammu Airport operates flights to many cities in India such as Delhi, Leh and Srinagar. History During the reign of the rulers of Jammu Shivaliks, after 1765, there was a spurt in temple building activity in Jammu area, which continued during the early period of the 19th century. The rulers built spiral shaped temples with brick and crowned each tower with bright Kalashas in the shape of shikhara (rising tower). One such temple complex was started in 1822 (1835 is also mentioned) by Gulab Singh, the ruler of Jammu and was dedicated to his guru Baba Prem Das. Its construction was completed in 1860 by his son Maharaja Ranbir Singh. However, according to an inscription in Brahmic script (Takri) at the entrance of the temple, Gulab Singh and his brother Dhyan Singh are credited with building the temple in 1827 in honour of Mahant Jagannath. =Library and religious school= During the reign of Ranbir Singh, the temple complex started a pathshala (school) which welcomed students from all castes and classes. The temple housed a library with some 6,000 manuscripts. These are mostly copies made from manuscripts not available for sale, in Devanagari from Sarada originals, by scribes employed by the library in the nineteenth century. The library added to its collection, in the 19th century, a dozen rare Sanskrit birch bark codices in the Sarada script as an object of curiosity. The collection as indexed by Stein, included Sanskrit manuscripts (predominantly Devanagari) of Vedic literature, grammar, lexicography, prosody, music, rhetoric, Kavya, drama, fables, dharmasutras, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Jyotisha, Architecture, Medicine, Epics, Puranas, Bhakti and Tantra. Singh funded a translation centre and included an effort to translate texts in Arabic and Persian languages into Sanskrit. According to Zutshi, this inter-religious initiative was praised by his contemporaries. The Raghunath temple remains a significant scholarly source of Sarada script manuscripts and one of the largest collection of Hindu and Buddhist texts of the Kashmir tradition. The Raghunath temple has been an early promoter of digitization initiative of the manuscripts it houses, and has started the eGangotri initiative to digitize ancient manuscripts from other parts of India.eGangotri Manuscript Digital Archive Initiative, Raghunath Temple, Dharmartha Trust Initiative; Sri Rambira Raghunatha Temple Manuscript Library, Jammu, University of Tokyo, Japan Features A view of Shikhara of Raghunath Temple, Jammu, India (1988) The Raghunath temple has seven shrines. The temple complex is dedicated to Raghunath, another name for Rama. The entrance has a Surya icon, another manifestation of Vishnu. It is built over a raised platform of height in an octagonal shape. The front fascia is in width while the main shrine is set away from the entrance. Within the enclosed space of the yard there are residential buildings and open cattle yards on its eastern and northern directions. The front fascia of the temple has three entry doors. The main shrine which is x in size, is surrounded by a circumambulatory passage (pradakshina path) of width. The entrance door, set on one side of this octagonal chamber of the shrine, faces east. The interior of the inner chamber is gold plated. The main walls of the outer chamber have 15 panels, each of height. These interior panels have a surfeit of paintings of the Jammu School of painting consisting of images from the Hindu epics Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita, represented by gods such as Ganesha, Krishna, Sheshashayi Vishnu (reclining Vishnu) and also a large painting depicting the Sita Swayamvara scene (Sita choosing her husband from an elite gathering of princesses). Apart from the mythology related themes, some paintings relate to secular aspects, like Kabir, a saint, engaged in weaving and army personnel of Dogra and Sikh communities. The paintings also reveal the type of attire and the weaponry prevalent during the period of temple building. In the main shrine, the idol of Lord Rama, which is the family deity of the then king and the Dogra people, is deified in the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum). The shrine has a dome instead of the normal shikara in a pyramidal shape, which is in the Sikh architectural style. All the seven shrines have gold plated spires. Gods and Goddesses enshrined in the seven shrines are all related to the epic Ramayana. The shrines are also enshrined with a very large number of Saligramas (fossil ammonite stones specially obtained from the Gandaki river, in Nepal ‚Äì a Vaishnava (Hindu) aniconic representation of Vishnu). A distinct feature noted in the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on the internal and external faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished. Terrorist attacks On 30 March 2002, a terrorist outfit first attacked in the market area by lobbing grenades and then entered the temple where they started firing. The security forces surrounded them. Ten persons, including four security forces personnel and two militants were killed and many more were injured. The second attack took place at the temple on 24 November 2002, when the Hindus were performing puja in the temple; this attack was made by bombers of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and resulted in the deaths of 13 devotees and injuries to over 40.

Their final album, Tragiedia wg Post Regiment (\\"Tragedy According To Post Regiment\\") was released in 1998 on Profane Existence records in the USA and Skuld releases in Europe. It was an album of hardcore punk songs by the Polish band Tragiedia, longtime friends of Post Regiment who broke up without ever putting out a record. Post Regiment had a fairly unusual sound in hardcore punk, with some unusual elements like melodic singing, Eastern European modes, instrumentals and the occasional synthesizer. The band broke up in 2001, although they still practice from time to time. Album Death Before The Metal, released in 2007, contains songs recorded between 1988 and 1990.

It is usually, though not always, generated by a system's graphics chip as the scan lines of a frame are being readied to send to the monitor for display. Such an interrupt provides a mechanism for graphics registers to be changed mid-frame, so they have different values above and below the interrupt point. This allows a single-color object to have multiple, horizontal color bands, for example, or for a sprite to be repositioned to give the illusion that there are more sprites than a system supports. The limitation is that changes only affect the portion of the display below the interrupt. They don't allow more colors or more sprites on a single scan line. Systems supporting raster interrupts Several popular home computers and video game consoles included graphics chips supporting raster interrupts or had features that could be combined to work like raster interrupts. =Bally Astrocade (1977)= =Atari 8-bit family (ANTIC chip, 1979)= The ANTIC chip used by the Atari 8-bit family includes display list interrupts (DLIs), which are triggered as the display is being drawn. The ANTIC chip itself is considerably powerful and inherently capable of many features which other systems require raster interrupts to duplicate. ANTIC can mix multiple graphics modes on the screen, display horizontal and vertical overscan graphics, and fine scroll selected horizontal regions. DLIs on the Atari are typically used to add additional color to the display and reuse Player/Missile graphics elements. =Commodore 64 (MOS Technology VIC-II chip, 1982)= The C64's VIC-II has a flexible raster interrupt system. Raster interrupts and CPU intervention are necessary to reuse sprites on the screen, mix graphics modes, and selectively scroll screen regions. =Nintendo Entertainment System (PPU chip, 1983)= The Nintendo Entertainment System's PPU graphics chip does not support true raster interrupts - an interrupt can be set to trigger during the vertical blank interval, but not at any arbitrary scan line - instead required polling of a \\"hit flag\\" that indicated when the first sprite was being drawn. Although early games like Super Mario Bros., Castlevania, and The Legend of Zelda managed to produce effective split-screen scrolling with this method, it is CPU-intensive. Some later cartridges incorporated MMC circuitry (most prominently Nintendo's MMC3 chip) that kept track of the PPU's address and data lines and generated raster interrupts. =MSX2 (Yamaha V9938, 1985)= MSX2 computers feature a dedicated Yamaha V9938 Video Display Processor (VDP) that, like the NES, supports 'vertical blank interrupts' but requires polling for 'horizontal blank interrupts'. It was commonly used to create split screens, mix multiple video modes together on one screen and to increase the number of unique colours on the screen beyond the official spec. Prominent usage examples are the Aleste series and Konami's Space Manbow. =Commodore Amiga (Copper chip, 1985)= The Amiga computers include a custom coprocessor called the Copper which is dedicated to servicing raster interrupts. The Copper runs a program of simple instructions directing it to wait for a specific vertical scan line and horizontal beam position, then update the contents of a custom chip hardware register. This is typically used for modifying display parameters, such as mixing display modes, reusing sprites, or changing color registers, but can also be used to trigger a CPU interrupt. = Nintendo Game Boy (PPU chip, 1989) = The Game Boy's PPU has support for four raster interrupts : it can be set to trigger at the beginning of a specified scanline, at the end of scanlines (during Horizontal blanking), at the beginning of all scanlines, or at the beginning of Vertical blanking. Its biggest drawback is that the same Interrupt handler is used for the first three, requiring the use of \\"dispatching\\" code if more than one condition is used.

The spelling of his name differs greatly; De la Censerie, Delasencerie, Dela Censerie or Dela Sencerie are the most common alternative forms. His father was a merchant and building contractor from Tournai. Delacenserie studied architecture at the Acad√©mie of his native city under Jean-Brunon Rudd (1792‚Äì1870). He was a laureate of the Prix de Rome in 1862. This prize enabled him to travel to Paris, Italy and Greece where he could admire masterpieces of antique architecture. After his studies he worked for a while in the office of Louis Roelandt, architect to the city of Ghent who worked in the Neo-Classical style. In his early career Delacenserie adopted the Neo-Classical style of his teachers. After he was appointed architect to the city of Bruges he became involved in the Belgian Gothic Revival movement. He led many \\"restorations\\" of the rich Gothic architectural heritage of his native city. This made him familiar with the Gothic brick and sandstone architecture of medieval Flanders. Thanks to his profound knowledge of medieval architecture he was able to imitate this historic style in all its details although he often used new construction techniques and materials in his own original creations. At the pinnacle of his career Delacenserie made the designs for the central station in Antwerp. In this design he made use of a rather eclectic Neo- Renaissance style that refers to the economic and artistic prime of the city in the 16th century. Some aspects of this edifice, like the use of colours and materials, were clearly influenced by Art Nouveau architecture.

Snake worship is devotion to serpent deities. The tradition is present in several ancient cultures, particularly in religion and mythology, where snakes were seen as entities of strength and renewal. Near East =Ancient Mesopotamia= Ancient Mesopotamians and Semites believed that snakes were immortal because they could infinitely shed their skin and appear forever youthful, appearing in a fresh guise every time. The Sumerians worshipped a serpent god named Ningishzida. Before the arrival of the Israelites, snake cults were well established in Canaan in the Bronze Age, for archaeologists have uncovered serpent cult objects in Bronze Age strata at several pre-Israelite cities in Canaan: two at Megiddo,Gordon Loud, Megiddo II: Plates plate 240: 1, 4, from Stratum X (dated by Loud 1650-1550 BC) and Stratum VIIB (dated 1250-1150 BC), noted by Karen Randolph Joines, \\"The Bronze Serpent in the Israelite Cult\\" Journal of Biblical Literature 87.3 (September 1968:245-256) p. 245 note 2. one at Gezer,R.A.S.

Rumailah, Al Ain. = United Arab Emirates = Significant finds of pottery, bronze-ware and even gold depictions of snakes have been made throughout the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Bronze Age and Iron Age metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid has yielded probably the richest trove of such objects, although finds have been made bearing snake symbols in Bronze Age sites at Rumailah, Bithnah and Masafi. Most of the depictions of snakes are similar, with a consistent dotted decoration applied to them. Although the widespread depiction of snakes in sites across the UAE is thought by archaeologists to have a religious purpose, this remains conjecture. =Judaism= =Gnosticism= See Ophites, Naassenes Africa Mami Wata, who plays a major role in various African and African- American religionsJell-Bahlsen 1997, p. 105Chesi 1997, p. 255 In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey, but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the danh-gbi kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. Danh-gbi has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa, but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe. Eva Meyerowitz wrote of an earthenware pot that was stored at the Museum of Achimota College in Gold Coast. The base of the neck of this pot is surrounded by the rainbow snake (Meyerowitz 1940, p. 48). The legend of this creature explains that the rainbow snake only emerged from its home when it was thirsty. Keeping its tail on the ground the snake would raise its head to the sky looking for the rain god. As it drank great quantities of water, the snake would spill some which would fall to the earth as rain (Meyerowitz 1940, p. 48). There are four other snakes on the sides of this pot: Danh ‚Äì gbi, the life giving snake, Li, for protection, Liwui, which was associated with Wu, god of the sea, and Fa, the messenger of the gods (Meyerowitz 1940, p. 48). The first three snakes Danh ‚Äì gbi, Li, Liwui were all worshipped at Whydah, Dahomey where the serpent cult originated (Meyerowitz 1940, p. 48). For the Dahomeans, the spirit of the serpent was one to be feared as he was unforgiving (Nida & Smalley 1959, p. 17). They believed that the serpent spirit could manifest itself in any long, winding objects such as plant roots and animal nerves. They also believed it could manifest itself as the umbilical cord, making it a symbol of fertility and life (Nida & Smalley 1959, p. 17). Mami Wata is a water spirit or class of spirits associated with fertility and healing, usually depicted as a woman holding a large snake or with the lower body of a serpent or fish. She is worshipped in West, Central, and Southern Africa and the African diaspora. =African diasporic religion= In Haitian Vodou, the creator loa Damballa is represented as a serpent, and his wife Ayida-Weddo is called the \\"rainbow serpent.\\"Leah Gordon (1985), page 50-1 The Book of Vodou, Barron's Educational Series . In West African mythology, Ayida-Weddo is believed to hold up the sky.Shannon R. Turlington (2002), page 84 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Voodoo, Pearson Education, Inc .Neil Philip (1999), page 6, Myths and Legends Explained, Dorling Kindersley . Simbi are a type of serpentine loa in Haitian Vodou. They are associated with water and sometimes are believed to act as psychopomps serving Papa Legba. =Ancient Egypt= Ancient Egyptians worshipped snakes, especially the cobra. The cobra was not only associated with the sun god Ra, but also many other deities such as Wadjet, Renenutet, Nehebkau, and Meretseger. Serpents could also be evil and harmful such as the case of Apep. They were also referenced in the Book of the Dead, in which Spell 39 was made to help repel an evil snake in the underworld. \\"Get back! Crawl away! Get away from me, you snake! Go, be drowned in the Lake of the Abyss, at the place where your father commanded that the slaying of you should be carried out.\\" Wadjet was the patron goddess of Upper Egypt, and was represented as a cobra with spread hood, or a cobra-headed woman. She later became one of the protective emblems on the pharaoh's crown once Upper and Lower Egypt were united. She was said to 'spit fire' at the pharaoh's enemies, and the enemies of Ra. Sometimes referred to as one of the eyes of Ra, she was often associated with the lioness goddess Sekhmet, who also bore that role. The Americas =North America= Indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Hopi give reverence to the rattlesnake as grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the Hopi of Arizona, snake-handling figures largely in a dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit). The rattlesnake was worshipped in the Natchez temple of the sun. The Mound Builders evidently reverenced the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, though we are unable to unravel the particular associations. =Mesoamerica= The classic Maya vision serpent, as depicted at Yaxchilan The Maya deity Kukulkan and the Aztec Quetzalcoatl (both meaning \\"feathered serpent\\") figured prominently in their respective cultures of origin. Kukulkan (Q'uq'umatz in K'iche' Maya) is associated with Vision Serpent iconography in Maya art.Mary Miller, Maya Art and Architecture (London: Thames and Hudson, 1999). Kukulkan was an official state deity of Itza in the northern Yucatan.Sharer, Robert J. and Loa P. Traxler, The Ancient Maya (6th ed.). (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006). In many Mesoamerican cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The worship of Quetzalcoatl dates back to as early as the 1st century BC at Teotihuacan.Ringle, William M., Tom√°s Gallareta Negr√≥n, and George J. Bey (1998) \\"The Return of Quetzalcoatl\\". In Ancient Mesoamerica 9(2): 183‚Äì232. In the Postclassic period (AD 900-1519), the cult was centered at Cholula. Quetzalcoatl was associated with wind, the dawn, the planet Venus as the morning star, and was a tutelary patron of arts, crafts, merchants, and the priesthood.Smith, Michael E., The Aztecs (2nd ed.). (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2003). =South America= The Raimondi Stela from the Chav√≠n culture, Ancash, Peru depicts a fanged and clawed figure with snakes for hair. Serpents figure prominently in the art of the pre-Incan Chav√≠n culture, as can be seen at the type-site of Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar in Peru.Richard L. Burger, \\"Chavinntar and its Sphere of Influence\\", In Handbook of South American Archeology, edited by H. Silverman and W. Isbell. (New York: Springer, 2008), pp. 681-706. In Chile the Mapuche mythology featured a serpent figure in stories about a deluge. Lake Guatavita in Colombia also maintains a Cacique legend of a \\"Serpent God\\" living in the waters, which the tribe worshipped by placing gold and silver jewelry into the lake. Asia =Cambodia= Serpents, or nƒÅgas, play a particularly important role in Cambodian mythology. A well-known story explains the emergence of the Khmer people from the union of Indian and indigenous elements, the latter being represented as nƒÅgas. According to the story, an Indian brahmana named Kaundinya came to Cambodia, which at the time was under the dominion of the naga king. The naga princess Soma sallied forth to fight against the invader but was defeated. Presented with the option of marrying the victorious Kaundinya, Soma readily agreed to do so, and together they ruled the land. The Khmer people are their descendants.Chandler, A History of Cambodia, p.13. =India= Manasa in a village in the Sundarbans, West Bengal, India Devotions to Nagadevata Snakes, nagas, have high status in Hindu mythology. ' (Sanskrit:‡§®‡§æ‡§ó) is the Sanskrit and PƒÅli word for a deity or class of entity or being, taking the form of a very large snake, found in Hinduism and Buddhism. The use of the term nƒÅga is often ambiguous, as the word may also refer, in similar contexts, to one of several human tribes known as or nicknamed NƒÅgas; to elephants; and to ordinary snakes, particularly the Ophiophagus hannah, the Ptyas mucosa and the Naja naja, the latter of which is still called nƒÅg in Hindi and other languages of India. A female nƒÅga is a nƒÅgƒ´. The snake primarily represents rebirth, death and mortality, due to its casting of its skin and being symbolically \\"reborn\\". Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras or nagas or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among some Indians, a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess. Naga Temple Kukke Subramanya Swamy temple, Karnataka At one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Rivaan and known as the ‚Äúking of the serpents‚Äù was worshipped. Instead of the \\"king of the serpents\\", actual live snakes were worshipped in Southern India (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, Manasa (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 1). A roadside temple to Snakes, Tamil Nadu, India NƒÅgas form an important part of Hindu mythology. They play prominent roles in various legends: * Shesha (Aadi shesha, Anantha) on whom Vishnu does yoga nidra (Anantha shayana). * Vasuki is the king of Nagas. * Kaliya poisoned the Yamuna river where he lived. Krishna subdued Kaliya and compelled him to leave the river. * Manasa is the queen of the snakes. * Astika is half Brahmin and half naga. * A snake is commonly depicted around Shiva's neck. * Patanjali the great sage and author of the Yoga Sutras was said to be the embodiment of Adi Shesha, the divine serpent who forms Vishu's couch. It was rumored he transformed into a giant snake while teaching his students from behind a screen. * Nag panchami is an important Hindu festival associated with snake worship which takes place of the fifth day of Shravana (July‚ÄìAugust). Snake idols are offered gifts of milk and incense to help the worshipper to gain knowledge, wealth, and fame. Different districts of Bengal celebrate the serpent in various ways. In the districts of East Mymensing, West Sylhet, and North Tippera, serpent-worship rituals were very similar, however (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 5). On the very last day of the Bengali month Shravana, all of these districts celebrate serpent-worship each year (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 5). Regardless of their class and station, every family during this time created a clay model of the serpent-deity ‚Äì usually the serpent-goddess with two snakes spreading their hoods on her shoulders. The people worshipped this model at their homes and sacrificed a goat or a pigeon for the deity's honor (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 5). Before the clay goddess was submerged in water at the end of the festival, the clay snakes were taken from her shoulders. The people believed that the earth these snakes were made from cured illnesses, especially children's diseases (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 6). These districts also worshipped an object known as a Karandi (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 6). Resembling a small house made of cork, the Karandi is decorated with images of snakes, the snake goddess, and snake legends on its walls and roof (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 6). The blood of sacrificed animals was sprinkled on the Karandi and it also was submerged in the river at the end of the festival (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 6). Among the Khasi tribe of Meghalaya, there exists a legend of snake worshipping. The snake deity is called \\"U Thlen\\" (lit: Python or large serpent) and it is said to demand human sacrifice from his worshippers. Those who can provide the Thlen with human blood, are usually rewarded with riches, but he would shame those who cannot provide the needed sacrifice. The subject of the Thlen is still a sensitive subject among the Khasis, and in recent years,in some rural areas, people have been killed in the name of being \\"Nongshohnoh\\" or Keepers of the Thlen, the evil snake God. As kul devata also nagas are worship at many parts of India including Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. In Madhya Pradesh a village Sironja Gadariya in KATNI District people worship naga as a god of their ancestry. They are mainly brahman who worship Shiva also. They are descendants of bharadwaj saga and using Surname Dwivedi. In this village people are worship naga dev in every ceremony like birth, marriage, and any other small and special events. They also claim that even a real serpent mostly cobra living with them but never harm any one. They consider that they are their ancestors who are cursed due to some wrong deeds. Finally another tradition in Hindu culture relating to yoga brings up kundalini, a type of spiritual energy said to sit at the base of the human spine. The term means \\"coiled snake\\" in Sanskrit roots and several goddesses are associated with its vitality, including Adi Parashakti and Bhairavi. = China = Eight dragon kings who assembled at the gathering where Shakyamuni preached the Lotus Sutra, as described in the sutra. Kumarajiva's translation of the Lotus Sutra refers to them by their Sanskrit names: Nanda, Upananda, Sagara, Vasuki, Takshaka, Anavatapta, Manasvin, and Utpalaka. According to the \\"Introduction\\" (first) chapter of the Lotus Sutra, each attends the gathering accompanied by several hundreds of thousands of followers.http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Eight_great_dragon_kings = Korea = In Korean mythology, Eobshin, the wealth goddess, appears as an eared, black snake. Chilseongshin (the Jeju Island equivalent to Eobshin) and her seven daughters are all snakes. These goddesses are deities of orchards, courts, and protect the home. According to the Jeju Pungtorok, \\"The people fear snakes. They worship it as a god...When they see a snake, they call it a great god, and do not kill it or chase it away.\\" The reason for snakes symbolizing worth was because they ate rats and other pests.http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=581047&mobile;&categoryId;=1627 = Japan = Matsura Sayohime (ÊùæÊµ¶‰ΩêÁî®Âß´) was a legendary heroine in Japanese Buddhist mythology. As recounted, she was born to Lord Ky≈çgoku after he and his wife prayed to the Bodhisattva Kannon. After her father's death, Sayohime was too poor to sponsor a memorial service for him; to raise funds, she sold herself to a man named Gonga no Tayu, who (unbeknownst to Sayohime) intended to sacrifice her to the snake deity of his village in place of his own daughter. When presented to the snake, Sayohime read from the Lotus sutra, enabling the deity to achieve enlightenment and shed its monstrous form. The deity then returned Sayohime to the care of her mother. Australia In Australia, Austronesian Australoid religions tell of a huge python, known by a variety of names but universally referred to as the Rainbow Serpent, that was said to have created the landscape, embodied the spirit of fresh water, and punished lawbreakers. The Aboriginal peoples in southwest Australia called the serpent the Waugyl, while the Warramunga of the east coast worshipped the mythical Wollunqua. Europe =Ancient Rome= Serpent worship was well known in ancient Europe. The Roman genius loci took the form of a serpent. In Italy, the Marsian goddess Angitia, whose name derives from the word for \\"serpent,\\" was associated with witches, snakes, and snake-charmers. Angitia is believed to have also been a goddess of healing. Her worship was centered in the Central Apennine region.Emma Dench, From Barbarians to New Men: Greek, Roman, and Modern Perceptions of Peoples from the Central Apennines (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 24, 159. A snake was kept and fed with milk during rites dedicated to Potrimpus, a Prussian god. On the Iberian Peninsula there is evidence that before the introduction of Christianity, and perhaps more strongly before Roman invasions, serpent worship was a standout feature of local religions (see Sugaar). To this day there are numerous traces in European popular belief, especially in Germany, of respect for the snake, possibly a survival of ancestor worship: The \\"house snake\\" cares for the cows and the children, and its appearance is an omen of death; and the lives of a pair of house snakes are often held to be bound with that of the master and the mistress. Tradition states that one of the Gnostic sects known as the Ophites caused a tame serpent to coil around the sacramental bread, and worshipped it as the representative of the Savior. In Lanuvium (32 km from Rome) a big snake was venerated as a god and they offered human sacrifice to it. See Plutarch, Parallela Minora XIV, 309a and Sextus Propertius Elegies IV, 8. Two snakes form a bronze caduceus from the mithycal Longanus river in Sicily =Ancient Greece= Statue of Asclepius in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin Serpents figured prominently in archaic Greek myths. According to some sources, Ophion (\\"serpent\\", a.k.a. Ophioneus), ruled the world with Eurynome before the two of them were cast down by Kronos and Rhea. The oracles of the ancient Greeks were said to have been the continuation of the tradition begun with the worship of the Egyptian cobra goddess, Wadjet. We learn from Herodotus of a great serpent which defended the citadel of Athens. The Minoan Snake Goddess brandished a serpent in either hand, perhaps evoking her role as source of wisdom, rather than her role as Mistress of the Animals (Potnia Theron), with a leopard under each arm. It is not by accident that later the infant Herakles, a liminal hero on the threshold between the old ways and the new Olympian world, also brandished the two serpents that \\"threatened\\" him in his cradle. Although the Classical Greeks were clear that these snakes represented a threat, the snake-brandishing gesture of Herakles is the same as that of the Cretan goddess. Typhon, the enemy of the Olympian gods, is described as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Amongst his children by Echidna are Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane), the serpent-tailed Chimaera, the serpent-like water beast Hydra, and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Herakles. Python, an enemy of Apollo, was always represented in vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Apollo slew Python and made her former home, Delphi, his own oracle. The Pythia took her title from the name Python.Karl Kerenyi The Gods of the Greeks 1951:136. Amphisbaena, a Greek word, from amphis, meaning \\"both ways\\", and bainein, meaning \\"to go\\", also called the \\"Mother of Ants\\", is a mythological, ant- eating serpent with a head at each end. According to Greek mythology, the mythological amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from Medusa the Gorgon's head as Perseus flew over the Libyan Desert with her head in his hand. Medusa and the other Gorgons were vicious female monsters with sharp fangs and hair of living, venomous snakes whose origins predate the written myths of Greece and who were the protectors of the most ancient ritual secrets. The Gorgons wore a belt of two intertwined serpents in the same configuration of the caduceus. The Gorgon was placed at the highest point and central of the relief on the Parthenon. Asclepius, the son of Apollo and Koronis, learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. Asclepius' death at the hands of Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous Aesculapian snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The author of the Bibliotheca claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from the left side of the Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However Euripides wrote in his tragedy Ion that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa's serpents. Zeus placed Asclepius in the sky as the constellation Ophiucus, \\"the Serpent-Bearer\\". The modern symbol of medicine is the rod of Asclepius, a snake twining around a staff, while the symbol of pharmacy is the bowl of Hygieia, a snake twining around a cup or bowl. Hygieia was a daughter of Asclepius. Laoco√∂n was allegedly a priest of Poseidon (or of Apollo, by some accounts) at Troy; he was famous for warning the Trojans in vain against accepting the Trojan Horse from the Greeks, and for his subsequent divine execution. Poseidon (some say Athena), who was supporting the Greeks, subsequently sent sea-serpents to strangle Laoco√∂n and his two sons, Antiphantes and Thymbraeus. Another tradition states that Apollo sent the serpents for an unrelated offense, and only unlucky timing caused the Trojans to misinterpret them as punishment for striking the Horse. Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great and a princess of the primitive land of Epirus, had the reputation of a snake-handler, and it was in serpent form that Zeus was said to have fathered Alexander upon her; tame snakes were still to be found at Macedonian Pella in the 2nd century AD (Lucian, Alexander the false prophet)http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_alexander.htm and at Ostia a bas-relief shows paired coiled serpents flanking a dressed altar, symbols or embodiments of the Lares of the household, worthy of veneration (Veyne 1987 illus p 211). Aeetes, the king of Colchis and father of the sorceress Medea, possessed the Golden Fleece. He guarded it with a massive serpent that never slept. Medea, who had fallen in love with Jason of the Argonauts, enchanted it to sleep so Jason could seize the Fleece. Celtic religion Imbolc was traditionally a time of weather divination, and the old tradition of watching to see if serpents or badgers came from their winter dens may be a forerunner of the North American Groundhog Day. Among other things, the Celtic goddess Brigid was said to be associated with serpents. Her festival day, Imbolc is traditionally a time for weather prognostication based on watching to see if serpents or badgers came from their winter dens. A Scottish Gaelic proverb about the day is: Images File:Naag or serpent.jpgNaag or serpent at Naksaal, Kathmandu File:Nag at Nag pokhari.jpgNag at Nag pokhari, Naksaal, Kathmandu File:naga1.jpgThe Snake God Naga and his consort.The photo is taken at the cave temples clusters of Ajanta, Maharashtra, India File:Naga2 1112111556.jpgKrishna dancing over snake Kaliya at the sand-covered temple ruins in Talakkadu, Karnataka, India.

In July 1941, a full-scale rebellion by the communist Yugoslav Partisans and the royalist Chetniks erupted in the territory. The Germans pressured Milan Nediƒá's collaborationist government to deal with the uprisings under the threat of letting the armed forces of the Independent State of Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria occupy the territory and maintain peace and order in it. It was absorbed in the Waffen-SS in 1944 after evacuating to Slovenia, and in 1945 was rechristened the Serbian SS Corps ( / Srpski SS Korpus; ).  Formation  On 15 September 1941, Nediƒá proposed that the government should be dismissed and allow neighbouring states to police it, but minister Mihailo Olƒáan proposed that the puppet government should call upon the Serbian population to form anti-communist units. The next day 234 members of Yugoslav National Movement (ZBOR), Ljotiƒá's and Olƒáan's pre-war political party enlisted as the first volunteers. On 17 September the Serbian Volunteer Command was formed under the command of Colonel Konstantin Mu≈°icki, a Serbian officer. The command consisted of 12 companies, each 120-150 men strong. Many volunteers came from the student ZBOR organization and others were refugees from the NDH. The men wore olive green uniforms or, in the case of officers, the uniform of the former Yugoslav armed forces, with the Cross of St. George on the right breast. Ranks or grade designations were for all practical purposes those of the former Royal Yugoslav Army. Weapons were mixed; besides German arms which were eventually supplied, foreign rifles and machine guns, especially those seized as war booty from the defeated Yugoslav forces were used. Mortars and light artillery were also on hand in varying quantities. The command also had an educational department whose task was to educate fighters ideologically. The head of the educational section was journalist Ratko Pare≈æanin. It also had an intelligence section which had centres all over Serbia. The spiritual needs of the corps were maintained by protojerej Aleksa Todoroviƒá. The corps often operated in close alliance with the Russian Corps. The Serbian Volunteer Corps was formally under Nediƒá's Command of Gendarmerie, but it was, like SDS and SGS, under direct control of SS and Police Leader August Meyszner and Commanding General in Serbia. In operations in the field, its units were put under tactical command of German divisions. Ljotiƒá himself had no control over SDK. SDK units were not allowed to move from the assigned territory without German authorization.  Uniform  Serbian Volunteer Corps troops received Yugoslav or Italian uniforms on which they wore black cloth collar patches (dark blue after 1943), rank badges on the shoulder straps, and a metal corps badge on the right breast. Their helmets were either Italian or Czechoslovak. Serbian Volunteer Corps being inspected.  Active duty  The volunteers saw their first action on 17 September 1941 in Dra≈æanj village near Grocka, clearing the area of communists with four Yugoslav Partisans and two SDK members killed. In November before an offensive in the Republic of U≈æice Milan Nediƒá ordered that the SDK, Serbian State Guard and Kosta Peƒáanac's Chetniks should be put under joint command. On 22 November a joint military formation called the ≈†umadija Corps was formed under the command of Mu≈°icki. The Corps was put under the command of the German 113th Division with which they fought between 25 and 29 November after the majority of Partisan troops had escaped to the Italian zone. After defeating Partisan troops, the Germans turned to fighting Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks. Konstantin Mu≈°icki informed Mihailoviƒá of the German plans and Mihailoviƒá managed to evade capture. Due to this Mu≈°icki was arrested on 9 December in ƒåaƒçak and replaced by Brigadier Ilija Kukiƒá. Nediƒá intervened to secure Mu≈°icki's release and he was back in command as soon as those Germans that were familiar with the case had left Belgrade at the end of 1942. By 15 February 1942, the Corps had a strength of 172 officers and 3,513 men, which was very close to the planned strength for the five battalions. During 1942 SDK clashed with Partisans in southern Serbia. Although they inflicted considerable losses on the Partisans they didn't manage to crush them completely in southern Serbia. In western Serbia, SDK with gendarmerie, Germans and Chetniks attacked the Kosmaj, Valjevo and Suvobor Partisan battalions who had returned from Bosnia. They managed to defeat all except the Valjevo unit which escaped through enemy lines. At the end of 1942 there were 12 companies in 5 battalions and Germans granted them formal recognition on 1 January 1943, by officially changing its designation to the Serbian Volunteer Corps. In 1943, the SDK clashed with the Partisans near Po≈æarevac, Kru≈°evac, Aranƒëelovac and in Maƒçva. They also clashed with Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks. On 28 September, Chetniks killed Du≈°an Markoviƒá, commander of the 4th volunteer battalion with 20 of his volunteers and soon after Milo≈° Vojnoviƒá Lautner, commander of the 3rd volunteer battalion. On 15 May the Wehrmacht captured 4000 Chetniks under Major Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá in Montenegro. ƒêuri≈°iƒá was to be sent to Strij camp in Poland but managed to escape and was in Belgrade in November that year. ƒêuri≈°iƒá was soon captured by the Gestapo but under guarantees of Nediƒá and Ljotiƒá was released on the condition that he put his troops under SDK command. ƒêuri≈°iƒá accepted the offer, formed three SDK regiments and became Mu≈°icki's second in command. The Partisans had meanwhile grown to an army of considerable strength, and by the summer of 1943 were once again active throughout Serbia. This renewed activity greatly worried the responsible German commanders, since the strength of the occupation forces had declined considerably during the relatively peaceful months of 1942. Nediƒá was also aware of this problem, and went to see Adolf Hitler at Obersalzberg in the hope of finding a solution. The meeting was on 15 September 1943, and Nediƒá managed to secure an agreement for the reinforcement of the SDK by five additional battalions, with a further five to follow as circumstances permitted. These measures were immediately carried out, and by 20 October each of the five independent battalions had become a regiment with a strength of two battalions. Training for the five new battalions took place at the respective regimental garrison locations: SDK 1st Regiment in Valjevo, 2nd Regiment in Kragujevac, 3rd in ≈†abac, 4th in Smederevo, and 5th in Kru≈°evac. Corps headquarters stayed in Belgrade. The SDK fought the Partisans throughout the spring (attacking 2nd and 5th Partisan Divisions in western Serbia) and summer of 1944 (in Toplice and Jablanice) in a number of large operations. On June 21 Milan Nediƒá ordered the formation of the Iron Regiment in Leskovac but during its formation most troops escaped to the Chetniks. By 21 August 1944 the five-regiment SDK had reached a strength of 9,886 officers and men, and from its inception to September 1944 had suffered 700 killed and 1,800 wounded in action.  Retreat and demise  In September the Partisans with Red Army support began their final offensive in Serbia. In mid-September 1944, a corps unit saved Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and the Chetnik Supreme Command in northwest Serbia from capture by the Partisans. The major battle was on 9 September when the Partisans totally defeated joint SDK and Chetnik forces. SDK was in early October given a task to defend the ≈†abac bridgehead and Sava river against Partisans, together with some German units and under the command of Colonel Jungenfeld, the commander of the 5th Police Regiment. On 14 October the battle for Belgrade started, and Germans decided to evacuate SDK to some place where it can be used in guarding duties and anti-partisan actions, since SDK was considered unsuitable for full frontal combat. Hitler ordered to move SDK to Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, and to put it under Higher SS and Police Leader of OZAK, under Commander in Chief South-West. Army Group F Commander ordered boarding of SDK for the evacuation on 17 October on railway station Ruma, as the clearance from High Command of the South-West was received for transport on 19‚Äì21 October. On its new position SDK participated in anti-Partisan operations. The withdrawal began on 8 October during the final joint Partisan and Soviet assault on Belgrade when the 1st volunteer regiment under Major Ilija Miƒáa≈°eviƒá and 4th volunteer regiment under Major Vojislav Dimitrijeviƒá crossed the Sava river. The 3rd regiment under Major Jovan Dobrosavljeviƒá delayed crossing the Sava as they were fighting the Partisans in ≈†abac and met up with the others later in Ruma. The 2nd Regiment under Major Marisav Petroviƒá crossed the Sava near Obrenovac. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 5th Regiment were still on the ground. When they reached Ni≈° they learned that the Red Army had taken Aleksinac and their way to Belgrade was blocked. The commander of 5th Regiment was forced to change the withdrawal plan and moved across the Ra≈°ka mountains with the Wehrmacht towards Bosnia. The 1st Battalion of 5th Regiment under Captain Vasa Ogrizoviƒá held Zajeƒçar but as soon as the Russians crossed the Danube they moved to Belgrade and crossed the Sava and they became a temporary part of the 4th Regiment. Most troops met each other at Sremska Mitrovica where they awaited trains for transfer to Slovenia. Meanwhile, major changes in Berlin affected many non- German volunteers fighting with German forces. There was a branch-of-service redistribution by ethnic group, and the Serbian volunteers now found themselves under the authority of the Waffen-SS. The order effecting the transfer was dated 9 November, but not formally recognized until 27 November. At this time the SDK composition on paper was a corps staff, five regiments each with three battalions, a signal company, a mountain supply detachment and German liaison staff. It is important to point out at this time that the SDK's relationship with the Waffen-SS was official, but not on the ground. The troops never wore SS uniforms, and it is doubtful whether the relationship ever went beyond the simple exchange of a limited amount of paperwork. The SDK's situation was quite similar to that of the XV. Kosaken-Kavallerie-Korps, which was also absorbed into the Waffen-SS at about the same time. As they reached Slovenia the SDK troops concentrated in the area around Ilirska Bistrica and Postojna with command being set up in Ilirska Bistrica. As soon as he arrived in Slovenia Dimitrije Ljotiƒá got in touch with pro-Nazi Slovenian Domobranci commander Leon Rupnik and Bishop of Ljubljana Gregorij Ro≈æman and agreed on mutual help and co-operation. SDK established volunteer schools in Ilirska Bistrica, one for officer training and one ideological. The school for officers was directed by Ljotiƒá himself. During the settling in period, the 3,000 able-bodied survivors of the SDK were augmented by released Serbian POWs, Chetniks, and members of the Serbian State Guard who had been evacuated to Istria. These new additions brought the unit's strength to approximately 8,000. Lika Chetnik Corps and Slovenian Chetniks called Plava Garda ('Blue Guard') were also present in Slovenia and they also joined the Nationalist front. Nationalist formations in Slovenia numbered about 40,000 armed men in total. The part of 5th Regiment that withdrew reached Bosnia in mid-November and began to move towards Slovenia. It was during the move north that an event befell the SDK which was to cripple the unit's leadership capability in the coming months. 30 to 40 officers were seized in Zagreb by the Croatian Usta≈°e and executed. The Usta≈°e considered them dangerous enemies of the NDH, and this was the Usta≈°e response to the German failure to obtain permission prior to transporting these Serbs through their country. Any Serb who supported the 'Greater Serbia' concept, as did Ljotiƒá and his followers, was by definition an enemy of Paveliƒá's Croatia. SDK's first major action in Slovenia was to take the Partisan-held Kras village of Col on 18 December 1944. From 19 December to the end of the month a major encircle-and-destroy operation was mounted from the garrison towns of Gorizia, Idrija, Postojna and Se≈æana aiming to eliminate the Partisan stronghold in the Trnovska Mountains. Nearly 5,000 men were used, including 500 from the SDK's 1st Regiment in Postojna, the 10th SS-Police Regiment, Italian R.S.I. troops, Slovenian Domobranci (pro-Nazi Slovenian militia). The next campaign participated in by the SDK was against Josip Broz Tito's 9th Corps during the first few days of March 1945 and codenamed Ruebezahl. Two combat groups were formed to strike against Partisan concentrations near Lokve. The first group was called 'Zuschneid', and comprised three SS-Police battalions, elements of the 1st Slovenian Domobranci Assault Regiment, two SDK battalions and one Caucasian battalion, with a total force of around 5,000 men. The second group, 'Koestermann', consisted of two battalions of the German 730th Infantry Regiment (710th Inf. Div.), a police company and some engineers, with a total of 2,500 men. The attacking forces pushed forward from a south and west direction, and this time the operation was more successful. The Partisans suffered moderate losses, and the concentration was broken up and dispersed to the northeast. However, the Partisans quickly regrouped, so the Germans were forced to conduct a supplementary operation (19 March-7 April), which proved to be the final operation against Tito's 9th Corps. Four combat groups were organized along the perimeter of the area now occupied by the Partisans, with the task of bringing the 9th Corps to battle by gradually advancing in unison toward the centre, and thereby reducing the size of the area under their control. This was the standard German method of cleansing a Partisan- controlled area, that never significantly changed during the course of the war. To the west, along a line Idrija-Rijeka-Grahovo-Podbrdo, Combat Group Blank was assembled with major elements of the 10th and 15th SS-Police Regiments, II./1. SDK Rgt, II./4. SDK Rgt, 21st SS-Police Reconnaissance Co., SS-Police Company 'Schmidt' and an artillery battery from the LXXXXVII Army Corps. This force was later joined on 4 April by the 2nd and 3rd SDK Regiments, and 1,500 men from the Chetnik 502 Lika Corps. The second group, under Police Major Dr Dippelhofer, consisted of the Ljubljana SS NCO School, Slovenian Domobranci, Chetniks and a 1,200-man Russian ROA unit. This group was deployed to the southeast along the line Idrija-≈†kofja Loka. The northern assault group, 4,500 men from the 13th, 17th and 28th SS-Police Regiments formed up along the road between Podbrdo and ≈†kofja Loka, while a special assault force from the 14th SS Division was concentrated along the north- eastern side of the perimeter. The area encircled was mountainous, thickly forested, and still deep in winter snow. Once off the few roads that encircle the area, the attacking forces were faced with extremely difficult terrain that limited their progress to a few kilometres each day, inhibited contact with neighbouring units, and greatly restricted the ability to rapidly bring up fresh supplies and heavy weapons. Very soon gaps developed in the line of advance, through which the main body of 9th Corps escaped. Although a number of minor skirmishes were fought, and casualties suffered on both sides, the overall result of the operation was disappointing. On 27 March, General Damjanoviƒá replaced General Mu≈°icki as commander of the Serbian Volunteer Corps and the SDK became a component of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá‚Äôs Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, the formal name for the Chetnik forces, although the Corps was still assigned to the HSSuPF Trieste under SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Odilo Globocnik. Whether this change affected the SDK's relationship to the Waffen-SS is unknown, but doubtful. Shortly thereafter, Hermann Neubacher, Hitler's special political representative for the Balkans, paid a visit to Ljotiƒá in Trieste to discuss German fears about what would happen when the SDK and Chetnik forces in Istria came into contact with British and American units who were expected to move in that direction from Italy. Ljotiƒá reassured Neubacher of the SDK's loyalty. Meanwhile, Tito's 4th Partisan Army was advancing north along the coastal road from Novi Vinodolski, Croatia to liberate Istria, Trieste and all of central and western Slovenia. German Army Group E immediately issued orders to the LXXXXVII Army Corps to build a perimeter around the port city of Rijeka, to try to block the 4th Army's westward advance. In early April the 237th Infantry Division was rushed to the area, and within a few days defensive positions were established in a 21-kilometre arc to the east and north of the city. The 4th Army began its attack on Rijeka around 20 April with the Partisan 13th, 19th and 43rd Divisions. Although the outnumbered German 237th Infantry Division offered stiff resistance and held its positions, General Kuebler ordered the 188th Reserve Mountain Division to launch an immediate attack on Partisan concentrations in the vicinity of Grobnik Airfield, 16 kilometres north east of Rijeka. To support this attack, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th SDK Regiments were moved up from the Postojna area. However the regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps arrived too late and never made contact with the 188th Mountain Division. The attack on the airfield was unsuccessful, and by 23 April it was clear to General Kuebler that his Corps was threatened with total encirclement. Kuebler's appreciation of the situation was entirely correct, as on 22 April the general staff of Tito's 4th Army ordered a flanking movement to bypass the city. While the LXXXXVII Corps continued to be pressed by three divisions, the Partisan 20th Division was brought up from Ogulin along with one additional brigade, three tank battalions and two artillery battalions. This force moved to the north, around the German defensive perimeter, and advanced on Trieste via Ilirska Bistrica with the intention of linking up with the Partisan 9th Corps which was pushing south on Trieste. As the battle for Rijeka moved toward its inevitable conclusion, SDK Regiments 2, 3, and 4 were sent to Ljubljana and transferred to the authority of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Erwin R√∂sener, HSSuPF for Carinthia, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of Army Group E's rear area. R√∂sener's task was to open up and keep open the road and rail routes in northern Slovenia to facilitate the Army Group's withdrawal from Croatia north into Austria. SDK Regiments 1 and 5 remained assigned to Globocnik, who had meanwhile transferred his headquarters from Trieste to Udine, across the Isonzo River in Italy. The SDK was therefore split into two groups, one in central Slovenia under R√∂sener and moving toward the Austrian border, while the other was in the extreme western part of Slovenia under Globoƒçnik moving toward Italy.  Surrender and afterwards  At about this time, 22 April, Neubacher paid his final visit to Ljotiƒá. A total collapse of German forces in the Balkans and in Italy was recognized as being only a matter of weeks if not days away, and Neubacher wanted to know Ljotiƒá's plans for withdrawing and surrendering the SDK. The next day, during the hours of darkness, Ljotiƒá accidentally drove his car into a hole that had been blown in a bridge by Allied fighter-bombers. His neck was broken and he died shortly thereafter. On 29 April, as Tito's forces were closing on the Trieste area, General Damjanoviƒá issued orders to the 1st and 5th Regiments to cross into Italy, where on 5 May in the town of Palmanova (50 km northwest of Trieste) between 2,400 and 2,800 SDK men surrendered to the British. The men belonging to the other three regiments experienced a less agreeable fate. They moved north from the Ljubljana area into Austria and surrendered to the British at Unterbergen on the Drava River on 12 May 1945. 20 days later these 2,418 men were turned over to Tito's Partisans. Some were executed almost immediately in the Koƒçevski Rog massacre, while the others were carted off along with 10,000 Slovenian Domobranci to the infamous ≈†entvid camp, near Ljubljana. Subsequently, these too were executed. The group that surrendered in Italy was eventually transported to a camp at M√ºnster, Germany, where they were released in July, 1947. These men made their way to various countries around the world, including the United States. General Mu≈°icki was arrested by the Allied authorities, returned to Yugoslavia, and executed in 1946 as a result of sentences passed at the same war crimes trial that pronounced the death sentence on Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and a number of others.

Club career Born in Rijswijk, Knopper began his career with Feyenoord but, still in his youth, moved to rivals AFC Ajax, making his official debut in November 1997 against Sparta Rotterdam. In 1999, he was voted by club supporters as Most Talented Player, receiving the Marco van Basten Trophy; the following year he scored 15 Eredivisie goals as a midfielder, but his team could only finish fifth. A regular under Jan Wouters, Knopper saw his playing time reduce when Co Adriaanse took over as head coach in 2000. He was sidelined with injury for almost the entire season, playing only eight matches that year and appearing slightly more in the following, which would be his last. In May 2002, Knopper had a trial with Premier League side Sunderland and played in that predicament in the testimonial match for Niall Quinn with the Republic of Ireland on the 14th. From 2002 to 2004 he served two loans, first with Greece's Aris Thessaloniki F.C. then with SC Heerenveen, slightly reviving his career with the latter; upon his Ajax release in summer 2004, he spent two additional campaigns with Vitesse Arnhem, appearing regularly. After some problems with Vitesse manager Aad de Mos, Knopper was forced to leave and joined ADO Den Haag. In July 2007 a three-year contract was agreed, with the player netting again in double figures (ten) in 2008‚Äì09, crucial to help in a narrow escape from relegation; in the 2010 summer, aged 33, he was released. In January 2011, Knopper moved to Liga Primer Indonesia club PSM Makassar, leaving after a couple of months and signing with lowly Haaglandia back in his country, where he ended his career.

He is part of a tradition of Yorkshire wicket-keepers, stretching from Ned Stephenson, George Pinder, Joe Hunter and David Hunter before him, to Arthur Wood, Jimmy Binks, David Bairstow plus Richard Blakey to the present day. The successor to David Hunter as Yorkshire's wicket-keeper he served the county for twenty two years. He also played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Career Dolphin was born in Wilsden, Bingley, Yorkshire, England, and became the first Bradford League player chosen to represent Yorkshire. Dolphin was 14 years old when he first played for Wilsden Britannia, and 19 when he made his county debut in 1905. After playing for the Yorkshire Second XI, he took over as Yorkshire's first choice wicket keeper in 1910, and retained his position for seventeen years. He served in World War I alongside his county colleagues, Roy Kilner and Major Booth, with the Leeds Pals but returned to Yorkshire's ranks in 1919, and enjoyed his most successful season with the gloves claiming 82 dismissals in the first post-war summer. Dolphin could defend with the bat when needed, as exemplified by his vigil against Essex at Leyton in 1919. He scored 62 not out, and with E. Smith put on 103 for the last wicket, so saving their side from following-on when Yorkshire were in danger of doing so. He had previous form against Essex in 1914, going into bat as the nightwatchman, he added 124 for the second wicket with Benjamin Wilson. His one Test match came in 1920‚Äì21 in the Fourth Test against Australia. He was remarkably consistent once he had won his first team place, but when he was injured it came about in unusual circumstances. Playing against Middlesex at Lord's, he fell off a chair in the dressing-room as he reached for his clothes and broke his wrist, missing the remainder of the summer of 1921. His benefit match in 1922 against Kent at Headingley, Leeds raised ¬£1,891 and he hit the winning runs, after scoring 20 of the 24 required to win, to secure victory by ten wickets. He suffered from sciatica in the latter part of his career, and he played his last match for Yorkshire in 1927. Herbert Sutcliffe observed Dolphin and wrote: \\"His quick brain and exceptionally keen eyesight were responsible for disposing of large numbers of batsmen from chances which many keepers would have missed without even affecting their reputations\\". Nearly a third of Dolphin's dismissals were stumpings. After retiring as a player, Dolphin became an umpire for a decade and officiated in six Tests. Dolphin died in Lilycroft, Heaton, Bradford, Yorkshire, at the age of 56 in October 1942.

It is situated atop a hill in downtown Beirut a few blocks away from the Lebanese Parliament building. The Grand Serail is a historic building, the most important of three Ottoman monuments on the Serail hill. The other two are the Council for Development and Reconstruction and the Hamidiyyeh clock tower. This historic building has earned its importance through successive roles which it held since 1832 History =The Barracks= Aerial view of the Serail hill After its short-lived victory over the Ottomans in 1831, an Egyptian military contingent took position and set up its barracks on the western side of a hill overlooking Beirut and outside its walls. Ibrahim Pasha selected this hill for military reasons. It was a high hill overlooking Suq-al Munajjidin (the weavers' bazaar), this Suq, known today as the banks street (shari' al Massarif), was located on a strategic area within downtown Beirut, and close to Tal'at al American (American Hill), near Bab Yaacub (Jacob's Gate). In his book \\"Taqwim al Ikbal\\" Sheik Abdel Basit al Unsi describes that hill as being well situated, west of the city, away from the population and overseeing the sea and Beirut. Thus because of its situation, it allows the contingent to control the city and its suburbs. While the Egyptians were on that hill, the people customarily referred to it as the \\"Al Thakanat\\" (the barracks) because it was the lodging place that was selected by Ibrahim Pasha for his troops. =The Garrison= North gate In 1840, the Ottoman Empire with the support of the Prussian, Russian, and English navies, recaptured authority over Syria. The Ottoman military authority took interest in the hill overlooking Beirut and set up a military base there. The building was first used as the headquarters of military and civilian departments and then, after its expansion, it turned into the headquarters of Ottoman governors. Beirutis referred to it then as al Quishleh (modern ), a Turkish word for \\"Garrison\\" or \\"soldiers quarter\\". Construction and fortification of the barracks was started in 1853 and was further expanded during the Crimean war. Until 1856 the Grand Serail only consisted of a single floor, another floor was added and the ground floor then served as the cavalry stables. Between 1877 and 1894 major structural modifications were made which gave the Serail its final form. =The Hospital and the Courthouse= Sultan Abd√ºlaziz (ruled 1861‚Äì1876) ordered the building of a hospital (Hastahane in Turkish, usually shortened to Hastane in current modern Turkish), which was built in 1865, people referred to it as the military infirmary. The hospital building included two wings. Its northern wing housed a drugstore (ajzah). When the French entered the city in 1918, they turned the hospital into a courthouse. Later the courthouse was moved to another location and the building became the Institute of Fine Art of the Lebanese University. however the war that raged through Beirut destroyed most parts of the courthouse and turned them into ruins until prime minister Rafik Hariri donated the sum needed for its reconstruction and renovation. Since its inauguration in 1992, the building serves as the headquarters of the Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction. =The Hamidiyyeh Clock Tower= In 1897, a clock towerSimilar towers were built in numerous other cities of the Ottoman Empire, such as Istanbul, Izmir, Izmit, Adana, Jaffa, Nablus, Acre and Tripoli. was built near the Grand Serail to celebrate the anniversary of Sultan Abdul Hamid II's coronation and to make up for the absence of a public clock indicating mandatory Muslim prayer times especially that many foreign institutions had built western style clock towers. The construction of the clock tower was approved by the Sultan following a letter of supplication from Beirut's governor Rashid Bey. The ceremonial laying of the first stone took place on 9 January 1897 (the birthday of the Sultan) in the presence of high officials, military representatives and members of the municipality of Beirut. =The High Commission= In 1918 after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World war one, the Flag of the Arab Revolt was briefly hoisted over the Grand Serail until the arrival of the allied forces who entered Lebanon by land and from the sea and occupied Beirut and the entire Lebanese coast on 8 October 1918. French colonel Depiepape was appointed by the commander of the allied forces General Allenby, he took control of the grand Serail and became the military governor of the country. With the removal of the Flag of the Arab Revolt, the Grand Serail was turned into the headquarters of the French Governor, who was granted the title of high commissioner of the French Government in the Levant. From then on the Grand Serail was referred to as the High Commission. In 1926 the French introduced changes to the northern facade of the Grand Serail. Thus a lobed arch balcony above the decorated entrance replaced the northern arched gate, which was moved to the southern entrance. The new balcony became a loggia for high commissioners and prime ministers' speeches. The French also removed a crown from over the arch of the northern entrance because it contained an engraved marble tablet showing the symbol of the Ottoman Empire. =The Presidential Headquarters= Sheik Bechara El Khoury, who was the first post-independence President of Lebanon, holding office from 21 September 1943 to 18 September 1952, turned the Serail into the presidential headquarters before moving it to the Qantari Palace in Beirut. =The Prime Minister's Headquarters= The Grand Serail became the headquarters of the Lebanese prime minister Riad as- Solh who was the first Prime Minister of Lebanon (1943‚Äì1945), after the country's independence and has been used as the Office of the president of the council of ministers headquarters ever since. The 2020 Beirut explosions occurred about away from the palace, which sustained some damage.https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/lebanon-beirut-explosion-live- updates-dle-intl/h_f74c8dd044670466207c66abc8165f86 Prime Minister Hassan Diab's wife and daughter sustained minor injuries, while his health advisor, Petra Khoury, was taken from the palace to the hospital for cuts that required stitching.https://www.arabnews.com/node/1714831/middle-east Architecture and Renovation File:High serail.jpgHaut Commissariat File:La_place_avec.jpgThe square beneath the Serail =The Grand Serail= Hamidiyyeh Clock Tower The Grand Serail followed the architectural design epitomizing the new Ottoman military organization known as the \\"New Order\\" (ni·∫ìƒÅm cedƒ´d). Its elevated location and austere fa√ßade copied the Selimiye Barracks in Istanbul. The finished structure consisted of two tall floors with the longer fa√ßade spreading over . The eastern fa√ßade is adorned by an arcaded protruding portico flanked by two symmetrical wings each divided by three rows of 16 windows. The monumentality of the building was further emphasized in 1861 when the military hospital was constructed. Particularly hit during the civil war, the Serail was a scarred site at the end of the hostilities. Its renovation to its present state of grandeur is a symbol of the vision and challenge involved in the BCD reconstruction. Restoration was completed in 900 work daysThe Grand Serail ‚Äì Quarterly in 1998. Today, the Grand Serail is a blend of heritage architecture with a modern interior and high-tech amenities. A faithful adaptation of the original Ottoman structure resulted in a larger, more functional building. The external walls were completely restored and stone from demolished buildings was used in the additional floor, thereby preserving a homogeneous facade. All contracting and handicrafts, including stone, marble, steel or carpentry works, were carried out by Lebanese firms. The Serail covers 39,700 sq. m of floor space. The Grand Serail's four wings are disposed around a large courtyard which flanked at the center by a limestone and Carrera marble fountain. Both the exterior and interior facades are covered by a total of 588 arches and arcades (282 lobes arches, 197 pointed arches, 6 rounded arches, 11 mandolin arches, 92 pointed arcades). The north gate is constitutes the central structural element of the four facades. It is high and in width and was inspired by the Beiteddine Palace's gates. In the middle of entrance's arch a marble tablet was inscribed under the request of prime minister Rafik Hariri which reads: \\"ŸÑŸà ÿØÿßŸÖÿ™ ŸÑÿ∫Ÿäÿ±ŸÉ ŸÑŸÖÿß ÿßÿ™ÿµŸÑÿ™ ÿ•ŸÑŸäŸÉ \\" which vaguely translates:\\"If _political_ rule lasts perpetually for anyone, it would not have reached you\\". The two upper floors comprise the Prime Minister's residence and office, offices for his staff, as well as the cabinet room and ministers' offices. The ground floor consists of a banquet hall, two receptions areas, a press room and a courtyard. Finally, an underground level includes a car-park, offices and rooms for the personnel. In all the Grand Serail includes 430 rooms and chambers in addition to the quarters for the maintenance and other service rooms. =The Hamidiyyeh Clock Tower= The Hamidiyyah Clock Tower was designed by Youssef Aftimus, and restored in 1994 to its original condition. The Clock Tower stands tall, it was the tallest structure in Beirut at the time of its completion. It was built of Beiruti sandstone, Jounieh limestone, Damascene Basalt and Deir el Qamar red stone. The clock tower's 300 kg bell, suspended on the third floor was accessible by a set of 125 cast iron steps inside the tower's 4 by shaft. This floor has four miniature neo-orientalist style balconies topped by the four large French made clock faces which were especially imported by the Ottoman embassy.

Born in South Dakota, he was a 1904 graduate of Yankton College. He taught at Nebraska's Weeping Water Academy before enrolling at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for graduate studies in political economy. In the fall of 1907 he joined with his professor, John R. Commons, on a trip to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to begin work with dozens of other progressives on an ambitious sociological study: Paul Kellogg's Pittsburgh Survey, funded by the Russell Sage Foundation. Fitch spent more than a year interviewing steel workers. The resulting book, The Steel Workers, was published in 1910, one of the Survey's six published volumes. It remains a classic depiction of a key industry in early twentieth-century America. Fitch, after a brief stint working for the New York Department of Labor, was an editor and writer for Paul Kellogg's Survey, America's leading social work journal. Beginning in 1917 Fitch taught labor relations as a professor at the New York School of Social Work, where he retired in 1946.

The series first aired in 1993 and ended in 1997. Summary The series focused on a fictional football team headed by the heiress of the teams' legacy, Amanda Carey, and their coach, Jock Stone. During the series, the Hurricanes football team would either be battling a renegade football club, the Gorgons, managed by Stavros Garkos, for pitch supremacy, or having wild, unpredictable adventures off the field in exotic world touring locations. Despite such a lengthy episode number, and a cult following among British football fans who watched it faithfully in reruns during the football seasons, the Hurricanes remained a fairly dormant and minor addition to BKN's library, and its impact worldwide is particularly small, its most memorable aspect being its theme song (\\"We're the Hurricanes\\"). The programme had been aired in weekly first-run syndication in the United States in the late 1990s, though it did not see mainstream broadcasting until the fall of 2012 when Cookie Jar Entertainment (whom DIC had merged with), which had re-acquired the rights to the show from BKN through a bankruptcy in 2010, added the program to the weekday Cookie Jar-controlled This Is for Kids lineup on the This TV digital subchannel network. In 2015, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh began re-airing the show daily and also added the programme to the STV Player.

Carey is involved with the management of her football team rather than hiring another manager or selling the team. Unlike Stavros Garkos, Carey always respects the integrity of the game and believes in fair play. She owns a Scottish Terrier named Dribble, who serves as one of the team's mascots. Jock Stone: The wise, no-nonsense Scottish head coach of the Hurricanes, notably based on Celtic F.C. manager Jock Stein. His main priority is football, and he's so strict that he tends to be upset when the team is late for or skips out on his training. Cal Casey: The Hurricanes' team captain from the United States. If the team faces a problem outside of football or if the Gorgons are up to no good, Cal is usually there to help set things right. Plato Qui√±ones: A naive Brazilian who believes in superstitions like vampires, and apparently has a heart for animals. He is often seen barefooted, and plays this way (which is not allowed in professional competitions in real life). In the episode \\"Go Ape!\\", Plato smuggled a monkey he named Topper into stadium. The monkey ended up becoming Plato's pet and one of the team's mascots. Napper Thompson: An Englishman who enjoys poetry and sci-fi stories. He tends to get into more strange situations than the others. In \\"Traitor\\", Garkos had a transmitter unknowingly put in his filling so he could steal secrets from the Hurricanes. In \\"Lord Napper of Stepney\\", Napper inherited his uncle's fortune on the condition he never plays football ever again. In \\"The Great Defensive Wall of China\\", a cult saw Napper as \\"The One\\". Napper is usually seen hanging out with Cal. Helmut and Jorg Beethoven: German twins who, despite being confident in their abilities as the team's strikers, often feud with each other. Helmut is slimmer, taller and insists on being the driver of the team bus. Jorg is shorter, more muscular and wears a distinctive headband. \\"Stats\\" Hiro: The team's right-midfielder hailing from Japan. The smallest of all team members, he is known for his agility. He is very intelligent too, and mechanically inclined creating a flying camera called the Flying Eye and a high-tech 'computer-bot' called MATT (Multimedia Analysis and Training Toolkit). In \\"Team Spirit\\", he injured his leg and was replaced in the Hurricanes' game against the Eagles with Little Bear. Dino Allegro: The Italian goalie of the team. Dino has a picture of his brother, which he keeps in his bag as a lucky charm to look at before every match. When Garkos discovered this, he had Rebo steal it, crushing his confidence. It took a visit from his brother to get his head back in the game. He is also afraid of space and flying in a space shuttle. Oliver \\"Rude\\" Marley: A Jamaican football player known for his rude attitude, hence his nickname. He was a high school drop-out, until \\"Marley in Chains\\" where he gets his high school certificate after encouragement from Napper, who also didn't finish school. Georgie Wright: An English footballer who always calls the coin toss at the start of the match. He cannot swim and is afraid or large bodies of water because of it. Papillon: The team's talented French striker with a one-word name similar to Pel√©. He has an eye for the ladies and possesses an overall suave personality. He also likes driving fast cars and racing. Toro Contrais: A bulky Spanish centre-back who is slightly overconfident on the field. In \\"Toro\\", he is revealed to be afraid of cats. When Jock temporarily suspended him, Toro became a pro-wrestler named \\"The Masked Matador\\". Andy Stone: Son of Jock Stone, Andy is the team's physician. He created a revolutionary cold- compress which he used in a game against the Zebras. =The Garkos Gorgons= The Gorgons are a team of violent players who usually utilize illegal tactics inside or outside the field. Their headquarters is inside a volcano in the Island of Garkos. The team includes: Stavros Garkos: The main villain of the show, he is the owner of the Garkos Gorgons, a football team composed of thugs who often use dirty tricks not only to defeat the Hurricanes, but also assist Garkos in his other dirty schemes. He runs Garkos Enterprises and is known for using the name Medusa as a pseudonym for some of his companies and breaking his Medusa-head staff whenever angered. Stavros Garkos is the most persistent of the villains in Hurricanes. In most of his appearances, he tries to steal the Hurricanes' status as world's greatest football team and/or make large sums of money. Garkos' interests also include damaging the Hurricanes' image (even when he doesn't seem to gain anything from this) and his attempts at 'proving' football is a Greek sport. Stavros Garkos holds many companies around the world, all of which are part of his own Garkos Enterprises. Garkos also owns an unnamed insurance company that covers the Medusa Network satellite. Garkos Enterprises also has an office in London, even though it was unclear which kind of activities he develops there. Wyn Smithe and Genghis Khan: The Gorgons' two best players, they also serve as Stavros Garkos' right- hand men enlisted to assist him with his schemes. It is rare to see the Gorgons playing without them both, except through injury, and even rarer to see one of them appearing in an episode without the other. One instance of this occurring is in \\"When Hurricanes Collide\\", when Genghis appeared but Wyn did not. Even though Garkos favours them, they have little loyalty in return; they once attempted to steal a gold mine so as to be able to stop working for Garkos. Rebo: Rebo's biggest role in Stavros Garkos's dirty schemes was in \\"Blood Match\\", when Rebo stole Dino Allegro's lucky charm, damaging his abilities as the Hurricanes's main goalkeeper. He also makes a cameo where he assisted Wyn and Genghis in an attempt to prevent the Hurricanes from arriving for a fundraising game in Inverfinnan Park, home to Jock Stone's former team Inverfinnan Celtics, so Garkos could buy it. Most of Rebo's other appearances is simply playing football. Benny the Viking: An unpopular Swedish football player who is hated by fellow footballers in his home country for his dirty play. Stavros Garkos tried to revert it by hiring a publicist who put Benny to compete against Cal Casey on a game show, only for Casey to defeat Benny and teach him the value of good sportsmanship. A lesson that he only practices at his home country, this enhances his popularity for a price Stavros Garkos didn't like to pay. Lobo: Lobo was once nominated for the title of Spain's best football player. His rival for the title was the Hurricanes' own Toro. To help his player get the title, Garkos kidnapped Toro's sister, Maria, as part of a plan to ruin his popularity. =The Garkos Family= Stavros Garkos sometimes enlists the help of some relatives for some dirty tactics. Here are some of them: Spiro Garkos: Stavros' brother. Spiro is nowhere to be seen without a uniform, and on his very first appearance, he's called \\"mister-in- charge-of-everything\\" by Amanda Carey. What could be noticed from his first appearance in \\"Stowaway\\", when he was revealed to be the coach of the Gorgons' Youth Team, the Police Chief of the Island of Garkos and the head of Child Welfare. In \\"Around the World in 90 Minutes\\", Spiro is the admiral of the Garkos Navy and helped his brother take over the aircraft carrier the Hurricanes were using to play football at sea. He also makes a cameo appearance in \\"There's Only One Jock Stone\\" as captain of Stavros Garkos's cruise ship. Melinda Garkos: Stavros' sister. Melinda helps her brother in anything he wants to, no matter how low she has to get. Her low acts include making people ruined by Stavros Garkos sell their homes to him (\\"Water, Water, Everywhere\\"), stealing artifacts from an Egyptian pyramids (\\"Serpents of the Nile\\"), passing herself as the legendary Medusa (\\"The Curse of the Gorgon\\"), and helping the Gorgons forge evidence to blackmail the referee (\\"Dino's Snapshot\\"). Irena Bole: Stavros' niece. Stavros Garkos had a scheme involving a childhood friend of Cal Casey. This friend had criminal records and is now a goalkeeper for the L.A. Lasers. Irena only agreed to help her uncle in exchange of becoming the first female vice-president of Garkos Enterprises. When the plan failed, Garkos says he wouldn't hire her even as a coffee-lady. Since she's single (she's called Ms.) and doesn't bear the name Garkos, it can be assumed that Spiro and Melinda aren't Stavros Garkos's only siblings. Stavros Garkos IV: Stavros' namesake and look-alike great-grandson from the future, only appearing in \\"The Relegator\\". Stavros Garkos had mortgaged all his assets to bet against the Hurricanes and lost. Because of that, all Stavros IV inherited was his football team. To revert this situation, Stavros IV sent a robot player named The Relegator to change the game results. Stavros Garkos was reluctant about this because he couldn't have a great-grandson for not even having grandchildren, as he stated, but he started believing when the bet (something he never expected to meet someone who already knew about) was mentioned. For a final test, Garkos asked the Relegator what he thinks about rules, and he said they must be broken, this making Stavros believe he's been sent by Garkos. The robot failed and the Plan B destroyed a factory, forcing Garkos to pay for the damages, creating an alternate future where Stavros IV washes the Hurricanes' uniforms. Since this was a dream of Napper Thompson, it doesn't affect the continuity of the series. Even then, this strongly implies that Stavros Garkos is a father of at least one child. =Garkos Enterprises= Stavros Garkos holds many companies around the world. Even though it was never stated which ones are branches of Garkos Enterprises and which ones are not, below is a list of known Garkos companies: Gorgon World: A nightmarish theme park Stavros Garkos has built in Los Angeles by destroying Cal Casey's childhood neighborhood. Garkos intended to destroy a nearby sports centre where impoverished kids could learn and play soccer, so he could build a parking lot for his park. The park and this story took place in \\"Home Game\\". It was never revealed if Garkos ever opened this park, or what happened to it. Garkos International Holding: First (or only once) mentioned in \\"Hot Dog\\", this holding company holds The Hotel Jasper, where Stavros Garkos tried to frame Rude Marley. It's unknown what else is held by Garkos International Holding. Medusa Arms Hotel: Only seen in \\"Target: Winston\\", this is, according to Amanda, the hotel where the Gorgons go to sleep when they are in Hispanola. It was never said if the hotel belongs to Garkos or not, but the name \\"Medusa\\" and its connections to the Gorgons suggest it does belong to him. Medusa Gold- Mining Company: First seen in \\"Team Spirit\\", Garkos utilized it to extract gold from a piece of land stolen from Native Americans. Garkos Finance Company: In \\"Techno-Team\\", this company assisted Stavros Garkos in taking over Walker Laboratories when its former owner, Mickey Walker, had missed the deadline to pay the mortgage. Medusa Network: Out of the idea of having his own television network that would show sport events around the world, Stavros Garkos opened Medusa Network in \\"When Hurricanes Collide\\". When Garkos tried to use its satellite to destroy a space station where five of the Hurricanes were located, Dino hijacked the satellite to prevent the collision. The satellite was left on the loose in space afterwards, having been derailed off its original orbit. In \\"Ecosphere of Death\\", Stavros Garkos gambled against a casino owner named Jackson Black and claimed Black's ecosphere as a reward. Part of the deal was that every time Garkos won, Black would have a chance to recover what he lost. So, Black made a bet against the Gorgons. The Hurricanes won the game and Garkos had to return the ecosphere. In \\"The Flying Eye\\", Garkos tried to force relatives of Amanda Carey out of their land so he could open a water park developed by Garkos Enterprises.

The Sega ports were exclusively released in Europe, while the SNES version was the only version to have a North American release. All versions of the game were published by U.S. Gold. Development for the Sega versions was handled by Arc Developments, while the SNES version was developed by Probe Entertainment. Despite the show revolving around soccer, all three games are action games in which the player uses soccer balls to defeat enemies, similar to Soccer Kid. Despite the Sega versions being developed by the same company, they differ in gameplay. In the Game Gear version, the goal is to collect a certain amount of items strewn about each stage before heading to the exit, whereas in the Mega Drive version, the goal is to simply make it from the beginning to the end of the stage.

Previously part of Kachhi District, it was established as a district of its own in December 1991 and after a brief period in which it was known as Kachhi (the remainder of the old Kachhi district being renamed to Bolan), its name was changed to Jhal Magsi in May 1992. The district is named after the town of Jhal, seat of the Magsi tribe, the major Baloch tribe within the district. Historically, the Magsi tribe branched off from the earlier Lashari tribe. The district has two main towns, Gandawah, the administrative centre and Jhal Magsi; and is divided into two subdivisions: Gandawah and Jhal Magsi. The district has a hospital that was built by the government of Punjab to help their Balochistani brothers. The predominant religion is Islam (%), although there is a minority (1%) of Hindus. The most common first languages are Balochi (%), Sindhi (%) and Saraiki (%). Administrative divisions Jhal Magsi District is administratively divided into two tehsils, Jhal Magsi and Gandawah; with one sub tehsil (Mirpur). Both subdivisions have a different administrative history. It had nine Union Council in 2012, but last year four Union Council were added by the Local Government Department at recommendation of Deputy Commissioner/Delimitation Officer. Namely, the union councils of Jhal Magsi District are as under: * Gandawah Tehsil # Union Council Gandawah # Union Council Khari # Union Council Patri * Mirpur Sub Tehsil # Union Council Mirpur * Jhal Magsi Tehsil # Union Council Jhal Magsi # Union Council Hathiari # Union Council Panjuk # Union Council Kot Magsi # Union Council Barija # Union Council Mat Sindhur # Union Council Safrani # Union COuncil Saifabad # Union Council Akbarabad  Education  According to the Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017, district Jhal Magsi is ranked at number 108 out of the 141 ranked districts in Pakistan on the education score index. This index considers learning, gender parity and retention in the district.

Post primary access is a major issue in the district with 84% schools being at primary level. Compare this with high schools which constitute only 5% of government schools in the district. This is also reflected in the enrolment figures with 7,553 students enrolled in class 1 to 5 and only 118 students enrolled in class 9 and 10. Gender disparity is another issue in the district. Only 33% schools in the district are girls‚Äô schools. Access to education for girls is a major issue in the district and is also reflected in the low literacy rates for females. Moreover, the schools in the district lack basic facilities. According to Alif Ailaan Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017, the district is ranked at number 142 out of the 155 districts of Pakistan for primary school infrastructure. At the middle school level, it is ranked at number 141 out of the 155 districts. These rankings take into account the basic facilities available in schools including drinking water, working toilet, availability of electricity, existence of a boundary wall and general building condition. More than 200 out of the 301 government schools in the district do not have electricity, toilet and a boundary wall. 139 schools do not have clean drinking water.

Overview of claims of \\"actual innocence\\" In its most literal sense, \\"actual innocence\\"‚Äîmore properly understood as a claim that the prosecution has failed to prove factual guilt beyond a reasonable doubt‚Äîis a very commonly raised defense to a crime.Paul Bergman, Sara J. Berman-Barrett, The Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive the System (2007), p. 285 (stating \\"Undoubtedly, the most common defense argument is that the prosecution has failed to prove the defendant guilty\\").Thomas J. Gardner, Victor Manian, Criminal Law: Principles, Cases, and Readings (1975), p. 123 (stating \\"The most common defense to a criminal charge is that of denying that the defendant committed the offense\\"). Claims of actual innocence may involve disputing that any crime occurred at all, or that the accused was the perpetrator of the criminal act. Arguably, even affirmative defenses such as \\"self-defense\\", insanity, or \\"mistake of fact\\" qualify as \\"actual innocence\\" claims because while in those cases the accused admits to both his or her identity as the actor and to the existence of the act (\\"actus reus\\"), he or she is claiming that the State cannot prove that he or she had the requisite mental state (\\"mens rea\\") to constitute a crime. However, the specific term \\"actual innocence\\" is most often used in the context of someone convicted for a crime he or she did not commit. Claims of \\"actual innocence\\" are, in that sense, usually raised in post-conviction challenges to a conviction. The Tarlton Law Library at the University of Texas at Austin maintains an \\"Actual Innocence awareness database\\" containing \\"resources pertaining to wrongful convictions, selected from the popular media (such as newspaper articles and segments which aired on television news magazines), journal articles, books, reports, legislation and websites\\". In the United States, establishing \\"actual innocence\\" after a conviction may be considerably more difficult than winning an acquittal at trial, however. At trial, the defendant enjoys a due process right to the presumption of innocence, and the State is obligated to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Cochran v. United States, 157 U.S. 286, 299 (1895). However, \\"innocence\\" is a factual question, and once a fact-finder‚Äîjudge or jury‚Äîmakes a factual determination, appellate and post-conviction courts generally are bound by those factual determinations. Appeals and post-conviction cases, by their very nature, focus on legal errors, not factual disputes. Indeed, it is unclear whether proof of actual innocence is, in and of itself, grounds for appellate reversal. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993) A convicted person has two avenues for attacking the validity of his or her conviction and/or sentence. The first is direct appeal. Direct appeals are limited in number and scope, and address only those issues raised in the lower court. The second method of attacking the validity of a conviction is known as \\"collateral\\" review, and can take many forms, including state and federal petitions for writs of habeas corpus, petitions for writs of error coram nobis, and‚Äîincreasingly‚Äîa newly developed form of collateral relief which allows petitioners to raise claims of actual innocence, whether through DNA testing or through some other method. Thus, it is in collateral, post-conviction filings that claims of actual innocence are most likely to be considered. The typical innocence defense Because the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a defendant asserting actual innocence need only raise a reasonable doubt as to whether they were the person who committed a particular crime, or whether the acts that they committed amount to the commission of a crime. In point of fact, the defendant is not obliged to present a defense at all. Examples of an actual innocence defense include: *Alibi ‚Äì the defendant will present evidence of having been in a different location at the time the act occurred, thereby making it impossible for the defendant to have committed the crime. *Mistaken identity ‚Äì although the prosecution bears the burden of proving that a defendant has been properly identified, the defendant may still need to call into question the memory and/or credibility of witnesses claiming to have seen the commission of the crime. Alibi and/or mistaken identity defenses constitute \\"agency\\" defense‚Äîan argument that the accused is not the criminal agent. *Frameup ‚Äì the defendant will assert that falsification of evidence has resulted in the creation of a meritless case against him or her, usually by the police or similar persons of authority with access to the crime scene, or by private parties hoping to profit from the defendant's misfortune. If the prosecution is relying on the defendant's confession, the defendant may assert that a false confession was extracted through coercive means. Many celebrated criminal cases have rested solely on the defense that the defendant did not commit the crime‚Äîfor example, O.J. Simpson, Robert Blake, and Michael Jackson all claimed that they simply had not committed the acts charged. By contrast, defendants such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Susan Smith, and Lorena Bobbitt conceded that they committed the criminal act, but raised defenses such as insanity or diminished capacity. Other defendants, such as George Zimmerman, conceded that the act was committed, but asserted that it was justified, and therefore not a crime.  \\"Actual innocence\\" pleas in post-conviction collateral proceedings  Because most forms of post-conviction collateral relief are limited to procedural or Constitutional flaws in the trial itself, claims of \\"actual innocence\\" generally are recognized only in those states which have adopted specific \\"actual innocence\\" statutes. Otherwise, in order to obtain post- conviction collateral relief, a defendant must often plead a specific statutory grounds for relief, i.e., that the conviction was obtained in violation of the Constitution of the United States. In jurisdictions that restrict a court's power to hear a post-conviction petition to a time period defined by statute, the court cannot grant post-conviction relief upon expiration of the time period regardless of the discovery of proof of \\"actual innocence\\" of the crime for which he was convicted. The jurisdictional bar is often rationalized by citing the requirement of finality of the judicial process in order to maintain the integrity of the system. While some argue that this is unjust for the convicted, it is rationalized that continued specter of \\"actual innocence\\" after the conclusion of a trial would make the adjudication process moot, which may lead to rule of law problems. In the United States, this tradition has been heavily revised. As DNA testing grew more sophisticated, every state adopted statutes or rules allowing newly discovered DNA results to form the basis of a challenge to a conviction on grounds of \\"actual innocence\\". The scope and breadth of an inmate's ability to bring a DNA-based claim of actual innocence varies greatly from state to state. The Supreme Court has ruled that convicted persons do not have a constitutional due process right to bring DNA-based post-conviction \\"actual innocence\\" claims. District Attorney's Office v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52 (2009). Thus, the way such claims are handled may vary greatly from one jurisdiction to the next. Following reports of a sizable number of DNA-based exonerations, some states also have adopted broader \\"actual innocence\\" statutes allowing post-conviction challenges on the basis of newly discovered evidence in general. The Commonwealth of Virginia adopted such a law in 2004, subjecting petitioners to a very high standard of proof to overturn a conviction: that \\"the previously unknown or unavailable evidence is material and, when considered with all of the other evidence in the current record, will prove that no rational trier of fact would have found proof of guilt or delinquency beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" Va. Code Ann. ¬ß 19.2-327.11. Upon the presentation of such evidence, the Virginia Court of Appeals (its intermediate appellate court) may reverse the conviction. In 2009 the State of Maryland adopted a law with a significantly lower standard: the new evidence must \\"create[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different[.]\\" Md. Code Ann., Crim. Pro. Art. ¬ß8-301. However, the Maryland law allows for a retrial rather than a summary reversal. The State of Utah has adopted an actual innocence statute. The legislatures of Wyoming and Missouri were considering similar laws in 2013. Even in those jurisdictions without formal \\"actual innocence\\" provisions in their post-conviction statutes, actual innocence can have a procedural effect, in that it will excuse procedural default and permit the filing of a successor collateral relief petition. This is based on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298 (1995), in which a death row inmate filed a second federal habeas corpus petition, asserting as substantive claims the claims that his trial lawyer had ineffectively failed to present alibi witnesses and that the Government had wrongly concealed exculpatory evidence. Schlup also argued that he was actually innocent‚Äînot because that was a substantive ground for relief, but because his actual innocence excused his failure to raise his ineffective- counsel and prosecutorial-nondisclosure claims in his state court pleadings and in his first federal habeas petition. Whether or not relief was to be granted, the Schlup Court held, depended on the merits of his ineffective counsel and prosecutorial nondisclosure claims. Pleading in the alternative Because pleading in the alternative is generally permitted in criminal cases, a defendant may claim to have not committed the crime itself, but at the same time may claim that if the defendant had committed the crime, the act was excused for a reason such as insanity or intoxication, or was justified due to provocation or self-defense. Such claims are, for obvious reasons, difficult to present to juries, because they entail arguing both that the defendant did and did not commit the crime alleged. An English perspective Much of U.S. criminal law is derived from the English common law, whose standard analysis is that (with the exception of strict liability offenses) a crime is made up of two parts: (i) the guilty act (actus reus) (ii) and the guilty intention (mens rea). A court examines the issues in sequence since there is little point in establishing intent if the accused did not commit the act. The court will convict only if the actus and the mens are shown beyond reasonable doubt. If convicted, the accused may contest either or both of the findings of actus or mens. England does not have the specific concept of \\"actual innocence\\" but the courts are concerned to ensure that an innocent person is not subject to a criminal penalty. The appeal process will not impose an onus of proof of \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\" to show innocence, but (even if the process takes years) a court will allow new evidence to be adduced if it tends to show that the accused did not (or could not) commit the crime. The United Kingdom, like all 47 Member States of the Council of Europe, is a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights,http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm and is prohibited by Article 3 from using the death penalty so there is no longer the fear that an innocent man may be executed. The case of prisoner Troy Davis, executed 21 September 2011, illustrates the difficulties that a person has, once convicted, to prove his \\"actual innocence\\" in the U.S. References Further reading *Jim Dwyer, Peter Neufeld, Barry Scheck, Actual Innocence: When Justice Goes Wrong and how to Make it Right (2001) . * Jon B.

When he was invited to join the plot, he instead reported it to Tsar Nicholas I, though without revealing the names of the officers involved. Rostovtsev went on to hold posts in military education, and was involved in the administration of the cadet corps, reaching the rank of Full General. In 1857, when the Tsar made public his plans under the Nazimov Rescript to reform the institution of serfdom, Rostovtsev was appointed to the Editing Commission charged with developing those plans, after a conservative leaning secret commission found Emancipation to be impossible. His subsequent report was well received, and brought him the chairmanship of the Commission whose task was to draft the necessary statutes. The resulting statutes were issued on 19 February 1861, a year after Rostovtsev's death. On that occasion Rostovtsev's widow and children were made Counts of the Russian Empire.

The population at the 2011 census of the ward was 6,817 and 111,787 for the district. Gedling was once a distinct settlement, having been recorded in the Domesday Book, although nowadays‚Äîdue to the growth of Nottingham‚Äîit is difficult to separate it from the neighbouring town of Carlton. History Gedling was first settled around Saxon times, when the Saxon chief Gedl (hence the name Gedling, coming from the chief \\"Gedl\\" and \\"Ing\\" being Saxon for People, Gedl-Ing meaning \\"Gedl's People\\") sailed up the River Trent, and then up the Little Ouse dyke, until he could get no further upstream. He landed at the spot which is thought to be the present-day site of All Saints' Church. Gedling has had several versions of its name including Ghellinge, Gedlinga, Geddlings, and Gettang. Despite being a fairly small place, Gedling gives its name to the local borough council which has its offices in nearby Arnold, and also to the local parliamentary constituency, which covers the suburbs to the east of Nottingham, including Arnold and Carlton. Village pubs are the Gedling Inn (once the Chesterfield Arms) and The Willowbrook on Main Road. =Church= In the older part of Gedling is All Hallows' Anglican Church. It dates from the 11th century, with the oldest part of the church (the entrance) dating back to 1089 ‚Äì although there have been four other churches on this site, the oldest dating back to the year 678AD. Colliery Gedling Colliery, which was the life-blood of Gedling and many of the surrounding villages, opened in 1899 and was closed in 1991. 128 men died at the colliery, which produced over a million tonnes of coal per year in the 1960s. It developed a reputation as the \\"pit of all nations\\" because of the diversity of foreign miners who worked there: in the 1960s, ten per cent of the colliery's workforce of 1,400 were originally from the Caribbean. The site was opened as Gedling Country Park on 28 March 2015. =Country park= Opened in March 2015 on the site of the former Gedling Colliery, the site has views of Gedling, and from its highest point there are views across Nottinghamshire and into neighbouring Lincolnshire and Leicestershire. On a clear day it is possible to see as far as Belvoir Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. There are a number of paths that weave their way through the woodlands and grasslands that make up the flora and fauna within the country park. Railway station There are plans to either reopen the railway line from Nottingham railway station and to reopen Gedling railway station which was closed on 4 April 1960, or to open the old line as a part of the Mineral Line cycleway. The original station building is now owned by a youth group. The line itself officially closed in 1995 when the line to the colliery eventually was classed as redundant. Education The local school is the Carlton le Willows Academy, Wood Lane, Gedling for 11-to-18 year olds.

It was formed after the Emperor Napoleon III was captured by the Prussian Army. The government, headed by General Louis Jules Trochu, was under Prussian siege in Paris. Breakouts were attempted twice, but met with disaster and rising dissatisfaction of the public. In late January the government, having further enraged the population of Paris by crushing a revolutionary uprising, surrendered to the Prussians. Two weeks later, it was replaced by the new government of Adolphe Thiers, which soon passed a variety of financial laws in an attempt to pay reparations and thus oblige the Prussians to leave France, leading to the outbreak of revolutions in French cities, and the ultimate creation of the Paris Commune.  Origins  When the Franco-Prussian War began in 1870, France was under the rule of Emperor Napoleon III. A National Assembly was based in Paris, but its powers were limited. Widespread discontent amongst Assembly members before the war, particularly amongst socialist members, had given Louis-Napoleon many enemies. At the disastrous battle of Sedan, Napoleon was captured by the Prussian Army, leaving France effectively without a government. When news of Napoleon's capture reached Paris, leading members of the National Assembly rushed to the H√¥tel de Ville to declare a new government. At the H√¥tel de Ville, L√©on Gambetta publicly declared the founding of the Government of National Defence on September 4, and the government immediately assumed control of all affairs in France, intending to continue the war against Prussia.  Notable members  Despite the hopes of revolutionary, radical left-wing politicians in Paris, the Government of National Defence was composed almost entirely of middle- class, conservative men, who were already Deputies in the National Assembly representing Paris constituencies. When offered the post of President, Jules Trochu accepted it based on the Assembly's promise that they would \\"resolutely defend religion, property, and the family\\". *General Louis Jules Trochu, President of the Government *L√©on Gambetta, Minister of the Interior *Jules Favre, Vice-President, Minister of Foreign Affairs *Adolphe Le Fl√¥, Minister of War *L√©on Martin Fourichon, Minister of the Navy and the Colonies *Ernest Picard, Minister of Finance *Jules Ferry, Secretary of the Government *Jules Simon, Minister of Education, Religion, and Arts *Adolphe Cr√©mieux, Minister of Justice *Emmanuel Arago, Minister of the Interior *Pierre Fr√©d√©ric Dorian, Minister of Public Works *Henri Rochefort, Minister without Portfolio *Alexandre Glais-Bizoin, Minister without Portfolio *Louis-Antoine Garnier- Pag√®s, Minister without Portfolio *Eug√®ne Pelletan, Minister without Portfolio The new government was almost entirely middle-class, and citizens of Paris wondered how long the uneasy alliance between the revolutionary left-wing Republicans and the conservative right-wing Republicans would last. The Government of National Defence quickly received official recognition from leading world powers in the following days, except from Prussia. The Prussian Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, was concerned that the new body could not act as France's government, as it was composed entirely of men from Paris, without any consideration being given to the rest of France. This was not a great concern to the Government though, as its members intended to continue the war against Prussia.  Besieged  With most of the army captured at Sedan, the Government of National Defence called almost all military units from across France, including marines, naval units, and troops on foreign service in Rome, Algeria, and French colonies, to aid in the defence of Paris before the Prussians reached the city. The Government greatly increased the already formidable fortifications around Paris and brought in vast quantities of food from the countryside, to feed the swollen population of the city throughout the expected siege. Having sworn in General Trochu as President, the National Assembly left Paris and relocated to Bordeaux. Concerned that the rest of the country might complain about the Parisian-dominated government, Admiral Fourichon and Gaston Cremieux, both elderly men, were dispatched to Tours as a representative delegation on behalf of the government in Paris. By September 20 1870 Paris was completely surrounded and cut off from the rest of unoccupied France. On October 7, L√©on Gambetta left Paris by hot air balloon and arrived in the city of Tours, from which he and his deputy Charles de Freycinet directed the war across unoccupied France. Although they were part of the same national government, the governments in Paris and Tours often acted without consulting each other, due largely to the problem of communication between besieged Paris and the outside world. The National Assembly in Bordeaux had very little say in government affairs, as they had no reliable means of contacting Paris and Gambetta did not have time to wait for the Assembly to debate issues. As a result, Gambetta became the virtual dictator of unoccupied France during the war. Throughout the siege, the Government of National Defence was reluctant to try to break out of Paris, and as the siege wore on, the population of Paris grew more and more frustrated at the Government. The government did in fact try to break out twice, once in late November 1870 and once again in mid-January 1871. The \\"Great Sortie\\", beginning on the night of November 28, was a cataclysmic disaster. Thousands of soldiers were killed and the population of Paris, whose hopes had been raised far beyond rationality, were shattered by the news of the sortie's defeat. Blame was heaped upon the Government of National Defence, and increased through December as the city's food supplies began to run out. The population was angry that the Government was suspicious of the National Guard based in Paris - whilst the civilian population saw the National Guard as an unstoppable force, the Government perceived them as a rabble of ill- disciplined drunks who would run away at the first shot. When the Government decided to placate civilian sentiment by using the National Guard in the next sortie of 18 January 1871, their suspicions were confirmed as the National Guard panicked and fled back into Paris, provoking the civilian population to blame the Government for being incompetent and cowardly.  End of the government  After the failure of the January 18th sortie, it was obvious to the Government that they would never break out of the city. In addition, food stocks were running dangerously low and the city was enduring constant artillery bombardments from the Prussians, and although the shelling was surprisingly ineffective, its demoralising effect on Paris was severe. The Government sacked General Trochu as Governor of Paris on January 22 (although he remained President of the Republic) and replaced him with the elderly General Joseph Vinoy. Jules Favre, though, held real control, and became the de facto leader of the government. A small revolutionary uprising on January 23 was crushed with force by the Government of National Defence, further infuriating the population of Paris. On January 28, 1871, Paris surrendered. Favre, on behalf of the Government of National Defence, and Bismarck signed a Convention on the Armistice and the Capitulation of Paris. Under this Convention Favre agreed to humiliating terms demanded by the Prussians, including the payment of 200 million francs indemnity within a fortnight, over 5 billion francs in total war reparations, and the surrender of the strong fortresses surrounding Paris. In Tours, Gambetta received the news of the surrender by telegram on January 29, and although he still wished to fight on, was convinced to step down by a group of diplomats who arrived from Paris by train on February 6. The negotiations had guaranteed national elections to create a new French government, and on February 8 1871 French citizens (except those in the occupied Prussian territories) voted for a new government. The elections returned an overwhelming number of conservative, middle-class, rural Deputies, who set up a new seat of government at the palace of Versailles. The new National Assembly elected Adolphe Thiers as Chief Executive of the new government and Thiers took over the position of President of France from General Trochu on February 13. Eager to pay reparations and thus oblige the Prussians to leave France, the new government passed a variety of financial laws which deeply angered Parisians, leading to the outbreak of revolutions in French cities, and the ultimate creation of the Paris Commune. 1870 in France 1871 in France Paris Commune 1870 09 1870 09 Cabinets established in 1870 Cabinets disestablished in 1871 ","title":"Government of National Defense"},{"id":"3538873","text":"In classical heraldry, vert () is the tincture equivalent to the colour \\"green\\". It is one of the five dark tinctures (colours). The word vert is simply the French for \\"green\\". It is used in English in the sense of a heraldic tincture since the early 16th century. In Modern French, vert is not used as a heraldic term. Instead, the French heraldic term for green tincture is sinople. This has been the case since c. the 16th century. In medieval French heraldry, vert also meant \\"green\\" while sinople was a shade of red. Vert is portrayed by the conventions of heraldic \\"hatching\\" (in black and white engravings) by lines at a 45-degree angle from upper left to lower right, or indicated by the abbreviation vt. when a coat of arms is tricked. The colour green is commonly found in modern flags and coat of arms, and to a lesser extent also in the classical heraldry of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Green flags were historically carried by the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th to 12th centuries, and by Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 13th century. In the modern period, a Green Ensign was flown by Irish vessels, becoming a symbol of Irish nationalism in the 19th and 20th century. The Empire of Brazil used a yellow rhombus on a green field from 1822, now seen in the flag of Brazil. In the 20th century, a green field was chosen for a number of national flag designs, especially in the Arab and Muslim world because of the symbolism of green in Islam, including the solid green flag of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977). Sometimes, the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues, and represent certain elements and precious stones. Even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries, it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are, since the information may be used for poetic purposes. Many sources give different meanings, but the vert tincture is said to represent the following: * of jewels, the emerald; * of heavenly bodies, Venus. Middle Ages The green tincture was left out of some heraldic works in the Middle Ages, but the first known English treatise, the Anglo-Norman \\"De Heraudie\\" (dated to sometime between 1230 and 1345), lists vert among the other tinctures. The French term sinople was in use prior to the 15th century, but it did not refer to green, but rather to red, being identical in origin to Cinnabar, originally the name of a red pigment also known as sinopia. Descriptions of knightly shields as painted at least partly green in Arthurian romance are found earlier, even in the late 12th century. Le Chevalier de la charrette (c. 1170s) mentions an escu vert d'une part \\"a partly green shield\\" (v. 5785). Clig√®s (c. 1176) mentions a case of armes verts \\"green arms\\" (v. 4669). See Brault (1997:286f.) Here, the Chevalier au Vert Escu (\\"knight with the green shield\\") often marks a kind of supernatural character outside of normal chivalric society (as is still the case with the English \\"Green Knight\\" of c. 1390), perhaps in connection with the Wild Man or Green Man of medieval figurative art. The Anglo-Norman prose Brut (c. 1200) has Brutus of Troy bear a green shield, Brutus Vert-Escu, Brutus Viride Scutum. Green is occasionally found in historical coats of arms (as opposed to the fictional \\"green knights\\" of Arthurian romance) from as early as the 13th century, but it remained rare, and indeed actively avoided, well into the 15th century, but becomes more common in the classical heraldry of the 16th and 17th centuries.\\"There was an antipathy towards green until well into the 15th century\\" Terence Wise, Richard Hook, William Walker Medieval heraldry, vol. 99 of the Men-at-arms series, Osprey Publishing, 1980, , p. 11 An early example of a green escutcheon was that of the coat of arms of Styria, based on the banner of Ottokar II of Bohemia (r. 1253-1278), described by chronist Ottokar aus der Gaal (c. 1315) as: :ein banier gr√ºene als ein gras / darin ein pantel swebte / blanc, als ob ez lebte :\\"a banner green as grass, therein suspended a panther in white, [depicted] as if alive.\\" A curious example occurs in an early armorial of the Burgundian Order of the Knights of the Golden Fleece (Toison d'Or) where the arms of the Lannoy family are recorded as \\"argent, three lions rampant sinople, etc.\\" Despite the fact that sinople signified a shade of red in early heraldry, the lions in this 15th century manuscript are clearly green, although rather faded. The fugitive nature of the green pigments of that day may have had some influence on the low use of that color in early heraldry.

Classical heraldry During the 16th century, green was still rare as a tincture for the field of a coat of arms, but it was used increasingly for the heraldic designs shown in the field, especially when depicting trees or other vegetation. Thus, the coat of arms of Hungary shows a \\"double cross on a hill\\" as a symbol of the √Årp√°d kings, where the cross was shown in silver (argent) and the hill in green, from the late 14th century.the double cross was used from the 12th century, but the \\"hill\\" was added by Louis I of Hungary (r. 1342-1382), later expanded to \\"three hills\\" (\\"on a mount vert a crown Or, issuant therefrom a double cross argent\\"). The only green shown in the arms of the states of the Holy Roman Empire in the Quaternion Eagle by Hans Burgkmair (c. 1510) are the crancelin of Saxony and the Zirbelnuss of Augsburg. The three lions rampant, verts of the Marquessate of Franchimont are attested in the 16th century. Siebmachers Wappenbuch of 1605 shows a number of green heraldic devices in the coat of arms of cities. For example, the coat of arms of the town of Waldkappel (\\"forest chapel\\") as depicting a chapel in a forest on a red field, with the ground on which the chapel is standing, and four trees behind the chapel, drawn in green. There are a number of other examples where Siebmacher as a green \\"mount\\" (the heraldic \\"hill\\" at the bottom of the shield on which the heraldic charge is \\"standing\\"). For the town of Gr√ºnberg, Siebmacher shows a yellow field on which a knight is riding, his horse running on a green \\"hill\\" and the knight flying a green banner.ed. Appuhn (1989), p. 224. Modern flags The Irish Green Ensign, used from the late 17th century.

Green flags flown by revolutionary uprisings include that used in the Vaudois insurrection against Bernese rule in the 1790s (which became the basis of the modern coat of arms of Vaud), the flag of the Irish Saint Patrick's Battalion (1846-1848) and Easter Rising (1916). In the 20th century, a number of national flags were designed involving green, especially in the Muslim world, based on the traditional symbolism of green in Islam, and as one of the Pan-Arab colours. Green is also common among the national flags of African countries; green is one of the Pan-African colours. Other countries have used the colour green in their flags to represent the \\"greenness\\" of their lands and abundance of their nation. The following contemporary national flags feature a solid green field: *the Flag of Brazil (1889, Empire of Brazil from 1822): a yellow rhombus on a green field, in the rhombus a blue disc depicting a starry sky spanned by a curved band inscribed with the national motto, *the flag of Pakistan (1947): a white star and crescent on a dark green field, with a vertical white stripe at the hoist, *the flag of Mauritania (1959): green, with a golden upward-pointed crescent and star, *the flag of Zambia (1964): green, at the fly end stripes in red, black and orange and a depiction of an eagle, *the flag of Bangladesh (1972): a red disc on a green field *the flag of Saudi Arabia (1973): green, with the shahada inscription and a sword in white. *the flag of Dominica (1978): green, a cross in yellow, black and white, and a red disc with a depiction of the sisserou parrot, *the Flag of Turkmenistan (2001): green, with a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, a white waxing crescent moon and five white five-pointed stars appear in the upper corner of the field just to the fly side of the red stripe. Former national flags with green fields further include the solid green flag of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977-2011). References *Brault, Gerard J. (1997).

In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained. A prisere is a collection of seres making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax community. A seral community is the name given to each group of plants within the succession. A primary succession describes those plant communities that occupy a site that has not previously been vegetated. These can also be described as the pioneer community. Computer modeling is sometimes used to evaluate likely succession stages in a seral community. Depending on the substratum and climate, a seral community can be one of the following: ; Hydrosere: Community in water ; Lithosere: Community on rock ; Psammosere: Community on sand ; Xerosere: Community in dry area ; Halosere: Community in saline body (e.g. a marsh)  Examples  Seral communities in secondary succession can be seen in a recently logged coniferous forest. During the first two years, grasses, heaths and herbaceous plants such as fireweed will be abundant. After a few more years shrubs will start to appear; and about six to eight years after clearing, the area is likely to be crowded with young birches. Each of these stages can be referred to as a seral community. In the far western part of North America, chaparral plant communities are typically controlled by periodic natural wildfires. In the southern portion of the Coast Ranges and in Southern California chaparral, toyon is often a locally dominant taxon in seral communities transitional between coastal sage scrub.

Essentially, this is to obtain co-operation between the two parties, in order to ensure as much business as possible can be dealt with in each parliamentary session. Negotiations in the \\"usual channels\\" take place daily, with the key roles being played by civil servants such as the private secretary to the Chief Whip. They determine how the time in each house of Parliament is spent and, prior to the 2010 general election, they decided the composition and the chair of select committees. In 2002, the Hansard Society published a report entitled Opening Up The Usual Channels, which concluded that the Commons would benefit from greater transparency if the system were to be replaced by a formal \\"business committee\\" as used in other legislatures. In 2006, The Constitution Unit at UCL made similar recommendations. In 2009, following the parliamentary expenses scandal, a temporary 'Reform of the House of Commons' select committee, the Wright Committee, was established to consider issues of House of Commons reform. The recommendations in their report included the establishment of a backbench business committee and the election of select committee chairs, which would fundamentally change the way the usual channels work. Following the general election in May 2010, a Backbench Business Committee was established in June, which is responsible for determining the business of the House of Commons for one day each week. Also, for the first time, chairs of select committees were elected by secret ballot by the whole house, while select committee members were elected internally within each party group.

Members of this phylum were categorized in other phyla. The genus Fibrobacter (the only genus of Fibrobacteres) was removed from the genus Bacteroides in 1988.  Phylogeny and Comparative Genomic Studies  Although Fibrobacteres, which consists of a single genus Fibrobacter containing two species, is currently recognized as a distinct phylum, phylogenetic studies based RpoC and Gyrase B protein sequences, indicate that Fibrobacter succinogenes is closely related to the species from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi. The species from these three phyla also branch in the same position based upon conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins. Lastly and most importantly, comparative genomic studies have identified two conserved signature indels (a 5-7 amino acid insert in the RpoC protein and a 13-16 amino acid insertion in serine hydroxymethyltransferase) and one signature protein (PG00081) that are uniquely shared by all of the species from these three phyla. All of these results provide compelling evidence that the species from these three phyla shared a common ancestor exclusive of all other bacteria and it has been proposed that they should all recognized as part of a single ‚ÄúFCB‚Äùsuperphylum.

The only genus in this phylum is Fibrobacter that contains strains from the guts of many mammals including cattle and pigs. The two described species in this genus namely, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Fibrobacter intestinalis are important members of fibrolytic communities in mammalian guts and have received a lot of attention in recent decades due to the long-standing interest microbes capable of degrading plant fiber. Molecular evidence based on the amplification of 16rRNA genes from various environments suggest that the phylum is much more widespread than previously thought. Most of the clones from mammalian environments group along with the known isolates in what has been called Fibrobacteres subphylum 1. Members of Fibrobacteres subphylum 2 however, have so far been found only in the gut of termites. and in some litter-feeding cockroaches. The predominance of Fibrobacteres subphylum 2 in cellulolytic fibre-associated bacterial communities in hindguts of wood-feeding Nasutitermes corniger suggests that they play an important role in the breakdown of plant material in higher termites.

She is also known for her works in Kannada and Malayalam films. Savitri's first significant role was in the 1952 Telugu film Pelli Chesi Choodu. In 1960, she received the Rashtrapati Award for her performance in the Telugu film Chivaraku Migiledi. In 1968, she produced and directed the Telugu film Chinnari Papalu, for which she received the state Nandi Award for Best Feature Film (Silver). She is often referred as \\"Mahanati\\" and \\"Nadigaiyar Thilagam\\". Savitri was starred in enduring classics such as Pathala Bhairavi (1951), Devadasu (1953) which received special mentions at India International Film Festival, Donga Ramudu (1955), Mayabazar (1957), and Nartanasala (1963), featured at Afro Asian film festival in Jakarta.100 Years of Indian Cinema: The 100 land mark Indian films of all timeMovies News Photos-IBNLive She was also starred in works such as Missamma (1955), Ardhangi (1955), Thodi Kodallu (1957), Mangalya Balam (1959), Aradhana (1962), Gundamma Katha (1962), Doctor Chakravarty (1964), Sumangali (1965), and Devata (1965). Savitri received \\"A Moon Among Stars\\" honor at the 30th International Film Festival of India, \\"Woman in Cinema\\" section in 1999. The 2018 biographical film Mahanati based on the life of Savitri has garnered the \\"Equality in Cinema Award\\" at the 2018 Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Early life Savitri was born on 6 December 1936 in a Telugu speaking family in Chirravuru, Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh. Her father was Nissankara Guruvaiya and mother was Nissankara Subhadramma. Her father died when she was six months old, after which her mother took Savitri and an older sibling, Maruti, to live with an aunt and uncle. Her uncle, Kommareddy Venkataramaiah Chowdary, enrolled her in classes when she began to show a talent for dance. Savitri married Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan in 1952, having first met him in 1948. The marriage led to a permanent rift with her uncle because Ganesan was already married, had four daughters and was involved in an affair with Pushpavalli. Her marriage became public when she signed a photograph as Savitri Ganesh. Ganesan later acknowledged that he had two daughters with Pushpavalli while married to Savitri, with whom he had a daughter and a son. Career Savitri on a 2011 stamp of India Savitri acted in dance dramas as a child, including some work with a theatre company run by Kongara Jaggaiah. She made an unsuccessful speculative trip to find film work in Madras at the age of 12, when she was deemed to be too young to play heroine roles, but in 1950 was cast as the female lead in Samsaram. That role did not become actuality because she became too excited, necessitating numerous retakes and eventually her replacement in the part. She was given a minor speaking role in the film and in the next year had two more minor roles, in Roopavati and Patala Bhairavi, before getting her big break as second heroine in Pelli Chesi Choodu. Savriti was known for her hospitality, philanthropic gestures, and her love of buying property and jewellery, but she kept little control of her spending. Ganesan continued to philander and she was susceptible to favouring hangers-on with her largesse. Her career took a downturn in the late 1960s. Her properties were seized by tax officials and she turned to acting in any film that would have her, while sycophants encouraged her to direct and produce films that were unsuccessful and financially draining. Among her few supporters during her financial difficulties was Dasari Narayana Rao, who cast her in most of his films, such as Gorintaku (1979), and specifically made Devadasu Malli Puttadu (1978) as a movie for her. Her only Malayalam film was Chuzhi (1973). Her notable Tamil works include Kalathur Kannamma (1959), Pasamalar (1961), Pava Mannippu (1961), Paarthal Pasi Theerum (1962), Karpagam (1963), Karnan (1963), Kai Koduttha Dheivam, Navarathri (1964), and Thiruvilaiyadal (1965). Death Savitri died on 26 December 1981, at the age of 45, after being in a coma for 19 months. She had developed diabetes and high blood pressure. Legacy In 2011, The Government of India issued a postage stamp in commemoration of Savitri. Savitri's biopic, titled Mahanati, starring Keerthy Suresh as Savitri and Dulquer Salmaan as Gemini Ganesan was released in 2018.

Throws usually involve a rotating motion, the practitioner performing the throw disconnects with the opponent, and ends balanced and on their feet as opposed to a takedown where both finish on the ground. Throws can however also be followed into a top position, in which case the person executing the throw does not disengage from the opponent. Certain throwing techniques called sacrifice throws (sutemi-waza, Êç®Ë∫´ÊäÄ, \\"sacrifice technique\\") involve putting oneself in a potentially disadvantageous position, such as on the ground, in order to execute a throw. Types of throws There are several major types of throw, among Asian martial arts, Judo has the most developed throwing techniques and throws are considered its specialty. Most throws are named by describing the circumvention point of the throw (e.g., hip throw, shoulder throw, wrist throw etc.), or the nature of effect of the throw on the opponent (e.g., heaven and earth throw, valley drop, body drop) with variations are given descriptive names. The names used here are attributed to Jujutsu throws (and hence judo/Aikido throws) are descriptions in Japanese. It is conventional for the Japanese to name their throws in this manner, and many western martial art dojos have given English names to the throws feeling that it is easier for English speaking students to remember the names of throws if they can associate the throws by the descriptive nature of the throw name. In Judo, throws are divided into six categories‚Äîhand techniques, leg techniques, hip techniques, shoulder techniques, as well as sacrifice throws to the rear and side. =Shoulder and back throws= A shoulder throw involves throwing an opponent over the shoulder. A shoulder throw which lifts the opponent from the ground is in Japanese referred to as seoi-nage (ËÉåË≤†„ÅÑÊäï„Åí, \\"Back Throw\\"), while a throw which involves upsetting the opponent‚Äôs balance and pulling the opponent over the shoulder is referred to as seoi-otoshi (ËÉåË≤†ËêΩ„Å®„Åó, \\"Back Drop\\").The Kodokan Judo Institute. Seoi-Otoshi (hand technique). www.kodokan.org. URL last accessed February 11, 2006. Seoi-nage is one of the most used throws in judo competition.

Accessed 2012-11-28. or the similar flying mare in wrestling. =Leg throws, reaps, and trips= In a leg reap, the attacker uses one of their legs to reap one or both of their opponent's legs off the ground. Generally the opponent's weight is placed on the leg that is reaped away. This coupled with the attacker controlling the opponent's body with their hands causes the opponent to fall over. Common leg reaps are judo's Ouchi Gari, Kouchi Gari, Osoto Gari, and Kosoto Gari. There are similar techniques in wrestling, including the inside and outside trips. Somewhat similar to leg reaps involve a hooking or lifting action with the attacking leg instead of a reaping action. The border between the two types of throw can be unclear, and many throws will exhibit characteristics of both reaps and trips, however, the difference is that a reap is one smooth move, like that of a scythe, whereas a hook is pulling the opponents leg up first, and then swinging it away. Common leg trips are hooking variations of Ouchi Gari and Osoto Gari along with Kosoto Gake, referred to as inside and outside trips in Western wrestling. =Hip throws= A hip throw involves using the thrower's hip as a pivot point, by placing the hip in a lower position than an opponent's center of gravity. There are several types of hip throws such as O Goshi, which is often taught first to novices. Hip throws in Judo are called Koshi Waza, and in Aikido or Sumo they are called koshinage. =Sacrifice throws= Sacrifice throws require the thrower to move into a potentially disadvantageous position in order to be executed, such as falling to the ground. The momentum of the falling body adds power to the throw and requires comparatively little strength, compared to the effect. In Judo (as well as in other martial arts), these throws are called sutemi waza and are further divided into rear (ma sutemi waza) and side (yoko sutemi waza) throws. In Judo, these throws are limited to a specific grade and higher due to the element of danger that is placed upon both the uke (receiver) and the tori (thrower). =Pick-ups= Pickups involve lifting the opponent off the ground and then bringing them down again. Common pick-ups are lifting variations of the double leg takedown, Judo's Te Guruma or sukui nage (both classified as hand throws) and the suplex from wrestling, in which the attacker lifts their opponents body vertically and throws the opponent over their own center of gravity while executing a back fall (usually accompanied by a back arch). Variations of the suplex are common in most forms of wrestling and sometimes used in mixed martial arts competition. In Judo, the ura-nage throw is a version of the suplex, but it is classified as a sacrifice throw. = List of throws = Some of the more common throwing techniques are listed below.

His team also developed a vehicle called Junior,Montemerlo, M. et al., which placed second at the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2007. Thrun led the development of the Google self-driving car. Thrun is also known for his work on probabilistic algorithms for robotics with applications including robotic mapping.Robotic mapping: a survey by Sebastian Thrun in In recognition of his contributions, and at the age of 39, he was elected into the National Academy of Engineering and also into the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 2007. The Guardian recognized him as one of 20 \\"fighters for internet freedom\\". Early life and education Thrun was born in 1967 in Solingen, Germany (former West Germany), the son of Winfried and Kristin (Gr√ºner) Thrun. He completed his Vordiplom (intermediate examination) in computer science, economics, and medicine at the University of Hildesheim in 1988. At the University of Bonn, he completed a Diplom (first degree) in 1993 and a Ph.D. (summa cum laude) in 1995 in computer science and statistics. Career and research In 1995 he joined the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a research computer scientist. In 1998 he became an assistant professor and co-director of the Robot Learning Laboratory at CMU. As a faculty member at CMU, he co- founded the Master's Program in Automated Learning and Discovery, which later would become a Ph.D. program in the broad area of machine learning and scientific discovery. In 2001 Thrun spent a sabbatical year at Stanford University. He returned to CMU to an endowed professorship, the Finmeccanica Associate Professor of Computer Science and Robotics. Thrun left CMU in July 2003 to become an associate professor at Stanford University and was appointed as the director of SAIL in January 2004. From 2007‚Äì2011, Thrun was a full professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford. On April 1, 2011, Thrun relinquished his tenure at Stanford to join Google as a Google Fellow. On January 23, 2012, he co-founded an online private educational organization, Udacity. He was a Google VP and Fellow, and worked on development of the Google driverless car system.Thrun, Sebastian \\"What we're driving at\\", The Official Google Blog, October 9, 2010. Retrieved January 17, 2017. Thrun was interviewed in the 2018 documentary on artificial intelligence Do You Trust This Computer?. =Robotics= Thrun developed a number of autonomous robotic systems that earned him international recognition. In 1994, he started the University of Bonn's Rhino project together with his doctoral thesis advisor Armin B. Cremers. In 1997 Thrun and his colleagues Wolfram Burgard and Dieter Fox developed the world's first robotic tour guide in the Deutsches Museum Bonn (1997). In 1998, the follow-up robot \\"Minerva\\" was installed in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, DC, where it guided tens of thousands of visitors during a two- week deployment period. Thrun went on to found the CMU/Pitt Nursebot project, which fielded an interactive humanoid robot in a nursing home near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2002, Thrun helped develop mine mapping robots in a project with his colleagues William L. Whittaker and Scott Thayer, research professors at Carnegie Mellon University. After his move to Stanford University in 2003, he engaged in the development of the robot Stanley, which in 2005 won the DARPA Grand Challenge. His former graduate student Michael Montemerlo, who was co-advised by William L. Whittaker, led the software development for this robot. In 2007, Thrun's robot \\"Junior\\" won second place in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Thrun joined Google as part of a sabbatical, together with several Stanford students. At Google, he co-developed Google Street View. Thrun's best known contributions to robotics are on the theoretical end. He contributed to the area of probabilistic robotics, a field that marries statistics and robotics. He and his research group made substantial contributions in areas of mobile robot localization, mapping (SLAM), and control. Probabilistic techniques have since become mainstream in robotics, and are used in numerous commercial applications. In the fall of 2005, Thrun published a textbook entitled Probabilistic Robotics together with his long- term co-workers Dieter Fox and Wolfram Burgard. Since 2007, a Japanese translation of Probabilistic Robotics has been available on the Japanese market. Thrun is one of the principal investors of the Stanford spin-off VectorMagic.

In humans, argininosuccinate synthase is encoded by the ASS gene located on chromosome 9. ASS is responsible for the third step of the urea cycle and one of the reactions of the citrulline-NO cycle.  Expression  The expressed ASS gene is at least 65 kb in length, including at least 12 introns. In humans, ASS is expressed mostly in the cells of the liver and kidney.  Mechanism  In the first step of the catalyzed reaction, citrulline attacks the Œ±-phosphate of ATP to form citrulline adenylate, a reactive intermediate. The attachment of AMP to the ureido (urea-like) group on citrulline activates the carbonyl center for subsequent nucleophilic attack. This activation facilitates the second step, in which the Œ±-amino group of aspartate attacks the ureido group. Attack by aspartate is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. This step produces free AMP and L-argininosuccinate. Thermodynamically, adenylation of the citrulline ureido group is more favorable than the analogous phosphorylation. Additionally, attack by citrulline at the Œ±-phosphate of ATP produces an equivalent of pyrophosphate, which can be hydrolyzed in a thermodynamically favorable reaction to provide additional energy to drive the adenylation. Reaction catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthetase. Adapted from Goto et al. 2003.  Structure  = Quaternary = Argininosuccinate synthetase is a homotetramer, with each subunit consisting of 412 residues. The interfaces between subunits contain a number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, and the C-terminus of each subunit is involved in oligomerization by interacting with the C-termini and nucleotide-binding domains of the other subunits. = Active site = X-ray crystal structures have been generated for argininosuccinate synthetase from Thermus thermophilus, E. coli, Thermotoga maritime, and Homo sapiens. In ASS from T. thermophilus, E. coli, and H. sapiens, citrulline and aspartate are tightly bound in the active site by interactions with serine and arginine residues; interactions of the substrates with other residues in the active site vary by species. In T. thermophilus, the ureido group of citrulline appears to be repositioned during nucleophilic attack to attain sufficient proximity to the Œ±-phosphate of ATP. In E. coli, it is suggested that binding of ATP causes a conformational shift that brings together the nucleotide-binding domain and the synthetase domain. An argininosuccinate synthetase structure with a bound ATP in the active site has not been attained, although modeling suggests that the distance between ATP and the ureido group of citrulline is smaller in human argininosuccinate synthetase than in the E. coli variety, so it is likely that a much smaller conformational change is necessary for catalysis. The ATP binding domain of argininosuccinate synthetase is similar to that of other N-type ATP pyrophosphatases. Active site of argininosuccinate synthetase shown with bound citrulline, ATP, and aspartate interacting with select active site residues. Modeled using PyMol from PDB 1J1Z.  Function  Argininosuccinate synthetase is involved in the synthesis of creatine, polyamines, arginine, urea, and nitric oxide. = Arginine synthesis = The transformation of citrulline into argininosuccinate is the rate-limiting step in arginine synthesis. The activity of argininosuccinate synthetase in arginine synthesis occurs largely in at the outer mitochondrial membrane of periportal liver cells as part of the urea cycle, with some activity occurring in cortical kidney cells.{ Genetic defects that cause incorrect localization of argininosuccinate synthetase to the outer mitochondrial membrane cause type II citrullinemia. In fetuses and infants, arginine is also produced via argininosuccinate synthetase activity in intestinal cells, presumably to supplement the low level of arginine found in mother's milk. Expression of argininosuccinate synthetase in the intestines ceases after two to three years of life. It is thought that regulation of argininosuccinate synthetase activity in arginine synthesis occurs primarily at the transcriptional level in response to glucocorticoids, cAMP, glucagon, and insulin. It has also been demonstrated in vitro that arginine down-regulates argininosuccinate synthetase expression, while citrulline up-regulates it. = Citrulline-NO cycle = The enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase produces nitric oxide from arginine in endothelial cells. Argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase recycle citrulline, a byproduct of nitric oxide production, into arginine. Since nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule, this role of ASS is important to vascular physiology. In this role, argininosuccinate synthetase activity is regulated largely by inflammatory cellular signal molecules such as cytokines. In endothelial cells, it has been shown that ASS expression is increased by laminar shear stress due to pulsative blood flow. Emerging evidence suggests that ASS may also be subject to regulation by phosphorylation at the Ser-328 residue by protein kinase C-Œ± and by nitrosylation at the Cys-132 residue by nitric oxide synthase.  Role in disease  = Citrullinemia = Citrullinemia is an inherited autosomal recessive disease. At least 50 mutations that cause type I citrullinemia have been identified in the ASS gene. Most of these mutations substitute one amino acid for another in ASS. These mutations likely affect the structure of the enzyme and its ability to bind to citrulline, aspartate, and other molecules. A few mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short enzyme that cannot effectively play its role in the urea cycle. Defects in ASS disrupt the third step of the urea cycle, preventing the liver from processing excess nitrogen into urea. As a result, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle (such as citrulline) build up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is toxic, particularly to the nervous system. An accumulation of ammonia during the first few days of life leads to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and the other signs and symptoms of type I citrullinemia. Treatment for this defect includes a low-protein diet and dietary supplementation with arginine and phenylacetate. Arginine allows the urea cycle to complete itself, creating the substrates needed to originally fix ammonia. This will lower blood pH. Additionally, phenylacetate reacts with backed-up glutamine, resulting on phenylacetoglutamine, which can be excreted renally. = Cancer = A lack of argininosuccinate synthetase expression has been observed in several types of cancer cells, including pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and melanoma. For example, defects in ASS have been seen in 87% of pancreatic cancers. Cancer cells are therefore unable to synthesize enough arginine for cellular processes and so must rely on dietary arginine. Depletion of plasma arginine using arginine deiminase has been shown to lead to regression of tumours in mice.

ITV announced the storyline in 2000, a spokeswoman for The Bill was quoted as saying: \\"The character of DS Beech has had a huge storyline running over a very long time where he is a corrupt copper. When we first discussed this with Billy we made it clear that one day his character would get his comeuppance, and he agreed to that.\\" Background The Don Beech Scandal was one of two major storylines centred on corrupt Detective Sergeant Don Beech. Since the character's debut in 1995, his corruption had steadily grown, taking backhanders from suspects, making deals with dodgy criminals, and getting himself immersed into the underworld of crime. The Scandal played out over three years in the show - beginning with the introduction of DS Claire Stanton in 1999 and Beech's imprisonment in his second major storyline in 2001. The storyline concluded with the whole of CID being suspended, with only four officers being reinstated. Synopsis After it was suspected that he had been involved in corrupt criminal activity, unbeknown to Beech, a new Detective Sergeant, Claire Stanton, was placed at Sun Hill. An undercover officer from the Complaints Investigation Bureau, she infiltrated Sun Hill CID to gather evidence and expose Beech's corrupt activities. Beech revealed his activities to fellow officer, DS John Boulton, and offered him a bribe for his help in escaping his superiors. Boulton refused, and in the resulting fight, Beech headbutted Boulton, breaking his nose, and causing him to collapse. Boulton responded by trying to strangle Beech, but Beech slammed his head against the floor, killing him. Nobody suspected Beech of being the killer, and his eventual downfall took place when he entered into a corrupt business relationship with local crime-boss Howard Fallon, which resulted in Beech destroying evidence implicating Fallon, intimidating witnesses and supplying intelligence on the progress of police investigations into Fallon's empire. When his actions began to come to light, Beech fled. Following Beech's disappearance, CIB under the leadership of Commander Ford (Mark McGann), suspend and interview each member of CID. Duncan Lennox is shocked to discover that Claire Stanton is a CIB mole. Charles Brownlow is informed by Chief Superintendent Guy Mannion (Nick Miles) that he is expected to resign. He refuses at first, but Inspecter Monroe makes him realise that he has no choice. Beech attempts to raise as much money as he can, whilst Jack Meadows (Simon Rouse) contacts Commander Campbell from Scotland Yard. Following the CIB investigation, Ford is satisfied that there was no one else was involved in Beech‚Äôs corruption , but is unimpressed by the breakdown in supervision, accountability and line management in CID and Chief Superintendent Mannion informs Deakin and Daly that they are to be transferred. Meadows survives at the request of Commander Campbell. DC Holmes requests a transfer. Deakin and Daly are appalled to discover that Meadows has used his connections to save himself, and Deakin tells Meadows \\"up yours, Jack!\\". Beech collects a false passport, exchanges a bag of stolen money for some diamonds, and boards a plane to Australia. Cast upheaval Executive Producer Richard Handford was responsible for terminating the contracts of eight actors, including Eric Richard (Sgt. Bob Cryer), Ray Ashcroft (DS Geoff Daly), Joy Brook (DC Kerry Holmes), Peter Ellis (Chief Supt. Charles Brownlow) and Shaun Scott (DI Chris Deakin). Russell Boulter (DS John Boulton) and Billy Murray (DS Don Beech) both left by mutual agreement. Ellis only found out he was leaving when his son, who worked for The Bill as a scriptwriter, informed him. Seven of these characters left as a result of this storyline.

The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is a fund allocated by the European Union. Its purpose is to transfer money from richer regions (not countries), and invest it in the infrastructure and services of underdeveloped regions. This will allow those regions to start attracting private sector investments, and create jobs on their own. History During the 1960s, the European Commission occasionally tried to establish a regional fund, but only Italy ever supported it. Britain made it an issue for its accession in 1973, and pushed for its creation at the 1972 summit in Paris. Britain was going to be a large contributor to the CAP and the EEC budget, and sought to offset this deficit by having the ERDF established. They would then be able to show their public some tangible benefits of EEC membership. The ERDF was set to be running by 1973, but the 1973 oil crisis delayed it, and it was only established in 1975 under considerable British and Italian pressure.George, Stephen (1990). An Awkward Partner: Britain in the European Community. Oxford University Press. pp. 56‚Äì67. . It started with a budget of 1.4 billion units of account, much less than the original British proposal of 2.4 billion units of account, but has increased rapidly both proportionally and absolutely in the course of time. Since its creation, it has operated under changing set of rules that were standardised with Single European Act and is now in its 2014‚Äì2020 period. Scope (2014‚Äì2020) As part of its task to promote regional development, the ERDF contributes towards financing the following measures: ;Objective convergence * Modernising and diversifying economic structures * Creating sustainable jobs * Stimulating economic growth * Attention to urban, remote, mountainous, sparsely populated, and the outermost regions ;Regional competitiveness and employment * Innovation and knowledge economy (e.g., research and technological development, innovation and entrepreneurship, financial engineering) * Environment and risk prevention (e.g., cleaning up polluted areas, energy efficiency, clean urban public transport, risk prevention plans) * Access to transport and telecommunications ;Territorial cooperation * Cross-border economic, social, and environmental activities * Transnational cooperation, including bilateral cooperation between maritime regions * Inter-regional cooperation, including networking and exchange of experiences between regional and local authorities ERDF compliance All awards of ERDF must comply with European Union competition law (including State Aid Law and Government procurement in the European Union). Failure to comply with these legal requirements may result in irregularity rulings which carry financial implications. Criticism One project supported by the Fund is the Golf Club Campo de Golf in the African Spanish exclave Melilla, located right next to the border with Morocco where African refugees regularly attempt to enter the territory of the EU by climbing a triple fence with razor wire. In 2009, Ecologists in Action called the location insulting and asked the EU to investigate why more than ‚Ç¨1.1m was given to the project by the ERDF. The petition was dismissed, because the objectives of the golf course to ‚Äúincrease tourism, create jobs and promote sport and sporting values‚Äù was compatible with the goals of the ERDF.

The sprawl is performed by scooting the legs backwards, so as to land on the upper back of the opponent attempting the takedown. The resultant position is also known as a sprawl or sprawling position. Ideally, the sprawling combatant should create safe hip extension as much as possible and keep his knees off the floor. His options from the sprawl include attempting to gain leverage on the lower back by hooking underneath the elbows, throwing in a headlock, and grabbing his opponent's ankles and trying to get behind his opponent. Keeping the knees off the ground creates more weight pushing down on the opponent. In mixed martial arts, sprawling is an important aspect of the sprawl-and-brawl strategy, while it is also used by numerous other wrestlers and mixed martial arts stylists. The sprawl is also used in some forms of exercise, and commonly confused with the burpee. The sprawl is generally seen as a bad exercise for the lower-back, this is however not true as the sprawl, when performed correctly by athletes that are conditioned and flexible, is just as safe as the burpee. The important thing is to create hip extension rather than arching the back. Proper hip extension is created by squeezing the glutes, this in turn pulls the pelvis back upon which the spine safely follows.

The head of Spring River is a spring south of Verona just south of Highway 60 which crosses it. The stream meanders through Verona northwest and turns west across Lawrence and Jasper counties. It passes through Carthage, before crossing into Cherokee County, Kansas, where it widens considerably. It flows past the east sides of Riverton and Baxter Springs before emptying into the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees in Ottawa County, Oklahoma.  History  The Spring River takes its name from the many seeps and springs that provide its baseflow. Big Spring in Lawrence County is the largest spring in the Spring River basin, discharging 12.3 million gallons of water per day. The spring flows from the base of a high bluff of Burlington Keokuk limestone known as Baptist Hill, and enters the Spring River about 200 feet away.Jerry D. Vineyard and Gerald L. Feder. Springs of Missouri. Missouri Department of Natural Resources and U.S. Geological Survey. 1974 (revised 1982). The river forms the western boundary of the Ozarks in southwest Missouri and southeast Kansas. All of the Ozark area in southeast Kansas is contained within the Spring River basin. The river was important to Native American tribes and later European-American settlers in Lawrence and Jasper County, especially around Carthage, where it was not yet too wide to dam. Scores of grist and sawmills were established on the river in those counties beginning as early as the 1840s. A dam erected northeast of Carthage in 1875 provided water power to mills and other industry through a mile-long millrace, which fed into an industrial basin on north Main street. The concentration of industry there continues to affect the water quality in the river.Redden, Susan. Plan to focus on health of Spring River watershed. The Joplin Globe.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy. Retrieved on 2007-08-11. Such tires are now commonly installed as standard, either mandated by law or to meet eco labelling standards.  Measuring rolling resistance in tires  Rolling resistance can be expressed by the rolling resistance coefficient (RRC or Crr), which is the value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. A lower coefficient means the tires will use less energy to travel a certain distance. The coefficient is mostly considered as independent of speed, but for precise calculations it is tabled at several speeds or an additional speed-dependent part is used. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) are usually performed on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.\\"Tires and Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy: Informing Consumers, Improving Performance -- Special Report 286.\\", National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-08-11 In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with coast-down tests. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds. In 2009 The CEC used a rating called Rolling Resistance Force RRF. RRF and RRC, rolling resistance coefficient are very similar. Difference is taking the RRF and dividing it by the load(weight) to get RRC. So a Michelin Harmony tire rated at 9.45 RRF at 1000 pounds load would be .0095 RRC.California Energy Commission 77 tires RRF In the early 2010s in Canada, Transport Canada tests were planned on a number of different tires mounted on 15 and 16-inch rims ‚Äì the most common tire sizes in Canada at that time ‚Äì to determine how rolling resistance is influenced by vehicle size, tire width and profile. Results will be used to inform Canadians about the types of low rolling resistance tires available in Canada, and whether they can help reduce fuel consumption and pollutants from passenger vehicles.Transport Canada LRR Study SAE J2452 is a standard defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers to define the rolling resistance of tires. The rolling resistance coefficient (RRC) indicates the amount of force required to overcome the hysteresis of the material as the tire rolls. Tire pressure, vehicle weight and velocity all play a role in how much force is lost to rolling resistance. The basic model equation for SAE J2452 is: Rolling Resistance ( N / Lbs) = P^Œ± x Z^Œ≤ x (a + bxV + cxVxV) where: P is the tire inflation pressure ( kPa / psi) Z is the applied load for vehicle weight ( N /Lbs) V is the vehicle speed ( km/h / mph) alpha, beta, a, b, c are the coefficients for the model. The units of the coefficients are matched to the units used in the model, i.e. ( metric / Imperial) This model is newer than SAE J1269 and provides more accuracy over a range of different vehicle loads (weight), tire pressures and vehicle speeds. Fuel consumption A 2003 California Energy Commission (CEC) preliminary study estimated that adoption of low-rolling resistance tires could save 1.5‚Äì4.5% of all gasoline consumption, but that current data were also insufficient to compare safety and other characteristics.California State Fuel-Efficient Tire Report: Volume I California Energy Commission, July 2003. Retrieved on 2007-08-11. A United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) study in 2009 found that if 2% of the replacement tires would reduce their rolling resistance by 5%, there would be 7.9 million gallons fuel and 76,000 metric tons of CO2 saved annually. (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) performed on new tires.  Standard equipment  Because fuel efficiency is an important selling point for most hybrid vehicles, they are often equipped with low- rolling resistance tires. Electric vehicles are also often equipped with low- rolling resistance tires to maximize their range. Auto manufacturers in the United States typically equip new vehicles with tires that have lower rolling resistance than their average after-market replacements, in order to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.Low Rolling Resistance Tires...Which is Best? - TDIClub Forums These include Conti Contact, Michelin Energy, Bridgestone Ecopia, and Goodyear Eagle LS tires.

In the 2010 off-season, a group of local fans bought the team, which had been on the verge of collapse, and established a non-profit fan-owned corporation named GO Heaves, Inc. to operate the team. However, on January 26, 2011 (in the midst of the season), GO Heaves announced the team was ceasing operations. Their players were subject to a dispersal draft.

He ran Ford's Argentina operations at the age of 36. Fields was assigned to Japan to run marketing and sales for Mazda Motor Corporation (then owned by Ford). He was named president and CEO of Mazda Motor Corporation in 2000, at age 38, then the youngest CEO ever of a major Japanese company. Prior to his arrival, Mazda posted an annual operating loss of over $100 million (USD). Fields instituted a turnaround plan that saw Mazda post a 2001 operating profit of $215 million by creating a culture of promoting for talent rather than seniority, reducing labor costs, and implementing a unified design product vision that led to the company‚Äôs \\"Zoom-Zoom\\" brand image of the 2000s. In 2002, Fields became Chairman and CEO of the Premier Automotive Group, Ford's luxury unit, which at the time included Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo Cars. He then was named executive vice president, Ford of Europe and Premier Automotive Group, where he led all activities for Ford's premium vehicle business group and for Ford brand vehicles manufactured and sold in European countries. Ford‚Äôs European operations returned a profit in 2004 for the first time since 1997. All Premiere units other than Jaguar were profitable by 2005. Aston Martin \\"created a new generation of products including the Vantage and DB9\\" that \\"led to the highest sales years in the company's history.\\" In 2005, he returned to the United States to head the Americas division of the company. In this role, he developed the \\"Way Forward\\" plan, which was designed to make Ford's North American operations leaner and more centrally driven in areas such as product development, purchasing and engineering.

In 2015, Ford reported its highest profits and margins ever and was able to distribute $9,300 profit- sharing checks to hourly employees. In 2016, Ford announced plans to redesign its Dearborn headquarters into a walkable, \\"Silicon Valley\\"-style campus. As CEO, Fields committed $4.5 billion to electrified vehicles, including the electric Mustang Mach-E, and returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans race to win on the 50th anniversary of its 1966 victory.

The Constitutional Declaration issued by the National Transitional Council on August 2011 defines the flag of Libya, but does not make any provisions for a coat of arms. A new biometric Libyan passport was revealed in February 2013. The cover of the new passport depicts a star and crescent as its central feature, as found in the flag of Libya. Thus, the symbol can be considered the de facto emblem of Libya's Government of National Accord for all intents and purposes. The Tobruk-based Government was formed in Tobruk under actual guidance of the Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and uses an emblem depicting the Hawk of Quraish and a shield.

In 1972, Libya's participation in the Federation of Arab Republics led both it and Egypt to abandon the Eagle of Saladin, and to adopt as their coats of arms the Hawk of Quraish, the emblem of the tribe of Muhammad used by Syria, which became the coat of arms of the Federation. On Libya's exit from the Federation in 1977 (to become the \\"Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\\"), the Hawk of the Quraish was retained, but modified to reflect the new all green flag that Libya also adopted at that time.

History Pescanova was founded in 1960 by Jos√© Fern√°ndez L√≥pez, who established the company in Vigo. From its beginnings Pescanova introduced cutting-edge technology for the complete activity of fish processing, best defined by the factory ship which was not common in Spain at the time. The business model worked and allowed a continued growth making it one of the biggest firms in the fishing industry. In 1980 Manuel Fern√°ndez de Sousa-Faro, the son of the founder, took over the presidency and, after a period of restructuring, Pescanova became a multinational empire. In 1985 it joined Madrid Stock Exchange. With more than 120 fishing boats and 150,000 tons of fish products sold into the global market every year, Pescanova is among the top 5 companies in its sector. Besides the Spanish facilities, the company has production plants in 21 countries, amongst which are Portugal, Nicaragua, Namibia and Honduras. It had in 2013 approximately 3,400 employees. On 15 April 2013, Pescanova filed in Spanish court for bankruptcy protection. The insolvency filing mentions debts of 1.5bn euros, but financial sources who have had dealings with the company say total debt is probably more than double that amount, potentially making it the country's third-largest bankruptcy. The court accepted the filing and said it would name independent administrators to replace the board.

The initial development of the device started in 1997 in conjunction with the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority & started commercial domestic and international sales in 2002. It is currently in use in sixteen countries. It uses infrared light cones sent from a transmitter to a receiver situated on opposite sides of the road perpendicular to the flow of traffic. It has the ability to classify, record speed, and record volume for motor vehicles. The unit's data logging capabilities are enhanced by several flexible options for output. These options allow for real time applications, such as variable message sign triggering and traffic enforcement, as well as data logging for statistical purposes.  Overview  TIRTL (The Infra-Red Traffic Logger) is manufactured by CEOS Pty Ltd, and marketed by CEOS Industrial. The device was initially developed in 1997 in conjunction with the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority, before the company received a grant from the Government of Australia in 1998 to develop it further before commercial sales started in 2002. It is currently in use in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, South Africa, Turkey, India, Singapore, the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The device is currently in its third generation. It has the ability to record volume, speed, and classification on a bi-directional, multi-lane roadway. Primary applications for this device include speed verification for enforcement purposes, traffic volume and density data collection for both statistical and real time usage, and vehicle classification by axle spacing. The device is usable in both portable and fixed applications, due to its communication capabilities and rugged enclosure. The unit was originally developed to provide secondary verification for intersection safety cameras deployed in the State of Victoria, Australia. It was first deployed in Australia in July 1998. The unit was introduced to the North American market during the 2004 North American Travel Monitoring Exhibition and Conference (NAMTEC), and was first deployed in May 2006.  Operations  = Detection Method = This system consists of a receiver unit and transmitter unit placed on opposite sides of the road perpendicular to the direction of travel. The transmitter sends two cones of infrared light across the roadway, and the receiver records vehicles as they break and remake these cones. TIRTL transmitter's infrared cones cross each other and form two straight and two diagonal beam pathways. When a vehicle crosses the beam pathways, TIRTL records two beam events; it records one from the vehicle breaking and one leaving the beam pathway. These two beams events are recorded for all four beam pathways. Thus, eight timestamped events are generated per axle. The velocity is derived from the timestamps of these beam events. Since the velocity of each vehicle wheel is known and a timestamp is recorded for each axle crossing each beam, the interwheel (or interaxle) spacings can be determined. Once the interaxle spacings are known, it is compared to a table of interaxle spacing ranges stored in the unit to determine the correct classification of the vehicle. The results are stored on a per vehicle basis. =Classification= The unit has a single-board computer running Linux. The computer interprets the supplied traffic classification table (Federal Highway Administration Scheme F, or user supplied) and composes the axle events caused by the parallel beam breaks into a classified vehicle. The classification data is stored in the unit and can optionally can be streamed in real-time via a serial or an Ethernet connection. The raw beam event information can also be saved to the unit for verification purposes. The data is output as plain text. Thus, it can be translated to many common file formats used in traffic data collection. =Features= The devices has two RS232 ports for data transfer. There are optional inbuilt GSM, PSTN, and satellite phone modems available. The unit has the ability to stream traffic information real-time which can drive intelligent traffic signs and send data back to traffic operation centers. There are also adapters available for connection to traffic cameras for enforcement purposes. Studies and approvals *The Australian National Measurement Institute tested the accuracy of the vehicle velocity measurement. They found that there was a 1% deviation at . *TIRTL was reviewed by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. In conjunction with 16 participating state departments of transportation, they conducted a pooled fund study called Portable Non-Intrusive Traffic Detection System (PNITDS). The final report stated that TIRTL correctly classified 94% and 97% of the total vehicles polled. *TIRTL is under review by the Hawaii Department of Transportation for use as the chief sensor in their traffic monitoring system. The system is in competition with other non-intrusive traffic collection devices. *In November 2008, the state of New South Wales, Australia, approved the device for use as a sensor for speed measurement.

Although gay sex was partially decriminalised by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory age of consent for gay sex which was 18 at the time. Offences Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the age of consent for gay sex was different from that of the heterosexual age of consent of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Equivalent heterosexual behaviour was not a crime. The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends. Sentences During sentencing on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given probation and community service orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year suspended prison sentence and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay ¬£500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the age of consent offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of ¬£500,000. Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a result of a high-profile campaign led by gay human rights group OutRage!. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and human rights groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, Amnesty International, pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned. Aftermath In 2000, six of the men appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8 of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation. Legislation subsequently introduced by the Labour Government has broadly equalised the treatment of homosexual and heterosexual behaviours in criminal law. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 equalised the age of consent for gay sex with that of the heterosexual age of consent which is now 16 for both. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and buggery have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a crime in the United Kingdom.

The band played a crucial pioneering role in bringing Caribbean music to the world. Byron Lee died on 4 November 2008, after suffering from cancer for a sustained period. History The band was originally formed around 1950 by Byron Lee and his friend Carl Brady, taking its name from the St. George's College football team for which they played.Thompson, Dave (2002) \\"Reggae & Caribbean Music\\", Backbeat Books, \\"Byron Lee gets OJ in hospital \\", Jamaica Gleaner, 27 October 2008 The band originally played mento, and performed their first shows in the college common room to celebrate the team's victories. After a few years of playing at parties, birthdays and weddings, Lee decided to turn professional. By 1956, the Dragonaires had become a fixture on Jamaica's hotel circuit, playing under their own name and also providing backing to visiting American stars including Harry Belafonte, Chuck Berry, The Drifters, Sam Cooke, and Fats Domino. The Dragonaires prided themselves on being able to play any style of music, their repertoire including covers of American pop and R&B; hits, and they soon adapted to include ska when that became popular. The band recorded their debut single, \\"Dumplin's\\", in 1959 at the WIRL (West Indies Records Limited) studios owned by future Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who became the band's manager. The single was released on the Dragonaire's own Dragon's Breath label in Jamaica, and was the second release on the Blue Beat label in the United Kingdom, and was unusual for a Jamaican single as it featured an electric organ and a Fender bass which Lee had purchased during a visit to the United States - the first such instruments ever seen on the island. Lee and Seaga both realised that ska was the music to provide Jamaica with a musical identity that could break the domination of American R&B;, and the Dragonaires became one of the major ska bands of the early 1960s, releasing singles such as \\"Fireflies\\", \\"Mash! Mr Lee\\", \\"Joy Ride\\", and a ska version of \\"Over the Rainbow\\", both under their own name, and as The Ska Kings. In 1961, the band received a huge break when they were cast as the hotel band in the first James Bond film, Dr. No. The band performed several songs in the film, although the recordings were actually made by guitarist Ernest Ranglin. In 1964, the band was featured in a program called ‚ÄúThis is Ska!‚Äù alongside Jimmy Cliff, Prince Buster, and Toots and the Maytals.Jw31209. \\"This Is Ska! (2/4) 1964 Jimmy Cliff/Prince Buster/Toots & The Maytals and More...\\" YouTube. YouTube, 05 Feb. 2010. Web. 02 Dec. 2016. The band received another major boost when they were selected by Seaga, then the island's head of Social Welfare and Economic Development, in 1964 to travel to the New York World's Fair and perform as a backing band for a showcase of Jamaican talent, including Jimmy Cliff, Prince Buster, and Millie Small. The trip was not a great success, with the Dragonaires' \\"uptown\\" musicians not fitting in with the other \\"downtown\\" artists. Realising that their appeal to ska crowds was diminishing, Lee took the band in a new direction, incorporating calypso and touring Trinidad & Tobago in 1963 and 1964. Also the band contributed the instrumental part of Mighty Sparrow's recording of Only A Fool in 1966. Lee's relationship with Atlantic Records (he acted as head of distribution for the US company in Jamaica) led to the label releasing Dragonaires records in the US, including two albums timed to capitalise on interest generated from the World's Fair performances, Jump Up and Jamaican Ska (on which the Dragonaires backed the likes of The Blues Busters, The Charmers, The Maytals, Stranger Cole, Ken Boothe, and Patsy Todd). The band also targeted the international rocksteady market with albums of mainly cover versions such as Rock Steady Beat and Rock Steady '67. Further, Atlantic Records tried to push the album Jamaican Ska by using house producer and sound engineer Tom Dowd, who produced all of Aretha Franklin's greatest singles, to produce the album. In addition, the Dragonaires were renamed as \\"The Ska Kings\\" on the album. Unfortunately, despite Atlantic's best efforts, Jamaican Ska failed to take off in the United States, although the record \\"Jamaica Ska\\" became a Top 30 single in Canada. Lee bought the WIRL studios from Seaga and turned into Dynamic Sounds Recording Co., where the Dragonaires naturally recorded, using the superior facilities to record a string of well-produced albums during the late 1960s and early 1970s, often containing cover versions aimed at tourists, and they went on to record a series of \\"Reggay\\"-titled albums in the early 1970s. The WIRL name had remained with its division in Barbados and had remained the ever-popular brand of Bajan music until 1995, when it changed its name to E.A. Best Music Ltd, and eventually to its current name, Caribbean Records - still the major record company and distributor of Barbados. Back in Jamaica, Dynamic had become a bigger force than ever before, investing in presenting more of Jamaica's talent to vinyl, including Toots & the Maytals, Eric Donaldson, John Holt, Barry Biggs, Freddie McKay, Tommy McCook, and Max Romeo, issued on imprints such as Jaguar, Panther, Afrik, and Dragon. In 1974, the band played at Trinidad & Tobago's carnival for the first of many times, and the same year they released the Carnival in Trinidad album. They would release both reggae and carnival-oriented albums throughout the 1970s, and in 1975 took in another genre with the Disco Reggae album, released on Mercury Records in the US. The band played at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in both 1978 and 1979, and were one of the main backing bands in 1982. They would also appear in 1984 and 1990. From 1979, the Dragonaires output was heavily concentrated on calypso, soca, and mas, regularly performing at Trinidad & Tobago's carnival, and also touring the Caribbean and North America. Throughout the 1990s they were also regulars at Jamaica's carnival, and their \\"Dance Hall Soca\\" hit (recorded with Admiral Bailey) was credited with starting the ragga-soca craze of the late 1990s. The band continue to tour, recently performing with Kevin Lyttle at the Cricket World Cup 2007 opening ceremony.Soni, Paresh (2007) \\"Night to remember\\", BBC, 12 March 2007 Byron Lee died on 4 November 2008, aged 73, from cancer.\\"Jamaica bandleader Byron Lee, 73, dies from cancer\\", International Herald Tribune The band has continued since Lee's death, with the name initially slightly altered to Byron Lee's Dragonaires.Ogilvie, Anthony (2009) \\"Byron Lee's Dragonaires hasn't missed a beat \\", Jamaica Gleaner, 29 April 2009 They later changed the band name to The Dragonaires as they were no longer able to use Lee's name.Grizzle, Shereita (2015) \\"Dragonaires Retain Their Sound\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 28 June 2015. retrieved 28 June 2015 In August 2014 it was announced that Carl Brady would receive the Order of Distinction in October that year.Campbell, Howard (2014) \\"Marcia Griffiths to receive Order of Distinction\\", Jamaica Observer, 7 August 2014.

It is the smallest of three excavated pre-Columbian temples at Lamanai (the two other temples are the Jaguar Temple and High Temple). Construction most likely began c. 200 BC, and the temple was modified until c. 1300 AD. A mask carving is exposed on the right side wall. Like the rest of the temple, the mask is made from limestone. The mask has Olmec facial features, particularly its upturned lip and broad nose, and is thirteen feet tall. Another carving had been covered by a stone wall on the left side; it was uncovered in the spring of 2011, revealing an identical mask. This reflects the tradition of symmetry in Mayan architecture. The masks were a much later addition, dating c. 400 AD, about 600 years after the temple's original construction. The masks are adorned with the headdress of a crocodile, falling in line with Lamanai's namesake which, translated, means \\"Submerged Crocodile.\\" Because the original masks are made from limestone, they are at risk of erosion from prolonged exposure to weathering. The limestone also wears down from overexposure to the chemicals in sunscreen and the oils from hands. To protect the masks, fiberglass replicas were placed over them. Inside the Mask Temple is a tomb that holds the remains of a man with jade and shell jewelry. Additionally, the tomb once held textiles and mats. Nearby the temple is a second, smaller tomb holding the remains of a woman. Both tombs date from around the same time and likely hold two of Lamanai's former rulers. Their relation is only speculative.

It has been announced officially by the government that the airport will close completely and become retired where it will no longer open again. Overview The future of the airport was in doubt with the opening of Borg El Arab Airport, however in early 2011 the Egyptian Ministry of Civil Aviation announced major plans to overhaul the airport and its facilities to ensure its future as one of the two commercial airports for Alexandria and Nile Delta region. The renovation project is expected to cost US$120 million which will include lengthening the main runway (04/22) by an additional 750m and the construction of a new passenger terminal to replace the existing aging facility. Due to the length of the old runways, the largest aircraft operating into the airport were the Airbus A320-200, Boeing 737-800 and McDonnell Douglas MD-90. The airport has been closed down by December 2011 for two years to implement the expansion project and development and was scheduled to be reopened end of 2014.

Educated in the French style, he served in the Arm√©e de l'air and Troupes coloniales before accepting a role in the army of the new State of Vietnam within the French Union. Hinh is somewhat of an oddity in the 20th century military history of Vietnam as he attained the rank of lieutenant general in two separate countries, not unlike his North Vietnamese counterpart Nguy·ªÖn S∆°n who served as a major general in both the People's Army of Vietnam and the People's Liberation Army of China. Biography Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh was born on 20 September 1915 in V≈©ng T√†u, B√† R·ªãa-V≈©ng T√†u Province as the son of Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T√¢m, a schoolteacher and aspiring functionary in French Cochinchina. Their family name was originally Tr∆∞∆°ng before becoming Nguy·ªÖn. After his primary education and at his father's insistence, Hinh moved to France in 1932 to advance his studies, attending the prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. =Early career= In 1936, he enlisted in the French Air Force and was sent to the √âcole de l'Air in Salon- de-Provence for training. Hinh graduated as pilot and flight engineer in 1937 and was assigned to a bomber squadron in Toulouse, achieving the rank of second lieutenant. With the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of France in 1940, he participated in operations against invading Germans in the northeastern part of the country and Italians in the Alps. Though the French government eventually capitulated, Hinh was awarded the Cross of War for his contribution to the war effort. Following the establishment of a collaborationist regime under Philippe P√©tain in Vichy, Hinh was transferred to West Africa, serving in French Sudan and Senegal. Upon the conclusion of Operation Torch in November 1942, he joined Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces as a first lieutenant. Hinh worked as an air force instructor in Marrakesh until April 1944, when he was reassigned to the European theater in charge of a bomber squadron. At the end of the war, he was admitted to the Legion of Honour and awarded the American Air Medal for his service. For a year after the war, Hinh remained in occupied Germany. Promoted to the rank of commandant in 1948, he was sent to lead a transport wing in Algeria, where he would meet his future wife; the daughter of a local Pied-noir. =Vietnamese National Army= Hinh (left) and Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H·ªØu on parade in Saigon, 1951 Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh was appointed the Vietnamese National Army Chief of Staff by Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i.Saigon: A History Nghia M.

For his service in Vietnam, he was admitted to the National Order of Vietnam and awarded the Vietnam Gallantry Cross. As a senior colonel, Hinh was appointed to the flight test center in Br√©tigny-sur- Orge in 1956, followed by an assignment to the missile test center in Biscarrosse. In 1960, he received command of the airbase at Colomb-B√©char in support of the Algerian War effort. Having avoided involvement in the 1961 Generals' putsch, Hinh was promoted to the rank of brigadier general the following year and appointed deputy chief of defence. In 1965, he was promoted to divisional general and assigned to the Central Directorate of Mat√©riel of the Air Force, overseeing the introduction of new nuclear strike capabilities. As is customary for French military personnel reaching the age of 55, Hinh was scrapped from the flight roster in 1970 and entered the reserves upon his retirement in 1975. After the 1975 Spring Offensive and the fall of South Vietnam, he devoted the following years to helping his former VNA subordinates escape the country and find refuge in France.

Gondwanatitan was found in Brazil, at the time part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, in the late Cretaceous Period (70 mya). Like some other sauropods, Gondwanatitan was tall and ate tough shoots and leaves off of the tops of trees. G. faustoi's closest relative was Aeolosaurus. The type species is Gondwanatitan faustoi, formally described by Kellner and de Azevedo in 1999. Etymology Gondwanatitan means \\"Gondwana Titan\\", and is named after Gondwana, the supercontinent that the genus' South American range was once part of, and the Titans of classical Greek mythology. The type and only named species, G. faustoi, is a patronym honoring Dr. Fausto L. de Souza Cunha, a former curator at the Museu Nacional/UFRJ who led the excavation of the type specimen. Description Gondwanatitan was a fairly small sauropod, only 7 meters long. It had relatively gracile limb bones. The middle caudal vertebrae are distinctively \\"heart-shaped\\", which allows isolated caudal vertebrae to be easily distinguished from those of Aeolosaurus. The vertebrae from the middle part of its tail had elongated centra. Gondwanatitan had vertebral lateral fossae that resembled shallow depressions. Fossae that similarly resemble shallow depressions are known from Saltasaurus, Alamosaurus, Malawisaurus, and Aeolosaurus. Its middle tail vertebrae's neural spines are angled anteriorly when the vertebrae are aligned. These vertebrae resemble those of Cedarosaurus, Venenosaurus, and Aeolosaurus. Classification Gondwanatitan is a member of the clade Aeolosauridae. It is closely related to the genera Pitekunsaurus, Aeolosaurus, and Overosaurus. Provenance The type specimen of Gondwanatitan faustoi was found in strata of the Adamantina Formation. Other material assigned to the genus has been found in the Cambabe Formation. History The type specimen of Gondwanatitan faustoi was discovered in 1983 on the farm of Yoshitoshi Myzobuchi in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The specimen was excavated between 1984 and 1986, but preparation work on the specimen did not begin in earnest until 1997. It was finally described as a new genus and species in 1999. In 2001, G. faustoi was briefly transferred to the genus Aeolosaurus, making Gondwanatitan a junior synonym of that genus, but it has since been widely regarded as separate.

He later established a mosque, Masjid Jami' Tan Hok Liang, in Pondok Rajeg, Cibinong, Bogor. Prior his conversion to Islam, he grew up amid the dark politics of Indonesia. It was during Suharto's New Order rule when gangsters were used in politics, business and government agencies. In 1998, Anton Medan was used as a scapegoat for the orchestration of the Jakarta Riots after which the allegation was then quietly dropped. The riot, which was initially a student demonstration to protest against the Indonesian president Suharto, turned into an anti-Chinese demonstration in the capital Jakarta. Anton Medan is of Chinese descent, but he took to the street and joined the riot to prove that he was loyal to the people but he himself became a target. In the political turmoil of 1998, it was also reported that Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law and the commander of Kopassus, the Indonesian Special Forces, had recruited and manipulated Anton Medan to gain militant supporters. During the investigation of the 1998 riot, Anton Medan denied the accusation that he was actively involved behind the scenes, although he admitted that he was in the middle of the mob.

It was possibly a basal theropodLanger MC, McPhee BW, Marsola JCdA, Roberto-da-Silva L, Cabreira SF (2019) Anatomy of the dinosaur Pampadromaeus barberenai (Saurischia‚ÄîSauropodomorpha) from the Late Triassic Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil. PLoS ONE 14(2): e0212543. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212543 or sauropodomorph. In 2016 Gregory S. Paul estimated it at 2 meters (6.6 ft) and 10 kg (22 lbs), whereas in 2020 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi listed it at 3 meters (10 ft) and 35 kg (77 lbs).  Discovery  Skeletal diagram showing the known remains of all three of the known specimens of Guaibasaurus candelariensis Guaibasaurus was originally named on the basis of the holotype, MCN PV2355, a well-preserved partial postcranial skeleton and the paratype, MCN PV2356, an articulated and nearly complete left hindlimb, which were discovered in the \\"Sesmaria do Pinhal 2\\" locality near Candel√°ria, Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in the upper portion of the Candel√°ria Sequence or the Caturrita Formation. Later, two additional specimens were referred to G. candelariensis: UFRGS PV0725T (an articulated and nearly complete postcranial skeleton missing one forelimb, both feet and the neck), and MCN PV 10112 (a not-fully-prepared block containing articulated parts and some isolated elements, including a partial hand). The referred materials were collected from the \\"Linha S√£o Luiz\\" locality near the town of Faxinal do Soturno, Rio Grande do Sul, also in the upper portion of the Candel√°ria Sequence or the Caturrita Formation. All specimen were collected in these two localities from the lower portion of the Caturrita Formation (Ros√°rio do Sul Group, Paran√° Basin) or alternatively the uppermost Santa Maria 2 Sequence, dating to the early Norian faunal stage of the Late Triassic. A U-Pb (Uranium decay) dating found that the Caturrita Formation dated around 225.42 million years ago, putting it less than 10 million years younger than the Santa Maria and Ischigualasto Formations, from where the earliest dinosaurs are known. Specimen UFRGS PV0725T is articulated with hindlimbs tucked underneath its body and forelimbs flexed to the side. Although most of the neck is not preserved, the vertebrae at the base of the neck are present in UFRGS PV0725T and curve to the left, suggesting the entire neck was curved toward the left side of the body. The posture of this skeleton is similar to the resting position of birds, and is otherwise primarily known from advanced maniraptoran dinosaurs that are closely related to birds. It has also been observed in the dinosauriform Saltopus. Like living birds, Guaibasaurus may have rested in this position to conserve body heat. Guaibasaurus was first named by Jos√© F. Bonaparte, Jorge Ferigolo and Ana Maria Ribeiro in 1999 and the type species is Guaibasaurus candelariensis. The generic name is named after the Rio Gua√≠ba hydrographic basin where the holotype was found as a part of the \\"Prœå-Gua√≠ba Project\\", a scientific program supporting research on fossils from the Triassic period. The specific name is named after Candel√°ria, a city near the fossil locality in which the holotype was found.  Classification  Restoration Jos√© Bonaparte and colleagues, in their 1999 description of the genus, found it to be possible basal theropod and placed it in its own family, Guaibasauridae. Bonaparte and colleagues (2007) found another early Brazilian dinosaur Saturnalia to be very similar to it, and placed the two in the Guaibasauridae which was found to be a primitive saurischian group. Bonaparte found that these forms may have been \\"prosauropods\\" (primitive sauropodomorphs), or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods. Overall, Bonaparte considered that both Saturnalia and Guaibasaurus were more theropod-like than \\"prosauropod\\"-like. More recent cladistic analyses have disagreed on the placement of Guaibasaurus. Some analyses have found it to be a basal theropod,Bittencourt Rodrigues, 2010. Revisao filogenetica dos dinossauriformes basais: Implicacoes para a origem dod dinossauros. Unpublished Doctoral Thesis. Universidade de Sao Paulo. 288 pp. while others consider it a basal sauropodomorph. Other members of \\"Guaibasauridae\\" (such as Saturnalia) are generally considered to be very basal sauropodomorphs, and may or may not form a clade with Guaibasaurus. An article depicting a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for silesaurids also recovers Guaibasaurus as a sauropodomorph, but close-related to the coeval Unaysaurus and Macrocollum, rather than early forms such as Saturnalia. Thus, Unaysauridae is a junior synonym of Guaibasauridae in this proposal.

Some patients may also have an elevation of ammonia, a toxic chemical, which can affect the nervous system. Argininosuccinic aciduria may become evident in the first few days of life because of high blood ammonia, or later in life presenting with \\"sparse\\" or \\"brittle\\" hair, developmental delay, and tremors. An infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may seem lethargic or be unwilling to eat, have poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature, experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay and mental retardation. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen. Immediate treatment and lifelong management (following a strict diet and using appropriate supplements) may prevent many of these complications. Occasionally, an individual may inherit a mild form of the disorder in which ammonia accumulates in the bloodstream only during periods of illness or other stress. Genetics Mutations in the ASL gene cause argininosuccinic aciduria. Argininosuccinic aciduria belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions in the cells of the liver. It processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. In argininosuccinic aciduria, the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, involved in the conversion of arginino succinate to arginine within the urea cycle, is damaged or missing. The urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia. Ammonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, so argininosuccinic aciduria causes neurological problems as well as eventual damage to the liver. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based mainly on clinical findings and laboratory test results. Plasma concentrations of ammonia (>150 Œºmol/L) and citrulline (200-300 Œºmol/L) are elevated. Elevated levels of argininosuccinic acid (5-110 Œºmol/L) in the plasma or urine are diagnostic. Molecular genetic testing confirms diagnosis. Newborn screening for ASA is available in the U.S. and parts of Australia, and is considered in several European countries Treatment During an acute hyperammonemic episode, oral proteins must be avoided and intravenous (I.V.) lipids, glucose and insulin (if needed) should be given to promote anabolism. I.V. nitrogen scavenging therapy (with sodium benzoate and/or sodium phenylacetate) should normalize ammonia levels, but if unsuccessful, hemodialysis is recommended. Long-term management involves dietary protein restriction as well as arginine supplementation. In those with frequent episodes of metabolic decompensation or with hyperammonemia even when following a protein-restricted diet, daily oral nitrogen scavenging therapy may be successful. Orthotopic liver transplantation offers long-term relief of hyperammonemia but does not seem to sufficiently correct neurological complications. Arterial hypertension can be treated by restoring nitric oxide deficiency  Prognosis  Due to the rarity of the disease, it is hard to estimate mortality rates or life expectancy. One 2003 study which followed 88 cases receiving two different kinds of treatment found that very few persons lived beyond age 20 and none beyond age 30. Incidence Argininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 live births. Many patients can now be detected on the newborn screen if their blood citrulline is elevated.

Cricket career Charlton was regarded as an all-rounder, but he was more successful with his fast-medium bowling than with his batting. He was also an excellent slips fieldsman.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, pp. 104‚Äì5. A return of 7 for 44 against South Australia in February 1890 led to his selection in the Australian team to tour England later that year. In his two Test matches in England, he didn't score many runs (6,2,10,11) but can claim the \\"honour\\" of being dismissed LBW to WG Grace in the second innings of the first test. Charlton didn't bowl in the first test, however in the first innings of the second he took 3 wickets for 18 runs off 6 overs. Unfortunately, he didn't get a decent opportunity to bowl as it seems in this early period of cricket both teams had a strong tendency to bowl their two top bowlers \\"into the ground\\". For example, Australia's two top bowlers in the second innings of the first test bowling 48 overs between them with only Charlton bowling the other 6. This was more the rule than the exception at least during this series. He played cricket for many years for I Zingari, and served as the club's president from 1928 to 1947, and its patron from 1947 till his death in 1950. He was then made its patron in perpetuity.

She noted, for example, that problems of hygiene, security, and poor infrastructure constitute handicaps for the industry in Indonesia.'Lack of hygiene, infrastructure dog tourism', The Jakarta Post, 13 February 2012. She discussed the need for a strategy to develop the tourist sector.Shoeb K.

In late 2012 Pangestu expressed the hope that up to 10 million foreign tourists would visit Indonesia in 2014. She noted that there had been a falling away of tourists visiting Indonesia from Europe following the economic problems in 2011 and 2012 in the eurozone. However, she said that the government hoped that foreign tourist arrivals from countries in the Asia- Pacific region would hopefully offset the fall in tourists from Europe. She particularly pointed to the importance of the Chinese market where, she said, outbound tourists had climbed to 70 million in 2011.Nurfika Osman, 'Foreign tourists could reach 10 million in 2014, Mari says', The Jakarta Post, 26 November 2012. Creative economy After being given responsibility for creative economy matters in 2011, Pangestu was energetic in promoting a wide range of activities in the sector. She urged regional governments to promote local creative activities and spoke of the importance of strengthening intellectual property rights so as to encourage young Indonesian artists and creative entrepreneurs to develop Indonesian products. In November 2012, with the support of the Panglaykim Foundation, she supported the visit of creative economy author John Howkins to Jakarta to discuss policies to promote creative economy activities.'Look Local for Growth in Creative Sector: Mari', The Jakarta Globe, 24 November 2012. Professional background Born in Jakarta, Pangestu obtained her bachelor's and master's degrees from the Australian National University, and her Doctorate in economics from the University of California at Davis, United States, in 1986. Before being appointed as Minister of Trade in 2004 she was a leading staff member of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta and active over a long period in various trade forums such as PECC. She is regarded as one of the most well-known economic experts on trade issues in Indonesia. She has also served as an instructor in the Faculty of Economics & Business in the University of Indonesia. Pangestu is widely respected both in Indonesia and overseas. She is known as an effective public speaker and minister. As Minister for Trade she was sometimes criticised by domestic industry groups for supporting trade-promotion measures rather than looking to increase protection for domestic producers.Linda Yulisman, 'Businesses greet Mari's ouster, Dahlan's new role', The Jakarta Post, 18 October 2011. Her response to these criticisms was to note that Indonesia needed to adhere to international commitments to promote trade-oriented policies and that freer trade brought many benefits to domestic consumers and producers in Indonesia.Rangga D.

Early life Lorimer was born in Edinburgh, the son of Hannah Stodart (1835-1916) and James Lorimer, who was Regius Professor of Public Law at University of Edinburgh from 1862 to 1890. In his youth the family lived at 21 Hill Street, a Georgian house in Edinburgh's South Side, close to where his father worked at Old College. From 1877 to 1882 he was educated at Edinburgh Academy, going on to study at University of Edinburgh from 1882 to 1885, however he left without completing his studies. He was part of a talented family, being the younger brother of painter John Henry Lorimer, and father to the sculptor Hew Lorimer. In 1878 the Lorimer family acquired the lease of Kellie Castle in Fife and began its restoration for use as a holiday home. Lorimer began his architectural career in 1885 working for Sir Robert Rowand Anderson in Edinburgh, and in 1889 for George Frederick Bodley in London. He returned to Edinburgh opening his own practice in 1891. His first major restoration commission was Earlshall Castle in Fife for Robert MacKenzie, a friend of his parents. He was influenced by Scottish domestic architecture of the 16th and 17th centuries and the Scottish baronial style of Kellie Castle where he had spent much of his childhood and adolescence. From his time in Bodley's office, Lorimer was influenced by the ideas of William Morris, and went on to become a committed exponent of the Arts and Crafts approach to architecture. He assembled a collaborative group of artists and craftsmen who, collectively, often contributed to his various commissions and to the manufacture of furniture sent to the Arts and Crafts exhibitions in London. In 1896 he was elected to the Art Workers Guild. Lorimer designed a series of cottages in the Arts and Crafts style in the Colinton area of Edinburgh, the so-called \\"Colinton Cottages\\". Constructed using traditional methods and materials, each cottage included a garden layout and interior design, including furniture, in keeping with the Arts and Crafts concept. By 1900, eight cottages had been built and four others were under construction. As his reputation grew the scale of his commissions increased, including major alterations and additions to important houses in various styles, culminating in three entirely new country houses designed in his personal interpretation of Scots baronial style; at Rowallan Castle, Ayrshire (1903), Ardkinglas, Argyll (1906), and Formakin House, Renfrewshire (1912). Of these, Ardkinglas, on Loch Fyne, was the only one built as originally designed and, Lorimer having been given carte blanche, represents his masterpiece. His important restorations at this time include Lennoxlove House, Haddington (1912) and probably his most evocative; at Dunderave Castle, Argyllshire (1912) on the Ardkinglas estate. He could take a house of modest character and give it a strong personality, such as Pitkerro, Forfarshire (1902) or Briglands, Kinross (from 1903), particularly where he found the raw materials sympathetic, but he could also disregard existing architectural qualities in a way that modern conservation practice would question, if he felt the result justified its replacement, such as at Hill of Tarvit, Fife (1907) where he demolished a previous house probably by Sir William Bruce, or at Marchmont, Berwickshire (1914) where he re-configured an altered house by William Adam (from 1750), ignoring Adam's design. He was called in to a number of properties to carry out a range of improvements, such as minor alterations, design of interiors and furnishings, work to ancillary buildings, and garden designs and features. A good representative of this sort of work is Hunterston Castle in Ayrshire (1912). Later life Lorimer's house at 54 Melville Street, Edinburgh The Lorimer family grave, Newburn, Fife The First World War restricted the demand for large new houses and his attention shifted to smaller scale projects, war memorials, and restorations. He already had a reputation as one of Scotland's leading restoration architects following the restoration of Earlshall and Dunderave, and he went on to carry out significant alteration and restoration works at Dunrobin Castle in Sutherland following a fire (1915), and at Balmanno Castle in Perthshire (1916), said to have been the only one of his commissions he would like to have lived in. Although much of his work, and reputation, was in the sphere of domestic architecture, Lorimer also carried out significant public works. Principal amongst these include his design for the new chapel for the Knights of the Thistle in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh in 1911. He received a knighthood for his efforts and went on to gain the commission for the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle in 1919, subsequently opened by the Prince of Wales in 1927. Following the completion of the memorial, Lorimer was in December 1927 appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). He designed the Doiran Memorial and the three great naval memorials to the missing: Portsmouth Naval Memorial, Plymouth Naval Memorial and Chatham Naval Memorial, each of which is a Grade I Listed Building. Lorimer was also responsible for St Andrew's Garrison Church, Aldershot, completed 1927, a large Army church dedicated to the soldiers of the Church of Scotland and kindred churches who lost their lives in World War One. In 1928, he returned to complete St Peter's Church in Morningside, Edinburgh, which he had designed in 1905.Edinburgh, Morningside, 77 Falcon Avenue, St Peter's Roman Catholic Church And Presbytery House from Canmore, retrieved 20 July 2017 One of his last works (completed posthumously) was Knightswood St Margaret's Parish Church, Glasgow, which was dedicated in 1932. Lorimer became President of the professional body in Scotland, the Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and it was during his tenure in office that the body received its second royal charter, permitting use of the term 'Royal' in the title. Lorimer was a fellow of the North British Academy of Arts. Ironically Lorimer lived in a mid-19th century town-house designed by Robert Brown, 54 Melville Street in Edinburgh, but Lorimer did heavily remodel the building when he bought it in 1903, adding small window panes, an extra attic storey, and central French doors on the frontage leading to a small balcony. He lived here for his last 26 years, though he died at 12 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh in 1929. He was cremated at the newly opened Warriston Crematorium and his ashes were thereafter buried with his parents at Newburn in rural south-east Fife, close to the family home of Kellie Castle. The grave (which he had designed himself at the death of his father) lies in the extreme south-west corner of this tiny and very remote churchyard, overlooking rural Fife towards the Firth of Forth. World War One work Over and above the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle, Lorimer was responsible for the simple and elegant design of the Commonwealth gravestone and for the design of several CWGC cemeteries in Germany (for PoWs dying in captivity) and in the Middle East. In 1918, Lorimer was appointed Principal Architect to the Imperial War Graves Commission. Between 1919 and 1927, he designed over three hundred war memorials in Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Macedonia, Egypt, Palastine and one in Queenstown in South Africa. Cemeteries by Lorimer include: Bordighera (Italy); Campo Santo in Genoa (Italy); Monte Sunio, Caltrano near Venice (Italy); Savara (Italy); Taranto (Italy); Chatby (Egypt); El Arish (Egypt); Hadra near Alexandria (Egypt); Ismailia (Egypt); Kantara (Egypt); Minia (Egypt); Tel El-Kabir (Egypt); Lake Dorian (North Macedonia); Baranthal, Asiago near Vernice (Italy); Boscon, Asiago near Venice (Italy); Cairo War Cemetery (Italy); Cavalletto, Asiago near Venice (Italy); Doiran (Greece); Granezza, Asiago near Venice (Italy); Karasouli (Salonika); Hortakoi, Kirechkoi (Thessalonika); Lahana (Thessalonika); Magnaboschi, Asiago near Venice (Italy); Montecchio Precalcino near Venice (Italy); Port Said (Egypt); Salonika; Sarigol near Kriston (Greece}; Struma near Kalokastron (Greece}; Suez (Egypt); Stahnsdorf POW cemetery near Berlin (Germany); Colonial Hill (North Macedonia); Delijski Vis, Palilula, Nis, Serbia; Niederzwehren POW cemetery near Berlin (Germany); Ohlsdorf POW cemetery near Hamburg (Germany); Suedfriedhof POW cemetery near Cologne (Germany); Zehrensdorf POW cemetery near Brandenburg (Germany).

New Hampshire was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. Founding: 17th century‚Äì1775 Fort William and Mary in 1705 Various Algonquian-speaking Abenaki tribes, largely divided between the Androscoggin and Pennacook nations, inhabited the area before European settlement. Despite the similar language, they had a very different culture and religion from other Algonquian peoples. English and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600‚Äì1605, and David Thompson settled at Odiorne's Point in present-day Rye in 1623. The first permanent settlement was at Hilton's Point (present-day Dover). By 1631, the Upper Plantation comprised modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham; in 1679, it became the \\"Royal Province\\". Father Rale's War was fought between the colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy throughout New Hampshire. The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on the division in 1629 of a land grant given in 1622 by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason (former governor of Newfoundland) and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire by Mason after the English county of Hampshire, one of the first Saxon shires. Hampshire was itself named after the port of Southampton, which was known previously as simply \\"Hampton\\". New Hampshire was first settled by Europeans at Odiorne's Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) by a group of fishermen from England under David Thompson in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. Early historians believed the first native-born New Hampshirite, John Thompson, was born there. Fisherman David Thompson had been sent by Mason, to be followed a few years later by Edward and William Hilton. They led an expedition to the vicinity of Dover, which they called Northam. Mason died in 1635 without ever seeing the colony he founded. Settlers from Pannaway, moving to the Portsmouth region later and combining with an expedition of the new Laconia Company (formed 1629) under Captain Neal, called their new settlement Strawbery Banke. In 1638 Exeter was founded by John Wheelwright. In 1631, Captain Thomas Wiggin served as the first governor of the Upper Plantation (comprising modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham). All the towns agreed to unite in 1639, but meanwhile Massachusetts had claimed the territory. In 1641 an agreement was reached with Massachusetts to come under its jurisdiction. Home rule of the towns was allowed. In 1653 Strawbery Banke petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts to change its name to Portsmouth, which was granted. Map showing several claims and disputed borders between 1691-1775 The relationship between Massachusetts and the independent New Hampshirites was controversial and tenuous, and complicated by land claims maintained by the heirs of John Mason. In 1679 King Charles II separated New Hampshire from Massachusetts, issuing a charter for the royal Province of New Hampshire, with John Cutt as governor. New Hampshire was absorbed into the Dominion of New England in 1686, which collapsed in 1689. After a brief period without formal government (the settlements were de facto ruled by Massachusetts) William III and Mary II issued a new provincial charter in 1691. From 1699 to 1741 the governors of Massachusetts were also commissioned as governors of New Hampshire. The province's geography placed it on the frontier between British and French colonies in North America, and it was for many years subjected to native claims, especially in the central and northern portions of its territory. Because of these factors it was on the front lines of many military conflicts, including King William's War, Queen Anne's War, Father Rale's War, and King George's War. By the 1740s most of the native population had either been killed or driven out of the province's territory. Because New Hampshire's governorship was shared with that of Massachusetts, border issues between the two colonies were not properly adjudicated for many years. These issues principally revolved around territory west of the Merrimack River, which issuers of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire charters had incorrectly believed to flow primarily from west to east. In the 1730s New Hampshire political interest led by Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth were able to raise the profile of these issues to colonial officials and the crown in London, even while Governor and Massachusetts native Jonathan Belcher preferentially granted land to Massachusetts interests in the disputed area. In 1741 King George II ruled that the border with Massachusetts was approximately what it is today, and also separated the governorships of the two provinces. Benning Wentworth in 1741 became the first non-Massachusetts governor since Edward Cranfield succeeded John Cutt in the 1680s. Wentworth promptly complicated New Hampshire's territorial claims by interpreting the provincial charter to include territory west of the Connecticut River, and began issuing land grants in this territory, which was also claimed by the Province of New York. The so-called New Hampshire Grants area became a subject of contention from the 1740s until the 1790s, when it was admitted to the United States as the state of Vermont. =Slavery in New Hampshire= As in the other Thirteen Colonies and elsewhere in the colonial Americas, racially conditioned slavery was a firmly established institution in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire Assembly in 1714 passed \\"An Act To Prevent Disorders In The Night\\": Notices emphasizing and re-affirming the curfew were published in The New Hampshire Gazette in 1764 and 1771. \\"Furthermore, as one of the few colonies that did not impose a tariff on slaves, New Hampshire became a base for slaves to be imported into America then smuggled into other colonies. Every census up to the Revolution showed an increase in black population, though they remained proportionally fewer than in most other New England colonies.\\" Following the Revolution, a powerfully-written petition of 1779 sent by 20 slaves in Portsmouth‚Äîmembers of what historian Ira Berlin identified as the of enslaved people in his pivotal work Many Thousands Gone‚Äîunsuccessfully requested freedom for the enslaved. The New Hampshire legislature would not officially eliminate slavery in the state until 1857, long after the death of many of the signatories. The 1840 United States Census was the last to enumerate any slaves in the households of the state. While the number of slaves resident in New Hampshire itself dwindled during the course of the 19th century, the state's economy remained closely interlinked with, and dependent upon, the economies of the slave states. Slave-produced raw materials, such as cotton for textiles, and slave-manufactured goods were imported. The ship Nightingale of Boston, built in Eliot, Maine in 1851 and outfitted in Portsmouth, would serve as a slave ship before its capture by the African Slave Trade Patrol in 1861, indicating the region's further economic connection to the ongoing Atlantic slave trade. Revolution: 1775‚Äì1815 John Wentworth, January 1776 New Hampshire was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule during the American Revolution. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress called upon the other New England colonies for assistance in raising an army. In response, on May 22, 1775, the New Hampshire Provincial Congress voted to raise a volunteer force to join the patriot army at Boston. In January 1776, it became the first colony to set up an independent government and the first to establish a constitution, but the latter explicitly stated \\"we never sought to throw off our dependence on Great Britain\\", meaning that it was not the first to actually declare its independence (that distinction instead belongs to Rhode Island). The historic attack on Fort William and Mary (now Fort Constitution) helped supply the cannon and ammunition for the Continental Army that was needed for the Battle of Bunker Hill that took place north of Boston a few months later. New Hampshire raised three regiments for the Continental Army, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd New Hampshire regiments. New Hampshire Militia units were called up to fight at the Battle of Bunker Hill, Battle of Bennington, Saratoga Campaign and the Battle of Rhode Island. John Paul Jones' ship the Sloop-of-war USS Ranger and the frigate USS Raleigh were built in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, along with other naval ships for the Continental Navy and privateers to hunt down British merchant shipping. Concord was named the state capital in 1808. Order by John Taylor Gilman, State Treasurer and later Governor, 1784 Industrialization, abolitionism and politics: 1815‚Äì1860 Map of the Republic of Indian Stream In 1832, New Hampshire saw a major news story: the founding of the Republic of Indian Stream on its northern border with Canada over the unresolved post-revolutionary war border issue. In 1835 the republic was annexed by New Hampshire, with the dispute finally resolved in 1842 by the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty. Abolitionists from Dartmouth College founded the experimental, interracial Noyes Academy in Canaan, New Hampshire in 1835, at a point in history when slaves still appeared in the households of the state in the national census and decades before the abolition of slavery in the state. Rural opponents of the school eventually dragged the school away with oxen before lighting it ablaze to protest integrated education, within months of the school's founding. Abolitionist sentiment was a strong undercurrent in the state, with significant support given the Free Soil Party of John P. Hale. However the conservative Jacksonian Democrats usually maintained control, under the leadership of editor Isaac Hill. In 1856 the new Republican Party headed by Amos Tuck produced a political revolution. Civil War: 1861‚Äì1865 After Abraham Lincoln gave speeches in March 1860, he was well regarded. However, the radical wing of the Republican Party increasingly took control. As early as January 1861, top officials were secretly meeting with Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts to coordinate plans in case the war came. Plans were made to rush militia units to Washington in an emergency.Richard F. Miller, ed., States at war: a reference guide for Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont in the Civil War (2013) 1: 368-69 New Hampshire fielded 31,650 enlisted men and 836 officers during the American Civil War; of these, 1,803 enlisted men and 131 officers were killed or wounded.Bruce D. Heald, New Hampshire and the Civil War: Voices from the Granite State (History Press, 2012). The state provided eighteen volunteer infantry regiments (thirteen of which were raised in 1861 in response to Lincoln's call to arms), three rifle regiments (who served in the 1st United States Sharpshooters and 2nd United States Sharpshooters), one cavalry battalion (the 1st New Hampshire Volunteer Cavalry, which was attached to the 1st New England Volunteer Cavalry), and two artillery units (the 1st New Hampshire Light Battery and 1st New Hampshire Heavy Artillery), as well as additional men for the Navy and Marine Corps. Among the most celebrated of New Hampshire's units was the 5th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Colonel Edward Ephraim Cross.Mike Pride & Mark Travis, My Brave Boys: To War with Colonel Cross and the Fighting Fifth, University Press of New England, 2001. Called the \\"Fighting Fifth\\" in newspaper accounts, the regiment was considered among the Union's best both during the war (Major General Winfield Scott called the regiment \\"refined gold\\" in 1863) and by historians afterward. The Civil War veteran and early Civil War historian William F. Fox determined that this regiment had the highest number of battle-related deaths of any Union regiment. The 20th-century historian Bruce Catton said that the Fifth New Hampshire was \\"one of the best combat units in the army\\" and that Cross was \\"an uncommonly talented regimental commander.\\" The critical post of state Adjutant General was held in 1861-64 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792-1873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816-1891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state had no track of men who enlisted after 1861; no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees. There was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828-1883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As a result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.Miller, ed., States at war (2013) 1: 366-7 Prosperity, depression and war: 1865‚Äì1950 1922 map of New Hampshire published in the bulletin of the Brown Company in Berlin Between 1884 and 1903, New Hampshire attracted many immigrants. French Canadian migration to the state was significant, and at the turn of the century, French Canadians represented 16 percent of the state's population, and one-fourth the population of Manchester.Wilfrid H. Paradis, Upon This Granite: Catholicism in New Hampshire, 1647-1997 (1998), pp. 111-12. Polish immigration to the state was also significant; there were about 850 Polish Americans in Manchester in 1902. The textile industry was hit hard by the depression and growing competition from southern mills. The closing of the Amoskeag Mills in 1935 was a major blow to Manchester, as was the closing of the former Nashua Manufacturing Company mill in Nashua in 1949 and the bankruptcy of the Brown Company paper mill in Berlin in the 1940s, which led to new ownership. Modern New Hampshire: 1950‚Äìpresent The post-World War II decades have seen New Hampshire increase its economic and cultural links with the greater Boston, Massachusetts, region. This reflects a national trend, in which improved highway networks have helped metropolitan areas expand into formerly rural areas or small nearby cities. The replacement of the Nashua textile mill with defense electronics contractor Sanders Associates in 1952 and the arrival of minicomputer giant Digital Equipment Corporation in the early 1970s helped lead the way toward southern New Hampshire's role as a high-tech adjunct of the Route 128 corridor. The postwar years saw the rise of New Hampshire's political primary for President of the United States, which as the first primary in the quadrennial campaign season draws enormous attention.

The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy‚Äîas distinguished from the political project on which the ID movement is based‚Äîemerged from the work of Greek-born political philosopher, economist, activist and former academic Takis Fotopoulos, in the book Towards An Inclusive Democracy, and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal Democracy & Nature and its successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, an electronic journal published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.\\"International Journal of Inclusive Democracy\\" The Alternative Press Center In other words, the theoretical project of ID is a project emerging in Political Philosophy about social change (see e.g. Marxism, Social Ecology project, the autonomy project, the Inclusive Democracy project, etc.). On the other hand, the political project of ID (as any political project for social emancipation) is a project emerging in the History of social struggle (e.g. along socialist movement, autonomist movement, classical (direct) democracy movement, etc.). According to Arran Gare, Towards an Inclusive Democracy \\"offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism\\".Arran Gare, \\"Beyond Social Democracy? Takis Fotopoulos' Vision of an Inclusive Democracy as a New Liberatory Project\\" Democracy & Nature, Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003), pp. 345‚Äì58 David Freeman argues that Fotopoulos' approach in that book \\"is not openly anarchism, yet anarchism seems the formal category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy, municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy\\".Freeman, David, \\"Inclusive democracy and its prospects\\" review of book Towards An Inclusive Democracy: The Crisis of the Growth Economy and the Need For a New Liberatory Project, published in Thesis Eleven no. 69 (Sage Publications, May 2002), pp. 103‚Äì06.  Conception of Inclusive Democracy  Fotopoulos describes Inclusive Democracy as \\"a new conception of democracy, which, using as a starting point the classical definition of it, expresses democracy in terms of direct political democracy, economic democracy (beyond the confines of the market economy and state planning), as well as democracy in the social realm and ecological democracy. In short, inclusive democracy is a form of social organisation which re- integrates society with economy, polity and nature. The concept of inclusive democracy is derived from a synthesis of two major historical traditions, the classical democratic and the socialist, although it also encompasses radical green, feminist, and liberation movements in the South\\".\\"Inclusive Democracy\\" entry in Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy, ed. by R.J. Barry Jones, 2001, pp. 732‚Äì33. The starting point of the ID project is that the world, at the beginning of the new millennium, faces a multi- dimensional crisis (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political), which is shown to be caused by the concentration of power in the hands of various elites. This is interpreted to be the outcome of the establishment, in the last few centuries, of the system of market economy (in the Polanyian sense),Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation, the Political and Economic Origins of Our Time, (Beacon Press, 1944/1957), pp. 43‚Äì44, 55‚Äì56. Representative democracy, and the related forms of hierarchical structure. Therefore, an inclusive democracy is seen not simply as a utopia, but perhaps as the only way out of the crisis, based on the equal distribution of power at all levels. In this conception of democracy, the public realm includes not just the political realm, as is usual the practice in the republican or democratic project (Hannah Arendt, Cornelius Castoriadis, Murray Bookchin et al.),Ingerid S. Straume, \\"A Common World? Arendt, Castoriadis and Political Creation,\\" European Journal of Social Theory, Vol. 15, No. 3 (August 2012), pp. 367‚Äì83.Murray Bookchin, Urbanization without Cities (Montreal: Black Rose, 1992), p. 11. but also the economic, 'social' and ecological realms. The political realm is the sphere of political decision-making, the area in which political power is exercised. The economic realm is the sphere of economic decision-making, the area in which economic power is exercised with respect to the broad economic choices that any scarcity society has to make. The social realm is the sphere of decision-making in the workplace, the education place and any other economic or cultural institution which is a constituent element of a democratic society. The public realm could be extended to include the \\"ecological realm\\", which may be defined as the sphere of the relations between society and nature. Therefore, the public realm, in contrast to the private realm, includes any area of human activity in which decisions can be made collectively and democratically. According to these four realms, we may distinguish between four main constituent elements of an inclusive democracy: the political, the economic, 'democracy in the social realm' and the ecological. The first three elements form the institutional framework, which aims at the equal distribution of political, economic and social power respectively. In this sense, these elements define a system, which aims at the effective elimination of the domination of human being over human being. Similarly, ecological democracy is defined as the institutional framework, which aims to eliminate any human attempt to dominate the natural world, in other words, the system, which aims to reintegrate humans and nature.  Institutional framework  =Political or direct democracy= The necessary condition for the establishment of a political democracy involves the creation of appropriate institutions, which secure an equal distribution of political power among all citizens. All political decisions (including those relating to the formation and execution of laws) are taken by the citizen body collectively and without representation. The citizen body of a particular geographical area consists of all residents beyond a certain age of maturity and irrespective of their gender, race, ethnic or cultural identity. The age of maturity is to be defined by the citizen body itself. The sufficient condition for the reproduction of a political democracy refers to the citizens' level of democratic consciousness and, as David Gabbard & Karen Appleton point out, \\"the responsibility of cultivating the democratic consciousness requisite to this conception of citizenship falls to paideia\\"David Gabbard & Karen Appleton, \\"The Democratic Paideia Project: Beginnings of an Emancipatory Paideia for Today\\", The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 2, No. 1 (September 2005). which involves not simply education but character development and a well-rounded knowledge and skills, i.e. the education of the individual as citizen, which alone can give substantive content to the public space. This is particularly so because democracy can only be grounded on the conscious choice of citizens for individual and collective autonomy. Thus it cannot be the outcome of any social, economic or natural \\"laws\\" or tendencies dialectically leading to it, let alone any divine or mystical dogmas and preconceptions. In this sense, neither representative democracy nor soviet democracy meet the conditions for political democracy, and are simply forms of political oligarchy, where political power is concentrated in the hands of various elites, i.e. professional politicians, and party bureaucrats respectively. The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. This is very close to the concept of the 'urban village' proposed today by supporters of de-growth economics.Clement Homs, \\"Localism and the city: the example of \\"urban villages\\", The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 3, No. 1 (January 2007). Retrieved 21 April 2014. However, apart from local decisions, many important decisions are to be made at the regional or confederal level. This is why, as Serge Latouche observes, the aim of Inclusive Democracy \\"presupposes a confederation of demoi\\" made up of small, homogenous units of around 30,000 people.Serge Latouche, \\"How do we learn to want less? The globe downshifted\\", Le Monde diplomatique (January 2006). Therefore, an inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy. The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates. Finally, political or direct democracy implies a very different conception of citizenship than the usual liberal and socialist conceptions. In this conception, political activity is not a means to an end, but an end in itself so that one does not engage in political action simply to promote one's welfare but to realize the principles intrinsic to political life, such as freedom, equality and solidarity. This, in contrast to the liberal and social-democratic conceptions which adopt an 'instrumentalist' view of citizenship, i.e. a view which implies that citizenship entitles citizens with certain rights that they can exercise as means to the end of individual welfare. =Economic democracy and the role of an artificial market= The ID project introduced a very different conception from the usual one of economic democracy. According to the ID project, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere‚Äîwhich requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all 'macro' economic decisions, namely, decisions concerning the running of the economy as a whole (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used, etc.) are made by the citizen body collectively and without representation. However, \\"micro\\" economic decisions at the workplace or the household levels are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers. As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy today is only feasible at the level of the confederated demoi. It involves the ownership and control of the means of production by the demos. This is radically different from the two main forms of concentration of economic power : capitalist and 'socialist' growth economy. It is also different from the various types of collectivist capitalism, such as workers' control and milder versions suggested by post-Keynesian social democrats. The demos, therefore, becomes the authentic unit of economic life. For economic democracy to be feasible, three preconditions must be satisfied: Demotic self-reliance, demotic ownership of the means of production, and confederal allocation of resources. *Demotic self-reliance is meant in terms of radical decentralisation and collective self-sufficiency, in the sense of relying on the demos' resources rather than in the sense of autarky. *Demotic ownership of productive resources is a kind of ownership which leads to the politicisation of the economy, the real synthesis of economy and polity. This is so because economic decision making is carried out by the entire community, through the demotic assemblies, where people make the fundamental macro- economic decisions which affect the whole community, as citizens, rather than as vocationally oriented groups (e.g. workers, as e.g. in Parecon).Takis Fotopoulos, \\"Inclusive Democracy and Participatory Economics\\" , Democracy & Nature, Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003). At the same time, workers, apart from participating in the demotic decisions about the overall planning targets, would also participate (in the above broad sense of vocationally oriented groups) in their respective workplace assemblies, in a process of modifying/implementing the Democratic Plan and in running their own workplace. *Confederal allocation of resources is required because, although self- reliance allows many decisions to be made at the community level, much remains to be decided at the regional/national/supra-national level. However, it is delegates (rather than representatives) with specific mandates from the demotic assemblies who are involved in a confederal demotic planning process which, in combination with the proposed system of vouchers, effects the allocation of resources in a confederal inclusive democracy. A model of economic democracy, as an integral part of an inclusive democracy, is described in Towards An Inclusive Democracy (ch 6), the first book-length description of inclusive democracy. The main characteristic of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like Parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, money-less and market- less economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of: *(a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens‚Äîwhich requires that basic macro- economic decisions have to be made democratically, and *(b) securing freedom of choice‚Äîwhich requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume etc.). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: *(1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and the confederal assembly, and *(2) an artificial market using personal vouchers, which ensures freedom of choice but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although some have called this system \\"a form of money based on the labour theory of value\\",David Pepper, Modern Environmentalism (Routledge, 1996), p. 321. it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth. Another distinguishing feature of ID is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is according to need for basic needs, and according to effort for non-basic needs. ID is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast,Fotopoulos argues, Parecon follows the socialdemocratic rather than the anarcho-communist tradition and instead of proposing satisfaction according to need (as the ID project does) declares, first, that particular consumption needs such as health care or public parks will be free to all and, second, that as regards special needs, people will be able to make particular requests for need based consumption to be addressed case by case by others in the economy.Parecon: Life After Capitalism, Verso Books, 2003, p. 117. In fact, Michael Albert explicitly states that what he calls 'norm four', i.e. 'remuneration according to each person's need' should be applied only in exceptional cases of basic needs and not to all needs defined as such by the citizens' assemblies, as the Inclusive Democracy project declares. Thus, as Albert stresses: \\"beyond economic justice, we have our compassion, to be applied via norm four where appropriate such as in cases of illness, catastrophe, incapacity and so on\\".Parecon: Life After Capitalism, Verso Books, 2003, p. 38.  Artificial market  Proposed within Inclusive Democracy as a solution to the problem of maintaining freedom of choice for the consumer within a marketless and moneyless economy, an artificial market operates in much the same way as traditional markets, but uses labour vouchers or personal credit in place of traditional money. Because of the use of a labour voucher system in consumption of goods and services, an economy using an artificial market would have no actual flow of money and thus the only kind of market that could exist would be a market for commercial goods and services, eliminating capital markets and labour markets. According to Takis Fotopoulos, an artificial market \\"secures real freedom of choice, without incurring the adverse effects associated with real markets\\".Takis Fotopoulos, Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project, (London & NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 255. The idea of an artificial market was first proposed by the anarchist theorists Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin with their respective systems of Mutualism and collectivist anarchism. who suggested replacing traditional currency with a system of \\"labour-cheques\\" while still retaining basic market relations for goods and services. The artificial market however is rarely advocated as the only element for the allocation of goods and services by its proponents, as most also support a form of directly democratic planning for non-commercial goods and vital resources, and in some cases regulation of the artificial market through planning also. In the ID's system of allocation of resources, \\"the artificial market complements the envisaged direct democratic planning mechanism in the allocation of all goods and services on the basis of the crucial distinction introduced in this model between basic and nonbasic goods and services\\".Takis Fotopoulos, ‚ÄúBeyond the Market Economy and Statist Planning: Towards Democratic Planning as part of a Confederal Inclusive Democracy,‚Äù The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 6, No. 2/3 (Spring/Summer 2010). According to Fotopoulos, \\"the allocation of economic resources is made first, on the basis of the citizens' collective decisions, as expressed through the community and confederal plans, and second, on the basis of the citizens' individual choices, as expressed through a voucher system\\".Takis Fotopoulos, Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project, (London & NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 256. The proposed system of the artificial market aims at: *(A) meeting the basic needs of all citizens, and *(B) securing freedom of choice in a marketless, moneyless and stateless 'scarcity‚Äìsociety' which has not yet achieved universal autarky (self- sufficiency). The former requires that basic macro‚Äìeconomic decisions have to be taken democratically, whereas the latter requires the individual to take important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume, etc.). Both the macro‚Äìeconomic decisions and the individual citizens' decisions are envisaged as being implemented through a combination of democratic planning and an artificial market. But, while in the 'macro' decisions the emphasis will be on planning, the opposite will be true as regards the individual decisions, where the emphasis will be on the artificial market.Takis Fotopoulos, Outline of an Economic Model for an Inclusive Democracy, Democracy & Nature, Vol.3, No.3, (1997), pp. 27‚Äì38. Most artificial market proponents reject the traditional socialist adoption of the labour theory of value as they believe it cannot be used as the basis for allocating scarce resources. The reason given is that even if the labour theory of value can give a (partial) indication of availability of resources, it certainly cannot be used as a means to express consumers' preferences. Thus they feel that the labour theory of value cannot serve as the basis for an allocative system that aims at both meeting needs and, at the same time, securing consumer sovereignty and freedom of choice. Instead, the model proposed here is, in fact, a system of rationing, which is based on the revealed consumers' preferences on the one hand, and resource availability on the other.Takis Fotopoulos, Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project, (London & NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 261. Advocates of Participism and Parecon in particular reject markets in all forms in favour of democratic participatory planning. While Parecon also uses personal credit in place of money, prices are set according to the direct requests of consumers in democratic \\"consumer councils\\" whose demands are relayed to economic facilitation boards who determine and set final prices based on a combination of marginal utility and opportunity cost. On the other hand, as Fotopoulos argues, \\"no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone, however democratic and decentralized it is, can secure real self-management and freedom of choice.\\"Steven Best, Ed.,\\"Recent Theoretical Developments on the Inclusive Democracy Project\\" in \\"Global Capitalism and the Demise of the Left:Renewing Radicalism Through Inclusive Democracy,\\" The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 5, No. 1, special issue (winter 2009), p. 302. =Democracy in the social realm= An inclusive democracy is inconceivable unless it extends to the broader social realm to embrace the workplace, the household, the educational institution and indeed any economic or cultural institution, which constitutes an element of this realm. The equal distribution of power in these institutions and self- management are secured through the creation of assemblies of the people involved in each place of work or education (workers' assemblies, student and teachers' assemblies respectively) who make all important decisions about the functioning of these places, within the framework of the decisions taken by citizens' demotic assemblies as regards the general aims of production, education and culture respectively. The assemblies are federated at the regional and confederal levels so that the confederal assemblies of workers, teachers, students and so on could be involved in a process of constant interaction with the citizens' confederal assemblies to define society's \\"general interest\\". A crucial issue with respect to democracy in the social realm is democratisation of the household. One possible solution is the removal of the divide between the household and the public realm. Thus, some feminist writers, particularly eco-feminists, glorify the oikos and its values as a substitute for the polis and its politics. This can be understood as an attempt to dissolve the public into the private. At the other extreme, some Marxist feminists attempt to remove the public/private divide by dissolving all private space into a singular public, a socialised or fraternal state sphere. Another possible solution is, taking for granted that the household belongs to the private realm, to 'democratise' it in the sense that household relationships should take on the characteristics of democratic relationships, and that the household should take a form which is consistent with the freedom of all its members. But for the ID project, the issue is not the dissolution of the private/public realm divide. The real issue is how, maintaining and enhancing the autonomy of the two realms, such institutional arrangements are adopted that introduce democracy at the household and the social realm in general (workplace, educational establishment etcetera) and at the same time enhance the institutional arrangements of political and economic democracy. In this sense, an effective democracy is only conceivable if free time is equally distributed among all citizens, which requires ending the present hierarchical relations in the household, the workplace and elsewhere. Furthermore, democracy in the social realm, particularly in the household, requires institutional arrangements which recognise the character of the household as a need-satisfier and integrate the care and services that the household provides into the general scheme of needs satisfaction.Takis Fotopoulos, The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy, (English translation of a book under the same title published in Greek, Gordios, 2005), ch. 15. =Ecological democracy= Steven Best writes, > in bold contrast to the limitations of the animal advocacy movement (AAM) > and all other reformist causes, Takis Fotopoulos advances a broad view of > human dynamics and social institutions, their impact on the earth, and the > resulting consequences for society itself. Combining anti-capitalist, > radical democracy, and ecological concerns in the concept of \\"ecological > democracy,\\" Fotopoulos defines this notion as \\"the institutional framework > which aims at the elimination of any human attempt to dominate the natural > world, in other words, as the system which aims to reintegrate humans and > Nature. This implies transcending the present 'instrumentalist' view of > Nature, in which Nature is seen as an instrument for growth, within a > process of endless concentration of power.Steven Best,\\"Rethinking > Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the > Left\\", The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 2, No. 3 (June > 2006). Some critics of inclusive democracy ask what guarantees an inclusive democracy may offer in ensuring a better relationship of society to nature than the alternative systems of the market economy, or socialist statism. For example, David Pepper, an eco-socialist, pointed out \\"the 'required' ecological consensus among ecotopia's inhabitants might not be ensured merely by establishing an Athenian democracy where all are educated and rational\\".David Pepper, Modern Environmentalism, p. 324. However, ID supporters counter-argue that this criticism represents a clear misconception of what democracy is about because, > if we see it as a process of social self-institution where there is no > divinely or 'objectively' defined code of human conduct, such guarantees are > by definition ruled out. Therefore, the replacement of the market economy by > a new institutional framework of inclusive democracy constitutes only the > necessary condition for a harmonious relation between the natural and social > worlds. The sufficient condition refers to the citizens' level of ecological > consciousness. Still, the radical change in the dominant social paradigm > that would follow the institution of an inclusive democracy, combined with > the decisive role that paedeia will play in an environmentally-friendly > institutional framework, could reasonably be expected to lead to a radical > change in the human attitude towards Nature. Supporters also claim that ID's institutional framework offers the best hope for a better human relationship to nature than could ever be achieved in a market economy, or one based on socialist statism. The factors supporting this view refer to all three elements of an inclusive democracy: political, economic and social. Political democracy presupposes a radical decentralisation (physical or administrative) within a confederal society, which, by itself, should enhance its environmentally friendly character. Furthermore, political democracy would create a public space, a fact which would significantly reduce the appeal of materialism by providing a new meaning of life to fill the existential void that the present consumer society creates. Economic democracy replaces the dynamics of the capitalist market economy leading to growth per se with a new social dynamic aiming at the satisfaction of demos' needs. If the satisfaction of demotic needs does not depend, as at present, on the continuous expansion of production to cover the 'needs' that the market system itself creates and if society is reintegrated with the economy, then there is no reason why the present instrumentalist view of nature will continue conditioning human behaviour. Particularly so, since unlike socialist models which are 'centralist', the aim of production in an Inclusive Democracy is not economic growth, but the satisfaction of the basic needs of the community and those non-basic needs for which members of the community express a desire and are willing to work extra for. This implies a new definition of economic efficiency, based not on narrow techno-economic criteria of input minimisation/output maximisation as in socialist models like Parecon, but on criteria securing full coverage of the democratically defined basic needs of all citizens as well as of the non-basic needs they decide to meet, even if this involves a certain amount of inefficiency according to the orthodox economics criteria. According to ID supporters, democracy in the social realm should be a decisive step in the creation of the sufficient condition for a harmonious nature-society relationship, as the phasing out of patriarchal relations in the household and hierarchical relations in general should create a new ethos of non-domination which would engulf both nature and society.

Two accused individuals challenged the section as a violation of their right to the presumption of innocence under section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\\"Charter\\"). The Court upheld the section and provided a basis on which to interpret the section. Background On September 3, 1985, 15-year- old Robert Chaulk and 16-year-old Francis Morrissette burglarized a home in Winnipeg, and then stabbed and bludgeoned its sole occupant to death. One week later, they turned themselves in, making full confessions. The only defence raised was insanity within the meaning of section 16 of the Criminal Code. Expert evidence was given at trial that Chaulk and Morrissette suffered from a paranoid psychosis which made them believe they had the power to rule the world and that the killing was a necessary means to that end. They believed they were above the ordinary law and thought they had a right to kill the victim because he was \\"a loser\\". They were both convicted of murder by a jury in the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, which was upheld on appeal. The major questions to the Supreme Court were: # whether section 16(4) of the Criminal Code, which provides that, \\"Every one shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane,\\" infringes the presumption of innocence guaranteed in section 11(d) of the Charter and if so, it is justifiable under section 1 of the Charter; # whether the meaning of the term \\"wrong\\" in section 16(2) of the Code should be restricted to \\"legally wrong\\"; # whether section 16(3) of the Code provides an alternative defence if the conditions of section 16(2) were not met; and # whether the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to split its case by presenting its evidence with respect to the sanity of the accused in rebuttal. They were convicted of murder, but have appealed the decision on the basis of an error in instruction on the definition of the word \\"appreciate\\" and \\"wrong\\". Opinion of the Court There were three opinions: *Lamer - with Dickson, La Forest and Cory - held that section 16(4) violated section 11(d) of the Charter, but was saved under section 1. He also held that the judge erred in interpreting the word \\"wrong\\" in section 16(4). *Wilson held that section 16(4) violated 11(d) and was not justified by section 1. She also held that the judge erred in interpreting the word \\"wrong\\" and erred in his instructions to the jury regarding the defence. * Gonthier held that section 16(4) did not violate section 11(d) and that the judge erred in interpreting the word \\"wrong\\". The accused were convicted of first degree murder. The only defence raised at trial was insanity, but this defence was rejected by the jury. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. This appeal is to determine (1) whether section 16(4) of the Criminal Code, which provides that, \\"Every one shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane\\", infringes the presumption of innocence guaranteed in section 11(d) of the Charter; and, if so, whether section 16(4) is justifiable under section 1 of the Charter; (2) whether the meaning of the word \\"wrong\\" in section 16(2) of the Code should be restricted to \\"legally wrong\\"; (3) whether section 16(3) of the Code provides an alternative defence if the conditions of section 16(2) were not met; and (4) whether the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to split its case by presenting its evidence with respect to the sanity of the accused in rebuttal. Reasoning Lamer CJC explained that there is a presumption of criminal capacity. For a minor child, the reverse is true. For a child over age 14, the presumption of incapacity is rebuttable. A claim of insanity undermines the voluntariness of either the actus reus or the mens rea. It can also provide an excuse to criminal conduct, where intention is present. The defence can be raised in a number of ways, therefore. For example, the defence can plead insanity to show a lack of capacity to understand right and wrong, or to show a cognitive breakdown leading to an irresistible impulse to act. The focus is on incapacity to form a mental element ‚Äì a mentally disordered person does not have the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong. \\"Wrong\\" means more than legally wrong or knowing the law of the land; it means morally wrong as well. This decision overruled Schwartz v R.[1977] 1 SCR 673 The test requires that the defence establish that due to the mental illness, the accused could not appreciate that his conduct: \\"conformed to normal and reasonable standards of society\\" \\"breaches a standard of moral conduct\\" \\"would be condemned.\\" Lamer addresses the floodgates question. First, the presence of a mental disorder is required before this analysis is even undertaken. Second, moral standards are not judged on the personal standards of the accused. The mental disorder must inhibit the accused from appreciating society's standards of morality. The accused cannot substitute its own moral code and say that he was acting according to that code. Rationale A trial judge must instruct the trier of fact that \\"appreciate that the act was wrong\\" means that because of the mental disorder, the accused could not understand or comprehend society's moral condemnation of the conduct. Dissent There were two dissenting opinions: * McLachlin - with L'Heureux-Dub√© - held that section 16(4) did not violate section 11(d) of the Charter, and the trial judge did not err in any way. * Sopinka held that section 16(4) violated section 11(d) but was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter. He also agreed with McLachlin that the judge did not err. Aftermath Robert Chaulk was subsequently found not guilty by reason of insanity in a new trial. After four months of treatment, Robert Chaulk was found sane and released. In 1999, Robert Chaulk was accused of stabbing two of his neighbours to death on New Year's Day.

Virtuous [Sect] Founder (ie Patriach) Huynh), was the founder of the H√≤a H·∫£o religious tradition. Early years Born in the village of H√≤a H·∫£o, near Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc, Vietnam, French Indochina, in 1920, S·ªï was the son of a moderately wealthy peasant. Plagued in his youth by illness, he was a mediocre student and graduated from high school only because of his father's influence. He was a brave child, so his father sent him to N√∫i C·∫•m in the Seven Mountains to learn from a hermit who was both a mystic and a healer. After some training, S·ªï made his mark during a stormy night in May 1939, having returned to his village after his master's death.Fall, pp. 151‚Äì52 While in an agitated state, S·ªï appeared to have suddenly been cured of his illnessesHu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï profile Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and started to propound his religious teachings, which were based on Buddhism, on the spot. According to observers, he spoke for several hours spontaneously \\"with eloquence and erudition about the sublime dogmas of Buddhism ... The witnesses to this miracle, deeply impressed by the strange scene, became his first converts.\\" His simplified teachings were designed to appeal primarily to the poor and the peasants. He attempted to win supporters by cutting down on ceremonies and complex doctrines, eschewing the use of temples. He won over followers by offering free consultations and performing purported miracle cures with simple herbs and acupuncture, and preaching at street corners and canal intersections. He quickly built up a following in the southern Mekong Delta and was looked to by his disciples for guidance in their daily lifestyles. In a time of colonial occupation, a native religion appealed to the masses who were displaying nationalist sentiment. Unlike Gautama Buddha, S·ªï was Vietnamese. As a result, S·ªï became a nationalist icon and became a wanted man for the French colonial authorities, having gained 100,000 followers in less than a year. He predicted that politics would be the cause of his premature death. > The cult must stem much more from internal faith than from a pompous > appearance. It is better to pray with a pure heart before the family altar > than to perform gaudy ceremonies in a pagoda, clad in the robes of an > unworthy bonze. Proselytising and imprisonment In early 1940, after a few weeks in retreat to compose and put on paper oracles, prayers and teachings, S·ªï launched a major campaign through the Mekong Delta. He recruited tens of thousands of converts to his movement who followed him around in his travels. His reputation grew immensely after a series of his predictions came true: the outbreak of World War II, the fall of France to Nazi Germany, and the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. His prediction of a Japanese invasion prompted many rice farmers to desert their farms en masse and flee to the hills. The French derided him as the \\"mad bonze\\". As his movement became politicised, it began to attract aspiring politicians, with the likes of Huynh Cong Bo, a prominent landowner, and its future military commanders, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn So√°i and L√¢m Th√†nh Nguy√™n. Nguyen claimed that S·ªï had cured him from illness. Fearing anti- French demonstrations and revolts would occur as a result of S·ªï's following, Vichy French governor Jean Decoux decided to act. In August, S·ªï was detained in the psychiatric hospital at Ch·ª£ Qu√°n hospital near Saigon under the reasoning that he was a lunatic. S·ªï famously succeeded in converting his psychiatrist, Dr. Tam, who became an ardent supporter (Tam was later executed by the Vi·ªát Minh for his activities). A board of French psychiatrists declared him sane in May 1941, reporting that he was \\"a little maniacal, very ignorant even in Buddhist practices, but a big talker.\\" He was exiled upon his release to the coastal town of B·∫°c Li√™u in the far south. His key supporters were sent to a concentration camp in Nui Bara. The French restrictions strengthened his nationalist appeal, and B·∫°c Li√™u soon became a place of H√≤a H·∫£o pilgrimage, although it was far from the movement's strongholds.Buttinger, pp. 255‚Äì57. In 1942, the French could no longer withstand the growing popular reactions generated by S·ªï's oracular pronouncements and political instructions. They exiled him to Laos. By that time the Japanese had taken over French Indochina, but had left the French apparatus in place, intervening only when they saw fit. The Japanese intercepted the transfer of S·ªï with the help of some H√≤a H·∫£o followers and brought him back to Saigon. The Kempeitai kept him under protection and the Japanese authorities rebuffed French protests and demands for extradition by saying that he was held as a \\"Chinese spy\\".Buttinger, p. 259. He avoided accusations of being a Japanese collaborator by predicting their demise, but his contacts with them allowed his supporters to gain weapons. He was considered a mystic, much like rasputin himself.Fall, pp. 151‚Äì53. Military campaign In 1945, as the Japanese were defeated and Vietnam fell into a power vacuum, S·ªï ordered the creation of armed units for campaigns against the local administration, landowners and French colonial forces. This led to the H√≤a H·∫£o becoming less of a religious and more of a military-political movement, as people such as landowners converted in the hope that they could buy protection.Buttinger, p. 260. As the H√≤a H·∫£o began battling the French, they also came into conflict with other military organizations such as the Vi·ªát Minh and Cao ƒê√†i who were also fighting the French. The H√≤a H·∫£o were in control of most of the Mekong Delta and was unwilling to toe the Vi·ªát Minh line from Hanoi. On 9 September 1945, a confrontation arose when a band of 15,000 H√≤a H·∫£o, armed with hand-to-hand weapons, attacked the Vi·ªát Minh garrison at C·∫ßn Th∆°. With their antiquated weapons, S·ªï's men were slaughtered, losing thousands. S·ªï's brother and the brother of his commander So√°i were captured and executed. The return of French forces helped to keep the H√≤a H·∫£o and the Vi·ªát Minh apart, but the H√≤a H·∫£o periodically sought vengeance on the Vi·ªát Minh by tying sympathisers together and throwing them into the river to drown. The Vi·ªát Minh were worried by S·ªï's nationalist credentials and social structure, and attempted to co-opt him into a National Unified Front. It was dissolved in July 1946 after it was apparent that S·ªï would not follow the Vi·ªát Minh. S·ªï entered politics openly by creating the Viet Nam Democratic Socialist Party, known as the D√¢n X√£. This defiant move made him a target of the Vi·ªát Minh as relations deteriorated. Disappearance/Death The southern Vi·ªát Minh leader, Nguy·ªÖn B√¨nh, realising that S·ªï would not subordinate himself to the Vi·ªát Minh, set up a trap. S·ªï was caught and executed in April 1947 . His body was dissected into many small pieces and scattered so that his followers could not gather them and turn it into an object of veneration or as a shrine.Buttinger, pp. 409‚Äì11. Following his death, the H√≤a H·∫£o's political and military power diminished as the various commanders began infighting without a centralised leadership structure and without a leader ; it became basically a network of war lords, the most famous being Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn So√°i, named a \\"one-star General\\" by the French (a rank which does not exist in the French Army, so VƒÉn So√°i added a second one on his k√©pi), and Ba C·ª•t. To avenge the murder of So, the H√≤a H·∫£o joined the French in their fight against the Vi·ªát Minh, with numerous betrayals and re-rallyings (5 by Ba C·ª•t, who was eventually guillotined).

Recently described specimens from a different region of the Morrison Formation were assigned to Haplocanthosaurus in 2014. The study describing them noted that Haplocanthosaurus is known for certain from at least four specimens, assigned to H. priscus (CM 572), H. utterbacki (=H. priscus; CM 879), H. delfsi (CMNH 10380), and H. sp. (MWC 8028). Up to seven additional specimens have been assigned to Haplocanthosaurus? or Haplocanthosauridae indet. One potential specimen has been nicknamed \\"Big Monty,\\" for its discovery in Montana. It's been claimed to measure an incredible long. However, much controversy surrounds the specimen and, as such, little is truly known about it.https://www.inverse.com/article/17806-sauropod-dinosaur- discovery-montana-fossil-hunter-paleontology-nate-murphy Description Restoration of H. delfsi Haplocanthosaurus was one of the smallest sauropods of the Morrison. While some Morrison sauropods could reach lengths of over 20 meters (or over 66 feet), Haplocanthosaurus was smaller, reaching a total length of 14.8 meters (49 feet) and an estimated weight of . Haplocanthosaurus is known from many elements, mostly of vertebra. In the middle and cervical caudals of Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus, the intraprezygapophyseal lamina is separate from the root of the neural canal by a vertical midline lamina. In the last few caudals and the most cranial dorsals, the lateral edge of the prezygapophyseal lamina becomes widened and roughened. Hatcher (1901) interpreted this as forming the attachment area for the muscles from which the scapular blade was suspended.Weishample, D.B.; Dodson, P.; Osmolska, H. (2004). \\"The Dinosauria: Second Edition\\". Berkeley, University of California Press. 2: 266, 281-286, 288, 296-299, 302-302. The dorsoventrally elongate oval outlines are characteristic of Haplocanthosaurus with only Camarasaurus also possessing them. The parapophyses remaining as oval facets on the craniolateral margin, and the sacral spines 1-3 fused are also found in both Haplocanthosaurus and Camarasaurus. The Cetiosaurus specimen OUMNH J13695 has a low horizontal ridge on each of its lateral surfaces, creating a slightly subhexagonal transverse cross-section, and that feature is also seen on Cetiosauriscus, the anterior caudals of Haplocanthosaurus, and caudals 15-30 of Omeisaurus. Also, the area around the periphery of each articullar face is flattened, creating a ‚Äòbevelled‚Äô appearance, and also occurs in Haplocanthosaurus and Cetiosauriscus. =Distinguishing characteristics= Haplocanthosaurus is distinguished by dorsal vertebra lacking cranial centrodiapophyseal laminae. Also, it is distinguished by elongate intrapostzygapophyseal laminae, dorsoventrally directed dorsal transverse processes that approach the height of the neural spines, and the distal end of the scapular blade being dorsally and ventrally expanded. Classification H. priscus sacrum Specmen FHPR 1106 Haplocanthosaurus priscus was originally named Haplocanthus priscus by John Bell Hatcher in 1903. Soon after his original description, Hatcher came to believe the name Haplocanthus had already been used for a genus of acanthodian fish (Haplacanthus, named by Louis Agassiz in 1845), and was thus preoccupied. Hatcher re-classified his sauropod later in 1903, giving it the new name Haplocanthosaurus. However, the name was not technically preoccupied at all, since there was a variation in spelling: the fish was named Haplacanthus, not Haplocanthus. While Haplocanthus technically remained the valid name for this dinosaur, Hatcher's mistake was not noticed until many years after the name Haplocanthosaurus had become fixed in scientific literature. When the mistake was finally discovered, a petition was sent to the ICZN (the body which governs scientific names in zoology), which officially discarded the name Haplocanthus and declared Haplocanthosaurus the official name (ICZN Opinion #1633). Originally described as a \\"cetiosaurid\\", Jos√© Bonaparte decided in 1999 that Haplocanthosaurus differed enough from other sauropods to warrant its own family, the Haplocanthosauridae.Bonaparte, J. F. (1999). \\"An armoured sauropod from the Aptian of northern Patagonia, Argentina.\\" In Tomida, Y., Rich, T. H. & Vickers-Rich, P. (eds.), 1999. Proceedings of the Second Gondwanan Dinosaur Symposium, National Science Museum Monographs #15, Tokyo: 1-12. Phylogenetic studies have failed to clarify the exact relationships of Haplocanthosaurus with any certainty. Studies have variously found it to be more primitive than the neosauropods, a primitive macronarian (related to the ancestor of more advanced forms such as Camarasaurus and the brachiosaurids), or a very primitive diplodocoid, more closely related to Diplodocus than to titanosaurs, but more primitive than rebbachisaurids. In 2005, Darren Naish and Mike Taylor reviewed the various proposed positions of Haplocanthosaurus in their study of diplodocoid phylogeny. They found it could be a non- neosauropod eusauropod, a basal macronarian, or a basal diplodocoid. In 2011, an analysis by Whitlock recovered Haplocanthosaurus as the basalmost member of the Diplodocoidea, the third potentiality of Taylor & Naish. In 2015, a specimen-level phylogenetic analysis was published, finding Haplocanthosaurus to be a confirmed diplodocoid, either very basal, or more derived than rebbachisaurids. Their implied weighting cladogram is shown below.

On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle, parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument is intended to measure the time of day, correct to half a second and declination of the Sun and the other heavenly bodies. There were five Jantar Mantars in India, of which the largest is in Jaipur which features many instruments along with the world's largest stone sundial.

The path links with the Cheshire Gritstone Trail, the Heart of England Way and the North Worcestershire Path. The Way was opened in three stages by Staffordshire County Council between 1977 and 1983 and was resurveyed and refurbished with the assistance of the Ramblers' Association to mark the Association's 60th anniversary in 1995.  The route  Starting at Mow Cop Castle on gritstone hills on the edge of the Peak District in North Staffordshire, the Staffordshire Way follows the Staffordshire/Cheshire border northeast for to the summit of the Cloud (a route shared with the Gritstone Trail). It then traverses southeast through Staffordshire's countryside for passing through Leek, then along the Caldon Canal through the Churnet Valley to Rocester and Uttoxeter. The route then goes southwest through the Trent Valley, Shugborough Hall parkland and Cannock Chase (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) to Penkridge. From Penkridge it turns south passing near to Brewood and continuing southwest through the parkland of Chillington Hall and close to Weston Park. It then turns south again passing through Codsall, within half a mile of Perton and near to Patshull Hall and Pattingham. It then continues south near to Enville and Highgate Common before finishing at the dramatic sandstone ridge of Kinver Edge. The section between Rushton Spencer and Cannock Chase is now part of European walking route E2. The path connects with the North Worcestershire Path and the Worcestershire Way at Kinver Edge, the Heart of England Way at Cannock Chase, the Limestone Way at Rocester and the Gritstone Trail in north Staffordshire. Hazards It is recommended that you take an Ordnance Survey map when walking the Staffordshire Way as there are patches of the route that are poorly signposted. Parts of the route are frequented less than others and as such can become intensely boggy, especially after heavy and/or prolonged rainfall. As some parts of the route are across farm fields, expect the way ahead to be blocked by occasional herds of dairy cattle and itinerant horses.

It scrutinizes the sexual morality and class ideology of its day through successive encounters between pairs of characters (before or after a sexual encounter). By choosing characters across all levels of society, the play offers social commentary on how sexual contact transgresses class boundaries. Printed privately in 1900, it was not publicly performed until 1920, when it provoked strong reactions. The play's two titles ‚Äîin German Reigen and in French La Ronde‚Äî refer to a round dance, as portrayed in the English rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses. Publication and reception 1900 print of Reigen. 200 copies were printed. La Ronde was first printed in 1900 for private circulation amongst friends.Banham (1998, 969). In 1903, the first German- language edition was published in Vienna, selling some 40,000 copies, but was banned by the censors a year later. A German editor was found in 1908 to publish the play from Germany. In 1912 it was translated into French, and in 1920 into English and published as Hands Around. In 1917 an English translation written by Marya Mannes was published by Boni & Liveright, inc. A Dutch translation, by Jo van Ammers-K√ºller, was published in 1923 as Rondedans: tien dialogen. Schnitzler's play was not publicly performed until 23 December 1920 in Berlin and 1 February 1921 in Vienna. (An unauthorized production was staged earlier in Budapest in 1912.) The play elicited violent critical and popular reactions. Schnitzler suffered moralistic and personal attacks that became virulently anti-Semitic; he was attacked as a Jewish pornographer and the outcry came to be known as the \\"Reigen scandal.\\" Despite a 1921 Berlin court verdict that dismissed the charges of immorality, Schnitzler withdrew La Ronde himself from public production in German-speaking countries. The play remained popular in Russia, Czechoslovakia and especially in France, where it was twice adapted for the cinema, in 1950 and 1964. In 1982, forty years after Arthur Schnitzler's death, his son Heinrich Schnitzler released the play for German-language performances. In 1922, the psychoanalysis-founding Sigmund Freud wrote to Schnitzler: \\"You have learned through intuition ‚Äì though actually as a result of sensitive introspection ‚Äì everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons.\\" Plot outline The play is set in the 1890s in Vienna. Its dramatic structure consists of ten interlocking scenes between pairs of lovers. Each of its ten characters appears in two consecutive scenes (with one from the final scene, The Whore, having appeared in the first). ;Scenes: #The Whore and the Soldier #The Soldier and the Parlor Maid #The Parlor Maid and the Young Gentleman #The Young Gentleman and the Young Wife #The Young Wife and The Husband #The Husband and the Little Miss #The Little Miss and the Poet #The Poet and the Actress #The Actress and the Count #The Count and the Whore Adaptations =Theatrical adaptations= In 1981 the theatrical rights to Schnitzler's play fell temporarily out of copyright and several stage adaptations were crafted and performed. In 1982 the play had its British premiere at the Royal Exchange, Manchester directed by Casper Wrede with William Hope as The Young Man, Cindy O'Callaghan as The Nursemaid and Gabrielle Drake as The Young Married Woman. In 1989, Mih√°ly Kornis re-located its action to communist-era Hungary, rendering the Young Gentleman and the Husband as communist politicians. Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation Hello Again was produced off-Broadway in 1994. David Hare's The Blue Room re- located its action to contemporary London, where it was first staged at the Donmar Warehouse in 1998. There have been four notable gay versions of the story: Eric Bentley's Round 2 (1986) is set in New York in the 1970s; Jack Heifner's Seduction and Michael Kearns's pro-safe-sex piece Complications (2004) (Complications was remade as Dean Howell's film Nine Lives); and Joe DiPietro's Fucking Men (2008) (which is set in contemporary New York). Suzanne Bachner created an adaptation examining 21st-century mores, including, straight, gay, and bisexual characters entitled Circle. Circle opened its five-month off-Broadway run at The Kraine Theater on February 15, 2002, Horse Trade Theater Group presenting The John Montgomery Theatre Company production.

A new translation, translated by Lukas Raphael, directed by Joel Cottrell and designed by Amber Dernulc set in 1953, opened at The White Bear in London in August 2011. A new contemporary adaptation, by American playwright Steven Dietz, is called \\"American la Ronde\\". This version hews to the Schnitzler structure but updates the roles to more modern archetypes. It also leaves the gender of all roles at the discretion of the producing theatre. \\"American la Ronde\\" is published by Dramatists Play Service, New York. This adaptation, under its previous title 360 (round dance), was given a workshop production at the University of Texas at Austin in 2011.

G. van der Corput. It is constructed by reversing the base-n representation of the sequence of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). The b-ary representation of the positive integer n (‚â• 1) is : n=sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^k, where b is the base in which the number n is represented, and 0 ‚â§ dk(n) < b, i.e. the k-th digit in the b-ary expansion of n. The n-th number in the van der Corput sequence is : g_b(n)=sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}.  Examples  For example, to get the decimal van der Corput sequence, we start by dividing the numbers 1 to 9 in tenths (x/10), then we change the denominator to 100 to begin dividing in hundredths (x/100). In terms of numerator, we begin with all two-digit numbers from 10 to 99, but in backwards order of digits. Consequently, we will get the numerators grouped by the end digit. Firstly, all two-digit numerators that end with 1, so the next numerators are 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91. Then the numerators ending with 2, so they are 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92. An after the numerators ending in 3: 03, 13, 23 and so on...

The holotype specimen IGM 100/29 (Mongolian Academy of Sciences, Ulan Bator, Mongolia) consists of an almost complete and articulated but compressed skeleton, lacking only portions of the pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle, and hindlimbs. It was recovered in the Dundgovi Aimag (Eastern Gobi Province), from an exposure of the Shinekhudag Formation now part of the Khuren Dukh Formation which dates to the Mid-Late AlbianBarsbold, R. and Perle, A. (1984). [On first new find of a primitive orithomimosaur from the Cretaceous of the MPR]. Paleontologicheskii zhurnal, 2: 121-123 Other dinosaurs collected from the Shinekhudug Formation in Dundgovi include the ceratopsian Psittacosaurus mongoliensis. Description Restoration of H. okladnikovi by a nest Harpymimus was for the first time extensively described in a dissertation by Yoshitsugu Kobayashi in 2004.Kobayashi, Y., 2004, Asian ornithomimosaurs. PhD Thesis, Southern Methodist University. 340 pp In a 2005 article, Kobayashi and Barsbold diagnosed Harpymimus based on a number of anatomical characteristics, including eleven teeth in the front of the lower jaw (dentary), the transition between anterior and posterior tail vertebrae taking place at the eighteenth caudal, a triangular-shaped depression above the dorsal surface of a ridge on the shoulder blade (scapula) above the shoulder joint, a low ridge above a distinctive depression along back edge of the shoulder blade, and a small but deep collateral ligament fossa on the lateral condyle of metacarpal III (a hand bone). The skull of the type specimen of Harpymimus is virtually complete, but badly crushed, obscuring some anatomical detail. There is evidence of a beak covering the upper jaw which, in concert with the dentary teeth, was likely employed for grasping and holding food. Its general appearance was much like that of later ornithomimosaurs (long-necked, long arms with sharp grasping claws, and long legs). The teeth of Harpymimus differ from those of another basal ornithomimosaur, Pelecanimimus polyodon, in that they are restricted to the dentary, are cylindrical and separated by interdental plates, and number at least ten and perhaps eleven per side. Pelecanimimus possessed per side seventy-five dentary teeth in the lower jaw, as well as an additional thirty- seven teeth in the upper jaw (maxilla and premaxilla). The small teeth of Harpymimus were probably used only for grabbing and holding food items, unlike those of many other theropods, which were adapted to cutting or piercing prey. Of all the known ornithomimosaurs, only Harpymimus and Pelecanimimus retained teeth, a trait which is primitive (plesiomorphic) for the clade Ornithomimosauria. Other basal traits are the very short first metacarpal in the hand and a third metatarsal that, though pinched at the top, is at that point not excluded form the front surface of the metatarsus, so that the foot is not arctometatarsalian. The length of the skull is approximately 262 mm, more than twice its approximate height and less than half the length of the neck (approximately 600 mm).Kobayashi, Y. and Barsbold, R. (2005). \\"Anatomy of Harpymimus okladnikovi Barsbold and Perle 1984 (Dinosauria; Theropoda) of Mongolia.\\" In Carpenter, K. (ed.) The Carnivorous Dinosaurs. Indiana University Press: 97-126 Classification Skeletal diagram Harpymimus was originally assigned to the Harpymimidae. In their 2005 paper, Kobayashi and Barsbold also conducted a detailed cladistic analysis of Harpymimus and determined that Harpymimus is basal to the clade of Garudimimus brevipes plus Ornithomimidae, yet is more derived than Pelecanimimus polyodon. According to these researchers, the conclusions of the analysis supported the model that ornithomimosaurs originated in either eastern Asia or in Europe prior to the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous (130-125 million years ago), then migrated to North America during or at some time before the Late Cretaceous. In the description of Paraxenisaurus from Serrano-Bra√±as et al. (2020), their phylogenetic analysis recovered Harpymimus to be a basal deinocheirid.

Playing career Williams was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1950. His father was Samoan, and his mother a Rarotongan of Samoan descent. He was educated at Mt Albert Grammar School, where he started his rugby career. He became an All Black in 1970 as a wing and distinguished himself in the 1970 South African Rugby Tour where he was a sensation, scoring 14 tries in his 13 appearances and in the international series he scored in each of the first and fourth Tests. This was during apartheid, so with his parentage he was only able to tour after honorary white status was granted. Williams' international rugby career lasted from 1970 to 1978 in which he played 113 matches (including 38 international Tests) and scored 66 tries in all matches as an All Black (ten tries in Tests), which was a record until beaten by John Kirwan. Retirement After he retired from rugby, he coached a number of club sides in New Zealand. During the 1990s onwards, he has been the national rugby coach for Samoa. He is married and has two sons Gavin and Paul, who also play rugby union: Gavin plays internationally for Samoa and plays club for French side US Dax; and his other son Paul played for the Auckland Super Rugby side the Blues before playing for Sale in the English Premiership and debuting for Samoa in 2010.

With the Sesame Beginnings DVDs, we're providing parents and caregivers of children under two with content specifically designed to use media as a tool to further adult/child interaction.\\" The same \\"underviewing\\" of Sesame Street is what had earlier inspired show producers to add in the very young-targeted Elmo's World segment. The concept of the Sesame Street cast as babies was not entirely new, as \\"baby-ized\\" versions of characters were available as toys since at least the early-2000s. Many likened the line to previous series like Muppet Babies. =Controversy and criticism= The production of DVDs and other screen-based media for children under the age of two is extremely controversial. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under two be kept away from screen media and Sesame Beginnings has been criticized by a number of early childhood development experts who point to research suggesting that television viewing by babies can harm language development and sleep patterns. An April 23, 2006 article in The Washington Post quoted Harvard Medical School psychologist Susan Linn as saying \\"There is no evidence that media is beneficial for babies, and they are starting to find evidence that it may be harmful. Until we know for sure, we shouldn't risk putting them in front of the television.\\" Sesame Street Kids‚Äô Guide to Life has countered such criticism by pointing to their partnership with Zero to Three, a respected American nonprofit child-development and advocacy organization, to produce the DVDs and also that they were extensively researched and tested by respected experts in childhood development. However, one of Zero to Three's original founders, noted pediatrian T. Berry Brazelton, was among the signatories of a letter of protest that was submitted to Zero to Three calling on the organization to disassociate itself with the project.

Its only known member species, Heterodontosaurus tucki, was named in 1962 based on a skull discovered in South Africa. The genus name means \\"different toothed lizard\\", in reference to its unusual, heterodont dentition; the specific name honours G. C. Tuck, who supported the discoverers. Further specimens have since been found, including an almost complete skeleton in 1966. Though it was a small dinosaur, Heterodontosaurus was one of the largest members of its family, reaching between and possibly in length, and weighing between . The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular when viewed from the side. The front of the jaws were covered in a horny beak. It had three types of teeth; in the upper jaw, small, incisor-like teeth were followed by long, canine-like tusks. A gap divided the tusks from the chisel-like cheek-teeth. The body was short with a long tail. The five-fingered forelimbs were long and relatively robust, whereas the hind-limbs were long, slender, and had four toes. Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous and best-known member of the family Heterodontosauridae. This family is considered a basal (or \\"primitive\\") group within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs, while their closest affinities within the group are debated. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is thought to have been herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it was formerly thought to have been capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it is now thought to have been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus. History of discovery African heterodontosaurid localities: Tyinindini, Voyizane, and Tushielaw denote Heterodontosaurus finds The holotype specimen of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British‚ÄìSouth African expedition to South Africa and Basutoland (former name of Lesotho) in 1961‚Äì1962. Today, it is housed in the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain at an altitude of about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of Transkei (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton and Alan J. Charig. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of Austin Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischian dinosaurs were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a diamond saw, which damaged the specimen.Sereno, P.C. (2012). pp. 4‚Äì17. Skeletal diagram of SAM-PK-K1332 In 1966, a second specimen of Heterodontosaurus (SAM-PK-K1332) was discovered at the Voyizane locality, in the Elliot Formation of the Stormberg Group of rock formations, above sea level, on Krommespruit Mountain. This specimen included both the skull and skeleton, preserved in articulation (i.e. the bones being preserved in their natural position in relation to each other), with little displacement and distortion of the bones. The postcranial skeleton was briefly described by palaeontologists Albert Santa Luca, Crompton and Charig in 1976. Its forelimb bones had previously been discussed and figured in an article by the palaeontologists Peter Galton and Robert T. Bakker in 1974, as the specimen was considered significant in establishing that Dinosauria was a monophyletic natural group, whereas most scientists at the time, including the scientists who described Heterodontosaurus, thought that the two main orders Saurischia and Ornithischia were not directly related. The skeleton was fully described in 1980. SAM-PK-K1332 is the most complete heterodontosaurid skeleton described to date. Though a more detailed description of the skull of Heterodontosaurus was long promised, it remained unpublished upon the death of Charig in 1997. It was not until 2011 that the skull was fully described by the palaeontologist David B. Norman and colleagues. SAM-PK-K10487, a juvenile skull Other specimens referred to Heterodontosaurus include the front part of a juvenile skull (SAM-PK-K10487), a fragmentary maxilla (SAM-PK-K1326), a left maxilla with teeth and adjacent bones (SAM-PK-K1334), all of which were collected at the Voyizane locality during expeditions in 1966‚Äì1967, although the first was only identified as belonging to this genus in 2008. A partial snout (NM QR 1788) found in 1975 on Tushielaw Farm south of Voyizane was thought to belong to Massospondylus until 2011, when it was reclassified as Heterodontosaurus. The palaeontologist Robert Broom discovered a partial skull, possibly in the Clarens Formation of South Africa, which was sold to the American Museum of Natural History in 1913, as part of a collection that consisted almost entirely of synapsid fossils. This specimen (AMNH 24000) was first identified as belonging to a sub-adult Heterodontosaurus by Sereno, who reported it in a 2012 monograph about the Heterodontosauridae, the first comprehensive review article about the family. This review also classified a partial postcranial skeleton (SAM-PK-K1328) from Voyizane as Heterodontosaurus. However, in 2014, Galton suggested it might belong to the related genus Pegomastax instead, which was named by Sereno based on a partial skull from the same locality. In 2005, a new Heterodontosaurus specimen was found in a streambed near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape Province; it was the most complete individual known to date, but the rocks around it were too hard to fully remove. The specimen was therefore scanned at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2016, to help reveal the skeleton, and aid in future research of its anatomy and lifestyle. In 1970, palaeontologist Richard A. Thulborn suggested that Heterodontosaurus was a junior synonym of the genus Lycorhinus, which was named in 1924 with the species L. angustidens, also from a specimen discovered in South Africa. He reclassified the type species as a member of the older genus, as the new combination Lycorhinus tucki, which he considered distinct due to slight differences in its teeth and its stratigraphy. He reiterated this claim in 1974, in the description of a third Lycorhinus species, Lycorhinus consors, after criticism of the synonymy by Galton in 1973. In 1974, Charig and Crompton agreed that Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus belonged in the same family, Heterodontosauridae, but disagreed that they were similar enough to be considered congeneric. They also pointed out that the fragmentary nature and poor preservation of the Lycorhinus angustidens holotype specimen made it impossible to fully compare it properly to H. tucki. In spite of the controversy, neither party had examined the L. angustidens holotype first hand, but after doing so, palaeontologist James A. Hopson also defended generic separation of Heterodontosaurus in 1975, and moved L. consors to its own genus, Abrictosaurus. Description Size compared to a human Heterodontosaurus was a small dinosaur. The most complete skeleton, SAM-PK-K1332, belonged to an animal measuring about in length. Its weight was variously estimated at , , and in separate studies. The closure of vertebral sutures on the skeleton indicates that the specimen was an adult, and probably fully grown. A second specimen, consisting of an incomplete skull, indicates that Heterodontosaurus could have grown substantially larger ‚Äì up to a length of and with a body mass of nearly . The reason for the size difference between the two specimens is unclear, and might reflect variability within a single species, sexual dimorphism, or the presence of two separate species. The size of this dinosaur has been compared to that of a turkey. Heterodontosaurus was amongst the largest known members of the family Heterodontosauridae.Sereno, P.C. (2012). pp. 161‚Äì162. The family contains some of the smallest known ornithischian dinosaurs ‚Äì the North American Fruitadens, for example, reached a length of only . Following the description of the related Tianyulong in 2009, which was preserved with hundreds of long, filamentous integuments (sometimes compared to bristles) from neck to tail, Heterodontosaurus has also been depicted with such structures, for example in publications by the palaeontologists Gregory S. Paul and Paul Sereno. Sereno has stated that a heterodontosaur may have looked like a \\"nimble two-legged porcupine\\" in life. The restoration published by Sereno also featured a hypothetical display structure located on the snout, above the nasal fossa (depression).Sereno, P.C. (2012). p. 219. =Skull and dentition= Skull cast of SAM-PK-K1332 and skull diagram reconstruction The skull of Heterodontosaurus was small but robustly built. The two most complete skulls measured (holotype specimen SAM-PK-K337) and (specimen SAM-PK-K1332) in length. The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular when viewed from the side, with the highest point being the sagittal crest, from where the skull sloped down towards the snout tip. The back of the skull ended in a hook-like shape, which was offset to the quadrate bone. The orbit (eye opening) was large and circular, and a large spur-like bone, the palpebral, protruded backwards into the upper part of the opening. Below the eye socket, the jugal bone gave rise to a sideways projecting boss, or horn-like structure. The jugal bone also formed a \\"blade\\" that created a slot together with a flange on the pterygoid bone, for guiding the motion of the lower jaw. Ventrally, the antorbital fossa was bounded by a prominent bony ridge, to which the animal's fleshy cheek would have been attached. It has also been suggested that heterodontosaurs and other basal (or \\"primitive\\") orhithischians had lip-like structures like lizards do (based on similarities in their jaws), rather than bridging skin between the upper and lower jaws (such as cheeks). The proportionally large lower temporal fenestra was egg-shaped and tilted back, and located behind the eye opening. The elliptical upper temporal fenestra was visible only looking at the top of the skull. The left and right upper temporal fenestrae were separated by the sagittal crest, which would have provided lateral attachment surfaces for the jaw musculature in the living animal. The lower jaw tapered towards the front, and the dentary bone (the main part of the lower jaw) was robust. The front of the jaws were covered by a toothless keratinous beak (or rhamphotheca). The upper beak covered the front of the premaxilla bone and the lower beak covered the predentary, which are, respectively, the foremost bones of the upper and lower jaw in ornithischians. This is evidenced by the rough surfaces on these structures. The palate was narrow, and tapered towards the front. The external nostril openings were small, and the upper border of this opening does not seem to have been completely bridged by bone. If not due to breakage, the gap may have been formed by connective tissue instead of bone. The antorbital fossa, a large depression between the eye and nostril openings, contained two smaller openings. A depression above the snout has been termed the \\"nasal fossa\\" or \\"sulcus\\". A similar fossa is also seen in Tianyulong, Agilisaurus, and Eoraptor, but its function is unknown. Diagrams showing the dentition of the upper and lower jaw An unusual feature of the skull was the different-shaped teeth (heterodonty) for which the genus is named, which is otherwise mainly known from mammals. Most dinosaurs (and indeed most reptiles) have a single type of tooth in their jaws, but Heterodontosaurus had three. The beaked tip of the snout was toothless, whereas the hind part of the premaxilla in the upper jaw had three teeth on each side. The first two upper teeth were small and cone-shaped (comparable to incisors), while the third on each side was much enlarged, forming prominent, canine-like tusks. These first teeth were probably partially encased by the upper beak. The first two teeth in the lower jaw also formed canines, but were much bigger than the upper equivalents. The canines had fine serrations along the back edge, but only the lower ones were serrated at the front. Eleven tall and chisel-like cheek-teeth lined each side of the posterior parts of the upper jaw, which were separated from the canines by a large diastema (gap). The cheek-teeth increased gradually in size, with the middle teeth being largest, and decreased in size after this point. These teeth had a heavy coat of enamel on the inwards side, and were adapted for wear (hypsodonty), and they had long roots, firmly embedded in their sockets. The tusks in the lower jaw fit into an indentation within the diastema of the upper jaw. The cheek-teeth in the lower jaw generally matched those in the upper jaw, though the enamel surface of these were on the outwards side. The upper and lower teeth rows were inset, which created a \\"cheek-recess\\" also seen in other ornithischians. =Postcranial skeleton= Reconstructed skeleton in Japan The neck consisted of nine cervical vertebrae, which would have formed an S-shaped curve, as indicated by the shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably consisted of 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians. The forelimbs were robustly builtSereno, P.C. (2012). pp. 114‚Äì132. and proportionally long, measuring 70% of the length of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% of the length of the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2. Restoration with integument based on the related genus Tianyulong The hindlimbs were long, slender, and ended in four toes, the first of which (the hallux) did not contact the ground. Uniquely for ornithischians, several bones of the leg and foot were fused: the tibia and fibula were fused with upper tarsal bones (astragalus and calcaneus), forming a tibiotarsus, while the lower tarsal bones were fused with the metatarsal bones, forming a tarsometatarsus. This constellation can also be found in modern birds, where it has evolved independently. The tibiotarsus was about 30% longer than the femur. The ungual bones of the toes were claw-like, and not hoof-like as in more advanced ornithischians. Classification When it was described in 1962, Heterodontosaurus was classified as a primitive member of Ornithischia, one of the two main orders of Dinosauria (the other being Saurischia). The authors found it most similar to the poorly known genera Geranosaurus and Lycorhinus, the second of which had been considered a therapsid stem-mammal until then due to its dentition. They noted some similarities with ornithopods, and provisionally placed the new genus in that group. The palaeontologists Alfred Romer and Oskar Kuhn independently named the family Heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a family of ornithischian dinosaurs including Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus.Sereno, P.C. (2012). pp. 29‚Äì30.Kuhn, O. (1966) Die Reptilien. Verlag Oeben, Krailling near Munich, 154 p. Thulborn instead considered these animals as hypsilophodontids, and not a distinct family. Bakker and Galton recognised Heterodontosaurus as important to the evolution of ornithischian dinosaurs, as its hand pattern was shared with primitive saurischians, and therefore was primitive or basal to both groups. This was disputed by some scientists who believed the two groups had instead evolved independently from \\"thecodontian\\" archosaur ancestors, and that their similarities were due to convergent evolution. Some authors also suggested a relationship, such as descendant/ancestor, between heterodontosaurids and fabrosaurids, both being primitive ornithischians, as well as to primitive ceratopsians, such as Psittacosaurus, though the nature of these relations was debated. By the 1980s, most researchers considered the heterodontosaurids as a distinct family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or as one of the most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2006, palaeontologist Xu Xing and colleagues named the clade Heterodontosauriformes, which included Heterodontosauridae and Marginocephalia, since some features earlier only known from heterodontosaurs were also seen in the basal ceratopsian genus Yinlong. Timelapse video showing the construction of a model built around a skull cast, including musculature Many genera have been referred to Heterodontosauridae since the family was erected, yet Heterodontosaurus remains the most completely known genus, and has functioned as the primary reference point for the group in the palaeontological literature. The cladogram below shows the interrelationships within Heterodontosauridae, and follows the analysis by Sereno, 2012:Sereno, P.C. (2012). pp. 193‚Äì206. Biogeographic distribution of heterodontosaurids in time Heterodontosaurids persisted from the Late Triassic until the Early Cretaceous period, and existed for at least a 100 million years. They are known from Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas, but the majority have been found in southern Africa. Heterodontosaurids appear to have split into two main lineages by the Early Jurassic; one with low-crowned teeth, and one with high-crowned teeth (including Heterodontosaurus). The members of these groups are divided biogeographically, with the low-crowned group having been discovered in areas that were once part of Laurasia (northern landmass), and the high-crowned group from areas that were part of Gondwana (southern landmass). In 2012, Sereno labelled members of the latter grouping a distinct subfamily, Heterodontosaurinae. Heterodontosaurus appears to be the most derived heterodontosaurine, due to details in its teeth, such as very thin enamel, arranged in an asymmetrical pattern. The unique tooth and jaw features of heterodontosaurines appear to be specialisations for effectively processing plant material, and their level of sophistication is comparable to that of later ornithischians. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used by palaeontologist Matthew G. Baron and colleagues to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia. In 2020, palaeontologist Paul-Emile Dieudonn√© and colleagues suggested that members of Heterodontosauridae were basal marginocephalians not forming their own natural group, instead progressively leading to Pachycephalosauria, and were therefore basal members of that group. This hypothesis would reduce the ghost lineage of pachycephalosaurs and pull back the origins of ornithopods back to the Early Jurassic. The subfamily Heterodontosaurinae was considered a valid clade within Pachycephalosauria, containing Heterodontosaurus, Abrictosaurus, and Lycorhinus. Palaeobiology =Diet and tusk function= Evolution of key masticatory specialisations in heterodontosaurids, according to Sereno, 2012 Heterodontosaurus is commonly regarded as a herbivorous dinosaur.Sereno, P.C. (2012). pp. 162‚Äì193. In 1974, Thulborn proposed that the tusks of the dinosaur played no important role in feeding; rather, that they would have been used in combat with conspecifics, for display, as a visual threat, or for active defence. Similar functions are seen in the enlarged tusks of modern muntjacs and chevrotains, but the curved tusks of warthogs (used for digging) are dissimilar. Several more recent studies have raised the possibility that the dinosaur was omnivorous and used its tusks for prey killing during an occasional hunt. In 2000, Paul Barrett suggested that the shape of the premaxillary teeth and the fine serration of the tusks are reminiscent of carnivorous animals, hinting at facultative carnivory. In contrast, the muntjac lacks serration on its tusks. In 2008, Butler and colleagues argued that the enlarged tusks formed early in the development of the individual, and therefore could not constitute sexual dimorphism. Combat with conspecifics thus is an unlikely function, as enlarged tusks would be expected only in males if they were a tool for combat. Instead, feeding or defence functions are more likely. It has also been suggested that Heterodontosaurus could have used its jugal bosses to deliver blows during combat, and that the palpebral bone could have protected the eyes against such attacks. In 2011, Norman and colleagues drew attention to the arms and hands, which are relatively long and equipped with large, recurved claws. These features, in combination with the long hindlimbs that allowed for fast running, would have made the animal capable of seizing small prey. As an omnivore, Heterodontosaurus would have had a significant selection advantage during the dry season when vegetation was scarce. Reconstruction of jaw musculature and keratin sheathing of the beak In 2012, Sereno pointed out several skull and dentition features that suggest a purely or at least preponderantly herbivorous diet. These include the horny beak and the specialised cheek teeth (suitable for cutting off vegetation), as well as fleshy cheeks which would have helped keeping food within the mouth during mastication. The jaw muscles were enlarged, and the jaw joint was set below the level of the teeth. This deep position of the jaw joint would have allowed an evenly spread bite along the tooth row, in contrast to the scissor-like bite seen in carnivorous dinosaurs. Finally, size and position of the tusks are very different in separate members of the Heterodontosauridae; a specific function in feeding thus appears unlikely. Sereno surmised that heterodontosaurids were comparable to today's peccaries, which possess similar tusks and feed on a variety of plant material such as roots, tubers, fruits, seeds and grass. Butler and colleagues suggested that the feeding apparatus of Heterodontosaurus was specialised to process tough plant material, and that late-surviving members of the family (Fruitadens, Tianyulong and Echinodon) probably showed a more generalised diet including both plants and invertebrates. Heterodontosaurus was characterised by a strong bite at small gape angles, but the later members were adapted to a more rapid bite and wider gapes. A 2016 study of ornithischian jaw mechanics found that the relative bite forces of Heterodontosaurus was comparable to that of the more derived Scelidosaurus. The study suggested that the tusks could have played a role in feeding by grazing against the lower beak while cropping vegetation. =Tooth replacement and aestivation= occlusion between an upper and lower cheek tooth in side view Much controversy has surrounded the question of whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of aestivation, when the animal did not feed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce. CT scan video showing replacement teeth and wear facet orientation in AMNH 24000, a partial skull A comprehensive analysis conducted in 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson showed that the wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability in the degree of tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence. In 2006, Butler and colleagues conducted computer tomography scans of the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals ‚Äì this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of the upper and lower jaws. =Locomotion and metabolism= Diagrams showing hand and foot bones of specimen SAM-PK-K1332 Although most researchers now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several features of the forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: These include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able to switch to a much faster, bipedal run. The palaeontologists Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Halszka Osm√≥lska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests. Most studies consider dinosaurs as endothermic (warm-blooded) animals, with an elevated metabolism comparable to that of today's mammals and birds. In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the aerobic endurance of various dinosaurs. Even at moderate running speeds, Heterodontosaurus would have exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities possible for an ectotherm (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus. =Growth and proposed sexual dimorphism= Model, showing hypothetical display structure on the snout, and skull cast The ontogeny, or the development of the individual from juvenile to adult, is poorly known for Heterodontosaurus, as juvenile specimens are scarce. As shown by the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487, the eye sockets became proportionally smaller as the animal grew, and the snout became longer and contained additional teeth. Similar changes have been reported for several other dinosaurs. The morphology of the teeth, however, did not change with age, indicating that the diet of juveniles was the same as that of adults. The length of the juvenile skull was suggested to be . Assuming similar body proportions as adult individuals, the body length of this juvenile would have been . Indeed, the individual probably would have been smaller, since juvenile animals in general show proportionally larger heads. In 1974, Thulborn suggested that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a secondary sex characteristic. According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype specimen of the related Abrictosaurus, which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, who argued that the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype specimen of Abrictosaurus; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus. Palaeoenvironment Heterodontosaurus is known from fossils found in formations of the Karoo Supergroup, including the Upper Elliot Formation and the Clarens Formation, which date to the Hettangian and Sinemurian ages of the Lower Jurassic, around 200‚Äì190 million years ago. Originally, Heterodontosaurus was thought to be from the Upper Triassic period. The Upper Elliot Formation consists of red/purple mudstone and red/white sandstone, whereas the slightly younger Clarens Formation consists of white/cream- coloured sandstone. The Clarens Formation is less rich in fossils than the Upper Elliot Formation; its sediments also often form cliffs, restricting accessibility for fossil hunters. The Upper Elliot Formation is characterised by animals that appear to be more lightly built than those of the Lower Elliot Formation, which may have been an adaptation to the drier climate at this time in southern Africa. Both formations are famous for their abundant vertebrate fossils, including temnospondyl amphibians, turtles, lepidosaurs, aetosaurs, crocodylomorphs, and non-mammal cynodonts. Other dinosaurs from these formations include the genasaur Lesothosaurus, the basal sauropodomorph Massospondylus, and the theropod Megapnosaurus. The Lower Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides Heterodontosaurus, it contained Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, and Pegomastax. Yet another member of the family, Geranosaurus, is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species might have fed on separate food sources in order to avoid competition (niche partitioning). With its highly specialised dentition, Heterodontosaurus might have been specialised for tough plant material, while the less specialised Abrictosaurus might have predominantly consumed softer vegetation. The position of the individual heterodontosaurid specimens within the rock succession is poorly known, making it difficult to determine how many of these species really were conspecific, and which species existed at separate times.

The dead rubber match therefore has no effect on the winner and loser of the series, other than the total number of matches won and lost. The term is used in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis, as well as in international cricket, field hockey, the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League and Rugby World Cup. For example, in a Davis Cup series, each pair of competing countries play five matches (rubbers) where the winner is decided on a best-of-five basis. Once one team has reached three victories, the remaining match or matches are said to be dead rubbers. International Tennis Federation's last revision of the competition policies on dead rubbers is from 2011. Since the result of a dead rubber has no impact in determining the winner of a series, dead rubbers are typically played in a less intense atmosphere, often allowing the team that has lost the series to obtain a match win. Sometimes, second-string players who have not played many matches in top-level competition are given the opportunity to play a dead rubber in order to gain experience. This practice makes completing a clean sweep of a series less likely.

It was originally dated to approximately 210 million years ago during the Late Triassic (late Norian to Rhaetian stages), which would make it one of the oldest known sauropods. Its age was later considered uncertain, and may be as young as Late Jurassic. The only species is Isanosaurus attavipachi. Though important for the understanding of sauropod origin and early evolution, Isanosaurus is poorly known. Exact relationships to other early sauropods remain unresolved.  Description  Models in Poland The only specimen includes a neck vertebra, a back vertebra and part of a second, six tail vertebra, two chevrons, fragmentary ribs, the right sternal plate, the right shoulder blade, and the left thigh bone (femur). This individual may have measured when alive; the thigh bone measures 76 centimetres in length. However, the vertebral neural arches have been found separated from the vertebral centra, indicating that these elements were not fused with each other; thus, this individual probably was not fully grown. Early sauropodomorphs were primitively bipedal (two-legged). Isanosaurus, being one of the first sauropods known, already shows a quadrupedal locomotion (with all four legs on the ground). The legs were column-like, as indicated by the robust and straight thigh bone. In prosauropods, but also in the very basal sauropod Antetonitrus, the thigh bone was slightly sigmoidal (S-curved). Also, like in other sauropods, bony processes of the femur were reduced in Isanosaurus; most notably, the lesser trochanter was lacking. Additional important features can be found in the vertebrae. The neck vertebrae were distinctly opisthocoelous (convex at the front and hollow at the back), forming ball-and-socket joints with neighbouring vertebrae. The tail vertebrae, on the other hand, were amphicoelous (concave at both ends). The dorsal neural spines were very high, like those of some later sauropods, unlike the low prosauropod neural spines. The lateral sides of the vertebrae were concave, but not deeply excavated (a structure known as pleurocoels) as in later sauropods.  Discovery  The specimen was found in dark red sandstone of the Nam Phong Formation near the village of Ban Non Thaworn, in Chaiyaphum Province. When discovered in 1998, the skeleton had unfortunately been mostly eroded away. With regard to vertebrate fossils, the Nam Phong Formation is poorly explored: besides Isanosaurus, only two articulated ischia were found. Whether these ischia belong to Isanosaurus is unclear, because no pelvic bones are preserved in the holotype specimen. Isanosaurus was described by French palaeontologist √âric Buffetaut and colleagues in 2000. The name is derived from Isan (north-eastern Thailand); the species name honours P. Attavipach, a supporter of palaeontological research in Thailand and former Director General of the Thai Department of Mineral Resources.  References  Peyre de Fabr√®gues, C. & Allain, R. 2020.

The 940 was based on the SDS 930's 24-bit CPU, with additional circuitry to provide protected memory and virtual memory. It was announced in February 1966 and shipped in April, becoming a major part of Tymshare's expansion during the 1960s. The influential Stanford Research Institute \\"oN-Line System\\" (NLS) was demonstrated on the system. This machine was later used to run Community Memory, the first bulletin board system. After SDS was acquired by Xerox in 1969 and became Xerox Data Systems, the SDS 940 was renamed as the XDS 940. History The design was originally created by the University of California, Berkeley as part of their Project Genie that ran between 1964 and 1965. Genie added memory management and controller logic to an existing SDS 930 computer to give it page-mapped virtual memory, which would be heavily copied by other designs. The 940 was simply a commercialized version of the Genie design and remained backwardly compatible with their earlier models, with the exception of the 12-bit SDS 92. Like most systems of the era, the machine was built with a bank of core memory as the primary storage, allowing between 16 and 64 kilowords. Words were 24 bits plus a parity bit. This was backed up by a variety of secondary storage devices, including a 1376 kword drum in Genie, or hard disks in the SDS models in the form of a drum-like 2097 kword \\"fixed-head\\" disk or a traditional \\"floating- head\\" model. The SDS machines also included a paper tape punch and reader, line printer, and a real-time clock. They bootstrapped from paper tape. A file storage of 96 MB were also attached. The line printer used was a Potter Model HSP-3502 chain printer with 96 printing characters and a speed of about 230 lines per minute. Software system The operating system developed at Project Genie was the Berkeley Timesharing System. By August 1968 a version 2.0 was announced that was just called the \\"SDS 940 Time-Sharing System\\". As of 1969, the XDS 940 software system consisted of the following: * Time- Sharing Monitor (what is now usually called a kernel) * Time-Sharing Executive (what is now usually called a command-line interface) * CAL, the Conversational Algebraic LanguageButler Lampson (but without attribution), CAL Reference Manual for SDS 940 Time-Sharing Computer System, Scientific Data Systems, June 1967. * QED, a text editor(without attribution), QED Reference Manual for SDS 940 Time-Sharing Computer Systems, Preliminary Edition, Scientific Data Systems, Jan. 1969. * Fortran IV * BASIC The minimal configuration required to run the Software System included (partial list): * Two 16-kword core-memory modules (with multiple access). * Two rapid-access disc (RAD) storage units and couplers (just under 4M character capacity each); optionally two more could be connected * Disc file and coupler, with 67M characters of storage * Magnetic tape control unit and two magnetic-tape transports (controller supports up to 8) * Asynchronous communication controller(s), supporting up to 64 teletypewriter lines each Additional software was available from the XDS Users' Group Library, such as a string- processing system, \\"SYSPOPs\\" (system programmed operators, which allow access to system services), CAL (Conversational Algebraic Language, a dialect of JOSS), QED (a text editor), TAP (Time-sharing Assembly Program, an assembler), and DDT, a debugging tool. A cathode ray tube display with 26 lines that operated DDT loader-debugger that were originally designed to operate from a teletype terminal were also available. Notable installations Butler Lampson estimated that about 60 of the machines were sold. The major customer was Tymshare, who used the system to become the USA's best known commercial timesharing service in the late 1960s. By 1972 Tymshare alone had 23 systems in operation. (includes pictures) Comshare, Inc, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, was the second most important corporate customer; Tymshare, Comshare and UC Berkeley collaborated in much of the operating system development for the SDS 940. Douglas Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center (ARC) used an SDS 940 for their oN-Line System, more commonly known as NLS. It was with this computer that he gave The Mother of All Demos in December 1968, heralding many of the concepts associated with personal computing today. The first host connected to the ARPANET was an SDS 940 at SRI in October, 1969.

It is thick and comes in sheets . The Homasote Company operates a factory in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey. History The Agasote Millboard Company was founded as a division of the Bermuda Trading Company in 1909 by Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge. Outerbridge brought the process to the US from England. The first commercial use of the panels were for lining railroad cars. In 1915, the company won a contract to use the panels as automobile tops. From 1915 to 1925 they supplied board for the tops of Ford Motor Company, Buick, Nash Motors, Studebaker, and Dodge. They also manufactured a larger panel, sold as \\"vehisote\\" for truck panels. The panels were used for the exterior of field hospitals and military housing in France during WWI. By 1925 car manufacturers switched to canvas tops and Agasote lost sales, so the company heavily promoted Homasote for its versatility and insulation properties. The company then changed its name to Homasote after its now largest product. The company makes a version called \\"440 SoundBarrier\\". Model railroading Homasote is frequently used by model railroading for the sub-roadbed or roadbed,Larson, Russ. N Scale Primer. Kalmback Publishing Company, 1974, p. 20. because of its noise-deadening qualities, ease of forming into shapes used as roadbed for tracks, ease of driving nails to hold track sections to the bed, light weight and retention of form under plaster scenery. Cork, plywood, hardboard, drywall, and foam insulation are common alternatives to Homasote.  Other uses  Homasote was widely used as wall sheeting from the 1940s into the 1970s. Due to the development of more fire-resistant gypsum board it has decreased in popularity as a wall sheeting. Homasote is found in studio spaces and featured in many art institutions as a wall covering and doubling as a type of cork board. It often receives hundreds of coats of paint over the years due to the product's strength. Homasote is used for blocking knit or crochet pieces. \\"Homosote is sturdy, and incredibly absorbent. It will wick water away from your garment so it dries more quickly. And it's like a bulletin board -- you can stick pins in it easily.\\"http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter02/FEATdiyknitter.html At Northwest Folklife the dance floor in the Fisher Pavilion is built each year from two layers of Homasote overlaid with a layer of painted Masonite. The Homasote base reduces the incidence of impact injuries such as shin splints caused by dancing on the concrete floor.

The case settled the issue of when a physician may be sued for battery and when it is more appropriate to sue the doctor in negligence. The Court wrote unanimously that \\"unless there has been misrepresentation or fraud to secure consent to the treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant risks, however serious, should go to negligence rather than to battery.\\" The case also marked the creation of a standard whereby a physician must give the patient sufficient information so that an objective, reasonable person in the patient's position would be able to make an informed choice about a medical procedure.

Reibl was eighteen months away from obtaining a lifetime pension, and the stroke prevented him from earning that pension. He stated that if he had been aware of the risks in the surgery, he would have waited the year and a half to earn his pension before undergoing the procedure, even if it meant a shortened life. In the original trial, Reibl was awarded monetary damages for negligence and battery, irrespective of his having signed a formal consent form. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the court directed that a new trial be held, but that the charge of battery be disallowed from the new proceedings. Ruling It is a general principle in tort law that a defendant is not liable for damages unless their negligence was the cause of the injury to the plaintiff. In the context of a medical malpractice claim where it is alleged the doctor failed to inform the patient of a risk, the doctor will not be held liable if the patient would have had the procedure anyway (even if they knew of the risk). Reibl v. Hughes the Supreme Court outlined a \\"modified objective test\\" for causation in medical malpractice. It is well established in Canadian law that a doctor cannot be sued for not disclosing information if the patient would have consented to the operation irrespective of whether or not the information was disclosed. Consider this example: your doctor knows that a surgery has a 5% chance of causing complete paralysis but does not tell you. Without the operation, however, you will very likely die within 12 months. The court looked at two approaches: an objective test (\\"what would a reasonable person do?\\") and a subjective (\\"what would this plaintiff have done?\\"). There was concern that an objective test favors the doctor while a subjective test favors the plaintiff. In an objective test, the Court would accept medical evidence that the chance of paralysis was 5% and the chance of death was high. A reasonable person, thinking rationally, would take the risk of paralysis over death. If it were a subjective test, the Court would ask the plaintiff. Logically, the plaintiff, who is paralysed will say \\"no.\\" Logically, if the plaintiff said they would have had the operation anyway, they would not be suing the doctor. In Reibl, The Court created a \\"modified objective test\\" which starts with the \\"reasonable person\\" and adds some of the characteristics of the plaintiff, such as age, sex, and family circumstances but will not allow \\"irrational beliefs\\" to be taken into account. The test has been frequently used to determine many medical malpractice and negligence cases, including Arndt v. Smith.Arndt v.

Jones played 19 Tests from 1894 to 1902 and represented Port Adelaide, North Adelaide and South Adelaide Football Clubs.Krueger, p. 4. Nicknamed Jonah, Jones was one of the best and fastest bowlers of his time, initially erratic but subsequently gaining control of line and length to good effect. Jones worked as a customs officer, and one of his claims to fame as a cricketer was that he was known as 'The man who bowled a ball through W. G. Grace's Beard' and was reputed to have broken Stanley Jackson's ribs. His action was controversial and complained about in both England (in 1896) and Australia. Umpire Jim Phillips was given the job of enforcing the laws against illegal actions which had once more crept into the game in the late 1890s. Jones was first no-balled in a match between South Australia and the visiting English side in 1897/98. Phillips again no-balled him once in the 2nd Test of that series, Jones thus becoming the first bowler to be called for throwing in a Test match.

Australian football career Reedman began to make his mark as an Australian rules footballer in 1884, whilst playing parklands football for Medindie. He went on to join Hotham who were in the Adelaide Suburban Association (ASA) competition, and was a key member of the club's 1885 premiership side. He captained Hotham when they again won the ASA title in 1886. Hotham joined the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) in 1887, with Reedman as captain. Just prior to the 1888 football season, Hotham changed their name to North Adelaide (no connection to the current club) and again Reedman was captain. When North Adelaide amalgamated with the Adelaide club in 1889, Reedman moved to South Adelaide, where he was appointed captain, a position he held until 1898, playing 172 consecutive matches (bringing his total to 200) and leading South to five premierships in seven years before the introduction of electorate football (whereby footballers had to play for their local team) forced his move to North Adelaide in 1899. Reedman led North Adelaide from 1901‚Äì1905, and in that time the club won premierships in 1902 and 1905, with Reedman also being part of the 1900 premiership team. He also captained South Australia in 1903. Following his retirement from playing, Reedman was appointed coach of the lowly West Adelaide Football Club in 1908. To the end of 1907, West Adelaide had won only 23 and drawn 1 of the 145 SAFA matches they had played, and had been perennially close to or on the bottom of the ladder. Reedman coached West Adelaide to its first ever premiership in 1908, and then defeated Victorian Football League (VFL) champions Carlton Football Club to become Champions of Australia. Reedman promptly left West Adelaide to return to North Adelaide for one last season as a player, but it was an inauspicious finale, as the red and whites finished second last. Reedman played 115 matches for North Adelaide, bringing his career total of matches to 319. He retired at the age of 43. His 319 career matches remained a record in South Australian football until 1970, when it was broken by Lindsay Head. His record of 200 consecutive matches was a record in elite football until it was broken by Jack Titus in 1943. Cricket career Reedman made his first-class cricket debut for South Australia on 17 February 1888 against Victoria at the Adelaide Oval. An all-rounder, Reedman made a duck in his only innings of the match and did not bowl as South Australia won by an innings and 113 runs. Despite this inauspicious start, Reedman went on to captain South Australia and represent Australia in one Test match against England, at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) during the 1894/95 Ashes series. Reedman made 17 and four and produced bowling figures of 1/12 and 0/12. In addition to his football and cricket exploits, Reedman was also a leading long distance swimmer of the period. Honours Reedman has been selected as a back pocket and change ruckman in South Adelaide's official ‚ÄòGreatest Team‚Äô. In 1996, he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame and in 2002, he was inducted into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame. Reedman's brother Sid also captained South Adelaide.

In the summer of 1970, the National Geographic Society and the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History organized a joint paleontological expedition, led by geologist William J. Morris, to the Arroyo del Rosario in Baja California. While prospecting, volunteer Harley James Garbani discovered the skeleton of a theropod north of Punta Baja near Cerro Rayado. Garbani excavated the site in 1970 and 1971. The type species, Labocania anomala, was described and named by Ralph Molnar in 1974. The generic name references the La Bocana Roja Formation, named after la Bocana Roja, \\"the red estuary\\". The specific name means \\"anomalous\\" in Latin, in reference to the distinctive build. The holotype, LACM 20877, was found in a layer of the La Bocana Roja Formation, dating from the late Campanian, about 73 million years old. It consists of a very fragmentary skeleton with skull elements, including a right quadrate, a left frontal, a piece of the left maxilla, a fragment of the dentarium, a chevron, the upper parts of both ischia, the middle shaft of the right pubis, most of the second right metatarsal, a pedal phalanx and several loose teeth. The elements were not articulated, dispersed over a surface of about two square metres, and strongly weathered. The remains were mixed with the ribs of Hadrosauroidea. Though its exact size is hard to establish, Labocania was probably a medium-sized carnivore, about long. Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 7 meters (23 ft), its weight at 1.5 tonnes (1.65 short tons) in 2010. In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 8.2 meters (27 ft) and 2.6 tonnes (2.86 short tons). The cranial elements are very robust, and the frontals in particular are strongly thickened. The teeth of the maxilla are gradually recurving and rather flat; those of the premaxilla do not have a D-shaped cross-section. Because Labocania is based on fragmentary material, its affinities are uncertain. Molnar noted certain similarities between Labocania and tyrannosaurids, especially in the form of the ischium which features a low triangular obturator process and a circular lateral scar on the upper end, but he did not assign Labocania to any family, placing it as theropoda incertae sedis. Molnar especially compared Labocania with Indosaurus and \\"Chilantaisaurus\\" maortuensis, later made the separate genus Shaochilong. Labocania was considered as a possible tyrannosauroid in the 2004 review of the group by Thomas R.

It is generally thought to be closely related to dinosaurs, as a member of the Dinosauromorpha. Its fossils were found in the Cha√±ares Formation of Argentina, the dating of which is uncertain; some sources date it to the Middle Triassic whilst others date it to the earliest Carnian.  History  The type species Lagosuchus talampayensis was first described by Alfred S. Romer in 1971, who considered it a \\"pseudosuchian\\" (then a collection of various non-dinosaurian \\"thecodonts\\"). In 1972 he named a second species, Lagosuchus lilloensis, known from a larger and more well- preserved skeleton. A later review by Jose Bonaparte in 1975 synonymized the two species and considered Lagosuchus intermediate between \\"pseudosuchians\\" and saurischian dinosaurs. Modern authors now consider at least L. lilloensis to be firmly on the lineage of archosaurs leading to dinosaurs. However, the genus Lagosuchus is regarded by some to be dubious. Paul Sereno and Andrea Arcucci considered L. talampayensis to be undiagnosable in a 1994 study, and reclassified L. lilloensis as a new genus, Marasuchus. In 2019, the holotype skeleton of L. talampayensis was redescribed by Federico Agnolin and Martin Ezcurra who determined it to not only be diagnostic, but indistinguishable from specimens of Marasuchus lilloensis, and so supported the synonymy proposed by Bonaparte. Additionally, the dating of its formation is unclear; recent research has dated the Cha√±ares to the early Carnian stage of the Late Triassic. Description Artist's impressions and skeletal restoration Lagosuchus is known from very incomplete remains (only a hind leg plus a shoulder blade and vertebrae can be definitely assigned to it). However, features of the leg show that it was a lightly built archosaur, and is notable for its long slender legs and well-developed feet - features it shares with certain dinosaurs. These features, as well as comparisons to close relatives, suggest that it could run on its hind legs for short periods, although it probably moved on all fours most of the time. Lagosuchus was likely an agile predator that could use speed to chase its prey and to escape larger predators. Lagosuchus was about the size of a ferret. Palaeobiology =Metabolism= It is believed that Lagosuchus and Marasuchus were transitional between cold blooded reptiles and warm blooded dinosaurs.

The monastery was established in the late 11th century by the donation of land by three Counts to the Benedictine Order. It enjoyed considerable freedoms for an ecclesiastical property at that time, but would in the 13th century become a de facto possession of the Dukes of Teck and then the County of W√ºrttemberg. In the 15th century, the monastery enjoyed economic prosperity and it physically expanded. In the 16th century, however, it was dissolved with the conversion of the by-then Duchy of W√ºrttemberg to Lutheranism. The monastery became a seminary and boarding school until the 17th century and was physically reduced over the 19th century by land sales and demolition. History Early in 1095, three noblemen ‚Äì Adalbert, Count of Zollern, Alwik, , and Ruotmann von Neckarhausen ‚Äì donated about of property to the Order of Saint Benedict. The site was forested and mountainous, and remote, only accessible from nearby towns by the Kinzig and Kleine Kinzig rivers. This isolated locale, Alpirsbach, was inspired by the Hirsau Reform, which sought to free the Church from the control of the nobility. The monastery's founders, its first abbot, Uto, who had expanded the monasteries at Wiblingen, Ochsenhausen, and G√∂ttweig, and the Bishop of Constance, Gebhard (III) of Constance, all supported Pope Gregory VII against Emperor Henry IV in the Investiture Controversy. The monastery was settled by monks from Sankt Blasien Abbey in the Black Forest, another reform monastery, and its church was consecrated in 1099 by Bishop Gebhard. The abbey received Papal protection in 1101, and in 1123 Emperor Henry V confirmed its right to choose its own abbot and vogt. They chose the Count of Zollern and, in spite of Papal and Imperial guarantees, the title of vogt would become hereditary. It passed from the Counts of Zollern to the Dukes of Teck, who held it in the 13th and 14th centuries, and then finally to the Counts of W√ºrttemberg. The founders also endowed Alpirsbach Abbey with a number of ' in villages in the Baar, along the Neckar. Count Adalbert joined the monastery around 1100 and donated more property to it in the wine-growing Breisgau region. The protection of the County and later Duchy of W√ºrttemberg allowed the monastery to prosper. It entered an economic boom in the 15th century, a period marked by monastic reform that Alpirsbach's monks, who were mostly local nobility, tried to resist. In 1479, Hieronymous Hulzing was elected as abbot of Alpirsbach and began a series of construction projects, but also joined the Bursfelde Congregation, a coalition of reformist Benedictine monasteries. =Early modern period= In 1522, Alpirsbach's prior, a monk named Ambrosius Blarer, left the monastery for his native Constance after being stripped of his position. Blarer, who had been giving Lutheran sermons at the monastery and had met and befriended the Lutheran reformer Philip Melanchthon during his studies, returned to W√ºrttemberg in 1534 to become one of Duke Ulrich's chief reformers. The other reformer Ulrich brought to W√ºrttemberg was the Erhard Schnepf, a student of Zwingli with whom Blarer worked to reform the Duchy. Blarer governed the highlands of the Duchy that included Alpirsbach, but was replaced in all his offices by Schnepf in 1538. The Protestant Reformation was imposed on Alpirsbach in 1535 and its administrative apparatus dissolved into a new district of Alpirsbach. Until the monastery's final dissolution in 1806, its abbot would be a Protestant clergyman. In 1556, Duke Christoph dissolved Alpirsbach and the other 12 remaining monasteries in W√ºrttemberg. Their grounds were reused for Protestant seminaries and boarding schools. The Alpirsbach seminary lasted from 1556 to 1595 and taught around 200 students. When the primary school at Alpirsbach closed, it left the schools at Blaubeuren and monasteries as the only primary schools in the Duchy. =Modern period= Alpirsbach Abbey from the north, 1881 In the 19th century, much of the monastery's grounds were sold and the buildings on those lands demolished. Construction of a railroad between 1882 and 1886, and a road south of the monastery, resulted in the loss of its medieval defenses. The cloister began to be used as a music venue for classical music in 1952. In 1958, a collection of 15th and 16th century clothes, papers, and material refuse was found in the walls of the cloister. Among the items was a pair of men's pants, 17 leather shoes, and shirts consistent with the attire of the seminary students. These items are now housed in the monastery museum. In 1999, Alpirsbach Monastery was added to the Northern Black Forest Monastery Route. Alpirsbach Monastery was closed on 17 March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and was reopened on 12 May 2020. Renovations on the abbey square from March to August 2020, which moved its entrance, caused much confusion for returning visitors. Between 15 May 2019 and 10 December 2020, two pieces of medieval artwork were moved from the Stadtkirche in Freudenstadt to Alpirsbach Abbey and displayed there while the former was undergoing renovations. Architecture Alpirbach Abbey's plan was informed by Benedictine custom and follows after the plans of the abbeys of Cluny and Hirsau. Much of the monastery was constructed between 1125 and 1133 in the Romanesque style, with additions made between 1480 and 1494 in the Gothic style. The cloister is attached to the south side of the abbey church and is lined with the monks' living spaces. To the southeast of the abbey were offices, barns, an infirmary, and a bathhouse. No major alterations or additions were made to the monastery during the period of the Renaissance, though Renaissance-influenced murals are present in the dormitories. Following the demolitions of the 19th century, the only surviving portion of the monastery's defenses is the vogts tower house. =Abbey church= Tympanum above the door into the abbey church The abbey church is a three-aisled, Romanesque basilica on a cruciform plan, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, and consecrated in May 1128 by Bishop . It is entered from the narthex, which is called \\"the Paradise\\" and once contained a small chapel, at the west end. The tympanum above the narthex entrance, carved around 1150, shows Jesus Christ at its center, seated on a throne and wreathed in a mandorla and flanked by two angels. Two kneeling humans appear at the ends of the image; Adalbert von Zollern is the male figure. Above Christ is a carved inscription, in Latin, of . Inside the church, the bases and capitals of its columns are images of the Last Judgment. During its monastic existence, the abbey church was richly decorated with wall hangings, frescoes, furniture, and icons. Of this inventory, only some 13th century frescoes of the Crucifixion and the Last Judgement in the choir niches, stained glass, some choir pews, and the Late Gothic altar remain. The rood screen that divided the choir monks from the lay brothers has also been removed. From 1878 to 1891, the interior of the abbey church was repainted with stenciled imitation medieval designs. These were removed during a restoration of the church to a more accurate approximation of its original appearance in the 1960s. Along the south side of the nave is an open gallery stretching over the north side of the cloister created in the last years of the 15th century. Altar of St. Mary The choir stalls, reduced in number and size since the Middle Ages, are presently on the second floor of the cloister's south wing. They have two rows, though 19th century photographs taken when the stalls were still in the abbey church show three. Paint is still present on the ornamental canopies of the back row, and the cheeks at either end of the stalls have carved images of Saints Vitus and Jerome. A signature on the stalls states that they were completed by an \\"H.M.\\", likely a Swabian master craftsman, on St. Martin's Day, 1493. On display in the northern transept is the Altar of St. Mary, originally one of eight altars in the abbey church. The altar is a Late Gothic winged altar that was produced between 1520 and 1525 by the Ulm workshop of the Swabian master woodcarver Niklaus Weckmann. When opened, it displays the life of Mary through the paintings of the Annunciation on the left and the Visitation on the right, and the Coronation of the Virgin in the central carved image. No paint is applied to the carved image except for flesh tones. When closed, two images from the Passion of Jesus, the Flagellation and the Crowning with Thorns, are displayed. The paintings were made in brown with white highlighting, which is unusual for the inside images. Their author is unknown, but Weckmann historically worked with some of Ulm's most famous artisans. Attached to the north side of the facade, flanking the choir, is the bell tower, tall. The tower, stylistically similar to those of abbeys in Lorraine, originally stood at parity with the roof of the abbey church. In the mid-12th century, shortly after the completion of the church, another story was added to the tower, built of ornamental ashlar that also corresponds to Upper Rhenish Romanesque masonry. Another two stories, and a buttress at the base of the tower, were added in the 15th century, but were plain in make so as to not contrast with the rest of the tower. The Gothic belfry has been dated to around 1360, meaning bells were hung in the tower from at least that date. The final story was added in the 1550s and clad in the Renaissance style with a stepped gable roof. =Cloister and conclave= South end of the dormitory Attached to the south side of the abbey church is an ensemble of buildings that the monks lived and worked in. This ensemble is constituted by the cloister, and the western, southern, and eastern wings. The cloister was rebuilt by Abbot Hulzing from 1480 in the Gothic style, which replaced all of the original Romanesque, except for a section of the east wing. The Gothic rib vaulting is ornate, featuring several carved images, and was once painted. This remodeling also added a second floor above the cloister that connected the abbey church and the east and south wings, but not the west wing. The west wing is where the entrance into the cloister is found and the residence of the abbot, on the second floor. The abbot's suite was made up by a reception room, an office, and living room. Today it contains an exhibit of the Monastery Museum. Also in the west wing is access to an cellarium, where foodstuffs were kept, but as of 2020 houses the information center. The south wing contains the refectory, calefactory, and kitchen. The east wing was where the monks resided and contained, on its ground floor, the workshops, common room, and the , and the dormitory on the second floor. The dormitory was originally a large, open room that in the late 15th century was subdivided into cells with half-timber walls that were painted with faux brickwork and, later, graffiti by seminary students. The second floor of the cloister allowed the addition of another row of cells, entered via a short staircase to account for the difference in height. There is an entryway from the dormitory into the abbey church. =Museum= The Monastery Museum displays items from the monastery's thousand-year existence. Much of its collection comes from the 1958 find of apparel, letters and ledgers of paper or parchment, tiles, bricks, and gaming paraphernalia. These items are on display in the \\"Monks and Scholars\\" exhibition, located in the abbot's residence. Of particular note are a pair of pants made of linen and prominently featuring a codpiece that has been dated to between 1500 and 1520. They are one of the only surviving pieces of common attire from the 16th century.

Auriol began competing in motocross and enduro events in 1973. From 1979 to 1994, he took part in The Paris-Dakar rally, taking part in the first nine events on a bike and the remaining seven on a car. On a bike, he won the event in 1981 and 1983 on a BMW R80G/S entered by BMW France, finishing in second in 1984. He broke both ankles on the penultimate day of the 1987 edition, while he was in the lead. He wrote a book with the French journalist Jean-Michel Caradec'h, \\"Paris Dakar. Une histoire d'hommes\\" about this story. Then Auriol switched to the car class in 1988, first racing a works Mitsubishi Pajero Proto T3, but after losing the event to Ari Vatanen in 1990, switched to the Citro√´n team, winning in 1992 with a ZX Rallye Raid, co-driven by Philippe Monnet. In 1994, Auriol joined Dakar organizer ASO and became race director of the event he won for three times, starting in the 1995 edition. He headed the event until the 2004 edition, when he was replaced by Patrick Zaniroli. In 2008 he founded the Africa Eco Race. Hubert Auriol lives in Suresnes with his wife and three children.

It is related to the phenomena of featuritis and scope creep in the manufacture of various consumer goods, and of mission creep in military planning. mechanical ratchet moving in its \\"forward\\" direction and unable to move backward. In sociology, \\"ratchet effects refer to the tendency for central controllers to base next year's targets on last year's performance, meaning that managers who expect still to be in place in the next target period have a perverse incentive not to exceed targets even if they could easily do\\" (Bevan and Hood 2006, p. 521). Examples =Famine cycle= Garrett Hardin, a biologist and environmentalist, used the phrase to describe how food aid keeps people alive who would otherwise die in a famine. They live and multiply in better times, making another bigger crisis inevitable, since the supply of food has not been increased.Malthus, T. (1798). An Essay on the Principle of Population. London: Printed for J. Johnson, in St. Paul's Church-Yard. The ratchet effect first came to light in Alan Peacock and Jack Wiseman's work: The Growth of Public Expenditure in the United Kingdom. Peacock and Wiseman found that public spending increases like a ratchet following periods of crisis.Alan Peacock and Jack Wiseman , 1961, The term was later used by American historian, Robert Higgs to highlight Peacock and Wiseman's research in his book, \\"Crisis and Leviathan\\".Robert Higgs Crisis and Leviathan, OUP, 1987, Similarly, governments have difficulty in rolling back huge bureaucratic organizations created initially for temporary needs, e.g., at times of war, natural or economic crisis. The effect may likewise afflict large business corporations with myriad layers of bureaucracy which resist reform or dismantling. =Production strategy= Jean Tirole used the concept in his pioneering work on regulation and monopolies. The ratchet effect can denote an economic strategy arising in an environment where incentive depends on both current and past production, such as in a competitive industry employing piece rates. The producers observe that since incentive is readjusted based on their production, any increase in production confers only a temporary increase in incentive while requiring a permanently greater expenditure of work. They therefore decide not to reveal hidden production capacity unless forced to do so. =Game theory= The ratchet effect is central to the mathematical Parrondo's paradox. =Cultural anthropology= In 1999 comparative psychologist Michael Tomasello used the ratchet effect metaphor to shed light on the evolution of culture.Tomasello, M. 1999. The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. He explains that the sharedness of human culture means that it is cumulative in character. Once a certain invention has been made, it can jump from one mind to another (by means of imitation) and thus a whole population can acquire a new trait (and so the ratchet has gone \\"up\\" one tooth). Comparative psychologist Claudio Tennie, Tomasello, and Josep Call call this the \\"cultural ratchet\\" and they describe it as being unique to human culture. =Developmental biology= Receptors which initiate cell fate transduction cascades, in early embryo development, exhibit a ratchet effect in response to morphogen concentrations. The low receptor occupancy permits increases in receptor occupancy which alter the cell fate, but the high receptor affinity does not allow ligand dissociation leading to a cell fate of a lower concentration. = Technology regulation = The ratchet effect is reflected in the Collingridge dilemma. Application in economics =Consumer products= The ratchet effect can be seen in long-term trends in the production of many consumer goods. Year by year, automobiles gradually acquire more features. Competitive pressures make it hard for manufacturers to cut back on the features unless forced by a true scarcity of raw materials (e.g., an oil shortage that drives costs up radically). University textbook publishers gradually get \\"stuck\\" in producing books that have excess content and features. In software development, products which compete often will use specification lists of competitive products to add features, presuming that they must provide all of the features of the competitive product, plus add additional functionality. This can lead to \\"feature creep\\" in which it is considered necessary to add all of a competitor's features whether or not customers will use them. Airlines initiate frequent-flyer programs that become ever harder to terminate. Successive generations of home appliances gradually acquire more features; new editions of software acquire more features; and so on. With all of these goods, there is ongoing debate as to whether the added features truly improve usability, or simply increase the tendency for people to buy the goods. =Trade legislation= The term was included by the MAI Negotiating Group in the 1990s as the essence of a device to enforce legislative progress toward \\"free trade\\" by preventing legislative rollback with the compulsory assent of governments as a condition of participation. > Rollback is the liberalisation process by which the reduction and eventual > elimination of nonconforming measures to the MAI would take place.

He was revered as a saint while he was still alive. The legend surrounding him tells of wild animals that freely came up to him and birds that landed in his hands. His followers founded many churches in his honor, including the famous Rila Monastery. One of these churches, \\"St Ivan Rilski\\" was only discovered in 2008 in the town of Veliko Tarnovo. Today, he is honored as the patron saint of the Bulgarians and as one of the most important saints in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The tomb of John of Rila near Rila Monastery  Life  The Cave of John of Rila near the Rila Monastery Saint Ivan of Rila was born app. 876 a.c. in Skrino, at the foot of the Osogovo mountain (close to the modern city of Dupnitsa). He was a contemporary of the reign of emperor and saint Boris I, his sons Vladimir (Rassate) and tsar Simeon I The Great, and the son of the latter - Saint tsar Peter I. Originally a herder, at the age of 25, Saint Ivan of Rila became a priest in the \\"St. Dimitrii\\" monastery located under peak Ruen. After accepting the life of a monk, he left the monastery in order to continue his life in solitude and prayer. Saint Ivan of Rila lived in isolation in various locations before going to the Rila Mountains. There he spent the rest of his life in prayer and deprived himself of an everyday life by settling in the uncomfortable conditions of the caves in the Rila mountains. According to legend, Saint Ivan of Rila was known to have performed a multitude of miracles in order to help the people. These miracles brought him undesired fame as he tried to live the life of a hermit and avoid contact with others. With his growing number of followers, many young believers and supporters set up camps around his cave, seeking a blessing from him. This led the way to the creation of the Rila Monastery, which is considered to be the foremost monastery in Bulgaria. Word of the miracles he performed reached the capital of the Bulgarian Empire - Great Preslav. Tsar Peter I (son of tsar Simeon I) took a 450 km trip to the Rila Mountains in order to meet St. Ivan and seek spiritual advice. Their meeting is described in detail in one the hagiologies of St. Ivan Rilski as well as in the Testament of St. Ivan of Rila itself. After a long and exhausting trip, tsar Peter I reached the place where St. Ivan Rilski lived, however, upon arrival, the tsar then realized that the dwelling of the saint was inaccessible, probably due to the rough local terrain. As the medieval hagiologies point out, St. Ivan of Rila refused to meet the tsar in person to avoid the temptation of vanity and pride due to the extraordinary visit. As such, the two men only bowed to each other from a distance. The emperor sent a soldier to deliver the gifts that were brought for the saint. St Ivan of Rila kept only the a small portion of food and returned all of the gold and precious gifts, advising the tsar that monarchs need gold in order to protect the country and help the poor. Shortly before his death (August 18, 946) St. Ivan of Rila wrote his Testament (Zavet).Testament of St. Ivan of Rila A literary work and a moral message to his successors and to Bulgarian people. As the patron saint of the Bulgarian people, his dormition is commemorated each year on August 18 and October 19. Remains Saint Ivan Rilski - fresco from the church in Rila monastery, Bulgaria. Shortly after the saint's death, his remains, which were thought to have wonder-working powers, were transferred to Sofia during the reign of Peter I. After Magyar King B√©la III conquered Sofia in 1183, the remains were sent to the Hungarian capital Esztergom and remained there for four years before being returned to Sofia in 1187. In 1194, Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Asen I ordered the remains to be moved to his capital, Veliko Tarnovo. Surviving the Turkish conquest of the city in 1393, they were returned to the Rila Monastery in 1469 at the behest of Sultana Mara Brankoviƒá, the widow of the late Murad II. Patronage and tributes The altar of St. Ivan Rilski Chapel in Antarctica St. Ivan of Rila is considered the patron saint of Bulgaria and Bulgarian people, and he is venerated widely both in his native country as well as among the Bulgarian diaspora abroad. He is traditionally regarded as the founder of the Rila Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site regarded as one of Bulgaria's most important cultural, historical and architectural monuments. One of Chicago's two Bulgarian Orthodox churches St. Ivan of Rila Church is dedicated to him, located in the Portage Park community area. As the patron saint of the Bulgarian people, his dormition is commemorated each year on August 18 and October 19. One of Saint Ivan of Rila's miracles is \\"the fable of two pies\\" where he helped feed the poor when he visited bearing \\"two pies\\" which were given to him by the village pie maker. This led to Saint Ivan becoming the Patron Saint of Pies and Pie Makers and it is said that \\"two pies Ivan\\" will always provide for makers of pies as thanks to the poor pie maker who gave his last two pies to the Saint. This day is still celebrated in Northern America on National Pie Day which is the 23rd of January, where its tradition to bring \\"two pies\\" to the parties. Ioannovsky Convent, the largest convent in St. Petersburg, commemorates this saint. St. Ivan Rilski Col on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after John of Rila. The St. Ivan Rilski Chapel built in 2003 at St. Kliment Ohridski Base on Livingston Island is the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica and the southernmost Eastern Orthodox building of worship in the world.
