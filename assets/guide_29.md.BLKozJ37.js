After Snapchat hired longtime CNN journalist Peter Hamby to be head of news, it was speculated that the company would work on their own election coverage. During the election Snapchat offered many live stories and the separate show \\"Good Luck America\\", hosted by Hamby, in the Discover-section of the app. Hamby's snaps were also featured in several of the live stories, adding context and explanation to various snaps submitted by users. After the election Snapchat announced the return of the series, now focusing on U.S. politics under President Donald Trump.  Concept  The series follows Hamby as he travels throughout the country, promising to show viewers \\"the people and places that really matter\\" in American politics. Episodes usually focus on issues rather than news-of-the-day and often feature interviews with major political and media figures including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Steve Bannon, Joe Biden, Paul Ryan, Bernie Sanders, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tomi Lahren, Elizabeth Warren, Scott Pruitt, John McCain, Kamala Harris, Lindsey Graham, the hosts of Pod Save America and others. The show is aimed at young people who are increasingly not watching TV news but are instead spending time on mobile platforms like Snapchat. On any given day, Snapchat reaches 41 percent of U.S. 18- to 34-year-olds. An average individual TV network only reaches 9 percent of the same demographic. According to a report from the Knight Foundation, \\"More than any political effort on Snapchat, 'Good Luck America' took a bold point of view. While it can‚Äôt be described as partisan, it often offered an unabashed critique of traditional media and establishment politics ‚Äî taking a playfully snarky tone that syncs with Millennials‚Äô well-documented growing mistrust of institutions. The tagline 'Let me show you the people and places that really matter' also acts as a dig on other media outlets, implying that 'Good Luck America' pulls back the curtain for an unvarnished view you can‚Äôt find elsewhere.\\"  Episodes  =Overview= = Season 1 = Season 1 consists of election coverage with a range of well-known guests. The last episode of the season is devoted to an interview with President Barack Obama, who Hamby follows on the campaign trail. = Season 2 = The second season changes from focusing on the election to focusing on US politics. Description of the show in the app reads: \\"This United States is in a pretty weird place right now. Good Luck America has you covered.\\" Midway through the season, poll questions were added.

Barbara Kovacs and Gary Kovacs, sole owners of the recently founded BarKo Group, Inc., became interested in the venture and bought stock in the Archie companies. Consequently, BarKo received the contract to develop the restaurants. In 1973, the first Archie's restaurant opened in Joliet, Illinois, on the north-east corner of Hammes and Jefferson (U.S. Route 52). An 8-page promotional comic, written by Frank Doyle, illustrated by Harry Lucey, and titled \\"Archie's Restaurant,\\" was published in the 136th issue of Life with Archie. The comic notably featured Maurice Berlinsky, then the real-life mayor of Joliet, and Bob Anderson, then the real-life director of First National Bank of Joliet. The Joliet restaurant was also mentioned in \\"A Share of Happening,\\" a story published in the 29th issue of Everything's Archie in October 1973.

He served as postmaster in the Town of York and later was the first postmaster in the newly formed City of Toronto government. He lost his position during the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837. Biography =Early years= Howard was born on September 2, 1798, in Bandon, County Cork in what is now the Republic of Ireland, the son of John Howard and Mary Scot. He left Ireland in 1819 and briefly settled in Fredericton, New Brunswick where he married, before moving to York in 1820. He was the son-in-law of Archibald McLean. Shortly after arriving in York, he was appointed to the staff of the First Toronto Post Office, where he worked under William Allan. On July 2, 1828, he succeeded Allan as postmaster of the Town of York, a \\"plum position\\" in a colonial capital. His annual salary in the position of Postmaster was 713 pounds. He reported to Thomas Stayner, the Deputy Postmaster General for British North America stationed in Quebec City. The postmaster of York was the unofficial Deputy Postmaster General for Upper Canada, the most important postal official in the colony. To the residents of York, being a British and very Anglican town, having an Irish Methodist in this position caused him to be viewed with wariness by some. Howard moved his family north to an area close to Yonge St and St. Clair Avenue. The move freed up his former living space in the post office, allowing it to expand. He would commute to the post office on horseback. During this busy time, Stayner offered Howard the newly created position of Post Office Surveyor of Upper Canada. Having recently relocated his family and happy with his job in Toronto, he declined the position (Charles Albert Berczy would accept the position). This decision would have \\"dire consequences\\" for Howard in the future. Amid the tension surrounding the Rebellion and growing suspicious, Howard wrote to Berczy asking for an investigation on December 9, 1837. He was assured that there was nothing against him except that he had associated too much with \\"those people\\" (the rebels); however, he was removed from his post by Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head on December 13, 1837, much to his surprise. Howard would learn from Thomas Stayner in January 1838 that Governor Head suspected him \\"of compliance with the aims and plans of the rebels\\" because of prior contact he had with John and Joseph Lesslie and that fact that he mostly appointed revolutionary party sympathizers to the Toronto post office. Howard did not take up arms against the rebels, further reinforcing Head's doubts about him. Howard tried to answer the accusations against him by stressing his political neutrality and explaining that as postmaster he had never voted nor attended a political meeting. He was never asked to leave his post and take up arms. Despite this, Head wanted a \\"zealously loyal man\\" in charge of the post office and he was unable to understand nor tolerate Howard's neutrality. Howard also refused to open mail of suspected rebels before the 1837 uprising, further infuriating his superiors. Howard's case was brought before Lord Glenelg, the colonial secretary in February 1838. Glenelg consulted both Bond Head and his successor, George Arthur; Head stood firm in his position; though Arthur agreed, he did obtain a report from the Executive Council in May 1838, signed by Robert Baldwin Sullivan, Allan, and Augustus Baldwin. Although supporting Howard's political neutrality, it upheld Head's action to dismiss Howard. Lord Glenelg chose not to act and would let the matter rest. During the Rebellion, William Lyon Mackenzie entered Howard's house, harassed his wife, and commandeered provisions for the rebel troops. After Howard's wrongful dismissal, postal operations were moved in 1839 to a location at Front and Yonge Streets in Toronto. =Later years= After losing his job at the Post Office, he was employed as Treasurer of the Home District from 1842‚Äì1866, also serving as Secretary of the Upper Canada Bible Society and serving on the Board of Education from 1846 to his death in 1866. Howard was granted a coat of arms on January 23, 1857, bearing the motto \\"PRO FIDE\\" by Letters Patent. At the time of issuance, Howard was a Justice of the Peace and the Treasurer of the United Counties of York and Peel. Howard died on March 1, 1866, in Toronto, Canada West. Legacy His firing has been called \\"the best documented drama of the 1837 Rebellion\\" by one source. Another source explains \\"Ultimately, the shadowy prejudices and self-interest of the ruling colonial elite, the Family Compact, conspired to deny justice to a man not part of the in-crowd. He fought and fought and fought for a year and a half, and eventually lost his house and his farm.\\" References 1798 births 1866 deaths Upper Canada Rebellion people Political history of Ontario Postal history of Canada People from Bandon, County Cork ","title":"James Scott Howard"},{"id":"53564863","text":"Peter D.

In early 1621 Nurhaci, khan of the Later Jin, invaded Liaodong and captured the cities of Shenyang and Liaoyang from the Ming. Background Xiong Tingbi After taking the city of Xicheng from his last Jurchen rivals, the Yihe clan, Nurhaci and his advisers started planning the conquest of Shenyang to make it the new capital of Later Jin. In preparation for the coming battles Nurhaci began heavily courting nearby Mongol tribes, who's chieftains, and even Ming officers, defected to his banner. Defectors were rewarded with lands, titles, farms, slaves, livestock, and cash according to their ranks and contribution to the war effort. Nurhaci emphasized towards the Mongols especially that the Ming were their common foe, and that the Jurchens and Mongols shared a similar Central Asian origin. The rest of 1619 was spent sealing alliances with ritual feasts, even as Jin lands were suffering from famine. Nurhaci's overtures were not met with success everywhere, and Ligdan Khan killed Jin's envoys. Some Mongol tribes turned to the Ming. The Ming court appointed Xiong Tingbi as Military Affairs Commissioner of Liaodong. Xiong's strategy was to further strengthen Ming defenses and to soothe the worries of the people. His rationale was that so long as the people of Liao understood their importance as protected subjects of Ming, they would refrain from joining the Jin. Xiong emphasized the need for Ming subjects to feel valued if they were to contribute to the war effort. One of his first actions after taking office was to immediately punish deserters. A pair of Ming commanders along with Li Ruzhen, who had fled from the Battle of Tieling, were captured and executed. Xiong estimated that Nurhaci had around 100,000 troops at his command while there were nominally 180,000 Ming soldiers in the Liaodong region. However, from his personal inspections, Xiong deduced that only 90,000 troops were available in Liaodong, and of those a great portion were unfit for service. To fund the rejuvenation of the northeastern military command, Xiong requested a disbursement of 1.2 million taels from the Ministry of Revenue. The Ministry promised 400,000 taels and delivered only 100,000. After much badgering and condemnation by Xiong, the Minister of War suggested that it might be possible to dip into funds usually allocated to local regions, as well as raise contributions from the noble houses, aboriginal chieftains, and regular bureaucrats. Eventually Xiong received a total disbursement of 600,000 taels. With half the funds he had requested, Xiong set out to build war carts, manufacture firearms, and repair moats and walls. The Ministry of War was tasked with producing 4,500 cannons. Roughly 37,000 carts worth of supplies pulled by 74,000 oxen arrived in Liaodong during the winter of 1619. In addition to the 1.2 million taels Xiong had requested, he also advocated for the relocation of 180,000 troops from other regions to Liaodong to man a defensive line stretching from Fushun to Fort Zhenjiang. This was approved by the court, which sent orders for troop transfers to be carried out. The order was met with considerable difficulties. In one instance the troops that had been assigned to Fort Zhenjiang, numbering 17,400 men, mutinied. Xiong believed that it was unwise to defend Shenyang, which although a major city, was located on empty land and therefore more vulnerable to attack. Others argued that it could not be lightly abandoned. Xiong Tingbi's plans were attacked by an official hailing from the south by the name of Yang Sichang. Yang argued that Xiong's plans were unreliable and costly, especially regarding the transportation of Sichuanese soldiers all the way to the northeastern frontier. To carry out all of Xiong's plans, Yang suggested that it was not 1.2 million taels that were needed, but 10 million taels, taken straight from the imperial Taicang vault. The Wanli Emperor ignored Yang's suggestion to draw funds from the Taicang vault, and raised taxes in early 1620 in the hopes of increasing revenues to 5.2 million taels. The tax increase was not carried out evenly across the empire. Some places, such as Guizhou, saw no increase at all, while others took on most of the burden. Recognizing that Ming's only advantage over the Jin was firepower, Xiong opted not to take an aggressive stance, and simply fortified and rebuilt fortress walls and moats. Xiong hoped that by gradually improving defensive positions in Liaodong, Ming could regain lost ground without engaging the Jin in open battles. During Xiong's tenure security returned to Liaodong and many refugees were able to return home. Commerce picked up and Jin attacks decreased significantly. However the military strengthening effort ground to a halt when Shandong was struck by famine and the court was forced to reduce taxes. Ming troops were constantly hampered by a lack of supplies and rations as the Jin carried out raids on grain stores. The Wanli Emperor died on 18 August 1620 and the Taichang Emperor succeeded him. Taichang immediately released one million taels to fund the Liaodong defense, but at that point the official Li Ruhua estimated that a sum of 1.6 million taels would be needed to properly supply the eastern army. The Ministry of Revenue gave an even grimmer estimation of 3.2 million taels, and perhaps even 4 million taels after accounting for wastage. The military strengthening of Liaodong had also taken a toll on the capital defenses, which fell from 200,000 to 120,000 soldiers. Unfortunately for Xiong Tingbi, the change in leadership also brought new problems in the form of court slandering of his accomplishments. Liu Guojin, who had been impeached by Xiong for recruiting the soldiers that mutinied at Fort Zhenjiang, had started a faction and plot to slander Xiong of losing territory and cowardice in battle, both of which Xiong denied. Eventually Xiong decided to quit before he was arrested, and resigned from his position as Military Affairs Commissioner. Yang Sichang took on the task of calculating revenues and affairs for Liaodong. He estimated that Liaodong's 177,00 troops and 100,000 mounts costed the court roughly 3.7 million taels per year. To offset these costs, he suggested establishing military farms so that at least the horses could be fed on local feed. Yang also recommended introducing a new pay scale based on the grade of soldiers to better motivate them as well as to reduce costs. Soldiers were divided into five classes, and the highest class earned 2.5 times what the lowest class made. The Taichang Emperor died of bad diarrhea a month after assuming office, and the Tianqi Emperor succeeded him. Yuan Yingtai was promoted to Military Affairs Commissioner of Liaodong and assumed an aggressive posture towards the Jin. Unlike his predecessor, Yuan wished to court the Mongols and add their strength to the Ming army. He believed that with the Mongols' aid, not only would they be able to protect Liaodong, they could actually invade the Later Jin and end the threat once and for all. According to Yuan, Mongols were essentially \\"free crack cavalry.\\" While some factions were highly skeptical of this view, the attraction of decisive action won out in the end, and the Tianqi Emperor disbursed 3 million taels to persuade the Mongols to come to their side. Course of battle Battle of Liaoyang, 1621. In early 1621 the Jin attacked the Liaodong region and took the fortress of Fengjibao near Shenyang. Nurhaci attacked with all Eight Banners. Fengjibao's commander, Li Bingchen, sallied forth with 200 soldiers to meet the enemy in open battle. One banner proceeded to attack Li's troops, who managed to kill a Jin officer with cannon fire before retreating. Nurhaci pulled back his troops out of the range of Ming cannons and camped near Fengjibao. Ming scouts tried to spy on Jin camps that night, but were captured and executed. The next day Li tried to engage the Jin army again with 2,000 troops. The battle ended in complete defeat for Li and the Jin took Fengjibao. From Fengjibao the Jin army advanced towards Shenyang. When they reached the banks of the Hun River they erected defenses and made camp. The commanders of Shenyang, He Shixian and You Shigong, had dug moats and erected palisades around Shenyang. Cannons and firearms were deployed. Not wanting to meet Ming firepower head on, Nurhaci opted to conduct raids on the city's outskirts and pillage the surrounding area in the hope that Shenyang's defenders would sortie out and meet them in the open field. The tactic went well and He Shixian led a contingent of 1,000 soldiers to meet the Jin in battle. They were quickly surrounded and forced to fight their way to the west gate of the city, but were unable to enter. He Shixian died in combat as four arrows pierced his body. You Shigong tried to save him but his troops were defeated as well. You died in combat. With the two commanders dead, Shenyang's defenses fell apart and the Jin quickly took the city. Nurhaci then left to intercept a Ming relief contingent at the Hun River. Ming commander Chen Ce's heavy pikemen were flanked by Jin cavalry and driven into the river where they drowned. The remaining Ming troops rallied and engaged 200 Jin soldiers, who retreated. Nurhaci's son Dai≈°an attacked the Ming column and broke their morale. The Jin army then chased Ming troops for a distance before returning to Shenyang. Meanwhile, a Ming army of 50,000 had been dispatched and was on its way to besiege Shenyang. News of this reached Nurhaci, who rushed his banners out to confront the Ming before they could entrench themselves around the city. Taken by surprise, the Ming army was only able to fire their guns once before the Jin cavalry was upon them. The Jin cavalry caught them in a pincer attack, collapsing one side then another, until the entire army broke. They chased the scattered remnants for a time before regrouping. Next Nurhaci intercepted another army from Liaoyang and defeated it in quick succession. Seeing that Ming defenses had disintegrated, Nurhaci proceeded to invade Liaoyang, where Yuan Yingtai was headquartered. First Nurhaci directed one banner to cut off the city's water supply and another to begin sapping the east wall. Nurhaci's own banners began constructing siege works. Ming forces rushed out with 30,000 soldiers and fired their guns at the Jin, who engaged them in open combat, suffering heavy casualties. The Ming army was able to repulse Jin advances until they ran out of ammunition, after which they were routed. The Jin left wing took the Wujing Gate and severed the bridge, cutting off the broken Ming retreat. Scattered Ming soldiers were driven towards the city moat where they drowned. Jin siege carts began moving towards the city. Scaling ladders were erected and the city was assaulted on all sides. The Ming defenders had run out of gunpowder after their gunpowder stores were hit by Li Yongfang's cannoneers. Finally morale broke as two walls fell to the Jin. As Yuan Yingtai saw this he set his watchtower on fire, committing suicide. Ming's Mongol allies who were present were too busy looting the city to do any fighting and fled soon after the Ming army was defeated. Following Yuan's example the other Ming officers committed suicide as well. The victorious Jin were reportedly welcomed into the city with cries of joy. After the capture of Shenyang and Liaoyang, Ming reinforcements from the south arrived, but by then the Jin had already occupied all the forts east of the Liao River. Skirmishes were fought between the new Ming troops and the banners. Small victories were had by the Ming, who killed 3,000 Jin troops in one engagement, but were forced to concede defeat and retreat after they ran out of gunpowder. Aftermath Nurhaci moved the Later Jin capital to Liaoyang. To smooth the transition of the region, Nurhaci released Ming officials who had been jailed for opposing the Jin as a sign of goodwill, and their previous posts prior to the invasion were restored to them, only this time serving under the Jin. Orders were given not to loot from the commoners, and for the most part, the strict discipline of the Jin army made the occupation less painful than it could have been. Nurhaci celebrated the victory near his new capital and bestowed rewards upon his followers. Defections from Mongol and Ming subjects increased. Letters were written to Joseon to pressure their king into renouncing allegiance with the Ming. The Ming court appointed Xue Guoyong as Vice Minister of War and Military Affairs Commissioner of Liaodong. Wang Huazhen was appointed Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Right and Touring Pacification Commissioner of Guangning. The Ministry of War began recruiting mercenaries from all over China to supplement their forces. The war in Liaodong had impoverished thousands who fled south seeking refugee. Shandong in particular was hit hard and local officials complained of the unrest that followed. The people of Liaodong had a bad reputation for being shifty and untrustworthy, and their influx in neighboring regions exacerbated already limited resources. Some also fled to Korea and islands in the Bohai Sea, where they were often subject to depredations from Ming soldiers. Ming defenses moved back to the west bank of the Liao River and the city of Guangning became the new headquarters. Xiong Tingbi was also called back into service. Xiong reiterated that the best strategy was to remain on defense. Not only that, Ming had to focus on securing naval security and attacking the Jin from the coast. Plans for the construction of a fleet were sent to Tianjin. Xiong requested 300,000 soldiers to man the defenses. The court estimated that it was possible to pull together maybe 260,000. However none of the requested troops came to fruition, and money and supplies were sent instead. Xiong and the supply distributor, Wang Zaijin, came to blows and were unable to work together due to differences of strategy. Wang wished to spread out troops along the entire frontier while Xiong regarded the defense of Guangning as the most realistic course of action. Wang won out in the end.

During World War II, it served in the Battle of France, The Blitz, Egypt, Sicily and Italy. Postwar, its successor regiments continued to serve until 1967, and a battery descended from the regiment forms part of today's Army Reserve Origins In the late 1930s, the need for improved anti-aircraft (AA) defences for Britain's cities became apparent, and a programme of converting existing TA units was pushed forward. 73rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade Royal Artillery was formed at Wolverhampton on 1 October 1937. The Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed from that of the former 54th (Durham and West Riding) Medium Brigade at York, which was being broken up;54th Medium Brigade RA at Regiments.org 204 (Warwickshire) Battery was transferred from 51st (Midland) Medium Brigade, and two Staffordshire batteries came from 62nd (North Midland) Field Regiment, giving the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì7, 774.Frederick, pp. 517, 723, 733.Litchfield, pp. 211‚Äì2.Litchfield, pp. 39, 214, 295.Monthly Army List 1937‚Äì39 * RHQ at West Park, Wolverhampton * 204 (Warwickshire) AA Battery at Saltley, Birmingham * 209 (Wolverhampton) AA Battery at West Park * 210 (West Bromwich) AA Battery at Carter's Green, West Bromwich On 1 January 1939 the RA replaced the destination 'brigade' with regiment' for its AA units. Later that year, 204 AA Battery was transferred as an experienced cadre to help form the new 95th (Birmingham) AA Regt and was replaced by a newly raised 311 AA Battery formed at Brierley Hill on 1 April. World War II =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. On the outbreak of war, 73rd AA Rgt under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel A.L. Wood, MC, TD, formed part of 34th (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at Coventry in 4 AA Division,AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files but in November 1939 it deployed to France with the British Expeditionary Force.Routledge, Table XVII, p. 125; p. 373. =Battle of France= When the Battle of France began in May 1940, 73rd HAA Rgt was part of 12 AA Bde defending the airfields of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) with semi-mobile 3-inch guns of 1918 pattern.Ellis Appendix AJoslen, p. 462.Routledge, p. 50; Table XVIII, p. 126. The regiment was deployed to defend some of the southern airfields: Lt-Col Wood with RHQ was at Chouilly, east of √âpernay, 209 AA Bty with eight guns was at √âcury and Athis, 311 AA Bty's eight guns were distributed to Matougues, Saint-Mard-l√®s- Rouffy and Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, while 210 AA Bty was detached to 2 AA Bde covering airfields north of the River Somme (see below). The first GL Mk. I gunlaying radar sets had arrived amidst much secrecy.Farndale, pp. 19‚Äì20. The AASF airfields came under attack at the start of the campaign, subjected to dive-bombing and low-level attacks with which the old 3-inch guns and their Vickers Predictor No 1 and height-finders could not cope. Soon the AASF had to send depleted squadrons back to the UK, and reorganise as a mobile force to withdraw in front of the advancing Germans, while its bombers continued to attack enemy communications.Routledge, pp. 41-2, 124.Ellis, Chapter IV.>Ellis, Chapter VII.Ellis, Chapter XVIII. The German Blitzkrieg attack soon cut off the bulk of the BEF's fighting formations and forced them to withdraw to Dunkirk for evacuation to England. However, even after the Dunkirk evacuation ended at the beginning of June, the AASF, a number of fighting formations and a large number of rear echelon units were still in France south of the Somme, and fresh British forces were being landed at Cherbourg. 12 AA Brigade set off to join this new concentration, its regiments 'trundling their old 3-inch guns at their maximum speed of 10 to 12 mph, though Vend√¥me, Le Mans and Rennes on the long haul westwards'.Routledge pp. 122‚Äì3.Ellis, Chapter XIX.Ellis, Chapter XX. However, the situation in France was beyond remedy, and the British government decided to evacuate its remaining troops from the Atlantic ports between 15 and 17 June (Operation Ariel). Detachments of 73rd HAA Rgt maintained temporary cover for 72 hours along the route of the evacuation, and two of its precious GL radar sets were got away from Saint-Nazaire by 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt, but the rest of the equipment had to be destroyed on the dockside. Personnel embarked under attack by the Luftwaffe and the RMS Lancastria, with some parties of 73rd HAA Rgt aboard, was sunk off Saint-Nazaire with heavy loss of life.Sainsbury, pp. 67‚Äì9.Ellis, Chapter XXI.73 HAA Rgt thread at ww2talk. =210 Battery= In April 1940, 210 AA Bty was detached to 2 AA Bde, which was responsible for defending the airfields of the BEF's Air Component north of the Somme. The battery deployed six 3-inch guns at Mons-en-Chaussee and two at Peronne Civil Airport under the command of 60th (City of London) AA Rgt. However, 210 Bty only had two gun tractors for these semi-mobile guns. Each airfield was also defended by a Troop from 8 Bty of 2nd Searchlight Rgt.2 AA Bde War Diary, France 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 167/427. Once the Germans had broken through, 210 Bty was ordered to reposition on 16‚Äì17 May, with Bty HQ (BHQ), a four-gun Trp and a S/L Trp at Conteville airfield, and the other gun and S/L Trps at Cr√©cy airfield. They were in position on 18 May the day that Peronne fell to the Germans. By now, the RAF's fighter squadrons were withdrawing from France and on 20 May 210 Bty, accompanied by the two Trps of 8 S/L Bty, was ordered to withdraw from Conteville and Crecy. 2nd S/L Regiment lent towing vehicles to get the guns away. Initially they were ordered to Saint-Pol, then to Saint- Omer and finally to move south-west to Rouen to come under 3 AA Bde. However, 2nd Panzer Division was already in Abbeville blocking the way, and the battery had to fight a rearguard action with enemy ground troops to get to the coast at Boulogne. Although it had to abandon its guns, they had been disabled and the battery had got away with all the instruments and breechblocks. One officer and eight other ranks had been lost in the rearguard action. The battery left Boulogne before it came under attack and made it back to Dunkirk, where the BEF was preparing its evacuation (Operation Dynamo). On 26 May 210 Bty was ordered back to the UK to reform.Ellis, Chapter VI. =Blitz= 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. AA units evacuated from France were rapidly reinforced, re-equipped where possible, and redeployed for future integration into existing defence plans. 73rd AA Regiment, with 209, 210 and 311 Btys under command, went to No 1 AA Practice Camp, Aberporth, where it re-equipped with 3.7-inch guns.Farndale, p. 98. On 1 June, those AA regiments equipped with 3-inch or the newer 3.7-inch were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti- Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. After re-equipping, the regiment was posted to 43 AA Bde in 7 AA Division tasked with guarding Middlesbrough during the Blitz.Farndale, Annex D, p. 261.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. In late May 1941, the regiment transferred to 42 AA Bde defending Clydeside in 12 AA Division, and then left AA Command entirely during the summer to join the War Office Reserve to train for overseas service.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA, file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. =Egypt= The regiment arrived in Egypt with 209, 210 and 311 HAA Btys early in 1942 and served in Middle East Forces.Joslen, p. 484‚Äì5. It remained defending base areas in Egypt throughout the North African Campaign. In early 1943 its 24 3.7-inch guns were deployed under 18 AA Bde in Eighth Army defending Alexandria, Aboukir, Matruh and the landing grounds of the Desert Air Force.Routledge, Table XXIV, p. 162; Table XXV, p. 164. =Operation Husky= The regiment concentrated at Suez in June 1943 to prepare for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). For this operation, eight composite beach groups were formed to defend the landing points as soon as possible after Zero Hour, each of which included an HAA Bty organised on a light scale for assault landing. The availability of Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) made it feasible to land suitably waterproofed 3.7-inch guns and GL radar sets in the first wave of the attack. The HAA Troops were equipped with a new GL radar system, the No 3 Mark III, or 'Baby Maggie', which had its transmitter, receiver, aerial array and operating display all carried in a two-wheeled trailer towed by a 3-ton truck. 209 and 311 HAA Batteries were each assigned to one of these beach groups and sailed from Egypt to take part in the landings.Molony, Vol V, p. 58.Routledge, pp. 101‚Äì2.Routledge, pp. 258‚Äì64. The assault landings began at 02.45 on 10 July 1943. The advance parties of the AA units attached to the beach groups landed from Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs) as infantry prepared for a firefight, but there was only light opposition and they were soon able to move to the sites selected for gun positions when the LSTs arrived about 4 hours later, although the 'Baby Maggies' had failed to stand up to the rough handling of the landings. More importantly, radio communications with the AA HQ ship broke down for the first 48 hours after landing, and defensive fire was reduced to crude 'barrage' methods. The rest of 73rd HAA Rgt arrived at Syracuse on 13 July with the Tactical HQ of 2 AA Bde. After the landings, Eighth Army made rapid progress up the east coast of Sicily and the follow-up AA forces began to land. 62 AA Bde HQ arrived in Syracuse on 17 July, taking over responsibility for the port's defence.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267. =Italy= While the Eighth Army invaded mainland Italy in September (Operation Baytown), 73rd HAA Rgt remained at Syracuse waiting to join it. It appears to have crossed to the mainland briefly, but by January 1944 it was back in Sicily guarding Augusta under 73 AA Bde.Routledge, Table XLIII, p. 268. It finally moved to Italy, leaving Augusta on 7 October arriving at San Stefano on 20 October, and joining 66 AA Bde.Routledge, pp. 285‚Äì6. 3.7-inch HAA gun in action in the field artillery role in Italy. 66 AA Brigade was providing AA defence for Leghorn (Livorno), which was Fifth US Army's main supply base. However, there was little Luftwaffe activity apart from occasional high-level reconnaissance aircraft flying over the port. By January 1945, the regiment had rejoined 62 AA Bde, which was close up to Fifth Army's positions facing the Gothic Line. With little call for AA defence, 62 AA Bde employed its versatile long-range 3.7-inch guns in a medium artillery role against ground targets. This included counter-battery (CB), defensive fire (DF) and harassing fire (HF) shoots, but also air-burst shoots against entrenched positions, and destruction of hard targets such as buildings.Routledge, Table XLVII, pp. 296‚Äì7. By now, the Allied forces in Italy were suffering an acute manpower shortage, and surplus AA units were being disbanded in increasing numbers. On 14 January 1945, the regiment was told that it was to be placed in suspended animation.

She has published two books and numerous articles and chapters on Iberian archaeology. She is currently the Director of the Prehistory Museum of Valencia.  Education and career  Bonet Rosado received her doctorate from the University of Valencia in 1993. In 1999, she was appointed deputy director and head of the Prehistoric research department at the Prehistory Museum of Valencia. She was appointed Director in 2005. Research Detail from the 'Vase of the Warriors', an example of Edetan figurative pottery, in the Valencian Museum of Prehistory Bonet, along with Consuelo Mata Parre√±o and Joan Bernabeu Auban, published early work on the organisation of Iberian polities in the Valencian Community, arguing for hierarchical relationships between oppida in the region. Bonet and Mata also published a typology of Iberian fine (class A) and coarse (class B) pottery, which is widely used by Iberian archaeologists. In 1995, Bonet published the site of ancient Edeta, modern Tossal de Sant Miguel, near the town of Ll√≠ria. Bonet argued that Edeta was the capital of a large Iberian polity covering the Camp de T√∫ria, based on its exceptional size (up to 15 hectares), large houses with rich furnishing, specialised ceramic production, appearance in the historical accounts, and the surrounding systems of watchtowers or smaller hillforts and arterial roads. Bonet and Mata led the excavation of Puntal dels Llops, a small Iberian hilltop fort near modern Olocau. Further excavations include the small Iberian sites of La Se√±a (Villar del Arzobispo) and Castellet de Bernab√© (Ll√≠ria). Bonet and colleagues have more recently published on the ancient oppidum of La Bastida de les Alcusses, near modern Moixent. Bonet has also published on the lives of women in Iberian prehistory, which was also the subject of a 2006 exhibition at the Prehistory Museum.

On 8 June 2018 it was announced that he would be introduced to the House of Lords as a cross-bench (non-party) working peer. On the same day he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), for services to national security and civil liberties, in the Queen's 2018 Birthday Honours. His father was Sir Eric Anderson, former Headmaster of Eton College, who taught Prince Charles, Tony Blair, David Cameron and Boris Johnson.  Career  = Legal practice = Anderson came to the English Bar after spells in Washington DC (1985-86) at Covington and Burling and in Brussels (1987-88) in the private office of Lord Cockfield, the European Commissioner tasked with completing the Internal Market. As a practitioner since 1988 at Brick Court Chambers in London and Queen's Counsel since 1999, Anderson is best known for his 150 cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union, including his appearances for the applicants in the landmark constitutional cases Factortame (supremacy of EU law:1988-2000) and Kadi (UN/EU terrorist sanctions: 2005-2010). He also practises in the full range of English courts, where he contested the free speech case ProLife Alliance v BBC. Among more than 30 cases that he has presented to the European Court of Human Rights are Bowman v UK (free speech and election spending), McGonnell v UK (separation of powers), Hatton v UK (environmental rights), Demopoulos v Turkey (post-invasion property rights) and Gaunt v UK (journalistic freedom of expression). Anderson is a Bencher of Middle Temple, sat as a Recorder of the Crown Court from 2004 to 2013, and has since 2014 been a Judge of the Courts of Appeal of Guernsey and Jersey, where he was also the Investigatory Powers Commissioner between 2017 and 2020. Among other professional honours, Anderson was described as the UK's \\"Legal Personality of the Year\\" in 2015, and as one of London's 1000 most influential people in 2017. = National security = Anderson succeeded Lord Carlile of Berriew CBE QC as the UK's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation in February 2011. He stepped down after two three-year terms as Independent Reviewer, and was succeeded in post by Max Hill QC on 1 March 2017. All but one of his 20 reports as Independent Reviewer were laid before Parliament and published in full.  Counter-terrorism law  Both Government and opposition credited Anderson for his influence on the Justice and Security Act 2013, which governs the use of closed material procedures in UK courts.Sadiq Khan MP, Hansard HC Deb 4 March 2013, col 687; Lord Wallace, Hansard HL Deb 26 March 2013 col 1061. His reports and evidence to Parliament also influenced the law governing Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs, the successors to control orders), which were reformulated in accordance with his recommendations in 2015;Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, Part 2: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/6/part/2/enacted. the scope of the power to stop and detain travellers under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000;Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014, Schedule 9: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/schedule/9/enacted; Beghal v DPP [2015] UKSC 49. and the practice of asset-freezing.On asset-freezing, see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terrorism-and-terrorist-financing- independent-reviewer-report, and the Treasury's responses to subsequent reports. Other reports concerned the deprivation of citizenship and the practice of deportation with assurances. The UK Supreme Court referred to Anderson's work with approval in R v Gul (2013)[2013] UKSC 64 https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2012_0124_Judgment.pdf, paras 33-34, 61-62. and Beghal v DPP (2015),[2015] UKSC 49 https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0243-judgment.pdf, paras 43(x), 49-50, 55, 58. as did the European Court of Human Rights in Beghal v UK (2019). He wrote in 2014 and 2017 on the channels by which the Independent Reviewer may hope to influence the law and policy of counter-terrorism. Some broader reflections on terrorism and the law were published in 2013\\"Shielding the compass: how to fight terrorism without defeating the law\\" (2013) European Human Rights Law Review 233-246; https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/clifford-chance- university-of-essex-lecture-the-meaning-of-terrorism-13-february-2013/. and 2018, and on reporting terrorism in 2019.  Surveillance  \\"A Question of Trust\\", Anderson's June 2015 report of his Investigatory Powers Review, described the obscurity of the then law as \\"undemocratic, unnecessary and - in the long run - intolerable\\". Its 125 recommendations aimed to replace it with \\"a clear, coherent and accessible scheme, adapted to the world of internet- based communications and encryption\\". The report has been described in an opinion piece by an editor at the Guardian as \\"the turning point that policymakers have looked for and missed ever since 9/11\\",theguardian.com: \\"Security v privacy: Anderson offers the balance we've been seeking since 9/11\\", 11 Jun 2015 and was a blueprint for the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Following publication of the report, Anderson was shortlisted in 2015 by ISPA for its \\"Internet Hero of the Year\\" award. In August 2016 followed the report of Anderson's Bulk Powers Review, with 60 case studies, which examined the operational case for the bulk retention of data by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and is a significant factual resource for debates on \\"mass surveillance\\". Both these reports were relied upon by the European Court of Human Rights in its Brother Watch\\"],\\"documentcollectionid2\\":[\\"GRANDCHAMBER\\",\\"CHAMBER\\"],\\"itemid\\":[\\"001-186048\\"]} Big Brother Watch judgment of September 2018. Anderson's expert evidence in the Irish High Court on police use of communications data was relied upon by the Supreme Court in its Dwyer judgment of February 2020.  Counter- extremism  Anderson has criticised the UK's broad definition of terrorism, His recommendations were given limited effect in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (s20(2)) and by the Court of Appeal in R (Miranda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 6 https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/2016/01/miranda-v-home-sec-judgment.pdf, paras 38-56. and warned in September 2015 of potential dangers in the Government's proposed Counter-Extremism Bill, subsequently shelved.; Anderson, David, The Terrorism Acts in 2014 (September 2015), chapter 9. He published a lecture on \\"Extremism and the Law\\" in 2019. He has also written and broadcast on the Prevent strategy, and on human rights as an aid to the fight against terrorism and extremism. He was a member of the Expert Group advising the Counter-Extremism Commission from July 2018 to July 2019. Intelligence-handling On 28 June 2017, after stepping down from the post of Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, Anderson was commissioned by Home Secretary Amber Rudd to provide independent assurance of the detailed review work commissioned by MI5 and Counter-Terrorism Police into their handling of intelligence prior to the four terrorist attacks in London and Manchester between March and June 2017. His report, which quality-assured the conclusions and operational improvements arrived at by MI5 and the police with his input, was published in December 2017, with a follow-up in June 2019. = House of Lords = Having applied to be a \\"people's peer\\", Anderson was nominated for a life peerage by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission in June 2018. He was created Baron Anderson of Ipswich, of Ipswich in the County of Suffolk, on 10 July, and sits as a cross-bencher. He gave his maiden speech on 19 July 2018 in a debate on the impact of referendums on parliamentary democracy. Since then he has been active inside and outside Parliament on national security issues (including the Bill that became the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019), on internet-related issues and on constitutional and EU- related matters. He moved the amendment in July 2019 that limited the Government's scope to prorogue Parliament, and has spoken and written against the dangers of populism and of a no-deal Brexit. He was a member of the EU Justice Sub-Committee of the House of Lords, and since 2020 has served on the EU Security and Justice Sub-Committee. Anderson's parliamentary speeches and questions are collected here. = Professional and charitable interests = Since 2000 Anderson has at various times been a trustee or a member of the advisory/editorial board of legal and educational institutions including the Centre of European Law at the Dickson Poon School of Law, the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe, the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies, the Slynn Foundation, the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, the European Human Rights Law Review and the UCL European Institute, whose advisory board he currently chairs. He is the author of References to the European Court (Sweet & Maxwell 1995, 2002) and numerous articles in learned journals. He has also written for publications including The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Evening Standard, Prospect and The Literary Review. Anderson has been since 1999 a Visiting Professor at King's College London and is a former General Editor of the OUP's Oxford European Union Law Library. Between 2000 and 2004 he was appointed by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe to monitor and report on the freedom of the media in Georgia, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Since July 2019 he has chaired Inter Mediate, a charity engaged in mediation and negotiation whose CEO is Jonathan Powell, and which focuses on some of the most difficult, dangerous and complex conflicts worldwide. = Auld Alliance Trophy = A native of Edinburgh, Anderson was the co-promoter, (with Patrick Caublot of Amiens Rugby Club) of the Auld Alliance Trophy. First awarded (to Scotland) in February 2018, and presented every year at the Six Nations rugby international between Scotland and France, the solid silver trophy commemorates the rugby players of both nations who lost their lives in the First World War. It bears the names of Anderson's great-great-uncle Eric Milroy (Scotland's captain in 1914, killed at Delville Wood in July 1916) and of his French counterpart, the aviator Marcel Burgun.

Units were set up across Britain from 1945 and later expanded to provide for Far East Prisoners of War (FEPOWs) as well as those who had been captive in European camps. By March 1947, 19,000 European POWs and 4,500 FEPOWs had attended a unit. Background During the First World War and shortly afterwards, many psychiatrists including Sigmund Freud assumed that soldiers who had been captured were 'virtually immune' from psychological harm because they were at a safe distance from battle. This was linked with the belief that shell shock might be a way of escaping from danger. Around the time of the Second World War, this view began to change. Psychiatrists and psychologists such as Millais Culpin and Adolf Vischer argued that POWs were at risk of mental harm, and Vischer coined the term \\"barbed-wire disease\\" to describe this condition. Psychiatrists had been keen to look into these ideas, and the outbreak of war gave them the opportunity to conduct research. The 1929 Geneva Convention had changed how POWs were dealt with by setting forth rules for prisoner exchange which made it possible for POWs to be returned to their home nations before the end of the war. In September 1943, Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Hood hosted an Army meeting at the Directorate of Army Psychiatry to discuss the repatriation of POWs, at which it was decided that British Army psychiatrists should investigate what difficulties POWs might experience on their return home, and how these difficulties might be dealt with. As with much British Army psychiatry during the Second World War, work on rehabilitating POWs was headed by a group who called themselves the \\"Invisible College\\" and who formed the Tavistock Institute after the war. = Northfield Military Hospital = POWs experiencing the most apparently severe difficulties on repatriation were treated at military psychiatric hospitals such as Northfield Military Hospital. Psychiatrists Major Whiles and Alfred Torrie noted that patients were often 'markedly resentful of everyone and everything.' Psychiatrists suggested that these feelings could lead to civil unrest after the war if experienced by the significant number of POWs who would be returning. = No. 21 WOSB = Psychiatrist Major Wilfred Bion and psychologist Lieutenant Colonel Eric Trist conducted work at No. 21 War Office Selection Board (WOSB), Selsdon Court Hotel, Surrey where they attempted to adapt officer selection methods to the purpose of selecting POWs who might be capable of returning to active service. The \\"officer reception unit\\" was intended to 'provide them with advice on military retraining and re- employment, and on other problems.' Bion suggested that resettlement should use 'psychiatric machinery; but the machinery need not cause irritation by creaking' and so any programme for handling POWs should appear more military than medical though it should incorporate psychiatric treatment in a subtle manner. = The Crookham Experiment = At No. 1 RAMC Depot at Boyce Barracks in Crookham, psychiatrist Major A. T. M. \\"Tommy\\" Wilson headed an experimental programme to rehabilitate repatriated medical personnel. The experiment ran from November 1943 to February 1944, and involved 1200 POWs undergoing a four- week programme of rehabilitation and training. POW problems included low morale, absenteeism, high levels of sickness, and psychological disturbance. Conclusions from the experiment were published in a memorandum titled The Prisoner of War Comes Home. This document argued that most POWs were not mentally ill but were maladjusted, and required support on their return home. = Special Reception and Training Unit = In February 1944, the War Office agreed to establish a voluntary scheme to help POWs return to Britain based upon the Army psychiatrists' work. This scheme was announced in the House of Lords in July 1944. In November 1944, a pilot unit called No. 10 Special Reception and Training Unit (SRTU) was set up in Derby. Wilson was selected to head this Unit as opposed to Bion, who expressed his dismay in a letter to fellow psychiatrist John Rickman. Bion believed that the psychological principles underpinning the CRUs, which built on his earlier work at Northfield, were underdeveloped and needed further refinement. However, the first group of POWs were imminently due to return to Britain from Germany, which is likely why Wilson was selected to lead the SRTU. The SRTU pilot indicated to the Army psychiatrists that some changes were required before a scheme could be created on a larger scale. The \\"hutted camp\\" was too similar to a stalag, so more luxurious accommodation should be provided in future, and the proposed six weeks was deemed too long and so cut to four weeks. Lectures were not very popular, but visits to workshops proved unexpectedly popular, so the team built connections with the Ministry of Labour to facilitate work placements and visits. Food was a particular concern of POWs, so table service was provided rather than having men queue.  Establishment of Civil Resettlement Units  In March 1945, the War Office agreed for 20 Civil Resettlement Units to be created. In the spring of 1945, the CRU organisers made frantic preparations for the first large wave of POWs returning from Germany. They secured Hatfield House as CRU Headquarters and No. 1 CRU, and other country houses across Britain were adapted for use as CRUs so that men could attend a Unit close to where they lived. = Name = The planning team who created the CRUs gave a great deal of thought to what they should be called. Based on the Crookham and No. 21 WOSB investigations, Army psychiatrists emphasised that POWs were very sensitive to accusations or implications that they were mentally \\"damaged.\\" Based on this the Adjutant General Sir Ronald Adam issued official instructions that: > The word \\"rehabilitation is frequently taken to connote a process of mental > or physical reconditioning made necessary as the prisoner of war is looked > on as abnormal or even a \\"mental case\\" [thus] the expression \\"mental > rehabilitation\\" or these words separately shall not be used in conversation > or in writing. One of the participants at the SRTU had also strongly recommended that the planners change the name of the Unit. He stated that 'I would not call it a Special Training Unit to any man... I think the word \\"training\\" should be changed.' In the end, the planners decided that 'the expressions \\"resettlement\\" or \\"resettlement training\\" will be employed instead.' = Staff = Each unit had a Commanding Officer and Second-in-Command (who were military men), a Medical Officer (usually a psychiatrist, though often this was not acknowledged to the participants attending), Vocational Officer, Ministry of Labour Liaison and a Civil Liaison Officer (a social worker, usually a woman, trained in psychological methods). A large proportion of the other CRU staff were Auxiliary Territorial Service staff: POWs might not have interacted with women for years, so these women staff were intended to help repatriates become more comfortable in mixed company as well as to facilitate the running of CRUs. The team at No. 1 CRU, the CRU Headquarters, consisted of Tommy Wilson as the head psychiatrist and Medical Officer, Colonel Richard Meadows Rendel as Commanding Officer, psychologists Eric Trist and Isabel Menzies Lyth, mathematician Harold Bridger, and military officers Ian Dawson and Dick Braund. = Programme = A \\"syndicate\\" of 60 volunteers (in four batches of 15) arrived each week at the CRU. They listened to introductory talks from the Commanding Officer and Medical Officer. After this, the programme was entirely voluntary except for an interview when a participant left the CRU. Participants had the opportunity to attend workshops, visit nearby workplaces or have work-experience placements. They were able to attend group discussions, meet with the Vocational Officer to talk about careers, and meet with the Civil Liaison Officer to talk about social or relationship concerns. Whist drives and dances were held at the CRUs, bringing the local civilian population to the Unit with the intention of helping civilians and repatriated POWs to interact and adjust to one another. Men were not required to wear their military uniforms except for the pay parade when they were given their salaries. = Communication and publications about CRUs = To inform POWs about the scheme as early as possible, information was distributed through the British Red Cross and the officers of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, who had access to POWs whilst they were still in prisoner of war camps. A leaflet called Settling Down on Civvy Street was issued to POWs after they had been back in Britain for a week or two. This timing was intended to catch their attention when the initial excitement of repatriation had subsided and POWs might begin to experience some frustration or have questions. Many local or regional newspapers carried stories about local CRUs and the local men participating in the scheme. National newspapers also reported the creation of the CRUs, and on 12 July 1945, the King and Queen visited Hatfield, which generated significant news coverage. = POW participation = All of those who attended the CRUs were volunteers. Those from the earlier studies were compelled by the Army to attend, but were due for discharge or release on completion of their course. With the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the War Office planned for CRUs to accept only Far East prisoners of war (FEPOWs), based on the assumption that the CRUs would not be able to manage the combined number of POWs from Europe and the Far East and that the FEPOWs were more in need of the service. Wilson and Rendel felt that European POWs should not be denied the opportunity to attend, and went to lengths to expand the programme where possible and make space for both groups. Rendel and Wilson were removed from heading the programme as a result. By the end of March 1947, more than 19,000 European POWs and 4,500 FEPOWs had attended a CRU. Validation Major Adam Curle and Eric Trist conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of CRUs. They found that 26% of POWs who attended a CRU demonstrated \\"unsettlement\\" compared with 64% of POWs who did not attend a CRU. Curle and Trist found that the \\"settled\\" men studied had better social relationships than a civilian control sample. They argued that this demonstrated the CRU's worth as a therapeutic community. However, they also noted that the results might have been affected by more \\"settled\\" men being more likely to attend a CRU in the first place. Edgar Jones and Simon Wessely have argued that the small sample size and the single location studied limit the validity of the validation study. Legacy and related work The principles and some of the methods devised for the CRUs were later adapted and applied to European civilian refugees displaced by war. CRUs represent one of the first controlled experiments in social psychology. The work conducted at the CRUs contributed to the development of the concept and methods of therapeutic communities. Many of the staff of No. 1 CRU had worked on WOSBs, and their collaborative work on these two schemes resulted in them coming together after the war to establish the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in 1947. The archives of the Tavistock Institute, which include extensive materials on the psychological principles behind and creation of the CRUs, have been catalogued and donated to the Wellcome Library where they can be ordered and viewed.

Her expertise on the position of women in the ancient world was recognised by the BBC History website, by whom she was asked to curate an educational resource on Roman women. Amy Richlin, currently professor of Classics at the University of California, Los Angeles, has cited Dixon as a great influence in shaping her own work on gender politics. Her 1992 monograph 'The Roman Family' is credited with being one of the key texts in the field. She is currently without an academic post, but continues writing about the ancient world in a freelance capacity, such as her contribution as Honorary Research Consultant to a chapter on Roman marriage in The Wiley Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds.

Elef Neshotav Shel Naftali Siman-Tov, literally \\"Naftali Siman-Tov's Thousand Wives\\") is a 1989 Israeli independent underground dramatic-historical art film directed by Michal Bat-Adam. Synopsis In the Bukharim quarter, Jerusalem, during the 1920s, merchant Naftali Siman-Tov () is a wealthy middle-aged widower, all of whose previous wives have died under mysterious circumstances. He fears getting married again due to believing that he is cursed. A local matchmaker, Arotchas (), with the help of some old ladies, pressures him to get married again nonetheless, and, eventually, he marries Flora (Rita Jahanforuz), a na√Øve 24-year-old virgin. However, in order not to bestow his alleged curse upon her, he avoids all physical touch. Flora gets pregnant as a result of sleeping with a local textile salesman, Hamedian (), and, Naftali, unable to bear the shame, becomes violent toward his young wife. Reception Writing in Haaretz, critic opined that Rita Jahanforuz \\"adds to this film a significant amount of humanity and humor, and, she has a natural filmic presence,\\" while Yedioth Ahronoth critic wrote that the film presents \\"a cornucopia of beautiful colors, [showing] a Jerusalem of towels, handsome tools, and, scarfs, really a wonderful parade of lots of tradition, customs, and, folklore, representing all Twelve Tribes of Israel, as if it were a beautiful exhibition by Maskit, with a well-spoken text,\\" Davar critic noted that the film's main achievement is its treatment of color and light, namely, that the cinematography \\"creates an almost perfect match between the view that can be seen through the vast Jerusalemite windows (in which the characters walk) and the large rooms within the old tastefully and colorfully decorated stone-made houses,\\" and Al HaMishmar critic underscored that the film is Michal Bat-Adam's \\"best and most wholesome film\\" to date, due to its \\"reliable and reserved cinematic language creating a correct historical environment and utilizing glowing and careful acting.\\" References External links A Thousand and One Wives at the TCM Movie Database 1980s historical drama films 1989 independent films 1989 films Adultery in films Films about businesspeople Films about old age Films about widowhood Films based on short fiction Films directed by Michal Bat- Adam Films set in the 1920s Films set in Jerusalem Films shot in Israel Hebrew-language films Israeli drama films Israeli films Israeli historical films Israeli independent films Pregnancy films Women and death 1989 drama films ","title":"A Thousand and One Wives"},{"id":"53565344","text":"Knut Sven-Erik Magnusson (13 October 1942 ‚Äì 22 March 2017) was a Swedish singer and musician known for being the lead singer of the band Sven-Ingvars that during their sixty-year history played many different types of popular music, and was at times regarded as a dansband.

It exhibits architectural and historic changes from the early 1700s into the 20th century. It is roughly bounded by Main, Warren, North, Woodbury, Woodruff, and Academy Hill Roads, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The area that is now Watertown was settled in the early 18th century, but was not incorporated as a separate town until 1780. Its town green, extending north- south between United States Route 6 and Woodbury Road, was laid out in 1772, and a colonial meetinghouse built at its edge (where the present town hall now stands), the area began to take shape as a village center. Steele Brooke, which flows east of the village, was developed as a modest industrial area in the 19th century, and the village was eventually populated with shops and several churches. The houses and institutional buildings built in the village before about 1930 represent an unusually high level of quality and diversity of style, and include a significant number of architect-designed buildings. The historic district covers about , and is roughly centered on the town green and a stretch of US 6 between Woodbury Road and Main Street. At its eastern edge, Main Street, it abuts part of the town's modern central business district. Its southern boundary is Woodbury Road and Academy Hill Road, extending further south on Woodruff Road almost to Scott Avenue. It extends northward along Main and North Streets to include Warren Street. The green includes several small war memorials and a gazebo. The typical streetscape in the district is residential, with stylistically diverse buildings of high quality. Important non-residential buildings including the 1839 Greek Revival Congregational Church, and the Richardsonian Romanesque former library, built in 1883. The present town hall, built in 1894 in brick, is a fine example of Colonial Revival architecture.

Background  Wu Cheng was born in 893, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. He was from Shanyin (Â±±Èô∞, in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang). His grandfather Wu Kexin () was a county magistrate during Tang, and his father Wu Yue () passed the Tang imperial examinations in the Jinshi class during Emperor Zhaozong's Dashun era (890-891). After passing the imperial examinations, Wu Yue was made the secretary general of Zhendong Circuit (ÈéÆÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing), then under the control of the warlord Qian Liu.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 87.As Wu Yue's commission as secretary general was mentioned specifically to be \\"of Zhendong,\\" rather than of Zhendong's former name Weisheng, this implied that his commission was after the renaming in 896, by which time Zhendong was under Qian Liu's control. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260.  During Qian Liu's reign  In 907, the Tang throne was seized by the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong, who established a new state of Later Liang as its emperor.

Toward the end of Qian's Baozheng era (926-931), Qian was trying to find an appropriate husband for one of his daughters. He summoned Wu, along with two other sons of prominent officials, Meng Can () and Yu Bao (), to his presence. He examined the three of them, particularly Wu, and then chose Wu to be his daughter's husband. He bestowed (in the emperor's authority) the title of Jinbu Langzhong () on Wu. As he considered Wu capable in administrative matters, he put Wu in charge of overseeing the paperwork from various departments of his government.  During Qian Yuanguan's reign  After Qian Liu died in 932 and was succeeded by his son Qian Yuanguan (King Wenmu),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Qian Yuanguan bestowed (in the emperor's authority) the title of Zhifang Langzhong () on Wu Cheng, and made Wu his assistant in both of his roles as governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) and military governor (Jiedushi). Later, during the Tianfu era (used by two of Qian Yuanguan's suzerains ‚Äî Shi Jingtang and Shi Chonggui the emperors of Later Jin) (936-947), Qian Yuanguan made one of his sons, Qian Hongxuan (), the prefect of Mu Prefecture (Áù¶Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), but did not actually send Qian Hongxuan to Mu; instead, he made Wu the acting prefect, being actually in charge there.  During the reigns of the last three kings  It is not clear what role Wu Cheng served in during the subsequent reign of Qian Yuanguan's son Qian Hongzuo (King Zhongxian) (r. 941-947). During the subsequent reign of Qian Hongzuo's younger brother Qian Hongzong (King Zhongxun) (947), Qian Hongzong made Wu in charge of the western headquarters (i.e., Zhenhai Circuit (), headquartered at Wuyue's capital Qiantang (Èå¢Â°ò, in modern Hangzhou)), and shortly after made him a chancellor. Shortly after, when the warlord Li Ruyun, who had actual control of Weiwu Circuit (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) but was a Wuyue vassal, tried to turn against Wuyue, the Wuyue general stationed at Weiwu's capital Fu Prefecture (), Bao Xiurang (), assassinated him and took control of the circuit on Wuyue's behalf. Qian Hongzong thereafter sent Wu to Weiwu to take over as acting military governor,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. and apparently thereafter made him full military governor. In 950, Cha Wenhui (), a general of Wuyue's western neighbor Southern Tang who was serving as Southern Tang's acting military governor of Yong'an Circuit (Ê∞∏ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Nanping, Fujian), mistakenly believed that Wuyue had abandoned Fu Prefecture and that he could take it over. Cha therefore took his army and headed toward Fu. Hearing that Cha was approaching, Wu decided to mislead him by sending soldiers out of the city to welcome Cha. Cha thereafter entered the city and fell into an ambush set by Wu, and was captured. Wu delivered Cha to Qiantang, where Qian Hongzuo's younger brother and successor Qian Hongchu (King Zhongyi) presented him to the Wuyue royal ancestral temple but then released him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. Later, Qian Hongchu recalled Wu to Qiantang and again made him chancellor, serving alongside Yuan Dezhao. In 956, when Southern Tang's northern neighbor Later Zhou, to which Wuyue was a vassal, launched a major attack on Southern Tang, Qian Hongchu launched his army and stationed it on the border with Southern Tang, waiting for orders from the Later Zhou emperor Guo Rong on whether to attack Southern Tang. The army officer Chen Man () argued to Wu that Southern Tang was in shock over the Later Zhou invasion and that its important city Chang Prefecture (Â∏∏Â∑û, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) would be defenseless and could easily be taken; subsequently, Chen falsely informed Wu that the Later Zhou emperor had already ordered Wuyue to attack. Wu advocated to Qian that Wuyue launch an attack. Yuan opposed, however, stating to Qian Hongchu: \\"Tang is a large state, and we cannot take it lightly. If we enter Tang territory and Zhou forces do not arrive, we would be with no other allies, and we would be in danger. Please wait.\\" Qian Hongchu, however, ultimately listened to Wu, and put him in charge of the operations, with Bao and Luo Sheng () serving under Wu. Wu told the soldiers, \\"Chancellor Yuan does not want to launch the attack.\\" The soldiers became angry and tried to attack Yuan. Qian Hongchu hid Yuan in his palace and ordered that those advocating assaulting Yuan be arrested, while sighing, \\"Just as the army is launched, the soldiers want to attack the chancellor. This is a sign of misfortune.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292. Wu's attack on Chang was initially successful, as the outer city fell. The Southern Tang military prefect of Chang, Zhao Renze (), was captured by Wuyue forces and delivered to Qiantang. However, Wu, who had previous disputes with Bao and Luo, humiliated them, causing them to be displeased. Meanwhile, the Southern Tang general Chai Kehong () arrived at Chang, but, hiding most of his troops, claimed to be merely there to escort the Southern Tang emissary Qiao Kuangshun (), whom Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing had previously sent to Wuyue, back to Southern Tang. Wu did not appreciate the risk and took no precautions. When Chai then launched a surprise attack on the Wuyue camp, Luo did not engage fully and allowed the Southern Tang army to head toward Wu's headquarters. Wu barely escaped the attack, but the Wuyue forces were routed. When Wu returned to Qiantang, Qian Hongchu stripped him of his offices.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 293. Wu Cheng died in 965,Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 81. at the age of 72. At his death, Qian Hongchu (whose name had been changed to Qian Chu by that point) restored his titles and gave him the posthumous name of Zhonglie (Âø†ÁÉà, \\"faithful and achieving\\").

Êù≠Áî¨ÈÅãÊ≤≥ (Hangyong Canal)) is located in Zhejiang province, China. Its west end is in Xixing Street, Binjiang District, Hangzhou City, crossing Cao'e River and Shaoxing City to its east end, the Yong River estuary in Ningbo City. The canal is long. Early canal construction took place in the Shanyin old canal in Shaoxing City, in the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC). In the third century AD, an official named He Xun supervised the construction of Xixing Canal, establishing the complete Eastern Zhejiang Canal. In the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), the capital was established at Linan, which meant that the Eastern Zhejiang Canal became an important shipping channel. From the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) to the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912), the Eastern Zhejiang Canal lost its privilege but still remained navigable. In recent years, because of newer modes of transportation, the canal has been gradually replaced. The reconstruction of the canal began in 2002, by 2007 it was partially navigable, and the renovation project finished in 2009, though the Ningbo section was not navigable until the end of 2013. Because the southern terrain in Eastern Zhejiang area is higher than the northern part and most rivers are north- south, the east-west route of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal cuts across several natural rivers. Numerous water locks and dams were built to allow watercraft to change levels from rivers to the canal and back. The locks and dams, along with many various types of bridges, developed into one feature of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal, and as a whole they are important heritage sites. In May 2013, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was listed in the seventh group of Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level, and was included in the Grand Canal. In November 2008, as an extension of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and the passage between the Grand Canal and the Maritime Silk Road, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was placed into the nomination file in the UNESCO World Heritage programme. In 2014, with Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and Sui & Tang Grand Canal, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal became one World Heritage site.  Layout  The west end of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal is Xixing Street, Binjiang District, Hangzhou City. After passing Xixing, entering Xiaoshan District, following by Qianqing town, Keqiao District, the canal crosses the old Qianqing River. The canal then goes southeast, entering Yuecheng District and lies across Cao'e River. The section ranging from Xixing to Cao'e is also known as ‚ÄúShao Shao Canal‚Äù. After passing the Cao'e River, the canal enters Shangyu District, and diverges to two branches. From Shangyantou, east side of Cao'e River, to Caoshu Bridge in Yuyao City, the northern branch (a.k.a. Yuyu Canal) connects Yao River. From Cao'e River to Tongming Dam, the southern branch (a.k.a. Forty Mile River) flows into Yao River and runs parallel to Houxin River and Shibali River. The main stem of the canal then enters the natural river. The tributary developed in Zhangting town is named Ci River, and the branch formed in Gaoqiao Town, Ningbo City is called Xitang River. After passing Yao River and Fenghua River, the two tributaries meet at Sanjiangkou area, Ningbo City and create the Yong River. The confluence flows into the East China Sea from the east side of Zhaobaoshan area in Zhenhai District. From west to east, Ci River divides at the south side of Ci City (this section is known as Shazi Port), connecting Yao River at Xiaoxi Dam. After passing Huazi Gate, the Ci River is called Zhongda River, and enters Zhenhai District from Jiangbei District, finally flowing into the Yong River. The Xitang river travels eastward to Wangjing Gate in Ningbo old town, meeting the moat and water system in the old town, and links to Fenghua River. The design of the parallel inner and outer tributaries is meant to avoid the influence of tides from the outer tributary, and causes the flow to abandon the meander and to continue straight downslope.  History  Because of the abundant precipitation in Eastern Zhejiang Area, canal construction was relatively easy, though there are few records regarding the process of construction. The history of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal can be traced back to Shanyin old canal in Autumn and Spring period. According to the history book Yuejue, the construction of Shanyin old canal originated with Fan Li while he was supervising the reconstruction of Dongguo Gate of Shanyin City (roughly the Shaoxing old town now). From Dongguo Gate to Liantang Town, Dongguan Street, Shangyu District, Shanyin old canal is in length. During the reign of Emperor Hui of Jin dynasty (AD 290-301), due to the need for irrigation, the official He Xun supervised the construction of Xixing Canal, from Xixing, the east shore of Qiantang River to Kuaiji City. From then on, this canal section, along with the channels east to Shangyu District, the natural waterways of Yao River and Yong River, constituted the Eastern Zhejiang Canal. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, under governmental and private management, the operation of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was shaped. In mid-Tang Dynasty, because of the busy traffic along Jiangnan Canal, local officials of eastern Zhejiang were appointed to dredge the canal, increase water locks and dams, dig new waterways and dredge Jian Lake. Jian Lake thus became one important source of water to the canal. The capital of the Southern Song Dynasty was Linan. Because of the conflicts between Jurchen Jin and Chinese Song, the northern part of Beijing Hangzhou Grand Canal disconnected from Jiangnan, and Eastern Zhejiang Canal and Jiangnan Canal became vital to Southern Song people. Additionally, because the Southern Song people thought highly of overseas trading, and Qingyuan Prefecture (now Ningbo) was an important port for international trades, the government particularly paid attention to the maintenance of the canal. In the early years of the Southern Song Dynasty, Emperor Gaozong (Zhao Gou) recruited laborers to reconstruct the Shaoxing and Yuyao sections. During the Southern Song Dynasty, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was restored several times, and its navigability was improved. According to Jiatai Kuaiji records, at that time the two canal sections in Xiaoshan County and Shangyu County could carry 200 vessels; the two canal sections in Shanyin County and Yao River could carry 500 vessels. At that time, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was at its acme in respect of navigability and prosperity. During the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, the governmental repair works and preservation of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal were still ongoing, which retained its navigability, though it was not as prosperous as in the Southern Song Dynasty. In the Ming Dynasty, the natural environment in the Eastern Zhejiang changed. Qianqing River, previously an obstruction to the Eastern Zhejiang Canal, was blocked, and its north and south weirs were dismantled so there was no obstruction to the channel between Xiaoshan and Cao'e. With the construction of seawalls and the formation of tidal flats in Zhejiang, a water system with lakes densely covering the regions along the canal was developed. In the Qing Dynasty, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal gradually lessened in importance; many courier stations along the canal were removed or combined with other stations. According to the records of Huang Zongxi, there were only dozens of larger-scale vessels serving the Eastern Zhejiang Canal in Qing Dynasty, not comparable to the hundreds of vessels in the Southern Song Dynasty. Particularly in the late Qing Dynasty, with the emergence of steamships and the Xiaoshan-Ningbo Railway, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was gradually replaced. After the Communist Party of China was founded, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was renovated several times. The channels were dredged and new facilities were built to facilitate transportation and irrigation. At the end of the 20th century, due to the development of Ningbo port, the transportation cost increased, prompting the reconstruction of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal to be included on the political agenda. In 2009, the reconstruction of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal finished.  Functions of the Canal  The Eastern Zhejiang Canal mainly functioned in four ways throughout its history: shipping, irrigation, the Caoyun system and water stations. = Shipping = Relics of the Xixing Wharf Shipping has been an important function of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal. In ancient times, ships from Eastern Zhejiang always went to Hangzhou by way of the canal to avoid the fierce tide of Hangzhou Bay (Êù≠Â∑ûÊπæ). During the Southern Song dynasty (1127Ôºç1279), the canal became a significant channel for foreign trade. Exported products like porcelain were transported to Ningbo first via the canal then would be shipped to foreign countries by the Silk Road. Meanwhile, products from Japan, Vietnam, Goryeo and other countries were also transported to the capital city Lin‚Äôan from the canal. Foreign envoys always landed in Ningbo, then travelled to Lin‚Äôan via the canal. In the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), Ningbo was the only port receiving Japanese tributary ships, the tribute then transported to the capital city by the canal. Besides official trades, shipping for civil use was also developed along the canal. At the end of the 1950s, short-distance shipping still thrived. The canal's shipping function was largely replaced by the 1980s with the improvement of road conditions. = Irrigation = Irrigating cultivated land on both sides of the canal was another crucial function of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal. The Xixing Canal, which was built by the Western Jin dynasty (265-316), was mainly used for irrigation. During the Southern dynasties (420-589), four yandai structures (a kind of earth dam used for raising upstream water level to benefit shipping or irrigation in ancient China) were constructed. In the tenth year of Yuanhe of the Tang dynasty (815), canals in Jiangnan () area were repaired. From this, the water storage and drainage functions of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal improved. From the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) to the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the water storage and drainage facilities of the canal's river network went through repair each period. This largely completed the canal's gate dam control system. = Caoyun system = Eastern Zhejiang was important in collecting and transporting tribute grain, and the canal had a significant role in this process. In the Tang dynasty, canal facilities began to be controlled by officials; tribute grain was first shipped to Xixing via the canal, then sent by the Qiantang River to finally arrive in the capital city by way of the Beijing - Hangzhou Grand Canal. During the Southern Song dynasty (1127Ôºç1279), substantial goods and materials from the eastern Zhejiang area like salt and rice together with the tribute grain from Fujian Province (which arrived by sea transport) were shipped to Lin‚Äôan via the canal. Later, during the Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368), tribute grain started to be shipped in a co- operative sea-river joint transportation method. The institution which managed the sea transportation of tribute grain was established, and the tribute grain which was transported by the canal would be shipped by sea after it arrived at Ningbo (called Qingyuan at that time) Port. Until the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), the Caoyun system of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was still comparatively developed. During the reign of Xianfeng emperor in the Qing dynasty, once again, it was decreed that tribute grain was to be transported by sea and the canal started to lose its function in the Caoyun system. = Postal service = The Eastern Zhejiang Canal served as an important postal route. At the base of the canal there was a station called the Xixing Post. Official documents were sent to Shaoxing, Ningbo and Taizhou by post via the canal. The postal system was also responsible for service via delivery stores. In the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), 12 post houses were put up along the canal; these were reduced in number later in the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). After the twentieth year of Qianlong of the Qing dynasty, the Xixing Post was kept while setting up posts in other counties. In the thirty-second year of the reign of the Guangxu emperor, modern Chinese post was established and delivery stores abolished. In the third year of his reign, emperor Xuantong abdicated causing all post houses to close while certain post functions of the canal remained till the popularization of railways and roads. Scholars such as Chen Qiaoyi, a professor from Zhejiang University, think the Eastern Zhejiang Canal should be included as part of ‚Äòthe Grand Canal of China‚Äô.  Important Remains  Along the Eastern Zhejiang Canal, you can find substantial cultural relics, including 3 national-level, nearly 20 provincial-level plus a number of city- level and county-level historical and cultural sites under protection. These are mainly water conservancy facilities, bridges and other utilities. Additionally, some ancient towns which are influenced by the canal also reside along both sides of the canal. = Water conservancy facilities = The relic of the Yongxing Gate The bottom barrage of the old Cao'e Barrage The Eastern Zhejiang Canal is made up of many natural rivers. To maintain the stable water levels and benefit agriculture along the banks, numerous water conservancy facilities were constructed along the canal. These are primarily composed of barrages, dams and gates. Among these, significant ones can be found on the central canal and tributaries of the canal such as the Yongxing Gate (located in Xiaoshan District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province), the Caoe Barrage, the Lianghu Barrage, the Tongming Barrage, the Qingshui Gate (all located in Shangyu District, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province), Doumen Gate, the Yunlou Xiaba Dam (both located in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province) and the Xidu Barrage (located in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province). * The Yongxing Gate, which is also called the Longkou Gate, is located in Xixing. In the past, it was ten li (a Chinese unit of length, one li = 1/2 kilometre) away from Xiaoshan County and served as the western starting point of the canal. It used to be a barrage, which was then transformed into a gate in the fifteenth year during the reign of Wanli emperor to resist the tides from the Qiantang River (). You can still see its remains today. * The Caoe Barrage lies on the west bank of the Caoe River. In ancient times, it was 90 li away from Shaoxing city and used to be a gate while it functions as a barrage nowadays. A ship lift now operates on the barrage. * The Lianghu Barrage, which lies on the east bank of the Caoe River, used to connect the Caoe River and the Sishili River. It moved multiple times in history and the current location is in Wailianghu Village, Lianghu Town. Due to the reconstruction of the canal, this barrage is not in use any more. * The Tongming Barrage is located in Fenghui Town, Shangyu District, Shaoxing. There are two barrages near it, named the North Barrage and the South Barrage respectively. * The Qingshui Barrage is located in Haoba town, Shangyu District, Shaoxing. During the period of Jiatai in the Southern Song dynasty, the Qingshui Sluice Gate was built, with a sluice gate beneath. Since then, it was reconstructed during every dynasty. * The Doumen Barrage is located in Yuyao. Its history can be seen in record from the Southern Song dynasty. Its old barrage still remains today but is of no use. In 1983, the ship lift was installed. Its history is a reflection of the continual evolution of the canal's water conservancy facilities. * The Xiaba Dam is located in Yuyao and is also named Dajiangkou Dam. It was 40 li away from Yuyao county in ancient times and was a necessary route to take from Ningbo to Shaoxing, connecting the Shibali River and the Yao River. Its remains still exist today and a ship lift was built later. * The Barrage also called the Daxi Dam, which is located in Haishu District, Ningbo. It was originally built in the Song dynasty while the current construction was built during the period of Zhengtong in the Ming dynasty. As a connection of the Yao River and the Xitang River, it served as an important path from Mingzhou to the capital in ancient times. It has been preserved well. Currently, these constructions are included in the sixth batch of historical and cultural sites protected at the provincial level in Zhejiang Provence under the following projects ‚Äì The Water Conservancy and Shipping Facilities of the Qiantang River and Canal Ports, The Water Conservancy, Shipping and Service Facilities of the Caoe River's Ports, Relic Sites Group of the Tongming Barrage, The Water Conservancy and Shipping Facilities from Yiting to Wufu, The Qingshui Gate and Management Facilities, The Water Conservancy and Shipping Facilities of the Yao river and Relevant Heritage Groups etc. = Ancient towpaths = A towpath is the road that canal boat trackers walk along as they towed boats. There are many towpaths located in different reaches while mainly converge in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. These ancient towpaths were originally built in the tenth year of Yuanhe in the Tang dynasty (815). They cover nearly one hundred li in total. Especially the towpath which connects the Qianqing Slab Bridge and the Shangxie Bridge, with a length of 7.5 kilometers, is well preserved. These towpaths are either against the canal bank on one side or surrounded by the canal on both sides. The latter form can be divided into entity towpath and stone pier towpath styles. You can always see bridges located after certain distances as they help ships pass through safely. These are well known as the White-Jade-liked Long Embankment. Currently, the towpath, located in Shaoxing, connecting the slab bridge in Qingqian Town and the Shangxie Bridge in Keqiao Street, is recognized as a major historical and cultural site protected at the national level. Additionally, the Xiaoshan Towpath, the Yuhou Bridge Towpath (located in Shaoxing), the Gaobu Towpath (located in Shaoxing) and the towpath in Shangyu are protected as historical and cultural sites at the provincial level in Zhejiang Province. = Ancient bridges = The Tongji Bridge of Yuyao Numerous ancient bridges stand across the Eastern Zhejiang Canal with various bridge forms, including semicircular arch, seven-polygonal arch, U-shaped arch, overpass and other forms. Many bridges are now protected as historical and cultural sites. Among these bridges, under the name of Ancient Bridge Groups of Shaoxing, some bridges of this city are protected as key historical and cultural sites at national level. * The Bazi Bridge is located in Yuecheng District, Shaoxing. It was originally constructed in the Southern Song dynasty and the bridge was reinforced in 1982. It stands across three water courses with two slopes on both sides. * The Taiping Bridge is located in Shaoxing. Its construction was first started in the forty ‚Äì eighth year during the reign of the Wanli emperor and was reconstructed in the eighth year during the reign of the Xianfeng emperor. It is a combination of single-span bridge and eight- span stone beam bridge design. You can see gallery roads beneath the bridge. Its construction form is viewed as representative of early overpasses in ancient China. * The Guangning Bridge is located in Shaoxing, which was originally constructed in the Northern Song dynasty and reconstructed during the reign of Wanli in the Ming dynasty. It is the longest single-span seven- polygonal arch in Shaoxing. * The Jingkou Bridge is located in Keqiao District, Shaoxing. It is a combination of three-span U-shaped arch bridge and three-span stone beam bridge design. The current bridge was reconstructed during the reign of the Xuantong emperor in the Qing dynasty. * The Tongji Bridge is located in Yuyao, the current bridge was reconstructed during the reign of the Yongzheng emperor in the Qing dynasty. It is a stone arch bridge which is made up of two piers and three spans and became famous because of its big central/main span. People used to call it the Most Prominent Bridge of Eastern Zhejiang. = Ancient towns = The Xixing Ancient Town which located along the canal The Eastern Zhejiang Canal deeply influences many cities and towns on both its sides. Cities that it passed by included Xiaoshan, Shanyin, Kuaiji, Shangyu (refer to old maps), Yuyao, Cixi (refer to old maps) and Ningbo. Most of them used to install water gates to give convenience to the incoming and outgoing of ships. With the development of modern cities, most of these cities or towns have undergone drastic changes. However, some ancient towns still exist until day due to insufficient re-development. * The Xixing Ancient Town is the western starting point of the canal and its appearance was mainly finalized in the Ming dynasty. Many people ran a special business called Guotangxing, it was a canal transportation business that only existed in Zhejiang Province. * The Cicheng Ancient County used to be the county of Cixi, Ningbo. It was originally constructed in the twenty-sixth year of Kaiyuan in the Tang dynasty. It shows people the typical county construction style of the Jiangnan area (Jiangnan means area of the southern side of the Yangtze River while currently it refers to the area between the southern side of the Yangtze River and the northern side of the Qiantang River, namely an area covering Jiangsu Province, Shanghai, Zhejiang Province). = Other relics = * The Xixing Guotangxing is a kind of transit business of both people and goods in Xixing. It appeared during the reign of Wanli in the Ming dynasty and reached the most prosperous time from the end of the Qing dynasty to the beginning of the Republic of China (1912-1949). At its peak, the business had 72.5 stores, while it declined during the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 ‚Äì September 9, 1945). Currently, partial constructions used in this old type business are protected as historical and cultural sites at a provincial level in Zhejiang Province. * The Jian Lake is located in Shaoxing, which was originally excavated in the Han dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD) and undertook the important function of restoring water and controlling flood. After the Southern Song dynasty, due to cultivation, the size of the lake gradually shrank, its functions thus lost. * The Shuize Stone Tablet of the Pingqiao River is located in Ningbo which was constructed in the Ming dynasty. The tablet used to be underwater with a Chinese character ‚ÄòÂπ≥‚Äô (which means flat and peaceful in Chinese) carved in it and serve as an observation facility of water level.  Cultural influence  In the Chinese legend the Butterfly Lovers, the protagonist Liang Shanbo looked for Zhu Yingtai along the Eastern Zhejiang Canal. More than forty famous poets from the Tang dynasty had visited the west part of the canal, including Li Bai (701‚Äì762), Du Fu (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Tu Fu; Chinese: ÊùúÁî´; 712 ‚Äì 770), He Zhizhang (simplified Chinese: Ë¥∫Áü•Á´†; traditional Chinese: Ë≥ÄÁü•Á´†; pinyin: H√® Zhƒ´zhƒÅng; Wade‚ÄìGiles: He Chih-chang, ca. 659‚Äì744)), Wang Wei (Chinese: ÁéãÁ∂≠; 699‚Äì759) etc. Thus, the canal constitutes A Road of Tang Poetry in the Eastern Zhejiang along with the Cao'e River (Chinese: ÊõπÂ®•Ê±ü; pinyin: C√°o'√© JiƒÅng), the Shanxi Creek, Tianlao Mountain, Tiantai Mountain etc. After the Tang dynasty, many famous men of letters have since passed the canal, including Lu You (simplified Chinese: ÈôÜÊ∏∏; traditional Chinese: Èô∏Ê∏∏/Èô∏ÈÅä; 1125‚Äì1209), Fan Chengda (Chinese: ËåÉÊàêÂ§ß; pinyin: F√†n Ch√©ngd√†; Wade‚ÄìGiles: Fan Ch'engta, 1126‚Äì1193), Qin Guan (simplified Chinese: Áß¶ËßÇ; traditional Chinese: Áß¶ËßÄ; 1049 ‚Äì c. 1100), Zhu Yizun (Chinese: Êú±ÂΩùÂ∞ä; pinyin: Zh≈´ Y√≠z≈´n; Wade‚ÄìGiles: Chu I-tsun; 1629‚Äì1709), Lu Xun (formerly also romanized Lu Hs√ºn, was the pen name of Zhou Shuren, 25 September 1881 ‚Äì 19 October 1936) etc., a number of great works were created and left till now. In the year of 1488, because of heavy storms, the Korean official Choe Bu (1454‚Äì1504) drifted to Taizhou, China. Later, he went to Hangzhou from Ningbo via the canal and came back to Korea from Beijing by way of the Beijing - Hangzhou Grand Canal. He wrote a book named the Geumnam pyohaerok (traditional Chinese: Èå¶ÂçóÊºÇÊµ∑ÈåÑ; ; Korean: Í∏àÎÇ®ÌëúÌï¥Î°ù; literally: \\"A Record of Drifting Across the Southern Brocade Sea\\") to record his journey. This book provides an important account of the Ming dynasty for historians.  Contemporary development  In 2007, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) of the Government of the People's Republic of China enacted a document named The National Inland Waterway and Port Layout Plan. In this document, the canal composing of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal and the Beijing - Hangzhou Grand Canal was recognized as the most important waterway in the Yangtze River Delta. The proposal of reconstructing the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was raised in 1983. Back to then, after partial construction, the navigation capacity remained 40 tons. In 2002, to manage problems including too many barrages on the canal and the low navigation tonnage which would not satisfy the demand of modern logistics, the reconstruction project of the canal began. This project set grade four waterways (which can navigate 500-ton freighters) as the standard and took the Sanbo Navigation Lock which located on the west bank of the Qiantang River as its starting point. The canal would flow through the Qiantang River, the Puyang River, the Xixiao River, the Cao‚Äôe River, the Sishili River, the Yao River and the Yong River and would finally empty into the East China Sea in the mouth of the Yong River. More than 130 bridges and 8 navigation blocks were constructed in this project. Some reconstructions were also completed along the canal, including railways, roads, constructions which would be affected by this project and aids for navigation. By September 2009, this project was completed. It turned out to be the single inland waterway reconstruction project with the biggest investment scale in the history of mainland China. Before the completion, in December 2007, partial canal had been put into use, especially the part in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, which had already become the busiest waterway. However, in Ningbo, due to bridges across the Yao River not satisfying the demand of navigation, large investments needed to be put into reconstruction. The uncompleted canal of Ningbo used to attract attention from the media in Chinese mainland.  World Heritage  In 2006, the Beijing - Hangzhou Grand Canal started to apply to be classified as a World Heritage Site. At the very beginning, only the Canal of the Sui and Tang dynasties and the Canal of Ming and the Qing dynasties were included in the plan. With the appeal of relevant experts and media, in November 2008, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was brought into this application. Shan Jixiang, the director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage back then, used to comment on this alteration as, the join of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal made the Beijing - Hangzhou Grand Canal connect to the maritime silk road. The starting point of the Canal of the Sui and Tang dynasties ‚Äì Luoyang, is also the starting point of the land silk road. All these would form ‚Äòa remarkable and inevitable integration which is made up of culture, commodity and information and a big circle‚Äô. In 2004, in the 38th time of the World Heritage Committee conference, which was held in Doha, the Beijing ‚Äì Hangzhou Grand Canal, which included the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was officially added into the Lists of World Heritage Sites. The world heritage sites which were listed include: * The Xiaoshao Canal, including Waterways of the Xiaoshao Canal, the Xixing wharf and relics of Guotangxing, the Bazi Bridge The community of the Bazi Bridge, the ancient towpaths of Shaoxing. * The Yuyu Canal * The Ningbo part of the Eastern Zhejiang Canal * The Mouth of the Three Rivers of Ningbo, including the East Zhejiang Maritime Affairs/Folk Custom Museum ()  References  Canals in China Transport in Zhejiang ","title":"Eastern Zhejiang Canal"},{"id":"53565607","text":"Live & Acoustic at the Palace is a live acoustic album by the Used to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the band.

Early life and education Born on 25 July 1873, she was the seventh child of Edward Bradby, who was a master at Harrow and headmaster of Haileybury College. In 1885, her father retired from Haileybury and moved to the new charitable settlement of Toynbee Hall in London's East End, with the family residing at St Katharine Docks ‚Äì a significant change from Barbara's rural upbringing but which she took in her stride. She was then sent to the progressive new boarding school of St Leonards in Scotland, which was pioneering academic education for girls. In 1892, she won a scholarship to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, following her sister Dorothy. She was the first woman student at Oxford to use a bicycle and was also head of the college's boat club, captain of the hockey team and a tennis champion. She further distinguished herself by being the first woman to take a double-first in Classical Moderations and Greats ‚Äì a set of examinations renowned for their difficulty. This feat inspired a limerick: ::In spite of long hours with a crammer, ::I never get more than a Gamma, ::But the girl over there ::With the flaming red hair ::Gets Alpha Plus every time, damn her! Marriage and writing At Oxford, she became a fellow of Lady Margaret Hall. There, she had met John Lawrence Hammond and they married in 1901 after he had established a career in political journalism, becoming the editor of the Liberal weekly review, The Speaker, in 1899. They lived in Battersea and were both active in campaigning against the Boer War. She was also active in the Women's Industrial Council until ovarian tuberculosis forced her to retire and also prevented her from having children. The couple moved to Hampstead Heath in 1905 for the sake of her health, which was now delicate. In 1907, John became secretary of the Civil Service Commission and this position gave him sufficient time to write books too. They worked together on these with Barbara focussing on the research while John concentrated on the writing. While she had done better academically at Oxford, she told her husband John that \\"she hated using her brains\\". He wrote that her strength was \\"putting great masses of fact & detail in order, seizing their significance & seeing how they should be set out.\\" Their first work together was a study of the effects of enclosure and the Industrial Revolution upon the working classes. When taken to the publishers, Longmans, this was found to be too long and so Barbara restructured the work into separate volumes. The first of these was The Village Labourer which was published in 1911. This was well- received and had an immediate political impact, informing Liberal policy produced by the Land Enquiry Committee of David Lloyd George ‚Äì a driver of the Liberal welfare reforms. In 1912, they moved again to a farmhouse called Oatfield in the rustic village of Piccotts End which was to be their home for most of their lives. Barbara would work here while tending the large garden and collection of animals. Their friend, the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, recounted her spartan, therapeutic lifestyle which emphasised fresh air ‚Äì open windows, long walks, riding and outdoor sleeping. She would make occasional trips to the Public Record Office for research while John spent more time in London for his job. During the Second World War, he worked at the Manchester Guardian and so they moved to Manchester for the duration but then returned to Piccotts End in 1945. John died there in 1949 and Barbara died later in 1961.

The club fields a team in both the Men's SBL (MSBL) and Women's SBL (WSBL). The club is a division of Rockingham Basketball and Recreation Association (RBRA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the region. The Flames play their home games at Mike Barnett Sports Complex. Club history =Twenty years of no success (1992‚Äì2011)= The Rockingham Flames made their debut in the State Basketball League (SBL) in 1992 in the form of a women's team, becoming the first club to introduce a women's program before a men's program. In 1994, a Rockingham Flames men's team entered the MSBL. Over their first 20 seasons in the SBL, neither the women or the men won a minor premiership or earned a grand final berth. Season 2008 marked the men's best regular season in their history, as they finished in second place with a 21‚Äì5 record. Season 2010 marked the women's best regular season, as they finished in second place with a 16‚Äì6 record. In contrast, the women went on to have their worst-ever season in 2011, when they finished last with a 2‚Äì20 record. =First grand final appearance (2012)= In 2012, the Flames welcomed back Kaye Tucker and Casey Haggar, the two most important players from their strong 2010 team. They also brought in American import centre Emma Cannon, who quickly proved herself to be one of the best imports in the league. The Flames finished the regular season in fourth place with a 15‚Äì7 record before reaching the WSBL Grand Final. It marked the first ever grand final appearance in the club's history. In the championship decider on 31 August at the WA Basketball Centre, Cannon (12 points, 10 rebounds) and Tucker (11 points, 11 rebounds) were unable to fire for the Flames, as the South West Slammers took out the title with an 85‚Äì48 win. =Sami Whitcomb / Cooper Land era (2013‚Äì2016)= 2013 season: Whitcomb MVP In 2013, the Flames acquired two imports that would become staples for the club over the ensuing four years. For the women, American guard Sami Whitcomb was signed, while for the men, American forward Cooper Land joined the Flames after his brother Taylor played for the Mandurah Magic in 2012. While the men missed the finals, the women finished in second place with a 16‚Äì6 record, with Whitcomb being named league MVP. 2014 season: WSBL champions; Land and Whitcomb MVPs In 2014, the men accompanied the women in the finals, with both teams earning post-season berths. The men had their second-best regular-season campaign in their history, finishing in second place with a 17‚Äì9 record behind the Land brothers‚ÄîTaylor joined Cooper at the Flames in 2014 after a two-year stint with Mandurah. The women had a blistering season in 2014, as they collected the club's first ever minor premiership with a first-place finish and a 20‚Äì2 record. While the men were ousted by the East Perth Eagles in the quarter-finals, the women went undefeated over the first two rounds of the finals to reach the WSBL Grand Final. In the championship decider on 29 August at the WA Basketball Centre, the Flames' one-two punch of Whitcomb and Darcee Garbin saw them beat the Lakeside Lightning 80‚Äì75 to claim their maiden WSBL championship. Whitcomb and Garbin were the two stars of the night for the Flames with Grand Final MVP Whitcomb hitting 20 first-half points on her way to 32 for the night to go with six rebounds and five steals on the back of shooting 11-of-21 from the field, and 6-of-11 from three-point territory. Garbin complemented Whitcomb well with 25 points and 10 rebounds, while captain Kaye Tucker retired as a champion in what was her 350th and last appearance in the league. At the end-of-season awards night, Whitcomb was named MVP of the WSBL for the second consecutive year, while Cooper Land was named MVP of the MSBL. 2015 season: WSBL champions; Whitcomb MVP In 2015, both teams returned to the finals and saw success, with Whitcomb and Cooper Land once again leading the way. After finishing fifth with a 15‚Äì11 record, the men advanced through to the semi-finals, where they lost in straight sets to the Joondalup Wolves. The women on the other hand finished as minor premiers for the second straight year, once again with a 20‚Äì2 record. They made their way through to their third WSBL Grand Final in four years after going undefeated over the first two rounds of the finals. The Flames met the Willetton Tigers in the championship decider, a team who finished second in the regular season with an identical 20‚Äì2 record‚ÄîRockingham only claimed the minor premiership courtesy of a one-point edge in their two head-to-head battles. Behind a 41-point effort from Whitcomb, the Flames claimed back-to- back titles with a 68‚Äì63 win over the Tigers. Whitcomb subsequently earned her second consecutive Grand Final MVP. At the end-of-season awards night, Whitcomb was named MVP of the WSBL for the third consecutive year. 2016 season: Land MVP In 2016, both Whitcomb and Cooper Land returned to the Flames for a fourth season. Behind a strong contingent of Whitcomb, Garbin, Ifunanya Ibekwe, Jacinta Bourne, Tarsha Fletcher, Ashlee Sidebottom, Talisia Bourne, Lizel Buckley, Amanda Pether and Ella Kennedy, the women entered the finals following another strong regular season, having finished in second position with an 18‚Äì4 record. However, their quest for a three-peat was denied after losing 2‚Äì1 to the Tigers in the semi-finals. Season 2016 saw the men finish in fifth place with a 17‚Äì9 record. They went on to lose to the Geraldton Buccaneers in the quarter-finals in straight sets despite Cooper Land scoring 72 points over the two games. At the end-of-season awards night, Land was named MVP of the MSBL for the second time in three years. Following the 2016 season, the Land brothers both parted ways with the Flames, as did Whitcomb. =Third WSBL championship (2019)= In 2019, the Flames women, led by Darcee Garbin, Maddie Allen, Christina Boag and Alex Ciabattoni, finished the regular season in seventh position with a 13‚Äì9 record before reaching the WSBL Grand Final after going undefeated over the first two rounds of the finals. In the grand final, the Flames were led by Allen's 17 points and 10 rebounds as they defeated the Warwick Senators 85‚Äì56 to win their third WSBL championship.

Life  Hanna Weber was born into a working class family in Horn, a small town in the countryside to the north of Paderborn. As a young woman she worked in domestic service and as an unskilled worker in Solingen and D√ºsseldorf. In 1911 she married her first husband, Walter Staubes. Hanna Staubes joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) in 1915. The decision of the party leadership to instigate what amounted to a parliamentary truce over voting to fund the war had been contentious within the party from the outset, and the intensity of internal dissent grew as the slaughter on the battle front and destitution on the home front intensified. In 1917 the party split, and Hanna Staubes was part of the dissident faction that now defected to the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). She was also a member of the pacifist Spartacus League, and as the USPD itself broke apart after the war she was part of the leftwing majority that joined the newly formed Communist Party: she was a co-founder of the local Solingen branch. She became the leader of the women's group for the party's Solingen sub-district team (\\"Unterbezirksleitung\\"), and in 1929 was elected to the city council. In 1930 she was elected a member of the Rheinland provincial parliament (\\"Provinziallandtag\\"). She was then elected, in April 1932, to the Prussian Parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), in which represented the D√ºsseldorf East electoral district, remaining a member till the abolition of democracy in 1933. Staubes was also, in 1931, a co-organiser of the \\"Red Rhine-Ruhr Congress of Working Women\\". Change of government in January 1933 turned out to be the prelude to a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was immediately blamed on \\"communists\\", and during the next few months the authorities detained large numbers of politically active people, concentrating especially on those who were or had been Communist Party members. Hanna Staubes was arrested in July 1933 and held in \\"investigative detention\\" in prison in D√ºsseldorf till April 1934, when she was transferred into \\"protective custody\\". During the next few months she was held in a succession of concentration camps. However, by the end of 1934 she had apparently been released, and was able to marry her second husband, Otto Rautenbach. She was re-arrested in August 1937 and imprisoned in D√ºsseldorf till October 1938. The end of the Second World War in May 1945 brought about the downfall of the Nazi dictatorship and Hanna Rautenbach was able to rejoin the Communist Party, working as a party official in Solingen and, from November 1945, in the city administration. It being not immediately possible to organise municipal elections the British forces administering this part of Germany initially sought to recreate the pre-Nazi parliamentary institutions allocating seats based on the last democratic elections, being those held in 1932. When regional elections were held on 10 April 1947 the Communist party received enough votes to give it 28 seats in the 216 seat regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\") in the newly configured state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and one of these went to Hanna Rautenbach. She remained a member till 1950. Following the blockade of West Berlin in 1949 and the uncompromising suppression of the East German uprising in 1953, cold war tensions between the two German states intensified, and in August 1956 the Communist Party of Germany was outlawed by the West Germany constitutional court.Eric D. Weitz, Creating German Communism, 1890-1990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997 Over the next decade, however, the relations between East and West Germany became less antagonistic, in 1968 a new version of the former party was launched as the German Communist Party ( \\"Deutsche Kommunistische Partei\\" / DKP), notionally as \\"an entirely new party\\".Helmut Bilstein u. a., Organisierter Kommunismus in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Opladen 1977, p. 16. Hanna Rautenbach was by now aged 79 and no longer politically or professionally active. Nevertheless, she lost no time in joining the \\"new\\" DKP. Hanna Staubes-Rautenbach died at Solingen on 27 August 1981.  Personal  Hanna Rautenbach's elder brother, Hermann Weber 1888 - 1937, also achieved notability as a Communist activist and, ultimately, as a victim of Stalin's purges.

The ecoregion is one of the most severely degraded of the Amazon region, suffering from large-scale deforestation and selective extraction of timber, particularly along the Trans-Amazonian Highway and in the higher and more populated southern portions. Location The Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia moist forests ecoregion has an area of . It lies to the south of the Amazon River in eastern Brazil. The Xingu River defines the western boundary and the Tocantins River defines the eastern boundary. To the south the ecoregion rises into the Caraj√°s Mountains, where it becomes interspersed with areas of seasonal forest and cerrado. Population centers include S√£o F√©lix do Xingu on the Xingu, Porto de Moz, Oeiras do Par√° and Gurup√° on the Amazon, and Marab√° on the Tocantins. The Maraj√≥ v√°rzea at the mouth of the Amazon lies to the north. To the west, on the other side of the Xingu River, is the Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests. To the northeast is the Tocantins/Pindare moist forests. To the southeast and south the ecoregion blends into the Mato Grosso seasonal forests ecoregion, and in some places directly adjoins the Cerrado ecoregion. Physical The terrain is undulating. In many areas the soils are rich, but in some parts they are low in nutrients. The north of the ecoregion is on the lowland Amazon basin, while in the south it rises into the higher ground of the Brazilian Shield. Elevations range from sea level at the Amazon to in the Caraj√°s Mountains in the south. The forest contains a network of blackwater rivers, stained dark with tannins and holding little suspended sediment. It contains the middle and lower basin of the Araguaia River, a tributary of the Tocantins. There are many smaller blackwater rivers including the Pacaj√° and Anapu tributaries of the Amazon River, the Bacaj√° and Fresco tributaries of the Xingu, and the Parauapebas and Catete tributaries of the Tocantins. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. Temperatures are fairly steady throughout the year, slightly higher in April and slightly lower in July. Average temperatures range from , with a mean of . The region is drier than the ecoregions further to the west. In the middle Xingu annual rainfall is . Elsewhere average annual precipitation is about Monthly precipitation ranges from in July to in March. =Flora= The diverse terrain results in diverse flora and fauna, particularly on the richer soils, with many endemic species. Most of the original vegetation is evergreen tropical rainforest on terra firme. In the north there is lowland Amazon forest up to high, graduating to dense submontane forest and then open submontane forest further south. There are fewer epiphytes and orchids in these forests than in the ecoregions further west. There are areas of liana forests on higher ground in the south and southeast and of forests dominated by baba√ßu palm (Attalea genus) and/or Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa). The stands of baba√ßu palms are thought to be originally planted by humans. The blackwater river banks are lined with white-sand igap√≥ flooded forests. In the south the ecoregion is broken up by areas of savanna woodlands from the cerrado biome of the Central Brazilian Plateau. The liana forests cover large areas of comparatively rich soil. They are more open than the humid terra firme forest, with a lower canopy of or less. They contain many huge lianas at all levels from the families Bignoniaceae, Fabaceae, Hippocrateaceae, Menispermaceae, Sapindaceae, and Malpighiaceae. They also hold large trees including Apuleia molaris, Bagassa guianensis, Caryocar villosum, Hymenaea parvifolia, Tetragastris altissima, Astronium graveolens, Astronium lecointei, Apuleia leiocarpa var. molaris, Sapium marmieri, Acacia polyphylla and Elizabetha. There are many endemic species such as Cenostigma tocantinum, Ziziphus itacaiunensis and Bauhinia bombaciflora. Typical trees in the middle Tocantins upland include Cenostigma tocantinum, Bombax tocantimumi, Bombax macrocalyx, Matisia bicolor, Strychnos melinoniana and Strychnos solimoesana. Swietenia macrophylla is found in the moist areas. =Fauna= Snake of genus Chironius in Caraj√°s There are 153 species of mammals, a relatively low number for the Amazon region. Of these 90 are bats and 21 are rodents. There are 8 species of primates including the white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), red-bellied titi (Callicebus moloch), Azara's night monkey (Aotus azarae infulatus) and white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus). The last two are endemic to this ecoregion and the Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests to the west. Other species of mammals include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), cougar (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), brocket deer (genus Mazama), bare-tailed woolly opossum (Caluromys philander), and seven-banded armadillo (Dasypus septemcinctus). Endangered mammals include white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 527 species of birds have been recorded including many species of egret, heron, hawk and falcon along the rivers and meadows. Other birds include Brigida's woodcreeper (Hylexetastes perrotii brigidai), hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), scarlet macaw (Ara macao), many parrots (genera Amazona and Pionus) and parakeets (genera Aratinga, Pyrrhura and Brotogeris'). Endangered birds include green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). The rivers are home to spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), yellow-spotted river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Caraj√°s Mine in the Caraj√°s Mountains Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion \\"Vulnerable\\". The Tapaj√≥s-Xingu, Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia and Tocantins/Pindare moist forests ecoregions on the eastern edge of the Amazon basin have all been badly affected by human settlement and deforestation. The Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia region is the most deforested and degraded part of the Amazon region after the adjoining Tocantins/Pindare moist forests to the east. It is crossed by the Trans- Amazonian Highway (BR-230) from east to west, and by the BR-422 highway along the Tocantins. Most of the land along these roads has been deforested and replaced by pasture or farm fields. The remaining forest has been stripped of its valuable trees, and many native fauna and flora have become locally extinct. Large-scale mining near Marab√° and elsewhere have directly affected the environment, and demand large quantities of wood to run the smelters. During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.94%. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall. Low, flat, deforested ecoregions such as the Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia moist forests are extremely vulnerable. Conservation units include the Tapirap√© Biological Reserve and Tapirap√©-Aquiri National Forest.

The team fielded the No. 66 Chevrolet Silverado for Jordan Anderson, Ross Chastain, Travis Kvapil, Trey Hutchens, Ken Schrader, Justin Fontaine, Jason Hathaway and Vinnie Miller.  Founding  Owner Jeff Bolen (a former amateur driver himself) had met driver Jordan Anderson in various levels of racing, including two Camping World Truck Series events in 2015. Bolen contacted Anderson in the 2015 off-season about forming a team together, and they unveiled the team, along with sponsor Columbia, South Carolina (Anderson's hometown), at Darlington Raceway on January 27, 2016.  Camping World Truck Series  = Truck No. 66 history = The team debuted in the 2016 NextEra Energy Resources 250 at Daytona International Speedway with Jordan Anderson behind the wheel. Due to rear gear problems, the team was dropped to 30th that race. The team continued with Anderson for most of the season, with a best finish of 11th at Gateway Motorsports Park, then the team substituted in drivers like Tim Viens, Ross Chastain, Josh Reeves, and Austin Wayne Self. The team led one lap in its first year (Anderson at Gateway), and finished 24th in owner points. Near the end of the 2016 offseason, Bolen Motorsports announced that Anderson would not pilot the No. 66 in 2017. Naming drivers on a week-to-week basis, the 66 truck was driven by Ross Chastain, who had run the Talladega Superspeedway race in 2016 for Bolen. After getting caught up in a large second-lap melee at Daytona, Chastain handed the team its first top ten finish, a tenth at Atlanta Motor Speedway driving an unsponsored truck. Chastain has tried to find a full-time driver for the truck after the Atlanta race. Unable to do so, Chastain again returned at Martinsville Speedway, this time with a special paint scheme from team owner Bolen's alma mater, the University of South Carolina, commemorating the school's success in both men's and women's basketball. After running Chastain in a number of companion events with the Xfinity Series, the team started a variable driver rotation based on lack of funding during crossover weekends, bringing in Travis Kvapil, Trey Hutchens, and Ken Schrader in to drive. However, when sponsorship dried up, the team abandoned its full-time schedule, instead running its next race in a partnership with AM Racing with its equipment and AM development driver Justin Fontaine behind the wheel. After that race, the only three possible races for the team in 2017 were upcoming events at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Martinsville Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway. Jason Hathaway, a regular NASCAR Pinty's Series competitor, drove the truck to a 15th place finish at Canada. The team added another race to its schedule when Vinnie Miller joined the team for the Talladega Superspeedway race. The team has not raced since 2017.

The act has been in force since January 1, 2014. Background The Parliament of Georgia passed The Economic Liberty Act (ELA) in December 2011. Unlike the initial draft, the final act (a constitutional amendment) contained a reservation which states that a separate Organic Law should define those cases in which the government will still be able to increase taxes without calling a referendum. The Economic Liberty Act is the Organic Law of Georgia and is based on the 4th and 5th parts of Article 94 of the Constitution of Georgia (Constitutional Law of Georgia No 4033 of July 1, 2011).https://matsne.gov.ge/ka/document/view/1168565http://www.parliament.ge/uploads/other/28/28803.pdf The act restricted the government from making changes to major economic policy without a popular referendum. It capped the government expenditures at 30% of the GDP, the debt to GDP ratio at 60%, and the budget deficit at 3% of the GDP. Some of these rules were known as the Maastricht criteria, enshrined in the EU Stability and Growth Pact and facilitating the smooth transition to the Eurozone. The act is intended to restrict the state‚Äôs ability to interfere in the affairs of the economy and grant power over tax changes to the people directly. While aiming at reducing the state expenses and debt by 30 and 60 percent respectively, it also explicitly prohibits the government from manipulating taxes without a popular referendum on rates and structure. Currently, the state budget is approximately 30% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and public debt is over 38% of the GDP.

The Lockheed L-188A Electra attempted takeoff from runway 6L but crashed near a residential area; the crash was caused by retracting the flaps at an altitude too low to clear the terrain after the propeller of engine number three feathered. All 45 people on board and one person on the ground perished in the crash. The investigation concluded that the pilot should have followed company policy by aborting takeoff in the event of an engine failure before reaching VR (takeoff) speed.\\"AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT REPORT AIR MANILA, INCORPORATED, LOCKHEED 1-188A REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES REGISTRY RP-C1061\\" (PDF). National Transportation Safety Board. September 26, 1977. NTSB/AAR-77-06. Retrieved March 22, 2017.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Lockheed L-188A Electra with four Allison 501-D13 engines, registered RP-C1061 to Air Manila International at the time of the accident. The aircraft made its maiden flight in 1958, then registered to Eastern Airlines as N5502. The aircraft was then sold to Air Manila on November 30, 1971. Maintenance records showed the transponder listed as \\"inoperable.\\" Engine No.2 to be shut down en route to Guam due to mechanical issues; several pilots reported issues with the No.3 engine in the maintenance log before the crash.  Crew  Twelve crew members were on board flight 702 when it crashed; four members of the flight crew, the loading master, two mechanics, and four flight attendants. The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain Roberto Javalera, 46, who worked for Air Manila since 16 September 1964, served as pilot in command on the flight. A veteran pilot, having logged 10,016 total flight hours, roughly 2,422:45 of which were accumulated flying Lockheed L-188A Electras. His license to operate Lockheed L-188A Electras was valid from March 1, 1976 to August 31, 1976. He was required to wear glasses for far-sightedness as needed in flight but this was not a factor in the crash. * First Officer Ernesto Nacion, 40, served as co-pilot, having worked for Air Manila since 17 April 1968. His pilot's license was valid from January, 1976, to 30 June 1976. Nacion was certified to be a reserve captain for the L-188 Electra on 10 March 1975. At the time of the accident he had 8,906:44 total flight hours, of which 2,037:21 were on the L-188 Electra. * Flight Engineer Johnathan Javalera (no relation to the captain), 32, who worked for Air Manila since 28 February 1969. * Relief Officer Salvador Bello, 33, who worked for Air Manila since 1 February 1970.  Synopsis  Air Manila flight 702 crashed while attempting to takeoff from runway 6L of Naval Air Station Agana at 14:47 Greenwich time on 4 June 1976. Seconds after lifting off from the runway the No. 3 propeller feathered. Witnesses reported that the plane lifted off the runway near the 7,500 marker of the 10,015 foot runway; also noting that despite the one feathered propeller the takeoff seemed normal. After the failure the plane flew at varying altitudes between 75 and 100 feet for a while, then flew level for 1,600 feet before crashing into terrain past the end of the runway; dragging across a hill, pushing through a chain link fence, and striking a car on the highway before stopping in a vacant space before exploding. All 45 people on board plus the driver of the car struck by the aircraft were killed. Two people who lived near the crash site suffered severe injuries from the explosion.  Causes  The primary cause of the accident was the flight crew's inappropriate response to the engine failure. The captain continued flight with the engine failure despite safely being able to abort takeoff, having not yet reached VR speed. The NTSB reported the causes of the accident as: References Aviation accidents and incidents in 1976 Aviation accidents and incidents in Guam 1976 in the Philippines Accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed L-188 Electra Aviation accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Airliner accidents and incidents caused by engine failure June 1976 events in Asia ","title":"Air Manila Flight 702"},{"id":"53566133","text":"Scythris nyikensis is a moth of the family Scythrididae.

It was published in Czech in 1996 by Nakladatelstv√≠ NLN (NLN Publishing), under the name Dej Mi Ty Prachy (Gimme the Money). It was later translated into English by Iva Pek√°rkov√° with help from her husband, Raymond Johnson, and published by Serpent's Tail through a grant from the Czech Ministry of Culture. Gimme the Money was also translated into German under the title, Taxi Blues, by Marcela Euler and subsequently published in 2000 by Malik Publishers. The novel is about a female Czechian taxi driver Jind≈ôi≈°ka, nicknamed Gin, and her life of navigating and finding a place in New York City and the taxi industry.  Plot  This novel begins with Gin and her roommate, Gloria, in their apartment. Readers learn that Gin makes her money from taxi driving and that she works at a garage under a Russian man named Alex who is constantly sexually harassing her. However, this does not seem to faze Gin, because this is what happened at the other garage where she worked under the dispatcher Kenny. Several days later, Gin picks up a passenger named Clyde. Clyde and Gin sleep together and Gin is interested in him, but the relationship is broken off when Gloria sleeps with him. Gin is so distraught that she contemplates suicide, but then destroys all of Gloria's paintings in the apartment. Because she no longer has a place to live, she moves in with Talibe, her husband from Mali. He and Gin do not get along very well because their different cultural upbringings clash. The only reason Gin married him was so that she could get a green card. Another day Gin is hanging out with a couple of other taxi drivers at a bar. One of these taxi drivers, Geoffrey, tells her that the only way for a taxi driver to make money is to cheat the customers by messing with the meter and using a book with fake prices. Ginny refuses because she does not want to get fined. Geoffrey and his friend, Sengane, talk about the times they have murdered some aggressive passenger while they were driving. While she is living with Talibe he asks her to marry his cousin, Ouagadougou, because Ouagadougou needs a green card. Gin initially refuses because she does not want to get in trouble with the authorities and risk deportation herself. However, she gives in because Talibe threatens to divorce her and marry someone else who will agree to marry as many of his family members as he needs. The day after her wedding with Ouagadougou, one of Talibe's friends calls Gin telling her that Talibe was shot while taxi driving. While Talibe is recovering in the hospital, he is distressed because he had a blood transfusion. In Mali culture, blood is very important, and Talibe is disgusted that the blood inside him is not his. He is also confused because he was shot while wearing his protective amulet, and he does not understand why the magic does not protect him. While Talibe could have gotten better, he died because his whole belief system crumbled. Once Talibe dies, Gin wants to find another place to live because she does not want to go back to their apartment. She goes to her old boss, Kenny, and asks if she can stay with him for a while, but he refuses because, unbeknownst to her, he has a wife and kids. Gin then returns to Gloria to ask to stay at her place, but when she returns to her old apartment and sees Gloria, she realizes that she is still not over the betrayal and runs back to Talibe's apartment. When she arrives at her apartment Ouagadougou is waiting for her. Because she is his wife, he argues, they should live together. Gin gives in, and Ouagadougou moves into the apartment with her. After Talibe's death Gin takes a couple of weeks off taxi-driving. When she returns to Alex's garage he has a brand-new fleet of taxis. She also visits Kenny, and he gives her a knife to protect herself while taxi driving. However, Gin feels less safe with the knife in her bag. One night when she was picking up customers, a passenger gets into her taxicab who gives Gin a bad vibe. He is not clear in his directions, but eventually they end up underneath Macombs Dam Bridge next to an abandoned part of Jackie Robinson Park. The passenger pulls a gun on her and starts telling her how he is going to kill her like he killed other people in that spot. While listening to his description of his last kill, Gin realizes that this is the man who killed her husband. When the man asks for her money, she hands it to him through the partition and cuts him with the knife that Kenny gave her. The man pulls his hand back and his gun flies into the front seat. Gin gets out of the car and starts running, but Stanley, the robber, tackles her. When she is falling, she flips the knife behind her and it sinks into Stanley's heart; killing him instantly. Once she has made sure that he is dead she cleans up the scene as best she can and drives away. For the next couple of months, she is paranoid that the police are going to find out who killed this man and arrest her, but nothing happens. She continues to work, and she discovers that Alex's new fleet of taxis are stolen police cars. However, because she has killed someone she does not see how breaking the law is such a big deal anymore. She also starts making more money by cheating her passengers using the tricks that Geoffrey and Kenny taught her. The book ends with Gin driving out of New York in her yellow taxi with an unknown lover to see the rest of the United States. Main characters * Gin (Jind≈ôi≈°ka): a female taxi driver from Prague living in the not so glamorous part of New York City * Gloria: Gin's Cuban roommate who was born and raised in Harlem * Randy: a homeless man who is a friend of Gin's * Alex: the Russian owner and dispatcher at the taxi company where Gin works * Talibe: Gin's first husband from Mali who dies while taxi driving by a serial killer * Kenny: Gin's boss at the previous garage where she worked * Clyde: Gin's boyfriend who cheats on her with Gloria * Geoffrey: one of Gin's colleagues * Ouagadougou: Gin's second husband and Talibe's cousin * Stanley: the serial killer who kills Talibe and tries to kill Gin, but is accidentally killed by Gin  Author's Inspiration for Gimme the Money  Gimme the Money was loosely based on Iva Pek√°rkov√°'s experience as a taxi-driver in New York City. She said in an interview with The Central Europe Review that she made Gin \\"...more naive than I was, so that she could discover more, so that it would be more shocking for her.\\" Pek√°rkov√° finds that it is easier for her to write stories where cultures are being blended, because she sees that as interesting. Likewise, she finds it difficult to write stories about the Czech Republic, because she cannot find any new or interesting stories from her home country. Gimme the Money has both the clashing of cultures and the Czech influence through Gin's views on New York.  Translation  While the majority of the English translation was completed by Iva Pek√°rkov√°, in order for the publisher to obtain a grant from the Czech Ministry of Culture, they included her husband, Raymond Johnson, in the translation. While he did not translate the novel, he helped Pek√°rkov√° with editing the translation. Gimme the Money was also translated into German by Marcela Euler under the title: Taxi Blues.  Critical reception  Gimme the Money was described by Madelaine Hron, Associate Professor at Wilfrid Laurier University for English and Film Studies, as \\"Fresh, gutsy, hilarious, the novel is one terrific (and terrifying) joy-ride through New York, propelled by a Czech taxi driver‚Äîa woman taxi driver at that.\\" She also appreciated how even though the novel was about New York, Gin's Croatian roots did not get lost.

In August 1974, about 200 women imprisoned at Bedford Hills rioted, taking over parts of the prison, because of the inhumane treatment of one of the leaders among the prisoners, Carol Crooks.The Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women in Bedford Hills, New York.  Causes  Crooks filed a lawsuit challenging the action of placing women in solitary confinement without a 24-hour notice of charges, hearings, and the reason for the punishment. This lawsuit was filed in July 1974, and was filed because the guards at Bedford NY Women's Prison started placing prisoners into the special housing units for reasons that were not fair or just. In August of the same year, after the judges who heard Crooks' case ruled in her favor, the prison guards reciprocated by beating her and putting her in a segregated cell. The actions of these guards resulted in the uprising of the prison that included about two hundred inmates. These inmates took action by fighting the guards and for about two and a half hours they were in control of parts of the prison.  Inmates  Carol Crooks became the poster child for the August Rebellion. Crooks (1954‚Äì2016) was a prisoner in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for women, jailed originally for first degree manslaughter, and was sentenced to 15 years in 1972. Crooks had a hard childhood with the death of her father and having to provide for her sister and mother. Crooks was arrested for manslaughter after killing a worker of her heroin distribution ring. The worker allegedly blackmailed her and, later, police found him dead by a gunshot wound. Crooks then met Cidney Reed in prison and the two became lovers. Reed, then 16, was serving a five-year sentence for robbery. When Crooks was in solitary confinement, Reed helped rally up female inmates and started the rebellion against officers. Along with Reed, another important leader was Dollree Mapp, who was known as the ‚ÄúRosa Parks for the Fourth Amendment‚Äù. Mapp refused to let officers into her home without a search warrant which led to the Mapp v. Ohio case. The case decided that evidence seized illegally from criminal prosecution to be thrown out.  Aftermath  The Bedford NY Prison Riot opened many doors for women in the prison system all over the world. Following the prison riot the women filed and won the lawsuit Powell v. Ward. This lawsuit ended in a legally binding pledge by prison guards to conduct disciplinary proceedings fairly, to only send truly mentally-ill prisoners to psychiatric hospitals, and with a monetary award for the woman, which they used on literature and appliances for the betterment of the prison. Although these women have contributed to fairness in the prison system, the mandatory inserts of male correctional officers in female prisons has led to the exploiting of their female charges.

This lake formed during the Holocene in the Darfur region, during a time when the monsoon over Africa was stronger. The existence of the lake is dated between about 9,100‚Äì2,400 years before present. This lake could have reached a surface area of , larger than present- day Lake Erie, although estimates of its size vary and it might have been much smaller. The shorelines in some places, insofar as they are recognizable, feature riparian landscapes and reeds. The lake was a freshwater lake replenished by groundwater and runoff from neighbouring mountains and might itself have been the source for the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System. The lake featured a diverse ecosystem with a number of species, and possibly facilitated the spread of species between the Nile and Lake Chad.  Name and research history  The lake is also known as \\"West Nubian lake\\", \\"West Nubian Paleolake\\" and \\"Northern Darfur Megalake\\". \\"Ptolemy lake archipelago\\" refers to dune fields that were periodically submerged along the eastern shores, forming archipelagoes. The lake name was first mentioned in a 1858 map, but its existence became clear only in 1980‚Äì1982.  Geomorphology  = Context = During the early and middle Holocene, large lakes such as Lake Chad and Lake Ptolemy developed within the Sahara and river systems such as Wadi Howar flowed, although it is not clear if they were flowing through a still desertic landscape. The formation of these paleolakes was ultimately linked to a stronger African monsoon caused by a higher axial tilt and the perihelion of Earth coinciding with late July and thus the monsoon season. Today the eastern Sahara is among the driest locations on Earth as it is far removed from oceanic moisture sources. = Lake = Lake Ptolemy is located on the territory of present-day Sudan. Estimates of its size have changed as the quality of regional maps changed: At first, it was believed to have reached surface areas of about ; later research on the basis of more reliable elevation maps suggested that it was no larger than ; later still, newer maps indicated larger surface areas of and and a volume of and , respectively. Depending on the location, evidence for water levels of or even above sea level have been found; in the former case the lake may have occupied an area of no less than . There is also evidence of shorelines at altitudes of above sea level; if they reflect the lake reaching that altitude, this stand would reach a surface of and a volume of at that stage. Such a size is comparable to Canada's largest lake, the Great Bear Lake, and larger than Lake Erie. It would have been up to deep. Lower lake stages might have reached and elevation, and there is fossil evidence that episodes of shallow water level occurred in the lake. The lake floor in its southern and western sectors reaches elevation above sea level. Shorelines developed on Lake Ptolemy's northern margin and the lake submerged two tributary valleys there; the development of dune fields on the western shore makes identification of the shores there difficult and their absence has raised questions about whether the lake actually existed at such large sizes. The shores on the southern and western side developed a riparian zone with vegetation and irregular lakefloor. River deltas formed where wadis entered Lake Ptolemy, and alluvial fans have been identified on the northwestern shores. Chalks formed in Lake Ptolemy generated yardangs, and aragonite, calcite and goethite formed deposits in the adjacent desert, often in swampy areas. Tufa pinnacles formed in the lake, and upon drying playa deposits were left behind. The lake existed in the area of present-day Wadi Howar in the Darfur Basin. Today the oases of Oyo, Bidi and Nukheila are located on the lakefloor that Lake Ptolemy occupied at maximum highstand. The lake probably resembled present day Lake Chad. = Hydrology = The lake was nourished by runoff from the Ennedi, Erdi Ma and part of the Kufrah Depression, as well as groundwater; at least one site of the lake floor shows evidence of the release of pressurized water and evidence of higher groundwater levels is widespread in the eastern Sahara. The catchment of the lake covers a surface area of , with later estimates of . This runoff reached the lake through various wadis, many of which entered Lake Ptolemy from the north, such as Wadi Fesh-Fesh. The Ennedi was critical for the water balance of lake. To the northwest the Lake Ptolemy drainage system was bordered by areas that drained north, while to the northeast drainage was northeastward. Unlike Lake Chad/Lake Megachad, Lake Ptolemy was not nourished by rivers from the humid and semi-humid tropics, but solely from regional catchments. The presence of Asphataria indicates that Lake Ptolemy was a freshwater lake especially close to its inflows, although with occasional brackish phases. Precipitation at the time was about per year. At a water level of Lake Ptolemy would have been connected with a paleodrainage system belonging to the Abyad Plateau. A connection between Lake Ptolemy and Wadi Howar which drains to the Nile is possible. but not proven. At water levels of Lake Ptolemy would overflow into Wadi Arid.  Biology  Lake Ptolemy featured a diverse ecosystem, especially in its southwestern sector where tributaries formed river deltas with diverse environments; these include banks, reed beds, shallow lakes and swamps. Plant species documented from Lake Ptolemy include Acacia and Tamarix species, as well as Balanitos aegyptiaca and Capparis decidua. The various water systems aided in the propagation of plants. Reed vegetation formed on the southern and western shores of the lake, and probably extended over its entire perimeter and sometimes into open water. The existence of Typha suggests that shallow lake phases occurred. Microbialites and stromatolites also formed on the lake shores and together with limnites are used to delimit the lake surface. Ostracods found in the lake include Candonopsis, Cyprideis, Cypridopsis, Cyprilla, Darwinula, Herpetocypris and Limnocytherae. In some places, diatoms were widespread enough to form diatomite deposits. About 10-18 fish species existed in Lake Ptolemy, such as Clarias lazera, Lates niloticus and Synodontis. Likewise, fossils of land tortoises, water tortoises and hippopotamus were found on the area of the former lake. The existence of marsh animals in the region was already reported in the map of 1858. Further animals documented in fossils include the Nile crocodile and pelomedusidae and trionychidae species. Bees, molluscs and worms were active in the lake sediments, while alcelaphinae, elephants, giraffes, other ungulates as well as other animals such as cane rats lived around the lake. The south shore of Lake Ptolemy could have been inhabited by neolithic pastoralists. In addition, many human artifacts have been found in the region surrounding the former lake, some of which may have had religious-spiritual significance.  Lake chronology  The lake basin was probably formed before the Holocene by wind-driven erosion. During the Pleistocene, a \\"Lake Sidiq\\" formed in the area of northern Lake Ptolemy. It has been dated at 21,600 ¬± 600 years before present, while no lake deposits are found dating back to the late Pleistocene; climate at that point was as dry as the present day. Lake Ptolemy existed as a freshwater lake already around 9,180 ¬± 185 years before present. A temporary low water level is dated to 7,470 ¬± 100 and 8,100 ¬± 80 years before present. This lowstand was associated with strong trophic growth; lowstands in the lake levels allowed land animals to reach the interior of the lake basin. Radiocarbon dating of chalks in a wadi that entered the lake from the north has yielded ages for a highstand of 6,680 ¬± 135 and 6,810 ¬± 70 years before present. Other dates from the northern reaches are 7,900 ‚Äì 6,400 years before present, and 9,250 ‚Äì 3,800 years before present. Dates obtained from fish fossils in the northern reaches are 2,360 ¬± 65 and 3,285 ¬± 70 years before present, during times where lake levels were less stable. No actual drying events are preserved in the fossil data. Wadis flowing into the lake were transporting water as late as 3,300 ‚Äì 2,900 and 3,300 ‚Äì 2,400 years before present on the southern and northern side, respectively. During its drying, the lake split into separate pools. Deflation has removed the youngest deposits, thus the exact time when the lake disappeared is not known. Today wind-driven erosion is the dominant process in the area; the northeasterly trade winds have formed sand deposits including barchans on the southwestern side of the former lake.  Relationship to groundwater and ecosystems  Lake Ptolemy is related to the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer; in simulations maximum water levels in the aquifer reached the surface of the lake, and about of water from the lake entered the aquifer every year. The lake further aided in the interchange between Lake Chad and Nile species.

Written by John Strand, the play was originally produced for stage performance in Washington, DC in 2015 under director Molly Smith; actor Edward Gero portrayed Scalia. The play received a positive review in The New York Times and has been produced at multiple theaters. In March 2017, the play was broadcast on public television. Plot Justice Scalia is entering a new term of the Supreme Court and reviewing applications for law clerks to serve in his office during the coming year. One of the applications he receives is from Cat, a recent woman graduate from law school who wishes to be his law clerk and who also has firmly held liberal beliefs. Scalia is intrigued and invites her for an interview. The interview leads to heated exchanges in which the potential law clerk makes strong assertions about her liberal beliefs and claims that these convictions do not mean she is unqualified to be a clerk for a conservative Justice of the Court. When Scalia protests, Cat asserts herself as a practicing Roman Catholic who has an equal voice in representing her legal opinions concerning cases coming before the Court. After some further verbal sparring, Scalia agrees to take her on as his law clerk and as someone capable of making reasoned arguments on positions which do not necessarily align completely with his own. Soon after she becomes his clerk, legal blogs begin reporting personal details of Scalia's new law clerk and details of her personal life. She feels compelled to present these to Scalia prior to them being made public in the press and causing possible embarrassment to Scalia in that way. She admits to being part of the LGBT movement and that she is involved in an LGBT relationship. Rather than becoming angry, Scalia indicates that he is better-informed than she may have thought and that he had received a preliminary report of this matter through his own review of some of the legal blogs. He accepts her statement and she continues as his legal clerk. While clerking for Scalia she has further confrontations with both Scalia and his other highly conservative law clerk. At one point, Scalia requires her to join him at a shooting range, and he teaches her to shoot a rifle. Unexpectedly, the two are able to debate issues of the Court further in a manner suggesting that Scalia is more open- minded than often-stated opinions of him as an arch-conservative. Their mutual animosity and differences of opinion begin to shift considerably when Scalia appears to suffer from heart palpitations, and she quickly comes to his side to assist him as best she can. Later, when her own father appears to become mortally ill and on his death bed, Scalia offers his own sympathy for her imminent loss. The play ends with the two of them reconciling to that fact that both their differences and their similarities appear to signify more than the direct review of the cases coming before the Court in the particular year when she is one of his law clerks. Performance The play was first performed at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC in 2015. Lead actor Edward Gero met with Scalia and observed him during a Supreme Court oral argument before portraying him onstage. The New York Times gave the play a positive review, stating: \\"Mr. Gero's portrayal is a more reflective version of Justice Scalia than the one the public sees. It is also more sympathetic than many might expect.\\"Liptak, Adam (March 11, 2015). \\"The Originalist, a New Play About Justice Antonin Scalia by John Strand\\". The New York Times. The play began its stage production at the Pasadena Playhouse in California on April 11, 2017. From July 19 to August 19, 2018, the play was performed at the 59E59 Theaters in New York City, with Gero continuing in the lead role and Tracy Ifeachor as the fictional law clerk.

S.)‚Äì22 August 1921) was a Russian painter and art instructor who founded \\"the most progressive art school in pre-1917 Russia\\". Among alumni of the school were Marc Chagall, Elena Guro, and .  Early life  Elizaveta Nikolaevna Zvantseva was born on 30 November 1864 on her family's estate Tartalee () near Nizhny Novgorod on the outskirts of Moscow to Nikolai Zvantsev and his wife, who was the daughter of Nikolai Polevoy. Polevoy, Zvantseva's maternal grandfather was a noted Russian historian and writer. On her paternal side, her great-great grandfather was an Ottoman pasha who had been killed at the battle of Zhvanets in 1769 during the 5th Russo-Tukish War. The pasha's son had been made a ward of Tsar Paul I of Russia and given the name Peter Pavlovich Zhvantsov, which later changed to Zvantsov and then became Zvantsev. In 1796, Paul I gave his ward the estate at Tartalee and his children developed the property, restoring the manor house, creating a luxurious park and building both a summer theater and small school for children. Zvantseva's father was a Collegiate Assessor and though she grew up in privilege, at the age of sixteen, she left home to make her own way. Zvantseva studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture between 1885 and 1888. For the next several years, until 1896, she studied at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts with Ilya Repin and Pavel Chistyakov. During 1889 Repin created five portraits of Zvantseva. One of these, was willed by Repin to the according to the will of the artist, was donated to the Ateneum, a museum in Helsinki. In 1897, she traveled to Paris, with her friend Konstantin Somov, where she studied with Rodolphe Julian at the Acad√©mie Julian and with at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. Career Zvantseva watercolor by Repin In 1899, Zvantseva returned to Moscow and opened an art school where painters like Konstantin Korovin, Valentin Serov and Nikolai Ulyanov taught students including Nina Simonovich-Efimova who studied there in 1900. She closed the school in Moscow in 1906. That same year, she opened drawing and painting studio in St. Petersburg, known as both the Zvantseva School of Drawing and Painting and The School of Bakst and Dobuzhinsky, until 1910. L√©on Bakst taught painting at the school and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky was the drawing instructor. Among their students were Marc Chagall, Sergey Gorodetsky, Elena Guro, Mikhail Matyushin, Heorhiy Narbut, Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Ivan Puni, Olga Rozanova, and Margarita Sabashnikova (later Woloschin). The school was founded on the fourth floor of a building at No. 25 Tavricheskaia, offered by the Russian poet Vyacheslav Ivanov, who lived on the top floor. The boundaries between apartments and households was blurred, with artists from the school mingling freely with writers who congregated at the Ivanov's space, and conjugal relations extending beyond the marriage bond. The school was a gathering place for the avant-garde and was \\"the most progressive art school in pre-1917 Russia\\". Bakst's teaching method focused on teacher and student feeding off of each other's creativity to continually feed intellectual curiosity and push boundaries in new and different ways. He left the school in 1910 and was replaced by Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin and Zvantseva continued to operate the school until April 1917.

Typical rainfall is 72 inches per annum, and the island is often shrouded in mist. It is visible from near the Glosh Tower on the Mullet Peninsula, with reference to the other islands in the area, is sometimes described as the \\"one that looks like a volcano\\". There is a small rocky islet 125m to the east with a length of 80m. There are about five rocky islets including Fish Rock, Carrickaduff and Carrackabrown spread 1km to 2km in a generally westwards direction. Waters around Blackrock Island The waters around Blackrock Island are noted for large ocean swells and waves, as evidenced by the difficulties faced in relieving the lighthouse keepers and with Rescue 116 helicopter wreckage recovery in 2017. Water depths descend to 40m within a kilometer of the island, with depths of 60m and lower more typical towards Achill Island. The Blackrock grounds are popular with sea anglers due to the attracting of larger fish species: Blue Shark; Porbeagle;Halibut and Bluefin tuna.  Blackrock Lighthouse  The lighthouse on Blackrock Island was constructed in 1864. It is a 50 foot high round stone tower with lantern and gallery attached to a single storey keeper's house. The lighthouse is painted white. It is one of Ireland's most remote lighthouses and the most westerly lighthouse off the Mayo Coast. It was converted to unmanned in 1974 after which the island became uninhabited. The lighthouse was converted to solar power in 1999. The resident lighthouse keeper of Blacksod Lighthouse on the mainland, which is still manned, is also responsible for maintaining the Blackrock lighthouse. Inspection and maintenance visits are periodically made by helicopter (via a helipad on the island), the only way to get to the island on a regular basis. In order to accommodate work-crews on extended maintenance and repair jobs at the lighthouse, one of the old keepers houses has been restored. Accidents and incidents associated with the island = Loss of lighthouse keeper in 1937 = In September 1937 the then lighthouse-keeper, Patrick Monaghan, was swept from the lighthouse by a freak wave. The visit of his descendants to the island is described in the RT√â radio documentary 'Good Day at Blackrock'. =Attack by German bomber in 1940= On 20 August 1940, a German bomber attacking the SS Macville which was passing close to the island damaged several lantern panes and the roof. A Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor of Kampfgeschwader 40 was claimed to have dropped two SD250 bombs and damaged a freighter southwest of Blacksod (possibly Macville) on this date, with other sources confirming damage (though no confirmed casualties) to Macville. =Stranding of keepers in 1942-1943= Three lighthouse keepers were stranded on Blackrock Island in the winter of 1942-1943 during the Emergency in World War II. Storms were particularly ferocious in this period and the landing stage and associated derricks were destroyed in the gales. The keepers, who normally expected to be supplied every 10 days, who started with reduced supplies due to being subject to rationing in the emergency, were at points critically low on supplies. Captain John Padden at considerable risk made several resupply attempts and supply baskets on a few occasions were successfully thrown to the island. On 17 February 1943, in a short lull in the weather he was able to relieve Walter Coupe (117 days) and Michael O'Conner (~ 90 days). Jack Scott, the principal keeper, remained to direct recovery operations. =Crash of Rescue 116 in 2017 = On 14 March 2017 the Irish coast guard Rescue R116 helicopter impacted the island with the wreckage coming to rest in 40m of water south west of the island with four persons lost. The preliminary report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit had found that (as of March 2017) Blackrock Island had been omitted or had an incorrect and significantly lower height in some terrain and obstacle databases.

Medieval Islamic materials scattered around the site's surface suggest a later occupation during the Medieval period. Binissafullet has several elements which are usually found in talayotic settlements: a talayot, a taula enclosure, a hypostyle hall, dwellings, silos... Binissafullet's Taula monument, which is the only one that has a base. In 1988 the site was deforested, whereas in 1990 its taula enclosure was excavated and restored. The taula, the main element inside the enclosure, was found on the ground during the excavations and later restored by replacing it in its upright position. Binissafullet's taula is unique due to its small dimensions and the small breadth of its vertical or supporting stone. Moreover, it is the only taula on Menorca that has been erected after having been found on the ground. The other six taulas which still stand in their upright positions have withstood the passing of time since Prehistory. Excavations conducted in the taula enclosure gave a lot of information about its use and the activities carried out inside. Fragments of Punic amphorae and faunal remains, mostly from sheep and goats, as well as remains of a hearth, indicate that ritual activities were probably performed in this building, where the consumption of wine and meat was important.Description of Binissafullet in official website of Talayotic Minorca All the artifacts and other remains located in these excavations are currently kept in the Museum of Menorca (Museu de Menorca). It is one of 32 sites that form part of the nomination series of Talayotic Minorca to become a World Heritage site by UNESCO.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Parts of the areas near the Indian Ocean occurred where the solar eclipse occurred on November 21, 1862. It was part of the solar saros 121 Description The eclipse took place in Africa including Namacqualand (then also South-West Africa, now Namibia), Bechuanaland (now Botswana) South Africa (which included the British colonies and the Boer states at the time), Basutoland (parts now Lesotho), Zululand (now part of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) and portions of Swaziland.

As the moon moved towards the left on Earth in Africa, at the peninsular portion, it was seen as it was moved towards the bottom right, then right then top as the axis spun at around the 71st parallel south.

They were set up at a time when the German occupation of France and the disruption of shipping lanes interfered with drug supplies. As in the First World War, the British found that the Germans still largely dominated the pharmaceutical industry and consequently by the early 1940s there were critical shortages of essential medicines in hospitals and homes across Britain. First the Vegetable Drugs Committee or VDC was established at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, including two Kew experts, Dr Metcalfe and Dr Ronald Melville, botanist and pharmacist. The committee found that a number of imported drugs were derived from plants that were also native to Britain. By 1941 they were publishing guides for herb collectors in the rural British communities. Various groups such as Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Women's Institutes and the elderly, were enlisted as collectors by Sir Arthur Hill, Director of Kew. In 1941 the wholesale pharmaceutical company Brome and Schimmer published a booklet called Herb Gardening, describing the many roots, flowers and herbs needed by the Ministry of Health, and how to collect and dry them. The Ministry of Supply issued monthly bulletins for rural herb committees that provided information for collecting herbs in different areas. The first bulletin in 1942 described how in Derbyshire \\"The Hathersage Women's Institutes dried fifty pounds of materials chiefly nettles in the attic of a house, and the Clifton and Mayfield Boy Scouts dried seventy-six pounds of Foxglove at their headquarters.

A leaflet from Kew advised that collectors spread the plants on racks to dry in a coke-heated shed at 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit).

A total of 70 Committees were set up across England, Scotland and Wales, and grants of a total of ¬£1,191 were made available to set up drying centres that could deal directly with trading companies. By the end of the war, there were 250 drying centres across country. Horticulturist Elizabeth Hess was the Agricultural Organiser for the Women's Institute.

It provides drinking water to almost 200,000 people, irrigates about of olives, fruit trees and agricultural crops, and supplies 25 MW of hydroelectric power. It is currently under the control of the Turkish Army. Location The dam is north of the town of Afrin in northwest Syria. It is from the city of Aleppo and from the town of Afrin, near the village of Midaneka (Maydanki). A large part of the region is planted with olive and fruit trees. About 80% of the area depends on rainwater irrigation, and the remainder on wells and pumps. Before the dam was built the orchards and other crops were irrigated, but the olive trees were not. The Afrin District is populated by Kurds, the furthest west of the Syrian Kurdish regions. The catchment area is , with annual rainfall of . The Afrin River originates in the south of the Kartal Mountains in Turkey, crosses into Syria where it runs through the city of Afrin, and then crosses back into Turkey. About of the annual flow of the river comes from the Hatay Province of Turkey, while about originates in Syria. History The dam was intended to irrigate land in the river valley in the region between Aleppo and the border with Turkey. The project was approved in 1984 after extensive studies by the Ministry of Irrigation. The dam would control the river flow and prevent flooding, would irrigate up to of land, supply drinking water in the region, provide up to 20 MW of hydroelectric power and would become a tourist attraction. Construction began in 1997. The dam was built for the General Water Resources Authority at a total cost of 58.2 billion Syrian pounds, including the cost of land acquisition for the reservoir. of earth and rock was excavated during construction. The dam was inaugurated on 24 April 2004 in the presence of Prime Minister Muhammad Naji al-Otari. Syrian state resolution No. 1849 of 2004 declared that the 17 April Dam Lake was a protected area. A 2016 report noted that water usage appeared to have dropped due to the Syrian Civil War. On 9 March 2018, during Operation Olive Branch, armed units belonging to the Syrian National Army rebel faction and the Turkish Armed Forces seized control of the dam, capturing it from the Kurdish-majority People's Protection Units (YPG). On 13 January 2019, body filling, water intake structure, reinforced concrete and mechanical cover systems were completed and repaired by the Turkish State Hydraulic Works (DSI), who renamed it the Upper Afrin Dam.

Local tourism diminished as result of the civil war, however, and mostly collapsed during Operation Olive Branch. Nevertheless, the region's tourism sector had begun to recover by July 2018, with two of the lake's ten cafes and restaurants reopened.

He has published four novels (Confessions of Brother Eli, Sun City, All for Now, and The Alzhammer), three books of poetry (Wit's End, Poems in Which, and Sightlines from the Cheap Seats), two books on childhood and adolescence co-written with psychologist and educator Michael Riera (Field Guide to the American Teenager and Right from Wrong), and two memoirs (Subway to California and The Pope of Brooklyn). His book reviews, essays, and poems have appeared in numerous journals and newspapers, and his poetry has been awarded prizes from Poetry Northwest, Bear Star Press, and Bread Loaf. In 2017, Di Prisco was named Chairman of the Simpson Family Literary Project, a non-profit organization that sponsors literary outreach in the Bay Area and the bestowal of an annual $50,000 prize to \\"an author of fiction at the relatively middle stage of a burgeoning career.\\"  Early life and education  Joseph Di Prisco was born in Greenpoint, Brooklyn to his Italian-American father Joe \\"Pope\\" Di Prisco and his Polish mother Catherine \\"Caza\\" Di Prisco. At the age of ten, he was shuttled to California by his parents, as his father was on the run from federal and local law enforcement after a career as a small-time hustler, gambler, bookmaker, petty criminal, con artist, and confidential informant. Joseph Di Prisco learned the detailed story of his father's criminal career when he came upon transcripts of New York State Appellate Division trials in which his father was the star witness. Di Prisco wrote about this discovery in his memoir The Pope of Brooklyn (Rare Bird Books, 2017). Di Prisco attended a Catholic boys' high school in California, graduated summa cum laude from Syracuse University, and went on to earn a PhD in English Literature from University of California, Berkeley, writing his dissertation on Mark Twain. Di Prisco subsequently taught English in schools and college for twenty years at places such as San Francisco University High School. At other times in his life he was a novice Brother in a Roman Catholic novitiate, a restaurant manager, wine consultant, and, for several years, a high-stakes professional blackjack player, traveling the world while bankrolled by big-money backers.  Non-profit work  In 2017, Di Prisco spearheaded a new collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley English Department and the Lafayette Library called The Simpson Family Literary Project. This organization sponsors high school creative writing programs in the Bay Area, in addition to bringing an annual Writer-in- Residence. The 2017 Writer-in-Residence is Joyce Carol Oates. The foundation also awards an annual $50,000 prize to an author of fiction in the middle of his or her career. Di Prisco is also involved as a contributor or supporter of the California Shakespeare Theater, the Ann Martin Center, Playworks, Girls Inc, ZYZZYVA Magazine, the University of California, Berkeley, the Lafayette Library and Learning Center Foundation, The Oakland 100, and more. He is Chair Emeritus of the Redwood Day School.  Themes in Di Prisco's works  Di Prisco frequently draws upon his own life experiences in his work, where he fictionalizes them in a larger satire of a genre or narrative. Thus The Alzhammer follows a crime mob boss who is suffering from Alzheimer's; All For Now takes on pedophilia in the Catholic Church, the afterlife, and modern media. Critics have remarked upon the humorous and playful aspects of Di Prisco's work, which at the same time delivers powerful commentary on its subjects. Di Prisco's memoirs and novels have been praised by Jerry Stahl, Anne Hillerman, Dean Young, Steven Gillis and P. F. Kluge, among others.

Dante was an active painter for over six decades. His roots started in Boston, Massachusetts, with a group of other emerging artists later known as the Boston Expressionists. Giglio Dante can be seen pictured alongside his contemporaries in ARTnews, which published a John Brook portrait of eleven Boston painters including Karl Zerbe, Reed Champion, Ture Bengtz, Maud Morgan, Kahlil Gibran (sculptor), Esther Geller, Carl Pickhardt, John Northey, Thomas Fransioli, and Lawrence Kupferman.  Biography  Giglio Dante came to Boston from Rome in 1921. His father, a respected muralist, trained him in the classical techniques of oil-tempera and fresco. Considered a teenage prodigy, Dante started painting portraits and murals at a young age. In the mid-1930s when working for the W.P.A., he was commissioned to paint two murals, depicting working Italian immigrants, at the Michelangelo School located on Charter Street in Boston. The murals were not without controversy as some residents considered the depiction of Italians as unhappy laborers. Many of his early paintings show the influence of Rouault and Picasso. It was at this time he broke with his father in his portrait work and the traditions of a classical painter and became and an active member in the Boston Expressionists Movement. The Sgraffito technique with semi-abstract symbolism was widely used by Dante in the 1930s and 40s. He exhibited at the famous Boris Mirski Gallery and taught classes at the Mirski school of Art. He was also part of the dramatic Abstract Expressionist Movement in New York during the mid 1940s and 50s. He contributed to the Provincetown art colony during this period and was one of two founders of Studio Five, a collective artist studio, with sculptor Kenneth Campbell. Dante showed his work in Boston and New York City during the 1940s and moved permanently to New York in the 1950s. He became part of the Betty Parson Gallery for 10 years and sold with the likes of Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, and Barnett Newman. He was one of the first artists to move into the Westbeth Artists Community in 1970 where he exhibited in their major shows. It was during this period he started with the abstract sculpture technique of Assemblage. He started dividing his time during the mid 1970s between Westbeth NYC and East Hampton, NY. He finally moved permanently to East Hampton in 1981. Dante continued painting and in 1986 he won Best in Show at Guild Hall's Annual Artist Members Exhibition for his mixed media work of ‚ÄúPortrait of Contessa V.‚Äù Giglio Dante died at age 92 on December 12, 2006.

The church is one of the earliest remaining structures in both the town of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o and the state of Sergipe; it is also one of the main elements of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the S√£o Francisco Square in the Town of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o. Our Lady of Victory remains home to an active congregation and belongs to the Archdiocese of Aracaju. History Our Lady of Victory was built as a parish church in 1608 by Dom Constantino Barradas, the fourth Bishop of Bahia, during the pontificate of Pope Paul V. It bears the crest of Philip IV of Spain as Brazil was a colony within the Iberian Union (1580-1640). The church was eventually elevated to an Episcopal See. It was heavily damaged during the eight years of Dutch rule in S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, from 1637 to 1645; the city served alternately as a base for Portuguese guerillas and as a seat of power for the Dutch. S√£o Crist√≥v√£o was greatly expanded after the end of Dutch rule and Our Lady of Victory was reconstructed by local inhabitants. The town sent an appeal to the King of Portugal for money for a full renovation of the church in 1666, and eventually received 4,000 cruzados in 1702. Our Lady of Victory served as a nucleus for the construction of other religious structures in S√£o Crist√≥v√£o; its renovation was followed by the construction of the Church and Convent of Santa Cruz (Convent of San Francisco) (1693), the Convent and Church of the Order of Carmo (1699), Miseric√≥rdia Hospital and Church and the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men (1743). Structure Our Lady of Victory was constructed on the side of a hill on the highest point in the upper city (cidade alta). It sits at the head of Pra√ßa S√£o Francisco de Assis plaza, now known as Pra√ßa Getulio. It has an imposing fa√ßade with two towers covered in white Portuguese tile. The doors of the church are in decorated wood. The interior of the church is simple with paintings attributed to Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus (1758-1847). Protected status The Parish Church of Our Lady of Victory was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) in 1976. The structures were registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 263-A and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fls. 57. Both directives are dated March 20, 1943.

The stone bay bridge is situated at the mouth of Luoyang River. Being the first stone bay bridge in China, it enjoys the reputation of \\" one of the four ancient bridges of China\\". The project started from the fifth year (1053) of Huangyou's ruling period in northern song dynasty. Cai xiang, the chief of Quanzhou prefercture in the 3rd year (1058) of Jiayou's reign, took over the task of constructing the bridge, who had overcome several difficulties concerning bridge deck pavement and bridge pier by applying a raft foundation and raising oysters in the river to solid the base. In the fourth year (1059) of Jiayou's reign, the construction of Luoyang bridge was completed and Caixiang wrote \\"The Wan'an bridge\\" for it. The bridge had been reconstructed and repaired in the later dynasties. In the southern song dynasty, pagodas and fengshui pagodas were built outside the guardrail of the bridge. The bridge is 1200 meters long, and has 46 piers in total. The north part of the bridge is in the territory of Hui'an county while the south is in Luojiang district. The middle part is located in a river island called Zhongzhou. Pagodas and tower joss can be found both on the bridge and Zhongzhou island. Luoyang bridge was listed as a key cultural relics unit under the national protection in 1988, and in 2009, it was selected as one of the cultural world heritage sites along the maritime silk road.  History  The panoramic view of Luoyang bridge Stone carving on Luoyang bridge The stone sculpture of Cai Xiang Luoyang bridge, also known as Wan'an bridge, is named for being situated on the Luoyang river. Legend has it that in the Tang dynasty, emperor Xuanzong of Tang disguised himself and went to the street to inspect people's lives. He stopped by a river in north-west hui'an county, Quanzhou, and claimed the scenery by the river was somewhat similar to what he saw in Luoyang. Therefore, the river has been called Luoyang river ever since. Before it was built, there was a ferry crossing called Wan'an to help locals cross the river. The ferry was in the estuary, and accidents frequently resulted from harsh winds and high seas, and crossings were impossible for several days. During the reign of Qingli in northern song dynasty, one of the Quanzhou locals, Lichong, used stones as piers and wood as deck to build a floating bridge to help passersby cross the river; however, it was destroyed by water more than once. In the fifth year (1053) of Huangyou's reign, another Quanzhou local, Wangshi, capped and fixed the floating bridge, which was the starting point of constructing Luoyang bridge officially. During the construction, they encountered many problems including the lack of funds, the extreme difficulty of building seven of the bridge piers and the deck. In the July of the 3rd year (1058) of Jiayou's reign, Caixiang was appointed as the chief of the Quanzhou prefecture, and then he actively participated in the construction of the bridge. He called on donation, cultured oysters to fix the piers, and took advantage of the ebb and flow to successfully build the deck. In the December of the 4th year (1059) of Jiayou's reign, the construction was completed, and Caixiang wrote \\"The Wan'an bridge\\" to memorialize it. Luoyang bridge became the first bay bridge in Chinese history. From the northern song dynasty to contemporary times, eight pagodas and fengshui towers have been built around Luoyang bridge. According to records, Luoyang bridge had been repaired and maintained 17 times from its completion to 1993, among which the one made in the 8th year (1138) of Shaoxing's reign in southern song dynasty was the first. In the 6th year (1408) of Yongle in Ming dynasty and the 4th year (1453) of Jingtai, the bridge went through reconstruction. In Jiajing's reign of Ming dynasty, barracks were built on the Zhongzhou island, the middle part of Luoyang bridge, to resist Japanese pirates. The bridge survived unscathed a major earthquake in the 32nd year (1604) of Wanli in Ming dynasty. During Chongzhen's reign, Japanese pirates almost disappeared, and a pavilion was built on the old barracks, which was named \\"Jinghong pavilion\\" (rainbow in the mirror). In the 20th year of Qing emperor Kangxi's reign (1681), in the eighth year of Yongzheng's reign (1761) and the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843), the bridge was damaged and was repaired. In the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860), attempts were made to carry out further repairs. The 19th Route Army, who were garrisoned in the Quanzhou area, reinforced the main body of the bridge in 1932, fixing piers and using steel reinforced concrete for girders and decking. During the Sino-Japanese war, this bridge was destroyed by the Japanese army. It was repaired in 1946, but during the second Chinese civil war, the national revolutionary army destroyed the bridge again. The cultural relics were all ruined, and the only thing left was the pier. Later, the People's Republic of China spared every efforts to repair the bridge. In 1961, it was listed as one of the cultural relics unit of Fujian province. In 1974, because of the serious damage of Luoyang bridge, it was no longer capable of serving as a transporting bridge, thus the highway bureau built a new highway bridge 700 meters away from the Luoyang bridge in the upstream. Luoyang bridge officially became the passage to connect the shores of Luo river, and also a heritage bridge. It became a cultural relics unit under national protection in 1988. In 1991, it was officially listed as a reconstruction project, which started in 1993 and completed in 1996. It was selected as one of the cultural world heritage along the maritime silkroad in 2009.  Structure  = The structure of the main body = \\"Raft foundation\\" in the upstream of Luoyang Bridge pier Luoyang bridge, located in the mouth of Luo yang river in Quanzhou, Fujian province, is a stone bay bridge. It has north‚Äìsouth orientation, extending from the dyke made of stones, passing an island called \\"Zhongzhou\\" in the middle of the river, and entering Luojiang district in its south end. It is 731.29 meters in length. The south side bridge approach is 80.5 meters long, 7 meters wide. The north side bow bridge is 11 meters long, 7 meters wide, and the main deck is 5 meters wide. There are 47 apertures and 46 piers. Piers are built up by boulder strips. The boulder strips on the top two levels extend to both right side and left side in order to reduce the span of the slabstone. Cutwater can be found in the upstream of the pier bottom, whose sharp end is slightly cocking-up, a \\"raft foundation\\". The bridge plate is made of large-scale boulder strips. Back to the ancient time, the engineer took the advantage of ebbs to successfully build the plate. On both sides of the plate, there are 500 stone guardrails to protect passers-by from falling into the river. = Subsidiary buildings =  The stone tower  Luoyang Bridge south side Moonlight Buddha Tower There are 7 stone towers outside the guardrails of the bridge, among which 3 are pagodas of multi-storied pavilion type, 1 Baoqie Sutra-printing house, 1 Five wheel tower, 1 Jing Zhuang, 1 Zheng feng tower (repress the wind), and 1 foundation base. From south to north, these 7 towers are: * On the east side of the south end, there is a stupa style pagpda, which is 5 meters high, with a square foundation base, a round tower body. A niche door opens in its south side, and one relief sculpture of diamond guard can be found on both sides. A hexagon turret cover can be found on the guards, which has a 3-layer wheel and a Sarah on the top. * On the west side of the north end, there is a 3-stored hexagon solid pagoda, which has a square foundation made of boulder strips and 2.6 meters long on each side of the foundation. The pedestal is equilateral hexagon. On each side of the first layer of the tower body, there is a Buddha sculpture; the six word mantra tantra on the second; and a carving letter of \\"Fo\\" (Buddha) on the east side, and \\"Shi, Fang, San, Shi, Yiqie\\" on other sides. Thatsa can be found on the top of the tower, below which there are covered bowl, wheel, and Sarah. * On the south side of the atrium bridge in Zhengzhou island, there is a 3-meter high Zhenfeng tower, whose body is a cone shape with no sculpture on it. A monument said \\"Zhenfeng tower on Luoyang bridge\\" is on one side of the tower. * On the northwest side of Zhongzhou island, a square Baoqie sutra- printing pagoda is built in the jointing place of the island and the bridge. The relief sculpture of mountains, rivers, plants and gods is on its foundation base. On 4 sides of the tower, there is a sculpture of the Buddha, whose shape and structure is almost the same as the \\"Moonlight Buddha tower\\" depicted in the following section. * To the north of the Zhengzhou island, on the pier of the middle part of the bridge, there stands a Baoqie sutra- printing pagoda, which is 3.64 meters high and has a square base of 0.95 meters long on each side. The tower is 2-storied. On the first level, there is a sitting Buddha on 4 sides of the tower. The upper store is relatively high and far from the ground. In its direction of facing the river, a Buddha head is carved on the tower, and on the left and right sides of the head sculptured \\"moonlight Buddha\\" and \\"built in the year of Jihai\\". It is the only tower on Luoyang bridge which has the indication of the founding time and year. Archaeologists confirm that the tower was built in the 4th year (1059) of Jiayou in northern song dynasty according to its sculpturing style. A 1.6-meter high thatsa is above the tower, below which there are covered bowl, wheel, and Sarah. * On the north end of the bridge, there are two 5-stored octagonal solid stone pagodas on each side of the bridge, with the same shape, structure and sculptures. They are around 6 meters high, and have a square base made of boulder strips. The foundation of the tower is equilateral octagonal shape, each of the turret cover is hexagon shape with the sculpture of bricks and hooks. On the due south, west, east and north side of each layer, there is a sitting Buddha relief sculpture. The Thatsa was built in later years, which is a cone shape and with no wheel.  Joss  joss protecting the bridge on each end. On the south end and the north end of Luoyang bridge, there are 2 stone joss protecting the bridge on each end. The joss is 1.63 meters high, facing each other, and they were all built during the northern song dynasty. Those sculptures all have Han nationality (the majority group of people in China), wearing hamlet and armor, holding long sword in hands.  Bridge pavilion  Luoyang Bridge Zhongzhou island There are two stone pavilions on Zhongzhou island. One is called \\"Zhongting\\" (the middle pavilion), a foursquare pavilion located in the north side of Zhongzhou island. The exact year of its building is unable to verify. The existing pavilion is, in fact, reconstructed on the basis of the body in the late Qing and early Ming dynasty, after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The other pavilion is called \\"Xi chuan sweet rain pavilion\\", built to commemorate the magistrate of Jinjiang county, Fang Ke, in Ming dynasty. Folklore has it that Fang's prayer for rain came true, then folks built this pavilion to commemorate him.  Memorial architecture  A ancestral temple to commemorate Cai Zhonghui can be found 500 meters away from the south end of the bridge, which was built by descendants to remember Cai's contribution to build Luoyang bridge. This temple starts to build in northern song dynasty, and the existing one is in the construting style of Qing dynasty, which is oriented north and south and have 3 halls with 3 rooms. Zhaohui temple is built in the north side of the bridge, and the existing temple is also in Qing's style. It has 2 halls with 5 rooms. The exact year when the temple started to build is lost track, but archaeologists assume its predecessor is Zhenhai nunnery and then changed its name to Zhaohui temple. On the south end of the bridge, there are many sculptures made during the construction process, including the famous \\"Wan'an bridge\\", which has 153 letters on the 3-meter high and 1.5-meter wide stone monument. Besides, 26 monuments with carvings, which are from different periods of the bridge construction can be found in the north side of the bridge, Zhongzhou island and south side.  Conservation  The stone sculpture of Cai Xiang Food stalls and restaurants are everywhere on the bridge plate and on both sides of the bridge. Dinning-tables were put on the north and south side of the bridge back in 2005. In 2006, some people ignored the rule and made food stalls inside the pavilion which stands in the center of Luoyang bridge. The waste came from cooking might have damaged the stone bridge, thus municipal law enforcement department took action and changed the situation by removing the stalls. In 2010, some residents living in nearby villages tried to build a buddha temple without the government permission, which is forced to stop by government. Few months later, these residents tried again to build a stone buddha sculpture in the south end of the bridge, still with no permission of the government. In 2008, severe deposition and piles of wastes in both river ways had affected the fishermen's life, and also raised the tension in terms of conservation of the bridge. Quanzhou municipal government planned to invest 7 million RMB to tackle this problem, improving the environment and clearing the river way. In 2015, a large number of mangrove had grown on the coastline and extended to the areas around Luoyang bridge. Then a debate went on to discuss whether the mangrove would have a bad impact on Luoyang bridge. The culture relics management office organized a team to cut down the 30 trees growing around the bridge. In November 2016, the plan of improving the environment around Luoyang bridge officially submitted to national culture relics bureau, and most parts of the plan got approval in December, expect the part for dredging.

He was a captain in the Irish Citizen Army and was the first rebel to be killed during the Rising. Early life and family Connolly was born in Sandymount, Dublin in 1882. His father Michael led the Fenians to the battleground at Tallaght during the Fenian Rising in 1867, at the age of 11. He was also involved in the ITGWU. He attended St. Joseph's Secondary C.B.S. in Fairview. Easter Rising On Easter Monday morning when the ICA was about to march towards their positions from Liberty Hall and start the Rising James Connolly approached Connolly, told him how much time he had to get to Dublin Castle, shook his hand and said \\"Good luck Sean! We won't meet again\\". At 11:45 am that same day he led a group of ICA members towards Dublin Castle. At the main gate of the castle DMP officer James O'Brien, who was attempting to close the gate, was shot dead. Accounts vary as to whether Sean Connolly or another fighter shot him. They then tied up six sentries in the castle guard room. British Army major AJ Price, who had heard shots fired, ran out to the castle courtyard and fired at Connolly and the other ICA members before retreating. Connolly and those under his command retreated to City Hall. Within an hour of the retreat he was shot dead on the roof of City Hall by a British sniper. Dr Kathleen Lynn describes the event: > We noticed Sean Connolly coming towards us, walking upright, although we had > been advised to crouch and take cover as much as possible. We suddenly saw > him fall mortally wounded by a sniper's bullet from the castle. First aid > was useless. He died almost immediately. Helena Molony, who also witnessed his death, recalled that his younger brother Matt, who was fifteen at the time, was on the City Hall roof and \\"cried bitterly\\" over his death. According to his own witness statement, it was not until 6:00 the next morning that Kathleen Lynn told him of his brother's death.http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS1746.pdf After he was shot, Molony said a prayer into his ear. Personal life As well as a revolutionary, Connolly was an actor in the Abbey Theatre. His last part was the lead in Under Which Flag by James Connolly. He and his wife, Christina, had three children, Margaret, Kevin and Aidan. Christine Connolly was active during the War of Independence; during the Civil War she took the Treaty side.

The spladle is a wrestling technique commonly used as a counter and pinning move to single leg take downs. When opponents shoot in and grab the leg the wrestler will drop their weight on the opponents head to prevent advancement of the take down, from there they may reach across the body with their arms to grab hold of the opponents far side leg, once completed they wrap the near side leg with the leg targeted for the take down and roll forward onto the mat. When on the floor it is important to control both legs of the opponent as the wrestler wants to bring the knees of his opponent as close to inline with the opponents head as possible. As a pin that is the result of countering a take down, this is a very effective technique to use when possible in order to score, however the position in which the two wrestlers land can breed controversy as to who the points will go to. While the wrestler caught in the spladle is certainly unable to effectively do anything, let alone escape, the one who uses it in some cases may have their shoulders flat to the mat as well which could result in them being judged as the one being pinned in some cases. This is caused because it is likely that their shoulder rolled onto the mat first, to determine this the referee would need to reflect on the match he witnessed or review any tape there is if it is available for viewing in order to determine the victor.  Variations  * Counter: This technique is very often used as a counter style move a variety of the single leg take downs (typically not high crotch unless it is possible to bring down to a manageable position the one attempting said take down) by reaching across the back and getting a hold of both legs as described at the top of the article. While this is the most used variation and the one most commonly seen in competition or demonstration purposes it is not the only way of using this technique. * Offensive: From certain positions on the mat the opponent may wrap a leg from where there are positions in which one may catch the spladle, typically when the wrestler on the bottom is attempting to reverse positions by attacking a leg with hopes of executing something similar to a single leg style take down, ankle pick or reversal technique involving the wrapping or control of a singular leg. With this sort of style to the spladle where the wrestler on top is working for a pin while the other stalls him or is not sure what to do, there are many possibilities present in order to work towards this pin.  Double pinning  As previously stated in this article, the way by which the wrestlers fall and how they end up on the mat in the end can create confusion as to who will win. This is caused by both competitors landing with their shoulders flat on the mat, this is known as a double pin, while not very common of an occurrence they still can happen and result in the point being awarded to the dominant wrestler or the one being pinned based on what happened in the movements and moments leading up to it. Should the wrestler, who is placing the other in the hold, if his shoulders land flat on the mat first he will be the one deemed as pinned, and should the wrestler placed in the pin have his shoulders land flat first then he will be judged to be the one pinned. In order to avoid this situation it is necessary to, once holding the pin, attempt to ensure that the shoulders stay at minimum 20 degrees off the mat.  Uses outside of wrestling  This technique has uses as a submission as well as a pin, because of the high amount of possible strain placed on the back and hamstrings this hold has a high potential for leading a competitor to quit because of the pain, leading to the submission victory in sports like mixed martial arts, submission wrestling and other grappling sports designed for submission. The effectiveness of this pin as a submission is comparable to the \\"twister\\" in the way it places a lot of force on ones spine leading to a lot of pain. Another submission and pin it is similar to it the \\"electric chair\\" or \\"banana split\\" in that it forces the legs of the one captured in it apart, forward or back in such a way the it puts a lot of tension on the hamstring, quad and crotch muscles in the legs which could result in the tearing of said muscles if the competitors and referee are not careful to stop or hold the submission (pin) so no further tension is placed on the legs.

The geological structure of the area is suitable for large underground natural gas storage facilities. The salt formation covers an area of . It is long and around thick. It has a salt dome structure. To create the caverns in the salt formation, fresh water was brought by pipeline from Hirfanlƒ± Dam at distance. Using the process of solution mining, water was injected through a borehole into the salt formation, and the saline water, which is formed after dissolution of salt in water, was pumped back to the surface leaving a void in the formation. The salt water was transported to far away Lake Tuz by pipeline. Gas pressure inside the storage is nearly . The contract for the project was signed between the Turkish BOTA≈û and the Chinese Tianchen Engineering Company (TCC) in 2012, and the construction started in 2013. For the financing, World Bank provided a loan in amount US$325 million in 2006. Another loan in amount of US$400 million was secured in 2014. The first phase of the storage construction completed in February 2017. It is expected that storage will be fully in service in 2019. When completed, the facility will be capable of storing 10% of the natural gas consumed. Planned goal for total capacity is set to 20% of the consumed natural gas. The cost of the development was US$700 million. The storage ensures supply safety in accordance with hourly, daily and seasonal needs. It eliminates supply-demand disparity. Stored natural gas will be withdrawn in times of extreme cold weather or when the water level in the dams are reduced in drought. It also helps price stability.

A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the first of four eclipses that took place that year, the first three were partial, the next occurred on June 28, 1870, a part of it occurred in the same area on an ocean as the previous eclipse. It was part of solar saros 148. Description The eclipse took place in almost the whole of Antarctica (much of it in areas that had a 24-hour daylight at the time) except for areas within the Indian Ocean which it was nighttime and the peninsular portion and its surrounding islands. It included a part of the southernmost areas of the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic a small part of the south of the Indian Ocean. The eclipse went as far as hundreds of miles (or kilometers) south of East London, South Africa and around the same parallel with Cape Town. The eclipse started at sunrise in the Indian Ocean and ended at sunset in Antarctica. A very small part occurred on the location of the previous eclipse, many areas occurred on the opposite side. The greatest eclipse was off the shore of Antarctica at 69.9 S & 100 E at 15:26 UTC (9:26 PM local time) and occurred at sunset. The eclipse began at sunrise in the Pacific Ocean and finished at sunset off the coast of Africa. It showed up to 25% obscuration at the middle of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Billie, a young graduate student in Harlem, deals with her husband Othello leaving her for a white woman named Mona.Harlem Duet, Djanet Sears, 1997, Nightwood Theatre, Toronto The play moves through time to show Billie and Othello's relationship (or an analogue thereof) being torn apart by racial tensions at a Southern US cotton plantation in 1860, and in Harlem in 1928 and the present. Though the characters draw inspiration from Shakespeare's play Othello, Billie and the story are original creations. Sears received the Governor General's Award for Best New Play and the Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award for Harlem Duet.  Plot summary  =Act 1= Harlem, 1928. Billie and Othello discuss his infidelity with an unnamed white woman. Harlem, Present. Billie lives in a walkup at the intersection of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Boulevard in Harlem, NY. She is emotionally and intellectually broken, as her husband Othello has left her for a white colleague named Mona. Billie is supported by her landlady and by Amah, Othello's sister, while she writes and lives as a shut-in. Southern US, 1860. Othello, here a slave and blacksmith, woos Billie by gifting her his mother's handkerchief. Harlem, Present. Billie is experimenting with chemical tonics and warns Amah that they are deadly if ingested. She ignores the ringing phone, believing it to be Othello - Amah suggests it may be Billie's estranged father, Canada. Othello finally arrives with Mona (who is never seen on stage) to retrieve his things. He and Billie begin to divide their books and dive into a conversation on race relations and how cultural pressures impacted their marriage. Eventually, Othello kisses Billie and they make love. Afterwards, he brushes her off and lies to Mona in front of her. Southern US, 1860. Othello tells Billie that he will not flee to Canada with her because he has fallen in love with his white mistress, 'Miss Dessy'. Harlem, Present. Billie prepares to move out of the apartment she shared with Othello. He returns with her pot, and with news: he is reneging on his promise to pay for one of her graduate school courses, and he and Mona are engaged. He attempts to defend himself by saying that being with white women is easier. Harlem, 1928. Othello is dead on the floor, holding his handkerchief. Billie stands over him with a bloody straight razor. Harlem, Present. Billie concocts a potion and pours it over Othello's handkerchief, but before she can enact her plan, Magi interrupts with news of a visitor. It is Billie's long-absent father, Canada. =Act 2= Harlem, Present. Billie takes tea with Canada, who is eager to reunite with her. He presents her with her mother's ring and tries to make plans to visit again, but she is uncertain. The next day, Othello is back and Billie tells him she wants to return his handkerchief (given to earlier Billie in 1860), but that she needs a few days to 'find' it. Southern US, 1860. Othello is lynched by hanging. Billie tells a story of a black man who wished to be white to his body. Harlem, Present. Billie prepares the poisoned handkerchief and places it in a red box for Othello. In the process, she stains her hands with the solution and panics. She becomes violently ill (or possibly high), and Canada and Magi have an awkward conversation as they wait for her to recover. She finally emerges, and reconciles with Canada as he holds her and apologizes for being absent for so long. Harlem, 1928. Othello and Billie sit in a dressing room as Billie shaves him. He claims he will never wear Blackface on stage, and says he is of Ira Aldridge stock, a great Black actor. Then he reveals that his White lover Mona is giving him the opportunity to play Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Billie cuts his throat with the razor. Harlem, Present. Billie confesses to Magi that she plans to give Othello the poisoned handkerchief, but Magi argues that if African magic worked, the masters of slaves in the 1800s would have died a thousand times over. Billie is sick with anger and half-starved. She fantasizes (or remembers) seeing the apartment for the first time with Othello. They jump over a broom together, a traditional ceremony of marriage, and the memory dissipates. Magi takes Billie into the kitchen to feed her. Later, Canada is cleaning the kitchen and encounters Othello, looking for the promised handkerchief. Othello sees the red box Billie prepared before her breakdown and takes it, telling Canada to say goodbye to Billie as she is absent. Harlem, Present. Othello is alone in a dressing room, dressing in tails and a top hat. He practices Othello's speech to Desdemona's father while applying black greasepaint - by the end of the speech he is in full Blackface. Harlem, Present. Billie sings - she is in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. Amah visits her, but is unable to explain Billie's condition to the white doctors. Canada enters and promises that he will not leave Billie alone again. They begin to sing Spanish Harlem together as the lights go down.  Themes And References  = Race and History = The play's main theme is the impact of race on social interactions. Sears' aim is to give a more significant place to black characters on the Canadian stage. A possible interpretation of the play is that Othello has internalized racism and yearns for the white acceptance. Elizabeth Gruber highlights the role of Mona as an access point to the white world and culture. This play also reasserts the existence of an African culture remaining among slaves descendants with the choice of its location, Harlem. The stage directions often reference strong symbols of African-American culture and history while ancient African customs permeate the play through Billie's interest in Voodoo. Harlem, as a significant and symbolic location, is portrayed historically, politically and musically through the recurrence of African-American jazz music cues and audio recordings throughout the piece, including pieces from: * Martin Luther King Jr. * March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom * Malcolm X * United States Declaration of Independence * Marcus Garvey * Paul Robeson * Louis Farrakhan * Jesse Jackson * O. J. Simpson murder case * Aretha Franklin * Michael Jackson * Million Man March * Langston Hughes The play also engages in the recent concern for the construction of a Canadian-ness, embodied by Billie's father, Canada. According to Louise Harrington, the play relates to the movement of emancipation from English literature by adapting Shakespeare in a more political and contemporary way. = Literary Sources = Harlem Duet is an offshoot of William Shakespeare‚Äôs tragedy Othello. The plot revolves around the interracial marriage; the characters are named after Shakespeare‚Äôs characters: Othello and Desdemona (Mona in the present days and Miss Dessy in 1860). Harlem Duet is set in a time period immediately before Othello as a prequel to Shakespeare's play, and the curse Billie puts on the Othello's handkerchief provides an explanation as to why harm came to everyone in Shakespeare's play that touched the handkerchief that Othello gave Desdemona. = Playwright's Notes = The following notes by the playwright Djanet Sears were included in the programme for the 2018 performance at the Tarragon Theatre: In 1963, after Martin Luther King's \\"I have a Dream\\" speech at the March on Washington, Malcolm X told a journalist that Martin's dream would become a nightmare before it was over. Harlem Duet explores both the dream and the nightmare. Set in three eras, 1860, just prior to the emancipation proclamation, 1928, during the Harlem Renaissance, and contemporary Harlem, at the corner of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X boulevards (an actual place in New York City, 125th Street and Lennox Avenue), Harlem Duet is a non- chronological prequel to Shakespeare's Othello. That is, events in Harlem Duet take place before the events in Shakespeare's story, although the time-frames in Harlem Duet are subsequent to those in Shakespeare's drama. Shakespeare is a god in the theatre. He is the most famous playwright in the history of the world, and Othello is the most well-known Black character in all of theatre. In fact, Othello has achieved an archetypal status of mythic proportion. But portraits of Othello, the character, or Othello the syndrome (morbid jealousy), all appear to have been painted by non-Black people. I wondered who would Othello be if he were alive today? Who was Othello in my world, in my culture? I soon realized that I might actually know this guy, this Othello. I might, in fact, know him quite well. I was assisted here by the convergence of two pieces of text that Mr. Shakespeare kindly provided. The first centered on an inconsistency in statements that Othello makes in reference o the origin of Desdemona's handkerchief (a major plot point in Shakespeare's play). In act three, scene four, Othello declares: ...That handkerchief did an Egyptian to my mother give; she was a charmer, and could almost read the thoughts of people. However in the last act of Shakespeare's work, as we approach the climax of the play, Othello supplies a completely different account of the strawberry spotted cloth, referring to it as: ...An antique token my father gave my mother. This contradiction in the provenance of the handkerchief suggested to me that neither narrative likely contained the entire truth of the matter. What also fascinated me was why absolutely everyone who touched the handkerchief in Shakespeare's play came to harm. Was there magic or malice woven into the web of that cloth? Moreover, who exactly would have placed it there, and why? I often refer to Harlem Duet as a rhapsodic blues tragedy, in that it uses a blues aesthetic as a structural guide. The blues is a true art form, \\"It can be very profound. It tells the truth, but it's got a special sound, too, a special feeling,\\" as Robert Switzer insists in his essay, \\"Signifying the Blues,\\" \\"...a feeling... that can come upon you, that can come 'falling down like rain.'\\" Blues songs have got to have that feeling in them because you can't play the blues right unless you feel them. You can't share that feeling unless you feel it yourself. As such, Harlem Duet emerges as a 7 stanza blues told in two acts. Using linear and non-linear narrative structures, the play embraces discernible blues qualities that assert tendencies of \\"antiphonal structures\\" (that is call and response), repetition, syncopation, fragmentation, solos, polyrhythmic improvisation, percussive melodies, hollers, scatting, ring shouts, and cyclicality. *** 21 years ago when Nightwood Theatre premiered Harlem Duet at the Tarragon Theatre Extra Space, an audience member came up to me to tell me how much she had loved the play. She then added, \\"This is not a Black play. This is a human play.\\" Why would she believe that there was a difference? Aren't all Black experiences, human experiences? Aren't all Black plays, human plays? Djanet Sears - September 2018 Productions Harlem Duet was first produced by Nightwood Theatre in 1997 at Toronto's Annex Theatre. Sears directed a production of the play in 2002 at Blue Heron Arts Centre in New York City. The 2006 production at the Stratford Festival was the festival's first work by an African-Canadian playwright, and also the first to be directed by a black woman. Harlem Duet was performed in the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto from September 18 to October 28 as part of their 2018-2019 season.

Since an early age, she was interested in culture, especially language learning. She was in contact, thanks to her father's social position, with the Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria. Early life She was born in Palma on June 10, 1845, in a high level family. This opened doors to an education that very few women of the time could access. Her father, Manuel de las Herreros, was director of the Instituto Balear (an institution that had a major importance in the pedagogical renewal of the Balearic Islands) and one of her uncles was a professor. She showed great interest in reading that made her stand out among the students of the schools of Bernat Homar and Alexandre Perell√≥. In the same way she later emphasized her knowledge of English, French, Italian and German, apart from Catalan (her mother tongue). Before marrying, at a time when she was active as a teacher and writer, it was customary to see her at the Ateneo Balear (which had just opened for women). Following her marriage to lawyer Enric Bonet i Ferrer in 1872, they had fourteen children and her dedication to this area diminished.  Career  During her years of more involvement with the literary world, she wrote in prose and verse works of customs. She was part of the editorial offices of Mallorcan magazines such as La Dulzaina, Balar Magazine and the calendar El Saracossano and published in magazines of the Principality as Lo Gay Saber and Calendari Catal√†. She developed good relations with Catalan writers of the Renaixen√ßa that were accompanied by her willingness not to be part of the contests or the Floral Games and not to gather all of her literary output in one volume.  Later life  Manuela was widowed in 1899 and four years later, in 1903, her father died. He was the director of the Balearic Institute and president of the Economic Society of Friends of the Country, and a literary collaborator and administrator of the Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria. She occupied the post of administrator of the Archduke. He died on April 29, 1911 in Palma, a city that would be called illustrious daughter in December 1915.

They replaced an earlier method, the Command Interview Board, and were the precursors to today's Army Officer Selection Boards. The WOSBs were also later adapted to civilian purposes such as selecting civil servants and firemen. Background Following British defeats and German successes with Blitzkrieg in the early months of World War II, Members of Parliament and the British media expressed concerns with how the British Army was being led. There was a notable shortage of officers, with a shortfall of 25% meaning that the War Office was unable to properly staff units, and there was a high proportion of breakdowns. In addition, the Army was perceived as old-fashioned and inefficient, as well as tainted by social bias. On a more local level, Assistant Adjutant-General Colonel Frederick Hubert Vinden observed that there was a very high failure rate at Officer Cadet Training Units (OCTUs): he visited each board in 1941, and pinpointed failings in the Command Interview Board as making poor selections of officer candidates and thus causing the failures. Psychiatrist Eric Wittkower of the RAMC had been conducting research on \\"problem\\" officers who had broken down or caused disruption, and concluded that these men lacked 'ability or qualities of personality adequate to withstand the stresses of their job.' When Wittkower and Vinden met in a pub after Vinden's visit to the final OCTU on his tour, the result was a discussion about how to improve officer selection by utilising psychological methods. Wittkower had been passed a copy of the selection methods used by the Wehrmacht, and so Vinden and Wittkower met with psychiatrists Thomas Ferguson Rodger, A. T. M. Wilson and Ronald Hargreaves, and the head of Scottish Command, Sir Andrew Thorne, who had been military attach√© in Berlin in the 1930s and seen the German methods being used. The group made plans to experiment with and adapt these methods for use by the British Army. Army psychiatry was dominated by psychiatrists from the Tavistock Clinic, and so many figures from that organisation were involved in officer selection from the earliest experiments. =Edinburgh experiment= In summer 1941, Wittkower and Ferguson Rodger conducted experiments with the German officer selection tests at the Company Commander's School in Edinburgh headed by Alick Buchanan- Smith. The procedure involved: # Written self-description by the candidate. # Life-history obtained by interview. # Group intelligence test. # Observation test. # Choice-reaction test. # Performance-under-stress test. The observation test was ruled out as not useful, and the choice-reaction test and performance-under-stress tests gave only low positive correlation with the psychiatrists' assessments of candidates' personalities and so were dismissed. Though the results of the intelligence tests were not available in time to be used to assess the candidates, they were assumed to be useful and an advisory committee even suggested that officers should only be chosen from those who scored highly on intelligence tests. Historian Nafsika Thalassis has argued that this reflected the widespread view of the time that intelligence was a national problem that touched upon many areas of life. The Edinburgh experiment was assessed based on how well the psychiatrists' conclusions about officer candidates matched with commanding officers' assessments. Out of 48 men studied, there was essential agreement in 26 cases, substantial agreement in 12 cases, and essential disagreement in 12. =Bowlby & Southern Command= Concurrently with the Edinburgh experiment, John Bowlby conducted research with officer candidates at an OCTU in Southern Command, Wiltshire. He used Raven's Progressive Matrices and interviewed candidates and then rated them on the same four-point scale that the OCTU used. His assessments of the candidates matched with those of commanding officers in 34 out of 36 cases and were deemed a success at picking out capable officers. A memorandum was drawn up in late 1941 to report the results of the psychological experiments to the War Office, and specifically to Adjutant-General Sir Ronald Adam, who was responsible for personnel issues in the Army. Adam expressed satisfaction with the methods and encouraged the War Office to approve a new system. WOSBs The Army psychiatrists' proposals for officer selection on psychological lines were well-received and an experimental unit, No. 1 War Office Selection Board (WOSB) was established in Edinburgh and opened on 15 February 1942. The first WOSB was based in the Genetics Institute headed by Francis Albert Eley Crew in the King's Buildings of the University of Edinburgh. Colonel J.V. Delahaye was the first WOSB President. Wilfred Bion was the Board Psychiatrist, and Eric Trist the Board Psychologist. The first sergeant-testers were Alex Mitchell and David O'Keefe, and the first Military Testing Officer was Captain W.N. Gray. 10 batches of candidates passed through the experimental WOSB: under the new system, rather than a simple interview candidates went to a large country house and underwent three days of testing incorporating various methods. In April 1942, the War Office expressed its satisfaction with the scheme and commanded that WOSBs should be created 'throughout Great Britain as fast as possible.' Boards were hosted in country houses, which had the space to accommodate candidates and the tests. WOSBs were later also created overseas. Boards were also created for choosing women officers for the Auxiliary Territorial Service, staffed by women including women psychiatrists. Very little documentation on the women's Boards seems to have survived. At the peak of the WOSBs, there were 19 psychologists (5 women), 31 officers, nearly 600 non-technical officers (about 50 women) and 700 NCOs (about 200 women) working on selection. Between 1942 and 1945, more than 125,000 candidates passed through the WOSBs in the UK, of whom nearly 60,000 passed. In the Middle East, Italy, and North Africa, around 12,700 candidates attended WOSBs and roughly 5,600 passed. =Methods= The methods of the WOSBs were intended to select candidates who were capable of managing men and relating well to others, as well as being intelligent and physically and technically capable. To select such candidates, a typical Board took place over a course of 3 days, during which a battery of tests were used. The usual format of the days at Boards was as follows: # New candidates introduced to the Board staff and given arm bands (names and ranks were concealed in an effort to limit bias). They were given written tests including questionnaires, psychological pointers, and tests of mental ability. # Groups of candidates took part in Command Situations which involved obstacle courses and/or discussions and Leaderless Group Tests. # Interviews were conducted and the final conference was held at which Board staff made decisions on candidates. Opportunities were provided for candidates to receive feedback whether or not they had been successful. Mental Ability A recruit takes a test as part of his boards. Though they were often called intelligence tests, advisor John Raven was emphatic that several of the tests used at WOSBs were not intelligence tests but tests of mental ability. Tests included verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests and a version of Raven's Progressive Matrices that was specially created for WOSBs to better distinguish between those at the highest end of the mental ability scale. Psychological Pointers Various \\"psychological pointers\\" were used to help highlight areas that the psychological members of the WOSBs may like to follow-up on in later interviews or observations. The pointers were determined by three psychologists: Jock Sutherland, Eric Trist, and Isabel Menzies Lyth. The \\"pointers\\" included a self-description, word association, and thematic apperception tests. Command Situations & Leaderless Groups Candidates were expected to demonstrate their ability to relate to others as a leader or in a more ambiguous position via Command Situations and Leaderless Group tests. As the names suggest, in Command Situations, a person was given command of a group whilst they completed an activity or held a discussion and behaviour was observed. In Leaderless Group tests, no leader was appointed to the group, who were then set a task to complete. The task was the \\"set\\" problem, but the \\"real\\" problem which psychologically trained observers were judging was the participant's ability to balance their desire to do well as an individual with the need to work with and support other members of the group. Leaderless Group tests in particular were credited as changing 'the entire character of the WOSBs' because the innovation made the Boards centres for experimentation and learning. Questionnaires & Interviews Two questionnaires were given to WOSB candidates: Questionniare I covered education, occupation and hobbies and Questionnaire II covered medical family history and so only medical members of the Board were permitted to read Questionnaire II. The final component of the WOSBs was interviews. The interview method was intended particularly to help the Board to make decisions on borderline candidates who had been highlighted by the preceding tests. There were also two interviews: the Board President and the Board Psychiatrist both interviewed candidates. At some boards, the two interviews led to conflict and jostling for power between the President and the Psychiatrist (see Reception, below). Reception The WOSBs seemed popular with the majority of the candidates who went through the system, with questionnaires revealing high satisfaction amongst both successful and unsuccessful candidates. Complaints from those rejected came predominantly from those with a public school background. However, there was hostility to the WOSBs from some senior Army figures such as Bernard Paget and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill actually appointed an Expert Committee to investigate the work of psychologists and psychiatrists in the services, with the particular intention that they focus upon uses (or misuses) of psychoanalysis. The psychiatric interview was a point of particular concern. In 1943, the Expert Committee ruled that no more than half of candidates should have psychiatric interviews, and later that no questions about sex or religion should be asked. Psychiatrists at Boards got around this by re-defining a \\"psychiatric interview\\", issuing a memorandum that asserted that a \\"psychiatric interview\\" was one which dealt with particularly sensitive topics but an interview with a psychiatrist along general lines was simply an interview and therefore unproblematic. Validation In numbers, the WOSBs also appeared to have been successful. Between 1943 and 1945 the failure rate at OCTUs fell to only 8% despite an overall decrease in quality of army intakes. A follow-up study indicated that 76% of officers selected by WOSBs were providing completely satisfactory service. Psychologists Philip Vernon and John Parry (members of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology who worked with the Royal Navy) criticised the WOSBs scheme for technical deficiencies. They argued that as the Board President had the final say, there was variation across WOSBs depending on how far the President accepted psychological methods and guidance. In 1950, psychiatrist Ben Morris and Chief Psychologist to the War Office Bernard Ungerson, exchanged articles in the journal Occupational Psychology discussing the validity of WOSBs. Ungerson questioned the validity of the WOSBs; Morris published a defence in response to Ungerson, arguing that the WOSBs could not be assessed based on officer quality, as this was affected by training which was completely separate from selection. Legacy Some of the methods used at WOSBs (and No. 21 WOSB itself) were used by the Army psychiatrists in early investigations of problems with repatriated prisoners of war. The WOSBs were a precursor to the Army Officer Selection Board that is in place today. During World War II, WOSBs selection methods were adapted for use by armed forces all over the world, including in India and Canada. WOSBs were also adapted for use as Civil Service Selection Boards (CSSBs), for use by the Office of Strategic Services, Unilever and other commercial enterprises, and for fire services, police forces, etc. The staff who created the WOSBs found that they had many shared interests. Calling themselves the \\"Invisible College\\" (in reference to the Invisible College who were the precursors of the Royal Society), they went on to form the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations after the war.

It disappeared when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936. History Miguel Maura wanted to lead a party dedicated to keeping the founding principle of the Liberal Republican Right alive: instilling the conservative masses of the new Republic with secular, Western-style right-wing ideals, free from the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Its foundation was widely welcomed by many right-leaning political sectors and moderate newspapers, and soon after, many local party committees were created, with Maura, a brilliant orator in the Spanish Congress of Deputies, as their reference. Despite this success and the fact that Maura acted as the Leader of the Opposition against Manuel Aza√±a‚Äôs government, the party obtained poor results in the 1933 election, winning only 17 seats ‚Äì less than the Liberal Republican Right did in 1931. Instead of supporting the Conservative Republicans, most right-wing voters elected candidates of the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups (CEDA), a Catholic and corporatist party with sympathies for Fascism. Soon, Maura‚Äôs approach to politics, based on his personal charisma, and the growth of the CEDA brought the party to its representation ceiling; it ran few candidates in the 1936 election and only got 3 seats. Their last significant political action was running candidates for electors in the presidential election that took place in April of that year. By doing so, they were the only conservative party, along with the nationalist Catalan Regionalist League, not to boycott the process. Their votes went to the only candidate with chances to win, Manuel Aza√±a, and the party disbanded soon thereafter as the Spanish Civil War started.

He was one of the first African-American journalists to work on a mainstream white-owned newspaper, the New York Post. Poston is often referred to as the \\"Dean of Black Journalists\\". Early life Poston was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. His mother, Mollie Cox, died when he was ten and he was raised mostly by his eight older siblings, while his father, Ephraim, taught the Kentucky State Industrial College for Negroes (now Kentucky State University) in Frankfurt, over two hundred miles away. By the age of fifteen, Poston began his career writing articles for his family's paper, the Hopkinsville Contender. In 1928, he graduated from Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial College (now Tennessee State University) and moved to New York City to pursue a career in journalism. Career Poston became a reporter for the New York Amsterdam News, a weekly newspaper geared to the city's African- American community, in Harlem in 1928. By 1935, he became editor of the paper, but was later fired after attempting to unionize his fellow reporters. The following year, he was temporarily hired by the New York Post in 1936, making him the third Black to be hired as a reporter for a major New York City daily paper. When he was assigned to the NYPD press room none of the other reporters would talk to him. Within the ranks of the Post, he was considered a star reporter and was a favorite of owner Dorothy Schiff. Over the years, Poston used his influence with Schiff to lobby for the hiring of more black and Puerto Rican reporters. During his thirty-five year career at the Post, Poston covered many important stories of the day, such as Jackie Robinson's entrance into Major League Baseball, the Brown v. Board of Education case and the efforts of the Little Rock Nine to integrate schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. While covering the story of the Little Rock Nine in 1959, Poston was shot at by a group of white men. He also covered the Scottsboro Boys trials with much difficulty as the Alabama authorities would not allow a black journalist to report in the segregated South. He had to resort to disguising himself as a preacher and turning his stories in secretly with the help of white colleagues. In 1949, he was pursued by white mobs when he attempted to cover the Groveland Four in Lake County, Florida. He safely escaped and wrote a series on the Groveland Case. During World War II, Poston temporarily left New York to work for the Office of War Information in Washington D.C. There he served as \\"Negro liaison\\" for the Office and was a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Black Cabinet. After Roosevelt's death, Poston joined other black journalists in pressuring Truman to desegregate the military. Later years Poston retired from the Post in 1972 to work on a collection of autobiographical short stories. He was unable to complete the work as he suffered from complications from arteriosclerosis. He died on January 11, 1974, at his home in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn. Legacy Poston was one of the first journalists inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame when it opened in 1990. In 1999, his series on the Groveland Case was named one the 100 most important journalistic works of the 20th century by New York University's School of Journalism. His book of short stories was published posthumously in 1991 as The Dark Side of Hopkinsville. Personal life Poston was married three times. His first wife was Miriam Rivers (m. 1935‚Äì1940). In 1941, while working in Washington he married Marie Byrd Tancil, a staffer for Robert C. Weaver. The couple divorced in 1956. Poston married Ersa Hines Clinton in 1957. She worked for New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. They remained married until Poston's death in 1974, although they were separated at the time. Poston was friends with Langston Hughes and traveled to the Soviet Union with him in 1932 to appear in an anti- segregation film. He also lived next door to his friend Thurgood Marshall for many years.

Similar facilities are available in other states. Some states such as Queensland have multiple types, depending on whether the holder is working or not, and whether the holder uses metropolitan transport. South Australia provides an all-in-one card, allowing access on public transport in Adelaide through an RFID capability in the card. The purpose of the card is to identify seniors and to take advantage of discounts offered to senior citizens in the state or territory, with a number of commercial offers being made available to holders. While reciprocal acceptance of the card could be made across states in some cases, there is no guaranty or standard policy to do so. It differs from a concession card in that it is available to senior citizens of the state or territory regardless of whether or not they receive an age pension. The Seniors Card has a logo of the Seniors Card scheme, the name of the holder, an identifying number, generally some logo of the state or territory issuing the card, and often the words \\"The holder is a valued member of our community. Please extend every courtesy and assistance.\\" While it may be used as a secondary identification card, the absence of a photo and security features make it less useful for identification purposes than a photo card or a driver's licence.

The classical result in the area is that simulating an n-state nondeterministic finite automaton by a deterministic finite automaton requires exactly 2^n states in the worst case. Transformation between variants of finite automata Finite automata can be deterministic and nondeterministic, one-way (DFA, NFA) and two-way (2DFA, 2NFA). Other related classes are unambiguous (UFA), self-verifying (SVFA) and alternating (AFA) finite automata. These automata can also be two-way (2UFA, 2SVFA, 2AFA). All these machines can accept exactly the regular languages. However, the size of different types of automata necessary to accept the same language (measured in the number of their states) may be different. For any two types of finite automata, the state complexity tradeoff between them is an integer function f where f(n) is the least number of states in automata of the second type sufficient to recognize every language recognized by an n-state automaton of the first type. The following results are known. * NFA to DFA: 2^n states. This is the subset construction by Rabin and Scott, proved optimal by Lupanov. * UFA to DFA: 2^n states, see Leung, An earlier lower bound by Schmidt was smaller. * NFA to UFA: 2^n-1 states, see Leung. There was an earlier smaller lower bound by Schmidt. * SVFA to DFA: \\\\Theta(3^{n/3}) states, see Jir√°skov√° and Pighizzini * 2DFA to DFA: n(n^n-(n-1)^n) states, see Kapoutsis. Earlier construction by Shepherdson used more states, and an earlier lower bound by Moore was smaller. * 2DFA to NFA: \\\\binom{2n}{n+1} = O(\\\\frac{4^n}{\\\\sqrt{n}}), see Kapoutsis. Earlier construction by Birget used more states. * 2NFA to NFA: \\\\binom{2n}{n+1}, see Kapoutsis. ** 2NFA to NFA accepting the complement: O(4^n) states, see Vardi. * AFA to DFA: 2^{2^n} states, see Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer. * AFA to NFA: 2^n states, see Fellah, J√ºrgensen and Yu. * 2AFA to DFA: 2^{n2^n}, see Ladner, Lipton and Stockmeyer. * 2AFA to NFA: 2^{\\\\Theta(n \\\\log n)}, see Geffert and Okhotin. =The 2DFA vs. 2NFA problem and logarithmic space= It is an open problem whether all 2NFAs can be converted to 2DFAs with polynomially many states, i.e. whether there is a polynomial p(n) such that for every n-state 2NFA there exists a p(n)-state 2DFA. The problem was raised by Sakoda and Sipser, who compared it to the P vs. NP problem in the computational complexity theory. Berman and Lingas discovered a formal relation between this problem and the L vs. NL open problem. This relation was further elaborated by Kapoutsis. State complexity of operations for finite automata Given a binary regularity-preserving operation on languages \\\\circ and a family of automata X (DFA, NFA, etc.), the state complexity of \\\\circ is an integer function f(m,n) such that * for each m-state X-automaton A and n-state X-automaton B there is an f(m,n)-state X-automaton for L(A) \\\\circ L(B), and * for all integers m, n there is an m-state X-automaton A and an n-state X-automaton B such that every X-automaton for L(A) \\\\circ L(B) must have at least f(m,n) states. Analogous definition applies for operations with any number of arguments. The first results on state complexity of operations for DFAs were published by Maslov and by Yu, Zhuang and Salomaa. Holzer and Kutrib pioneered the state complexity of operations on NFA. The known results for basic operations are listed below. =Union= If language L_1 requires m states and language L_2 requires n states, how many states L_1 \\\\cup L_2 requires? * DFA: mn states, see Maslov and Yu, Zhuang and Salomaa. * NFA: m+n+1 states, see Holzer and Kutrib. * UFA: between mn+m+n and O(n 2^{0.79m}) states, see Jir√°sek, Jir√°skov√° and ≈†ebej. * SVFA: mn states, see Jir√°sek, Jir√°skov√° and Szabari. * 2DFA: between m+n and 4m+n+4 states, see Kunc and Okhotin. * 2NFA: m+n states, see Kunc and Okhotin. =Intersection= How many states L_1 \\\\cap L_2 requires? * DFA: mn states, see Maslov and Yu, Zhuang and Salomaa. * NFA: mn states, see Holzer and Kutrib. * UFA: mn states, see Jir√°sek, Jir√°skov√° and ≈†ebej. * SVFA: mn states, see Jir√°sek, Jir√°skov√° and Szabari. * 2DFA: between m+n and m+n+1 states, see Kunc and Okhotin. * 2NFA: between m+n and m+n+1 states, see Kunc and Okhotin. =Complementation= If language L requires n states then how many states its complement requires? * DFA: n states, by exchanging accepting and rejecting states. * NFA: 2^n states, see Birget. * UFA: at least n^{2-o(1)} and at most O(2^{0.79n}) states, see Okhotin for the lower bound and Jir√°sek, Jir√°skov√° and ≈†ebej for the upper bound.

He is also the creator of a new patented vaporization technology for the E-Cigarette called \\"qmos\\" which moves away from the traditional heating methods of first generation vaporizers and e-cigarettes in favor of a wick-less and coil-less technology for longevity and consistency. Ray is also the founder and CEO of The Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association (TVECA), a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a sensible and responsible electronic cigarette market by providing the media, legislative bodies, and consumers with education, communication, and research. He successfully defended the position of the e-cigarette as an alternative tobacco product as opposed to a drug delivery device in the United States in 2009 and defeated the Dutch government in The Netherlands in their attempts to ban the e-cigarette in 2012. Ray alongside the TVECA is currently working to duplicate this process in other parts of the world where there exists highly prohibitive or restrictive laws pertaining to the e-cigarette. Prior to this, Ray founded an Electronic Cigarette company in 2008 called \\"Smoking Everywhere\\". As owner of Smoking Everywhere, Ray initiated the litigation against the FDA claiming the e-cigarette was indeed a tobacco product and not a drug delivery device.

She uses the voice as her main medium in video, performance and sound installations. The position Van Imschoot occupies in the Belgian art scene is characterized by a movement between the institutional field and the medias, through which she experiments with already existing contexts, if not creating her own.Documentation Centre of the House of Performing Arts La Bellone, Brussels. Content in French. http://www.bellone.be/FR/persondetail.asp?IDfichier=1702773 Myriam is a founding member of Sarma and runs within this organization a publishing house for digital artist publications that embraces orality. She forms a duo with sound poet Marcus Bergner (Arf Arf).  Biography  Myriam Van Imschoot graduated in Germanic Philology and specialized in Performance Studies at the University of Leuven in Belgium. She worked as a dance critic for Gazet van Antwerpen from 1993 to 1995 and De Morgen from 1995 to 1998. In 1995 she became a staff member of the Institute of Cultural Studies at the same university. In 1998, Van Imschoot left journalism and became a full-time researcher, with the support of the Fund for Scientific Research. She completed a PhD on improvisation in cultures of spontaneity and the post-war avant-garde. As an artist, she started working first with archives as her medium. The duet Pick up Voices (2007) with performer and choreographer Christine De Smedt and the sound installation Black Box (2009) show an interest in the performative potential of archival documents and the construction of alternative historiographies through them. Her solo Living Archive (2011) was a personal testimony of what could be \\"any girl living next door with a passion for mixed tapes\\". Acclaimed for its originality, it was shown in Kaaitheater, Vooruit and Buda Arts Centre, among others. Fascinated by phenomena of long-distance communication, Van Imschoot started a cycle of works that deal with yodeling, crying, waving and bird calls. Hola Hu (2013) and Kucku (2014) are yodel duets that reframe folklore as it gets transmitted and altered. The yodel duets tour in galleries, theaters and concert halls, sometimes accompanied by the video installation Yodel Portraits. She also used video as a medium for LIFT and Efemeriden, both filmed from her apartment located in a signature building in Brussels. The work of Myriam Van Imschoot has been presented by Sculpture International Rotterdam (The Netherlands), Nodar Binaural Sound Center, Rumpsti-Pumsti (Musik), MUU Galeria, Playground Stuk (Leuven, Belgium), Jan Van Eyck Academie (Maastricht, The Netherlands), Kaaitheater (Brussels, Belgium), Vooruit (Ghent, Belgium), Kunstencentrum Buda (Kortrijk, Belgium), Museo Reina Sofia (Madrid, Spain), De Player, Operdagen Rotterdam (The Netherlands), Pact Zollverein, Techno Park Studios, Campo, Kiasma Theater (Helsinki, Finland).

Features  The \\"Residential complex on D≈æid≈æikova, the architectural ensemble\\" is the National monument of BiH As in many other cases around central parts of Sarajevo, neighborhood designers utilized the presence of abundant natural greenery on the location and developed designated space while preserving as much as possible. This became a characteristic of the neighborhood, one which constitutes important quality and attraction.  National monument  In 2008 D≈æid≈æikovc was proclaimed National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina as \\"Residential complex on D≈æid≈æikovac ‚Äì the architectural ensemble\\" by the Commission to preserve national monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to its architectural and landscaping qualities.
